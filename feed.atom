 I'm bee trying all sorts of robocopy commands as I'm building a new file server and I need to copy the data over, but I seem to always miss files or directories. I'm using a domain admin account.
 This is what I'm using, can you think of any modifications to it that might help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My lecturer said that it's layer 5 as it's associated with authentication but every network professional I asked at work said it's layer 7 as 2FA interacts with applications and the end user.
 Initially I thought it was layer 7 from my understanding but upon researching more, I'm stuck between the two as 2FA is authenticating (L5) but is also interacting with end users and applications (L7). Is it possible that 2FA works at both layers?
 Btw in my scenario 2FA will be protecting access to a network's server as well as applications. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking into the process of renaming an Active Directory Domain, out of curiosity rather than the need to actually do this in production.
 The process itself, using the rendom utility seems straightforward and is well documented online.
 There are, of course, caveats and unsupported scenarios i.e Exchange on premise.
 It is obviously a major change to the core structure of a network as you are changing AD name, Dns, renaming Dcs, Group Policy, and Pcs.
 My question is ... have you ever done this in a production environment and, most importantly, how did it go?
 Was it smooth sailing?
 Were there unexpected consequences or issues post rename?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for venting but this pisses me off. Also English is not my first language, so bear with me.
 ​
 To set up the scenario: I am 40+, working 20+ years in IT and do something IT management and network engineering related nowadays. Started off somewhere around the Y2k problem with floppy disks in my hand ;)
 ​
 Yesterday a somewhat recently retired neighbour of mine approached me via WhatsApp if I could come upstairs in the evening to help with "an IT problem related to hard disks". This was the first time in the last 12 years we live here.
 ​
 I texted back that I am sorry but I do not do any IT support outside my family, because the small issues could easily escalate in terms of time and knowledge invested and that this was abused in the past. Got no answer.
 ​
 Today I met him outside the house and was getting blasted with how angry he is and how I lack a sense of community and how "all IT people" tell him the same (ah?) and that we all need help (what?). And that his question would be something about his TV and that is HDD is now empty/blank.
 ​
 To top it off, he yelled at me in front of my kids while we were on our way to get a Christmas tree.
 ​
 Really?
 ​
 Am I supposed to get 'ready for work' on a Friday evening after an exhausting week to peek into something which is both outside my expertise (datacentre != TV) nor interest?
 ​
 Why is it that non-IT people seem to take it as totally granted that you fix any consumer product because "you work in IT".
 ​
 I am totally sick of it. Am I the asshole or do I have one as neighbour?
 ​
 Any advise, pat on the back or other form of moral support is appreciated :]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope this is the best sub to post in. I have a 20-year career in Infrastructure. Lots of Linux/Unix. Lots of networks. General infra like VMware, storage, sysadmin etc. I have moved to use the cloud in the last 7 years as well. I have (finally) been promoted and now find myself Head of Infrastructure. It's a lofty title for what I actually do but it's good. I have two teams I supervise, an infra team of more classic sysadmins, and a DevOps team which is developers who are interested and work in infra stuff. My role is extremely hands-on around 50% still doing infrastructure engineering but I am gaining more staff so that will continue to reduce with time.
 I am planning for the future and looking at similar roles to see what I need to be aiming for. What I am interested in right now is what sort of interview questions should I expect for these sorts of roles. Since I didn't interview for my Head of role I've never had a management interview. 
 What are the general questions I should expect, is there any changes to my interview style over engineering roles I need to anticipate? (I found being extremely relaxed and personable worked very well, but I understand cultural differences here come into play as London and Stockholm, where I have worked, are very relaxed environments for engineering roles where that might not be the case where you are from). Any other general advice anybody might have?

 I realize that this feature is still in “preview”, but it is so annoying enrolling the users with a csv. Why do you have to set the UPN in the csv? Why does Microsoft not let you assign them once the seeds are already in azure? We don’t really care for the idea of keeping a seed file around while we wait for new users to onboard so we can assign them. 
 Then having to activate the token after the fact takes forever when you have large groups onboarding. 
 I would love to only use authenticator, unfortunately we cannot force them to use their personal device for it. 
 Does anyone have insight into this or workarounds?

 But is it just me, or is it unnecessarily cumbersome for both the user and the administrator? I kind of get the administrator part, that's to be expected. But launching a completely different window seems like it's really going to get on users' nerves and be a hard sell to decision makers. Especially when the decision makers/contributors themselves are the ones that have to be on external sites regularly.
 It would be nice if the Application Guard instance opened in a new tab rather than a whole new window similar to the IE mode.
 How do others manage Application Guard?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I'm planning on making some changes on a network, because we are short on ports.
 I have 2x Layer 3 core switches as cluster.
 There is very little inter-vlan routing on it.
 ​
 However, I have a lot of servers that are connected with SFP modules.
 To avoid having to additionally buy 2x very expensive layer 3 core switches, I would like to buy 2x layer 2 switches with 24 SFP ports for the servers.
 I would then connect them redundantly to the core switches as distribution layer.
 ​
 At least that was my idea.
 However, I can't find any Layer 2 switches with more than 4 SFP ports at all.
 Do such devices even exist, and if not, why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sys admin and part of my jobs are processing file. half an time file has all kind of error, and my legacy system has hard time to pre-parse and figure out the error. so I want to have a pre-processor to validate the file against the spec. common error is like this
  
spec has 200 fields, csv contains 195
 field should be A or B or C, but cvs contains 1.2
 field is required, but csv has blank value
 field is limit to 255 characters, csv send 300
  
should this be a python, shell script, cmd line (I am using windows)? is notepad++ has a plugin for that?
 Thank you!

I called 4 times today, and kept getting told the person on my case was either on a call or on lunch and I would get a call right back. Here we are 20 min before I am about to leave and I just called again after being told at 2:20 that the agent was on lunch and to try back in 30 min. So just called and was told they are on lunch and try back in 30 min...so they taking a 2 hour lunch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm walking our property with a fiber vendor and two of our closets have multimode patch cables to the access switches but the actual fiber run to the patch panel is single mode.
 We've had probably 30+ accesses switches with multimode fiber running without issues for longer than I've been here. No errors or oddities I've seen on the connections. 
 To test this, I did hook up a switch using single mode optics/fiber and sure enough it connected. No errors on the port etc.
 Does anyone know the technical reason this works? I would assume there would be bigger issues due to the diameter size of the cabling differences?
 edited for some clarity.

 I have been beating my head on the wall trying to fix this weird issue: when I move computers to a different OU (with different Policy), the computers would still obeying the old policy that was applied to them in the former group.
 For example, I was having a container where computers are locked out after 30 minutes of inactivity and another container where computers are locked out after 8 hours.
 I moved a few computers from the 30 mins group to the 8 hours group.
 I ran gpresult /r on said computers and the results showing the new policy was successfully applied (8 hours). Local group policy showing that they are supposed to be logged out by 8 hours. But lo and behold, the naughty computers still locked themselves out after 30 minutes.
 So far I have tried many fixes, including 
 - Clear group policy catches
 - Took them off the domain, force policy update there, and put them back on.
 - anything else I could think of.
 ​
 Have you ever run into this issue? Please enlighten me! (I am a new system admin and inherited this weird ass system that needs a lot of reorganizing).
 ​
 Thank you so much!

 We are getting 1000 Mb/s cable internet dropped to a pole on the property and it will be my responsibility to bring it into the building and get it to the network cabinet.
 There is an existing 3/4 underground conduit that I will be using which might limit me to RG6 rather than RG11.
 The run will be around 150' of underground conduit and then 150' of running inside the building to the network cabinet.
 Will 300' of coax cable potentially give me loss issues? Am I overthinking this, can I just grab a 300' roll of RG6 copper clad steel cable from Home Depot and send it? 
 I also have the option of putting the cable modem in the building right where the coax enters and then go with 150' cat6 back to the cabinet but I'd like to avoid this option as I would much rather keep the modem with all the other network stuff.
 Any advice?

 The city network in my are assigns a Vlan per customer which easily adds up to over 4096. They do this so the can authenticate every users traffic to a RADIUS server which returns what ISP that customer has a contract with ( which also allows us to choose between many diffrent ISPs). 
 What i was wondering is what they use to make sure they have enough Vlans. Double/tripple tagging or Q-in-Q? If so which would be more efficent for a network running up to 200 000 Vlans? 
 Wouldn't a tagging method use up a lot of processing power to tag/untag
 Does anyone have experience with these kinds of network structures?

 We’ve all been there before - the wording from a third party when something is fubar. The lack of updates, and in this case phrasing straight out of the offshore 1st line support playbook. This issue is at 12 hours odd now, to still be in the investigation stage says they know what’s wrong, it’s big, they don’t have a fix, or, they have no clue, which 12 hours in is a worry. 
 At this point, if you have users in rack space hosted email, I’d be looking at standing up a new solution to give functionality from now, and worry about historic data later - I fear this may not be a quick fix, or even something with a full fix. 
 I can’t think of anything that would create a 12 hour outage of exchange/hosted exchange that’s still in investigation (figuring out wtf is wrong) beyond something that is known, and the investigation is how the fuck do we unfuck this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a design proposal to connect multiple customer's networks to AWS using IPSEC S2S VPNs. This is straightforward for the most part. Establish VPN tunnels between AWS and the router. I am wondering if an alternative design might work where we configure a device (such as a Juniper SRX320 -- but open to other device suggestions) and ship it out to the customer with instructions to plug cable A into a network with internet access (such as a guest network) and cable B into the target network. Can the device behave as a standard client on the B interface (including receiving a DHCP address) but still allow AWS traffic to access devices on the network without being the default gateway for that network? The reason for this approach is it would simplify establishing VPN connections for customers as they would simply have to plug a device in instead of adding VPN configuration to their router.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at various UEMs to help us manage our Windows workforce, much of which is remote (working from home), off the corporate network. Today we use PDQ Deploy + Inventory and love it, but it's limited to on-net management. PDQ Connect is coming and looks like it's going in a good direction, but I've got almost 1,000 PC's to a manage now, so I'm open to alternatives - and the solution that keeps coming up is Microsoft Intune. 
 We would like an application deployment solution that is flexible but will also let us run Powershell scripts, create groups and reports, and ideally provide a way to access the remote computer over the internet. Bonus if it works for Mac as well as Windows (though we are 99% Windows). One of the things I've seen with Intune that I really like is the ability to create PC profiles and once a user logs in to Azure AD, Intune (or Autopilot?) automatically deploys a profile to the computer. That seems powerful. 
 Other thoughts on Intune as a potential alternative (or accompaniment?) to PDQ?

I been studying for 4 years now, I been working net eng 1.5 years, i worked in 3 top companies in their relative industry on the country level, so i consider my self very lucky to start from startline with being network engineer, currently im sr. Net eng, i been in this position for 4 months it's really boring, my whole career i worked on countless projects none of them are complex all of them were too basic for my taste, I'm really good network engineer i got the companies i worked in out of huge jams faster than most sr. Net engs there with 10+ years experience, my current job took boring to another level, i really started losing interest in networking, I'm thinking maybe i will get in pen testing starting with OSCP i already have solid networking and programming knowledge, but just in case i find 3-5 years from now i made a mistake, can i get back to networking? Will it be possible without getting my salary jabed?

 I recently added a second Nexus and connected it to the original via vPC. We will not add a second MPLS link to this switch, but would like to add it as a BGP peer to the carrier. Is there a best practice or suggested "port" to configure the IP address used for peering in this scenario?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been asked to create an IT solution for a management issue. They want me to block YouTube on a single machine. My first thought is to do this at the network's firewall but ran into two issues. Our firewall is managed by our ISP, so it could take a while to implement, and I'm not quite sure how to target the single machine that's on DHCP, by MAC address maybe?
 Anyways.
 My current solution is to modify the hosts file and dump each web browsers cache. I have a PowerShell script for the hosts entries because YouTube has quite a few, and then I manually dump the browser caches. Any ideas how the user could get around this (beyond the obvious, user can edit the hosts file themselves because everybody here still has local admin, against my recommendations), or is there a better way?
 $baseEntry = "`n127.0.0.1`t" $ytDomains = @() # string array of domains I found here: https://www.netify.ai/resources/applications/youtube # cant list them, as previous post was removed because some are url shorteners foreach ($site in $ytDomains){ Add-Content -Path $env:windir\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value "$($baseEntry)$($site) www.$($site)" -Force } ipconfig /flushdns nbtstat -R

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is the correct sub for this, but maybe.
 my business has become the target of someone who is repeatedly autodialing our primary reception phone number. we block the number that's coming up as call ID, but then the attacker changes the number and starts again. Our phone provider (a voip pbx provider using voip.ms as their trunk) says they are not able to identify the original number but have confirmed the numbers are spoofed. The attacker calls periodically and berates the receptionist looking for some information that we don't have, and has told her they will jam up our switchboards until we give them the information. This has been going on for about 3 weeks. The caller has said they are in south africa, though the numbers they call from are 10 digit north american numbers. My receptionist took it on herself to give the attacker some fake information that she thought might satiate them, but it was quickly identified as false and seemed to enrage them further.
 I discussed this with the RCMP (canadian police force) and they were able to call to one of the numbers that the attacker had called from and speak to them and told them to stop. However that was about as effective as you'd expect. The RCMP said there was nothing additional that they could do and to contact the anti-fraud division (which I'm going to be doing today with limited expectations for success)
 So, given that I am not able to block the calls as the call ID keep changing and my phone provider isn't able to identify the actual source of the calls in order to provide to law enforcement, what options remain?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been with a company that I've been very committed to for a number of years. The pay was ok, the commute was short, and it's a top tier position for the rural area I live in.
 And for the last two years I've been actively recruited for a Senior Network/Systems Engineer position with a tech firm who has high margins and a small number of employees. I'll be next in line to the CTO- with a clear path to his position.
 The nature of this company is that they do not really have much other than technical employees- and I'm running the show.
 It's also a very good paying gig.
 And while this is the best move for me there's an emotional component I've not not really felt before.
 There's no red flags or misgivings... but a lot of sadness. I more or less rescued the company from technical oblivion and built out fault tolerant systems which have really paid off.
 I'm going to miss my day today at this company. The people I can still have a relationships with.
 It was hard to see real sadness in the CEOs eyes when I gave him notice.
 Then there's the excitement of the new position. Lots of perks. Underground parking. Working with a strong competent team. 
 And yet- even though I am leaving my current position for all the right reasons.. I still feel sad.
 It's a big change.... and off we go.

 I am a SysAdmin* for a services company that has a workforce that changes frequently as it is contract based. We can go from 150 workers to 600+ in a matter of hours. As such, we are primarily in the "cloud" using virtualization services.
 Nonetheless, we still have a a physical HQ and a handful of full-time employees that require hardware. We are about to dump our MS and will be facing a situation wherein we will not have a means of safely/reliably obtaining the limited amount of hardware we occasionally need. We have tried Amazon with mixed to terrible results (and, honestly, we would be loathe to reveal this during an ISO audit) and companies like CDW are too rich for our blood, and companies like DELL and HP are not all that interested in entering into a lease program as we are very small potatoes. 
 So, do any of y'all have suggestions? It is important the source is reliable and on the up and up as we are ISO compliant and would like to keep it that way.
 Thank you!

 Let's say I want to bind my server so that it ONLY listens on my subnet, and not accessible via public IP. If it is bound to 0.0.0.0 then it would bind to all available adresses, but I would like it to bind to the LAN IP only. If I already know my Local IP then that is easy enough, but it can change due to DHCP. I am testing this on a python3 simpleHttpServer like this
 python -m http.server 8080 --bind 192.168.0.0/24
 But this does not work. Is this a limitation of this python module?

 Regarding VMs. Is the behavior the same? Does memory truly reset?
 I have a data archive on a proprietary time series database that is telling me it needs help. I cycled the server yesterday morning and it is still complaining. My gut tells me there is a flag on the file somewhere that I need to reset. I'm looking for it. Can't find a KB on it though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i'm at a loss as to what to do about a fingerprint issue we're experiencing. We've previously enabled Windows Hello for Business and everything has been working great for probably a year now. 
 Now, all of a sudden the fingerprint readers are being super weird. They will work right after a reboot just fine, but after some time goes by when you next go to login it just doesn't act like you've touched the fingerprint reader at all. However, after unlocking with the password and then immediately locking the pc again it works perfectly! But if some time goes by... same non responsive issue. It does not give any failure messages.. just acts like it hasn't been touched.
 I have disabled usb selective suspend, disabled the pc from turning the device off to save power within device manager. Uninstalled antivirus, fully went through windows updates, updated all gpo policies with the newest templates and double checked them to make sure nothing changed. I've also made sure domain controllers were up to date on updates.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? It seems to be domain wide as it's not just one pc and it's the exact same symptoms on everyone of them.

We do have scavenging enabled for the default of 7 days for the No-Refresh Interval and the Refresh Interval. I'm assuming this is what's removing them. My understanding from Microsoft is that "Windows computers that are statically configured for TCP/IP try to dynamically register host address (A) and pointer (PTR) resource records." And, "Windows registers A and PTR resource records every 24 hours regardless of the computer's role." So if these servers are supposed to register every 24 hours, I don' understand why they're being scavenged. Are there specific logs that can help me troubleshooting this? I've looked through event viewer but didn't find anything helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for a long time people were grousing that there's some slowness on the network, but we really could not pinpoint the exact cause of it.
 Last week the financial department complained that their financial program keeps on bombing out. So I decided to step in this week and try to find the cause of this issue for once and for all.
 Everything networking at their workstations was replaced. Flyleads was tested prior to being installed, and yet the problem persisted.
 A couple of tests later, and everything pointed to either a network cable fault issue or something on the core switch.
 Today we got in the "expert". He followed my test steps, and agreed that there is something funky going on, it either is the cabling or the core switch.
 So off to the server room we toddled, and do a few more tests on the switch. Same results.
 So we decided to reboot the switch by pulling power and bring it back on. He wanted to warn the people, but I know that people will just be dragging out the reboot because they have "important" things to do. Like finish watching that youtube clip with the hot chick, or do some work on their important resume. So... power was pulled. Future me won't be pleased with myself should it come back to bite my a$$.
 Switch rebooted - and the one blade did not come back up. Found the fault, yay.
 But it also cut out the internet because our CPE was connected to that specific blade. Took a little juggling around of cables, but we got everything up again.
 Now we will have to wait for a replacement blade, but in the meantime things should be OK for now.
 And the good news is, that slowness is now gone.
 I t was bound to pop sooner or later anyway, better that it popped whilst the expert was there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know it's a longshot, but do any of you use Solarwinds to monitor APC/Cyberpower devices? Our parent company just added these to the Solarwinds instance, but do not actually monitor anything "power related" (outlet usage, voltage in/out, etc). All they show is historical availability, ping/packet loss, and basic device info.
 I was wondering...
  
What options exist for monitoring these types of devices? (electricity, ping, connected devices, etc)
 What do you specifically look at?
 Anything else I should be aware of?

 We're evaluating a software program and one of the recommended specs is related to resolution. 1680x1050 resolution with 32-bit color support. 
 I understand that the specs on the monitors need to show 16.7 million colors. Where I'm confused is what spec do I need to look at for the graphics card in a laptop or desktop pc. For example, when looking at a laptop that comes with 
 Intel UHD Graphics 630
 and 
 i5-10500T processor,
 nowhere on the intel specs page do I see anything related to 16.7 million colors or 32-bit color.
 Intel Core i510500T Processor 12M Cache up to 3.80 GHz Product Specifications 
 If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it. 
 Thanks in advance.

 I am having an issue with one of our customers (work in an MSP).
 On their host server (win svr 16 std) they have a data drive where they only have some VM VHDX files stored. Windirstat reports that approx. 850 GB is being used.
 But Windows reports that there is 204GB free of2.17TB.
 We are unable to find what is causing this disparity.
 We initially thought the issue was due to shadow copies from their anti-virus, but we've deleted all the shadow copies and it only cleared a small amount of space. Shadow copies are now set to only use 10% of each drive. There was an issue with the previous version of the AV client that would fill the drive with shadow copies, however this was resolved in the latest patch.
 We believe that there is still space allocated to, or hidden shadow copies, however windows reports that only approx. 90gb is used for shadow copies.
 We're stumped on this one, any ideas? Has anyone seen this before.
 Happy to provide more info where I can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought you folks might be interested in an email scam I received yesterday; an email that said I had an outstanding invoice that needed to be paid from PayPal.
 Now I obviously this tripped my scam senses, but it had made it to my inbox through google's spam stuff and I couldn't immediately work out how it was a scam, the email appeared genuine, it did actually come from PayPal, it had passed SPF, DKIM etc, all links went to genuine PayPal URLs.
 It was then I realised what the scammers had done.
 PayPal lets you use them for invoicing, if you have a PayPal business account (or more likely if scammers have access to a compromised PayPal business account) you can go "Create me an invoice, send it to this email address, with this information in it"
 They raised a real invoice for $500 and in the information where you're supposed to put details about the invoice they had just put "This money will be invoiced immediately, If you wish to contact us about this charge, please phone xxx xxxx xxx", at which point you end up with a scam call centre who will work you through some sort of banking refund scam like you see on Kitboga, Jim Browning and Mark Rober et al.
 But for all intents and purposes, this looks like a real email that has genuinely come from PayPal, because it really has genuinely come from PayPal.
 One to watch out for.

 Basically we have a local office which has 3 subnets (country A - HQ):
 - Corp LAN- Corp WIFI- Server
 Country B:- Corp LAN- Corp WIFI
 Country C:- Corp LAN- Corp WIFI
 Countries A through C all have their DHCPs via Windows Server.
 To pass compliance, he - manually enters EACH machine's MAC address for WIFI and LAN (DHCP reservation) - so giving the illusion that - you can't plug your personal machine onto corporate network - when we all know - MAC address cloning is a way to bypass.
 The problem comes when people travel between countries and can't connect to network, so he adds their MAC to that country's DHCP server
 So the question to my fellow sysadmins, what solutions / products are there on the market to make this less painful to manage?

 We don't have the funds to get one from Avigilon they're not cheep 
 The current server is showing its age, it's a Xeon E3-1220v5 with 8GB and 16TB of storage (H730 card) from Avigilon look like so kind of dell server i think.
 i have no idea what makes a good CCTV server so any help will be grate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 my company acquired a customer who is using Lotus Domino 9 with no absolute intention to switch to other products (Exchange Online, etc...).
 We use Veeam Backup & Replication to make backups and replicas of the entire virtualized infrastructure (hypervisor is VMware).
 I spoke with the company who manages Lotus Domino and they told me that almost all backup products are not compatibile with LD databases i.e. even Veeam can fail to backup it through VSS causing inconsistencies when restoring data. According to this company, the only ways to make it work are: 
  
update to LD v12 that has some internal features to manage backups.
 use Veeam with batch scripts to stop LD services at the beginnning of the job and to make them start at the end
  
This customer have an ancient backup software, Symantec Backup Exec 2012, that used to backup the LD database but right now is not working. I know nothing about LD and I know this is a hell of a situation.
 Still, I wanted to know what do you do in these cases, do you know a software that works with LD DBs? What is it your experience with LD DBs?

 02:30 "Um, it's down at Microsoft per https://portal.office.com/servicestatus"
 Kind of curious why they call it Teams (Consumer) but I presume it includes our Teams since it is down and we're down.
 Oh what is this email from our Network & Firewall guys about one of our ISPs (Spectrum) accidentally turned off our circuit but it's back up? Not related to this since Teams is pinned to Verizon currently but let me do some stuff to verify everything is OK. It is.
 03:00 Time to go back to bed...oh, Teams status has turned green. Light me double check. Ru-roh, we're still down. curl -vk https://teams.microsoft.com is getting resets. Works from home to the same IP address.
 Fire up tcpdump on our outbound ISP load balancers (link controllers)...yep, we're receiving RST packets from Microsoft -- i.e. they're actively rejecting us for some reason sigh
 Should I mention we have zero, zilch, no access to our tenant and need to engage $corporateOverlords whose native language is not English for any information regarding anything hosted by Microsoft?
 Reconfigure the load balancer to send Teams traffic out our generic outbound Verizon IP instead of the one that is dedicated to Teams...we're back up. 
 Email boss to tell him $corporateOverlords will need to look up the logs or contact Microsoft for an explanation.
 03:30 Ok, let's see if I can unwind and catch some sleep...

 ​
 As some time did pass by since the Broadcom acquisition of VMWare, some of you did eventually move over to another product.
 ​
 ​
 I am still evaluating:
 XCP-ng
  
Offers 24/7 Enterprise support
 Has some performance limitations with single-threaded storage processes
 No application aware backups
 Active community
 Very responsive developer-team
  
​
 Proxmox
  
VERY limited enterprise support (austrian business hours)
 Very flexible storage backend support
 No application aware backups
 Active community
  
​
 I think, backups are an important point, that is not great for both solutions. A solution with limited enterprise support 
 ​
 What are your thoughts?

 Best wishes

So far passing files from one to another is done using usb drives. I was thinking of connecting the PC with the internet to one of the PCs in the offline network and use a simple ftp server using Python scripts to automate this process. 
 Now the question is, will that beat the purpose of the "offline" lan network security? Is there any standard way of keeping the Internet and the lan network fully seperate, like transfer the files ONLY through the python script and keep the lan network invisible from the Internet. Or no matter what I do, there will always be vulnerabillities and the 2 networks can't be truly seperate once a there is a wired connection between them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at some previous collegues work history to see what paths they took and it feels like I have somehow had an unfair advantage and have moved up in my career much faster than others, yet I feel incredibly average and potentially below. Has anyone else felt this way? It's like imposter syndrome but only because I'm doing better than some others.
 I can usually find the answer to any problem or work with the right people effectively to solve most issues but I feel like I'm lazy, I make mistakes, I don't go after certifications, I don't homelab, I have lukewarm social skills, I'm not amazing at interviews, I don't network very well, my written skills are average at best, I can't clearly state my thoughts to executives, and sometimes I'm just overall inefficient at my job. 
 Yet I know I'm capable of doing my current job without a doubt, but I worry about being replaced by someone better constantly.
 So when I see someone stuck in a T1 job for like 4 years, it makes me question whether or not I deserve to be in IT Manager role after only 6 years. It makes me think I've just relied on luck or white privilege this whole time.
 This is by no means bragging. I just want to know if anyone has felt this way before?

 Summary: server is receiving the syn packet but is not responding with syn/ack packets
 I have already checked the following:
  
Ports are listening/open
 No iptables/firewalld/SELinux blocking the connection
 No changes to OS level prior to the issue.
  
I have been reading that turning off the TCP timestamp resolved this issue. However, I am concerned as this may have performance consequences. 
 Appreciate any response. Thanks!

What policies do you enforce to make the whole offboarding process simple, clear, and streamlined?

 removed other active user (postgre) through PowerShell

 OS reinstall is an easiest solution but that is not an option now.

 This is just a desktop without local network.
 What else I can check to track why PC acts like this.

 PS. Also, there are 2 wifi routers in cascade with 2 different NATs. This is happening for a main router (which is connected to modem). When switching wifi to secondary wifi router (connected to LAN port of primary router) than issue disappear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At my current org, I'm planning several projects around us going from on prem/hosted Exchange to Azure/M365 via Microsoft Business Premium Licensing. I saw an opportunity to replace our current EDR (ESET) for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. However, I'm somewhat overwhelmed with all of the settings that can be set. The more I read, the deeper the rabbit hole seems to go. Note that this is for a small company that doesn't have any industry-specific cyber security regulations though certain regulations are stipulated in the insurance we have for potential cyber attacks. There are some obvious settings that should be turned on, but I'm not finding any particular guides online for a minimum secure configuration. Anyone have any helpful resources?

 I know it can be set by running a command on each system:
 Set-NetIPInterface -AddressFamily IPv6 -InterfaceIndex $(Get-NetIPInterface -AddressFamily IPv6 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InterfaceIndex) -RouterDiscovery Disabled -Dhcp Disabled
 However, if we did that, we would have no reporting or auditing showing the current status of each system.
 Is there a GPO or registry setting for Windows that accomplishes the same thing so that the configuration can be easily audited?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm relatively certain I know the answer on this one, but wanted to get some outside confirmation - a type 2 route redistribution into OSPF will have a flat metric throughout the OSPF topology (1 if redistributing from BGP, 20 if redistributing from anything else, at least for Cisco's implementation). 
 In contrast, for type 1 routes, the router doing the redistribution into OSPF doesn't try to add any cost based on the protocol it's being redistributed from. Say router XYZ is redistributing a static route to 5.5.5.0/24 as a type 1 route. Would it be correct to say that other OSPF routers in the topology calculate the metric for 5.5.5.0/24 based on their cost to reach router XYZ, and that router XYZ's perceived metric to reach 5.5.5.0/24 doesn't matter (static routes seem to have a "metric" in show ip route of 0 anyway)? If you had your reference bandwidth set to 10g, it wouldn't matter if the static route to 5.5.5.0/24 had a next-hop address associated with an interface running at 10g, 1g, or 100m; the OSPF topology is only considering the cost to reach router XYZ, and router XYZ won't try to artificially inflate the OSPF cost if the bandwidth on that interface changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm sort of looking at where to start here. I'm doing some labbing and want to set up a network that utilizes some VPNS that will be using certificates for the user and device authentication. Most all of my experience is simply with shared secrets. I've gone through security training and know what most of the components of PKI are individually, and I've generated certs in small projects before. However, getting an idea of how this infrastructure would be built and maintained well is kind of beyond me. 
 ​
 Can anyone recommend some good resources to go through that would give me a good idea of what I need to build up, and how it would all sort of function together? It seems like it's that odd part that isn't networking but plenty of times it's our responsibility.

Nothing was standard, alerting all over the place, I got to do all sorts of cool things. Worked on my own automation projects, build redundancy in for offices, actually saw things that could be improved, proposed the solutions and was given the green light. Felt I was actually contributing and making a difference, it was hectic however it was also fun.
 I ended up quitting in august 2021 to study and travel. Got my CCNP and got a job at a large financial company. Everything here is so dialed in that I ssh into a device maybe twice a week. Haven’t even needed a console cable cause our OOB is setup well. Everything is automated, alerting on point and Im realizing how green I am because I have zero ideas of how to improve anything. I find myself only really sending emails, working with vendors to get gear, ISPs to get circuits, plan office expansions and never ending meetings. I feel I don’t actually do any networking stuff. Spoke to my manager about this and he said ‘welcome to being a senior engineer….’ Not only am I in no way a senior but is this really the future of this career path? I am finding it so boring and have none of that tinkering/ trying to get something to work. 
 I understand my job is to provide reliable network access, but holy hell is it boring when it all works well…..

 Seems straightforward enough, but I have been down the yang road before and its actually not as straightforward as I would think.
 How does one go about actually building a netconf xml based yang model for this? From what I understand you need to determine which yang structures should be used to build your xml netconf from. I found that the openconfig interface yang model does everything I need except applying a vrf to the interface. Then I found Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-cfg, however this yang model has way more settings its not very clear how I use this model properly to create the above interface…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been in IT for more than 25 years, and had about a dozen jobs in various companies/industries of different sizes. I never really liked IT, but was generally good at it and it paid well. The best jobs are when I had a fun team, worst have been from bad management. I eventually change jobs for whatever reason: company closing, management, bored, whatever. I have always thought about changing professions during my career, but I don’t know if I would feel better doing that or not. Or have any idea what I would do anyway. I don’t like the idea of continually changing jobs, especially in my 50s, I average about 2-3 years per job, but I am pretty sure I am not in the right place to finish my career in 15-20 years.
 I never felt fulfilled or proud of my career path, and dread mondays and going into the office 3 times a week, but the days go by quickly given that every day is different. All in all, things are ok, I’m hybrid, get paid well, little work outside my 40 hours, my management leaves me alone, I’ve always gotten good reviews when I had them. I don’t really connect with my team, and fear I would be released if layoffs come. Some days, it’s a struggle staying above water from both the complexity and quantity of work, most days I stare at the clock waiting for quitting time.
 For the most part I’ve been an admin: windows, linux, storage, virtualization, cloud, and dabbled a bit in of security, databases, scripting, networking. Not sure if I should stay where I am, switch to a similar job as admin, change to something like IT security , or change careers entirely.
 Where are you at? Experiencing the same feelings? Am I burnt out or being whiny?

 We took a capture from the F5's during the failover. There is no ARP being sent from the PA. When an F5 BIG-IP fails over, it will GARP, finding the routers Gateway. This will fulfill the PA's ARP table. After 30 minutes exactly (the ARP cache refresh timer) the PA will drop the entry because it will not send an ARP for the F5 virtual-server IP. Basically, we're only seeing connectivity at failover due to the F5 GARP for the router's Gateway IP. 
 Has anyone ever experienced a Palo Alto not sending ARP for a singular IP on a subnet before? Or, could someone maybe explain why this is happening?

 Like CPU load can be very low and it will not pass that much traffic. Then looking at premade appliances it seems the cpu is not that important to the amount of threw-put a box is capable of. 
 So my question is, if the cpu is not doing the cyphering then what is?

 I had a job for three months with an MSP and none of the techs liked me there. I got fired due to culture fit. At my current job I am bashing with my bosses boss as well as an app consultant because I am asking questions or detailing the frustrations that the users have with our equipment and software when it seems like nothing is getting fixed.
 How do you learn how to keep your head down and work with technologies or even people you think are inferior? Is it the fact that I don't have the knowledge that I think I do? Is it the politics of crappy workplaces? I have 8-10 years of IT exp and still generally help desk support at various roles/companies, could that be the reason? 
 Why do I think IT should be about investigating problems and making sure they get fixed and do not reoccur when in reality it is actually about putting bandaids on things until you can't take it anymore and leave? I guess this is why they call hell desk hell. Even though I generally don't have the problem with dealing with users like most people lolz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. Our company is evaluating the transition from on prem servers to cloud servers, and I'd like to ask for your advice. Our current environment includes 2 sites while each site has 1 Windows server (to work as DC, DHCP and print server) + 1 Windows file server. GPOs are in place to mount network drives and printers. We also have NSA to work as firewalls and VPN connections for remote users.
 Our major plan is to replace the file servers with Nasuni edge appliances. That will bring us 'small cache file server' to each location. But the executives are considering replacing the current DCs to cloud VM. 
 From my premature understanding of cloud resources, this looks possible by running a VM with site-to-site VPN connection to on prem networks. Remote users will still connect VPN before they could reach the DC for authentication. But would there be any issues/concerns for the features like AD, printing, DNS, GPO, etc.?

This was a impromptu solution to losing our IPS. The 3rd FTD is a routed firewall in our equinix location. Currently I have a rule on the FMC that says any zone any source any destination with the application Spotify set to Block. 
 I would figure that rules would follow the top down pattern and say if its not spotify traffic then move it along to the next rule. Instead whenever I do a packet tracer it hits that rule with a allow on about any piece of traffic I do... So basically its a permit ip any any. 
 What am I doing wrong ?

Does anyone in the OUI realm know if the +1 integer HEX increase is standard industry wide? So if I have say a MAC ending in AF the next in line will be B0? What happens when you get to FF? Do vendors just increase the value in the next bit and then start at 00? I would assume they have to?

I get the security aspect and how it does more to authenticate users and devices than just saying "Oh you're on the domain? You're good." However, it seems to be purely security. I don't see how it actually connects you to the network? It looks more like something you would use in tandem with a VPN, but everyone talks about it as a one or the other type of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having an issue with the BGP failover and trying to find the best way to solve it. Topology is here: https://ibb.co/myN4xXn
 I did not design this network, I inherited it. My knowledge of BGP is shallow but I used it successfully in many simple networks.
 Site 2 uses Site 1's ExpressRoute to reach Azure when MPLS and Site 1's ExpressRoute are available. When not site 2 uses direct site to site VPN tunnel to reach Azure. Failover and failback work correctly when MPLS fails, but I am running into issues when ExpressRoute fails. When ExpressRoute fails Site 1 still advertises routes to Site 2 because it learns them through Site 1's site to site VPN. I don't want that.
 Site 2 uses weight to prioritize "MPLS" over Site to Site VPN to Azure. In Azure I am pre-pending AS to make one path less desirable.
 What I simply want to do is prevent Site 1 from advertising Azure routes to site 2 when they are learned through Site to Site VPN, but for some reason I can't wrap my head on how to do that. I know I need to use a route-maps to do it, but how to configure the route map and where to apply it is the question.
 Conceptually I think I need to first tag/identify routes when they are learned through site to site VPN Azure BGP neighbor, and then I need to deny those routes from being advertised to site 2.
 Right now I am using same route-map on site 1 for both Azure BGP neighbors. I think I will need to split that and use different route-map for each neighbor. 
 It seems that I can use "community", "origin", "tag", and "route-tag" to make routes from one neighbor different than others.
 On premise equipment are FortiGate firewalls and ideally I like to make all changes on them. I want to avoid, if possible, to make changes in Azure.

 This program uses the ms-graph api to get all the apps, configuration policies etc. and displays the result in a GUI. You can even export your findings.
 From a safety aspect u probably should get a c# programmer to look into it, before using it in your main tenant. But I tried it on our test tenant and it just worked. (and ofc I only gave the user I used a read-only role)

I want to implement the below design, where the core switch would be connected with trunk ports to the INSIDE interfaces of both firewalls, then the OUTSIDE interfaces would come back to the core switch on access ports on VLAN X, and we connect to the ISP on an access port on VLAN X. We do "sw mode access" and "sw nonegatiate" on those OUTSIDE switch interfaces and, of course, prune VLAN X from the trunks to mitigate VLAN attacks.
 https://www.ccexpert.us/firewall-config/switch-2.html
 I have been told by my colleagues that our IA people will freak out, and will not accept having the INSIDE and OUTSIDE networks on the same hardware. Does anyone know of any documentation, or design guides, or proof of concepts from reputable sources that I can take to convince them this is a secure design?
 Conversely, if someone knows a specific exploit that makes this unsecure, please share.

 I was asked to take a look at the bill a customer is receiving from the local phone/internet company. I actually don't know what is normal for these, I don't typically see the bill, and was hoping for some help.
 They have dedicated fiber and there are two spots on the bill that lists our circuit number. I'll alter the numbers slightly but leave the ratio between the two amounts.
 The first item says "Dedicated Internet" and is 800.00 That makes sense to me.
 The second line items says "Megalink Port per DS1 Rental Period of 36" and is 650.00
 Not sure what that second one is. Is that a rental for their gear? Is that normal? 
 We have the typical small box from the carrier with our circuit on it with the cables coming in from somewhere in the building to it with a Cat6 cable hanging off it we plug into our firewall. I hope we are not renting that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm enabling Windows Hello from Endpoint Manager using a Configuration Profile (so I can do a staggered deployment).
 When I add a user to the Configuration Profile it eventually asks them to reboot, then they try to login and it asks them to setup Windows Hello. Once they complete the setup they try and enter the PIN they just set and get “This option is currently unavailable” and they can only login with their domain password.
 After a bit of time the PIN suddenly starts working and I have no idea why.
 This is a hybrid environment so I suspect a password sync needs to happen before Windows Hello will work properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day
 I have a client that has an engineer working from abroad. This person connects to a virtual machine on a server that shares an NVIDIA Tesla GPU to draw CAD models. If the engineer is on-site at the office, connection is established through a site-to-site VPN. If he works from home, he dials in to the main office through client VPN. Ping ranges from 200 to 250 ms.
 The performance of the virtual machine is sufficient, but since we are using RDP there are significant limitations to the user experience. Manipulating models or watching videos is - as you may expect - laggy and not very pleasant.
 I followed this manual and allowed H.264/AVC hardware encoding in the local group policies of the machine. There is a significant improvement compared to the regular RDP settins. Can you think of other ways to boost the user experience when working over RDP? How do I get the most out of this protocol? Thanks for all the suggestions.
 Before you bash me for this setup - it was not my idea - I inherited the setup from my predecessor.

 So far (almost half a year) I've used to connect to the vpn by just providing a username and a password. Today When I tried to connect, it asked me also for private key password which I don't know which it is. 
 Is there something need to be changed in the config due to some openvpn update or something is going bad?
 My openvpn version is :
 OpenVPN 2.5.8 [git:makepkg/0357ceb877687faa+] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu [SSL (OpenSSL)] [LZO] [LZ4] [EPOLL] [PKCS11] [MH/PKTINFO] [AEAD] built on Nov 1 2022 library versions: OpenSSL 3.0.7 1 Nov 2022, LZO 2.10 
 Any idea is welcome. I'm asking here because a couple of months ago our IT has left the company :-/

 Just have a support ticket in regarding the LinkedIn Sales Navigator intergration for our CRM org. 
 Issue seems to be it isn't loading some of the details when used in Outlook on the Web, but it's fine on the app. Tried a few searches but not getting much specific to my case. Already tried basics like cache and ingonito etc.

 In the past when you gave Full Access to a users mailbox through the GUI in Exchange to another user this did not allow the delegate to see Private Items this was always an additional setting within Outlook that the user would have to set.
 It seems now this has changed and that when you assign a delegate to a mailbox through the GUI this also gives that delegate access to the Users Private Items.
 I should add this seems to only have changed recently on Cloud Exchange
 Microsoft have confirmed seemingly this is by design which has actually raised a big concern of privacy.
 Has anyone else had anything similar?

Instead of working on problems/projects, they solve them by using Outlook (getting someone else to do it). 
 I’ve had a place where I worked with a person like this, but currently, due to no fault of my own (policies and procedures) I see myself becoming a mailman.
 Have you noticed this phenomena? How do you approach working with colleagues like this? And what steps do you take to remove yourself from that kind of position if you see yourself in it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping this community has a solution for our need. We run a network on a military installation for personal use internet connectivity. We need a means to test internet speeds at about 10 buildings of the 200 we are connected via cable, switches and PTP radios. We have a 1Gb broadband connection which we give soldiers 50 down and 2 up. Last year we decided to try it with Raspberry pi4’s but they seem impossible to get our hands on anymore. We did get 2 last year and loaded with speedtest cli. We distributed these to two buildings and it works flawlessly. Getting old laptops or old pc’s running in attics would work but I’m looking for something small like a raspberry that I can plug into a switch in an attic get my stats and dump them into g drive. Or perhaps there is a small IOT device that is purpose build to do that. I’m trying to stay in raspberry pricing per unit. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, long time lurker short time poster - forgive me for formatting. We have a strange issue TAC support are taking weeks to resolve (even as a P2 ticket), I wondered if anyone else has experienced this issue. 
 We have 250 APs, around 12 of those are R500 the rest R510. These are connected to a vSZ controller with non-proxied radius requests. A couple times a day, the entire cluster will drop connections and no one regardless of PSK SSID or an 802.1x SSID can connect. In this time, you cannot SSH into an AP and invariably you cannot SSH into the vSZ either. Ruckus Support seem to be having problems pinpointing the issue in logs and have repeatedly asked for logs between 3-5 mins after the issue occurs. Our controller is running 6.1.0.0.935, R510 running 6.1.0.0.1595 and R500 5.2.1.0.1038 
 We see a lot of AP-Disconnected events along with RADIUS server unreachable at the time of the incident. Has anyone experienced this issue themselves?

 we're facing some issues. Currently we're running AWS Managed Active Directory with Pass-Through Auth to M365. Now we need to enable Hybrid Azure AD join.
 I got the error not a member of Enterprise Admins group (yes, it's a managed AD, so you have no Enterprise Admin).
 Then I tried the ConfigureSCP.ps1 Script which the MS Agents suggest -> Access Denied.
 I tried to update schema via AWS Console -> only in CN=Schema....
 Any suggestions, or has anybody got it working?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently trying to double down on some bad practises we have on company PCs. I have removed all users as local admins on their PC, due to users installing some applications which are not work related.
 Some of these users are Technicians which go on client sites to troubleshoot products, which require them to change their Laptop NIC Card IP Address and install drivers. 
 I have solved the NIC Card issue by including their AD account in the 'Network Configuration Operators' Local Group on each of their PCs respectively.
 The driver install problem I can't seem to wrap my head around. They only need to install drivers from a specific vendor, lets call them 'Vendor A'.
 Is there a way to enforce a GPO on these users, which allows them to install applications and drivers by 'Vendor A' only without the need of admin credentials, while asking for admin credentials for any other app/driver install?
 I have searched the web for a solution and found there is a way to have trusted and untrusted publishers in an AD, but wasn't able to make it work as I need it. 
 This is for around 10 users running Windows 10, connected to an AD installed on windows server 2016. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The old ones have come back and the company wants to essentially wipe them and either give them to employees, or charity, as they are fully functional, just no longer fit for our site due to cyberessentials+
 Lucky me: the user's don't remember what pin numbers they had set on 3 of the phones and they had decided it was a good idea to make a random one (so IT can wipe the phone easier)... Then they forgot the code.. and the devices had already been deleted from airwatch....
 I've looked online and all I really see are jailbreakers and paid pin unlock suites, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a free tool that can either remove the pin, or fully factory reset the devices (I've tried iTunes and the usual recovery with no joy), or if there is a way to re-enroll the devices back into airwatch temporarily to use the pin removal tool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I’m a sys admin in a team of three that own several applications as well as their hosting environments. I’m six months into this new job and have suddenly been thrown into a couple projects. 
 Unfortunately for me, my boss threw me into an ongoing project cycle due to one of our sys admins being out for several weeks, so I’m in the fire. I’ve been given a technical documentation by our vendor which I’m told is full of useless and confusing information and I need to basically decipher and translate it to work for the environment we have. I’m still new to our environment and applications so figuring out how to make this work within our infrastructure is extremely daunting. There are people I can ask for help but many of them are busy with their own tasks and projects and I don’t want to come off as helpless. 
 The company I work for is ridiculously understaffed and unorganized, so there is zero structure or timeline to these projects as well as very conflicting deadlines. I’ve literally been asked if it was possible to take this new project given to me and implement the entire thing in a non prod environment within 24 hours, no freaking way. All the while being asked by product managers and my boss for constant updates on other projects assigned to me. It’s extremely soul crushing. I’m so new to everything that it seems impossible to get anything done within the time frames they’re asking for and give updates. The micro managing is extremely severe to the point where I am asked for a project update every single hour, most of the time I’m still trying to figure out what to do and don’t have an answer. If I’m lucky one of the more senior guys will schedule a meeting with me later in the day to point me in the right direction. I’m starting to feel like I’m just not smart enough for this role and want out of IT completely because it seems like I run into this same issue with every job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hate SCCM, never like it. It takes too much effort to maintain and it only works 50% of the time. 
 In saying that, Im trying to install Teams using Teams Wide Installer during a Task Sequence. It installs successfully and drops a Teams.exe in Program Files (x86) for a 64-bit installer and a registry key:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 
 Name : Teams Wide Machine Installer
 Type: Reg_Expand_SZ
 Value: %ProgramFiles%\Teams Installer\Teams.exe --checkInstall --source=default
 So according to Microsoft Documentation : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/msi-deployment
 Whenever a user signs into new Windows user profile, the installer is launched and will install teams in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Teams
 However, the user install does not happen. When the user logs in, they can find Teams anywhere. The only workaround to install teams is for them to to Program Files (x86)\Teams Installer and run Teams.exe. 
 This happens to all new builds and the user logs in for the first time. Anyone have similar experience or perhaps any SCCM guru that can shed some light on this? Any advice would be really appreciated

 We have another set of servers that was deployed by our MSP as a hyper-v cluster before I joined and I’m not impressed. Things I can easily do in vSphere are either overly complicated or just don’t work as well. 
 The two things holding me back from going vSphere are keeping uniformity across systems and the uncertainty of the Broadcom deal. 
 I’ve got more experience with vSphere which is why I’m leaning that way and can easily justify the extra licensing on the cost our MSP would charge for all the migrations if we went hyper-v. 
 Any thoughts or advice?

 Let's say that the test coordinators insist you keep running it and switch ports, but you've already burnt through all 10 of them. Even worse, even after an hour it still says the ports are in use, and there is only a scheduled restart at midnight, and your shift is 9 AM.
 Is there a command or something I can run to free up a stuck port? The resources I'm reading online isn't exactly helping, and this is holding me back from a MUCH better assignment. Thanks!

Looking to peel off 80/443 from AnyConnect clients and send to Palo so we can disable Zscaler PAC file. Currently have set up ACL for test client, tied to route-map (that points to Palo) and assigned to WAN interface. Testing shows that ACL/route-map is hit and should send to Palo but unable to see anything in pcaps on the ASA or Palo indicating outbound web based traffic is leaving the ASA. Debug shows hits:
 br: policy based route lookup called for 10.5.33.10/63738 to 172.217.168.227/443 proto 6 sub_proto 0 received on interface WAN
 pbr: First matching rule from ACL(21)
 pbr: route map AnyConnect_to_Palo, sequence 10, permit; proceed with policy routing
 pbr: evaluating next-hop 10.5.7.23
 Packet tracer shows its getting dropped on NAT, phase 14, rpf-check, as its not expecting traffic from that subnet on that interface. In theory, it sounds like it should work but Im not seeing where its getting dropped to the Palo. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Ill attach a basic topology too. Thanks.
 Edit: Reason behind design is that the Zscaler service contract is up on 12/31 and looking to not renew for an entire year when we need maybe an extra few weeks in to 2023 to move all end users to GlobalProtect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Definitely a rant, but I've noticed this most jobs other then those I've held in MSP or medical fields. As we speak, I am constantly being pinged by a new hire because no one is teaching him how do anything. I'm talking about functional things related to his job, like workflows, software tools beyond normal "here is your computer, this is how you log on to the network and email" type stuff. 
 Shouldn't it logically be his team or supervisor teaching him? I only have a peripheral idea what/how they work, so I'm sure I'm not 100% telling him the "right way". I keep stressing that he needs to ask other people, but no one else is answering him. 
 I'd say it was an org issue, but it was this way to an extent at previous employer as well. I trained people across the organization there as well.

 Apple Device on network 1 is not able to screen share to network 2.
 network 2 is more secured and is not allowed to talk to any of our other networks. I am not sure if it would be using a different port. I am not seeing anything. Going off of Apple's site, Airplay uses 80, 443, 554, 3689, and 5353 which I have made a rule for that to be allowed.
 Any direction would be helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone
 I'm a fairly new network associate at a huge workplace (~40K employees), and it bugs me beyond belief that not a single decent topology drawing of the company's bigass network exists.
 I'm mingling with the thought of starting the project of mapping the entire infrastructure of the company (it's a huge project which will never be complete, I know), but I don't think a tool like Visio or Drawio would cut it, since it would become too huge too fast (unless these programs have functionalities that I don't know about).
 Is there any tool out there for drawing up massive topologies? I'm thinking about 'layering' functions like e.g. a geographical topology where I might open up a location, where I might choose between e.g. physical, L2 or L3 topologies pr. location, etc. A cascading system, if you will, where only the wished for information is displayed at a time.
 Hope the question makes sense!

 At my first job interview with the company, I talked to H&R and the external IT advisor. They told me that the old Sysadmin left the job months ago and have been without support for some time.

 - No, you cannot tell IT to buy your department all new laptops and pay for them out of IT’s budget. I don’t care what you promised your department.

From my understanding, this needs to be an FQDN/DNS, otherwise the certificate for the Session Server would be invalid. Anybody any insights, how i can force the Load balancer broker to offer me the hostname/FQDN/dns name of the session server? 
 Or should the Broker give me an hostname and i did something wrong?

 First off I hate Mac's for enterprise use. They are such a pain in the ass to manage. Anyways, we use openvpn and for some reason only Mac computers refuse to use the internal DNS. I can hit resources by IP but not by name and if I get on a Windows PC using the same VPN settings it works fine. I tried adding our DNS server in system settings on the mac but it still wont resolve names. Anyone else have this happen? How do I fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I am a sysadmin in a company and I manage around ~170 Servers. Some of them are phyiscal, some virtual. Most of them run Windows Server 2012 / 2016 /2019 as their OS, but we also got some Linux Servers.
 So now our issue: We literally got almost no documention for our servers. We have list of our hostnames, but that is it.
 To better understand our current state: Recently our main FTP Server broke down because the Windows OS was broken. The server was not bootable anymore and therefore the config for the FTP server (IIS) was lost. Of course, no one knew how the FTP Service was configured in terms of directories, local users and other software. So we build up a new Server from scratch (which was the easy part) and talked to every service provider usising this FTP Server and telling them that the credentials and hostname / IP has changed (which was the not so nice part).
 We recently got the brilliant idea that it might be good to know what kind of Servers we have, which applications they are running and how they are configured.
 The first idea from one of my colleagues was to make a word document for every server, where we can wright the specs inside, which applications it runs and what steps were taken to configure the software (with screenshots). But yeah, let's just not do that....
 And now my question: What is the best practice for Server documentation? I googled a bit of course and found some tools for documentation, but most of them are not free for testing or just don't look that good to use.
 The way to document should have some kind automation to it and have a nice usability, so that my colleagues stay motivated to document.
 So should be just something dull like Word, Excel or Visio (which is easy but frustrating to use) or some kind of software, which scans our servers and document them? I think a hybrid of both things would be nice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question for publishing printers by site bsaed on the following design requirement:
 Implementing a print release system to use follow-me print across all sites.
 Management want just one print queue published
 We could publish one print queue from one server and allow the system to manage the follow-me function, but there's also the requirement to ensure local print facilities are available in the case of a single site failure / link failure.
 It appears to be a limitation of the system we are using (or the design we've gone with) to have failover across sites - though I am also checking with our managed print provider, as I'm not the project manager just the technical lead.
 Currently using group policy, print perferences then item-level filtering to say if at X site then create printerX@serverX.com
 If at site Y create printerY@serverY.com etc.
 What I'd like to do is avoid a build up of printers in their list though, so if at site X I only want X printer deployed to that device. If they then take that laptop to site Y, deploy printer Y on login but remove printer X. The plan is the queue name would be the same on each server so to the end user it "looks" like one queue wherever they go
 Is that even possible? I worry it could increase logon times
 Any other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use shared local admin accounts with password auth on the infrastructure I inherited (~6 admins, many (hundreds) of machines). This worries me, any ex employee will still have access unless we go and change a lot of passwords. Automation is not really a thing here yet (I know, I know).
 Looking for a better solution I started to create an ansible playbook to roll out authentication via sssd/ldap. This basically works, everyone from the "sysadmin" group can now login via ssh and their individual passwords on my test machine. Accounts are automatically granted sudo rights based on group membership.
 Now, I have a couple of questions with respect to this approach:
  
Is there a way to preseed the sssd cache before first login? An admin might have to handle an emergency on a machine he’s never logged into and at that moment ldap might not be available. If not, any recommended alternative approaches?
 
I would prefer key auth over passwords but I don’t have much control over the AD/LDAP infrastructure so I don’t think I can store public keys there (and delegate ssh key lookup / caching to sssd). I could rollout and revoke keys via ansible but I’m unsure on how that would play with sssd/ldap. Like, when an account is locked in AD but still has an authorized key, can they still login?
 
Given all admins have sudo rights, what would be required steps to make sure they can't access servers after they left? E.g. would we have to cleanout their authorized_keys in addition to disabling their users in AD/LDAP?
 
 Any inputs are appreciated.

 I've a frontend server with fpm 8.1 and nginx.
 2 cores and 4gb of RAM.
 A few days ago I upgraded from 18.04 to 22.04. I've kept the php fpm and cli version and did not change any fpm settings.
 Since the upgrade fpm consumes on average more cpu and I even run into issues that the fpm pools cant work the requests and I receive timeouts. 
 I can see that the load is close to 0 in the night when I dont have any traffic. And my traffic did not change in a way since the upgrade that might explain the higher need of cpu. 
 Is there any known issue regarding this? Any other package versions that come with 22.04 that might interfere with fpm?
 Thank you!

 everything besides the modem is Cisco so im guessing there wont be any compatibility issues but ive never setup a network so im unsure of the things ill need (data/info about my network, certificates, etc), best practices, things to look for, tools, test that should be done, general rules, monitoring, security, etc
 so if somebody could help me out and tell me the "procedure/process" you guys personally go trough when setting up an enterprise network or point me in the direction i need to go it would be very appreciated
 my networking experience is limited as before ive only worked in "big" companies and on those ive always had a network engineer or similar taking care of this

 The goal:
 Preemptively install specific drivers (.inf files) and validate that they were installed by returning a specified exit code. 
 Install method:
 pnputil /add-driver $PSScriptRoot\*.inf /install
 Scratch method to discover:
 Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnpSignedDriver 
 What I'm finding is that pnputil is reporting that it successfully applied the .inf file yet when I look for the driver, it's missing. If I can validate the install then I can generate the exit code. This has left me trying to better understand how drivers are handled by windows. Is "applied" installed, stored, or what?

 I’m still green so this also plays into a frustration with handling items a bit slower than I’d like. I also know that I tend to ‘take on the world’ and feel reluctant to ask for help too soon. It is important that I do my due diligence before leaning into my team as I want to ensure I am carrying my weight. Getting my hands on things is also the best way for me to learn.
 As I’m writing this post I believe I may just need to vent but also ask as to whether this is the norm as a sys eng? Because if so, I truly need to adjust in the way that I handle my work and the way it ties into my mood and stress level.
 What’s y’all experience, strategies, and coping mechanisms?

 But now... occupying that same ticket 'slot' is the MFA reset requests " I broke my phone" "I changed phones" "I uninstalled the app"... is anyone else getting inundated with these now and what tooling or processes do you have in place for them? We have been using app absed number mathcing (had it enabled while in preview) as the 'main' MFA method. 
 These days with WHfB users aren't prompted for notification based MFA often - which I think is making it easier for the app based method to lapse/be forgotten about.

I jumped from a systems admin role to IT Manager with only 2.5 years of experience. Even then, I was only handling lower level tickets and worked for an MSP for a year where they literally only had be call Comcast whenever a site went down.. Anyways I feel extremely incompetent as now I’ve been pushed to a director role just 6 months of being here. I just got an intern that I am now training to help me with tasks, but even that requires so much of my time to train on top of dealing with executive meetings and last minute requests from management. 
 Anything related with equipment is basically my responsibility even if I have no idea where it came from or how it got purchased. We have a programs team that is the biggest department in our organization and yet they’re the ones that fail to manage their things and I’m now having to take ownership of their mistakes. I wonder how common this is, and what was your experience as a one man/woman IT. 
 What has helped you with stepping into a leadership role? I’m currently reading the IT Manager Guidebook since that was the only book I’ve found so far, but even so I’m so freaked out at the fact that I don’t know anything and I have so much yet to learn that it’s so overwhelming. Appreciate any advice/resources that has helped you manage a similar situation.
 (btw no disrespect to my intern when I say “1.5” they are just not fully available to assist me. So still it would be a 2 man IT department, don’t want to diminish their contribution )

 switchport trunk native vlan 199. Or is there something else that needs to be done that I am missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, currently we have 2 ASA's in a HA pair for our Web hosting firewalls, these firewalls directly portchannel into our border leaf ACI environment where the servers live.
 The issue is that for our outgoing Internet traffic on our other pair of ASA's, I'm going to use PBR to divert traffic to our new outgoing Palos to avoid a big bang, but for our new web hosting Palos, I can't use PBR because the border leafs go directly into the current web hosting ASA firewalls. So there is no way for me to re-route traffic to reach the new solution.
 All of the clients/servers on the webhosting side have their gateways pointed to the current interfaces on our web hosting ASA's (not on a BD in ACI). So these gateways would need to point to the new solution to. The new solution will have the same interfaces, ip's in the same networks etc... but will be different ip's. 
 I need to find a way to avoid a big bang approach of just flicking over the all the servers gateways to the new firewalls with the migrated rule sets on and hoping for the best. I'd much rather try and find a way to control traffic, like I am doing with PBR on our outgoing solution.
 Hopefully I've explained it clearly enough.
 Thanks everyone

 For this one, we have 2 firewalls in a HA pair for our outgoing Internet traffic, we have public addresses free so I can use them on our new solution instead of being limited to the one on the current solution.
 Essentially I'm going to put a new public ipv4 address on our new solution as the physical IP, all is good expect for the issue that some of our servers use services on the Internet and these services expect the NAT'd traffic to come from our current public IP, we can't afford next to any downtime because of the business we are and we want to avoid a "big bang" approach to this to. Does anyone have any ideas how I can get around this?
 At the moment my only one is to get the services on the Internet to whitelist our entire range instead of just the physical public interface ip at the moment?

 I've been looking at different ways to improve on this. My first thought was to use the same ID method but with a WPA3 PSK so the average Joe on the street couldn't just connect to. But this wouldn't stop someone from leaking the key I suppose in the end.
 So after that I've now thought about an approval process where possibly our 1st line helpdesk could approve access after a user enters their details in with a reason for being onsite etc...
 Has anyone implemented a process like this before. We have a Meraki AP architecture and ISE as our radius server. I was thinking/hoping that there could be a guest splash page that could link into ISE and for ISE to do some cool stuff behind the scenes with approvals.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just today we had an issue where one of the terminal servers went offline and we had to reboot it, causing multiple staff to lose their work. Upon rebooting the server everything looked fine, but we were recieving multiple calls asking if something was down, or if it was safe to log in again.
 I was thinking, it would be great if the IT department had a website we could share with users to just have us post a quick "this server went down, but services will be restored soon." or "Reminder, we are doing maintenance tonight at 10PM" messages that staff could view throughout the day. Mostly just a status and maintenance update kind of site that we can send out when there's a known issue and an all clear.
 The purpose would be, of course, if there is something acting up, staff can bring up the page quick and see that there is a problem and what we're doing to resolve, so they do not have to call in or wonder and call us to ask.
 I'm imaging like a live webpage that we can post messages, but have them read only and not allow for replies, new items go to the top and old messages are pushed down over time. Maybe we can mark older issues a resolved and important information like "If you continue to have issues, please try logging off and back in for better performance."
 Anyway, does that make sense? Is there anything like that we can utilize? I know we can send out emails to staff/groups for updates, but many things do not need to go to all staff, and not all staff need to be aware of issues impacting just certain groups or applications. We were thinking maybe Teams would have something like that, but even so Teams seems a bit underwhelming for that. I'm thinking just a landing page where we can push out quick updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently set up as a "flat" network... Layer 2 is everywhere segmented by VLANs but unfortunately, we use VLAN1 for a lot of things. We are setting up a separate location using Comcast P2P. All the things at this location would need to talk to servers on a mix of VLANS. Eventually, we want to route everything but one of my questions is does it have to be done all at once? Our initial thought is to start with this location and then move on to everything else. 
 Doing some research, I believe the most future-proof routing protocol would be OSPFv2 (correct me if I'm wrong). Is it going to be a huge headache to connect a 10.0.0.0 to a 192.168.0.0 network? Currently, everything is on 192.168. The biggest reason we want to move to layer 3 is that we have a data center connected to the main location via 2 dark fibers and 1 P2P fiber. Currently, they are separated from each other and the P2P is on a disabled port only to be enabled when the other 2 are down. The 2 dark fibers are redundant but we want to connect that 3rd one to the other 2 dark fibers. We either can't do that or can't figure out how to do that because the 2 dark fibers are 10g and the P2P is 1g.
 Is it feasible to move to layer 3? We have roughly 350 PCs, 100 printers, ~400 phones, 35 switches, and ~100 servers and I'm sure I'm missing more. We are a small team of 4 that does it all, Only 2 of us do the networking I would not call us experts by any means but we make it work. Any problems I didn't think of please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! Quick context. The company I work at NEVER deletes anything from AD. From disabled accounts to old computers/servers, they just disable them and let them be (they been doing this for like 10+ years).
 A couple months ago we started a project to clean everything and we still havent found a way to safely delete every disabled user/system (they never do it especially cause they hire a lot of consultants and a lot of them come and go and they just enable/disable their users).
 Pretty cool thing I just discovered (mind I have 0 exp on the area Im literally new on the job) is that you can export/import users. So I thought about exporting them, storage them in any fileserver and delete them from AD. If we ever decide to use them again we just import them with their groups and stuff like they where when we disabled it. Would this work?. 
 Another suggestion we had was to make "parallel OUs" and storage every disabled/thing in the same OU with some kind of designated name like "Logistic Users - Disabled" or something like that. But this would still invovle having EVERY disabled thing still there.
 ​
 What do you guys do to keep AD clean?.
 Is there any tool to keep track of disabled/enabled users? I just use powershell for everything but Im sure theres a more efficient way.

 Received a ticket today from one of our Support team that their account keeps getting locked out. OK, No biggie.
 Check the lockouts and I see that its happening all over the company???
 Major security issue?
 Long Story short: Support Engineer has been mapping drives for users using HIS account. Changed his password last night and has been locking out.
 I was able to get a list of most of the machines that are locking out. I'll keep an eye on it to gather more. I spoke with his manager about it and we are going to treat this one as a learning experience.

 Almost every hotel has absolutely crummy internet, and I'm trying to avoid that.
 What are your recommendations for routers and router setups to accommodate this many devices?
 This is pretty key. Is there a way to set it up where the available bandwidth is divided up by password? For example I give someone a code they can use to sign into with as many devices as they like, but the total bandwidth allotted to that password would be something like 1MBps?
 Unfortunately the internet service is Frontier, I don't think that's optional.
  
Thank you in advance for any advice, I'm fairly tech savvy but networking is out of my wheelhouse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to configure route-tag on our Nexus 7K's to nip some routing loops in the bud where we do mutual re-distribution between OSPF and BGP. I have the following configured.
 route-map multipod-bgp>ospf deny 10 match tag 100 route-map multipod-bgp>ospf permit 20 set tag 200 ! route-map multipod-ospf>bgp deny 10 match tag 200 route-map multipod-ospf>bgp permit 20 set tag 100 ! router ospf 1 vrf overlay-1 router-id 10.30.19.12 redistribute bgp 65500 route-map multipod-bgp>ospf log-adjacency-changes ! router bgp 65500 vrf overlay-1 address-family ipv4 unicast redistribute direct route-map multipod-route-map redistribute ospf 1 route-map multipod-ospf>bgp 
 Now I do this for EIGRP/BGP as well, and on EIGRP L3 interfaces I also apply tags using an inbound distribute-list with the same route-map with the following syntax:
  ip distribute-list eigrp vrf-A route-map eigrp>bgp in 
 Now the question is how do I configure this same thing for an OSPF L3 interface? The commands are not the same as eigrp and don't really seem to have an analog and I can't seem to figure out how to apply a distribute-list to an OSPF L3 interface.

 Don't need POE, we have some POE switches as we had some Cisco Phones. Did away with those.
 Don't need managed or stackable. We are not managing these switches at all. It's a small shop BUT I will probably get managed anyway if they offer better performance?

 So I am comparing the CBS220 vs CBS250 vs CBS350 series. What is the main difference between these, anybody? TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 since starting networking, I was looking for a tool to create a interactive network diagram.
 Basically the "main goal" is, to have a interactive world map with all network locations and datacenter (including the connections to each other). What I mean by interactive is, that you can hover over a country or location and see the most important information as well as being able to "drill down" by double clicking it.
 I know it is a lot, but and I tried several solutions over the years and found not a single one to create such a "diagram"
 - Visio - Great for detailed Branch Network documentations, but not intereactive
 - Miro - Interactive and easy to use for "quick and dirty" schematics
 - draw.io - same as Miro
 - powerpoint - Interactive but not really meant for network diagrams
 - lucidcharts - same as visio
 - NetBrain - expensive, kinda hard to master and not "easy to use"
 - Any other SDN tool (solarwinds, n-map, ...) same as netbrain
 - even tried some tools for scientific network maps - They basically do what I need but just to a certain degree
 - .....
 As you might notice I've tried a lot and might even have missed some things i tested in the past.
 Maybe one of you big brains out there has something in mind or created something similar in the past.
 I am looking forward for any tips, hints and suggestions :)

 I'm looking for a 1U switch for a datacenter rack with the following requirements.
  
2 x SFP+ or faster fibre for link to meet-me-room
 24 x 1G RJ45
 Managed L2 switch
 Redundant power supply
 Doesn't block with various frame sizes at 60%+ saturation
 Budget max ~2k Euro
 Max 200W power usage (No PoE needed)
  
I have looked into Mikrotik CRS354-48G-4S+2Q+RM, but from the Servethehome performance review mentioned one should buy a different switch if used at higher saturation. Also some comments about Ubiquiti USW-EnterpriseXG-24 and FS S5850-24XMG, though these are 10G L3 switches, so much more than required for my use case. So should be OK?
 Any model or brand you would recommend instead? I saw HP Aruba instant on, but they don't have a redundant PSU except for the CX line. Arista or Brocade?

 All my life i tried to mantain my network, cables and devices all working under the same pattern (usually 568A) and only when needed to,use a crossover cable. In my current adventure, i have little resources and a doubt.
 I have in my hands:
 A rack filled with T568B "Male" Rj-45 cat5e cables.
 A nice furukawa patch-panel.
 Tons of T568A cat5e patch cords of the size i need.
 My doubt: If i crimp the male cables INTO the (female) patch panel at the same pattern as the other end, that is, T568B, then connect the patch cable to my switch through the T568A patch cord... Would i be limiting the internet to 100mb or would it still distribute GBe? Would it even work properly?
 If that wouldn't work... Any suggestions on working it around? would crimping the cables into the patch panel as T568A - same as patch cord - even though the other end is 568B, be better?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't even know if this is a rant, question, quiet quitting, or maybe frustration or all of the above.
 ​
 I have been in IT for 20+ years and this is not my first merger and acquisition, so I know it can be done the correct way. The owners of the 3000+ people company I work for bought three small companies (around 60 people total) about a month ago and want to merge those companies into one new company (our company will operate independently) with a new domain, Azure tenant, email, etc. IT was not involved in any of the initial discussions until the deal closed. We were told to drop everything and focus on this project but as other teams complain up the chain, the drop everything and focus on the merger goes out the window.
 ​
 This project needs to get done by December 31st and there's no leeway on that time. We talked to some consulting companies and even they say getting it done by end of the year, especially with the US holidays is not possible. We have also been told that if this doesn't get done by end of the year, we may all be looking for new jobs. Oh, did I mention that we still do not have any access to the other companies yet to even start any migration, IT from the other companies are dragging their feet with this information.
 ​
 I guess this is where the rant/frustration comes in, but with a message like that from our management and a timeline that does not seem achievable by companies that dedicate their business to mergers (consultants), I don't get what chance our small and understaffed team of IT people have at getting this done by end of the year. What's the point of doing any work for the remainder of the year... I don't know, just frustrated I guess....Open to hearing other people's thoughts and opinions.

I am so sad that I never came across this until now! It does a lot of stuff that I have separate apps for like always on top, Awake, color picker, etc... From what I have seen, these are features that sometimes get baked into Windows, as defaults... And it's amazing! The PowerToys Run tool is a game changer for me on Windows....

 It was all just a moment of panic. The user had OneDrive sync, but didnt check off desktop, so when I log on the OneDrive the desktop didnt sync. So that's why I kinda paniced.

 - Antivirus software Installed / enabled
 - Bitlocker enabled
 - Screensaver set to 15 minutes + Lock workstation
 - Automatic updates enabled
 Is there a script or app that could easily verify all this in 1 go? Powershell? Fairly ignorant about scripting in general. If I had to do more than 50 computers, my first thought would be to hire someone to write a small app that reads the relevant registry settings to then report true or false on each setting.
 Again, these are not company owned machines and have no Active Directory or anything of the sort. Continual monitoring of weather these settings stay as they are in the future is not currently required.
 There may be appetite for a similar script for Mac users, but ... 1 thing at at time.
 I suppose I could aim for a slightly higher level of sophistication, where the app would capture some fingerprints like the date, computer name, and Mac address etc to keep as evidence of compliance.

 We have a web proxy running for web filtering and it uses the user's credentials to authenticate via the Web Filter. But for this to happen the session has to do a HTTP request on a web browser that is using the proxy.
 We use MS Edge as the default browser. 
 Does anyone know of a way that I can automatically do a HTTP request when the user logs in via MS Edge so when they open the browser the session will already be authenticated?
 Problem we have is most sites these days are HTTPS, and for the web filter to authenticate it must be a http site. 
 Any workaround anyone has would be great to hear of.

 I have been asked to look again into delaying all emails by 2 mins, so that any errors can be rectified by dragging the item back out of the outbox. 
 I see that this can be easily done per user via a simple Outlook rule in the rules wizard. But can this be acheived across the firm somehow? Maybe something implemented in a transport policy in Exchange Online?
 I am hoping someone has implemented this before and has it working , so they can tell me what they are using and how it was implemented. 
 Many thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New sysadmin here,
 My current job is making a redundant NPS server to login to the WIFI.
 The current NPS server also functions as the root CA that enables trust for the clients. Because of a problem with our network, we are unable to chain this CA to a publicly trusted CA. Meaning users need to accept our CA as trusted when first logging into our network.
 My boss said that I should make the new server a root CA as well. However, this would mean devices would also need to accept this new CA as trusted. This could cause confusion amongst users, why I am not keen on the solution.
 My idea is as follows:
  
Copy all NPS settings to the new server.
 Make this new server a subordinate CA, chaining it to the already existing root CA.
  
I have two questions regarding this setup:
  
Will this make it so devices only need to accept a certificate once?
 What happens when the existing (root CA) is down, will the trust in the subordinate CA keep persisting?
  
I am still a bit of a noob when it comes to NPS and certificates, so any help would be appreciated!

 We are replacing the 4 drives with bigger ones and we are wondering which is better to do:
  
Extend the mdadm raid5 partitions on the disk (in order to occupy the free space of each new disk) and then grow, in order: mdadm RAID5 -> PV -> VG.
 Create 4 new partitions on the unused space of the new disks, create a new raid5 array from them, add the new mdamd array as PV and extend the VG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm transitioning into IT at 35 after working in education the last 10 years. I consider myself reasonably intelligent and have been working rather successfully towards industry certifications. Now, as many of you rightly point out, certifications don't equal experience. All they serve to do is fill gaps in my theory, such as being unaware of how networking works until studying OSI model, TCP, etc.
 So the question then becomes, how do I learn how to do things right? Many folks on here talk about homelabbing, and I'm slowly but surely spinning up things with Azure credits and Raspberri Pis, but at the end of the day, all of my work relies on internet research. If some yahoo on StackOverflow says to set it up one way or another, there's little I can do to verify that this is a conceptually sound process, because I lack the experience - I don't know what I don't know.
 Of course, many people would next say 'get the experience.' But how can one do that if one does not have the experience to get the job in the first place? That is to say, my goal is working my way into systems administration. In such a job they might want me to produce an effective backup storage solution, but if my knowledge comes from tainted sources, how can I do this? It seems like so, so many organizations are running with these barebones IT teams where there's really limited opportunity to start as a junior admin and learn under them over time.

 I have a client who has 2 machines with an underlying Windows XP OS. Users in the Office put files in the machines through network share. 
 Found out the connection they use is SMBv1, which is a security risk.
 I have been tasked to find a solution for it.
 First of all they can upgrade their system to the latest OS but its going to cost them a lot, which they'd like to avoid. They also like to avoid using USB Sticks and keep walking from the Office to the machines.
 I thought of using a NAS(Network Attached Storage) but I don't think this is going to work because the NAS needs to place files in the machine, which I have no clue how to do that, or is this even possible.
 Second, the machines don't need access to the internet at all. I preferably like to isolate the machines from the internal network, which can be done with a NAS.
 Finally, disable access to the internet on the machines and leave it as it is, which is not secure.
 Any idea's how to solve this?

 The idea is to put a Dream Machine at the top of the network, connected directly to a UniFi aggregate switch, and then connect that to the rest of the switches in the network.
 The plan is to have two 48 port switches in the same rack as the the aggregate switch and dream machine. The question is, does it make more sense to connect each 48 port in the same “stack” directly to the aggregate switch, or would it be better to daisy chain the two switches. Or does it not matter at all.
 Not really too important but couldn’t find much advice about this online and wanted to try to keep things clean and easy. Thanks for your help!

 We got SNMP working no problem, but we rather avoid that. When the SNMP traffic comes across our diode all the traffic appears to come from it. We would need to modify communication strings to know what came from where which is a no go. We already use WUG, but they only offer bi-directional TCP connections between two servers. 
 For something to work we would need a server on the inside to pass across the diode to the outside with one-way TCP communication or UDP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a 1-person IT department for a small rural school district for the past decade. My title is “IT Director” but that seems little grandiose for what I do. But I do it all… inventory, imaging, network, budgeting/purchasing, monitoring, security, planning, pulling cable, cameras, repairs, Google admin, A/V, backups… The only thing I don’t do is copier repair. 
 I’m planning on moving back to an urban/suburban area soon and I’d like to be a part of a larger IT dept but I don’t know what kind of a role to look for. I have major imposter syndrome and can’t figure out if I’m over or under valuing my abilities. It also seems like a lot has changed in the past decade. Hell, when I started my current position, the building didn’t have full WiFi coverage and most teachers still used overhead projectors with markers. Now every student has a laptop. Ideally, I’d like to stay in education but just something where there’s more than just me and my thoughts all day working together. 
 I’m just wondering if anyone else has made a similar move and what your experience was like. 
 Also, is the “director” title a liability on a resume?

When attempting to RDP to the server, I get a response that "Your credentials did not work". I have tried both my username and the Administrator as well. Both give me the same response. If I RDP into a different machine, then RDP into the server I am able to access it with no issues using either my credentials or the Administrator credentials. 
 Has anybody come across something like this? I can't for the life of me figure out why this is happening.

 certbot certonly -d domain.com -d *.domain.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --preferred-chain "ISRG Root X1"
 But when I use this command, "openssl verify" cannot confirm the validity of the cert, even though certbot reads the sub-domain TXT records, and issues cert contents that it reports is valid:
 certbot certonly -d sub.domain.com -d *.sub.domain.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --preferred-chain "ISRG Root X1"
 What the hell am I doing wrong? And no, I'm not interested in changing my workflow, certbot is not-optional to switch away from at this time, and yes I need to do TXT manual entries for reasons I do not want to go into.
 If I could please get help pointing out why this somehow doesn't work, because it should... the error outputted when failing is:
 CN = sub.domain.com error 20 at 0 depth lookup: unable to get local issuer certificate error fullchain.pem: verification failed
 (it says the same thing with cert.pem)
 Naturally I have obfuscated the domain for public safety.
 Any help is appreciated! Thanks! :D

 I am looking for a solution to have 2 sites connected 24/7 via voice communication. It means to say that there is no need for dialing and the users could just speak over the system and the other site would be able to hear it. I have 2 sites that needs this real time communication system for ease of operations.
 Do you know what’s out there that can do this?
 I looked at those IP phones but I am assuming that dialing and picking up is needed.
 Edited: I do have VPN connected between these two sites so I am assuming the only thing we need to figure out is the system that allows this to work.

 We have a few ESSENTIAL pieces of software (MelcoUI, RDWorks - to name a few) that trigger a UAC prompt just to launch the application. Obviously I don't want to give the admin passwords to users just so they can use the software that they need to do their jobs - that negates the whole point of giving them least privileges. And obviously I dont want employees using admin profiles either due to security concerns. 
 My question is: Is there way to disable UAC for these pieces of software so they can launch them from a standard user profile without having to input an admin password?
 Any suggestions on how to go about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We use Android tablets for our WMS in a warehouse-like place. This place has some kind of 1st floor made with a steel structure on top of the ground floor (a lovely location to play with Wifi).
 Tablets have always had issues with Wifi connection dropping.
 In order to improve the situation, we've added somes more APs, changed channels. It did help a bit but issues haven't disappeared.
 Recently, we tested some new tablets (for other reasons), and these one's had less issues when roaming.
 After some more research i've heard about Rate settings and decided to give it a shot and made a great mistake : pushing the changes to prod before even testing...
 The major changes were made by our service provider after i asked what they thought of it.
 After a ton of user complaints (tablets were almost always dis/re-connecting), i rolled back to the previous rates settings (had screenshot of it). Even though situation has improved, it is still worse than before the changes.
 I've switched back to 2.4GHz only the APs on the warehouse side, rates are the same as before.
 All tablets models are impacted : CrossCall T4 (Android 10), Samsung A8 and S6 lite (Android 12), our APs are exclusively Aerohive ap130.
 Now my back is against the wall as i don't see what could be causing this... 
 Any help is welcome

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a custom Database frontend that appears to be hardcoded to the SQL server's IP address. I tested this by modifying my host file for the SQL servers hostname to point to 127.0.0.2 and I could still log into the frontend of the app and pull up data. Next I set the Windows Firewall to block all outgoing connection to the SQL servers IP address and I couldn't log into the app.
 I want to migrate the backend database to a modern SQL server (and test the frontend client to ensure it still works) but other than installing a second vNIC on the new SQL server with the old servers IP address (which is an option), is there a way to modify the frontend?
 I'm not a programmer. I think it was created in Studio for NET 2004. 
 Edit: I just opened a login.vb file and found a reference to the server's IP address. If I change it...how do I...compile the application? Seriously I know nothing. Ideally this would point to a server name so I can create a DNS entry.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From a corp FW perspective, do you see reason NOT to explicitly allow all of 443/udp outbound, generally speaking?
 I'm learning about QUIC because it is apparently used as part of M365 for some of the OneDrive/SP stuff, and I created a rule to allow it as per MSFT's docs, however the more I read the more I realize lots of things use it, and it's pretty secure.
 I feel like I could create a better user experience in general for Google/MSFT/Anything in the future that uses QUIC, by allowing UDP/443 outbound indiscriminately, but of course from a gut-feeling perspective, it feels inappropriate to do so.
 What have some of you done? Are you specifying destination criteria / keeping up with new domains/CIDRs for this or are you allowing it outbound to anything?

 If you ctrl+f this blog for "Deflecting Reflection" it appears you could be DoS'ed, perhaps something to consider.

 One of those is Allied Telesis - They have a minuscule, and I do mean EXTREMELY tiny presence in our country as they have only entered our market, but the downside of that is that I have no idea how good or bad their products are, and I'm not going to suggest a product to my client without knowing that it's good and reliable, regardless of how cheap it may be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Example Network Topology
 Please see my network topology sketch. How would you join Special System A and Special System B with a common Layer 2 domain? I have a routed network, but these devices must have transparent layer 2 connectivity between them?
 If I have a Cisco 3850, Cisco 9300, and a Cisco 3650 in a triangle of routing, can I use a technology, such as VXLAN to span a VLAN across these? Do these platforms support this?
 What if I have a more complex network? Does each switch in the routing path need to be VXLAN supporting, or only the ingress/egress switches?
 Is there a performance consideration doing this, or should the switches be able to handle this traffic at or near line-speed?
 Is there a better way? I have no experience on VXLAN, outside of reading about it.
 ​
 There are two use-cases for this. One is for the above diagram, where I have a special system that must have layer two connectivity. Furthermore, if this works, there will be more than two endpoints, and I would need to provide a common Layer 2 spanning several locations. The bandwidth requirements are low. <10Mbps
 The second use case is to create a form of hyper segmentation, for security. I'd like to be able to span several VLANs out to certain sites for IOT, guest access, surveillance cameras, etc. All running back to a central firewall, or series of ACLs would control access between the segments. In this network, all the sites are connected by at 1-10 GbE fiber.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm the "tech-guy" for a small startup. We use Microsoft 365 for all our email needs. We average about 15 outgoing emails a day and about 60 inward. We're small, we don't send bulk email, it's just not appropriate for our customer base. We had SPF configured, and that was working well (i.e. we didn't notice it not-working).
 Last week we started getting "550 5.7.1" errors from any emails sent to a google hosted domain.
 I'm going through the advice on Google's support pages and it's all targeted at bulk-senders and so on. We have a 100% "Bad" reputation for our IPs (from November 2) and a "Bad" reputation for the Domain since August. I suspect this is due to some entries in our SPF entry which includes a slightly dodgy hosting company. We use an external ERM tool which is hosted there and I added their IP ranges to the SPF. Since then the email config has changed and it's not required to add their IPs to my SPF.
 On Friday I removed all the SPF records bar the microsoft one and I set up DKIM and DMARC.
 I'm getting green lights on all the DMARC dashboards for our DNS setup. I can see email headers are containing all the good stuff and I am receiving reports from recipient servers with confirmation that my DMARC is good.
 But, we're still not able to send to any google hosted domains. What further steps can I take to heal my domain's reputation, and how can I get some more warning on this in future?

 Through windows I can click on "add port", and assign it manually. My problem, however, is being able to do it through a special script that changes this option for me.
 I investigated through Prnmngr, Prnport, cscript. But I can't find a way to automate this field switch.
 Powershell for internal policy is not possible to do this.

 so i've 2 problems
 1st is migrate all the VM(including the pfSense..) (and all possible newtork configuration) to a new dual controller storage, better a Synology because i've already another Synology only for backup with 'Active backup for business' but its just for safe, the VMs Run on the this old Netapp)
 2nd Chose a new one, UC3200 is great but expensive, maybe an little oldest one?

 Admin at a small private school, 2 campuses each with about 300 students.
 We've got a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro on each campus, but it seems like we're operating at capacity.
 Ubiquiti recommends up to 40 devices (network devices, not clients) on each UDM pro, and we've got 45 on each.
 This seems to put a strain on the UDM-pros, since the CPU is always operating at 90-100% and the GUI-based portion of the OS frequently crashes, and we have to restart the unifi services via SSH in order to get back in.
 Anyone have any recommendations on how to go about replacing the UDM-pros with something that can handle the load better, and have that recommended 20% headroom?

 I always thought the default IPSEC lifetime was 3600 seconds aka 1 hour.. Now looking at a Cisco Firepower Management Center, the default lifetime under the IPSEC section of a Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel says "Tunnel Duration: 28800 Seconds" 
 Google shows mixed results, some people say the default timer on ASA, and IOS Routers are 3600, while others say it's the same as on the FMC.. 
 Does anyone know why the default IPSEC Lifetime is 28800 and not 3600 and whether different Cisco products have different default lifetimes? And can you get the IPSEC Tunnel up if both ends have different lifetimes? I know Phase 1 (ISAKMP) can negotiate the tunnel with lifetime mismatch, in that case, the lowest lifetime is used, but is it the same for IPSEC?

 I have a problem with the remote access to a terminal server.
 I gave the remote-permission on our TS to a user from our domain like I did with the last for users (where the connection works). But it does not work with one specific user. This user has the same rights and is linked with the same GPOs as the other four.
 When I connect with the TS I get the error that the user has no permission for a remote-login... Has anyone an idea what the problem could be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 we're having a standard setup:
  
syncing AD with AAD Connect to the cloud
 Exchange Hybrid with Exchange 2016
  
We're having a subset of users, who are external suppliers and have their external SMTP adresses added to their AD account, as an Exchange contact object; they don't have a mailbox.
 Background for this is, that we have Apps like Jira and Confluence, where those suppliers should receive updates for Tickes/Sites on their primary work address. Those apps source the SMTP Adress from the AD mail property. I really don't like this setup, but that's something grown.
 However, this is making some trouble with syncing to the cloud, since those SMTP adresses are already registerd with the tenant of the supplier, which makes absolutely sense. But we need those accounts synced to AAD, because we're using AAD as Identity Provider (IdP) for several apps.
 Qeustion to the community?
 How have you solved a challenge like this?
 From my point (Exchage/AD) I can only imagine a solution with Exchange mailboxes for those users with a forwarding to their primary work address. But thils will cost a license in the future, when we move those mailboxes to Exchange Online. That's something I want to avoid.
 My preferred solution would be, that such users can set a notification address in the application. But I don't know if this possible.
 Thanks for helping!

 We are running Hybrid Exchange, so to my knowledge to create an inactive mailbox, this is the process:
  
Move the user account to an OU that is not synced to Azure AD while the account is licensed in O365.
 This will cause the account to be deleted in Azure AD while licensed. The license then goes back into the pool and the mailbox is converted to inactive mailbox.
 We can then disable the user account in On-Prem AD and then delete it later on.
  
Retention Policy has been setup in Microsoft Purview to retain items indefinitely.
 My questions are:
  
If you remove the license then delete/unsync the account from Azure AD, will it still create inactive mailbox?
 We used to convert user accounts to shared mailboxes so we have disabled users objects in our Active Directory. If we delete these disabled users or unsync the disabled objects from Azure AD, will the shared mailboxes become inactive mailbox or will it purge the Shared Mailbox instead?

 For convince I put up a new server on last Sunday, and the disks were iscsi mounted from our NAS.
 NAS is running TRUENAS SCALE and has a hardware uptime of 200 days which is when we installed it in our colo.
 Scheduled to replace disks in the old node Wednesday, and then to move the oracle server back to said node Sunday, meaning today.
 Yesterday, Saturday, at 09.45 the NAS PSU just flat out died. The entire thing (It's a redundant one with two separate power connections) just poof.
 And since it was only for one week, guess who didn't make the iscsi connection redundant and make it also live on another of our TRUENAS instances?
 Yup me. The proud moron that had to spend Saturday to call colo tech to let me in, grab the NAS, drive in to the office and replace the psu, so we could power the NAS back on and get our ERP up.
 Even if it's temporary, do it right from the get go. Don't be a fucking idiot like I am.
 Anyway, just finished migrating the oracle back to it's old node with new disks. Time to walk my dog.

I ask because a lot of posts show problems with the platform/solution, and I wonder about the long term viability of the product. I think the firepower/asa branding has suffered over the past years because of issues with firepower, and I wonder if the same will happen to ACI, or has already happened?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If a company asks for help after treating an ex-employee badly, the common advice here is to consult at a high rate.
 This is terrible advice, please stop giving it.
 As a consultant they're opening themselves up personally to liability and lawsuits by their former company. Especially if they were treated poorly when they worked there, the company isn't going to think twice about it.
 Professional consultants carry liability insurance and have a company or LLC shielding their personal assets from any litigation.
 Making a bit of quick money and screwing your former company isn't worth the risk of losing all you have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there any known PoE issues with the HP ProCurve 2910al-24G-PoE+ (J9146A)?
 For several months, I've had 5 Reolink PoE cameras connected to a refurbished 2910al-24G-PoE+, and all of them went offline over the past couple weeks. The switch currently says it is delivering 3-4W PoE to all cameras, but the port lights only turn on for 1-2. In all cases, neither IP or link-layer pings can reach them.
 The switch is also delivering PoE to two Wifi APs and an unmanaged PoE-in 5-port switch. These three things have continued to function fine, with the Wifi APs being online even longer than the cameras.
 Also, the cables have been tested and verified. They are shielded CAT6 with solid 23 AWG copper wire. Should hold up just fine.
 Back to the cameras, I can't seem to get the online. There are 4 different models, all from Reolink, and only the oldest one (out of support) lights up a network port. I've also tried them on a ProCurve 2520-8 (J9137A), and it's the nearly the same problem, except that one old camera gets CRC/alignment errors showing up in the switch logs for it's port. Doesn't matter which port I connect it to.
 The only explanation I can think of, and it doesn't make complete sense to me, is that somehow a power outage bricked the PoE Reolink cameras, but not the other PoE devices, and not the PoE switch itself. Perhaps Reolink PoE products are less resilient? Is that plausible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s say an existing site (A) is configured with 172.16.0.0/16 network, for a total of 100 hosts in service currently. 10 of these 100 devices are switches. 
 This is a completely private Switched network for now with no routers available. 
 I need to establish management access to only these 10 switches, from an existing Server having an address of 192.168.0.100/24 at Site (B). 
 (The switch management addresses I want to manage at site (A) are in sequence - 172.16.1.100 to 172.16.1.109).
 My plan was to use a new NIC available at the server with the address 172.16.1.99 and /28 mask, together with a static route in the server pointing to this NIC as the gateway for the /28 network. 
 Subnet mask of the 10 switches at Site (A) would be changed to /28 and a Gateway address of 172.16.1.99 would be added to them as well. 
 My feeling is this isn’t a clean solution, but since I’m not allowed to change the addresses of the switches at site (A), this is the only way I could think of doing it. Does it make sense at all?

The new vlan 50 (ip address: 172.50.1.2) has been configured, ip helper set to the Mitel controller at 172.50.0.2. LLDP has been enabled. I have tagged port 17 with vlan 50 and untagged 1o which is the data network. When I plug in a phone it is unable to pick up DHCP. When I plug a laptop into the back of the phone, I am getting the 50 vlan and an IP. Did I misconfigure something here?

My method for deleting the tacacs configuration was to first remove all aaa commands and last “no aaa new-model”. In one of the switches, I accidentally removed all commands except one: “Aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+”. I configured login local for all vty lines and console, but now I’m afraid to configure aaa with Duo. (I had a bad experience with one switch in the past - couldn’t access it when I was trying to configure new aaa config because it remembered all old aaa commands - didn’t remove them at that time). Experienced people, what should I do?

 Signal metrics both LTE and 5G (of course 5G differs with how it measures SINR for example): RSSI RSRQ RSRP SINR
 Example: running a speed test on the cellular router may show great throughput, decent latency/jitter, but the SINR is poor and fluctuating heavily (up and down vs a solid line). This then seems to result in a bad user experience.
 Teams seem more interested in the speed test results vs breaking down the signal metrics into usable user experience values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a week ago Friday I gave my two weeks notice after finding a new, better position. I decided to leave this job due to being the only on site IT resource, which required 7 day weeks with 10 hours on site and the rest on-call from Black Friday through New Years Eve without receiving any extra pay during those times. In addition this company treats IT needs with extremely low priority until an outage stops production, and kept moving my office anytime someone decided they wanted that space (currently I am in a mice-infested storage closet). 
 I found out late last week that they will not be able to hire a replacement for me until after the new year aside from a weekend temp that has almost no IT experience (weekday needs will be covered remotely by the already-stretched-thin corporate office). This is likely to mean outages that will cause them to miss SLAs and put an already threatened facility perilously close to being shut down. 
 Should I feel guilty about this? I’m getting lots of guilt trips but find myself not really giving a crap. 
 My wife suggested offering to do consultant work for them on my off hours, but called me an asshole for saying that I wouldn’t even think about it for less than $250 an hour.
 Edit: For those questioning if the office moves were real, here are some photos (censored so I don’t dox myself): https://imgur.com/a/CnPwoiu/

securely removing company data from the devices
 reimaging with a usable copy of Windows
  
We were thinking Blancco for the data wipe. Anyone use this or have alternate suggestions?
 Also, is anyone aware of free educational or charity licensing from Microsoft? Not sure how to provide a legally licensed copy of Win10 on these devices as they will no longer run our corporate image.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am looking to wire my Small Business with 10GBe (Future proof) and need PoE for roughly 7 cameras and 7 Wi-Fi Access Points). L3 is required for security and Vlan routing. I was thinking to go Unifi which I have experience with, but then stumbled on this FS S5850-24XMG-U Switch. This switch has 24 copper PoE++ ports and is L3.
 The Unifi switches would cost nearly as much and require several switches, where this looks to be all in one and maybe a better option.
 However, I do not have any experience with FS and there are no spec sheets available for this. I hope a few people here have some experience with this switch.
  
 How loud is it compared to Unifi Switches?
 
 Does it offer a web based GUI management or is all done via CLI (I have no CLI experience)?
  Would there be any other options or what would you recommend for my use case (12 - 14 POE devices, 5 additional rooms, 10GB, NAS and 2 PCs with Wired connections, VLANS and PFSense firewall).

 It seems fairly quiet on here around Kerberos issues and I'm not sure if that's because people have installed the Nov patch and it's fine, or installed the Nov patch and the OOB patch and it's fine, or if everyone has just backed the hell off patching their DCs and is waiting and hoping it gets sorted out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote this in another post but figure it should be here.
 When I first got started in IT I was doing data reconciliation work for a major semi conductor industry. The job could have been automated but the guy running that division ( a completely different one ) did not want to agree to take on task of data modeling every issue out to be resolved. 
 I'm very gifted and could do it all in a 2 hours but was groomed to stretch it out because it would mean the next guy had impossible metrics. I had an entire blockbusters worth of movies in my cubical and started coming in at 6 pm working till 2 am to put 8 hours in no one would see was just watching movies for 6 hours. 
 Then I got into a feud with an upstream division that logged everything on Friday at 4pm meaning I couldn't go to the bars to drink with my highschool friends. I complained once and they said they would stop, the next week they slammed me with double so I just signed off and went to the bar. 
 Over 5 million dollars got misplaced because I didn't file the work and it raised holy hell with the C execs. I walked into a strong arm meeting where they tried putting me on the fire and just said "I quit" right away and suddenly they were my best friends and asking me what I'd want from a fulltime job. 
 I said nothing and trained my poor replacement who was an average joe family man and he literally cried as I walked out the door. Felt bad but I had a strong edge on my shoulder since I was kid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Our small organization has been archiving media content with our own tape library as a standard practice for some time solely dedicated to our ingest/post-production footage, now we are expanding tape backup writing for other non-critical departments.
 The other departments have had a few TBs backed up in their "unlimited" (Google) cloud storage using our corporate network for a few years, now we need a mechanism to access the content in the cloud and download them to an on-premise storage machine with access to writing to the tape library. Additionally, a checksum validation of the files should be done after writing to tape. 
 So far we expect existing content to be around 12-15TB for the newly included department, the data is expected to grow to maybe 20-25% per year. This content will need to be stored for 8 years for data compliance, and we cannot maintain a single (cloud) copy for their department, hence writing to tape is a hard requirement here. 
 What we have so far as a current setup is, 
  
Mac machine with an in-built storage of maybe 500GB free space currently.
 Access to the cloud content via the desktop application (Google Drive).
 Standalone tape writer with connectivity to the mac via thunderbolt 2 (We don't have the infra for a windows system to connect to standalone tape writer as of now)
 Rewritable LTO-7 Tapes @ 15TB capacity
  
Full disclosure, on our side of IT we have not been looking into the tape writing side until this requirement came up. On a high level, this new project seems to be very tedious as the backup will be of many individual objects, and not sure whether an MD5 checksum for a list of files contained in a folder using the mac terminal is possible, or if somebody can suggest a safe third-party software app. 
 Would like to know what will be the best approach here? Is using the mac as the storage medium the best option also? We don't plan on investing in external hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 Back Story is I am somewhat of a novice as it comes to advanced networking.... I have successfully set up OPNSense, a Brocade 6450, and a Ruckus r710 running the latest Unleashed firmware. My main SSID is set up on the AP and is running perfectly fine. My issue is when I got to setup a second SSID for IoT on my r710. 
 Similar to PFSense, I have configured my router with a Vlan, different subnet of 10.0.10.0/24, DHCP server, etc.... The vlan is tagged as 10 on OPNSense. I have done the same on the R710.... I created a guest network, under WLAN set the VLAN to 10. 
 Then on the brocade, I created a vlan and set the port 48 to dual mode so that the tagged vlan 10 and the untagged traffic should be able to flow, but that hasn't worked. I even tried to assign the subnet IP to the tagged vlan 10 with no change. 
 The only thing that has worked so far somewhat is when I set the Vlan tag to 1 in the Guest SSID on the ruckus, but that similar then routes traffic through the untagged rule on the switch which does not achieve the true separation I want for my Vlan. 
 What am I missing here? Any help or direction would be helpful! I have been reading documentation for several hours now, but I am no where closer to solving my problem. Am I missing something simple or am I WAY off base on my understanding of how things needs to flow? Cheers

Anyway, I only recovered really fast because backing up the virtual machine disks is as simple as creating a snapshot or archive file of the whole disk and tossing it onto a longer term storage. About as easy as backing up a file from your documents IMO.
 How do you do physical drive / server backups? How do you backup hard drives and SSDs without taking them out of the server and cloning? I'm curious because that's one of the bigger empty spots in our documentation.

 I’m the sole IT staff for a multimillion dollar grant program wrapped under a major non-profit. Essentially I have a dotted line to IT, but other than back end things like HR and email, I am responsible for everything else. I’ve been doing it for over a decade so in some sense I don’t have imposter syndrome directly in the role, but at the same time I don’t have deep professional IT experience, and just get by on my own. I leverage a consultant for engineering and largely perform systems administration and support in addition to my others roles. I’m lacking in best practices, oversight and auditing, and ultimately feel like an amateur due to no one requiring anything from me other than “are things working?” 
 I’ve managed fine, overseeing and supporting 9 physical offices, virtual infrastructure and workforce etc, but I feel like I can’t get another job because I’ve largely done everything on my own with little direction and just keeping everything working with the bare minimum. 
 How can I prepare myself for a potential job within an actual IT department with IT professionals that likely have more knowledge than me? And how do I accomplish that without going backwards? I’ve leveraged myself into a senior leadership position within the org beyond just IT, with a heavy emphasis on operational project management and strategic planning (non-IT). 
 Ultimately I don’t feel like I have the skills I need to be successful and I don’t want to be where I am forever. I’m a jack of all trades and an expert of none. 
 Has anyone else been in a similar situation that was able to break through and progress? How did you do it?

 On speedtest I noticed that when I run the download latency it is a normal 20-30, however when its checking for upload speeds, the latency is between 125-1250. Massive spikes happen which is in line with what I am seeing when gaming. I had my father in law test his upload latency just down the street and his upload and download match.
 So I am wondering what could be the cause of the spikes? I haven't added any new devices that would cause more bandwidth to be used. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we manage sites along the retail/hospitality line that have guest wifi. We normally see maybe 1-2 DDOS attacks per year. We do not host any domains, or any services for that matter, that would allow someone to find out the IP's of the sites remotely. Except for a select few, none of the IP's are SWIP'd in arin either.
 So that leads me to be believe someone on the guest wifi at these sites does something to piss someone off on the internet, or its a random/driveby/typo. Typically they are short lived, single incident or maybe two within an evening/day.
 Its almost always in 1hr or 2 hour intervals, which leads me to believe its a DDOS for hire type thing. Always volumetric, so dns/udp/icmp reflection/fragmentation. So since its volumetric and these sites dont have bgp, there isnt anything we can do from our end.
 Most providers arent that helpful, because they want you to pay for their DDOS protection service, which is normally at least 2x+ the MRC of the actual internet service itself.
 Dealing with one now that is lumen/centurylink. Had an event Monday evening, then again last night (didnt notice this as it was 12am) and now this evening again. We stopped using the IP they were hitting, changed the NAT pool to a new IP, but they are still hitting the old IP. To their credit they did do some filtering Monday, but said it was a one time thing and we needed to talk to our account rep. Looking at the bandwidth graph on the lumen portal, looks like it starts out at over 1gbps, but then settles in around 700-800mbps, and we only have 500mbps at the site. Im inclined to just go to 1gbps if im going to throw money at something, but they could just throw more DDOS at it at that point.
 Anyone have any thoughts on this other than it sucks? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote this in another post about a sysadmin having to fire someone for accessing a system they shouldn't have. The sysadmin I worked for had a red flag come up and had to fire someone and was torn up because the guy was a genius and it was right before Christmas holiday break. We drank heavily about it. Then after we came back to the office he had to clean out the guys office and put it into a box and discovered the biggest pile of pornography known to man he had created on thousands of CDs, disks, zip drives. They found the guy had written macros completely automating his job and spent 100% of his time collecting, indexing and catologing porn for absolutely no reason. 
 If I recall right ( I was drunk when told so could be wrong ) the company had to call the police incase anything illegal was on the disks but it was so much they didn't have the time/budget to go through it all. They tried speaking with the guy but he had moved out of state when his building access got locked. 
 In the end the sysadmin got the full fury of the company for not knowing what was going on and the poor admin spent 2-3 months 7 days a week working to create and implement new security processes and traveling to every branch to install them.
 The guy was only caught because one of our female coworkers had been in the adult industry briefly when she was younger and he somehow recognized her ( they said he had a photographic memory ) and accessed the HR database on her home addresse which was monitored by law.
 I will say this for the company. They put the sysadmin through 3 months of hell but once he finished they gave him a promotion and paid vaca.
 Edit: Because people are saying he stalked her. The sysadmin was able to speak with him once via his mother and the guy said he wasn't trying to stalk her only to put her address into the index he made. He was brilliant but OCD about data. That's what made him good at his job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can't find an answer anywhere so hoping you can help. My question is when radio waves are sent from the antenna of my wireless device to the router, how is the binary interpreted in the right order or reconstructed into the right order?
 My understanding is that the radio waves can reach the router out of order due to multi propagation where radio waves can take different paths of different lengths due to reflecting off of objects (which are potentially moving). 
 Also, can someone confirm my understanding is right that only a single device communicates with an access point at a time because of CDMA/CA. This allows the access point to know which device is sending it signals right? I realize in the newer 802.11 ax, it can split a channel into subsections and interpret signals from multiple devices at the same time so does it need CDMA/CA?
 Thanks for the help.

 config.office.com/deploymentsettings
 Exported the configure.xml file and went to the command prompt as administrator and successfully installed Microsoft office 2021.
 When i go to my account settings in office...the program correctly states that its not activated.
 So, I am noticing that Microsoft office launches....i am able to open a word document and edit it. I can save the edited version on my hard drive. All this... even though I have not activated MS office.
 Excuse my ignorance but i find this unusual that I am able to use the program without activating it. Is this like a trial run where the Office program stops working at some point if you do not activate it?

 It's not working on a brand new Server 2022 WSUS server. The page loads, but does not load the way it needs to to import into WSUS. The ActiveX control won't load. 
 Why is it still relying on ActiveX at this point as IE is being retired and not included in Server 2022?
 Either you get an error stating an addon failed to load or no prompt at all and it just doesn't work.
 People in the comments there stating it used to work and then stopped working and nobody is posting a new solution.
 Does anyone have a new fix to make this work? Different URLs to add?
 I used a workaround of installing the WSUS console on an older server that still has full IE11 and imported the update from there. I shouldn't need to do that and eventually those servers will be retired and that will no longer be an option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I recently started working for a decently large company with multiple locations that does absolutely 0 auditing/logging for our Windows PC's. So I got approval from the IT manager to audit all login/logoff/login failure activity and put it in a database.
 So, I turned the auditing GPO's on, however they feel very junky and the login failure logging doesn't even seem to work. Current issues:
 - Someone logs in and event viewer logs it 4 times and than it says the account logged out 3 times, even though all he did was log in once.- Someone fills in bad passwords, but nothing appears in the event viewer even though the GPO's are turned on for auditing/logging this.
 Is there a way to make it more reliable and work? Or is there a better option that I'm unaware of?
 ​
 Edit: I'm just a junior network and sysadmin, they won't even bother listening to me implementing a paid system since I'm very new to the company. I've been working on making a Powershell script that nitpicks and exports the Event Viewer data to the DB and from there on to a Grafana Dashboard. However the audit GPOs are super unreliable, hence my question.

The ceilings are hard capped with spread out access hatches around the building. From my experience there are typically a couple of fire rated walls to work through as well. This site is also about 2 hours from me so I'm factoring travel as well.
 I'm coming to $9,169, or $458.45 per AP. To me this seems high, but I'm thinking it'll take about 60 man hours. These buildings just always seem to be a pain. This also includes a patch panel, 3000' of Cat6, about 100 drive rings, 40 patch cables, 20 keystones and 20 surface mounts for the keystones. The APs will be owner provided.
 Thoughts on this? Thanks!

 We're doing a migration of all our mailboxes from an on-prem 2016 exchange server to 365 using a hybrid setup.
 we've been using the GUI in the exchange online admin centre to create the batches for the mail migrations but I've found them tediously slow.
 To automate things I've read online that you can use powershell to speed things up.
 Unfortunately I can't seem to find the powershell commands for a hybrid migration, but I've come to the conclusion that using the commands for a staged migration would get the same results of going through the GUI.
 The process I would otherwise go through would be:
 EAC > migrations > select "add batch" > give name - pick "migration to exchange online" > select "remote move migration" > select the hybrid endpoint > insert users or csv > pick target …]]></summary>

 1) Enabled WOL in BIOS and windows
 2)Got myselef DDNS from noip and connected to it in router settings (DUC is running and showing connection is on, router menu says connection succesful)
 3) forwarded ports udp 7 in 9
 settings go soemthing like this 
 Ip Lan adress - 192.168.1.74 (target PC ip)
 protocol - udp
 external port - 9 
 port - 9
 Source device Ip adress - 192.168.1.255 ???? no idea what this setting is but guide asked for .1.255 ip and i can only put it here
 WAN interface - IOiE_DHCP
 ​
 Then. I instal wake on lan app on my phone. I am able to wake on lan now (throug wifi).
 Conect to celular. Input Dns adress (.hopto.org) as hostname, mac adress stays the same.
 Whats next? I think i messed up eithier with port forwarding or DDNS setup. Any ideas?

 Hi. we have an application that uses IMAP with basic authentication.
 and we recently switched from Exchange to Office 365 for our email service, 
 this application stopped working because it requires 2FA authentication from office365, which the application does not support.
 Is there software that acts as a proxy or intermediary? For example, fetch emails from Office 365, use 2FA, and our application fetches emails again from this software uses basic authentication.
 is this doable ?

 Currently, we don't require MFA for users who are connecting via the corporate network (we've applied exceptions when users log in when their device is connected to the corporate network). But, now somewhere I read, 'you should require MFA even if you're connecting via the corporate networks'
 After analyzing lots of stuff, most of the answers turned me into a dilemma mode. Having to require multi-factor authentication within corporate networks may be tiresome, but if you don't require MFA while connecting via a corporate network, you won't be able to implement zero trust within your organization.
 What are your opinions on this? What do you do for your Office 365 tenant?

 All the way through that article everything goes as planned until step 12... adding Type NT SERVICE\MSSQL$MICROSOFT##WID and click OK. * 
 I get cannot be found / added or whatever it says, I tried doing the "add everyone reboot, and try again" same error.... So - I started back tracking and removed everyone and left the NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES and am pausing there... Not sure what is going on here. This is a domain joined server and I am just adding a few basic roles.

Problem we’re having though is that there’s a growing amount of “mission critical” tasks being run in individual Power Automate accounts. It’s all well and good if it’s just personal productivity gains like automating some sort of spreadsheet processing but when it’s creating or modifying data that multiple people use we obviously have a problem of not knowing where it originates or what to do when a person vacates. 
 From doing some Googling it seems to be a bit of grey area with Microsoft licensing as to whether it is appropriate to set up what would essentially be a service account managed by IT to run all these Power Automate tasks and allowing users access to it. Has anyone else managed to solve the issue in their environment of centralizing Power Automate?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm looking for advice on configuration for a second ISP uplink on a layer 2 switch with Fortigates in an HA Active/Passive config. The ISP is utilizing VARP on their end. From what I've read, I believe I need to set up a LACP on my HP switch, and then VRRP on my Fortigate. I've included a basic diagram if anyone is willing to look at let me know if I'm on the right track. Devices in blue are managed by me, green by other entities.
 I know that we lack physical switch redundancy from ourselves to our ISP. Unfortunately I can't solve that at this point, but intend to in the future. My understanding is that I would go from LACP to an MLAG at that point.
 Any recommendations on the switching and firewall technologies in use would be appreciated. I can clarify if needed. Diagram link below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every few weeks our DNS servers are getting DDOSed which causes a lot of issues and phone support calls. 
 We are a pretty small operation internally but we do support 10,000 customers. So when things go out we can expect 900+ phone calls. And sometimes it's in the middle of the night and after hours when the senior network engineers are not here. But our solution is basic, it's mostly just rerouting traffic and blocking offending IPs.
 Our DNS servers are old and planned on upgrading soon anyways. We are open to spending money on a solution that just manages itself, though it must be all hardware that we must host ourselves.
 Is there any DNS servers and solutions that is like a gold standard with passively handling these kinds of issues? The less overhead of managing it on the security side the better. Though we still need control over it and add our own DNS entries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Absolutely no hints, it's just a CSV on a file share that any user (or service account) could write to. No special permissions on the share or files pointing to who/what wrote these files. We have full admin access to all servers, but there are about 600 in total currently online, and the server names don't provide any hints. We know the old admins sometimes set up automated reporting on DCs and CAs, but not in this case. There is no automation documentation, nor descriptions entered on Active Directory objects (not for servers and not for service accounts).
 Where to start?
 Update: A colleague had disconnected the network from an old 2008 server they thought was ready to be decommissioned, but it actually had a shared directory where an old program was writing logs (daily IVR stats). That share had logs being read by a PowerShell scheduled task which filtered the important data and outputted a CSV, which then hopped to another server that had network access to write to the final destination for the admin assistant to get it and provide daily numbers to the CEO, mystery solved and I hate it, but also thanks all, your suggestions were very helpful!

 Why is that? Couldn’t you just consolidate all SSID’s into one, segment these via VLAN’s? And provision them per policy? Or is that solely dependent on what type of infrastructure is implemented? eg: traffic shaping, policy provisioning etc. 
 Like, wouldn’t you want airwaves etc? Just curious on this.

 Documentation saying SMB Multichannel would detect multiple network interfaces and establish multiple connections on both interfaces to increase the aggregated bandwidth. I can saturate I218 GbE to 940Mbps, but the other I211 stays at 0Mbps.
 I read somewhere saying SMB Multichannel client needs to see two network interfaces with the same RSS and RDMA status in order to use them as the multichannel group.
 PS get-netadaterrss shows I218-V is RSS enabled, and I211 is also RSS enabled.
 PS get-smbclientnetworkinterface shows I218-V: RSS false, and I211: RSS True.
 So does anyone know what accounts for the discrepancy between these two tools?

 I was able to recreate the application pool in the remote application RDS server. Everyone on laptops can log into the application after I setup their remote app web address to the new web address. They login as usual and works no issue.
 But if they try to connect using the RD app on Android or on a Mac using the Microsoft Remote Desktop it doesn't allow then to connect. Gets stuck at configuring session and then errors out after a minute. This is when they publish the workspace and login to the workspace no problem but when actually opening the application thats when it gets stuck.
 Is there a setting that would be causing the Mac and android users to get locked out?
 It worked previously but when I tried to look at the settings on the old RDS server it can already deleted the collection (which was strange).

I honestly had no intention to look into Linux+, but the only reason I'm now considering is a thread over in r/CompTIA where someone asked if they could avoid working on anything Linux related and they were met with a swift, resounding NO.
 After doing some research about this, it seems like it's true, Linux is the backbone for alot of enterprise systems worldwide.
 Aside from installing Mint and using it for a month or two many years ago because my old laptop kept BSODing on me on Windows and Mint got around that issue, I kinda know nothing about it.
 I don't have a solid plan for what I want to do, because it's kinda difficult to know what you want to do if you don't have the experience nor have you done it before. If I really had to choose it would be Windows Administration or Cyber Security. All I got is the a+ net+ and Sec+, and right now I got interviews set up to transfer to being a cyber analyst.
 I am well aware of the RHSA cert, but just humor me for a second: is Linux+ actually worth it for someone like me that knows almost nothing about Linux?
 If it helps, job listings in my local area don't say Linux+ is required but Linux experience is preferred. Being certified =/= experience but I'd imagine it helps in some way.

Late wednesday night got an email saying, let's also migrate to teams and teams phone by the end of the year. My boss is on vacation so when he gets back I'm asking him to try talk to said executive to push this back. We're a two man IT team for a large company. We're great at our job but we can't make miracles happen. I'm. personally making the argument that I tend to be a perfectionist and I rather have the extra time to make it a good experience for our end users than to roll out something that's half assed. /rant
 That all being said, Bossman and I really need some crash courses for this stuff if we have any hope of making this happen. We're good at learning by doing but I'm sure there's 100 things we need to learn for teams and teams calling as far as migrating and administration goes. 
 Yes I know this isn't everyone's first choice, but our hands will probably be tied for making this happen. Besides, we've been wanting to consolidate a lot of the services we have for easier administration, single sign on, all that jazz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Several years ago, I installed for a client a full highly available RDS farm, and everything work smoothly as far I recall. back to last month, the client has found that when the database is no longer owned by the "regular" SQL server, the farm stop working. So I'm looking for what can cause such a mess, because in the last 4 years, I did'nt touch the farm configuration, but the client did (and the client has changed his IT team twice over the 4 last years).
 For information, it's a 2016 RDS farm with a lot of RDSH, but the main part is the 2 RD Broker, with a database hosted on 2 SQL boxes, with alwaysOn, 2 RD gateways, 2 RD WebAccess and 2 RD licence servers.
 Everything works fine until you manually (or after a reboot) change the replica's owner from the SSMS, then the active broker logs that it cannot contact the database, and everything failed (I waited for more than an hour to be sure, but nothing automatically fixes the mess).
 If I use the cmdlets Get-RDConnectionBrokerHighAvailability, I can see that the database connection is made on the AlwaysOn Listner as expected. The only weird things is that in the registry the database connection is set to one of the SQL servers instead (in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tssdis\Parameters\DBConnString)
 Anyone can help me troubleshoot this ?

 Long story short, I'm in the middle of trying to fix a network that was improperly setup with public IP's.This network was given a /24 of public address's and rather than properly NAT'ing them when needed, every single desktop, laptop, desk phone, printer, and server was given one of these public address statically. The only "security" this network had was no dhcp server.. (Not that I or any of us here consider that security.)
 I'm currently attempting to deploy a new network that is properly segmented with private IP's using different VLAN's and subnets behind a firewall. I'll be using NAT on the firewall for anything that actually needs a public IP address.

 Any idea how to force it to UK for everything either by group policy or during install (via SCCM) as it's messing up the proofing languages in Office.

 Looking for on-prem ticket system. Something light weight and customizable. While end users are not supposed to send protected information in a ticket, some end up doing it. 
 It would be nice if it looked a bit modern and has integration with Microsoft Teams for ticket creation and notification.
 I was thinking of creating one internally using O365 Sharepoint and automate. Only 4 admins use it, so in theory should not be super complicated or fancy.

 I'm a rather new Sysadmin (3 months) who has more or less worked my way into Powershell and adding automation into our environment. At the current moment I'm pushing out a simple task that restarts our EUDs. The problem is, a hand full of devices are claiming to have completed but returns the code 3221225794. This cannot be a permissions issue as it is run with local system.
 So far I've tried as follows: -Creating a new task: Powershell and cmd.exe both don't work still. -Using a different account: Runs on local admin accounts fine, but due to restrictions cannot use local admin for all tasks.
 We are running Win10 (x64), and all the affected devices are Dell Laptops. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and feel free to ask for additional clarification!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After installing KB5019966 or later updates on Domain Controllers (DCs), you might experience a memory leak with Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS,exe). Depending on the workload of your DCs and the amount of time since the last restart of the server, LSASS might continually increase memory usage with the up time of your server and the server might become unresponsive or automatically restart. Note: The out-of-band updates for DCs released November 17, 2022 and November 18, 2022 might be affected by this issue.
 Workaround: To mitigate this issue, open Command Prompt as Administrator and use the following command to set the registry key KrbtgtFullPacSignature to 0:
 reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\KDC" -v "KrbtgtFullPacSignature" -d 0 -t REG_DWORD 
 Note: Once this known issue is resolved, you should set KrbtgtFullPacSignature to a higher setting depending on what your environment will allow. It is recommended to enable Enforcement mode as soon as your environment is ready. For more information on this registry key, please see KB5020805: How to manage Kerberos protocol changes related to CVE-2022-37967.
 Next steps: We are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.

 ​
 Hoping someone could shunt me in the right direction here.
 I had a user email to say they couldn't delete a folder into SharePoint blah blah blah. Up until, in my dom admin account, I couldn't either... I keep getting the error "The Resource has changed since the caller last read it; usually an eTag mismatch"
 ​
 I've got to level with myself, I have never seen this error in the years I have been doing 365. I'm an owner of the site itself, so I have full read, write, and execute perms.
 ​
 I've got the user to re-sync the folder up to SharePoint to see if it would merge the two and then able to delete it. No dice. Was thinking I might have to go down the PS route to forcefully rip it off. Has anyone done this before? Has anyone seen this error before?
 ​
 Many thanks

 Thing is, the traffic that needs to be encrypted has the source/destination pair of IPs as the tunnel’s source/destination itself.
 How is this setup working? The crypto ACL is based on “IP”.. from my perspective, the tunnel itself shouldn’t come up.. because the first UDP 500 packet will start looking for a tunnel to traverse which doesn’t exist in the first place.. 
 What am I missing? What is it that is making this setup work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 We received 500 devices like tablets, and phones. I need to create an list of the name, serial number, manufactur and as an extra additional data like components or memory.
 The devices have no barcode and only written serial number on their backs. I thought there is maybe a way to plugin the device and make a software which collects the data and write it into a list. Not sure, All of it is android so I think I could enable ADB on those and somehow with developer mode could get that data but still thinking of options. Our erasure software won't delete (and catch the data) as they are ALL ROOTED and the software don't allow it....
 Ideas, dear colleagues? 👌

 I know there's a limit per shared mailbox of 50GB and then I need to assign license to increase to 100GB storage, but I just need them accessible without licenses so we can cut in cost. So I was wondering if this is possible like I've imagined?

 I was assigned a new task: build a representation of our network architecture.
 The easiest way would be to use Draw.io or Visio but it does not seem very scalable to me as we have a constant growing network.
 I bet there are other tools that can make the job.
 If I am being unclear, I need a scalable tool that displays our routers and their named interconnections on a map. We have a DB of our routers, their links and location so that can be exploited as well. Being able to have multiple layers (core, aggreg and access) and take geolocation into account is a plus.
 Take care!

 I believe I understand the issue, however where do I change the authentication method to use password rather than X509 auth? Would I need to raise it with each vendor to amend the SAML settings, or is there an easily configurable setting within the enterprise app/app registration itself to force it to use password?

 I am swapping out our office network as the previous 3rd party company that was here set up a half-working system. 
 We have Sonicwall in office (firewall + 5 AP) and I was wondering if it would be good idea to swap it out with Fortigate. 
 The reason why I’m working on swapping it out is because the specific AP models that our firewall takes are discontinued. 
 Ruckus was something I wanted but there are also order issues here. The APs and switches won’t arrive for long and I need to fix internet ASAP. It’s super bad. Some areas aren’t covered at all. Even cable internet keeps disconnecting. 
 Fortigate is in stock and available. I can start requisitioning them and fixing office network. 
 I do not have ANY experience with Forti and I do not want to make a rushed decision because of time constraints. 
 Can any of you tell me what your experience with Fortigate has been? Does it support seamless transitions, domain authentication, etc? How reliable are they? 
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm struggling a bit with this. We have a datacenter location and multiple branchoffices.
 The datacenter is divided in multiple subnets. Now when we do a ping to domain.local on a machine in the datacenter that's not in the same subnet as the DC we get a reply from a random DC in a branchoffice. I checked the logonserver and that's correct.
 I know how DNS round robin and DNS Netmask Ordering work now. But I can seem to figure out how to get a reply from the DC in the other subnet in the datacenter.
 We use all class A networks. To make it simple:
 Datacenter:
 10.1.0.0/23: Where the DC is at.
 10.2.0.0/23: The client where you do the ping to domain.local from.
 Branchoffice 1:
 10.3.0.0/24
 Branchoffice 2:
 10.4.0.0/24
 ​
 Can someone help me in how I can configure this?

 I woke up a few days ago (late in the day because working late) to find that our hypervisors lost connection to the storage server. All of the virtual machines still running without disks basically. The storage server basically died on me while I was asleep at home. After fixing issues with the storage server (some faulty hardware and a failing RAID), I powered back on our hypervisors and started restoring from backups.
 For a minute, I thought we lost all of our data, all of our servers, and were not going to be able to bring anything back online for a few days. But I was able to fix everything wrong with the storage server (since the power issue was due to a PCIe card failing, and did maintainence) and bring back online most of our VMs without issue. The only VM we lost was a test server that was created that night. 
 Although I was able to recover basically everything, I still have decided to improve our backups and retention system. It was a life safer this time but I think we definitely could have better backups. 
 It's things like this that make you not regret doing the extra work for backups and fail safes (even if they might suck to set up at times). Made me definitely feel good about my backup systems and plan in case this kinda thing happens. Now I'm taking what I had before and adding on top of it; since I have an actual reference incident to go off of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this. I’ll keep my background brief: I’m still fairly green in the IT field as a whole, let alone as a sysadmin. I have only been working full time post-college for almost two years now, and this is my first job straight out of the gate as the sole IT resource on-site for a company of roughly 250 users and growing rapidly.
 I have some assistance from an MSP, someone who I can bounce questions off of and turn to in a pinch. Outside of that, I’m alone. To say it’s been stressful is an understatement. My company expects me on call 24/7 and everyone has my personal cell and abuses it and refuses to use a ticketing system. All that aside, I want to ask for help, as that is the only foreseeable alternative to me up and quitting. While I have been looking for other jobs, I haven’t actually had a talk with my bosses about how I’m feeling. Mainly because I am not the first IT guy in this role, which has always been filled by one person. I don’t want to be seen as “that guy” who can’t handle it like the previous guys did and ask for an extra person, as I feel like that would just make them look down on me. I know that probably seems dumb, that’s just where my head goes. Like I said, at this point getting some help is the only thing that would make me stay for longer. I just don’t know how to approach my bosses and what to even say. Does anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation?
 Thanks for reading.

 Our current wireless cert was created on our DC and then distributed through Group Policy. We have recently started using endpoint to create our images and we are also going AzureAD joined devices. It looks like to get our wireless to connect automatically we need a Azure AD proxy which needs to be installed on a NDES server which needs a Certificate Authority Server which we currently don’t have.
 I dont have much experience with CA and I was wondering if I install the CA if im able to import the current wireless cert so I wont have to push it out a new cert to everyone?
 Also will installing CA break our wifi or anything else?

 Does anyone here know what happens? Does he archive tab just disappear, do you lose everything you had up until that point, do you lose the view audit logs too?

 I took a look at it - and was a bit horrified. It looks cheap, it is NOT real SDN. Gardner in the low left quadrant. Compared to cisco sd-wan it looks bad ... So i am a bit worried.
 Are there any good experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Our Catalyst 6509's are due to be replaced next year - we have around 8 of these deployed at different sites which have 1G connections back to our data centers. I've seen a few posts suggesting that Nexus 9K devices should be used to replace the 6509's, there is also a colleague who suggests the same. I was thinking today (when working on a couple of Nexus devices), that they are a bit overkill just for a site? Especially when most of our access switches are still 3560 era.
 ​
 I really do not have much Nexus experience, so I am genuinely interested in what people think and the advantages/disadvantages of them. 
 A colleague and I were speaking today that replacing a C6509 at a site with 2 x Nexus switches in a VPC seems overkill. Especially when there are a maximum of 15 access switches (this is our largest site, some only have 5/6 access switches). We both agreed that a 2/3 stacked 48 port C9300's or equivalent could be a good replacement on the 6509's going forward. They have 10G access and uplink ports and the pair of us agreed that they're easier to set up in terms of HSRP (stacking them will do it). We are also curious to understand the benefits of VPC over standard port-channeling.
 ​
 Sorry for my ignorance on this one, but as I mentioned my Nexus knowledge is poor!
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 Old IT Admin goes into Retirement, really wanted to finish a Firewall Migration intime (No one else knows the damn Infrastructure). I did setup everything. DNAT's, IP's,Policies, handpainted Toplogie... everything. 
 We had to switch the MX Record for Mail Exchange to onprem Exchange. Maybe you know where this is going. 
 Transfered every VLAN. Policies, NAT, Routing to VPN... worked. I was like yea.
 Admin gets a call. I already knew I fucked up.
 Mails aren't getting through (Prio Nr.1 during Migration)...
 Guess who forget to tell the Admin to let the PTR-Record change to new IP.
 Had to do the entire Walk of shame back to the old firewall and then also realise that I'm on vacation on Friday for 2 Weeks. Means no time to finish intime. 
 Misses didn't understand a think and I'm sitting here. Thinking I'm top notch and didn't think about a ducking DNS record...

 I'm looking for a tool - preferably open source - that I can use to create an inventory of the software installed on our fleet of Linux servers (Centos), such as Docker, Telegraf, VIM etc. Basically everything that doesn't get delivered by the base system.
 I've tried searching online, but the only thing I find are inventory systems that run on Linux...
 Any advice? What do you guys use at work?
 Thank you very much in advance! 
 EDIT: Thank you for your help! Much appreciated!

 My current Fortigate's will be EOL next year, they have been great. I couple them with Aryaka SD-WAN for a East Coast to Mid-West site-to-site connection. (Aryaka has been solid as well)
 But, always looking to improve. Need faster... 
 Currently only two locations, redundant 1GIG links at each location. Latency is site to site around ~60ms RT without Arayka. With Aryaka around ~80ms RT 
 The location on the east coat host SQL servers, AD, Print servers, traditional Fileservers. Things are not terrible at the branch location, but you can feel the delay pretty well when accessing. We never actually max out any circuits anywhere. We are only a small/medium size company.
 What could help me out here? A deeper dive into SD-WAN? Silver-Peak? 
 Not sure where to turn....

 We work with video surveillance system mainly network based video surveillance solutions. One of our very old client requested us to get their extremely poorly done network get somewhat managed.
 Couldn't really say no although we are already so so busy with other jobs. It is a 2 story building with multiple racks on each floors, we are required to identify each port and label them at both ends.
 Any idea how we can do this job in a speedy yet efficient manner?
 Don't really want my technicians to run around from one end to another manually taking out cables which could take forever given the fact each floor has somewhere in between 20+ lan points. 
 Any tips would be highly appreciated.
 Much thanks.

 ​
 I'm currently having the issue that sometimes when I try to logon to a server via remotedesktop the connection fails with "the logon attempt failed".
 Yesterday someone else had that issue, while I was able to connect to those servers.
 The problem doesn't always occur. It seemingly happens randomly and also fixes itself after some time passed like 1 to 2 hours.
 While the issue persists on one workstation from a different workstation you might be able to connect with the same login credentials at that time.
 ​
 It doesn't affect a single server and also happens with different operating systems of those servers (Windows Server 2008r2, Windows Server 2019) two of the currently affected servers are DC's. The affected DCs are Windows Server 2008r2 and the other 2 DCs that are not affected are Windows Server 2019. There are also other servers than DCs that are affected.
 - Trying to remote with the server IP adress didn't work directly but now it's working and the connection with the hostname still isn't working
 - The servername is beeing resolved correctly.
 - The affected servers are Pingable while the issue persists.
 - Last Windows Updates of those Servers were in October 
 Did anyone else have similar problems/knows what might be the issue here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking for views on this and keep seeing conflicting points. Some say everything should be virtual, others suggest a physical DC.
 The issue we're trying to address is at present all our DCs are virtual - all our hypervisors are Hyper-V
 We recently did a full shutdown to carry out some electrical work. What we realized is that if the DCs didn't come backup automatically for whatever reason with the hypervisor then we wouldn't be able to authenticate with domain credentials onto the Hyper-V host.
 Alternatively I guess we could use local admin, but we use LAPs so again we need domain access to pull up the local admin password.
 As a bonus question - we have a Veeam backup solution which is also currently virtualised. Again my question is should this be physical? It's not using tapes, just backing up to separate SANs.
 If we couldn't get into our virtual environment, we wouldn't be able to do anything with our Veeam backups? We'd have to quickly build a Veeam server to access and restore our backups? Am i missing something

 Does it make a difference how to call the exe-file (&, Invoke-Expression, Invoke-Item, start-process)? Or is HP just to stupid to offer a tool which is able to give back a returncode to my script?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had an email through this am about a forced upgrade of all our MFPs from Konica Minolta (a brand which I think are pretty good) to Sharp and Lexmark.
 I was hoping others may be able to share their wisdom with these two brands, as I've never used them before and don't want us to be thrust into agreeing for a product that has well-known issues or quirks. 
 The specific models are 
  
Sharp BP70M75 (replacing a Konica Minolta Bizhub 654)
 Sharp MXB456W (replacing a Konica Minolta Bizhub 4020)
 Sharp BP50C26 (replacing a Konica Minolta C287)
 Lexmark C4342 (replacing a Konica Minolta C3100P)
  
The fact that we're having two brands replace one, doesn't sit well with me, but maybe this is standard practice. 
 I'd be interested to hear your thoughts, as I've always rated Konica Minolta highly (perhaps wrongly so??)

 Unfortunately, when googling for "definitive DNS data" I can only find standard articles describing the different DNS entries and nothing about the security relevant topic. For me this whole field around DNS a bit confusing and would be very grateful for some help or resources regarding this topic.
 I hope this is the right community for this question.

 Ideally the routing would be local, as close to the source as possible. So if a host connected to DC2 wants to communicate with a host connected to DC2 on different VLANs, it would not be necessary for the traffic to travel to DC1 and back to be routed.
 Is this possible with MLAG? Do I need VRRP over MLAG? Or do I need EVPN-VXLAN?

 Scenario: 200 workers (mostly programmers), hybrid work, vpn.
 50% workers with client machines (win) 49% workers with office(domain) machines (win) 1% workers with office(domain) Linux
 Workers with client machines need access to internet and at least one local server
 The other workers like other company, some administration, programmers, etc and have his own servers and shared resources. this is what i am interested in isolating
 My first and only idea was try implement something wih packetfence and radius, for begin, create a VLAN for authenticate users and the isolate ass guest users with only internet use (no portal/no auth).
 The problem if activate 802.1x in the switchs , desk assignments are not fixed, and I did not get nor do I know if it is possible to validate an incorrect identification attempt as guest (user with client machine) or simple bypass users outside the domain and accept the radius query as a guest. Packetfence/Radius always block.
 Any ideas for the easiest way, dynamic, and without very specific and expensive software/hardware to implement some security?
 The switchs in this network even above they are bad (dlink), there is one that accept mac auth, the rest only 802.x / port based, they buy two years ago, and they are not about to change them

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of Dell's documentation says that uninstalling Dell Optimizer is as simple as "DellOptimizer.exe /remove" but whenever I try to run that I get the error that DellOptimizer.exe is not recognized as an internal or external command. I did also try running the command from the Optimizer program files folder. Am I missing something?
 Tried using wmic to do it but that doesn't seem to recognize the "Dell Optimizer Service" part and leaves that installed.
 Edit: Correction, when I use the full path to the programs file folder I get the error "Windows Service Start Failure" saying that a Windows service must first be installed using installutl.exe and then started with the ServerExplorer or the net start command.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was listening to the long awaited episode of "Well there is your problem", featuring a listener story involving a vat of boiling acid. Which I obviously recommend. 
 And as I listened how very preventably and with constant complaints to managment somebody ended falling in boiling acid, I couldn't help but be thankful. I worked in a lot of poorly configured environments, poor security, poor performance, poor management... Who hasn't. And I have also fucked up a few times. Who hasn't. 
 But NOBODY IS GOING TO DIE if I don't convince management to fix a big issue, nobody is going to die if I fuck. Productivity will be lost, Data may be lost. You may get screamed at, you may be fired, your company may even go under. But nobody is going to be seriously injured. And I think that is worth keeping in mind when the pressure gets to you. 
 Please tell me about your deadly encounters with rack closets and boilers depending on a windows XP computer to not explode.

I know for a fact that they are still there pretty much in their full form because trial versions of Data Recovery software previewed them. However, I'd rather the free command line alternative.
 I've heard of people recommending to back-up a drive as an image first before doing data recovery, but it seems they are usually referring to failing drives. Do I need to back up my external HDD as an image before running such data recovery if I'm just looking for deleted files and the drive is actually working fine?

They are still billing the same project management hours even when other hours have dropped. My monthly billing has become 25% project management because other resources are not working. 
 While I'm trying to get them to provide resources I also want to manage their non-value added expenses when people aren't working. I don't mind paying for meeting coordination and resource management when I see actual work and on really large projects I am not surprised by 5-10% but at this point, it feels like I am just paying them to send me the bill for the few hours I actually get and the e-mails apologizing that they don't have resources to do the job.

 they lock from the sides, from where you put in you patch cable, the plate's hole is not standard size, as they are almost square.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got "promoted" at my company but actually got screwed over and left as the only IT person for a business unit that was sold. Was doing desktop support, junior administration tasks. However at once I was left in charge of everything, management, budgets, helpdesk, desktop support, server admin, network admin/engineer, network security, citrix, vmware, O365 admin, you name it. 
 I was only given a small raise but not what people that are responsible for this make. Worst thing is that it's not actually these advanced tasks killing me but the day to day helpdesk/desktop support. The company is fairly large for a one person plus on insane embarking of growing fast - so lots of changes, openings, purchases of small companies, onboardings non-stop. Management is abusive as well.
 People are quitting left and right this place. Think of what the media says of twitter, but not twitter. 
 in any case, they won't hire anyone else, in fact I can barely make purchases. 
 I've figured is a losing battle and is mentally breaking me. I've spent about past 2 or 3 months working 12 hour days, stressed, working weekends, have pulled about 3 all nighters and work 12 hours next day, no extra pay, etc.
 I was doing it because it was the chance of a lifetime for me to get out of "desktop support", but have only been able to get my feet wet in everything of the advanced items. So far I have been successful but the low wage along with the abuse and the work overload have made me decide I can't do it anymore.
 ​
 However I feel stuck, I don't want to go back to desktop support as that will lower my wage more, but I can't get a full system administration, network administration role as I'm no expert in these and I don't know what to do. Have been applying to jobs and have an interview next week, but any advice is appreciated, I'm truly in a desperate situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Want to get your thoughts on datacenter switches, specifically between Aruba and Dell. Specifically I am looking at the Dell 4128 vs 6300M models.
 Dell is priced very well with 5 years support and prodeploy included. Everything looks great with them and all my servers and SANs are Dell. Some have said some negative things about Dell switches on this forum, weird CLI, difficult to work with, but those comments seem to be related more to OS9/Force10 and not OS10.
 On the other hand, all my access switches are Aruba and they have been flawless. Ive heard a lot of good things about Aruba and they were rated very well in the 2021 gartner report for wired and wireless LAN. Dell doesn't even seem to rank on this report. The Aruba quote is around 1.7x the price of the Dell quote. 
 I'm running Cisco currently. They aren't a contender because they absolutely blew the doors off with their price. I'm talking 5 times the others. I almost laughed at our MSP on the call. 
 Are any of you running Dell datacenter switches, specifically with OS10? Anyone running Aruba? How has it been for you?

 Please keep in mind I'm a complete novice to networking and excrutiatingly dumbed down explanations are very much welcomed.
 I see a global unicast address has the value 2000::/3 and I'm really struggling to understand how the slash notation correlates to the range of addresses it somehow represents.
 I don't think it helps because all the explanations I'm seeing speak of subnetting (which I'm familiar with in IPv4) but on the other hand I've got a CCNA instructor telling me subnetting doesn't exist within IPv6? 
 Help is very much appreciated as this is the first topic I've come across where I've really not been able to find the answer on my own. Thanks in advance.

 Does anyone know a way to test PPPoE without a line?
 For more context, we have a Palo Alto, a cisco switch which we are configuring for a remote site.
 Compared to our other sites, this one is the only one with a PPPoE line and we'd like to somehow do a mock with a laptop and the equipment so hopefully and plug and play job for when we send the kit out.
 We plan to have one of our Palo interfaces be the primary port for this line and want to test in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the second workstation that I have seen this issue happen on. No idea where the issue is. 
  
Workstation A can ping Workstation B by name and it responds with the correct IP. 
 NSLookup for Workstation B while on Workstation A is showing correct info. 
 Workstation A can RDP to other workstations and servers by name without issue. 
 Workstation A can RDP to Workstation B via IP
 Workstation C can RDP to Workstation B by name using same credentials that user on Workstation A is using. 
 Workstation A cannot RDP to Workstation B with other users credentials (that are successfully able to RDP from other workstations) when RDP via IP. 
  
Cleared RDP Connection History following this article. Cleared Windows Credential Manager stored passwords. 
 Not sure if anyone else has run into this recently.
 Edit: 
 Issue seemed to have fixed itself with just time it appears. I followed up with a client from a few days ago that was having this issue and tried connecting via workstation name and it worked. Just tried again with the Workstation A that I was troubleshooting this morning, and it worked again. No reboot was done on anything. As people have suggested it may be related to the Kerberos update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm relatively new to the linux side of things, I switched my homelab over from mostly windows to almost pure linux to really learn it. I recently started dabbling in ansible and holy hell, it feels like I unlocked a cheat code. I can do things that would normally take me half hour+ to just as long as it takes to type the command out. My whole infra can be updated immediately, and I can make any change I want instantly to as many or as few servers as I want.
 I recently stood zabbix up, and I was able to get snmpd installed, configured, and the firewall ports opened opened on all dozen or so of my vm's by just typing out a playbook. I was so proud of myself when I checked the systems I ran it against and everything was exactly how I had specified in the playbook. I've still a lot to learn about ansible, but I really am kicking myself now for not looking at it sooner. I want to try and look into deploying new vm's with it next and work on automating a lot of tasks like updates, and get a better understanding of grouping devices.
 Learning linux has made me really loathe working with windows at my job, and I hope to one day make the jump to linux administration.

 The user who are connected on sslvpn cannot touch the server who have the other firewall has gateway.

 Everything, was working fine till these November updates. 
 I am using a DC with WS2012 R2 and after I installed the updates of November, domain users are taking a very long time to login or to log off on the domain PCs. Also, we can not access the shared drives. Sometimes it works when we access them trhough IP, but it does not work anymore with the server name. 
 I installed also the OOB, but no luck. Also I added this reg. but no success. 
 reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\kdc" /v ApplyDefaultDomainPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f 
 I will try to uninstall once again both the updates, but I do not have high hopes.
 Do you guys have an idea? what we can do to fix this?

 Then for example if I search for some specific account(service) I will see which servers it is used on and which services are being affected when I change pw. etc..
 Best if free tool, can be selfhosted.

After a restart, or a unmap drive letter, map drive letter the file is gone. Sometime files are also looks corrupted, for instance a preview is shown, but I am unable to open it. When I try to copy the files to a new location it often shows errors for files I am able to open. 
 I desperatly need most (if not all) files on this hard drive (of course there is no fking backup, thanks to the prev sysadmin). Also the company won’t pay any money for a hard drive recovery service because some files are sensitive.
 My question is, would it solve my issues if I use a hard drive cloning device (will the files be corrupted even then?) , or shall I try some software like Acronis True Image? Please help me get these files back, my job depends on it.

 What I have seen from other people using a load balancing router to increase their bandwith is that some connections can't split the packages across 2 seperate IPS-to-user lines and others can.
 I was wondering if Parsec does split data when I merge two IPS DSL lines by using a load balancing router to get 100 down and 16 up for the faster upload.

 No windows updates were done this month.
 Other virtuals in a different domain on the same proxmox server work correctly.

 I'm trying to find an answer to what feels like a very simple question. On a 100GBase-SR4 connection (let's say between two switches) if one fibre or one pair fails, what is the behaviour? Is the connection lost or does it simply degrade in performance (eg dropping to 50/25/10Gbps)? I can't find an answer to this anywhere.
 I presume any answer would apply equally to LR4 or copper connections.
 Thanks!

We plan to put up some iPads with "Guided Access" (see https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/guided-access-ipada16d1374/ipados) in branch locations and a webpage where visitors can give feedback. Network is achieved by a data SIM in the iPad.
 This is all working good, but now we are looking for a way to remotely unlock the devices, update it to the last iOS version and lock it again. 
 We looked at using an MDM like https://jumpcloud.com/ or a remote tool like TeamViewer, but so far we were not successful. There does not seem to be an option in jumpcloud to force an update and the remote tools could only view the screen but you could not interact let alone deactivate guided access and reactivate it. 
 Does anybody have a solution for this kind of problem?

Based on documentation that I found, you can search within Azure AD portal to determine using the Sign-In Event triggers on an individual employee basis but wondering if there was something more detailed.

 Current spend on 8 cloud servers per month is around £700 so looking to reduce that if possible.
 The idea is to reduce hosting cost and standardise to docker containers so developer and release process is easier.
 I have some Docker knowledge, but little Docker Swarm/K8s knowledge, I would rather not maintain the infrastructure if possible.
 I'm interested in a setup that would provide some redundancy/resilience for us - none of the servers have high traffic.
 I've looked at self hosted docker swarm, AWS ECS, Vultr, sloppy.io.
 Best solution I have in mind at the moment is to private rent a meaty server from Hetzner and setup docker on there, but this fails to give any redundancy in case that server fails.

 I'm right now researching for a Project which I'm not able to Lab atm. thats why I'm asking here :).
 ​
 Customer came from a Sophos UTM which did Reverse Proxy and Default Gateway. Now he bought a Fortigate with a FortiWeb (Reverse Proxy / WAF)
 ​
 Now we think about the Network Design.
 I thought about the following:
 DNAT from Fortigate to FortiWeb(WAF) into the DMZ
 Then FortiWeb has Default Route on FortiGate which then routes traffic to the Webservers, which are all on a seperate VLAN. 
 ​
 Routing should work, but I have a feeling that SSL Offloading on the FortiWeb doesn't, since Session is being internally route and response comes back from different IP (Webserver). Can anyone confirm or entlighten me ?
 ​
 Thank you very much

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Just wanting to get some of your input about this, a client has asked me a job spec as I've recommended they hire a full time IT presence rather than fully relying on my MSP as there are too many gaps in the infrastructure that would be too expensive to sort via the MSP. 
 They currently don't have any IT staff so it would be a sole role with general support stuff, maintaining infrastructure, going ahead with minor upgrades, creating documentation and standardising some operations. With the MSP dealing with a lot of the larger upgrades, projects, patching, auditing and improvement recommendations.
 The infrastructure is quite small, manageable and not too complex but with a lot of room and time to learn and progress personally. I'm just wondering what job title you would expect to see this as? Part of me thinks it should be IT manager since they'll be the only onsite IT responsibility. On the other hand a lot of it will be dealt with by the MSP and the tasks required wouldn't require a seasoned manager as the MSP will be a fall back, so it seems like a good role for someone somewhat experienced to step up in terms of responsibility.
 Just wondering what your thoughts and points are? I don't want to recommend hiring a SysAdmin and them falling out of depth, being underpaid for the job and unhappy but on the contrary, I don't want to tell my client to overspend on someone who is overqualified and would get bored.

 I manage AS33 which has two uplinks to one provider (ISP A) and one uplink to another provider (ISP B). One of the traffic engineering tasks is to route inbound traffic to my prefix in priority via Router A connected to ISP A.
 It is trivial on Router B connected to ISP A by prepending the as-path. But here's the tricky bit the ISPs have a peer-to-peer connection thus the local preference is lower than their provider-customer routes to me (reference). The local prefence over my route is 90 to their peer 40. I did prepend the path here just to see if it works.
 As far as I understood weight and local preference are evaluated first and the as-path is not taken into account so how do I overcome this? Is there a way to only advertise my network 33.0.0.0/8 when the link to ISP A fails?
 We are using FRR v7.5

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdie all,
 it's all very new. Info is a bit scant. And as we are about to buy some more (if we actually have to). I'd be really grateful for some answers if anybody knows. Resellers sometimes don't know/understand everything correctly. Beeing able to fact check them is always a good idea.
 Our reseller is pretty solid, so I doubt they'll do the "get it wrong on purpose to sell more expensive packages"... 
 ​
 So starting October Windows Server can be licensed per virtual core. With a minimum of 8 virtual cores per VM.
 Question 1:
 When they say virtual cores do they really mean virtual "cores" or do they mean virtual threads. Basically can I have a vm with 16 threads assigned and only use a 8 core licenses?
 With physical cores it was actual cores. So our 2x16C server has 32 Cores and we needed 32 core licenses. But could use 64 threads as they are all multithreaded.
 ​
 Question 2:
 Are existing physical core licenses we have now automaticall virtual core licenses as well?
 We have 32 Core licenses. Which allowed us to run 2 windows servers maximum. If they are now virtual core licenses as well. We could theoretically run 4 windows servers with 8 cores each.
 ​
 Question 3:
 All client/device CALs need to be either subscription or with SA. is another prereq from what I gathered.
 Is that referring to windows server CALs only. Or exchange CALs as well. What about RDP CALs?
 Our windows server and exchange CALs have SA so we are good with those. But our RDP CALs do not. Will that preclude us from using these new virtual core licenses for an RDP server?
 ​
 any feedback most appreciated

 I'm looking for an alternative to Microsoft Sharepoint as the more I use it, the more I hate it. It's really bad.
 So I'm looking for a paid alternative with multi-language support. Our Intranet pretty much exists of a website with a menu that leads to different categories and pages, a site content database and a good looking homepage.
 The most important thing is the homepage since our employees see it first. In sharepoint, we have a cascade of 5 visual items of the latest news, under that the most important events in the upcoming week(s) and under that some handy links that they can click on.
 So looking for something similar to that, but it doesn't necessarily need to be an interactive workspace where employees can share files, work together, etc. A simple, but functional and good looking Intranet website would do. And yeah, it needs to be multilingual. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning from the wet, windy, wild UK, fellow Sysadmin's. 
 In creating my YT / LinkedIn content for the M365 world and seeking new solutions to problems, I came across a really handy PowerShell module I'd like to share with you: IntuneBackupAndRestore. 
 Find it on Github here: https://github.com/jseerden/IntuneBackupAndRestore
 It's a module which is written specifically to backup your Intune instance; policies, script contents, settings catalogs, admin templates.. It seems pretty full featured. It hasn't been maintained for over a year, and I haven't yet tested a restore.. But essentially the tool:
 1) Connects to your tenant
 2) Exports all the config into JSON
 3) Organises that into folders
 4) Puts it on any storage you can access
 I've tested the backup in my (very small) tenant, and it seems to work really, really well. 
 There's full documentation for the module in the repo for further reading, just wanted to make people aware of it's existence.
 Remember; MS don't back any of this stuff up. If you made a mistake or some disgruntled, over privileged monkey trashes your environment the day they leave, they won't help you. Unlikely? Yes. Impossible? No. 
 Personally, I'm going to setup some Azure storage and then automate the script to run once a week and export everything there. 
 Hope someone finds this useful. Happy hump day!

 I have disabled user to have permissions to regedit so i need to run it as Admin but to apply the regs on current logged user.?

 $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force

 To point out this is becouse iam lazy and i dont want to convert every reg-file update ( for win11 ) manualy , the idea is to just import it via script and redownload new reg file from source.Simple clean, otherwise i need to manualy go download convert it to XML and import it in GPO.

A while ago Gmail locked down their services so you can no longer use that feature labeling it a "security update" when they removed it. I moved over to yahoo and it was working up until about 4-6 months ago. They are doing the samething now but lying about it saying feature is disabled for "a redesign" but its been disable for like 4-6 months now...
 Basically I'm looking for a free email provider that allow 3rd party app usage. If that requires app password generation thats fine but it needs to be a free feature included with basic free mail.
 Anyone recommend any free email host providers that will allow this function? Obviously ones that are not gmail or yahoo.
 At one point I was looking into proton mail but I forgot why that wasn't going to work. I think there was an email sent limit or something that turned me off from using it.

The client can ping every device in the source list defined in phase 2 however i can only hit the most recent device the client ping me from in his range.
 For example if the client pings my PC from .8 i can then ping .8 as much as i want, but if the client then pings me from .7 i can ping .7 but i can no longer ping .8.
 The client has to initiate traffic for phase 2 to come back up if i taken the tunnel down. We've exhausted more than one Fortinet support tech on this, anyone ever encountered this before?

 I guess my question is, how effective is studying to actually land a role with 0 experience. And I don't mean studying items that one has hands on access to, definitely good to lay good foundations one has access to, but actually studying things that one has no access to other than labs, etc.
 Are certifications for people that are in the role to prove their knowledge with a brief refresh? or do they help at all in landing a better job with no prior experience in that field where certified.

All ports on the other switches go offline for over a minute. The standby becomes the new master but it seems like the stack election is taking a long time. This should be close to instant shouldn’t it? Is there some configuration I’m missing for this to be faster or is that the expected behaviour?

 TLDR; stagger your server power on times to prevent power surges. 
 RFO:
 On November 23, 2022 at 02:41 GMT, CenturyLink identified a service impact in Orlando, FL. Operations Center (NOC) was engaged to isolate and investigate the cause of the outage. Initial analysis showed that a power failure in the Orlando area was the cause of the outage. The local power company repaired the commercial power but when all systems in the office tried to restore at once, the power surge tripped the main power breakers. Field Operations were onsite and reset the breakers to restore service at 03:36 GMT on November 23, 2022. The NOC will continue to monitor the alarms to ensure stability has been achieved.

I'll most likely run another backup using FTP instead as the failure has me a bit nervous that the files may be incomplete or corrupt. Has anyone else seen this behavior before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I have a network with multiple subnets at many locations. At location B, I have a SonicWALL configured with the network 10.30.19.x, with the SonicWALL serving as the DHCP server. The SonicWALL has a VPN to the datacenter. Clients are connected via Meraki switches and APs in bridged mode. Some clients at location B are receiving 10.30.11.x addresses from the DHCP server at location C, which also has a VPN connection to the data center. Is there a way to block DHCP requests from traversing the VPN? If not, how can I force location B clients to only use the local SonicWALL for DHCP? I appreciate any advice, as I don't want to break a production environment if at all possible! Happy Thanksgiving.
 ​
 edit: Devices at location C are also getting IPs from location B

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is kind of a noob question but I'm wanting to setup a way to automate as much of the process as I can for new Windows 10 installs on desktops for end users. I'm wanting to achieve the below:
  
Run Windows 10 setup (unattended)
 
Boot into Windows and run Windows Updates, download drivers (Detect if GPU Intel/NVIDIA/AMD and download most up-to-date driver), run DISM/SFC/CHKDSK/Defender and reboot
 
Run updates again then reboot (at least x2)
 
Run Prime95 for 15 mins and write results to log file
 
Run memtest
 
Update BIOS
 
 ​
 Would a PXE server be the best way to go about the Windows 10 install itself, and can this be configured to run in unattended mode? I've created a batch file which will run DISM, SFC scan, schedule a CHKDSK for the next reboot, run a Windows Defender quick scan, run Windows updates and schedule a reboot for 30 minutes but I'm assuming there are better ways of doing this, especially since I'd need to manually copy this file across once the initial install has been completed and execute it manually. Any advice is appreciated!

Our organization implemented the Microsoft PAM solution (from mim 2016) with a management forest (all on-premise). we have several scripts that have stopped working recently that execute within the management forest the Corp forest trusts the management forest but it is a one way trust. the issue is when I try to authenticate to the corp forest with corp\username authentication fails, but if i use corp.consanto.com\username it succeeds. I have messed with lmhosts etc. to try to fix this and have had no luck. there is a lot of scripts using similar authentications and I really don't want to update everything, would rather figure out why it suddenly stopped working after years of working fine. has anyone ran into this or something similar with the recent security hardening?

 example script:
 $user = get-credentials #corp\username and password

 We opened a new branch office and a S2S VPN tunnel is up between both Palo Alto firewall between branch office to HQ office. My question is, the layer 3 Cisco switch at the branch office using static IP addresses, what would be the next hop so that the branch office knows how to communicate with other IP networks at HQ? 
 I can ping the main physical interface 1(native) network 10.8.10.0/24 from the branch office to HQ, but cannot ping another sub-interface networks that live in HQ. 
 So far, this is the current IP static routes on the branch office layer 3 Cisco switch:
 Ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.8.30.1 <- PA eth 1 gateway interfac Ip route 10.8.1.0/24 <- what would be the next hop for 10.8.30.0 network to communicate with other networks at HQ? 
 Ip route 10.8.0.0/24 <- what would be the next hop for 10.8.30.0 network to communicate with other networks at HQ? 
 I can ping from the Branch office to HQ subnet 10.8.10.0 which is the network on the physical interface at HQ but I can’t ping other networks as sub-interface. Is this a routing issue?

The group I was part of even had us do after action reports (AAR), and I swear its 1:1 what I have to do at my job. IDK how I would have been able to build this skillset in "the real world" with a similar level of non-consequence for failure.

 I searched the internet for articles about how to choose the right transceivers. I know that two transceivers will work together if they have the same wavelength and fiber type (MM or SM). All those articles talked about SFPs. They didn't mention their compatibility with GBICs.
 So my question is can SFP work together with GBIC if they share the same specifications (wavelength and fiber type)? Must they be with the same speed or can I buy 10gig SFP and connect it to 1gig GBIC?
 Thank you!

 2: Corporate

 I am working on running fiber home runs but in the meantime, many of these switches are daisy chained. So for example, floor 1 switch would have the router coming into port 1 and port 2 would go to floor 2 switch port 1. Port 2 from this switch would go to floor 3 switch port 1 and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I've been tasked with creating a hidden SSID for a small group of devices. These devices should ONLY be able to communicate with themselves in their respective subnet, i.e no access to other subnets or WAN. This SSID will need to be implemented in all 8 of our locations and the devices will travel to different locations. 
 We have a 2 tier architecture, so each location's distribution layer also handles the routing up to our main office. Our use of VLANS is minimal, we have 3 for VoIP, Data, and Management. Our wireless AP's are Ruckus. Our wireless LAN is using the "Management" vlan, or vlan 30 (Interface on SonicWall). This LAN is also what connects our switches to the SonicWall. 
 I'm trying to think of the best way to implement this, but I worry I may be overthinking it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, as the title reads, in an update from a while back I updated to some stable build (I don't remember which one) of Windows 11. I then noticed that my task scheduler script wasn't working, I checked whether everything was set up correctly, but then I looked at the Event Viewer, and EventID 4688 for process creation events was nowhere to be found. I then went through the documentation which (at the time) didn't say anything about Windows 11 and then contacted Microsoft, got elevated, and the support told me the feature was no longer supported.
 Now, luckily I only use this event for triggering a launch script, which is relatively easy to do manually through a shortcut, but this is still pretty annoying.
 Other sysadmins use this event for more important stuff, like monitoring the usage of their devices for many different types of purposes.If you want to vote on this feature to return, upvote this post in the Feedback Hub.
 Edit: The story gets, weirder, a recent insider build said it fixed this issue, while support and the technical writers have said that the feature isn't supported. Something really strange must be happening in Redmond...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So. I’ve managed to entrench myself at a small media company as their “tech support/IT/networking/anything nerdy” guy. Problem is a severe lack of understanding and appreciation about the entire field of IT and system support and I’m getting pretty “over it”. It’s a cobbled together network with no servers so nothing more than a UniFi router and switches and some APs, and most of my time is spent just doing tier 1 help desk crap and attempting to make some sort of sense of data management for a video production company that uses 30-60tb a quarter and wants all of it accessible at any time and doesn’t want to delete anything and also doesn’t understand why a production RAID isn’t a backup. 
 I’ve digressed a bit because my ACTUAL question is: even as a very quick learner and problem solver, am I just dead in the water being so out of the loop on industry standard systems and practices? Once upon a time I was a student admin for the defense department in the late 90’s early 00’s so I’m very in the loop in a general way and have plenty of hoop-jumping experience having worked for DOD and dealt with about every major red tape hurdle you could think of for IT and dev teams given the GsA phonebooks of rules and restrictions, BUT I just get dejected looking at current posting when they list about 5-10 different things I’ve never dealt with in my life because there hasnt been a need in my current career path. So I guess what I’m asking is, am I just super behind and if so, is there a resource anyone could recommend for “learning what it is I need to learn about” if that makes sense? I am fully capable of learning a new skill or system very rapidly but I just don’t know where to begin after being left “unsupervised” for this long. Thanks all and be gentle, I’m an old nerd stepping out of a cave for the first time in a decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Need someone's brain I need to pick. I have a classic router on a stick. I'm doing a redesign of core and distribution layer. Would it be best-practice to enable portfast trunk on all interswitch links (core to distribution and distribution to access) to allow for fast reconvergence of my spanning tree? Or is this not recommended? 
 Had an issue today upon enabling a new link on my old core that caused a reconvergence and caused some clusters to lose their connection to their quorum ( thanks SAP); and I want to prevent this in the future.
 EDIT: for anyone finding this post in the future. Portfast trunk should only be enabled on ports linking to ehter a router/firewall or a device containing a virtual switch (Most Hypervisors; eg VMware). For edge devices, use portfast together with bpduguard.

 Trying to do a post-mortem on a weird situation I had yesterday. It seemed that one of our IPSEC VPN LAN-LAN connections was knocking out 2 -3 of our other LAN-LAN VPNs. Not finding anything in the logs besides "IPsec connection was disconnected passively. " There was some network troubleshooting being done at on of the other sites with a VPN, but theirs was not having any issues it seems.
 Tried all the basic troubleshooting/power cycling, rebuilt the VPN connections on each router. All the sudden towards end of day, started working normally. 
 I'm a sysadmin/jack of all trades/helpdesk position. Boss has more networking knowledge, but is out all week. My plan is to have the router in question replaced tomorrow, but wondering if anyone has any ideas, or tips how to get to the bottom of what was happening and if I really need to replace this router in question. It's been stable for about 18 hours.

One problem I am dealing with right now is they are trying to populate the department attribute with both tier 1 and tier 2 departments. Think of it like department and team. Problem is, they are constantly exceeding the 64 character limit since hospital department and team names tend to be a bit verbose. I have tried copious abbreviations but then it looks like code that no one has the deciphering key to. Anyone else who has run into this, how to do manage this? I was thinking of using two separate attributes but if I use something like any of the extensionattributes, obvious these would not be very easily seen by end users. Suggestions?

However a few days later trying to start it up and go through new setup its still connected to my organisation, click continue and it just says failed to get MDM.
 So 2 questions:
 1) Did I release it correctly, I think I did (similar process to Intune devices.

I follows the instructions listed here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/dns-zones-do-not-load-event-4000-4007
 and since this DC with the issue was the PDC I reset using itself as the target and that worked. server rebooted and i can open my dns again. However now i'm noticing the other DC's listing ":error" when looking at operations master in AD, and i can see this error on my PDC role DC that had the dns issue. 
 "Unable to verify the convergence of this machine account. does the machine account need resetting?" I see other people have used netdom to fix this, but i just did reset the machine password as per the Microsoft article so i'm confused if i need to reset it again, and if so with what syntax? or do i need to rest the other DC's? 
 Hopefully someone can explain this a bit better to me. Thanks.

Does Remote Desktop Gateway only support NTLM authentication or is there a way to get it to use Kerberos? No matter what I've tried it always authenticates with NTLM to the Gateway, whether I am on premise or at home using KDCProxy. I've scoured every post on the net I can find but there's no straight answer on this. I've tried the flags rdgiskdcproxy:i:1 (my KDCProxy is my Gateway) and that didn't work. I am running NLA but I don't want to turn that off as that offers protection. I'm aware that NTLM is the protocol that will never die at this point, but if there is a way to implement Kerberos I would love some assistance. Thank you all very much in advance for any help or advice you might have. Gateway is running Windows Server 2022 Datacenter.

Just because your code thinks a "server" is unavailable doesnt mean it actually is. Got one right now. on a server restart it complains that the authentication server is unavailable. Im assuming it means the mssql server that it uses(which is up), and ill base my troubleshooting on that, but i could be wrong. PMs this is why troubleshooting custom applications takes so long!

 I've decided that's fine, I will just do it manually when needed -- whatever. Maybe MS will fix this. Nope. I think it's time to do something else.
 I know that some sysadmins are deploying printers locally to computers by using IP addresses. I'm unfortunately not very fond of this idea as you lose centralized spooler for that printer. Also way less painful if there is network change…]]></summary>

 This problem, however, can immediately be resolved by going downstairs into the room where my router and server co-exist, and simply pressing the power button on said server, waiting until it switches off, then pressing the power button again.
 As soon as I do that, everything returns to normal and everything is up and connected for about 2-3 days until I inevitably wake up the next morning to find everything disconnected again.
 This has only just started to happen, it's been fine up until now.
 Any help is appreciated :)
 Edit: over-use of the word 'again' removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me start this by saying this whole situation is utter hell, but it's a necessity.
 I have a server that came from a company we acquired. On this server, let's call it HV1, we have a HyperV installation with 2 DC's, an APP/RDS Server and a DB server (MS Access), and all of these servers are on Server 2012 R2. This host is sitting cold on the network and will never touch the wider internet. On the APP/RDS server is a proprietary software that was developed by the former company over the course of 15 years and there's no documentation. It talks to MS Access files on the DB server and there is a mapped drive to these files on the APP/RDS server. The software is loaded from the APP/RDS server and seems to be very tied into the domain with domain authentication and will not boot unless one of the two DCs is powered on. If the DCs are off, I get some SQL network errors saying the system cannot contact a DC to service the auth request. Boot them on, the software loads and asks for credentials.
 I now need to repurpose this G9 server and use it for production, which means I need to migrate this setup away from this host and onto an older server which can continue sitting cold for X time. Essentially, replicating the entire setup from one server to another, and the only difference being that I'll be moving it to VMware instead of using HyperV. Instant concern when I was asked for this was the domain controllers.
 I've done the initial backup & restore using Veeam, and I now have all of the servers sat on my new host. The problem of course is the domain and DCs - They aren't functional/working and that domain essentially is non-existent at the moment.
 Before I go any further, I want to have a think about the potential best ways to bring these DCs back to life, purely for the purpose of getting this application working again.
 Thoughts?
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately we're still very much learning how to use Endpoint Management with Azure, as the main business is still on prem. However, the "side business" uses exclusively Azure
 We don't have auto enrolment available to use, and are relying on users logging in on the new laptop. The problem then is that the user becomes local admin, which is bad. The solution to this has been to create an entry in user account protection that sets the only admins as "administrator" (local admin) and a special pcadmin account we created on Azure AD. To my understanding, this is fine
 The issue we have though, is if we need to support a user remotely, we can't elevate privileges in Bomgar (BeyondTrust) using the Azure account, it only seems to support local user accounts. This hasn't been a problem as we were with the users logging into their laptops, so we could set the admin password at the machine, but the case has arisen where I need to do something on a laptop which was bought and remains in another country
 I was hoping I could, as a temporary workaround, add a PS script to enable and set the local admin password, but either it's not working or the laptop just won't sync, because it's not made a difference
 Is there a solution to my problem, or do I need to take a few steps back and make some bigger changes to our system (other than auto-enrolment)
 ​
 Bonus question - my employer will pay for training courses. Is there a recommended one I can go on for Enpoint Manager/Intune? I've seen the Azure course, but I fear that doesn't really cover the device management I need to learn

 We've introduced a new ERP back in August. We've got Vmware Horizon VDIs (4 cores, 8GB RAM, Win Server 2016) and the employees use MS Edge to access the ERP. Everything worked great until now, now some of them are having major performance issues when scrolling/clicking through the webclient. It doesn't crash, but the entire browser becomes unresponsive for 8-10 seconds. Same result with Chrome and Firefox. The majority has Teams, Outlook, a few Excel sheets, a few Chrome tabs and MS Edge open, which uses around 30% CPU and 60% RAM altogether.
 I tested it on the local thinclient browser and it runs fine there, so the problem only seems to persists on the VDIs.

 So, my first job is to sort those spreadsheets into something manageable. I've no experience managing this much equipment and objects, so no idea where to start - my background is developer/opportunistic devops/dogs body, so it's not like it's particularly daunting for me.
 For what it's worth, Zabbix is installed and actually appears to up to date and useful, so it's not so much monitoring that I'm looking for as it is management.

 Curently fax's are fowarded from [copier@ourcompany.com](mailto:copier@ourcompany.com) and sent to all staff emails. These emails have a basic subject line which I can edit "our company ltd" and have an attached pdf of what was sent through. The naming of the pdf is randomly generated and no sender info is available in the body of the email.
 Currently faxs are not printed, only forwarder to all of the team.
 It is very difficult to find older fax emails as there is no way to search by specific sender email or phone. (I think they are all coming in via fax # but have no way to confirm.
 I feel there is a check box somewhere in admin settings I am missing or not understanding that could apply sender info to fwd'd email somehow.
 Any help appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone suggest why an MSI unattended installation (using msiexec /i) would work when the installer files are copied locally, but not when they're on a network drive?
  
The installer uses files external to the MSI.
 The MSI contains a copy of 7z.exe which it extracts to a folder under %TEMP% and uses to extract the external files (they are .wxi.7z files in an Installer.Components folder).
 I've already tried setting the FilterAdministratorToken registry setting in case it was to do with that, but that had no effect.
 The MSI was made using the WIX installer toolset.
 I tried doing caspol.exe -q -machine -addgroup 1 -url file://Z:/* FullTrust -name "Z Drive" as WIX is apparently a .NET application and may need extra permissions to be able to access network drives, but this did not fix the issue.
 I tried doing a Process Monitor capture to see if I could identify what was wrong, but nothing popped out at me.
 The installer log file contains the errors "Error. Failed to attach console to process. Error Code: 5. Error. 7z.exe returned exit code: 0"
  
Because the install files are large (total is around 24GB), I don't want to have to copy them locally onto machines I need to deploy this app on.

 I have two users (so far) in my org who are not receiving MFA push notification for Microsoft Authenticator. Both have iPhone running iOS 16. Both previously worked up until a few days ago, but now have suddenly stopped working. Here is what I have tried/tested.
  
Checked iPhone notifications are enabled for Microsoft Authenticator app. They are.
 Checked iPhone is not in 'do-not-disturb' or other Focus Mode. Other app notifications are being received.
 In AAD portal, forced user to re-register MFA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm supporting a number of mobile users working in locations that have LTE and 5G coverage. We're using some consumer-grade tethering hotspots with a stipulation that users connect to the corp VPN when using it. They're mostly fine when coupled with EU data-roaming SIMs, but setup is manual and we have no policy control so the system isn't scaling well and we can't debug issues. 
 What I'd like is something that's still a small, rechargeable device, but that offers enterprise niceties such as:
  
Dual SIM (Not essential, but it can help in some edge cases)
 Management portal with signal and usage metrics and connection logs.
 Simple L3 controls. (At least so I can force users to connect to our full-tunnel VPN)
  
If you're familiar with the Cradlepoint ecosystem, then basically this, but with a smaller, battery-powered chassis.

 My colleague who does not work on this project anymore, created the CA infra on my domain. For some testing purposes he created multiple certs for both the root and the intermediate servers. 
 I would like to sanitize this config, so only the current and valid cert is visible. 
 On Certificate Authority app I right click the server at the top of the tree, Properties, and on the General tab there are 2 CA certificates for my intermediate server. I revoked (from the root) the one which I don't need, published the CRL, deleted this cert (backed up previously) from the intermediate server itself (cert store), but on this list it is still visible.
 Is there a way to delete from this list? Or is that enough what I have done?
 Thank you!

 I have a migration of a server containing all the backup copies of our VMs via a hardware RAID, and I am looking for information on the feasibility of the trick.
 Currently I have an HP DLXXX G8 with 12 SATA LFF, and I have a DLXXX G9, with the correct slots, and a P840 which is fine.
 My seller more or less told me this: "Normally, you move the disks, and the RAID is automatically recognized, and it starts again", I find it hard to believe that it will go so well, however, I do not have the technical possibility of moving all the content to another storage (no space available, no financial means to buy 12 LFF of 8 TB , we are a very small company). 
 Have you ever had the experience, it goes well in general? Thanks in advance :D

 Is it good idea to put all DB servers in one VLAN, A by All App server in other VLAN ? In this case, if a function has one DB server and VLAN is assigned with /24 then its a waste of addresses.
 or
 Do you separate each DB and App servers by function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/networking
 Looking for some feedback on something. We have had a dev come to us - asking for access to pcap driver for sniffing traffic to locate certain devices.
 My initial reaction to this was a hard no - as I was always taught this was a very bad thing to do. With the risk of intercepting unencrypted data such as passwords etc.
 In today's world - would you consider this as much of a risk? My personal thoughts are:
  
L2 boundaries (such as VLAN with SVI) will limit what can be easily sniffed.
 plaintext data is a risk no matter what (should be wrapped or encryption).
 purely talking about sniffing of packets, not any other related attacks, the risks are minimal if everything is encrypted?
  
edit: I should mention my recommendation was for scanning the ip-ranges instead (as this would also allow for situations where devices are in another l3 network). You could pre-populate with the ip range of the adapter used for the scan.

 I’d love to get some advice from the community and get some pointers on where I can take my career. I’ve worked at a MSP for about 2 years and for the last 5 years I’ve worked for school district where I’m the lone systems and network administrator. I’m fully in charge of maintaining and upgrading about 100 switches and 400 access points, mix of Meraki and Cisco across 11 sites. About 5000 users in total. For the network end I’ve implemented and swapped out access layer switches, implemented a basic single area OSPF, setup vlans/port security/BYOD network/etc., maintain a wireless network and troubleshoot various problems that come up. 
 As for the systems side of it. I’m also in charge of managing and upgrading servers. I’ve done multiple domain controller upgrades, file server migrations, NPS servers, DHCP, Print, Hyper-V upgrades/deployments, Image creation from Windows 7 to Windows 11. 
 I’ve also been point person on several projects, some with outside vendor and some internal. 
 My question to the community is, I feel I have a very good picture of IT from a big picture but I would love to become a more advanced network engineer and climb up the salary rank. Where can I take my next step to really speed up the learning process? I’ve done MSP work before but feel they always get bogged down with lower tier busy work and are very cookie cutter from my experience. 
 I’ve got my degree and in the midst of attaining my CCNP. Any advice? Any recommended industries?

I feel confident configuring a network but if someone sat me down and asked me to design a network for a college or enterprise business I'd have no idea where to start.
 Besides getting a networking job(soon, fingers crossed) are there any good resources where I can learn about network designs at a high level? Not so much ones concerned with the minutia of network configurations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bit of a weird issue with a new deployment of a 9800 controller and capwap AP's. I had seen the occasional iPhone have an IP DHCP learning failure and not really causing huge concerns nobody was really yelling about it but was getting a little concerned as we move close to doing a mass deployment of a major building. It turns out from looking through some forums and then my own config I hadn't actually had the DHCP helper addresses on the SVI in question on the controller.
 Here's my problem, I don't know how any of the devices were getting thcp if there was no relay address configured. The only thing I can think is in the WLAN config I did have the IP of the DHCP server entered, but that's different than the helper address. So I'm a bit stumped as to why it ever worked, also why iOS seems to be the only operating system that felt any impact.

 I've got memtest, sure fine, but I'd love a tool which just thrashes the whole machine, bloody thoroughly.
 We have a lot of staff turnover, so machines go from old user to new user, often.
 We have a fleet of identical hardware with identical SOE yet the odd machine will die on users, apparently. I'd really like to thoroughly test the machines before handing to staff.
 I can run memtest, I can run prime95 but is there anything bootable? Even some kind of intense linux benchmarking suite would be fine? I just want to 'fire and forget' - come back to a machine 8 hours later and see if it passed or not.
 Anyone got something even close to this?

 ​
 At my current employer, the engineer before me configured each switch weird. On the switches; the first 24 ports are for the Data Vlan and the next 24 ports are for the Voice Vlan. The issue is computers and IP phones are connected to random ports - which then makes a lot of computers and IP phones on the wrong vlan.
 ​
 What is an easy way of cleaning this up? Only way I can think of is going to each port and assigning the correct vlan. Is this the correct way to do it?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

We simply used the Schannel registry method to disable strong mapping, but we'd like to fix the issue properly. The doc below from Microsoft leaves a lot to be desired in terms of what to do with AD CS and existing cert templates. 
 It sounds like using an additional field in the Alternative Subject Name might do the trick, but should I enable that on the existing certificate template and wait for clients to auto renew, or issue a new one? Issuing a new one seems wise so it can be dished out in stages for testing, but it's unclear if the correct cert will be chosen if two exist in the user's personal store. 
 Do we also need to issue new certs for the actual NPS server?

 In my short time here, we've received several types of tickets asking for "the PC sitting over in Karen's old desk area" to be reimaged or "Frank left the company a few months ago, I have his laptop in my lower desk drawer. Can someone go grab it and image it up ASAP? His replacement starts Monday and he's going out to a customer site Monday afternoon."
 I mentioned to my boss this seems out of the ordinary and he insisted it's always been this way and he'd rather have the end user's departments responsible for managing their inventory than it falling onto us. Consequently, there are HPs, Dells, Lenovo, Microsoft and Asus desktop & laptops out there due to departments making the decision on what they want to purchase.
 Is there anyone else out there in a similar situation? If so, how do you make it work? My gut reaction is to push for this to be changed, but I'm so new and not sure if I want to rock the boat quite yet.

 Years ago, i would open a support request, get a response in 6-24 hours, work with a 1st tier support, get escalated once or twice, then work with someone that really knew the product, or watch as the person i was working with gave KVM control to some mythical support tier person that would identify an issue and return a fix. It could be AD, Exchange, windows server, etc. It was slow, but as long as your persisted, you would eventually get to someone that could fix your issue.
 In the last few years though, something has changed. I get passed between queues. I get told to make changes that take services offline. Simple things like "the cloud shell button works everywhere but in the exchange admin web console" gets passed around until i get an obviously thoughtless response of i ..."need to have a subscription to Exchange to use the cloud shell."
 This extended beyond cloud services. I've had a number of tickets for other microsoft products that get no where. I've received calls from support personnel angry that i would agree to close a ticket that has not been fixed. I get someone calling me at 4am to work on a low-priority issue that ive' requested email communication.

Then that leaves what to do with the other 50 PST's from former employees that are sitting there not being accessed?

 One of our sites is having an issue where external calls are occasionally getting static. It doesn't happen every time nor with every phone, but they get it consistently enough that it seems to be on our end. Looking at some of the calls they have reported on in Mitel Connect Director, there seems to be a correlation of either a high MOL, high delay, or both with these calls, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this further, mainly because the site uses our organizations main PRIs and no one else has reported any issues with static. We had some issues with one of our PRI recently that were resolved, and I was hoping that might also resolve this, but the problem has persisted now for over a month. 
 Is packet capturing the way to go? Are there any other methods to troubleshooting I should try or common causes for poor delay or MOL? Jitter has notably been perfectly fine across all the troublesome calls.

 Is there any way I can fix this screw up ? Any links or suggestions welcome .
 I didn’t screw up the other ASR 9010s,I just went to each user and changed password instead of deleting and recreating a user to give them a password .
 P.s we don’t have Cisco tac access anymore because we are about to handover the devices .Some political bull shit

 Some recent projects have us with some spare (and old) equipment that is probably worth keeping for at least a little while. Our current organization system has them in a anti-static bag at the bottom of a drawer. 
 Anyone have a good suggestion for a cost effective way to organize transceivers and DAC cables? 
 For fiber patch cables we use handing folders in a portable file tote. One folder per cable length works fairly well for what we normally have on-hand. Cables have a little bit of protection, it is easy to grab and take with you and you can very quickly find the length you are looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this is a story many of you here can relate to...
 My ex-boss hired me in January of this year. He'd kept the IT dept running on a small budget while putting in the overtime and working weird hours to patch things outside of business time. He made no bones about being overworked but it was obvious he wasn't going anywhere since he'd been there for so long (at least, that's what I had assumed given his long tenure with the company - 15+ years).
 Requests for a larger budget to replace equipment and grow the IT department were universally rejected. There has only been one exception recently which was the addition of my position to the IT team. Apparently this is something my boss had been pushing for years since the company is doing really well and expanding across the board. 
 8 or 9 weeks ago some shit hit the fan, one of the higher ups spoke to my overworked boss in a way that definitely was not well received. All of this revolved around a situation that I'm sure could have been avoided with properly scaling IT to the company's growth. My boss put in his 2 week notice on the spot.
 Fast forward to today - servers are down and multiple services and network storage drives are inaccessible. There are 3 of us at the help desk with no clue how to fix it. There are plenty applicants and interviews to fill the position but I can only assume the salary offers are too low since none of the people who come through are ever heard from again.
 A large part of the company is dead in the water today. Good times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When will this be ready?
 idk, I have to research and test all the individual items, then validate them across platforms.
 Great, how long will that take?
 i.d.k; some items might take 10 minutes, others might take 3 hours to figure out. It's impossible to say. Also, this has been tertiary priority so far. We've been prioritizing patching and security issues over this.
 Ok, how soon can we deploy this?
 It's impossible to say. Would you like to prioritize this convenience item over patching and security concerns?
 Obviously patching has to come first, but when can we get this one done.
 FFS, ID-F'N-K. 
 ​
 seriously..... What am I expected to do? just quote some random bullshit time frame that I pull out of my ass on the spot? There are 60ish components in the convenience item, that have to each be individually developed, tested, verified, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure there is a name for this I just don't know what it is. Other than corporate fat.
 All the chatter recently had me thinking about this and I've been helping a farmer the past couple of weekends finish up his harvest where we are hustling all day which is a loose comparison to IT but there's no Pingpong table or game room to slip off to (this is a big company reference). (and feels good for a change of pace.)
 I was thinking about the 8 companies I've worked at over the past 22 years other than the super small companies with 1 or 2 people in the whole IT department every place I've worked at has so many wasted hours. 
 I've hired on at more than one place where they are going on about being swamped and then it's two weeks before I even get a laptop and spend half the day chatting with everyone or listening to them complain about policies. 
 Then in every place with a team of people, there have always one or two superstars and the rest are just there either doing busy work or not really doing anything. 
 Next are all the meetings, the bigger the company the more you have, and the more you just get invited to for no reason other than you replied to an email one time. Of course, there are always people who just love to take advantage of this rather than get work done. 
 I've been on both sides of it too. I worked at one place in the early 2000s where I spent six months going to quiet rooms in the building and spending the day playing Civilization V without anyone noticing or caring. I've also been the superstar who's spent a solid 30-40 hours a week getting something done. 
 This is just my opinion but overall from what I've seen in corporate America the next major recession we are going to see job reductions in IT similar to what happened to manufacturing jobs in 2008. And those job nubmers never returned to pre 2008 levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 I inherited the wonderful responsibility of having to approve new softwares to be introduced to our environment. Basically, as of now, users submit requests for new softwares to the helpdesk, and then they ask my team to review the software prior to allowing it to be installed. The only issue with this current process is that, I have exactly zero idea how other medium sized enterprises validate software. My question is two fold.
 ​
 Firstly, what information do you request from the users when they ask for a new software to be introduced to the environment. So far this is the list i've come up with.
  
1. Is there existing software that can be used
 2. Business need for software
 3. Is this for a project
 4. What is the impact if this software is not approved
 5. What specific task will get done using this software.
  
Secondly, how do you know if the software is safe to introduce? Right now, here is what I do..
  
Run the software installer through our EDR sandbox
 Check if the installation is signed
 Try installing the software on a test box
 Googling the software / the hash
  
The only issue with my current method is that a lot of times our engineers find these really niche tools from github etc that do extremely specific things. I don't have a good way of validating any of these as I can't read through the code and understand what they do in a timely fashion. That would take me several days / weeks if I did that for every software. Any advice would be great!

 What I'm not sure about is this: so inbox 1 last synced 30 minutes ago. Inbox 2 last synced yesterday at 5:54PM. Inbox 3 last synced at 2:21PM. There is still mail arriving to these inboxes, and I want to make sure that no mail get's left behind when I complete the migration and swap the MX records. Does a "final sync" run when I approve or complete the migration batch? And if not, then how do I ensure the mail in the recipient inbox is up-to-date the minute of the switch?
 The mail account domains need to be the same while the migration runs on the sending and receiving end, due to this we can't set a forward that will work. So assuming there is no way to do this "final sync" I suppose I could complete the migration batch on Thursday evening, swap their 365 accounts to .onmicrosoft.com, set up the forward from the Gmail accounts until they leave on Friday while manually sending over the few emails that may have been missed by the migration sync, change the MX, then log on and set up their profiles. Bit of a long way around it but eh there's only 5 users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, recently purchased a refurb DL380 Gen9 with the NVMe enablement kit (part no 774741-B21 which consists of a PCIe NVMe controller, drive cage with backplane and 3 PCI express cables). I installed 6 x Kingston DC1500M drives (firmware version S67F0103, no newer available) and whilst they all work, I can only get PCI express Gen 3 link speed on port 1 & 2 of the controller. The other 4 drives (port 3, 4, 5 and 6) only operate at Gen 1 link speed.
 Output in lspci with correct speed (port 1 & 2):
  LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (ok), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- 
 Output in lspci with slower speed (port 3, 4, 5, 6):
  LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- 
 Things I tried:
  
Reset BIOS: no change. There are also no options to configure link speeds.
 Move drives around: no change. It doesn't matter which drive is connected where, port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the other run at Gen 1
 Move cables around: no change
 Swap cable connections: connected port 1 & 2 to port 5 & 6 on the backplane. Still only port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the the other run at Gen 1. That rules out a backplane problem
 Swapped NVMe controller: no change
 Connect only port 5 & 6: runs at Gen 3
 Firmware upgrade of NVMe controller: was already at latest version 1.78
 All other firmware is up to date
  
So it looks like in whatever combination, I can only get 2 of the 6 drives to run at full Gen 3 speed whilst the other downgrade to Gen 1. There are some jumpers on the NVMe controller but I can't find any documentation on what they do and I doubt it's going to make a difference anway. Needless to say this quite kneecaps the performance of the NVMe drives... Anything else I can try?

The messages originated at a European MS server, so they passed SPF and therefore DMARC, but I'm wondering if the lack of a DKIM signature is expected behavior or if I need to involve MS Tech Support. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Redditors,
 I am currently facing a business requirement that is outlined in the image below:
 https://imgur.com/a/gZ76JIm
 This is a hard-set requirement from management.
 My current idea is to use L3VPN and play around with RT-Import/Export to achieve this (I am open to different suggestions as well). 
 However, I have faced the following problems so far:
  
I have to achieve this with IPv6 as well, it seems some of our equipment doesn't support 6VPE, my question is, would there be any other way to accomplish this for IPv6 in this case? 
 Looks like I can't have different VRFs for IPv4 and IPv6 in the same interface nor can have IPv6 in the main routing table while the interface is part of a VRF
 
 We have an anti-DDoS system that injects routes via BGP to modify the communities for the attacked /24s, currently, this doesn't modify the next-hop (we keep the next-hop intact) we just modify the community in order to tell the edge routers "stop all broadcasts to all transits but the scrubbing capable ones". However, being that this is going to use AF VPNv4 and VPNv6 I don't see how I can just keep the next-hop unaltered nor how I could set this up. 
 I can't just tell the network "the next-hop is the loopback of core/dist-1" like we currently do, since now the network is inside of a VRF
 Just to clarify, the anti-DDoS injects a route with a higher LPREF than the ones advertised by the core/dist switches at this moment, this causes the edge routers to prefer that one and apply policies based on the communities present on that specific one 
 
 I have also concerns about scalability, we currently have ASR1004/1006 with RP2@16GB and receive full routing tables from prov-2 and prov-1, IXP routes from prov-3 and around 50k routes from prov-4 (and this is only IPv4)
  
Our equipment is a mix of Huawei CE68XX and Cisco ASR1004/1006. 
 Any ideas, hints, or guidelines, especially if you have solved an issue like this before would be really appreciated.
 Regards,

 So the customer have 1 RDS server atm with Desktop/documents configured for Folder redirection
 Customer wants to implement a 2nd RDS server, so we will build a RDS farm with load balancing for the 2 servers and we plan to implement UDP for roaming profiles so here are my questions
 ​
 1) IF we implement UPD for every folders, should we remove the folder redirection for, or we can keep both?
 2) Since we already have local profiles on the first RDS, is it easy to implement a 2nd RDS build a farm and configure UDP, or we will have to rebuild local users folder on both servers since the C:\users will be in the UPD instead of the server itself?

But not sure if $20 an hour is enough, especially for where I live.
 I’m just not sure if I should take this position. Maybe it could be a good entry level experience for me to move up but again, I’m studying for Cyber Security and have 0 experience in the field at all. Thoughts? Should I take the position?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to find a way to scan all our mobile devices for their eSIM capability and so far I've come up empty.
 We are considering switching from physical SIM cards to eSIM but did not take note of the IDs when we received the devices. And we've got a few different iterations of devices even within the same modell (Gen1, Gen2, ..) so it isn't entirely clear to us which devices support eSIM or not.
 Scanning for regular broadband internet capability is easy enough:
  
netsh mbn show interfaces
  
And even getting information about regular SIM cards is no problem:
  
netsh mbn show read interface=*
  
But I can't find an easy way to figure out whether a device supports eSIM or not.
 Reading https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/esim-device-configuration and https://www.petervanderwoude.nl/post/configuring-esim-profiles-on-windows-devices/ lead me to believe that I somehow should be able to get at least the ICCID somehow. But the first netsh command above only returns the regular broadband adapter with no hint whether the device supports eSIM or not.
 Further reading brought me to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/mb-esim-operations and the "Hardware Lab Kit" test from Microsoft which is supposed to feature a "netsh mbn test feature=esim" test but ... this feels way out of scope (settings up a HLK server and whatnot) for something that ... I feel should be a lot simpler.
 The only way I've found so far is manually checking the broadband settings GUI of the settings app for the availability of eSIM profiles. Which is ... not great for automation.
 Does anyone have a better idea on how to scan for eSIM capability? (Preferably something PowerShell or cmd.exe (netsh) if needed. No Azure or Intune (we use SCCM).)

 This is affecting multiple servers, with different versions of windows, 2016, 2019 and 2022.

 Suspected a windows update, removed the last few and rebooted, no change, removed the backup solutions agent and rebooted, same, no change.

 As a temporary fix, I shut down the VM, removed the VHDX file from the VM settings and moved it to a different folder then re-added the file to VM settings.
 ​
 Checkpoints seem to work and the backup solution will run fine manually, but then it will eventually stop working again.
 ​
 We used to use Veeam, but this has been removed. We also have another solution installed that we were going to use but never configured. I believe this is based around Acronis, but as I said, its not running anything, just installed.
 ​
 Any suggestions?
 ​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For weeks now I have been trying to wrap my head around a problem I just can't figure out. I'll try to explain it as best as I can.
 We are providing our users with Dell Latitute computers. At the moment we have anything from 7490 to 7430, and somewhere around 5320/7420 the problems started to arise.
 We issue our users with Jabra Evolve2 65 headsets so they can participate in Skype for Business meetings (we are not allowed to use Teams, don't ask...). It all seems to be working well, until after a week or two when the users who have been issued with a new computer comes back and complains that Skype is crashing when they use the headset. If they connect the USB dongle whatever sound settings you open (be it Skype or Windows), will freeze the program. 
 I thought it was just a simple problem with Jabra, but after testing more thoroughly it turns out the problems are there for any USB sound dongle from any brand. We've tried updating the Realtek driver, and that works but only for a while once again, or just makes the Sound settings incredibly slow to navigate, not entirely frozen. Its also not universal which computers work decently with new drivers, and which will still not work.
 The problem is now big enough we can't decide on new headsets to buy, because we simply don't know if we can make them work. Are we the only ones with this issue, or has someone else found a solution to get us through this dongle hell hole?

 I'm currently trying to make a "golden" image with a virtual machine that has some basic things set up, such as microsoft office, and a few other small things we usually install.
 ​
 But in the process I wanted to see if I can make the usb installation more hands off with a unattend file, but I keep running into the issue that a product key is needed. The few things i've tried are using the windows 11/10 pro general key under the windows-setup/UserData/ProductKey, not having the point to having the point but no licesnse. But still the same error about not being able to read the <productkey> part from the answerfile.
 ​
 How do you guys usually handle this?
 ​
 I'd preferably not have a license in the unattend file, since the computers all come with pro, and I want to activate the already given license.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have experience working with dual boot pc-s, setting them up and hacking them (in the old sense of the word) but only 1 at a time. Now, I the computer science teacher became the sysadmin of the school where I teach and I should get them in shape. Now Ubuntu and Windows 10 Pro are installed and every PC has one user with admin rights (yikes!). I would like to change this.
 I have a general idea and I know that I'm capable of hacking something together but I would like to do it in a proper way, e.g. in a way which probably requires me to put in more effort in the beginning but it should then spare me headaches in the future.
 My idea in general is the following: Students should learn how to (de)install apps, use said apps + MS Office + webbrowsing, get to know the OS-s (Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu), learn the basics of fotoshop, do some programming in Python and execute them in the command line. On the other hand, it would be nice if let's say after midnight every PC would return to its original state which would prevent the students to do nasty stuff. The student would need to store everything in the cloud of on a USB-stick. The cherry on the pie would be the fact that the PC-s update themselves whenever needed. I'm thinking about maybe even creating a user for every student? But that seems a bit unnecessary, given that they can only access the PC-s in the school and not much else.
 Is there any software which already has this bundle? Or how does one achieve these goals without reinventing the wheel?

 On my laptop Dell Latitude 5410 ( with Windows 10 ) I have installed VMware Workstation Player 16 and inside it I have an AlpineLinux ( with static IP 192.168.1.114 ) with a VPNC client for company private networks . For this I use a route in windows ( route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.114 -p ).
 When I use Ethernet connection (cable) everything works fine, but when I use Wifi card/connection I can't connect to these private networks.
 The VPNC client connects to the networks and I have connectivity to the private networks from AlpineLinux but not from Windows.
 I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the network drivers (wifi and ethernet) and nothing changes.
 On that VM I use the "Bridged: Directly connected to physical network" connection.
 Thanks a lot.

 I have a problem since i'm working with windows desktop base machine and these days the windows update are actually breaking the link with the AD or Domain.
 I'd like to know if there's a possibility to disable Windows Updates "forever"/OnceForAll" with a policy in the AD. I'd like to have a group policy so nobody can't update windows or better. That no one is able to choose that option.
 I don't know if it sounds like very difficult or if there's way to deactivate for a group.
 Thanks alot in advance.
 I've been learning a lot the couple of month and I think with the redditors and community I feel motivated and please keep learning and sharing. =)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there fellow Sysadmins!
 I‘d like to have some advice on a migration/integration topic:
 I was tasked to plan the integration of the infrastructure of another company into mine.
 Both infrastructures contain an Active Directory and Azure Environment as well as Intune/Endpoint manager.
 Needless to say that I’ve never done that before – and my knowledge of Active Directory stems from my apprenticeship which was many years ago. In the meantime, I’ve worked with an IAM solution like Okta. 
 While the way the new accounts are created follow a fully automatic process,
 I wonder if there is an “easy” way to migrate all mailboxes, teams, groups, and MDM devices. All I found were guides that seem to include a huge amount of manual work – or deeper knowledge of PowerShell. There solutions might turn out to be frictionless and not that hard, but I cannot evaluate that based on my knowledge/experience.
 So, I see two ways to solve that problem:
 1) Get into the PowerShell Scrips to automate parts of the progress
 2) Search for a full featured migration tool that handles the work for me
 For the second point – of course it will be less effort, but my main concern on that topic is time. It must be done as soon as possible. 
 I am looking forward to getting some new insides into this.
 Thanks in advance for every advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 I'm looking for some guidance as a very green sysadmin. I've recently joined a new MSP as a Support Engineer. I went out to work on a VPN connection issue the other day and noticed something extremely badly configured. I suspect the reason we're having so many issues is that the clients' LAN is on a 192.168.1.x/24 subnet...the most common subnet ISP routers provide.
 I'm fairly new here, but I looked around the firewall and found a ton of NAT rules that are basically trying to get around this problem of "What happens when you're on 192.168.1.x and you try to connect via SSL VPN to LAN that is also 192.168.1.x so you can RDP into a machine " 
 Obviously, this is a bad configuration I think what needs to happen is that network needs to be on VLAN with a more corporate-friendly subnet(172.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x) but I honestly don't know where to start. No one's going to fix it without a nudge, or they might do something nutty like I've seen already and just make an interface with a 172.x.x.x IP on the firewall and NAT *Everything* through that. Where do I start with a plan to fix this network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I´m having a problem regarding a surface pro 7.
 I wanted to reinstall windows on said surface using a bootstick I prepared with Windows 10.
 I accidentally picked the wrong stick with Surface Hub OS on it.
 Since the installation is the same as a normal Win10 installation I ran through it and noticed that I installed Surface Hub OS on my Surface Pro 7,
 Now I tried to get rid of it in the following ways:
  
Win10 Bootstick
 LinuxLive Bootstick
 Surface Reset Stick with Serial Number
 Surface Hub Reset Stick with Serial Number (from a real Surface hub because the Surface Pro 7 isn´t a Surface Hub)
 Resetting the UEFI firmware
  
Everything I tried didn´t work.
 When trying to boot from USB it either kicks me back to BIOS or it just boots up SurfaceHub.
 Since the UEFI firmware reset it gives a red line on the bootscreen but it kicks me back to BIOS though.
 I don´t know what to do since MS Professionals recommend booting from a Win10 stick *facepalm*
 I hope someone can help.
 PS: I already heard someone say "just get the ssd out and partition it on another device" but since it´s a surface and I don´t want any soldering action I don´t want to try that.

 I have a private laptop (Dell Inspiron 7391 2-in-1) and a work Laptop (HP Elitebook). Both notebooks support thunderbolt. I have 1 monitor (Lenovo Thinkvision), 1 mouse, 1 keyboard, 1 headset and a external harddrive. 
  
I am looking for a compatible docking station for both laptops and my periphery devices. Something I can just connect one laptop, and then pull out and connect the other laptop (one at a time). I have been looking at the Targus 190 and the Dell WD 19TBS. 
 I was also wondering can you hook up a KVM switch to a docking station? So that you can just switch between the computers with a press of a button? If no, can you hook up a KVM switch to a monitor? I have the UGREEN USB 3.0 Switch - but it somehow doesn't hook up my monitor.

 Thanks for your help - sorry if these questions are a bit "dumb".

I followed this guide when I was installing Ubuntu (part from "If you cannot disable or unplug the disk with Windows 10", also the same thing is said here), i.e. I installed Ubuntu, turned off some flags on Windows, installed Grub on Ubuntu and turned back on flag on Windows. Now I can choose when booting: windows or ubuntu. Now I want to move my windows to m2 ssd. So my question is, how do I correctly install now Windows so I won't lose my Ubuntu installation? Because it says when installing windows is doing something that will break the boot and it will see only Windows as loading option or something like this. Both Windows and Ubuntu were installed on GPT with UEFI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I got a question but I feel like I first have to explain the background a little bit: I have a customer with very specific requests. They need a system of 4 client and 2 server machines (will all be Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022) together with some additional network hardware (NAS, printers). The special thing is that this small network will run completely isolated and will not be connected to WAN or any other networks (for a fact I'm planning on physically plugging non used LAN ports on all devices). They need an AD running but only with generic users (Factory User, Storage User and so on) and no personal users. One of the servers will function as a Domain Controller. And They need that exact same system running on several different sites across the country. Like it has to be exactly the same, down to every single AD user.
 So since the the setup will be identical on all sites and not connected to the outside whatsoever, I had the idea to set this up in my lab one time, configure it to the customers likes and then just take images from every machine. If then the order for a site arrives, I could just use my specific images to prepare the machines. I've done it like that before but never with an AD involved, hence my questions. Oh and we use Symantec Ghost for imaging, if that matters. So here my questions:
  
Can you think of anything arguing against cloning AD machines, for example a Domain Controller?
 When I clone all machines after they are added to the AD and then restore these images on other machines, will they be added properly to the new site's AD (since the hostnames get cloned as well) or will this be spotty? I could join them to the AD manually for each site if need be, but it would increase the workload.
 Overall thoughts / input on my plan?
  
Thanks in advance and have a nice week.

The offline one is completely dead everything locked which is wiped and reinstall. The other one my employee unplugged when it was "being infected" so only around 40% files locked. Personally i suspect its from phishing email or something, Our IT consultant (external, with us for about 10 years) says they could have somehow found out network vulnerability and hacked us. (which i find unbelievable). And he suggest us to upgrade both the servers and buy some other anti virus and such. amounting to around USD 10k each. (im not from US).
 I personally dont see how this can prevent the same thing to happen next time, but i do agree one of the server is quite old so could do some upgrade. just looking at other options here.
 i have read about synology or NAS or cloud stuff, in fact anything is welcomed as im not an IT guy. we have around 15 employees, max 20, usually all need to use the printers, server files and programme concurrently.

 One adom is in 5.4 version, with fortigates (6.0.9). According to one engineer they had some issues when performing upgrade, so want to delete the specific 5.4 adom before upgrading, and add back the Fortigates after upgrade.
 I'm not very familiar with FMG, but was thinking about creating a new 6.0 adom and moving the devices there (or even the root adom) instead of deleting. Would that work? Also, what happens to the policy packages? Will they be moved along or do we have to move manually? Would moving policies from 5.4 adom to 6.0 adom screw with the objects?

If I'm on the Downstream switches network ssh is good across all devices. All svi's are pingable anywhere though. I can't change the Downstream switches physical ip's because of the amount of devices assigned.

 Hoping for a bit of help with this one as it's driving me crazy.
 I've got a handful of users whose laptop intermittenly will boot them off wifi, and take 1-3 minutes to be able to rejoin a wifi network. 
 This only occurs on the corporate network at the office, only on windows 11 computers (But not to all windows 11 computers).
 Wifi setup is some older Meraki mr18's (I know I want them upgraded, but budgets). I've been unable to replicate this on my own device.
 Wifi drivers are at latest, devices are 1-3 year old dell latitudes, win 11 at latest version.
 The only error that might be related that I can find in the logs is the below:
 The server could not bind to the transport \Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{7579EFB6-7F3D-4D48-B802-A9E2614865D9} because another computer on the network has the same name. The server could not start. 
 They seem to think that another device has the same hostname as them (Despite this 100% not being the case).
 No errors on the DHCP server.
 Issue does not appear when the laptops are connected to other external networks, IE Home, the coffee shop, etc
 I have been pulling my hair out about this for weeks and the best available on google is "It's a non issue it doesn't mean anything", "Turn off power saving on the device" (Didn't work), and other similar inneffective fixes. 
 I would love a second set of eyes, thanks in advance guys!

I saw some suggestions that disabling all the privacy/security features on the phones may resolve the issue, but it is not a great look to ask users to kneecap their own device security because we can't be bothered to fix our configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So, long story short, I just started re-modeling network for one of customers and the problem is I need to put 12U of hardware to 9U cabinet…
 The easiest solution would be obviously to replace current cabinets with proper ones but as always there’s a caveat. They all are “build in” the walls. Recessed about 30cm and welded directly to metal construction of the building.
 Replacing them would be extremely difficult and expensive and would include painting all 4 offices…
 So my “standard” setup for each of them is
 24 port patch panel for fiber
 48 port patch panel for CCTV
 Two or three 48 port patch panels for regular network jacks 
 Aggregation switch for fiber that’s linking all 4 buildings and for all others switches from the cabinet
 Separate cctv switch that has its own fiber uplink to the main server room 
 Two or three switches for regular network 
 2U NVR for CCTV
 2U UPS also for CCTV
 it’s minimum of 12 and in the biggest building 14U
 Just writing that I realized that I could move all NVRs to the main server room, I don’t like having all eggs in one basket but that is kind of not much of a choice situation. But this is still at best 1U or 2U above my rack size.
 In all of that “desperation” I started thinking that maybe I could somehow secure UPS outside, to the bottom of the rack cabinet? OMG

 Any suggestions on where to learn to better troubleshoot these technologies? 
 - For example where to learn more about DNAC cli commands.
 - Or a recent ticket Ive worked on was some kind of kubernetes error when trying to add the 3rd cluster in a brand new dnac deployment. 
 - Another type of ticket we often get at my job is ISE guest portal issues which are a lot and almost always requires deep inspection of APs and WLC tech support as well.

I followed Microsoft's documentation and met all the specified requirements, but encountered a bug which prevented me from using Connect-IPPSSession.
 When running the command with a known-working app and certificate, I was given the modern auth user signing dialog. This didn't happen with the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet. 
 After some frustration, I finally found a recent stackexchange post which described this issue, and provided a workaround. 
 The issue appears to be that the module assumes the existence of an environment variable that only exists in Powershell Core. The workaround is to manually provide that value in your script by adding this:
 $Global:IsWindows = $true
 I'm not sure how to report this bug to the correct team at Microsoft. It was reported in the Powershell github, but closed there.

I will be likely implementing an MSSP in the next few months, but expect I will likely will want to supplement with my own logging platform for non-security related purposes. I don't want to have to change the configuration throughout my environment if I decide to add a second destination or change MSSPs. I would like to have a single point of aggregation and distribution for my logs. 
 It appears using Windows Event Forwarder for my Windows systems and a syslog-ng system for everything else might work, but in both cases, it seems like there might be real-world issues as platforms may misinterpret the source for all events as being the two forwarders.
 Everything I find on this topic seems to be cover centralizing at one point, but nothing about then forwarding again. Maybe there is a good reason?

 I have a dual boot setup with 2 separate drives, as well as a storage drive. I would like to isolate the other main drive and storage drive from the current Windows 11 installation and set up a Local Group Policy to prevent drive attribute changes.
 I'm aware that it is possible to add a policy to prevent a user from accessing a drive in My Computer but the policy states that:
  
Also, this policy setting does not prevent users from using programs to access these drives or their contents. And, it does not prevent users from using the Disk Management snap-in to view or change drive characteristics. I'm also aware that an administrator can reverse these changes but I'm trying to make it difficult for a user without administrative rights to change these conditions.
  
Can someone help me please? Thank you.

This led me to write a book about it when many of the most common problems are addressed. As the introduction already implies, it is fairly impossible to cover all aspects of the entire linux storage stack, as the storage ecosystem is vast. Nevertheless, I do think it covers a lot of what you might/will encounter in your daily work.

 There are my experiencies:

Last year I upgraded a stack with 3 members from 2.5.5.47 to 2.5.8.15. I uploaded the new fw via WebGui then rebooted the switch stack. After that the network is gone on these switches.
 The problem was that the switch config is modified during the upgrade. All settings on TenGigabitEhternet port is gone. Meanwhile I had problem with the switch password. I couldn't login with my previously used password, so I had to do a Password Recovery via console cable.

It doesent have to be fast, even 100mbit would be plenty since its just for the internet connection. Its a 70m run and i need to put it into the same conduit as the cables running from the solar panels to the power inverter. My first thought was to use a fiber optic cable, but i'd rather use cat 5e since its cheaper. Im going to connect the cable to a telekom speedport smart 4. 
 My questions now are:
  
Will the solar panel cables cause any interference, even if i use a shielded cable?
 Will i need to boost the signal with a switch or something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im struggling to identify beat solution for mass deploying applications to 600+ workstations that have a complicated installer with multiple dependancies. - for instance applications that as tied to cloud per-user licensing and vendor's own app manager (Adobe Creative Cloud, Avid Link etc) What's worse is that some of those apps not only have own app manager as pre-requisite, but also require additional components (drivers, anti-piracy/anti-tampering agents, bask-end licensing services) that will not get installed if running a silent install.
 I can't find any clear guidance anywhere on how to mass deploy this..
 full disk Imaging is a potential solution but creates problems elsewhere in the chain. 
 Anyone have experience with mass deploy of such applications ?

 And the biggest flag this company is a scam is their product is exams. That's what they do, sell exams. They've managed to convince people entering the field their "vendor neutral" certificate somehow adds value to a candidates resume. 
 Folks starting out in IT, don't waste your money on these certs. They are grossly overpriced, they provide little value, and if you are wanting certs there are many vendor certs much cheaper that provides better value.

 When someone logs in with an alias and tries to access the farm they get the error attached here.
 What I checked:
  
It happens randomly to people in the domain.
 
There are some that work great for them and some that work for him.
 
 In terms of comparisons between computers, I compared hardware, software, operating systems, versions, etc.
  
I checked logs on RDS itself and on the broker server.
  
The broker servers work in HA configuration.
  
I checked the correct settings of the alias.
 
I dug each and every post on Google and various forums!
 
 ​
 Facts about the environment:
 All 2019 operating systems, the most advanced versions of Windows 10.
 Defaulttsvurl is the alias definition in the RDS environment, and it worked fine until this issue occurred.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help because I can't quite find myself anymore.
 Thanks!

 I have used both Akamai and Cloudflare on previous companies. Both of which basically did the job of hiding our origin, and also the basics in filtering traffic and some caching (with various success).
 In this case the only requirement is that the WAF service is operated by a European based company. The rest is probably more like, work with what you get. Since I don't expect the same type of services like Cloudflare where i can easily hook up an existing Terraform provider have the automation done within a few hours.

The company has used PRTG for many years and there has never been a single app owner so it has accumulated a lot of garbage and there has been no standard ever put in place. This includes older servers using different SNMP strings, random WMI sensors, local users and groups in PRTG, etc. I am wanting to completely remodel our system and give it the attention it needs. I am also attempting to do this without too much monitoring downtime and effort. My question is though, how would other recommend setting up data center monitoring? Should I break it into folders like servers, networking, environmental. Then break it down into domain controllers, specific app, firewalls, switches, UPS, ATS, Genset, etc. Or should I break it down into different VLANs/Networks so I can use the auto discover feature?

 What is other peoples recommendations when administrating a tool like this?

 We did note there is a vent on the top of the chassis but find it hard to believe this is related to cooling since the server is designed to be rack mounted on top of other servers without any spacing.
 This has caused some political issues with our site guys who are now insisting we space them out by 1RU which kinda defeats the purpose of purchasing a high density 1RU solution. Might as well go DL380 which is 2RU and get the extra storage capacity, but we want 1RU because our bottleneck is CPU cores.
 Anyone had any similar experience with these servers? HPE support were less than helpful lets just say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey nice people out here
 IDk exactly if this question is off topic or not but making it simple , here it goes like : 
 My company is running Cisco anyconnect servers + OpenConnect servers on some specific URLs with load balancing and different managements which non of them is making me a problem other than the network my clients are sitting in and the problem is that :
 I have multiple clients sitting behind a firewall that doesn't let them have access to OC/CA servers of that company on that specific port and URL but There is an other client(server) in this network that can pass this firewall without any problem and I can run my own domain on this client So the question will simply be what Kind of hardware or software do I need on that specific client to make a bridge into company's servers without extra routing, encryption/decryption and SSL certification ? Is HAProxy capable of doing this ? Do i need Remote SSL offloading ? 
 ​
 In other terms : Something like a Proxy that takes OpenConnect/Cisco requests from clients on the inside network and just forwards them to original servers without regulation ? I want Clients to not change anything other than the URL 
 ​
 And there are reasons why I want this scenario to be unchanged so please understand that I'm not looking for better ways of doing something like this but rather making this work

I moved my home to Rackspace from HM a couple years ago, when HM was having e-mail issues. I thought they had their stuff together and was going to move back. The last 3 hours has been a prolonged convo with their brain dead tech support, so maybe I'll just complete the move away from HM.
 I don't need web hosting, just DNS. But I suspect web comes with package no matter what.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm tasked with finding a UPS solution for our company's server rack. Adding up the servers' power consumption from what their PSUs are capable of I got to around 10kW. So this means with all servers at 100% load a minimum of 10kW is needed to supply enough power to keep the devices running. I figured, to be safe, I'd recommend getting UPS units totaling about 12kW to allow enough time for a graceful shutdown in case of a power outage.
 My coworker thinks this is overkill and he'd rather we get a UPS just big enough for our average daily load. It'd be more work to measure all our servers' power consumption but it'd save us money. He also believes we just need UPS to cover for power fluctuations and spikes.
 Is it feasible, if safe at all, to "skimp" on UPS like that? I'm not great at putting my thoughts on the table and my coworker has spent more time in the company than I did so if the answer to the previous question is no then I'll need convincing arguments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, there may be SOME features that VMWare still have that Proxmox VE doesn't have (and features Proxmox VE has that VMWare never will, like built-in backups). But let me tell you, for my hypervisor in my home datacentre, I have continually had value in Proxmox VE in the 10 years I've been running and upgrading it.
 I started with Proxmox VE v2.3, 2x node cluster, which has expanded over time to 3x node cluster and upgraded over the literal decade to now v7.2-11. Same cluster, upgraded in-place. Earlier versions were a touch rocky to do major version upgrades on, but documentation was there, and I was able to get it sorted.
 Over the decade I've not only had performance improvements on the same hardware, but new features, and all sorts of great things. I update with some regularity (several times per year).
 I went to take a backup of my VM and found a feature suddenly there that I didn't know I needed. "Protected". I can take backups that don't get auto-pruned by my backup task! SO AWESOME!
 Also, Proxmox VE gave me an HTML5 local console to my VMs months/years before VMWare even had it, and Proxmox VE did it so much better (so much more responsive).
 And these are just some examples.
 So, I gotta say, fuckin'eh to the Proxmox VE devs! I don't know if you read this. But I tip my hat to all involved in the Proxmox VE development ecosystem. Thanks!

 We are currently prepping our first windows 11 image for rollout via Desktop Central and are having a ton of random issues.
 After deployment the OS will not open a ton of apps (no errors and no processes start) including settings, paint, ms store, notepad to name a few. This seems to be happening across any hardware we try it on. If I try to run settings via task manager I get an 'this app is not installed' prompt. 
 I've ran SFC, DISM, with no errors found / no improvement. I can't really get to much else to try to repair the install/apps either (settings is completely dead).
 It is worth noting that the current windows 11 version we have been testing with is Enterprise 22H2. We have tried fresh installs of 22H2, upgrading from windows 10 to windows 11 and running updates, as well as updating from 21H1 to 22H2. Due to the nature of the business/our security policy we can't deploy anything below the latest MS patched device even if the latest version is unstable (yeah idk).
 Any ideas/comments?
 ​
 TLDR: Does Windows 11 Suck or do I just suck? inb4 both.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 Trying to see if we can get some feedback on a problem we are experiencing in a site we recently took on. We had this problem almost daily around September where all inbound traffic would stop while all of our VPN tunnels stay up to our other 2 sites. When this happens bandwidth at the firewall on our WNA interface and our LAN interface is both minimal, 4-5 mbps if now lower. The problem disappeared till it started again a few days ago. The ISP says something on our end is maxing out their AdTran 5660 CPU causing it to start discarding packets. I feel like I should be able to see a spike on our firewall in traffic if we are in essence almost DOSing their router. We have mostly used Cisco Meraki and Fortinet in the past so Juniper is not our strong suit but from what I can tell they seem to be setup correctly to handle broadcast storms etc., but I could be missing something. Any suggestions on where I should start looking? 
 ​
 Some background on the site:
 Fortigate 400E firewall (handling DHCP)
 Juniper EX4600 Core fiber switch 
 Mix of EX 3400 and EX2300 switches throughout the site (around 25)
 Previous admins have the site setup flat with one large subnet (/20)
 Major things running on network are around 200 Hikvision cameras and 10 or so DVRS, around 100ish IP based clocks/speakers in rooms. 
 Site is running Ruckus APs and Zone Controller.

Things were good at first but having to drive around didn't cities to provide support for 30+ sites got old even though my schedule was pretty flexible with no one to directly report to in my immediate coverage area.
 Got tired of being away from home and felt like I also hit a ceiling as far as knowledge goes. The position focused very much on hardware over software and didn't feel like I could further advance my career by staying at current company.
 Fast forward to November 1st this year. I started a new position with a different company that has more of a focus on Windows products ( Windows Server, Office products, etc). The previous IT guy they had at the company unfortunately passed away back in June from cancer. With that he also left no documentation whatsoever when it came to passwords, credentials, anything for that matter. 
 Now I'm dealing with a Windows Server that is currently running on an evaluation version because they were attacked by Ransomware back in September which caused them to restore their server without a license I guess? They are also using a combination of Google docs and Office 2016.
 I've already bright these items up to the CFO who is my direct report and I don't think he understands the sense of urgency to have these items implemented

I'm an Architecture / Engineering manager, in prior lives I've been in development, ops, infrastructure, data center, all at the same company. It's a really big environment, and I've gotten a reputation for understanding how most of it fits together.
 I've been a manager for about 3 years now, finally feel like I know what I'm doing, but mostly with a small team. I'm probably too hands on/ in the weeds, and I like to work on side projects still, but I get good feedback from my team, and boss/ peers. My team's going to double in a few weeks, and I've been a bit worried about coming off as a know-it-all, or a micromanager to the new folks. I try to be cognizant of setting a goal and letting the team figure out the best way to get there, but I definitely have opinions about how we should be building things.
 So, I guess my question is how do you prefer to interact with your boss, when they're not just the people manager? Do you like having them help figure things out, or would you rather they stay out of your way and let you come to them? Or those of you that are in this situation, how do you balance it?
 Hope that didn't come across too self centered, thanks for the consideration

 We encountered an issue where a customer was attempting to run an RFC 2544 test along a circuit we provide. The circuit will pass on all tests except for the small MTU sizes of 64 and 256. We see a drop in line rate on the throughput tests to about 750Mbps for 64 byte and 820Mbps for 256 byte.
 We are using the ASR 900 and ASR 920 routers for each end of this circuit. It’s a L2VPN point-to-point circuit designated at 1Gbps. 
 Has anyone else had any luck getting their RFC 2544 tests to pass with these routers at the lower MTU sizes? It seems like there could be a CPU limitation preventing these smaller sizes from achieving line rate throughput.
 Thanks for any help!

 Knowing that a reboot solves a problem, vs knowing WHY the reboot solves the problem.
 Any suggestions on a clearer and concise way of describing the difference?

 I’ve got an issue I run into every month with a specific server when patching. When shutting down after the monthly CU has been prepared the server sits at Getting Windows ready… for anything up to a couple of hours.
 This is the only Server that does this.
 It has the following roles 
 AD Domain Controller File Services inc. deduplication 
 The server is a hyper-v virtual machine
 When I open resource monitor on the hyper-v host I can see a lot of disk activity, but oddly it’s on the vhd that acts as the storage location for the file services on the server. 
 There is approx 4TB of data, all small files.
 Can anyone advise why the update process seems to be so interested in that location? Is this normal from others experience of large file servers?
 Any insights much appreciated.

 iam not sure if its matter where to start robocopy cmdlet.
 For example:
 Source: MS Fileserver
 Target: NetApp Volume
 Would it make a difference to start my robocopy job directly on the source server instead of an admin machine on the same network? When I start the job on my admin machine, would it be a additional hop (cache) for the files, so the copy would take longer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some level of understanding with Cisco Hyperflex. We will hopefully getting official training on it soon, but my team is being asked to take over a multi-site Hyperflex solution that was created by, well lets just call them non-IT people to be nice, and my first impression is that it wasn't built right. But they insist they followed all the Cisco recommendations. So I have some questions I'm hoping to figure out before I get called at 3am on a Saturday.
 First, the way these systems are configured is there is 6 VMware hosts, all with 6 SSDs in them, then the 7th server is the Hyperflex management server or something. Each server has a single NIC with 2 ports, 25Gbit, connected to two different switches. Those NICs are handling anything Hyperflex, VMware DRS, VMware Management, storage, and VM traffic itself. 
 Questions:
 1 - I've always gone with the school of thought that 1 single dual port NIC isn't very good for redundancy, but they insist this is the Cisco recommendation, are they really right?
 2 - I also would never shove everything through those two nics, is this also Cisco's recommendation?
 3 - The storage in VMware looks like iSCSI, but I haven't been able to get hands on. Where does the iSCSI adapters on the VMware host connect to as a SAN provider? Is it the management server? What happens when it crashes?
 4 - Is the Hyperflex storage like VSAN where there is a replication delay? if so, how long is that delay?
 5 - They told me DRS should be turned off for Hyperflex. Is that true? IF so, why?
 I guess open ended, is there any other tidbits of info you can supply me? Imagine that you are being asked to support a pair of these systems in different geographic locations, without ever seeing the damn thing ever.
 That's me

For now I will set that problem aside as I foresee a larger problem. We have another partner that has their own appliance and must be completely separate from us physically. Before we had a switch that would split that connection and let them pull down their public IP, the problem is I don't know how that's going to work in a leased line situation where they typically have a /32 for the PPPoE connection?

 ​
 What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted in on-prem DC?
 ​
 So, as we know, traffic in CDN networks is mostly outbound and the ratio can be 1:99, where only 1% are requests from the Internet to the CDN, and 99% are responses from the CDN to the Internet. On the one hand, we are obliged to use a firewall and requests from the Internet to the CDN service must pass through it. But should the return traffic go through the firewall? For example it might be possible that traffic from the Internet is only 1 Gbit/s, while outgoing traffic can reach hundreds of Gbit/s and it seems unreasonable to use firewall for outgoing traffic, because we trust our servers, plus we need a more expensive firewall. But on the other hand, if the return traffic won't pass through the firewall, the routing setup will be a bit tricky, plus we'll get asymmetric routing and so on...
 ​
 So, again:
 What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted on-prem DC?

 The end users had access to the contents on this vhdx which was mounted on one of the VMs from this ext HDD. I just can't see how that was possible considering hyper-v won't even boot a VM with this vhdx added, regardless it can't even be mounted to be explored.
 Is it possible to mount or attach a vhdx stored on a fat32 drive so we can explore the contents?

 So this week we suddenly had a load of users who all needed their account unlocked. Upon investigation what had happened was we had external attempts of multiple logins to azure ad power shell that had failed and triggered the lockout policy.
 The attempts were clearly scripted as we had hundreds in a matter of seconds, all from different countries. The logins have since died down.
 I could find a conditional access policy to specifically block Azure AD power shell but found a post where you can block all apps then allow all the apps you use. This makes me nervous so currently have it in report only mode.
 This got me thinking how easy it would be for a malicious actor to do a DOS attack on a company which could cause a real outage and if there is a true way to protect against these attacks?
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are seeing an issue with client explorer.exe processes leaking handles on our SMB servers and causing them to be overrun.
 Within a few hours of opening a session in some cases we can see handle count for explorer.exe reaching 250,000+.
 Seeing it on mostly Windows 10 but also Server 2012 R2.
 When I run handle.exe tool it just has like 200,000 entries all in the root of the share and this is often without any applications running or files being opened (i.e. the share is just mapped/user has opened a connection to it at some point)
 Thought it might be AV or Windows Updates but have temporarily disabled AV and installed latest patches but problem still occurs.
 Not sure how to investigate why explorer is just continuously opening these handles and then proceeding to not close them/letting them just pile up. Thought it was a server issue but this is happening across multiple different SMB servers/independent storage systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I upgraded a JIRA app called BigPicture on our productive environment. I'm not a professional JIRA admin, but I do 1st and 2nd Level Support aside from my main tasks.
 The company paid around 6500 $ for the license for that app.
 By default, the app creates a database dump whenever you upgrade it.
 Cool, I thought. Upgraded it with few clicks. Closed the ticket – went on with my day thinking that it worked out fine. Nope. I received an E-Mail that the entire configuration from the users was gone.
 I looked into it and, yes, all the things that they were working on were gone. Communicated the situation to my other admin colleague and to the key users. Then I tried restoring the data from the database dump. This did not work because the database scheme has been upgraded as well, and we would have to revert the app to the older version to make the restore file compatible.
 So, I went into test environment, downloaded the older version of said app, installed it, but no. It did not downgrade. Apparently you'd have to uninstall the app first and then reinstall the older version. Sure thing, so I did just that (on the test environment) and tried to restore the backup there. Failed. Nothing happened when I click on the button to restore the data. And I also cannot restore the data on the test environment as the database dump only applies to the prod environment (due to the upgrade).
 Note that this is not the first time that this happened. We've had the same issue with this app around 1 month ago, where I created a ticket. Apparently it was a bug, which then got hotfixed. (We even tested it and it worked). But now we are back to where we've been in the beginning. I reopened the ticket, and I'm still waiting for feedback.
 Got a message that this issue has been perceived very negatively, and I understand. Now they want me to get the app working ASAP or I might get fired, but there's not much I can do.
 Yikes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I’m looking to figure out an oversubscription model for our WAN locations. We have many branch locations that are fed by MPLS services with no current option to add local internet access. Our wireless is centralized and we have no appetite at this time to change to flex-connect. 
 So, knowing this, I’ve landed on a minimum bandwidth of approx 3.5Mbps per client. I haven’t nailed down the amount of clients yet but I have a method to figure that out. What I’m struggling with is how much oversubscription to go with. 2:1, 5:1, 20:1? Or any other insights you may have. This is a healthcare environment, so a large portion of our guests are transitory, but while they’re here we want a good experience. 
 Thoughts? Totally to open to suggestions. 
 Edit: sorry for spelling, grammar. Mobile sucks. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Earlier this year I shared an OpenSSL cheat sheet and it seems to have been received well by this community. I've made a few typo corrections and wanted to share the latest version.
 ==> OpenSSL Cheat Sheet v1.7 Direct Download <==
 The cheat sheet includes these commands and various flags/arguments and notes for how to use them:
  
openssl rsa
 openssl genrsa
 openssl dsa
 openssl gendsa
 openssl dsaparam
 openssl ec
 openssl ecparam
 openssl pkey
 openssl genpkey
 openssl x509
 openssl req
 openssl pkcs12
  
The most up to date version of this cheat sheet will always be available at pracnet.net/openssl, at the moment that is v1.7, so feel free to use the direct download link above. (no registration or e-mail sign ups required)
 The cheat sheet is a part of a course I teach on OpenSSL, and if you use OpenSSL for troubleshooting and inspecting SSL/TLS, you might want to consider the whole course. Since it's coming up on sale season I figured I'd also throw in 1000 free seats to the course on Udemy:
 Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/openssl-cheatsheet/?couponCode=B7B7EEF874F9D43D1AB5

I've read pros/cons using Vault, compared to another 3rd party service, especially in how it performs and for lack of some features. It seems so much easier to get Vault and administer from the same "Dashboard" though rather than another service pooling all our email and using a side vendor. I was hoping follow members, either uses a service that works with Gmail very well, or their direct Vault product and what their take is on it. Thank you for your help!

 it is some kind of a theoretical unequal-cost load-balancing question.
 Let's imagine that we have two parallel connections between two routers 400M and 700M, or any unequal M:N ratio.
 What we have now for load both connections M:N ratio (let's forget about Mice and Elephant flows).
 E.g. if we have Cisco from both sides - we have an proprietary EIGRP for this, which does an excellent job with this.
 So question - what if we have two different vendors on different sides (or one non-Cisco)? 
 What options do we have? BGP + DMZ Bandwidth Community? Static M:N routes? Do we have another non-Cisco proprietary solution for this?
 Is there anything else?
 I will be glad for detailed answers with explanations, Thanks in advance!

 I work Helpdesk for a printer company and had an interesting situation that seems to be network related.
 The printer had a static IP, .0.24. I enabled DHCP, rebooted and it grabbed a 0.250 address (no APIPA). Also confirmed they were on the same Wi-Fi as the computer. The IP would not respond to pings and the UI was not reachable but the IP could be seen in an arp -a command. The MAC matched the printer. Typically, if you cannot ping it’s either on a different network or offline completely, and with this being visible in arp, a good Wi-Fi connection status and the printer rebooted, the only thing I could think would be to reboot the router. Any thoughts on what could cause this?
 Thanks very much!

I don’t ask people for free haircuts or to come clean my house for free. Why do they think they can just call or text me with their IT problem and expect me to give them an answer? I paid money and spent a lot of time to get my certs and education. My solution to this has been to tell people, “sure, I can take a look at that. My diagnosis fee is $50. I can’t guarantee I can fix it but I will take a look and we can go from there.” I actually just got my first client like this. It was meant as more of a deterrent but I got a client. Lol. Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to see what others think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm a SrNE for a global biotech company and we've been running approximately ~2k+ C9300s spanning the globe for a few years now. Over the last 3 months we've been experiencing complete failures at a very alarming rate. We're currently running IOS-XE v17.3.5.
 Switch failures have occurred for various reasons, entailing:
 - PoE capability of switch death (Non PSU related).
 - Switches experiencing faulty boot flash requiring more RMAs.
 - Switches randomly bricking with no lights whatsoever. Just a complete and total death.
 - Switches randomly bricking and giving "BOOT FAIL W" error on console and non-recoverable. Can't even access ROMMON. Validated via Cisco bugID CSCwb57624, but not recoverable via power cycle/reload as noted in Workaround: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb57624
 Further, after our team pushed Cisco to how unacceptable this has been, they came back acknowledging a potentially faulty batch of many of our C9300s with corrupted DIMM.
 Guys... In my 15+ years of networking and having managed C3750/3850s for the majority of my career, I've never experienced or witnessed anything like this from Cisco.
 For years now, I haven't been fond of the direction Cisco has taken their Catalyst platform with moves like axing Catalyst IOS, consolidating IOS-XE to catalyst hardware, and their continued merakification of Catalyst which lacks the tight integration needed for rock-solid stability (IMO). 
 Cisco's moves have mostly felt more like cost-cutting measures than anything truly beneficial or innovative from an engineering standpoint. It's all giving me FirePower vibes which is why Palo is now dominating that market-space.
 Anyone else running C9300s in their environment at scale?
 Any failures?
 What software chain?
 I can't imagine our org is the only one experiencing this.

 I'm pretty much ahead of my class due to having been an IT nerd all my life.
 My question is, do managers/companies/colleagues care more about your knowledge or your ability to get stuff up and running.
 Tldr: Should i focus my spare time during these classes on focusing on theoretical information or actually do stuff and get it running.
 For eg we have a little project where we have to setup an AD environment. It's really basic so for fun Ive virtualized everything in proxmox, got a virtual opnsense router in there, adding a backup and monitoring server, looking to get it liked to azure somehow ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently using a NAC product that's pretty expensive. We are using it to dynamic tag VLANs based on Active Directory OU. So, if the user is in the "Monkeys" OU they get assigned to the "Monkeys" VLAN.
 Can this be done with something like NPS or FreeRadius? I've been checking documentation and I'm getting mixed signals on how easy this would be to configure with FreeRadius (seems like it doesn't play well with AD, requires Samba, etc.) and I have no experience with NPS, but the documentation seems pretty straightforward.
 Any recommendations on how to dynamically wireless users to specific VLANs via AD group/OU without paying out the ass for a NAC?

They continue on (in the ticket) to say that they have already requested access to this site, months ago, and nobody helped them. In today's ticket, they did not include the domain they needed access to.
 I looked at the ticket history and sure enough, they did submit a ticket months ago. That ticket did include a domain and at that time the tech notes on the ticket were.
  
The domain resolves and opens on a few computers that I've confirmed access on. Please confirm that you've typed the domain name/website name properly. I am keeping the ticket open for a few days, please let me know when you are available to perform further testing from your machine/location.
  
The status on the ticket was changed to 'waiting for user response', which keeps the ticket open and informs the user at least once a day that a ticket requires their attention. It does this for 5 business days then closes the ticket if there is no reply from the user or if the tech doesn't modify the ticket in some other way.
 The user ignored the notes from the first ticket that 'they put in months ago' and I'm sure this user is bad mouthing IT. 'I can't get to this site, this is dumb, I already put in a ticket, they never help me!!!'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick background first - Got about 10 years of professional networking experience but I have NEVER touched proper enterprise grade cisco equipment. EVER. Mostly worked in places that couldn't afford or didn't need all those features and a new ISP that did a Juniper/Calix combo. FINALLY started working for an employer that has the scratch for Cisco with Palo Alto for Firewall.
 TL;DR: I'm very green on what Cisco hardware can and cannot do.
 We are getting tasked with stopping users from being able to communicate directly with each other within their same subnets. They only need to communicate with specific servers and cloud services.
 With Calix, I was able to use a protocol called Mac Forced Forwarding (MFF). In conjunction with DHCP Snooping and IP Source Verification, the switches forced all traffic to the gateway where a host was assigned via DHCP. My original thought was to use this and have the PaloAlto's regulate this traffic. Well to my surprise, these catalyst switches (9200, 9300 and 2960) do not have this feature. Seems to be limited to ISP grade switches.
 I tried using Switchport Protection (Private VLAN Edge) and this worked when the workstation where on the same switch. But it allows me to communicate to other workstations on other switches. While all of my access switches do trunk back 1-to-1 to the core switches. If I put those switch's uplinks into protected status as well, I might get what I need. Still "testing" this out. 
 I'm also looking at VACLs but I haven't fully grasped the cisco mapping features yet.
 Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to tackle this requirement?

 Setup
 Firewall >> 1820-8g >> WiFi AP
 My WiFi AP has 2 SSID (VLAN 1 and VLAN 1003). All I want to do is be able to pass through both on one port to firewall but all tagged traffic is currently blocked.
 I think what I need to do is set all ports as Untagged for VLAN ID 1 and Tagged for VLAN ID 1003? This seems weird since I don't want to "tag" incoming traffic I just want it to pass through if already tagged. Is my understanding correct or should both VLAN ID be shown as Tagged?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have inherited a network where we have a single peering with an ISP using a private AS on our side. We advertise a single prefix (which we own) to them which they then advertise to the internet on our behalf.
 In RIPE, there is an empty ROA configuration where it shows the current AS numbers advertising the prefix (i.e. the ISPs AS) and we can just pick one and click to create an ROA to match. Private AS numbers do not show up here and cannot be configured as origins.
 I recently added an ROA to try and reduce the risk of a BGP hijack of our prefix. Shortly after creating the ROA, the ISP stopped accepting our prefix and of course it dropped off the internet. The ISP wasn't able to give much information as to why this happened but by removing the ROA, it came back up soon after.
 I'm assuming what happened is, the ISP had a filter on their router which looked up the ROA for our advertised prefix, saw it originating from a private AS which didn't match the ROA and then dropped it. Would that be normal behavior for an ISP? Would they not trust the private AS as they were the ones who provided it to us in the first place?
 Or is using an ROA just not possible where the originating AS is a private one?
 We do have a public AS that was recently assigned but have not started using it just yet.

Is there a reasoning for this rather than just including the ISP gateway in the provided public IPs? We usually have a firewall at the edge but when provided with this ISP set up, we have to use a router to bridge the WAN and LAN. Just wondering if there is any reason behind this configuration?

 I'm a software engineer who came from a non software background and am in that "holy shit, computers and the internet are amazing, let's understand how the world works phase." I work for an awesome company that has networking problems and even though I don't work on that part, I do want to understand it thoroughly.
 Anyways, I am looking a for a book that's basically self contained/will give me enough information that I can read it and say "ok, I know how this works and can sort of make a mental model of it in my head." I tend to read books cover to cover/work through as many problems as I can along the way.Ideally I'll only need one book.
 Current recommendations/on my list are
 - Comer, Internetworking
 - Tannenbaum's Networking textbook - Networking a top down approach

 As we can see, a lookup for rt.example.com returns the CNAME, but then doesn't "follow up" to get the IP address, even though a lookup for rt73a.ad.example.com returns the IP address.
 The context is that I currently don't want rt.example.com to be accessible over the internet but I might want that in future. Was hoping to be able to that without requiring a change of URL used to access it.
 Is DNS supposed to behave how it's behaving for me, or is there some setting I need to change to get the behaviour I want?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previous post was deleted for being "low quality". Maybe because it only had a single question? IDK. But I'd like to hear opinions and stories from fellow network professionals about what they've experienced during their careers as far as RIFs/layoffs go. Especially with the large RIFs big tech companies are going through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are replacing the old DCs in our organisation for cyber security which has made us create new print servers. All the printers are installed and work from the servers in the configuration we want, using dns for port names etc.
 Now because of print nightmare we are trying a work around to install the printer drivers via intune and then a login script to map the printers after the drivers are installed.
 Here comes the issue, we have noticed that all of the printers with v4 drivers are being installed with MS point and print driver. The printer with v3 drivers are installing with their appropriate drivers.
 We have found that some of the V4 drivers are not installing, so adding that to the driver install script, removing and re-running the login mapping script, it still adds the printers with point and print. 2 of these are for the main office and need user preferences enabled so they can select trays etc. But point and print doesn't enable that. Without that we cannot shut off the old DCs.
 Now we don't want to disable the print nightmare registry key or amend it to a state where it is not 1 as this will be picked up in the cyber security audit in March 2023. I am at a loss as to what I can do to bypass this issue. It seems odd that all websites on the Internet state V4 is the answer to fixing it but V4 is causing the problem.
 At the moment we cannot move to a driverless system as we need to get new printer contracts first.
 TLDR; printers with V4 drivers are shown installed with point and print and is not suitable for our environment.

AppLocker is set to block anything to do with OneDrive, however it keeps getting reinstalled during every monthly patch. As far as I know, its not a requirement for any other apps and we have already been blocking it for a few month. 
 What this ends up doing is making is users constantly see "blocked by admin" and error messages. This does not effect functionality but it causes an uproar from users.
 My suggested solution is to disable OneDrive usage via Group policy but actually "allow OneDrive" via AppLocker to prevent these messages. 
 Is there anything Security/STIG related that makes my idea sound like a bad one? For reference this is the policy I want to enable.
 https://admx.help/?Category=Windows_10_2016&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.OneDrive::PreventOnedriveFileSync
 Any and all input would be great regarding your organization, file storage, or just security guidelines in general. I do have the OneDrive V2R2 STIGS as well. But I wasn't sure if there are any other overarching guidelines I am missing out on.

 Was wondering if anyone on this forum could shed a light on a strange issue I'm seeing on a network. 
 I have a VRF (all configured correctly as reachability to other subnet across the MPLS are reachable fine) presented on a port facing a host (windows laptop) the IP facing this host is:
 192.168.0.1/24 
 The host laptop is on:
 192.168.0.2/24
 I can ping the laptop fine sourcing the gateway interface on the router and the host can ping the gateway, however it is unable to ping other hosts inside the VRF on other sites (the laptop can ping the gateway to these other sites just nothing sat behind the gateway). 
 To remove any possibility of it being an MPLS issue I created a loopback interface on the router where the above 192.168.0.0/24 subnet sits: 
 Loopback100
 10.10.10.10/32 
 I still cannot ping the host 192.168.0.5 sourcing this loopback. I instantly assumed the host default gateway was wrong as I could ping directly connected but no further, however the hosts address/subnet mask and default gateway are 100% correct.
 ​
 Was wondering if anyone had a similar issue, the router is question is a Cisco ISR 1100.

 I have tried running various powershell commands to uninstall then reinstall appx packages, copying over the SystemApps folder from a working server, deleting the shell experience folder from appdata for all users, exporting appx registry keys from a working server, and deleting and recreating profiles.
 The only thing that works is the command listed above, and that's only temporary. 
 I'd appreciate any ideas on this one, I think I've exhausted google.

 If a windows server is still required for SolidWorks, I also need a dc for authentication, right? I wish I wouldn't have to keep the DC...Do you guys have any tips or recommendation for that kind of scenario?
 Thank you very much for the help !

 I'm not versed in the ways of the sysadmin but i have to work with daily users fixing little and larger stuff (Helpdesk).
 I like my job but i don't know what to do anymore for a specific individual. 
 This person is paranoid, delusional and thinks the entire world is following her and changing stuff behind her back.
 It started years ago, she claimed her skype account got hacked multiple times, she couldn't reset the password since she never got the reset mails.
 Turns out her recovery address was a gmail address and she never cleaned that up so the mailbox was full.
 She doesn't want to clean it up so she can never reset any service she claims has been blocked or hacked that is connected to her gmail address.
 This person does not accept nor want to hear any rational explanation.
 She claims all her phones, laptops (private and work) are being monitored and things "change" the next time she logs on to any device.
 For years we ran scans with antivirus, antimalwares etc ... nothing is ever found except some harmless cookies.
 We can never verify if anything she claims is true since the "present situation" cannot be compared to the "previous situation" since all files are always locally on her laptop or at home or anywhere else where we have no backups.
 Finally we got her to place some documents on our internal network drives with the specific question to only follow what happens to these files while she works on them. (She really didn't want to put them on the network) This way at least i can look into the backups to see what has changed. But even that doesn't prove anything.
 What would you do so you could "prove" that either she changed something or at least see what changed and by whom ?
 This person can tie you up for hours and days complaining we don't do enough to find the culprit on her work pc and i don't know anymore what i could do to help her.

 Further to my post about using Azure/365 non licensed users. I am wondering if there is also a 3rd party provider that can link to various identity providers to be the single source of identity so we can then point SSO/Saml config from the various saas provders instead of azure.
 A comment has been made, that they want to keep out tenant as clean as possible, eg only users with licenses and have access to company resources and equipment to reduce risk. This will likely be 300 users in next few years. But overall staff could be 5000+. Of the 5000+ , they wont have email acct, nor equipment but do need access to like HR Saas portals etc.
 Personally, I think its going to be cheaper to just give everyone a basic 365 license that inc some form of email and can control the MFA part of the identity provider. But business wants alternatives as they know as soon as I enable email, I will be going, headocount, headcount (not that I said I can turn the email part off).
 I am thinking like of Okta etc but wanted ot ask here first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at other threads on here about other VPN hardware providers and I've heard a general concensus of Cisco anyconnect and Palo's global protect. As being great options 
 There's only a few concerns/requirements I'm looking for.
  
Pre-windows login auth to domain servers for new user authentication
 Saved credentials that can be used with said pre-windows login
 And multiple gateway options for fail over to redundant ISPs
  
For requirement #1,2 we have a few branch offices with a decent amount of turn over so new users are always signing in and out of the domain'd pc so a saved set of VPN credentials that user's can't see and don't need to be reentered for an employee to authenticate to the DC to is a must
 We currently use Watchguard fireboxes with IPsec clients as they allow prelogin auth with saved creditials, but my only gripe is that the VPN client doesn't allow for multiple gateway options with out making a new profile, that users have to swap to and sign in again on. (The VPN client has to swap gateways on its own as I don't trust my users to toggle to the back up, and to toggle back to the primary when connection is stable again.) 
 I'm hesitant at the Cisco option as I don't have much Cisco CLI expertise.
 We have about 25-35 VPN endpoints at any given time. 
 We are a full windows org and only IT uses VPN on phones (mainly to just test if the VPN connection is working)

 I have found that i need to identify and exclude any onedrive shortcuts in all users onedrives as well as:
 1 prevent them being moved via robocopy (we are lifting and shifting all onedrive content into a "documents" folder for each user)
 2 prevent any files being moved from users homedrives going in to any onedrive shortcuts folders, this is to prevent personal files being uploaded to SP or a Teams SP site. (Happened in testing...)
 Currently I have a robocopy to do a move (it's more complex than this example) :
 Onedrive root -> Onedrive\Documents Hdrive -> onedrive\Documents
 Issue being folders are merged and onedrive shortcuts will upload content to whatever sites they are part of.
 This is a task set out as we can not use the provided onedrive migration tools due to some clash with known folder redirection and pther issues that i wasnt part of initially. 
 Any ideas? Or am I over complicating things.
 I have created a complicated powershell script so far that does alot of prechecks (network,diskspace,homedrive space required, etc) but this actual lift and shift part just gets more complicated when I look into the nitty grity bits.

Since i’m relying on Aruba to host my customer websites and email server (talking about imap/pop ofc), i would like to move to a vps to increase the income and to simplify my management work. I started looking at OVH but i need a “lot” of storage because my customers want a lot of GB per email address and on OVH to obtain more than 160gb i need to pay for the 8core/8gb ram vps that i don’t need (i can’t consider the option to add a secondary partition because cpanel can’t officially store email on another partition). So i started looking at A2Hosting, the “Lift 16 Vps” makes more sense for me since it has 450gb storage so i can fulfill the customer needings about email capacity. The exchange server is not a viable option due to costs. I would like to hear opinions about a2hosting, if someone has better ideas than mine and if cpanel has some sort of problems on multi-hosting that i didn’t consider. Thanks in advice

 I am working as an MSP for Small Businesses (<10 employees). None of our Customers have Services that are available through port forwarding nor do they use VPN connections. They have a proper professional Endpoint Security Solution (with Firewall) installed on every device.
 Now to my question: Does it make sense to deploy a "Next-Gen Firewall" into their network? I don't really see any benefit they would get out of an expensive Firewall compared to say a small MikroTik Router doing NAT (properly configured of course, VLANS etc.) . I heard that all those fancy things like Deep Packet inspection come with their own Downsides that i would rather not deal with. (And my Endpoint Security Solution supposedly does the same thing but right on every device with little to no configuration)
 Do you think the added Security weighs out the cost of buying, monitoring and maintaining a Firewall for such a business?
 I personally would think the money is better spent on awareness trainings for the employees than on such a device. 
 What are your thoughts?

 I created a policy which is called Print Nightmare, but it did not work and I needed to seach it by myself. 
 Other problem that happened is that if I installed the printer first in one user the error 0x000002e4 comes up, but if I login with Admin and install it, and then login with the user and install it, there is no error. 
 Is anyway that I can install in the server and automaticly the printer shows up by itself ? 
 I do not know if I explained it well.

 I want to test my Samsung SATA drives since some of them cause trouble when recording large video files over time, causing drop frames. Seems to be due to the SSD not being able to keep up the pace. I know the usual suspects like Samsung Macigian, Crystal Disk, Smartmontools, etc. 
 But it seems none of them gives me a comfortable way of dealing with slowly degrading disks of different types and vendors. Do I really have to go into the specific SMART attributes and check on the significance of each one of them, also having to monitor them changing over time? 
 For ex. my not so good old 840 Pro (256GB) passes all tests and currently gives me 56 CRC errors and 5216 wear leveling count. I also suspect that any kind of bad sector checks also don't really work with SSDs as they trim the bad cells away!?

 If not then does anyone have any suggestions how to identify the traffic across a multi vender OS estate? I would've considered a GPO to tag it with the correct tag if it was an all Windows estate but since MAC and Android are involved to, I was hoping Teams already pre tagged in traffic.
 We use Meraki MR46 access points and there is no option to build a custom rule based on source ip address annoyingly to as I know Teams has a predefined source port range it uses across the board

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm looking at implementing wireless QOS across our wireless estate.
 With this mainly comes the need to prioritise Microsoft Teams traffic over anything else first and foremost.
 I have read a few Meraki and 3rd party posts/blogs on setting it up with no real answer to this question...
 Do the default rules (or custom ones for that matter) shape traffic themselves on the AP's or are they only a means of tagging certain traffic with the correct QoS tag?
 The reason I think the AP's might arrange traffic and shape it themselves is because the option to "Shape this traffic" is there on the default and custom rules to.
 I haven't really been able to find an answer to this.
 Our link speed bandwidth across this new site we are building is more than enough! But since there are going to be a lot of people wirelessly "hot desking", wireless will be even more prioritised than wired. With that comes a need to make sure all the AP's prioritise traffic such as Teams (mainly) etc... over others like YouTube etc... 
 If the default rules do shape traffic on the AP's into low/high priority queues behind the scenes then they will be enough for what I'm looking for here given that the default tags from Meraki seem to be correct across the board for things like VOIP and Teams etc...

Usually we test circuits and such with iperf, but I was thinking it may be useful to setup a html5 speed test server on each of our datacenters that users and clients could be directed to with a url link. Opera would still be used for when we need to test isolated links. But for initial testing, it would be much easier than walking clients through iperf. 
 This isn't something I want internet facing or anything, just for internal testing to our datacenters. 
 Has any one set something up like this in an enterprise setting? I see open speed test as an open source solution. But curious about potential security concerns because we would have to get it past security obviously. 
 Just looking to see if others have done something like this and what recommendations people may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone else or just me? The amount of trouble and drama that these cause me is unreal at times. Absolutely hate the things!
 In an environment where your place cannot ship goods without the printed labels, it is a bit of a showstopper!
 We use Zebra printers at site, quite a number of them, printing various labels from SAP, so they often have to be specific printers for each label type. These are types such as 110Xi4's, 220Xi4's, ZD500's and ZT610's. 
 A long while back, I made some suggestions around purchasing maintenance for them but this cost and idea wasn't being entertained. So at the time, looked at purchase a spare of each printer type so in the event of failure, we can roll out a new printer immediately, minimising disruption and downtime. We went with this idea and knowing it could be months before replacement printer would arrive as lead times are about 3 months now. Obviously this was long ago now and spare is in use. 
 So today, printer seems to have a mechanical fault, is out of warranty and Zebra don't really want to know. I'd sent them a video displaying fault and they now recognise it as being mechanical fault and needs a visit, but they ask me to contact a partner for this!
 Being the only IT guy about the place, this ultimately falls to me. I'm an IT guy yes, but I am not a printer engineer. We have our limits but it doesn't half stress me out when these things go down.
 It honestly felt as though I was doing same thing over and over again with the printer and expecting a different result. I also find printers the most mundane sort of things to be dealing with which I suppose doesn't help!

My HR Dept is tasking me with reaching out to the termed employee and coordinating the return of equipment. I dont feel like it should be IT's responsibility. I do believe that I should provide the list of equipment but not be the means of recovering it. I am curious on everyone's thoughts and what procedures you all might have in place for this.
 Edit: I would like to thank everyone for your feedback. A little more background here, small IT Dept, I am a lone Sysadmin with one tech support rep. We have a company of about 225 employees and I report directly to the COO. I posted here because I keep getting put in situations of having to deal first hand with termed employees. And of recent I was put in a situation to meet up with a termed employee at our offices on a Saturday when no one is there. I have drawn the line here and documented my concerns in an email to HR and management. Thanks for the reassurance that I am making the right decision here stepping up to management.

 Server is PowerEdge R540 128 GB Memory / Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz 
 Client has about 7 VMs being ran on this span of 3 hard drives. Fortunately all together the total amount of data being used is just a bit over 1 TB and we have Offsite backups running. Client doesn't know this yet. 
 I want to look into getting a hard RAID Controller for the server and get RAID setup. Should I go for a RAID 5 and move the DATA off the D: Drive to the unused Disk on DISK 5? Or setup the server to do have a RAID 10 configuration for the DATA Drive?
 Also it bothers me that the OS is just sitting on a single drive with no redundancy as well. I was thinking of doing a RAID 1 for that.
 How would you go through and handle this issue and prevent as minimum downtime as possible to get this s*** fixed?

 We have recently bought Dell switches with OS10, configuration is pretty easy with VLT and I find it easier to manage as well. But our Dell Account Manager pushed us to install SONIC OS in the switches and I found almost very few documentations online and almost no documented best practices. (I had to reach out to Dell Technical team to find out that MCLAG Keepalive is not possible when the Management port is mgmt vrf)
 How was your experience in deploying Dell with SONIC?

 I am using an old switch to practice a few things on first, so that I dont screw up production.
 So with that said, I pulled an old Dell N2024P switch out of the closet, flashed the latest firmware, and did the following which seems to have worked in terms of setting up a management VLAN. What I did:
  
Add VLAN 10 called "Mgmt"
 Assigned IP address 10.11.10.6 /24 to the VLAN 10 interface.
 Removed the IP address from the default VLAN 1 interface
 Marked ports 1-23 untagged VLAN 1, marked port 24 untagged VLAN 10.
  
So with that, I now can only access the management interface for the switch by plugging into port 24 and assigning a 10.11.10.X /24 IP to my network adapter. Great, this is fun…]]></summary>

Obviously NBAR and some traffic shaping would be an easy fix but I’m convinced our company leadership has compromising photos of our department head and when the higher ups complain about the quality of their video stream, he will pass the problem onto us to implement some sort of solution.
 Currently our internet link utilization averages around 75-80% and we just use QoS to ensure critical traffic is guaranteed bandwidth when there is congestion. Increasing the capacity of our pipe isn’t an option and we’ve tried for years to alter our network acceptable use policy(people LOVE to buy switches on amazon and plug it into both wall jacks in their office). 
 Any recommendation regarding how I can manage this upcoming problem? I’m assuming that we’re not the only team with this issue particularly South Americans who also have to deal with the time difference and beloved sporting event happening during work hours.

 Is this viable? Or would it be seen in a negative light by employers, having all these "career breaks"? The way some people make it sound is if there is a 1-month gap in your resume, questions start being asked. 
 I appreciate any feedback! I feel like I need a change from the normal work lifestyle of indefinite mon-fri 10 hour days for the next 30 years until I retire. Contracting seems like it could be a good way to keep things fresh, experience different infrastructures and learn new skills. And generally seems to be better pay, I'd likely earn the same if not more even with the time off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 One of the company I work for would like to test some chassis before deployment. They can recover some parts from a partner venture (ISP) before purchase a batch of those.
 Initial config would go as follow:
 ASR-9006-AC-V2 (2 fans, 3 pwrs both V2)
 2x A9K-RSP880-LT-SE
 2x A9K-8X100GE-SE
 Beside common BGP, OSPF they need to be capable of :
  
Multicast Routing Protocols (PIM, IGMP)
 Security package (SSH, SSL)
 SSO-NSF, FHRP, LACP, BFD
 MPLS (Traffic Engineering, Layer 3 VPN including VRFs, RSVP, EVCs, Layer2VPN, EVPN)
  
For what I can read online, I don't understand what difference is between A9K-RSP880-LT-SE and A9K-RSP880-SE is there any limitation to the LT version?
 Also I can read that we would need to buy some licensing for VRF which is this A9K-800G-AIP-SE.
 Is there anything else that would be required in order to make this work?
 Obviously I could go and ask Cisco but I already know I would only receive a explainer with a BOM for ASR99XX which we are not interested in currently.
 If anyone is an expert, I would glady listen to advice.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping for some guidance here in regard to a wireless implementation. Side Note: I'm fairly new to wireless.
 The implementation is across two physical Locations where one is a giant freezer and the other is an Ambient Warehouse. The AP's in each area are in their own AP Group and Flexconnect Group. 
 The issue right now is when handheld devices are in the Freezer they have no signal.
 From what I can tell when testing signal on site. My laptop stays connected to the Ambient Warehouse when inside the Freezer. All the strongest signals I see when standing in the freezer are from the Ambient Warehouse AP's and very bad signal from some of the AP's in the Freezer.
 The AP's in each area are different models. C9115AXI-E and AIR-CAP1532E-A-K9. A 3rd party designed and configured this solution, and I am lining them up for a troubleshooting session.
 ​
 Has anyone got any recommendation on what I need to be looking at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, first post on here but I have utilized this subs info for quite some time.
 To paint the general picture. I recently started a new position and found myself needing to assign some of our available static IPs for new security cameras that were being installed. This led me to the IP spreadsheet that the company utilizes. I know that this is not uncommon, but I have never encountered one so inaccurate/outdated. A few basic NMAP scans showed just how bad it is.. but not to derail, I got approval to begin purging and updating the spreadsheets.
 My current process (only testing atm, I have not begun updating the spreadsheet) is an NMAP scan: nmap -sn -PR and: nmap -sn -PS. I also run a scan through the IP Address Management tool in the Solarwinds toolkit that the company utilizes. Finally, I will ping the IP from the local switch itself (if applicable).
 I know this technique is redundant and most likely not the most effective method. Thus, before I begin, I was hoping to gather any suggestions or techniques that others may use to ensure that an IP address is not in use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an FYI post. For the last 2-3 weeks we have been having intermittent flapping of connectivity within our Meraki AutoVPN network. We have 4 offices in a mesh topology. The event logs on our MX firewall would show entries for 'VPN Tunnel Connectivity Change' and 'connectivity: false' while specifying the peer losing connectivity. It seemed to happen on the hour, and last about 5 minutes. Ping attempts during that time would timeout between offices. However, normal internet access was not affected - only the VPN tunnels. So what was the cause? After working with a couple of engineers at Meraki support, some suggested firmware upgrades and rollbacks (to no avail), we requested an escalation of the issue. After some analysis on their end, they discovered that the VPN Registry servers we were using were very busy. They changed our primary and secondary VPN registry servers. Since then, no more issues. Hoping this post will save someone some time in the future.

My DNS is a CName: Audotdiscover that leads to autodiscover.outlook.com. 
 How do I change these settings globally? Should I change this? Is this even a problem? Do you have additional resources/information? I know OWA is unreachable, and that might be causing some of this problem. 
 Thank you for any information you can help with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. Im trying to improve roaming capabilities of clients inside a massive cinderblock building of concrete. The equipment we are running is as follows
 AIR-CT5520-K9
 Mix of Cisco 3800/9120 APs.
 I was looking at the WLC and saw a few potential settings to modify to improve client connectivity. The building itself has a pretty good density of APs (over 90) and we do not want to or think adding more is the correct solution to fighting concrete everywhere.
  
Want to change client roaming aggressiveness under Wireless ----> 802.11a/n/ac/ax to a minimum RRSI threshold of -80.
 Changing RF profiles specifically for this building.
  
Any thoughts or tips you guys have used in the past for this type of environment?

 We have all Dells and some desperately needed updates, this script does that and even changes the bios password if a existing one is already applied. Obviously this can all be changed to fit your needs.
 The regkey adds and take aways in the scripts are because that how we know if something is install or found in intune.
 This also takes away Dell bloatware. All in all im proud of it, took a while to fine tune it but it can always be improved. Just thought Id share.
 There is a Install, Uninstall, and detection script so it wont install on machines that arent Dells.

 The image below is a screenshot and results from the command prompt. The left command prompt is run as a domain user. the command prompt on the right is run as a local user. The local user is getting an System error 5 occurred Access is denied.. Does anyone know of any group policy objects or ways to get a local user to successfully request information from the domain controller? example

 This application consists of a database which resides on a Win 2019 Std server with an associated service which facilitates client's access to said database. Users have a client application which is installed on their Win 10 Pro machines which is used to access the database residing on the server.
 Both the server-side application and the client-side application would need to be isolated.
 Does anyone know of a solution I could use to facilitate this?

Now, it seems, in the corporate space, due to the appeal of Microsoft's vast product suite, most companies have moved or will be moving to Microsoft 365. Question: Is this setup healthy? This might be exaggeration, but in years to come, since all data will be housed and managed by one company (Microsoft), will we even need the SMTP protocol?

Their main SSL certificate expired 4 days ago. Tried to create an account to reduce the amount of captchas to fill for unblocking while handling a range of IPs that seems to have gotten a few IPs blacklisted there for some reason, the confirmation email required to activate the account never arrives (which makes sense if they use the certificate on their SMTP, providers would likely reject email from a server with an expired cert). And when using their contact form to let them know i get the very helpful response of:
  
An Error Occurred!
 Error:
  
And nothing else. 
 So, if anyone has an alternative way to nudge those people to go and fix their SSL, please do so. In the meanwhile i guess it's captchas time...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On all our administrative GUIs (VMware vCenter, Storage Systems, Back-up solutions, SAN management, iDRACs, Container Environment), we configure AD authentication together with basic (local) authentication. This basic authentication is used as a 'workaround' in case AD would be unaccessible, or someone messes up the AD binding, or makes a change on AD level.
 While there are already cases where we had to use the local user, it poses a huge security risk since these are static credentials and there is no policy in place to rotate them. 
 How do you guys approach this? I'm aware Microsoft doesn't recommend password rotation anymore and instead advices to use MFA together with long/complex passwords. I assume this is not possible with basic authentication? Would you disable basic authentication completely? What happened where you than were lock-out because of an underlying AD issue?

 as it is now I log in as a standard user to my desktop. For any type of desktop elevation I need to perform, I use my la_first initial last name account. If I need to log into the file server for example, I use my ja_first initial last name account to log into any server BUT the file server and jump to the file server using admin share to do what I need to do. Create a folder, permissions, etc. 
 So that’s 3 accounts I have. Well my boss has only recently started practicing separation of duties and we are looking at ways we can standardize this for both of us. I’ve just been recently promoted to a Jr. Sys admin and am going to be given more access to servers. 
 How do you handle this in your org?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just wasted an entire morning understanding why a static source directory was apparently changing files, only to realise Robocopy may be reporting the summary wrong.
 Each time I run a threaded command like...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /MT:32 /Z 
 ... on the same location I get a summary report each time with differing file counts and sizes.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 547 547 0 0 0 Files : 1353316 0 1353513 0 0 0 Bytes : 699.840 g 0 700.014 g 0 0 0 Times : 0:00:09 0:00:00 0:00:00 0:00:09 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 547 383 0 0 0 Files : 1356866 501237 855802 0 0 0 Bytes : 693.333 g 34.89 m 693.693 g 0 0 0 Times : 12:12:38 0:39:56 0:00:00 0:02:27 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 547 547 0 0 0 Files : 1353619 0 1353787 0 0 0 Bytes : 698.507 g 0 698.686 g 0 0 0 Times : 0:00:36 0:00:00 0:00:00 0:00:36 
 ​
 But running it standard (without the threaded switch)...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /Z 
 ...I get the same, correct result every time.
 ​
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 0 547 0 0 0 Files : 1370293 0 1370293 0 0 0 Bytes : 707.611 g 0 707.611 g 0 0 0 Times : 0:08:38 0:00:00 0:00:00 0:08:38 
 The threaded command copies the files fine (when I check manually), but I need to prove the results after and the summary suggests an incomplete copy.
 The threaded command is wicked fast compared to the normal way, but I'm having to run a slow /L after the fact just to prove the file counts match.
 ​
 Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just doing something wrong?

I am peering with my RP via bgp on the edge of my network, a direct connect, that router is configured to accept multicast now but due to an oddity I have a switch next. So it is foreign RP, router, switch1, firewall, switch2, multicast clients.
 For the switch1 how would you all handle it? Would you turn on layer 3 and route multicast between the router and firewall or just extend a vlan between the two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there anyone here who has experience using Snipe-IT that can advise on its capability for tracking a large volume of repairs and RMAs?
 For a Little context, we currently use an out dated system that was developed in house to manage movement of assets(we provide retailers with IT hardware and often install loan equipment while we repair or obtain replacement equipment for the customer). We recently won a contract to distribute specialized network switches nationally but the catch is that we now directly take over the warranties and our current system is not suitable for the now large amount of RMAs we have to process and track. I have been asked to evaluate Snipe-IT as an alternative system before we spend a small fortune developing new Asset Management Software.
 I have played around with the demo and while It will easily address most of our needs the only way I can see us using it to track assets that have come back for an RMA is by creating a new status or duplicating a location and adding a suffix (example, having "Location A" and "Location A-RMA area"). However, due to their high volume, we want to treat the faulty switches as an entirely separate beast, in order to make end of month reporting easier.

 I face an issue in my network environment, the detail is as following:
 We have 2 ISP with the IP's (example) below :
 ISP 1: 103.45.24.0/24
 ISP 2: 203.17.25.0/24
 ​
 here is our brief environment: https://ibb.co/gv36xDx
 ​
 There is requirement from my manager whether is it possible, if we have app publish to internet where if the IP public from ISP 1 (103.45.24.0/24) - dnat to - Web Server is down or fail then the IP (103.45.24.0/24) failover to ISP 2. Otherwise, if IP Public ISP 2 down or fail then the IP failover to ISP 1 ?
 ​
 I have searched and still looking for anything about BGP who explain this explicitly but still have no clue how to configure it.
 ​
 I have basic knowledge in networking and make use GNS3 for lab and prove of concept before going into production.
 ​
 If there is a paid course or anything in particular or video tutorial that i can follow.
 I would like to take and pay for it.
 ​
 Really appreciate anyone who look into this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to keep this as tl;dr as possible.
 ​
 We have a few hundred notebooks and (Mini-)PCs in our company, and a few months ago it seems Microsoft introduced a (or a few) very, VERY annoying bug(s) when it comes to mainly DisplayPort connected screens... things still worked pretty much without issues, so I (we) suspect a random Windows Update as the culprit by this point.
 ​
 People have called many, MANY times by now about (but not only) ...
 ... flickering displays
 ... screens that randomly turn black mid working, yet Windows still sees them as connected so it suddenly becomes a "ghost display"
 ... random colors flickering
 ... screens not waking up once it went into Standby
 ... weird resolution issues when using Display to DVI adapters
 ... and so on...
 ​
 I am... really at my end here and so is the rest of our IT team. This doesn't just happen on notebooks, this also happens on Mini- and normal full size PCs, it doesn't matter what graphics card even. This happens on Intel... NVidia... AMD... and so far this almost exclusively is happening on DisplayPort connected screens. Almost all of those displays don't have HDMI tho, or if they have most of the Docking Stations only have one HDMI out.
 So yeah, just a little rant about this...

 As in title, I am fighting those pesky MS Store apps. I removed MS Store from my "golden image" however user is still able to install apps that are present in Start Menu, Messengers and alike. I do not have InTune, I work with Pro versions of Windows. Anybody is able to point me in the right direction? What I want to achieve is to prevent users from downloading/installing those apps.

(It was on my list of things to check but didn't get to it in time.) No biggie, they're renewed. Start popping them on everything that uses them. But I've never used/managed ADFS before, nor MS Dynamics 365 CRM. I walk through MS documents, get the certs setup for ADFS and get the Relying Party Trusts working again. I get certs renewed in the 365 Deployment Manager. Updated the CRM IIS bindings.
 I now get the login screen, and it logs in, but fails with: 
  
Error Details: ID4175: The issuer of the security token was not recognized by the IssuerNameRegistry. To accept security tokens from this issuer configure the IssuerNameRegistry to return a valid name for this issuer.
  
I don't have cert thumprints in my web.config and as far as I can tell, everything is running the new cert. But it definitely isn't, because something is failing. I've been googling and reading for the past day and haven't figured it out. Any tips would be appreciated. If you help me figure it out, I'll send you a local craft beer or donate to an animal shelter. Your pick :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty experienced with Varnish and VCL (sysadmin 2 years), but this seems to be an uncommon case because of a couple of factors.
 I have a new hitch/varnish server running as a remote caching proxy serving a node.js backend halfway across the Internet. The backend is serving HTTP on 9801 but is also serving websockets on port 3000. A user visiting the site enters the domain https://foo.com, gets taken to the varnish box and views the site, where the site javascript then tells it to connect to websockets on wss://foo.tld:3000, but it can't connect. There are lots of solutions for setups where varnish is running on the same localhost as the backend that it's serving, but this one seems to be a problem. My VCL includes the standard req.http.upgrade -> return pipe with the connect headers copied, and it worked with our previous frontend proxy that was on a different CDN, and I suspect the old CDN was playing a part in making the websocket connections work.
 How do I get varnish to pick up the client connection for WSS on 3000 and pass it transparently back and forth to a remote backend that is running WS also on 3000? There's so many possible factors at play that I'm a bit lost. All replies appreciated.

 Now, he has some Ethernet-capable CNC machines and a monitoring device (from Chatter), and the monitoring service told him to set up VLANs. So, he asked me to set up VLANs.
 I go out, set up VLANs as follows:
  
192.168.10.0/24 -> VLAN 0 (default, original)
 192.168.20.0/24 -> VLAN 20 for CNCs
 192.168.30.0/24 -> VLAN 30 for Wifi
  
For the machines, we set static IPs since he uploads designs to the machines via FTP and he types in the IP address directly. Fine, good.
 I set the CNCs' static IPs as:
  
192.168.20.11 (later)
 192.168.20.12
  
VLAN 20 DHCP range is 192.168.20.101 to 192.168.20.200 to reserve the lower range for static IPs.

 So I pass CCNA last year in January which been sitting on collecting dust since I been focus on RHCSA which finally passed yesterday. So I realize I should look into ways on how to renew it. I think Continuing education credits would be the quickest but also going for CCNP would work as well.
 with the later however, it meant to go more in depth on networking which would be interesting. only problem why I'm a little hesitant is from a Odem book I had some time ago certain topics in the early chapter mention technology which was cisco exclusive. I mean that expected since its is Cisco lol, but reason CCNA get respect is that it try to stay as foundational as possible.
 So I want to ask anyone who made a jump to 301 to ENCORE (which I gather the most congruent pathway) just how similar are they in term of concepts. like a 20% differences, & if so are said differences more Cisco's exclusives protocols and such?
 P.S if anyone know where to find learning material which just touch the new stuff. pretty please let I know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently come into the position of being the IT admin for a small video company with existing IT infrastructure and could use some help recovering a VPN that’s stopped working some time in the last 2 weeks. Now when trying to connect — all our VPN clients run macOS Ventura or Monterey — I instantly receive the following error message:
  
VPN Connection
 The L2TP-VPN server did not respond. Try reconnecting. If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator.
  
I’ve observed the same error message on both macOS versions mentioned.
 The public IP doesn’t respond to ping — which I know doesn’t necessarily mean anything other than all the ports on the router are stealthed, which is fine from a security standpoint — although all other network resources (authentication, NAS access, internet access from the inside) are working just fine.
 The network runs on:
  
A Ubiquiti UniFi USG-PRO-4 firewall
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Switch 48 US-48-500W PoE switch
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Key Gen 2 UCK-62 controller
 A Dell PowerEdge T320 running Windows Server 2012
  
I reached out to the previous IT guy, but he’s incommunicado. Then I found some Windows Server updates pending … those’ll get installed tonight.
 Any help, even diagnosing from first steps would be greatly appreciated!

My team would like to monitor for number of connections, system / site performance, etc, for our locally hosted server and it looks like any number of tools out there will work though there doesn't seem to be any recent information or opinions from real Sys Admins.
 And so here I am, asking this community for your thoughts, feelings, experiences with the multitude of products out there. I don't have any preferences (paid vs. open source, etc); I'm just genuinely interested in your reviews and recommendations before diving into any number of free trials and getting talked up by sales folks.
 Thanks in advance. Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in my current role nearly 10 years, and to be honest for the most part I really enjoy it. They've been pretty lacking in pay raises and bonuses though, and when a former colleague set me up with an interview, I took it - my first interview in 10 years.
 It went well, and they made me an offer which is nearly 35% above my current salary. Obviously it's an incredible offer, and I'm delighted to get it. My boss says that he wants to make me a similar offer, but it's going through the quagmire of the company HR department and nothing concrete has materialised after about a week. The new company needs to know by the end of this week whether I'm accepting.
 Not counting new job fear (in which I hope I'm not alone, and everyone here has from time to time!), the big thing for me is that company policy says I'd need to be in the office at least 2 days a week. I currently do the majority of drop offs and pick ups for my little girl (who's 3), which is possible due to my WFH schedule. The commute to the new job would be about 40 minutes each way, so days that I worked, I wouldn't be able to do the nursery run.
 My new prospective boss says that in his team, he's super open to being flexible with WFH, so it may not even be this much. I'm just.... Hesitant. I know that it's because of my WFH lifestyle that I'm used to - I guess I'm just wondering, how do I get over this fear? Have any of you made a similar transition?

 Well mister, you might want to contact your auditor and state that 'indeed: we do not backup our most important financial data'. I got it al written down and escalated to my manager. I know that backups are required in this sector but the client itself apparently does not. My lord it's only wednesday and I need a drink.

 Currently have a small network with a single ISP line. We are adding another ISP with matching address space. Our address spaces are from the provider and are too small to advertise with BGP. 
 Outbound traffic seems pretty easy and lots of options with FHRP/track objects/route maps/etc but was wondering about inbound traffic. We have an authoritative DNS server being hosted on-prem. Wondering if I could add multiple glue records with each provider's address and have multiple host records to allow inbound traffic to failover.
 Also wondering the pros/cons of using VRRP vs track objects and a floating static route. Have labbed the scenario just having a floating static on the main provider tied to a track object and having the secondary provider router inject a default route into OSPF. If the primary goes down then the static will be replaced by the OSPF learned route.

We have no security posture and whenever I mention security it is treated like it’s working against the company. As with many companies security is an after thought which is then ignored. As I have a life I’ve stopped working late to support the company because I need to have a work life a balance. 
 Development of course has many people many devops engineers but there is no infosec, CTO, CIO, Tech lead or anyone of the sort.
 P.S I know quitting is a good move considering I care more about the company than the owners but I want to see if I can find a way to get a managerial promotion and if I can save this ship. I’ll probably be leaving anyways.

 From what I see, we have a black (Multi Mode?) run that runs underground into each building. From there it goes into a beige box with multiple jacks. The beige junction box then connects to a Fast Ethernet Bridge using a Fiber Patch Cable.
 I'm not sure if you can tell from the picture but I'm pretty sure I need a MultiMode SFP Module for both of my switches. Any clarification\correction on the correct module would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: How do you use REST APIs to improve your monitoring abilities?
  
With the increase of focus on DevOps has led to performing many actions and automated tasks with APIs! You can write a script that performs actions on a device or group of devices, and make intelligent decisions based on the CRUD responses. 
 What about for network monitoring? API calls to devices can obtain much of the same information, if not more detailed information than SNMP MIBs can get - but how could they be worked into an operations environment? 
 Most environments, mine included, have a number of monitoring tools. We use a combination of SolarWinds, DNA centre, Intermapper, and a few other methods. These systems poll devices every second (or several seconds) for new data. This is no different than the request/response format which would occur for API calls. 
  
 Are there tools built to utilize API calls to network devices? 
  Have any of you ever built a custom web application specifically to display their desired information in specific ways? I'm not an application or web developer by any means, so I can't speak to the complexity for a task like this, but I'm more looking into the need for something like this if there are existing commercial tools that do this already.

 In my company, we are supporting many remote office locations. A common complaint is to see that wireless or wired network speeds are slow (most engineers will be familiar with same). 
 Just wondering, what tools/apps you use to document and test network speeds in a global network environment?
 I am thinking of a way to benchmark network performance. i.e get an onsite contact to run a series of test on LAN/WLAN etc and to document the results versus what the expected results should be.
 This can then be used as the benchmark when future issues are raised to help understand if the speeds are compromised, links saturated or other IT issue etc
 Any suggestions on tools or similar processes or any thoughts in general?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, feeling kinda dumb on this one and I figured this would be the right place to ask a quick question.
 Does anyone know of a set of Visio stencils (preferably vendor-agnostic) containing pretty much all conceivable switch sizes - 8, 12, 16, and so on - with anchor points on each port? 
 I'm putting together some Visio diagrams of an existing network we'll be taking over. It's an absolute rat's nest, and we're likely going to tear it all out regardless.. but I'd like to write an as-built that encapsulates Layer 1, and review it with outgoing IT to make sure our cutover plan captures everything.
 edit: Guys, respectfully, I'm not looking for pointers on network documentation. This is a unique situation necessitating this visualization, and I'm just asking if anyone's aware of a stencil set that might help accommodate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we are planning a business continuity test. We have two sites. In the primary site we have two DC's, in the secondary site we have one DC. IPSEC tunnel between the two sites. 
 The scenario is a disaster happens at the primary site. Everybody needs to login at the secondary site. (different FW, different VPN). We disable the IPSEC tunnel and we disable the FW policies between the two sites to simulate the disaster at the primary site. Everything works and is tested.
 I was just wondering what would happen when the DC in the secondary site can't reach the DC's in the primary site and vice versa. What would happen if there are some actions to be done at the DC in the secondary site during the business continuity test, like password resets, GPO changes etc. Will the changes sync without issues to the DC's at the primary site when the connection is restored? Not planning on doing modifications though, just in case. 
 No Active Directory Sites & Services configured, I know, it's on the todo list :)

        <updated>2022-11-16T14:07:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 I am having an issue with my native VLAN assignment for some reason and I am not sure why. I am very new to Aruba but worked with Cisco for a few years and most recently Alcatel-Lucent (unfortunately). The issue that I seem to be having is that at my branch location I have a newly deployed Aruba 6100 that sits in the IDF and connects via SM fiber back to the MDF. I have been using VLAN 100 for my native VLAN and my networking equipment all lives in that subnet. On the MDF side, I have my VLAN assignments set up like this
 BR-44-MDF> show vlan members port 1/1/49
 vlan type status
 100 default forwarding
 112 qtagged forwarding
 164 qtagged forwarding
 184 qtagged forwarding
 188 qtagged forwarding
 601 qtagged forwarding
 When I set my native VLAN on the Aruba switch trunk to match the MDF I lose connection to the switch and have to wait for the checkpoint to revert my changes back to the native VLAN being 1 before I can access the switch again. My trunk interface on the Aruba side is set up with 
 Native VLAN: 1
 Allowed VLAN List: 1,100,112,164,188
 I also noticed that the Aruba switch VLAN 1 is pulling a DHCP address in the same subnet as my VLAN 100 address which surprised me that it didn't throw an error for overlapping subnets. 
 BR-44-IDF# show ip interface brief
 Interface IP Address Interface Status
 vlan1 10.1.94.21/25up/up
 vlan100 10.1.94.125/25up/up
 I am not sure if I am missing something silly that I need to do in order to stop this behavior and have the VLAN 100 act as the native VLAN with a static IP instead of VLAN 1 with its DHCP-assigned IP. Any help in finding the piece I am missing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have been looking into upgrading our systems from RC4 encryption to AES-256. The first time I turned it on it broke everything. DC's couldn't talk to each other at all. It was my first truly oh shit moment. Took down the company for 3 hours. Today I got sometime to go back and start looking at the issue . The password for the krbtgt account has not been reset in about 8 years. When I run the klist command it shows AES-256 connection from and to every machine I have looked at. The only exceptions is the krbtgt and our QNAP device. QNAP will be something I look at afterwards. We have an old one and are talking about replacing it the first of the year so I don't want to spend too much time there. Anyhow, my thinking is it is still using RC4 because that was the last time the account had its password reset and to move it up to AES-256 the password needs to be reset. 
 ​
 Can anyone confirm if my thinking is right?
 I've been told by multiple people that resetting the password for the krbtgt account has not caused any problems. Has anyone had any issues with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we recently bought a lot of different laptops. All brand new medium range dell/hp/lenovo.
 Some came with a usb c charger, others with the standard 19v brick. We had 2 very similar hp models with the only difference being the size but one came with a usb-c charger and the other one didn't. 
 Why? Why are they still using custom 19v chargers when all of them are capable of charging through usb-c... 
 Sorry for this rant. It just annoys me that i need to have 10 different spares instead of a single standardised one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, i'm a sysadmin at a big healthcare provider in the UK. 
 Our tools are showing "brute force attack" alerts because thousands of accounts in AD are being locked out. And i'm talking sometimes a dozen lockouts per account per day. 
 But here's the kicker - we have no login failures. So there are no failed logins at all for 99% of the affected accounts. 
 We have no idea what is triggering the account lockouts. The source of the account lockouts is showing a web server we use for the website, so we were considering whether its AD-integrated web server which is causing the issue, but its also showing thousands of account lockouts originating from dozens of other assets/servers in the network. 
 We have a decent sized team looking at it but we're coming up with nothing. 
 Any ideas here?

I was thinking instead to turn them into Air Monitors but I am a bit unsure as to what value I will actually see from these? I have configured an AP group as Air Monitors and put some access points in it but I can't really see how I monitor or quantify the value they add or log what they are actually doing for our environment? We are running Mobility Conductors with 8.6 and we also have Airwave. Is there somewhere I can monitor the Air Monitors and see what they are achieving? Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I wanted to send notifications from Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows.
 I created a new azure user ie.: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com).
 I added this user to the group which exclude the user from any Conditional Access settings.
 I created NewSMTPBasic authentication policy (AllowBasicAuthSmtp true) and assigned it to the user
 I setup SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled : False 
 My settings of Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows are 
 smtp server: smtp.office365.com
 email: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 port: 587
 SSL/TLS: Yes
 user to authenticate: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 Password: password of [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com) 
 My problem is that it works only with above settings. If I want to change email address to any email like: [djwheele@domain.com](mailto:djwheele@domain.com), [anymail@domain.com](mailto:anymail@domain.com), any existing users in our domain it doesn't work. 
 Did You ever had similar issue? Can You help me to solve it? Why I can send emails only to the user who is used to authenticate on smtp.office365.com ???? 
 Thank You in advance.

 Im trying to connect a copper SFP 10G (from Mikrotik) to a stacked C9300 to a DELL switch (that also supports 10Gb) but there is no link between them. I've tried different ethernet cables but no success. I tried the same ethernet cable to connect between two regular 1G copper port and it works so nothing wrong on the cable (it is a CAT6 cable). 
 I also tried to connect the copper SFP between the stacked switches (I connected one copper SFP in one port on the master switch and one copper SFP in the slave switch and connected an ethernet cable between them) and still no success, but Im not sure if you could do these tests between stacked switches.
 Either way, I also checked if that the interfaces are not in shutdown mode or err-disabled mode.
 I configured the "service unsupported-transceiver" to see if that will change anything but no success. 
 The setup I have is a stacked 9300 (two switches) and plugged in two copper SFPs, one in the master switch and one in the slave switch that goes to a dell switch so I can form a LACP between the stacked C9300 and the dell switch.
 Appreciate any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm currently reworking our corporation's wifi and I've got EAP-TLS working, however I want to permit only a specific group of users from our local AD.
 I've got the CA up and running and publishing certificates all around to the computers (old setup) and I've got the ruleset for EAP-TLS working with GPO on the Windows domain computers.
 My problem now is that I need to permit access only to a specific group in AD as the ruleset just points to users/domain computers so everyone with a domain computer gets access.
 Once a user who's not in the group logs on I want the authentication to fail.
 I've tried adding /users/domain computers AND /group/ as a requirement in the auth policy, but the group I added in ISE External Identity Source/groups doesn't show up in the policy. I also removed a few groups and it doesn't seem to update in the policy set or the condition library.
 Is this a known bug in ISE 3.1?
 I need the computers to log in to the wireless prior to actually logging into the computer so it can reach the DC for login, then drop out of the user is not in the specific Security Group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is the wrong place to be asking this question, but it is my first time seeing this issue before thought I would try my luck here.
 We have an on-prem environment using a local domain - just a standard dc server with AD and a RDS server - User1 is already logged on to the RDS server. Then User2 comes in to start their day logs into a Windows 10 PC which is domain joined and receives "Welcome User1" in the windows login greeting and User1 is then disconnected from their RDS session and User2 has actually loaded User1's profile - desktop icons and all.
 Any ideas what may be causing this, I have tried the following:
 -Removed User1 and User2's profiles from the Windows 10 PC and then re-added only User2 back on to the device but the issue is still occurring - User 1 no longer uses the Windows 10 PC just works on the RDS.
 -Removed the Windows 10 PC from the domain and re-joined to the domain. The RDS server itself is new only a month or two old has been happening ever since the RDS server was setup I was informed.
 any further suggestions on what else we can try here? - getting close to the too much time wasted - blow away windows and reinstall and see if it happens again.

 I need to migrate a IPSEC Tunnel from a Sophos UTM to a Fortigate 200F.
 Remote Gateway is a Checkpoint Firewall. So far so good. 
 Now I face 33(!) SA's which are established on the Sophos. Let me point you a picture:
 Sophos : Site A
 Checkpoint: Site B
 ​
 Site A got following Networks:
 192.168.105.0/24
 192.168.100.0/22
 and a Host 192.168.40.100/32 
 ​
 Site B:
 10.3.0.0/24
 10.2.0.0/24
 10.1.0.0/24
 10.1.7.0/24
 10.1.4.0/24
 10.1.6.0/24
 10.1.2.0/24
 10.1.1.0/24
 10.1.8.0/24
 10.1.5.0/24
 10.1.3.0/24
 ​
 I'd love to do SNAT on Site B, but I've never done that on Checkpoint. I know on FortiGate we can use 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 and let the Policies do the Denying. Is there a way to do that on Checkpoint or how would you go about this problem ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a company with a good MDM solution, they don't want people using their personal, unregistered devices to access work email. Normally this works out fine and they get a "blocked" message when the mobile browser is detected.
 But recently a loophole was discovered - on Android phones at least, users have the ability to trick the system by enabling desktop mode and then logging in through 2 factor.
 This is possible because getting into email by 2 factor through personal computers is allowed. But we don't want people on their phones doing it, otherwise what's the point of using an MDM? This loophole was discovered only on Android but it's possible it exists on iPhones too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Japanese shitbox PR-600MI.
 I am trying to have traffic come into the LAN ports on the router and then get routed to my sperate internal network.
 The static routing doesn't seem to be working. All of the LAN cables have to be plugged into the PR-600MI and there is no way around that aspect.
 I'm trying to fix the internal routing as the solution.
 PR-600mi network: 192.168.1.1/24 Linksys velop network: 10.10.10.1/24
 I had the Linksys velop on the 192 network but the pr600 was blackholing all dhcp requests and wouldn't work.
 Tried changing it to a different subnet but now the pr600 won't route to the 10.10 no matter what I do, including static routes.
 Does anyone have any experience with velop ? Maybe it is a Linksys side issue?

 A friend asked why when they google their website, when someone clicks the link for website on the right hand side (not the google returned link on the left) it redirects to a rotating spam URL for prescription viagra pills. If you browse to the URL manually and then click the website link on the right, it will redirect properly from that point on.
 If you click the returned website on the left it correctly goes to the site. Ping the address and it returns the correct IP as recorded in the ICANN lookup.
 Any suggestions? Site is hosted through GoDaddy and I have no admin controls, just a friend asking for help.

 I am trying to do redirection using iptables. The number one problem is that local connections do not go through the PREROUTING chain in nat. I also suspect that they bypass the nat table altogether because none of the connections are reaching my rules in nat. 
 Is it possible to redirect traffic from the filter table instead of the nat table? 
 Before I started, I was worried about redirect loops but now I'll be happy if I get a redirect loop.

 I was recently hired to a small company as the sole IT guy. I've had about two years of non-traditional Helpdesk experience at a different company handling their proprietary machines and software.
 The company I'm at now has about ~60 devices exclusively on MAC OS and no MDM, administrative directory or cybersecurity solutions in place. They want me to come up with a solution for phishing and other threats. I did some research on MDMs like Jamf Pro in conjunction with Apple Business Manager. I've also looked a bit at Barracuda for phishing. I've figured an MDM would be a good starting point but apparently need a strong knowledge-base to implement (lest I break something) along with some scripting.
 I'm honestly not really sure what direction to go in. Any resources for learning how to implement an MDM for Mac OS if this is the best route? Other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I work for an MSSP and we have a customer sending Meraki logs to our SIEM - they have enabled FLOWS, which results in a "flow" type as well as a "ip_flow_start" and "ip_flow_end". The flow log contains more data than the start and end logs - it has the mac of the source, the outcome (allow or block)
 As far as I can tell, the only value of the start and end logs are calculating the elapsed time of a flow. However, there is no unique field that ties the two together, only the source and destination IP and port. 
 I don't think the SIEM has any rules that rely on the calculation of flow length - so I figured I should just turn these off to save the customer some $ on data ingestion costs.
 Has anyone ever disabled just the flow start/end logs? In the interface there is only the Flows role. Googling this tells me the customer may need to engage Cisco support in order to do this?

I posted about this a couple months ago when I was trying to get the hardware, but now that I've had everything in my hands and have been trying to work with it, I'm stuck. I've literally been trying for 2 months. We currently have 2 TRENDnet TFC-110 MSTs that link our two buildings together using fiber. With the help of some others on Reddit, I purchased these two items (https://www.fs.com/products/11774.html and https://www.fs.com/products/43465.html). I got 3 of each to have backups in case one went bad. My Unifi switches recognize both SFP modules, but I cannot get the two switches to talk to each other with the fiber line that works just fine with the TRENDnet modules. Does anyone have ideas? I've tried everything I know (switching the fiber connections, restarting switches, changing cables/modules) and I'm stumped. Thanks!

 Now, this hasn't always been going on, and I'm not entirely sure what changed to make it begin popping up, but it's causing a lot of issues with our AnyConnect Management Tunnel connections, as the mgmt tunnel will not even attempt to connect if the credentials prompt is up. Once you "x" out of the prompt, the mgmt tunnel connects immediately.
 Has anyone else run into this?

 We have some later generation Extreme BOSS switches with multi-link trunking or MLT downstream to some VMWare ESXi servers. We have four links from the switch to one of our servers for instance.
 Are we supposed to ONLY configure trunks (no other LAG/LACP/MLT) downstream to these hypervisors? I noticed we have an exponential amount of broadcasts coming in from these MLT downstream switchports.
 IE on Cisco: conf t int fa0/1 switchport trunk encap dot1q switchport mode trunk
 We don't have a distributed vSwitch connecting to these switches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a self-serving post where I am patting my own back, but I don't care. I'm happy.
 We rate people on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Once a manager rates their employees, they need to justify the rating to senior management, who almost always challenge the rating, especially when it's a 4 or a 5. So, my manager is meeting with senior management and tells them he's giving me a 5, and they just say "We're good with that. Who's next."
 After that, he tells me what an outstanding job I do. How my troubleshooting skills are god-tier, at times. How somehow I seem to be available 24x7, and on and on.
 Honestly, I don't think I am all that exceptional. I MIGHT spend 15-20 minutes after hours responding to emails from people. And I usually stay VPNed in till the VPN times out at 8:00 PM and kicks me off. If someone needs something done and it takes 5 minutes, I just go do it, because I am already VPNed in and I don't want to deal with it in the morning.
 So, in a month, I don't work that much overtime. But when I am sitting in bed and watching something on my iPad and I see an email pop up where someone is asking for something simple, I'll just reply and tell them I can deal with it in the morning.
 So, this really is the ILLUSION of putting in an insane amount of after hours work. When it's really just me responding to an email now and then. As an old boss told me: carry your Blackberry on you at all times (this was the 2000s). 99% of the time, you'll never be bothered. But that one time someone calls you and you answer, you're everyone's hero. And they'll remember you're the guy who answered the phone when there was a problem.
 It's good to be recognized sometimes.

They have been looking for someone for about a year now, they hired someone recently but it didn’t work out at all, the guy did not know what he was doing so the position is back open. Put IT dept is finally getting rid off a lot of old and slow programs and I believe with me being young and eager to solve problems and make everyone life easier I should be a good fit. I’m just wondering what type of skills or metrics to look at I should bring to my boss to convince him on giving me the job. I already got Azure cert and I work Cisco devices all day so I know those.
 I want to bring these tools that I believe can help me do the job.

Used what I had which were cheap Netgear switches and now I've had to reboot a switch again due to a port or two locking up after 9 months of service. It is now unreliable and I need a replacement suggestion. Would like to go for 10G copper even though we have nothing with 10G just to be prepared. $2k budget each, 16 port or more. Nothing fancy. Don't need managed/L3/redundant PSU/etc. Max switching traffic at full load would be 2Gbps/ea but backups never run during business hours so it's unrealistic.
 I dug around for a bit. Is the Aruba 1960 any good for light iSCSI?

 I've been googling around searching for what would be the most practical solution to monitor our 6 /24 segments but I haven't found a definite answer. (We're a new and kinda small ISP).
 I've already set up a remote server that is monitoring these segments with Smokeping, but now we need a way to monitor them locally.
 I haven't found any info indicating that you can configure Smokeping to use a different interface or to ping with all interfaces, so, the faster solution would be to set up one Smokeping instance per each of our segments?
 Does anyone know a tool or service that could do this?
 Sorry if my English is a bit clunky, it is not my first language.
 Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: I just need basic ping and packet loss monitoring, like ping to Google, AWS, Netflix, Facebook, etc.
 nothing more at the moment.

 According to the article, someone 'high up' clicked on a bad link and it led to everything from their backups to payroll, scheduling, inventory, ordering and many other systems all being compromised. They also lost patient pharmaceutical info to the attackers.
 For this to be true it means a number of the most basic industry standard security practices were not followed, like:
  
MFA/Conditional access on remote access to email, VPN, RDP, etc...
 No separation of regular user accounts from admin, server and domain admin accounts
 Backups not immutable or air gapped
 Likely no 'next gen' firewall UTM monitoring internal servers
  
It also just seems crazy to me that so many systems could be accessible from a single user credential. This is a company that had $30 billion+ in sales last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been having a problem with Azure Virtual WAN routing and was hoping somebody might have some insight. I also posted to /r/Azure but did not get any replies.
 For testing, I have created a network described by the network diagram at https://imgur.com/a/Yf0INds . In my scenario, I am creating a traffic flow from VNet_1 to 10.200.0.10. BGP is used between the VPN Branches and the VirtualHubs.
  
At first, the traffic flow uses path 1. This is expected.
 If path 1 becomes unavailable then the traffic flow uses path 2. This is expected.
 If path 1 recovers then the traffic flow continues to use path 2. This is not expected.
  
My expectations are mostly based on the routing scenarios from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference . My understanding is that path 1 should always be preferred if it is available because the Virtual Hub will prefer a directly connected route over a route from a remote hub. I would at least expect the routing decision to be deterministic.

 I am wondering if there is best practice when it comes to firewall deployment or is it whatever makes sense to you.
 For much smaller deployments, such as an office with 100 users or less, to me, it makes sense to just terminate on the firewall but then again im not concerned so much about the inter-vlan traffic and the firewall policies are a bit more lax compared to a datacenter rollout.

 https://i.imgur.com/Id3NwcL.png
 I recently added a second nexus to our core. For WAN connectivity, we have one MPLS link from the carrier plugged into the original Nexus. This nexus is learning the BGP routes from our remote sites just fine.
 The second Nexus, however, is not. Instead, it is learning the routes from the firewall via OSPF, as each site has a VPN tunnel to the firewall as a backup WAN connection.
 Is it possible for nexus2 to receieve the BGP routes from nexus1 in the short term? Ideally, we would get a second drop from the carrier to have an uplink in nexus2, and they could also establish it as a bgp peer.
 Otherwise, what are my options?
 I could add static routes for each remote subnet on nexus2, but that doesn't seem ideal, either.
 Right now, the bgp config on nexus1 is as follows:
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/24 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 address-family ipv4 unicast soft-reconfiguration inbound always 
 And Nexus2, I configured bgp in case I ever needed to physically move the MPLS cable over.
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/16 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 update-source Vlan999 address-family ipv4 unicast prefix-list no-default-route in router ospf 1 redistribute bgp 999 route-map MPLS passive-interface default redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS route-map MPLS permit 10 match route-type external internal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am an intern, this is my first IT job. My ticket was migrating our email gateway away from going through Sophos Security to now use native Defender for Office because we upgraded our MS365 License. Ok cool. I change the MX Records in our multiple DNS Providers, Change TXT Records at our SPF tool, great. Now Email shouldn't go through Sophos anymore. Send a test mail from my private Gmail to all our domains, all arrive, check message trace, good, no sign of going through Sophos. 
 Now im deleting our domains in Sophos, delete the Message Flow Rule, delete the Sophos Apps in AAD. Everything seems to work. Four hours later, I'm testing around with OME encryption rules and send an email from the domain to my private Gmail. Nothing arrives. Fuck. 
 I tested external -> internal and internal -> internal, but didn't test internal-> external. Message trace reveals it still goes through the Sophos Connector, which I forgot to delete, that is pointing now into nothing. 
 Deleted the connector, it's working now. Used Message trace to find all mails in our Org that didn't go through and individually PMed them telling them to send it again. It was a virtual walk of shame. Hope I'm not getting fired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now we have identified many different scripting/coding methods being used to automate processes like reporting, database updates, account modifications, SharePoint updates, and much more. Things like PowerShell (.ps1), Batch files (.bat/.cmd), Shell scripts (.sh), Perl scripts (.pl), Autohotkey scripts (.ahk), Python (.py), complex Excel/Access creations, SharePoint forms/automations, and custom executables from god knows where (.exe).
 Everyone who came before was handed multiple jobs to complete, as their peers left the company. And they managed to do it. They automated it to make it possible. But then they were poorly compensated. No raises, or even pay cuts. CEO makes 2 mil, yet they get dropped from 100k to 70k to make it happen. So they left. Now the company is relying on this automation, but it keeps breaking. Nobody has expertise to deal with so many different cobbled together pieces. They basically eliminated 20+ jobs through automation, then let the people behind all this stuff walk. We're not even sure which servers it's all running on (dozens of them at least).
 Any recommendations for dealing with this stuff (other than leaving)?
 Any tools that can log all of this, and try to map out what everything is doing, and on what servers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently just messing around with some network traffic of an infusion pump and it's connection with the online configurator. The two are exchanging their communication via TCP. 
 I also did a vulnerability scan using GVM/OpenVAS and found out that the infusion pump is using an old/deprecated version of TLS (version 1.0).
 Now the data that is being exchanged is send in plain text (also a lot of sensitive data) despite TLS.
 I'm kinda new to networking and the whole security aspect that does with it so excuse my ignorance. However, shouldn't the data be encrypted in some sort because of the TLS that is implemented? The way i understand TLS is that the data is being encrypted right before it is being send over the TCP-Stream and then again decrypted at the destination.
 ​
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

All of a sudden last week something changed and our users are having difficulties logging in. They are getting all kinds of TLS and connection refused errors. It works intermittently but when they are able to log in, page elements don't load, it says quotes are submitted when they actually aren't.
 It's extremely old obviously, it can only run in edge on compatibility mode now, it was originally designed for Internet explorer. The kicker is that there's been no maintenance paid on this and it cannot be updated without that maintenance, and the person who created it left the company 10 years before I joined. I asked around and there's nobody that supports this app nor has there been anybody since the man who created it left supporting it.
 Now I have procurement beating down my door in a panic because nobody can do what they need to do. I told them I have no knowledge of this and that the solution is to cough up the maintenance to get this working but I was told that isn't an option. My job duties do not include application support. I am a systems administrator. 
 I'm all for helping out where I can but what do I do?

 We just can't set "Domain" parameter in opendkim.conf because we are sending emails with hunderds if not thousands of domains.
 rspamd is not an option because it's too heavy weight (slows down the mail delivery singificantly at this scale of emails).

 Long story short, the senior said she's probably got something VMWare lined up with a 3-6 month contract, and will called back tomorrow with a series of technical questions. I am a systems/network administrator with proficient L1-L2 experience, and even build servers both physical and virtual from the ground up, utilizing technologies such as Hyper-V and VMware on the occasional blue moon, or when the need arises. I have been doing this for roughly 10 years. 
 Now I understand while the market is pretty good for IT jobs at the moment, I can't seem to get over the fact, that all these high level engineering questions get thrown at you, or something that is super specific to the business. Half the time it's not even listed on the job advert and here I am thinking yep, a suitable sysadmin role only to be thrown curveball after curveball of things non related to original advert, or what's listed on my resumé.
 Does anyone else experience these sorts of things in the application process and what sort of questions should I expect tomorrow? She knows I'm not VMWare certified but still stated that an 80% success on the questions will land me the job!!! 80%!!!

 My environment consists of ten terminals and two file servers in different sites.
 The file server consists of drives:
 D-data
 P - fslogix profiles disks
 L - logs for storage replica
 All on OS server 2019
 ​
 During business hours I ran the test-srtopology command and then the entire network was disabled.
 I guess it happened during the ICMP traffic test or during perfomance tests.
 I honestly couldn't find and understand why it affected the entry to the terminals.
 Because I performed the replication in general on a different drive from the profiles, I ran the test and the command on drive D.
 The logic says that there is no effect on the function but the facts show that the problem started close to the time I was working on the file server with the command I explained earlier.
 And the problem was solved when it was over.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help in understanding this, what was the problem?
 And is the storage replica solution suitable for file servers with a function like mine.
 Drive D contains regular files and documents.
 ​
 Thank you!

 I am looking for a way to streamline some aspects of my job by doing some remote commissioning of PLCs, BACnet gateways, Modbus devices etc.
 While I am completing these works at the moment, the site is typically under construction, so there is no internet access or core switch operational. I have to manually plug into network switches around the the site and configure devices that way.
 I have got my hands on a cellular 3G router and have got it configured so I can use it to remotely connect to a site PC via RDP and use that for remote commissioning.
 What I would like to achieve is being able to plug this 3G router in to any isolated network switch on site and be able to connect to and pull data from devices such as the PLCs and gateways dynamically and communicate with a remote PC rather than a local RDP.
 Ideal setup would be:
  
Remote PC at home (192.168.xxx.xxx)
 3G router plugged into switch on site (10.10.xxx.xxx)
 Applications on Remote PC at home able to communicate with IP devices plugged in to network switch on site (For example opening my PLC configuration program and plugging in the 10.10.xxx.xxx IP Address to be able to configure it remotely.
  
I have got the dynamic DNS side of things working and am aware I can set up specific connections via port forwarding, but I am looking for a more dynamic solution where someone on site can plug this router into any switch on site and I will be able to talk to any of the 10.10.xxx.xxx devices dynamically without having to set up dedicated port forwarding for each unique IP address.
 Is a solution like this feasible, or should I continue with the site laptop/3G router combo I am currently using for remote access via RDP?
 Appreciate your time and input.

 The short text on this post is that I've been exploring backup options, we're currently an Acronis house for on-prem backups, and I've lost the will to live looking at a 300% jump in costs if we want to implement backups for the ~8TB data we have in 365 through mailboxes, SharePoint and OneDrive. 
 We're a nonprofit, and our 1.5 FTE staff in IT are supported by an MSP who want to resell us Veeam. We have Synology NAS for storing VM and database backups, distributed across 4 sites. I'm told the Synology 365 solution sucks but it's basically free. I want to save £5k a year by using it anyway. I'm looking for more impartial opinions than I've been given so far.
 Thanks in advance.

 Main problem i am faced with currently is tidying up the current AAD estate. 
 All applications are assigned directly to users in AAD rather than through groups, the problem i currently have is; 
 I want to assign applications through groups such as (Core Apps, Engineering, QA, Customer Ops) groups based on departments/roles within the business which will help in me automating application access. 
 My main concern currently is all the applications assigned directly to existing users, I wanted to avoid doubling up giving access but I'm struggling to think of a way to put everyone into groups, giving them the access they need and not creating duplicates. 
 Of course there's the manual route which I'm happy to do but will be kicking myself if there's an easier way to do it and i find out after. 
 Any advice or comments on me being an idiot are fully welcomed :')

What systems/processes would you put in place? 
 I.e. would you gift their laptops or pick them up? How would you pick them up if mainly remote employees? If gifted, what are the security risks? I know so many people who were left with blank, locked/unusable new laptops when they left their company. Seems such a waste, especially given the supply issues atm. 
 I’m new to all this, so I’d love to have some ideas in my back pocket just in case something like this were to happen at my company.

 It works, but is a nasty experience, especially on Android where the user has to choose encryption type (LEAP, PEAP etc) and certificate - with Google Pixel not working at all. On desktop and Apple devices it's tidier just taking the username and password.
 I'm being sold CloudPath as a solution but I just can't wrap my head around why I need an extra product.
 I've managed to get a landing page to authenticate to AD which works OK, except for all the certificate errors for the Ruckus landing page and then for XGS.
 Anyone got an idiots guide on how to improve this or am I going to have to fork out for a proper onboarding solution?

 Our Commvault 5 year deal is coming to an end.
 I'm not in that company so ling, so I inherited it with the job.
 It's going to end in about 5 months and I was considering my options.
 I've been working with veeam before, so I am familiar with it, but also considering 2 more vendors, veratis and rubrik.
 I was wondering if anyone can offer some technical tips in 2 scopes:
  
Things to check when look for a solution, like deduplication and encryption for example 
 
Comparison with the vendors I mentioned from your experience. 
 
 My current setting in comvault is with a dell scv2020 and a server connecting the storge (called media agent).
 For comvault renewal I've been notified the server won't be needed anymore but the storage is out of service.
 I can get 3rd party support for the storage, using it for a few more years and saving costs but I understand other vendors has their own appliances with internal storage and such, that will probably cost more to implement then using the storage I have now.
 I mostly backup DB, important data server and our vcenter.
 Also backing up to cloud, using metallic. 
 Any advises?

This project took me 2 weeks to complete (slacked off about half those days) but once finished it gave me biggest rush to see msfconsole load up, even if I did absolutely nothing with it. I knew I had to do this for a living. 
 fast forward, graduate college with a BS associates in computer programing because I hate school and couldn’t beat another 2 years. Finally get my degree at 20 and what do I do with it? Nothing. For 3 years. Since out of highschool I worked BS manual labor jobs. I always knew I wanted more, but didn’t think my degree would get me anything. Until 6 months ago. 
 Now, by pure luck, I’m a tier 1 sysadmin (skipped help desk completely) at a VoIP company, writing a script to fully automate the setup of a wireless modem in a fanless PC, to cut a two box implementation down to 1, and simplify the process for those who need to install the equipment. 
 Pinch me I’m dreaming. 
 There’s nothing like the feeling of rebooting a device, watching your logs show you over and over again a successful setup, and knowing the months it took to make this happen resulted in a (somewhat) stable configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know what some might say right away, imposter syndrome, etc, and there might be some of that.
 But in other real ways I’m not good enough at my job and it’s hurting me, hurting the clients, and hurting the customers.
 There’s really two problems: one is that I’m tech-savvy and have a real knack for this stuff, but past a certain level of technical difficulty and outside of a certain level of emergency I lose focus and falter in knowledge. Like, if the server is down right now, I can figure outa way to get it back up. I might not be able to articulate how, but I’ll get it running again. But ask me to troubleshoot what happened after the fact and I’ll flounder. Similarly if you give me a bunch of machines and an end result, I can get them running… but are they configured correctly, or do they just “kinda work”?
 The second is I really have a hard time working hard enough or doing the work I need to be doing. If I don’t have a person calling now, I try to go to my ticket queue, and I can sit and stare at tickets or click in and out of them multiple times without doing anything. And that’s if I don’t give in to the temptation do something else entirely. I’ve blocked Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook on work computers during the day, and it helps, but I can still find ways to not do work. I have things that sit in a queue for days or weeks because I get so anxious I avoid them until I can’t any longer.
 I’m failing the rest of my team, and I feel like shit all the time about it. And that just makes it worse.
 I think about jumping ship to another job, but I actually like the company and people I work for, and I know it would only help for six months to a year, and I’d be right back where I started.
 I don’t know, this may not be the place to talk about this, this is less a technical conversation than maybe mental health mixed with discipline, but maybe some of you have some advice to help me get back on track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two industrial machines that communicate via broadcast and multicast traffic. 
 I'm trying to block a set of ports and multicast addresses while keeping the other broadcast and multicast features working. 
 So far the devices I have laying around will only apply the firewall on routed traffic, not touching the devices on the same network.
 Looking for a recommendation on a device. Hoping to avoid a micro PC with two network ports: our setup is portable, people tend to yank power before worrying about shutdown sequences.
 Details:
 Broadcast is used for detection then multicast for actual communication, so both machines need to be on the same LAN to play nicely.
 They also use two realtime communication protocols at the same time, one protocol is nice and efficient, and the other one tries to hog the entire link to itself. The nice protocol uses IGMPv2 and the 236.0.0.0 range, the other protocol is a blackbox but uses 239.0.0.0 and opens ports 30000 thru 30007. I think if I could drop 239.0.0.0 and the associated ports I could solve my issues.
 I'm trying to add Point 2 Point wireless for long range comms using the lightweight protocol, but the heavyweight protocol seems to saturate the wireless bridge and the lightweight protocol can't connect. Everything works OK enough with Wifi 6 links, but I'm trying for hundreds of feet in a noisy environment, with TP Link P2P or Ubiquiti P2P limited to their 100Mbps ports. Upgrading to the 5ghz P2P stuff seems like kicking the can down the road, since at 15 feet away the heavyweight protocol is laggy over 802.11ax.
 Googling around brings me to articles about "Packet Filtering Firewalls", but without naming any devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was using explorer patcher to move my taskbar to top successfully before 22H2. But yesterday my computer got updated and the taskbar went back down. So, I tried a bunch of stuff until I managed to get it back on top and, as I found this instruction nowhere, I share here in case someone needs it.
 The difference between this solution and the regular instruction I found around the internet is that they all suggest editing values of a "MMStuckRects3" key, which was working for me before 22H2, but not anymore. The hack is to add a new REG_BINARY to the registry key below (create if does not exist):
 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MMStuckRectsLegacy]
 The name of this new value must be the device instance path (second property when navigating to Devices Manager > Monitors > (target monitor name) > Properties > Device Instance Path). Get everything after "DISPLAY\" and replace the other "\" by "#", such as:
  
Device Instance Path: DISPLAY\PHLC056\5&3C07B47&0&UID266
 Registry key name: PHLC056#5&3c07b47&0&UID266 (letters in lower case between # and &UID)
  
Using this as the name of the value, enter the following binary value:
 30 00 00 00 fe ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 3e 00 00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 60 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
 Restart explorer.exe or sign out/in and the second monitor taskbar should be at the top.
 Hope it helps!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of background:
 I'm responsible for deploying Android-based devices in MDU/manufacturing/healthcare environments. Anywhere from 50 to over 1500 at a time. The process involves updating the device firmware and enrolling into an EMM/MDM of some sort. Because of the nature of the industry, a lot of the time we're forced to use guest Wi-Fi networks or a mobile hotspot to do so, which means we're limited to running 4-8 at a time, and even then, still run into issues that require a reset and re-enroll of the device.
 That said: here are the back-end requirements needed to complete these steps:
  
For the firmware updates, an HTTP/S server (apache, IIS, nginx, etc.) w/ relatively quick on-board storage (SATA SSD or PCIe NVMe).
 For Google services and EMM enrollment, a decent (unrestricted) pipe to the internet.
  
I'm thinking I can kill two birds with a single device, but I've yet to find something that supports the following:
  
Wifi 6 router supporting HTTP/S server functionality and
 Cellular WAN functionality (5G or LTE cat. 16 or better) OR
 the ability to authenticate via RADIUS to hotel landing pages that require a last name and room number, for example.
  
My initial thoughts are to go with an x86 appliance such as the FW6D from Protectli, though I wanted to get your thoughts before I made a decision. 
 Thanks in advance!!

I’d add and drop fiber links from the ring, add the configurations for the new interfaces in IOS-XR, write the MOP, sometimes order equipment and deploy it to a hub, and either ran the maintenance or scheduled it to a overnight guy to do for me. 
 I also did new turn-ups of E-BGP peers on the CRS-16, and helped manage the core route reflectors. We were first escalation for outages as well. 
 I left work for FMLA reasons and my confidence is low. Most jobs are enterprise and not sure what to expect really. It’s hard for me to remember some topics I knew inside and out. Managed primary the underlay transport but did some MPLS L2VPN, L3VPN, and VRF stuff for enterprise BGP peering.
 Anyone have any tricks or tips to quickly catch myself back up? I find re-reading material I’ve already read to be difficult. It’s like the information is in the back of my head and the moment I read it again it becomes boring.
 Also having trouble finding interviews. I used to get several lined up and competing offers. Barely even getting responses from company recruiters. Often passed up and never even spoken too.

 It's working decently, but I've ran into an issue. One of the plays is meant to configure an access and voice VLAN on an interface, but it appears to be executing the commands out of order. Specifically, I think it is trying to disable trunk encapsulation before setting the interface's mode to access (this particular interface was set to trunk prior to trying to run this test).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I almost posted this in r/homenetworking because the needs are so basic. 
 My friend has asked me to recommend a router for his small business office. They only need it for delivering internet to their staff laptops. They don't have an internal network/domain or anything. All of their HR and Scheduling they just use websites for and all storage is google cloud storage. 
 They have equipment from Cox but the router constantly drops connections and has a weak signal at the far end the building. And it seems to be limited to 10 connections simultaneously when there are generally about 15 to 18 people in the office at peak. 
 They're just looking for something that's fairly simple to setup/manage, can deliver solid speeds, and allow upwards of 20+ users simultaneously. 
 It almost seems like any basic router will do the job, but I think signal strength was my concern as the office isn't HUGE, but their internet comes in in one corner of the building so the router will go there, and have to pass through many many walls to reach the offices at the opposite end. 
 Thanks for any recommendations

 I understand that the CLI is limited but my question is how much it is limited compared to IOS? 
 And other than that, what are the main differences between the 2 switches? Note that we are probably not going to use stacking and additional power supplies. Is the cbs220 weaker hardware and performance wise compared to the c1000?

 ​
 Currently we have a very basic network. The only redundancy we have is our firewall which I believe I am going to upgrade to Palo, but maybe Fortinet. The current switches we have are simply access switches. SG500X switches that are not stacked. I have been pressing to upgrade the configuration and it may happen.
 Do you think some type of Collapsed Core implementation is overkill for this network?
 I have been looking at possibly going Aruba for core and access or do i keep the SG500X's and just get a 9200
 I am trying not to freak them out with pricing but now is the time to future proof some of our equipment so i have a good argument.
 Thoughts? Recommendations? Thanks.
 Edit: Adding a few notes on how our network is used.
 Email - 365
 SharePoint for some doc storage
 Data warehouse located in Azure (Tunnel back to office)
 2 Hyper V hosts basic servers (AD/DNS/Storage/Dynamics GP/RRAS)
 Datto which will most likely be decommissioned and will use our Veeam server as backup target along with NAS that will stay at our old office for offsite.

 But within the next week, she will disappear from her team. 
 If it matters, this user was an active member of the organization back in 2019, left to have a baby, and just came back this past month. Her account was never removed. Her sign-in was rescinded and her mailbox was set to shared. When she got rehired, we just re-issued her a Business Standard License and set her mailbox back up. 
 But every Monday, when she opens her teams app, it shows her as "not a member" of any teams, and she's not permitted to join any unless I go through the admin portal and do it. 
 ​
 What could I be missing? Should I just delete everything and recreate the user entirely to be rid of this headache?

I manage all our systems and network infrastructure, so I have a lot of things on my plate. Also another task I manage is helpdesk support, most of which is simple password resets and on/off-boarding of employees. 
 Here recently I've been getting overly frustrated with some of the dept heads, they are down my neck with anything and everything when something isn't going properly with their employees (Always the same employee) computer, etc. It's mostly their sarcastic tone and wording that makes it seem like I'm just licking my toes in my office. When In the last few weeks I've been getting things ready to switch out our core switches and 4 of our sites Cisco ASAs and moving to FortiGate. A lot of behind the scenes things they have 0 idea about and I don't even waste my breath explaining.
 Starting to really regret this job and looking into moving to something more enterprise level and dealing with end-user support

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had my renewal meeting today and I knew this was coming and was prepared for it. What I was not prepared for is that Veeam is actually charging a fee to migrate you from the Socket Model to the VUL Model. This fee is as much as my renewal. In what world does this make sense? We want to move folks to our new VUL (which will increase me $2K per year on its own) but we are going to make their renewal cost double to do it? So, you want me to pay a fee to pay you more? You would think they would SAVE you money year 1 to get you into the new model. I'm no rocket scientist, but what idiot approved this or thought this would fly with customers?
 I know Veeam is the best, blah blah blah, but this was a kick straight to the face and honestly is disgusting that they think this is acceptable. I haven't considered a competitor in 10 years, but this "fee" is hard to ignore. I'd go with not Veeam out of principle at this point.

 What solutions do you have?

 Can't glue it :) Would look a bit strange. When i did some research on the net i wondered that i could not find a lot regarding this topic. I would assume this is something a lot of us have to struggle with?

 He also mentioned we have an "internal LAN block which doesnt get advertised but you could utilize them and they get routed through your WAN IP" Is there a name for something like this I could do more research on? I am at a loss for what that means.

 I am basically just doing different checks and the at the end I get a bunch of lines saying complaint or Not compliant.
 Is there a way I can summarize all these print statements? Like at the end say "10 compliants and 2 not complaints". That way I don't have to read down through everything, I can just get one line saying how many of each?
 Also want to point out that this will be run on multiple switches. So it would be nice to maybe at the end print "switch 192.168.1.1 has 2 complaints and 10 not complaints". Or something like that.

I can SSH to the outside interface (access is restricted to our Corporate IP block) and reboot them and they come back up and will function normally for days.
 We haven't encountered this issue on the 5508X's that we have, only the 5506X's. 
 This began occurring when we updated to 9.16.3.15 but we're now on 9.16.4 and the problem is still occurring.
 We are in the process of migrating to FPR-1010's but this issue is a PITA. 
 Looking at the syslogs it appears to happen each time the IPSEC tunnel is recreated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has used Teamviewer for over a decade. In that time they forced us to purchase not one, but two different so-called "Lifetime licenses"
 When purchasing the first license they failed to mention that when they upgraded their software they would push a new version to our clients before we could have a chance to stop it, and then almost immediately prevented us from connecting to our managed systems without first upgrading.
 After we purchased these "lifetime" licenses, they abruptly switched to a subscription model.
 The cost of that subscription has increased by about 100% in the last 4 years, and now they've implemented really low device limits!
 So not only has my cost doubled, I would have to purchase additional licensing just to keep managing the same number of computers I have managed all along.
 Save your money, go with another vendor!
 **Edit**
 After sending an email to the entire leadership at TV, expressing my amazement that they intended to try to extort a final year's subscription from us, the very rude person I initially spoke to, that kept incorrectly asserting that we always had device limits on our account, called back to once again try to offer me discounts to keep me with their company.
 I thanked her for giving me content for my most popular reddit post ever, and read off the contracts from 2015 and later to her on the phone. Now they're going to go ahead and cancel us without trying to forcibly renew. Pfft

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a simple question with a probably not so simple answer.
 We have an Out of Office calendar that I wanted to automate a bit more of so that after people submitted their OOO reason they didn't have to manually categorize the event with a specific color.
 To do this, I created mail flow rules on the Room Resource inbox that applied categories based on subject line text. This is working, but comes with a side effect that the attendees are showing on the meeting subject - example below:
  
MySecretWork Account - WFH; Out of Office; MySecretWork Account
  
I already went into the room resource and adjusted the following settings:
  
Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity outofoffice@domain.com -DeleteSubject $False -AddOrganizerToSubject $False
  
This was done so that the subject line wouldn't be replaced solely by the organizer's name. Attendees are now showing up on calendar though, which adds a bunch of clutter to calendar.
 I just want the meeting requests on the Out of Office calendar to look like the below:
  
MySecretWork Account - WFH
  
No extra info - just the actual subject line of the meeting request.
 Is this possible? I didn't see anything on the Set-CalendarProcessing documentation page, but if there is a setting elsewhere that can achieve this (either GUI or PowerShell) please let me know!

 I am looking for a physical firewall that will allow me to block websites (ie: YouTube, Twitter) in my office network. And I want to limit the access to this firewall so that I can access to it only by plugin a laptop to it (meaning: no remote access to the firewall configuration).
 What device I am looking for?
 Thanks a lot!

 I'm currently trying to roll out Windows Hello for Business for a small set of users ( three users in total ). I used this deployment guide from Microsoft to set it up:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-deployment-cert-trust
 So far, I've been able to get 1 of the three workstations / users to successful be able to use Windows Hello for Business. The other two keeps showing that PIN and Facial Recognition are "unavailable". What I can't seem to find is a way to troubleshoot why these other two aren't able to use the service. Does anyone know where I can start troubleshooting the issue and help to correct it? TIA

 Since then, our Server 2019 member servers in the domain can no longer contact the domain controllers for GPUpdate, kerberos authentication etc. nobody can login to the 2019 member servers or authenticate against them with their domain accounts and the network card/firewall no longer get the domain profile and instead get assigned the Private profile.
 We are deploying the v1.2.1 version of the CIS MS-L1 benchmark to all our 2019 servers succesfully since it was released without issue.
 Only since last night do we suddenly have an issue.
 Does anyone else have this issue or know what setting in the benchmark is now causing this issue?

 Their SAMAccountName would be something like domain\domjd
 Has anyone experienced something simular to this before?
 Is there perhaps some registry etc. that needs to be changed?

 to use this feature you need to have some specific license For the organization account first and another license specific license for the user account
 Exchange online Plan 2, Microsoft 365 E3, Office 365 E3 or anything higher will do for the org account
 And Depending on the license the organization has the employee account must have one the licenses below.
  
 Exchange online Plan 2 license
 Microsoft 365 E3 or Office 365 E3 license or higher
 Microsoft 365 Business Premium (Exchange only) license
 Office 365 E1 license with an Exchange Online Plan 2 or Exchange Online Archiving add-on license
 Microsoft 365 Frontline F5 Compliance or F5 Security & Compliance add-on license
  
And one of these license as well assigned to them. Office 365 E1 license with a SharePoint Online Plan 2 or OneDrive for Business Plan 2 add-on license 
 are these correct?
 and also after exporting a mailbox, can i unassign the license and re-assign to another user? instead of buying 10-20 licenses?

 Other users can be added and removed fine from the on-prem AD but this user is just stuck in the group which they need to be removed from. 
 I’ve tried syncing an on prem account with their cloud account and adding then removing, but they still are stuck in this group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So I've got a client who has started receiving the following message pretty frequently over the last month or so: 
 "Trying to connect to: \\domain.tld\SharedData\fileshare"
 It seems to occur mainly in Office apps ie Word, Excel, Project but then again these are the primary apps they use. I can generally replicate it by going File -> Open, open any file, then go File -> Save As and immediately I get the dialog box with the above message. Once it resolves (after up to a minute) and the document saves it doesn't occur again for a period of time. To me that smacks of DNS but I can resolve the share via Windows Explorer or by doing an nslookup at any time before or after opening and saving and it resolves with no issues.
 Environment is Windows Server 2019 on premises Active Directory running two DCs in Hyper-V VMs on two different physical hosts. I'm running DFS Namespace with both DCs listed under Namespace servers. Less than 50 clients. Clients are all Windows 10 with two Windows 11 machines connected via either wireless or gigabit ethernet. Addresses are assigned via DHCP and both DCs are the only DNS servers assigned. Office applications range from 2016 to 365.
 It must be DNS (even when it isn't lol) but I confess I'm not sure where to go from where or how else to troubleshoot. If you can access a share immediately via Windows Explorer, or have nslookup return an immediate correct result, what else is left? And yet the problem still occurs to the point that people are getting visibly frustrated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 In our Azure tenant we have recently imported 300 or so guest users and are now in the process of troubleshooting the 10 or so that have sign-in problems. Most of these problems are pretty clear and solvable, but there's one that I can't figure out.
 We invited this user with a [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address, and she tries to sign in with that address. When she does however, the AADSTS50020 error occurs, with a completely different [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) address:
 https://imgur.com/x2W1T6y 
 Now, AFAIK that error means that e-mail address isn't known in our tenant, which is correct, since [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) isn't invited in our tenant, [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) is.
 When I check the [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) user in our Azure AD, i can't find the hotmail address anywhere:
 https://imgur.com/lLMJpPh 
 https://imgur.com/W1U5Vyj 
 My suspicion is that somehow the [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address is linked to that person's MS account. 
 My question is, how do I solve this? I could invite [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) into our Azure AD, but the [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) is an old address of this person which she no longer wishes to use. So I need to solve this and have this person log in with their [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address.
 Any ideas? Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am studying Windows networking pretty hard at the moment and trying to understand the need for Microsoft's Browser service.
 I understand that it doesn't require dns, so what makes sense to me is that it is primarily needed for use in non-active directory network environments. Is that right?
 And/or is there some other reason for it being functional in active directory? I.e. does it actually provide something that active directory doesn't or can't?
 While I am here asking questions I will also ask, what in your estimation is the prevalence of non-Active Directory Windows networks these days? (I can see small offices/doctors/dentist surgery sized places not needing active directory)
 Thanks in advance!
 Fwiw I have googled and read several links but haven't found anything that really helps me understand why it exists at all now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning or afternoon, fellow guys and girls.
 I have a new issue on some of my notebooks I have never seen before. We deployed a new Update to our Check Point VPN Client on ~ 100 devices. On a minority of the devices, the updated caused to kill the device's connectivity completely. The WiFi Adapter still shows networks it can (and also can connect to them) but then reports "No Internet access".
 An "ipconfig" reveals what's going on: it shows nothing at all. It seems like Windows lost track of it's adapters.
 Unfortunately, uninstalling networking devices does not do anything. Manually installing the Ethernet and/or the WiFi driver doesn't resolve it either. The only solution we had until now was to completely reinstall Windows.
 Additionally, the Event Log does not show anything relevant to find the actual cause neither.
 ​
 Has anyone else had this issue and might know a solution that does not include calling the user to the office for a reinstallation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have any recommendation for a PCIE raid card. I have a client that is considering to use a workstation as a offsite backup/monitoring/metrics server. Since the server is in a remote location space is limited. We plan on utilizing it to run ESXI with one datastore to run a freenas server (to handle replications) and a few other VMs for monitoring and testing.
 Yes we thought about using freenas's vm and jails but we opted to run it in an esxi environment.
 And before anyone starts saying anything we already have onsite and a remote backup solution. This is just a hey if we lose a lot of data lets see if we can restore here before we send in an order to recall data. 
 Obviously if you have any links (and yes ebay included) that would be great. Ideally we are looking for new pcie raid cards that can connect sata disks. Refurb units will be fine but we are looking for at least some sort of warranty to replace the card within a year if something were to happen.
 ​
 I was also thinking of getting this from newegg
 https://www.newegg.com/p/14G-0006-001G5?quicklink=true
 And passing the card in to the freenas VM itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone of r/sysadmin, I’m a young up and comer in the IT world and not even a sysadmin, been doing this for 2 years now. My journey started off at a local technical school where I was taught the basics of IT and networking, from there I got my A+, Net+ and CCNA. 
 Fast forward to today, and I find myself in a nice helpdesk position with a lot of downtime that in 5 months I have been able to completely study and pass my ms-203, my Sec+ as well as the ms-100 and now looking at the ms-101 as well as the company is paying for a course for my az-104. 
 Well, as I have been doing these I have been looking around at jobs because well, helpdesk isn’t my goal, I love working with the MS cloud suite and would love to get into a position where working with that stuff is my main responsibility, but everywhere I look, I may have some of the requirements, a lot of place are asking for many more years of experience, but the one thing I’m seeing most is that darned piece of paper I don’t have. A degree. 
 So that brings me to my question for you guys, if you have a degree, when did you get yours? I’m only 23 myself and kind of figure there’s no reason I shouldn’t just do it, and I was looking and a lot of the courses for an Associates in Cloud Architecting are for certs I already have, so I would think it would be a cakewalk.

 Now I've done a lot of $$ number crunching etc on the relative costs and risks, but what they're asking for is actual case studies about why product lifecycles are important, and the increased risk of device failures based on age of the device.
 I can find the government (AU) tax department info about expected product lifecycles, but I'm having trouble finding any actual case study analysis of why those are the expected product lifecycles. 
 Anyone know of any such studies they can share?

At least that's the perception, I've met so many people that will straight up ignore you if they haven't created a ticket or booked in a meeting to solve an issue. 
 I feel like an alien for just being a happy-go-lucky chap willing to help out anyone and everyone. It's a good feeling to be someone who's reliable and a go to source for info or assistance. 
 I also see a lot of posts on /r/itcareerquestions regarding "What are IT jobs where I never ever have to talk to anyone?". The answer is none. You will need to talk to people and being able to talk to people will make your life and others so much easier. 
 Just wondering if anyone else feels the same way as I do.
 EDIT: I'm starting to think that I haven't become the 'grumpy introvert' is because I have been in the industry long enough for it to crush my soul yet...

 Original post:
 Hopefully, this is only happening on one file, but I'm not sure I would know.
 Document stored in SharePoint mysteriously disappeared. It is not in the recycle bin, but I did find an old version in our SaaS backup and restored that.
 Minutes after restoring the file to its original location, it disappeared again. We cannot figure out why.
 Additional information: I tried restoring the file to its original location, but it did not restore. I restored to a separate SharePoint site where it happily sits waiting as instructed. Then, I download a copy to its original location and it's gone in minutes.
 Any idea what might be causing this?

 Can i create a VPN (using OPNsense) to a "dead in the water" local network, using split-tunnel with the only route being to/from RMM ports, with no other traffic allowed? I basically just want to route RMM traffic so that it comes from a known IP.
 Is VPN secure used in this way? Is there any risk of clients reaching local network resources?

We have one of our circuits coming in over coaxial. connection comes into the standard router provided by the provider and bridged to our our FW. we are looking to bring TV into our Break room. I'd like the TV Receiver in there. would a moca set up work? are their better options ? not looking to have more cabling ran. I'd like to use the existing ethernet we have ran. 
 Let me know if there are any further details needed to help design this run.

 I guess it depends on who you get / technology area but I’ve a couple of engineers recently who have been quite frankly useless!
 Most recently Nexus support. An hour on a webex of ‘investigations’ half of which was spent in compete silence with the odd chase here and there from myself. Eventually only to be told N9K doesn’t support disruptive upgrades which doesn’t even make any sense. 
 It just doesn’t seem to be the same as it once was…
 Edit: wow glad it’s not just me then! I’ll be writing a few emails I think!

        <updated>2022-11-13T18:04:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, it seems like Cisco has amended the EoL announcements for the following products:
  
Catalyst 3650: 
 Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2024
 New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2026
 
 Catalyst 3850: 
 Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2023
 New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2025
 
 Catalyst 3850 fiber SKU's: 
 Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 4/2025
 New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 4/2027
 
  
They basically seem to extend the vulnerability and security support by 2 years. As the Catalyst 3650 & 3850's will never get IOS XE v17.x support, IOS XE v16.12.x will be the last version to run on these. The EoL announcement for IOS XE v16.12.x also states:
  
Please Note: Catalyst 3650 and Catalyst 3850 platforms are not part of this EOL announcement. Refer to 3650/3850 Hardware EOL announcement for software support timelines.
  
Are we correct to state that with this Cisco is committing themselves to keep IOS XE v16.12.x alive for these platforms and fix future security issues might they be discovered? Because it seems like a lot of overhead to keep supporting such an old codebase. However these dates are important for us during budget meetings to help decide which devices to replace so we'd like to be correct in the interpretation.

 I’m testing Windows 11 on a couple of devices now, to prepare for a gradual rollout of the new OS to 300+ domain-joined devices over the next year. I’m testing registry changes locally but will need them to be pushed out via GPO eventually.
 I want to update the central store from the ‘Windows 10 21H2 v2’ Template to the ‘Windows 11 21H2’Template but am worried there would be issues like some Windows 10 reg entries being removed as they’re not needed in Windows 11.
 Have any of you run into issues after upgrading the templates when it’s a mixed environment?
 TIA for your help, never done this before and the old sysadmin is gone so I have no one here to guide/train me apart from good old Google! I don’t want to make too many mistakes and have the higher-ups on my case just a month into the new role!

 Does anyone else feel like in the time it takes to learn Ansible, you might as well just learn Python? Python is so powerful and arguably easier to implement more complex tasks once you get the hang of it. In the time it takes you to learn all of the modules in Ansible, I feel like you could just learn Python.
 I also feel like the error handling and debugging capabilities of Ansible are horrible. I know Ansible is not a programming language, however, I’ve noticed a lot of organizations that attempt to treat it as if it is. 
 This post isn’t to crap on Ansible, I am genuinely curious why some of you prefer it. 
 I am well aware that Ansible is written in Python, no need to iterate that point when most of us here are aware of that.

 What makes sense to me is that it is primarily needed for use in non-active directory environments. Is that right? Why is it still available in active directory environments (i.e. is there some other networking reason for it being there, or does it actually provide something that active directory doesn't/can't)? 
 Thanks in advance!
 Fwiw I have googled and read several links but haven't found anything that really helps me understand why it exists at all now.

 Went down a random Wikipedia rabbit hole last night and came across the ECHO, DISCARD and DAYTIME protocols. Curiosity got the best of me and I enabled them on an old Raspberry Pi just to test them out. I think the DAYTIME protocol is handy, almost like a (slimmed down) NTP alternative, and the DISCARD protocol could be useful as a network-based /dev/null.
 What other protocols exist out there in the same vein? What use, if any, do they have in modern networks? What are some maybe fun or obscure protocols that can still be run on modern IP networks? I'd love more ideas to investigate here. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! 
 So I joined this company a while ago, and noticed we have Teamviewer installed on a bunch of customer servers for "easy remote access" 
 I know this is from pure lazyness as we have VPN access to all of the customers. 
 What do you guys think, is it considered "safe" enough to leave Teamviewer running when it's locked down to our account only, and all users are only "members" in the teamviewer company. 
 I had the pros / cons with multiple colleagues about this, and both sides got good arguments. 
 What are your thoughts of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have worked as a sysadmin and devops for the last 15 years, last 7 years were in one company at the DevOps engineer and Site Reliability Engineer roles, but I had to quit for health-related issues. In my work I touched each part of the stack from hardware to Linux and Windows administration, to networking, monitoring, alerting, databases, webservers, data analysis and report building using SQL, troubleshooting issues involving many moving parts, log management, writing custom instruments in python, AWS, CI/CD, docker, incident resolution involving many people, so in general I’m quite familiar with modern Sysadmin and DevOps practices.
 It might look like a tremendous overkill for what I’m looking for, but right now my ability to work is quite limited, so I’m looking for small jobs involving server support and troubleshooting and some log and data analysis, which won’t take much of my time, but I can be oncall and available to fix issues on the need-to basis, and I can provide 24//7 coverage for critical infrastructure, first setting up some infrastructure for projects which concerns alerting and availability practices.
 I also did some mentoring for my friends concerning networking, linux, basic programming and server administration, because I like doing it. I even once wrote a Linux tutorial.
 I’m sure there should be demand for this and people would be interested in paying some monthly fee for someone skilled for looking after their stuff, but I don’t really know how to find it, because I’m used to working full-time in large companies. I tried but had no luck with Upwork for this, and I would like to learn places where I can find such gigs or talk to people and network.
 Thank you for your time.
 P.S. I didn’t write on reddit for a long time, but I was active here once, and for those interested, this is my old account: https://old.reddit.com/user/mwargh/submitted/ My Linux tutorial is here if you wanna look at my style: https://archive.ph/xDb8o

 A little bit of background. I've about 7 years of experience, worked with L2/L3 protocols, L2/L3VPN, MPLS, EVPN-VXLAN etc. I can't say I'm an expert at all these networking areas, but I've decent understanding on these. I've also worked with Cisco and Juniper OS and quite familiar with variants within and products. 
 Last two years I've picked up python and really like coding and automating some stuff. I think I like it more than the networking part itself. What kind of jobs are there where my networking experience will be beneficial but I get to do some python coding? I don't think I can go full software development as it seems daunting task to start from zero and my networking experience would be wasted. Any advice would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi alll,
 Preface: Using the OpenVPN server built into PFsense and using the OpenVPN Connect Client as it works across multiple platforms.
 I’ve been trialing OpenVPN with a MS NPS and the Azure MFA plugin installed. All is working well, I can press connect, get an MFA push etc
 However, i have been testing idle timeouts and have a potential issue. When the client times out, the session disconnects but will reconnect immediately and try over and over again, spamming Azure MFA. 
 On two occasions now, Push Notifications have just stopped working. I can’t get it to work again. I’ve removed the Authenticator device from the security portal, but when I go to add it back it fails (have tried via sign-in in the app as well which works), but still no push notifications. I have also checked blocked users in the multifactor authentication blade, but the account is not listed there.
 The only way I’ve found to get push notifications to work again, is to delete and recreate the 365 user, which is of course not ideal. 
 Has anyone experienced the issue with Push notifications being blocked? I raised a case with support but they have been absolutely useless.
 EDIT: The error code I get is Error Code: 500121

 They don't out-right fail but start to exhibit performance issues or have errors that prevent full system backups from completing (e.g. Macrium image backup).
 We are able to successfully clone them using ddrescue with a few KB of bad sectors detected.
 Firmware updates, trimming, and chkdsk /r do not resolve the issue with the drives and these drives have had the latest firmware on them.

 I recently climbed up to “Senior Systems Administrator”, and apart from the slight impostor syndrome, I’ve come to wonder, where do you go from here? 
 Yeah I did support roles, I put together servers, configure ESXi and RAID, design and implement Networks and Domains, perform migrations, etc etc. But what’s next? What are some higher positions that I can aim to get into? Why are some things that I SHOULD learn in my free time to improve? 
 I feel like I’ve hit a road block, I do all those things and I code and develop websites on the side, but I’m not sure where the road takes me from here. Especially that I’m currently not very happy at my current position and was advised by a lot of you here to find another position, especially one that gives me better vacation days per year. 
 My ultimate goal is to be happy, and to be fully remote/WFH. I’d like to hear it from the wise ones what they think I should do to improve and reach my goals. What did you do to reach your goals? 
 On a side note, should I get a university degree? I dropped out 8 years ago and became a commercial aircraft pilot, but due to the pandemic and the Grindy nature of the industry, I reverted back into tech. The only credentials I have for my field is my experience, tech savviness and my Network+ cert. 
 Cheers!

 I'll be up front and honest that I'm not that great at all with Azure AD, I do more front-line and hardware support, but I've been given a project to get MFA implemented for a client company due to Microsoft switching off basic authentication globally. 
 The plan was originally to enable MFA for all of the users, with small batches being done on a daily basis but I've found out this evening that 80+ manufacturing users that work on the factory floor can't use mobile phones for health & safety rules, so that throws out using MS Authenticator App.
 I know from the initial reading of the various guides online, that there is the possibility of using conditional access but I'm not 100% sure how to get this setup, as all of the systems onsite use a single DHCP scope so setting it up for a specific IP address range wouldn't be a viable option.
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and if I find a solution myself I'll update my post. :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to relay all incoming traffic to another matching, this is my current test scenario:
 ​
  (Internet) | | Alicloud (I would like to have the EIP here) EIP: 8.208.20.138 8.208.20.138 | ^ VM (DHCP) | +-------------------+ +----VM Hetzner---+ |IPv4: 192.168.60.89| <--- wireguad ---> | IPv4: Public IP | |IPv6: 240b:4005::30| | IPv6: Public /64| +-------------------+ +-----------------+ 
 The Alicloud instance, via DHCP, acquires a private IP class B (192.168.60.89) that is mapped to the public elastic IP 8.208.20.138, but it has a valid routable IPv6 address the one I use to create a wireguard tunnel to the VM in Hetzner.
 If I remove the private IP from the Alicloud instance ip addr del 192.168.60.89 dev eth0 I can't ping any more the public EIP (8.208.20.138) as expected, but still ipv6 is up and running thus the wireguard tunnel, from the one I one to route all the ipv4 traffic. In this Alicloud instance, I have proxy_arp and ip_forward 
 I am stuck figuring out how to route the traffic from the EIP to the VM in hetzner.
 Any ideas?
 The reason for doing this is to use servers with cheaper bandwidth or better connectivity to some regions, I am aware of the BCP38, but first, need to solve the routing problem, especially when not having the public IP bonded to the instance.

 can any one help me please
 So in a normal case we type reddit.com the browser (after DNS ) will:
  
-> establish a tcp connection then tls handshake ,in the handshake the broweser will receive a certificate from the reddit with a trusted CA ,then he will send the request to the server with the server ip address and the his src ip address 
  
​
  
now in the case of proxy :I'm still in doubt which one is correct (a root certificate of the proxy is already installed )
  
1-> the browser will establish a tcp connection with the proxy and also a tls handshake with the proxy but the certificate that he will get is the certificate of the proxy, 
 then the browser will verify the certificate(but here the browser will get a certification != that contain a domain not requested ?)
 and he can send a request https to the proxy -> the proxy will look at the request and
 then he will establish the connection with the server
 ​
 2->the browser will establish a tcp connection with the proxy and also a tls handshake with the proxy but the certificate that he will get is the certificate of the website but with the proxy as ROOT CA (how can the proxy know the website ?)
 the browser will verify the certificate(he will think that is the real website?) and he can send the http request (which ip address AS destination ?) the proxy will get the request and establish a connection with the server 
 ​
 please feel free to ask for clarification or even give me a deep explanation of the topic also if you know any resource I'm more than happy to learn

 So the business I am working for is deciding to actually put money into their IT department. By all means, go get your socks that have now been blown off. 
 One of the first things we did was provide E3 licenses to all our users. Another SysAdmin took charge of making all our machines hybrid joined to azure so that's neat. Months later though, an overwhelming majority of our devices are still Windows Pro. 
 The fix we found is going through Settings -> System -> Shared Experiences, seeing that there are problems with the user's account, and clicking "fix now" which prompts them for MFA and then huzzah, sorted. 
 So far this has been an incredibly manual process and I was wondering if we could have a thread sharing experiences with getting computers to Enterprise?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on some security automation and standardizing documentation of our zones (and subnet descriptions). Basically tackling this from two angles:
 Hierarchal Tags Zones:
  
Trusted 
 Client
 Datacenter 
 Server
 File Server
 
 DMZ 
 Shared
 Jump Host
 
 
 Untrusted 
 Vendor 
 VPN
 Jump Host
 
 IoT
 DMZ 
 External
 Internal
 
 
  
non Hierarchal Zone Tags:
  
firewall instance (ie, tag for all zones behind firewall)
 Geo (may make this a parallel hierarchal tag)
 Behind firewall (from default gateway perspective)
 Not behind firewall (this actually wouldn't be tagged directly. Technically everything is behind a firewall from an edge perspective. It would be NOT "Behind Firewall" AND "firewall instance" per firewall")
  
I'm having a hard time coming up with a good name for the Tag "Behind Firewall". basically we have some of the untrusted zone behind firewalls...the "Untrusted" is the dmz's or whatever that are behind the firewall, segmented from the general corporate network (client, datacenter), but we also have some "Trusted" zones behind theses same firewalls. as we get further into segmenting, I imagine "Trust" and "Untrust" will get more muddled from a network/routing perspective. I want a tag that does not reference the trust or anything security related. I just want to tag it from a network routing perspective (ie, this subnet is behind a firewall). I can use other tags to define the firewall, geo, function, etc etc.
 Any thoughts? I'm considering "Segmented", "Firewalled", "Behind" (not seriously)...but none of these are as elegant and descriptive as the function based tags.
 Also interested in other ideas of how to organize complex zones.

 Do I need RDS CAL or User/Device CAL licencing to add user to that domain? From what I've read, it should be User/Device CAL, but I just wanted to be sure, I'm on the right track. 
 Aditionally, I've googled with no success, the process to install said licences, any pointer regarding that, will be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I know what QinQ is in theory, C-Tag, S-Tag. 4096 VLANs with a single outer tag, scalability etc etc. But I've bit seen it in production. I'm about to move into a wholesale only ISP where I'm guessing this is going to be quite a thing as they grow.
 This is where my heads currently at, and I'd like any corrections/input into why we would use this.
 Let's say we have a wholesale customer with 6000 subscribers. Each on their own VLAN. 1-4096 get an S-Tag of 1. 4096-6000 get an S-Tag of 2. As this wholesale customer grows, we provision more S-Tags per block of 4096 customers?
 What happens as the company becomes massive, national scale. 4096*4096 is still a scalability limit, especially when one customer may get a second S-Tag and only need it for an additional 100 customers, wasting a chunk of space.
 Maybe I'm thinking about this all wrong, hopefully one of you can out this straight for me :)

 I’m hoping for some advice regarding a job I am in the process of interviewing for. I’m currently a field service technician with only about 9 months of experience servicing copiers/printers. The job I have made it to the second round for is a System Administrator role at a business with a 4 person IT team. I only have the Google cert and some virtual home lab experience. Did help desk in college about 8 years ago (unrelated bachelor’s degree). I haven’t lied or even really embellished my experience/qualifications. 
 The pay seems on the low end for the role, only about a dollar more than I’m a making now. The hours are also weird. However, it seems like a great place to gain experience and learn. Any advice on if offered whether or not to take it? I can provide more context if needed. I guess I’ll burn that bridge when I get to it.

 Looking at a high performance (cpu/mem) server for our memory intensive database. Previously ran this on rock solid IBM POWER pSystem platforms but the vendor decided to drop support for big blue.
 On the Intel X86_X64 side, looking for something solid from a reputable vendor, I have hands-on experience with commodity Dell PE R7xx servers that we use in a VMware cluster, and while they perform well for running commodity VMs - I am on the fence and looking at what other options are out there.
 Dell has the R940 in a 4-socket configuration, and HPE has ProLiant DL560 that is configurable in a 4-socket build.
 In researching, it appears Cisco has a UCS line of hardware, anyone have hands-on experience with these? How is their reliability and support compared to HPE/Dell?

 What is the salary range I should be asking for? US firms (Chicago, NYC) seem to pay $150k+ and higher for more experienced engineers. I couldn't really find much info for London.
 While this is early career advice, I don't think it breaks rule 5, r/networking is probably the best place to ask for HFT career advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a file server, which uses fiber, and a bunch of computers that use Ethernet. I've noticed that the ethernet based computers will use up and down at the same time but never 100MBs up and 100MBs down at the same time. It's oftentimes 30MBs up and 70 down, or 60MBs up and 40MBs down just for example. It equals out to 1000mbps (100MBs roughly) but never both up and down.
 The cables are Cat6 so throughput should be WAY over 1000mbps up and down but that doesn't seem to be the case.

 I tried to execute "traceroute" to see where is the problem but on PC on VLAN 30 when I traceroute reaches the Router interface IP 10.10.10.101 = Gi0/1.40 (yes, a subinterface because is neccesary in order to PC on VLAN 40 to be able to communicate with any PC on the network).
 Below, the traceroute and the ping to the Router works with no problem but if I ping 192.168.0.8 (the dhcp IP on the top Router connecting with Internet) and works so I don't know what is the problem and I don't understand why it doesn't work.
 If you need anything else that could help you, let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I'm currently doing 2nd line support and my manager has suggested I gain exposure of the company IT Infrastructure. To get involved with jobs that the Infrastructure Engineer would normally be doing. 
 So the infrastructure is on-premise and it is stuff like Dell EMC, Cisco Switches and Firewalls, VMware V-Sphere and a few other things which I can't remember from the top of my head. 
 Just recently I was able to get involved with a Switches and Firewalls upgrade project. It was myself, the Infra guy and NOC guy. I was assisting (with guidance) in installing the new hardware, running new cabling and testing the services that were working once the upgrade was complete. The actual upgrade bit was carried out mainly by the NOC guy and the Infra guy making sure that Servers/VMs were powered down/up and it's all good after the upgrade.
 That being said, I am seeking advice on this community on what courses I can study myself to get a better understanding of the role and aid me when hands on.
 Thank you and sorry in advance.

 What I can't seem to find specific details on are the reqs for the client cert itself, beyond having to be issued by the CA of the cert that is loaded into the meraki config.
 Does the cert have to be tied to any unique properties of the workstation (i.e. its name etc)? If so I assume we'll have to go through sorting out a gpo to trigger autoenrollment for each machine. Ideally (at least for the moment) we'd like to avoid that and simply use a certutil script to push a pfx of a cert from our CA to the selected workstations' personal computer store.
 Will this work or are there unique properties the cert has to have/match on the workstation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a set of applications on physical hardware that was stood up about 8 years ago - it has now come to the crunch point where this must be replaced, and I am tasked with virtualising the majority of it.
 It was all put on physical hardware at the time, because there was hardware purchased for another project that got cancelled, and it was up for grabs. It is pretty much all massively overspecced.
 I am now trying to figure out the sizing for ESXi VMs that I will need to replace these.
 I have Xymon (fka Hobbit) monitoring in place with stats going back 576 days which measures CPU, Memory, disk usage (among other things)
 I was thinking of basing my VMs on the peak values measured for these figures over the last 576 days, but a bit nervous since a lot of the values are tiny compared to the physical values.
 Especially since we have guideline sizings for virtual servers of this type which are massively above my measured values.
 What would be best practice here?
 Do you think these guidelines being rather large are to cope with potential spikes in usage we may see?
 An example, with CPU being the biggest problem here:
 My measured peak physical values CPU load 4 Mem 32GB
 My existing physical server CPU cores 16 Mem 64GB
 Reccommended VM sizing CPU cores 16 Mem 64GB

 The trouble I am having is coming up with the right combination and sweet spot for size, performance and overall cost and I thought this group is the right place to start asking the questions. Any help is appreciated, or kindly redirect me to the right place to ask the question (sorry if this is the wrong sub)
 Let me lay down some of the project's conditions:
  
We want our own hardware, colo is ok (no using BackBlaze etc)
 We need to buy/rent cabinet
 Factor in network costs with a 10GE ISP connection, no egress costs
 Include elictricity use
 Include OSS storage software
 Hybrid NVME/SSD and HDD
 Total size of storage should be at least 20TB, preferably 80-100TB minimum, max 500TB
 Total cost per TB needs to be less than $2 per month over 3 years.
 
 For example, a $10k server, plus $2k running costs per year on a 100TB server comes in at $36k for 3 years. 100/36 = $2.7 per TB over 36 months
 The above has way more costs, I just wanted to give an example. The goal is $2 or under per TB. 
 Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is not so much a technical question, more of a situational issue. My manager has finally put his retirement papers into HR. 
 Since then he has been a complete thorn in my supervisor's and mine side; update business critical software / created downtime without notifying our Tech director (update caused a critical API client to fail, ended up causing weekend work plus multiple tickets into the sofrware vendor), buildout systems / updates system in the incorrect order (leaving us to try to figure out why the systems are not working), hording of information has gotten worse (our director had to force him to start handing it over), he only renewed our TLS wildcard cert for 1 year (it takes 3 days, plus a week of bouncing emails between people to get the downtime lined up/approved with over departments, to update all of our systems)... It's been like this since he put in his retirement papers, and is getting worse.
 We tried to reason with him on some of these thing, like giving the devs 24hrs notice when we update there OS & software stacks on dev environments, got shot down on that one (the old "it's just dev not production, we can do it at anytime").
 It's almost to the point where we have to monitor what he does, sysadmin task wise, on every system.
 At this point kinda at a loss on how to handle this gently; supervisor and I still have to work with him for another 8 weeks, our Tech Director is at a loss too and is almost willing to pull our COO & CEO in to talk with him, worst part is he is the only IT manager that we have had (he has been here for 25 years).
 Where would you start with this mess?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a preestablished 2008 DFL/FFL domain contoso.com, on-prem, with 4 AD sites, 3 being physical locations, one being Azure.
 There are 3 DCs at our main location (2x 2008, 1x 2008 R2), 1 DC each at our satellite offices.
 We have a S2S tunnel set up between our main location and our single Azure network.
 I connect via VPN to our the router in our main office.
 Today, I stood up a Win2022 Azure Edition DC and put NPS (configured it for RADIUS for VPN auth) on it. That's literally it. No other changes were made.
 Shortly after, I started to be unable to RDP into any of our on-prem Win2008/R2 servers or any Win7 machines that were domain-joined. If I try with Win10 mstsc, I get "Your credentials did not work (the login attempt failed)"
 If I try using RDP on the Win2022 DC, I get "An internal error has occurred. Error code 0x4, extended error code 0x0."
 The hilarious bit is I can RDP into an on-prem WinXP VM sitting on a VMware hypervisor, and RDP from there to any of the on-prem machines I'm having trouble with. I can also RDP into any domain-joined VMs in Azure.
 I am completely stumped. Initially I thought NLA settings might somehow have changed on the on-prem servers, but I just checked one and it's set for lax NLA.
 Event viewer shows NOTHING. No persistent DFSR issues, nothing.
 dcdiag comes back clean on all DCs aside from irrelevant System log entries.
 UPDATE: It just started happening to the Azure DC as well, but it told me it was NLA, so I went and set SecurityLayer and UserAuthentication keys to 0 at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp using Remote Registry, and voila, I can now log on to an affected server.
 Obviously I'd prefer not to leave NLA off, any idea what might be causing this?

 We are evaluating encrypting and storing 200Tb of data with Backblaze. We would do the encryption on our side and just upload it...it would take 2-3 months!
 So that begs the question, in case of disaster, if we need the data back, it will also take 2-3 months to download. Seems unrealistic.
 How do you guys handle the transfer of such amounts of data and/or the backup ?

Each suit has it's own ISP connection and a Meraki MX and one AP since they have only 5 end uses at each suit.

I got about a week of training and have been learning on the job while still handling my previous responsibilities. Today we had my first setup where I was running point on adding new hosts and storage in a remote location. It had a few bumps in the road but at the end of the day I was able to migrate a VM to the new host and storage with no downtime! It was an awesome feeling when I saw the VM migrating to the new compute and storage with no interruption of service. It feels really good when it works.

 When I SSH to my server and do the same, it works. And I receive the test data. Pinging works from inside my server when I SSH. Ping does not work from outside my server, it just hangs. (from my normal terminal) 
 What I have tried: I have made sure to open port 80 via firewall settings on my VPS.

But over the past few years it has abated to the point that I have no motivation. I currently work for an MSP. I have been working here for 5 years, I am the top "tech". I am the guy that basically everyone goes to it they cant figure something out. I try to keep motivated to keep myself going but it just doesn't work anymore. I get snappy at people at work. Or just get agitated about stuff that use to I would just brush off.
 I also feel stagnant like I haven't grown as a tech in a couple of years. 
 I to somehow rekindle that spark and fire outside of work but nothing helps. Hell I have a few programming projects that are in some state of in progress, but when I attempt to start working on them I just cant. Hell even video games don't really interest me anymore. Use to I could hop on a game all weekend. Now I can't stay interested for more than 30 minutes.
 What have I lost in this respect and how to I get it back?

 Network A is "open" internet connected, running SNOW, DNAC. has about a thousand clients (wired and wireless) and maybe 500 servers.
 Network B is dark, and nothing in it should require the Internet. Comprised of 3x /16's running bgp, mpls, mesh devices across the operating area.
 Let's pretend money is no object, and support is critical. I've seen Netbox on prem briefly and am less than impressed; Infoblox has me curious so far. I also don't need the same system for both networks.
 Edit : minor clarifications

I want to know how these physical mediums are shared or not shared and how the ISP manages that. 
 I know a lot just comes from experience in the game or may be propreitary, but I'm hoping for books, youtube channels, etc. And if there are specific certifications I could look into, Im down for it. I know there was a CCNP or CCIE service prodiver cert which Ill look more into after this post.

 20 techs, spread over 16 states, a QUOTA of 13 tickets that need to be done a day. Below are the job responsibilities:
 -User account access, control, setup, and administration
 -Device deployments
 -Setting up MDFs for new sites; switches, servers, panels, cabling, punchdowns, as well as all config.
 -All basic desktop support tickets (printers, phones, cameras, user level issues, etc)
 -Software deployments, reinstalls, configurations
 All of this, plus basic help desk troubleshooting and remote reinstalls, troubleshooting, etc.
 For less than 25/hr.
 And needing to travel within a 6 hour radius to support other sites as needed.
 To me this raises huge red flags as a current Desktop Support dude who does, ya know, just desktop support stuff. This job looks like id be doing a sysadmin, netadmin, desktop, and help desk role for half the pay of what an admin would make.
 Plus a ticket QUOTA? I get SLAs and uptime. But quota? Is it just me or does this raise red flags to anyone else?

Have it on my Windows 10 machine and discovered its now on by default for Windows 11 and the users. That's fine, I can use it then. But whenever you try to run it as admin you get an error. Was doing the same on my Windows 10 machine. Why? It would appear its because it needs to be installed on the account you're trying to "runas".
 Anyone else get this issue? If I then login a laptop that gets the error as my domain admin, install Terminal for that account. Next time I'm logged on as the user and run Terminal as admin, it works fine.

Officially, I've been a Systems Administrator for 8 years and have been in IT for about 20 years. I am burned out, my boss is an asshole, I am underpaid, and over worked. I won't say where I work but I will say it's a state government agency. Some of you might know how difficult it may be in these kinds of environments with low budgets to work in. Anyway, I want to leave this place so I am looking for a new remote job. I finished a cloud computing program and learned AWS and Azure. It seems the best chance for me to land a new position is another Sys Admin role but one that utilizes cloud technologies. 
 I am slated to take my AWS solutions architect exam next month. I am having a heck of a time landing a new job despite many positions constantly getting posted. I don't know guys...2022 has been brutal for me. My wife had cancer and is a victim of medical malpractice. I support my family and I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I will probably post my resume over at r/sysadminresumes because I can't afford a professional resume service. (they're stupid expensive). I guess I'm just venting. My mental health is shot. Sorry for the rant. I just feel like crying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well folks, I've officially broke production it seems. I inherited a very broken Enterprise PKI, and in an attempt to get it to re-publish the CDP Location and DeltaCRL location, I renewed the root cert. 
 I was sure to not generate a new public / private key pair. However after making that change users were no longer able to update group policy facing an error saying: "...processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of connectivity to a domain controller..." and "... Windows could not authenticate to the Active Directory service on a domain controller. (LDAP Bind function call failed)..."
 Upon looking at gpresult, it shows a few errors including: "The system call to get account information completed. The call failed after 0 milliseconds" and "Error: Retrieved account information. Error code 0x5." and "The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows could not resolve the computer name..."
 DNS appears to be fine, and the computers are able to ping the DC's, and the domain itself with no issue. Looking at the DC's logs, there are many Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center errors saying "While processing an AS request for target service krbtgt, the account {laptop_name} did not have a suitable key for generating a Kerberos ticket (the missing key has an ID of 1). The requested etypes : 18. The accounts available etypes : 23 18 17. Changing or resetting the password of {laptop_name} will generate a proper key."
 ​
 I'd really appreciate any tips or help you folks can offer. So far people have just been unable to update group policy, but I bet authentication issues are close to follow due to the cached credentials. We're likely on borrowed time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the use case:
 We are building up a network segmentation with VLAN's and a NAC sollution (everything Aruba). Our main switches are secured in IT rooms or closed network closet. So we can secure these switches and ports. 
 ​
 But in different area's we don't have sufficiënt cabling so we have to use "desk" switches. Now we found models for these "desk" switches that are capable and working with 802.1x authentication to properly set the correct VLAN at the correct port. 
 Now comes my problem; the uplink port/cable is not secured and the next upward switch port allows tagged VLAN traffic. So basically if anyone brings in a VLAN cabable switch (or in worst case resets the desk switch) is able to bypass the 802.1x security. 
 ​
 Is their any way to detect and block these rogue switches on these uplink ports? (We are an engineering company with people whom are well capabel of dooing this, and as IT we want to be one step a head of this).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently deployed a F5 LTM load balancer to front some Atlassian applications. It seem to be working correctly, but the overall performance is considerably slower than going direct to the services themselves. We are not proxying any SSL. Just a straight tcp connection to the pool servers. The LTM is setup in a one arm mode, hanging off the same firewall as the servers are behind, so the traffic is flowing through the same path, whether it is direct or load balanced.
 Any thoughts?

 l2vpn xconnect group test1 p2p traffic_a interface HundredGigE0/0/0/20.22 interface HundredGigE0/0/0/30.22 ! p2p group traffic_b interface HundredGigE0/0/0/21.44 interface HundredGigE0/0/0/31.44 ! ! 
 Then only traffic from those sub interfaces can communicate with each p2p connection. This works well but I cant figure out how to do the same in Junos. I think I need to create a pvlan aka private-vlans.
 I think I create sub interfaces that tag on the vlan ids I want, then create two sperate private-vlans for the traffic correct?
 If anyone can create some examples that would be helpful. QFX ports I am working with are 
 xe-0/0/20.22 <-> xe-0/0/30.22 xe-0/0/21.44 <-> xe-0/0/31.44

How do you cope everyday with waking up and doing the same thing over and over again for the sake of money, when all you really want is to be able to play Elden Ring in your underwear and go grab an ice cream in the middle of the week in the midst of day with your girlfriend and then get in a car and travel on a road trip if your heart desires?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a design question only, and not specific to a current hardware implementation - this is educational (for me) only
 Say you have a small business that has Internet access. It has a router and a firewall. The firewall is multi-homed, connecting to the Internet router, the internal LAN and has an interface supporting a DMZ. You have a public facing Web server on the DMZ. You have a ERP server on the DMZ. 
 Now you want to provide remote access, so you are looking to install an IPSec VPN server. I am assuming the VPN server would be connected to the DMZ. Say you used Cisco AnyConnect or Palo Alto Global Connect, or even OpenVPN - would you port forward from the firewall to the VPN server on the VPN? Say the VPN server has two interfaces. Would one connect to the DMZ and the other to the internal LAN? Or would you get a separate WAN connection and use that for connecting to the VPN server?
 So router --> firewall --> VPN Server on DMZ --> where does this connect?

Without IPSec on the tunnel, EIGRP comes up just fine, but as soon as I place tunnel protection back on, it breaks.. Not sure whats the issue since both sides match up...
 EDIT:
 It looks like there was something up with that specific router, I just applied that same configuration to a newer router (ISR4431) and it came up just fine lol. Thanks everyone for your help!

 I have about a dozen licenses, charged at $16.99 billed monthly on an annual contract.
 Went to add another one and it jumped from $16.99 to $23.99, looks like either the price just increased across the board, or they split the tiers, because now Adobe Acrobat Standard is $14.99 vs. Pro which is now $23.99.
 Review the feature list here to see if you really need to stay on Pro come renewal: Business pricing & plans | Enterprise licenses | Adobe Acrobat 
 I will be downgrading all my licenses at renewal because it is absolutely not worth the extra cost for those handful of extra features (at least in my use case).
 Hopefully this saves a few people from getting auto locked into a new contract at the higher price unexpectedly.

 I currently have an application web server in my DMZ. The server has every port on and is closed off from the internet, but it still can't access files on the application server it's based off of. The DNS requests it is sending are timing out. DNS and firewalls are not my speciality, I'm a hardware guy that got pushed into a sole admin job. So I do not know the most secure way to give a DMZ server access to DNS requests and SMB requests so that it can access the files that it needs to. This is the only server inside the DMZ other than the firewall interface itself. It's a Palo alto firewall as well. 
 Once the DNS requests can finish out I can packet sniff to find the exact ports I need to be able to run it, but I can't do that with out that DNS requests finishing out. 
 ALSO: important! *** If anyone works in dental laboratory technology they would know exactly what application web server I'm trying to setup as it is a standard in the industry and could probably help way better based off of the way they set up theirs. Though any general knowledge of this stuff would most likely help. 
 Thanks! TeethandTechnology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I swear I have tried to search for hits on this topic (here on Reddit and also via Google) and keep coming up empty. I have a situation in which a company is asking me how much I would charge them to have my certification status registered under them. Basically, they need someone in their corporate account that is holding three different technical certifications that I have or can get fairly easily (all three certs are very much my main focus in IT for the past 15+ years.). A friend of mine has told me that a colleague we both have in common will often do this for 5K for a 12 month agreement. I have heard of even higher numbers, which is mind boggling to me. But, as my friend explained, because incentives and sales discounts are often predicated on what status a company holds with a major vendor, these expenses of borrowing someone's certification status will often pay for themselves in very short time. I guess I am simply trying to understand what is reasonable based on the experience of others in here. Also, anything I should think about before agreeing to do this? Open to all feedback!

How is onboarding working in these best practice environnements, which GPOs are created, what´s the OU structure, how do they handle publice folders on exchange, how do they handle the issue with Karen.
 And than I think "ah fuck it, other networks are much more a fucking mess".

 But I am still curious what other best practice environments might look like, or near best practice.
 So far I have not met an admin who is 99% satisfied with his network.

 Thought popped into my head today...I advertise an IPv4 /16 to the world. We get a lot of trash at our doorstep....by that I mean port scanners and whatnot.
 But it's easy to enumerate IPv4. There's only so many IP's. 65,536, to be exact, in a /16.
 Is this such a problem in IPv6? We have a /40 and haven't started advertising any of it yet.
 There's a few more IP address in a /40 ( 309,485,009,821,345,068,724,781,056) than in a /16. It seems like trying to scan/sweep an address space that large would be futile. Are scanners even bothering to try?

 I have seen a few from Kramer that can be customised. If anyone is familiar with them or has used them I would be very keen to hear if they are worth their price as they do seem costly.
 My other concern would be that we use UK-type plugs that are quite a bit larger than US ones. Kramer does have universal power sockets. But this raises another concern
 The cable for UK plugs exits from the bottom of the plug while US cables generally exit from the back of the plug (Opposite to the socket) therefore the cable can get in the way.
 Any help would be appreciated
 The Kramer items I am looking at are here:

 Can I make WebMin not spin up sleeping HDD's? Not until I specifically request up-to-date HDD status information or something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 what is the cheapest and best way to store large amounts of company data? And with large amount, I mean roughly 700GB which I know some of you probably laugh about, but for our company that is the limit and my employer does not want to just buy more memory and I have to somehow make room for new data right now. The data right now is stored on a terminal server within a cloud and I don't know their price models but apparently it is kinda expensive to upgrade memory i guess.
 I have never engaged with data storage, backups or archiving before so I have no experience. We have the options of theoretically buying and installing our own backup server as we still have a lot of room in our server rack. Alternatively we could use some cloud option but I have the feeling that we would pay too much for something very simple. 
 Also which OS would you use to make it simple and efficient? Is there some kind of linux distribution specializing in data backups/ archives? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 I want to mount those on a computer at work, but how do I define which one to mount?
 They're both password protected with different usernames.
 I was thinking something like this:
 \\172.0.0.1\[COMPUTER-NAME]\folder
 Or just signing in with the wanted username, or using WORKGROUP (I have no idea how that works)
 This is a theory, will it work? Will the two computers fight over the port?

 What I tried is to add  "exclude" : [ "+ /home/user1/**", "+ /root/**", "+ /home/user2/**", ],  to /etc/timeshift.json as per this post but the files within those folders still aren't included in the backup.
 Just in case this is an XY problem, are there other ways to reprovision a machine with a previous configuration with little to no interaction.

 I'm currently auditing AD accounts for a customer.n The customer has over 1,000 servers and several thousand AD accounts, specifically functional accounts, some were created over 15 years ago.
 So probably somebody could answer those question:
  
We have several accounts that don't have a last logon time stamp. Is it save to assume that those can be disabled / deleted? Or is there a scenario where they are still used for something but don't get this time stamp?
 
We have accounts that are used as group mailboxes / resources. Can I disable them and they could still be used by people who have the right delegated?

 The hacker did following
 1: Got user password
 2: Bypass the 2FA, seems user click yes is me by mistake (We disable this new 2FA system of office 365)
 3: In the email with wire they include the user correct number, the bank call to the legit owner phone and somebody pick up and confirm wire - This is the part I don't understand how in hell they did it. We called the phone provider and got a new sim, but they said they have no idea how it is possible, because is not the hacker did not get his number port or similar.
 How is it possible the hacker got hacked and intervene his phone calls? His Iphone is not jailbroken, so my understanding is that it is very difficult to hack it but even if they install something, are you able to pick up certain calls? 
 The phone provider reset account password and pin, but I don't think the fixes it anything. 
 This seems very sophisticated.

 I only have one IP route set, 172.16.1.0/24, with the gateway marked as direct (ends in .254), I've only got the one switch, no stacking is enabled and it's a fresh firmware image yet again with no luck. 
 It's got to be something simple, I just need someone to actually point me to the right thing.

In the office they have USB-C docks with large dual monitor setups.
 The Head of BDM hired a graphic designer part time 3 days per week. Requested a MacBook Pro and I said no for many reasons. Gave the designer Creative Cloud on a X1 Carbon G10 with the same specs as above.
 However, after a couple of months again they are agitating for a MAcBook. She said "Person A is finding that is a little inefficient to use the PC for graphic design".
 I understand that some people think they are really cool and special individuals to use a Mac, but is there really a major advantage to using it for graphic design?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey team,
 We have a Win11 Pro environment and am testing upgrades to Win11 as well as new deployments.
 I have been successful in implementing policies to remove the Chat, Widgets icon etc but the last thing I can't figure out is the unholy amount of bloat apps pinned to the start menu by default. TikTok, ClipChamp, Amazon Prime etc. 
 These apps are not technically installed, but install once clicked without any MS Account etc. I want to remove all of these apps except the relevant Windows apps (Notepad, Settings, etc etc) from the start menu pinned section. 
 I need this to work for existing user profiles. Happy to run a script or change registry keys to remove this stuff. We are not an environment that uses MS Edge, Teams, etc. 
 I have attempted to edit XMLs and JSON start layouts to no success. I was able to edit the start layout to remove most of these apps but this only worked for new profiles and even then, ClipChamp and Xbox kept appearing despite being removed. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any guidance.

 ​
 I wanted to reach out and see if anyone else has encountered this and if you found a way to remediate/correct the issue? The users in my environment should be prompted to register their device when they attempt to sign in with their org credentials. I cant figure out why some devices are failing to populate an owner/principal user. 
 ​
 Any thoughts or speculations is much appreciated.

First time using IOS on anything. I’ve been brought into a project and have been tasked with configuration of this and I am trying to make it easier on myself. I’ve configured other routing platforms all with their own UI’s, but configuring IOS via the CLI seems a bit difficult at first glance. Nothing I couldn’t handle with some browsing, but just trying to make my life easier. So, any help from seasoned Cisco people and/or people seasoned with Cisco’s software suite would be very much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR; at the bottom. 
 So I’ll give more information than I usually do about myself. I’d studied network engineering which has been my goal for years. I was hired on by Dell before I finished my courses and decided to dedicate myself to their company. The job became fully remote and I started going nuts around 6 years. It was fun at first but man, I just need people around me. 
 I had experience with network engineering from reading the bulky books but hardly anything was applied experience because I was hired on with Dell. I tried to segue into enterprise but even after years it was difficult to get in. I learn best by doing things, reading just doesn’t stick. I was outperformed by many who were smart as a whip. 
 I’ve left Dell and landed a job at Charter/Spectrum - this is my first week. I feel totally lost as I’ve forgotten many things. I’ve been working on client computers for so long that it’s all I know. I plan to utilize the offers for CCNA and JDCNA to get back on my path but for now I’m focused on just kicking ass through my training. 
 My main question is which areas to focus on in an enterprise tech support role here (I’m being trained on many things I don’t have experience with). The CLI for now is superputty and I’m trying to use my CMD and PS experience as much as possible. To be honest though I’m just a little intimidated. 
 TLDR; Hired into enterprise customer support. Hoping for suggestions on what to learn after I clock out daily. I’m looking for network engineering or cloud admin areas. My new company doesn’t have 1x1 type meetings to assess career paths. I’ll read anything y’all suggest, thanks guys.

 They get random emails from gmail addresses that look like this. I don't know if its only gmail, but all three examples I've seen so far have been. https://imgur.com/a/l77h7oh
 This is a legit email for the client. The odd thing is that when I check their anti-spam logs (they use Barracuda ESS) I can see the message there looks fine, and can even download a copy where the original message is in tact.
 Has anyone seen anything like this before? Kind of stumped. They use Office 365 for their email in a hybrid setup. On-prem Exchange server is running Exchange 2016 CU22.

 I have a Sonicwall TZ300, and I want to connect that to the MR6400 to provide internet to the entire office. Normally, the Sonicwall would connect to an Openreach vdsl modem. Our fibre lines have been destroyed by some construction workers.
 I'm not great with networking, and I can't figure out the correct way to do this. I've got a 4G USB dongle arriving tomorrow which will do the same thing, so if I can't get this figured out today it'll just have to wait until then.
 So far, I've assigned a static IP to one of the TZ300's interfaces and connected that to a LAN port of the MR6400, in the same subnet. (192.168.1.0/24) I've tried to create a static route on the Sonicwall to route all traffic to the MR6400 (source/destination any, default gateway the IP of the MR6400)
 I'm very much out of my depth here. How can I use the MR6400 purely as a modem for the TZ300?

 Looking to have to bin 2012 next year. Coinciding this with an office move, we'll end up with a spare piece of tin which is currently using 2012, but my plan is to put 2022 on it (if it's capable) and use it as the primary DC on our domain. Issue is, I can't find any info if there are any compatibility issues with replication (DFS/AD) to an older version. We currently have 4 other sites which are on 2012/2012R2 for now.
 Also noticed the upgrade path can now go 2012 > 2022 directly, anyone had experience of how well this goes?

However it will happen again a few times throughout the day. All affected users are using different models of Dell latitude
 We have tried the below troubleshooting but in most cases it doesn't make a difference.
  
office quick repair
 office online repair
 updating all reccomended drivers from Dell support assist
 reinstalling office
 dism restore health followed by sfc scannow until no errors are found
 reset PC
  
In many cases resetting the PC fixes it but not all cases. One common denominator is that all the users experiencing this are using docking stations with an ethernet connection. Not sure if this can affect anything but it is a common denominator so it may be worth mentioning.
 Could anyone perhaps point me in the right direction of how I could troubleshoot this? This issue seems to be unique to one of the many clients we support so it must be something in their environment that is causing it
 Edit: the PC's are all cloud joined to azure AD and managed by intune

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 So this post is specifically about Residential Proxy Providers who sell ISP proxies(sourced from ISPs), but all knowledge that can help is welcome.
 So, I feel there is a good demand for residential proxies in the proxy market. Most providers are resellers and there are only a handful of providers who actually own the infra and source and host the proxies themselves.
 From my research these ISP proxy providers get IPs from ISPs and then host the proxies themselves for which they need both hardware and software. the IPs are already announced on the ASN of the ISP which gives them the ISP type IP.
 Now, I have some questions about these handful of providers.
 ​
  
What kind of hardware do they own? How is the hardware mapped and how does it work together?
 Does the ISP give them access to a server that the ISP owns with the bought IPs connected?(some B2B providers sell like this)
 Or, do they need to have their own servers and they lay the cables from the ISP datacenter to their servers and host the proxies there?
 What software do they use to host? Is it the normal squid for http/https and dante for SOCKS? I'd assume they write their own software. So,
 What is the prerequisite knowledge to write that software? I suppose its socket programming(correct me if I am wrong).
 Lastly, What is the cost of the hardware for hosting lets say a /20? Both one time and periodic costs.
  
I am sorry if my questions aren't specific, but I would be really glad if you all could answer them in detail. Have a good day!

But my real question comes down to the Security Filtering. I did not change it from the default "authenticated users". Do I need to add my Domain Users as well? When I do a Gpupdate and then Gpresult it does not show up as an Applied GPO.

Apps such as Teams, Slack and Policy-Pak will no longer run, but instead popup a blue box that says "This app has been blocked by your system administrator."
 I've seen a little bit of chatter about it online, but nothing on this forum unless I missed it. Here's a link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1081649/administrator-restriction-after-install-kb5019959.html
 The applocker solution is worthless to us... applocker is not configured.
 Anyone else seeing this? Before we allow updates to go out to the whole org, we want to be sure there is some kind of fix for this.

 Is a new WSUS server the better option?

On Saturday:
  
Install Zero-day and critical security patches Immediately
 Install Cumulative and optional updates 1 month after release.
 Install Feature updates (20H1, 20H2, etc ) about 3 months after release.

 I have never been drawn into anything Citrix related, and am currently trying to shift my focus into infosec as much as possible to eventually switch into that field permanently as I find it much more interesting and it’s something I really want to base my career on right now, probably related to redteaming and pentesting.
 However, until a security related team is formed in my current company, I still have to carry on with the regular sysadmin duties, and recently my supervisor has been nudging the more Citrix knowledgeable person to teach others the ropes of Citrix and one other topic I can’t discuss here, and he specifically said I should also know these things, and I just feel like I don’t want to become ’that guy’ for things I am not really interested in.
 Thus I come to you, /r/sysadmin, for guidance. Should I mention not wanting to get too deep into Citrix or keep my head down and do as I’m told? I work in Europe so worker’s rights are really good here and I doubt anyone would consider letting me go for saying such things (although I am on probation still), but I just don’t know how to handle this situation. All i want is to not become the go-to-guy for something I have no interest in.
 Maybe there is something I’m also missing about Citrix stuff? It just never seemed too interesting to me, I find other hypervisor platforms more interesting and fun to work with.

 I'm thinking just rename the folder (or in this case because I shared the exact directory so a rename would remove the share, make a sub directory and re-point there during the upgrade, then I have an easy level to rename next time without breaking the share)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. 
 I have pretty much no knowledge about networking but trying to fix a problem in work. We have a control unit on our furnaces which was connected to a laptop via Ethernet that displays all data and history on the program we use. The laptops battery has bulged massively so I’ve decided to rearrange the previous workers setup and I installed an ssd in the pc I use in here as well, hoping to run the program and work network all from the same pc. I bought a switch which both the network and furnace control unit are connected to. I’ve successfully managed to connect to the network but i cannot ping the control Unit. After reading a bit about switches I can understand the problem but no idea how to fix it. The unit has its completely separate ip address. I’m assuming when pinging, it’s trying to find the ip on the network. Is there anyway I can fix this and connect to the control unit ? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 my boss asked me to do a cleanup of our backup structure. So there is one folder with many subfolders and countless files in it. So many that you can't even run ls anymore.
 I now need to clean this up somehow. Means i need to delete all files in all folders that exceed a certain fileage.
 What's the best way to do this? The folder itself is mounted into our filesystem from our NAS.
 I guess it will be best to do it on the NAS itself but i probably need to programm something myself, i have Python 2.7.5 available there or shell.
 ​
 But perhaps there is a better solution out there?
 Thanks for tips and help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next May, we’ll be coming to a cliff-edge with full enforcement of strong certificate mapping.
 I know people reported issues of the new OID not issuing with offline templates (used by SCEP) which is used to plant the SID for strong mapping.
 I’m slightly concerned as I’m planning a few deployments with SCEP - and I’m not sure what the best way would be to ensure that strong mapping is met for device certificates (for HAADJ) and user certificates (for AADJ).
 At the moment, my go-to configs are:
  
Device certificates are issued with CN/SAN of {{DeviceName}}$@domain.local
 User certificates are issued with CN/SAN of {{UserPrincipalName}}
  
Obviously, these aren't going to be acceptable come May 2023 and Intune's certificate connector has no native capability to carry out the mapping.
 With it being pivotal for Wi-Fi and VPN authentication, I don’t envision it being a fun time for those who haven’t met the strong mapping criteria come May 2023. Disappointing Microsoft haven't addressed this six months on, especially when they are pushing people to AADJ which is heavily dependent on user certificates through SCEP for on-prem access.
 Anyone care to share their wisdom on the topic?
 Thanks.

 I've found one post on here where the OP installed more RAM but that can't be the fix can it?

 My boss asked me if it would be possible to create a ticketing system with database integration since we need to keep track of the support we offer to the customers when dealing with problems with the specialiced devices we sell. I basically need a ticketing system that can display data stored in our projects and clients database so when our support agents have to resolve something they can submit the ticket chosing in which project, client and device the issue has appearead, what caused it and how they solved it.
 i made a basic ticketing system for the IT department that works using forms and a few power automate flows, but something like this is not going to cut it for this project.
 I've checked some options like freshdesk which i've seen has integration with microsoft sql which is the DB engine we use, and seems pretty solid and intuitive, but I'd like to have a couple more options to compare and make a more informed decision.

 Google all I can and tested all I can think of… but with no luck, and the problem only occurs randomly. Computers are Win 10. 
 GPO for cached credentials is OK and if I remove all cached credentials, I can see that it cache when I sing in with a user.
 Tested to re-join a computer, same problem.
 Got the same problem on a new installed computer 
 Anyone have any tips or ideas what to do?

 I am trying to deploy scheduled tasks on my Windows Servers via GPO.
 But this only works if I specify "SYSTEM" account to run the task. When I specify any other user, the task is not created on the server.
 Is this a "standard" behavior and is it not possible to create task that will run with classic user ?
 I need to launch some tasks with a specific user because the script needs to access network ressources.
 It happens the same if I create a User GPO instead.
 Is it possible to create a scheduled task via GPO that runs as specific user ?

Ability to limit the internal servers that can submit messages.
 Route messages to different upstream SMTP servers depending on the address
 Have a GUI (if it's Linux based)
 An on-premise solution
  
I looked at the IIS relay in Windows Server but it can't achieve option 2 unless the server has multiple IP addresses (unless I have missed something!).
 We can't direct send over the internet unfortunately. We need an internal relay.
 Please can you guys suggest possible solutions please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a indie hacker making small tools that people might find useful and use. Currently I use PaaS software like Heroku for all of them, but it's getting expensive.
 How much work is it to maintain and secure a web server running for example multiple indie Ruby on Rails apps with Postgres?
 What if the data is sensitive? 
 Should I just pony up the $$ for a PaaS (often paid per project, which is the painpoint for me), or is it worth keeping my own server to be able to run basically infinite hobby projects on (unless they start scaling, but then I can always deal with that?).
 Back in 2005-ish I used to run and maintain a few servers on Hetzner (I'm in Europe). They just had my personal stuff, so I didn't stress too much about security, but tried to keep them semi up-to-date with aptitude (although I was quite often behind) and lately also using SSH keys. I don't know much more than that about running a server, to be honest, but I'm willing to learn if it's not too much work.

 We send an email to all our users stating that the VPN is down and that IT is working on it, and that a follow up will be sent once the service is back up and running.
 24h later I still get emails, teams, calls from users that they cannot connect to the VPN, even after sending a second email that it has still not been fixed.
 Some of them still read the email on day one, and still go on their WFH the day after asking to find an urgent solution...
 How hard is it to read an email and comprehend the implications of an outage ?
 How do you communicate important information to your users ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 This isn't a bashing thread or anything like that. It is purely out of curiosity and idea gathering.
 So how do your company deal with new hires and people who leave?
 I wonder how other people do it, since our way is most definitely not the best or right way.
 This is our process for when they join:
  
The management hire a guy.
 The person is then added to salary list.
 The same day as the person starts, IT is informed that the person needs tons of equipment.
  
This is our process for when they leave:
  
Someone hears from someone, that X is no longer here.
 Economics gets informed about this.
 The employee gets removed from salary list.
 Sometimes months later, HR and IT gets informed about this.
  
We have tried to make a simple formular that asks all the right questions, that managers has to fill out when hiring a new guy. But often people forget to do it.
 We do not have such thing for when an employee leaves though. Not yet at least.
 ​
 My initial idea, was to add some sort of information message to managers, when I run my user disabling script.
 Or make some sort of formular, where it will send out an e-mail containing some basic information of the person quitting, so that it will trigger some script that will then run all the basics, and inform all the relevant people.
 Preferably a way where no one has to remember anything specific, other than maybe click a button.
 ​
 But I am not trying to get a discussion going on how bad we handle it, instead I am trying to get some ideas from other people in the same field. What is good? What works well? What is not recommended etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is clearly a trail of thoughts about the transition and the opportunities (not) from helpdesk to junior/mid admin. I’m not looking for “the answer” just want to rant about it because I had enough!
 By this time, I believe it’s almost impossible to make it, no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, study or do things just to learn, either the companies or the “co-workers” trying to push back and pull you down.
 There’s clearly no way out of the hell of helpdesk and if they labeled you as a junior admin, you are just a glorified helpdesk with a global admin account to just reset password, formatting the workstations and update the god-damn antivirus or fixing the f*@#$ng printer!
 No matter what or how you study, pay for yourself online trainings or a Pluralsight or whatever, getting certified with new technologies, setting up a lab on your own, nothing matters as it seems.
 The companies want someone with 10years experience and be the one man show and pay him as a junior. The seniors “co-workers” just don’t want you to learn and mess around with their stuff even if you are doing it alright and actually helping them, even if you are hired to do system tasks, they throw you back on the helpdesk pit for the d2d, because “you are more experienced with that” and you'll endup doing something actual worth doing maybe once in a couple of weeks.
 And let me ask you, how should I be more experienced if you do not give me a proper task or a chance to learn and do some actual work on a corporate environment, even if I do correctly everything you ask so far no matter how big the task was?
 Is it too much to ask? Getting paid decent money and doing the work you suppose to do on the role they hired you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked quite a lot with integrating things into the network at the edge, and by various business functions. It also seems to me that besides very different business functions at the edge, there can be various actors needing to operate at the edge for example either as different company entities under the same umbrella, different companies operating due to subcontracting or other business/organizational reasons.
 Just thought that it might be convenient to "virtualize" switches and assign a set of ports to adhere to different access control schemes or perhaps to completely act as isolated virtual switches, but within the same switch hardware to conserve resources.
 I've never heard of such implementations, but has anyone had similar thoughts or what kind of solutions do you usually go for in cases where shared hardware would be cost-effective but difficult to implement?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, that happened just now. Funny story time:
 A client I really like helping (they really appreciate the work I do for them) rings up in a bit of a flap. "i'm watching my emails disappearing in front of me, I think i've been hacked!"
 I say "OK, shut down and I'll check access logs". I check access logs, nothing other than his mobile and their IP. OK, not that then.
 I ring him up and say turn your computer on and I'll have a look. Turns out he didn't turn his computer off, just closed Outlook. Whatever.
 I open up Outlook, and check his inbox. Sure enough, emails are disappearing really quickly!
 OK, maybe he's accidentally archived emails newer than 1 second or something? Nope, no archives.
 OK I check his deleted folder to see if they're going there, and there they are - only they're being deleted there too!!!
 I check another folder, WHOA! they're being deleted there as well!
 What about Online? SAME!!! OH CRAP!!!!!! I'm thinking quickly. What could it be???
 Maybe it's a rule? OK I'll check that. I open up the rules, and I struggle to do anything. It won't let me click.
 It's then that I notice that the tabs across the top are flashing as though someone's got tab pressed. So I call the customer, and say "is something on your keyboard???"
 He gives it a thump, and suddenly, emails stop deleting. It was his keyboard, the delete (and possibly Tab) key was stuck or are faulty.
 Overall, it wasn't a long time - about 20 minutes. But I feel like I only thought of the solution because of Silicon Valley:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDK8tMyCic
 Turns out, 15 folders and over 10,000 items got deleted. I know this, because my powershell script to restore them capped out at 10,000 cos I forgot to add -resultsize unlimited at the end...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,I originally posted this on on r/sophos but also wanted to get a more "networking" guidance..
 We are going through an SG to XG (Firewall) migration with a twist of also removing an outside Cisco ASA. Our Sophos SG is our internal gateway to all of our vlans so the Sophos XG will be the same. We would like to put the two in parallel so that we can slowly migrate a few vlans over at a time, but are struggling with the gateway/routes part.
 Without changing all our IP's and to keep gateways the same - are we best to create a new vlan exclusive for routing all traffic from the XG to the SG?
 For example we disable vlan 2 on SG 192.168.2.1, we then enable vlan 2 on the XG 192.168.2.1But our domain controllers and remainder of our environment is on the SG. So do we static route interface vlan 2 to the IP of the SG? How will it know how to process vlan 2 traffic if the vlan is turned off?
 Our aim is to pick one on prem application at a time and essentially test it before going live. And with everything live and in parallel we can log into the SG and Cisco ASA to compare rules and figure out where the config is incorrect on the Sophos XG.
 Any help or guidance would be appreciated.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pair of Cisco ASR1001 routers with 4GB of ram each. My neighboring bgp peer is advertising full bgp routes to me, this killed my routers memory. So I configured a route map to block prefixes in except for default route if it was being distributed. (It wasn’t ☹️ ) I noticed that the route map denied 2,753,559 prefixes which seemed to be an excessive amount. I’m guess this excessive amount of routes is due to their blended circuits with full bgp routes so I’m probably receiving all the prefixes with multiple paths and that’s the reason the prefixes are 2.7M ?
 Also in terms of memory will the ASR1001 non X edition support 16GB of ram (2x8 GB) or is it only 4GB sticks with a maximum of 8GB? All content online seems to only talk about 1001X.

 We run Exchange Server 2016 on-prem and will be migrating to Exchange Online (EXO) in the near future. It's about 300 users with 4TB-ish of data and some overly critical public folder mailboxes as well. Ideal end state is a hybrid setup, as we do have some legacy servers that need SMTP access. In addition, inbound mail will still go through Mimecast prior to being delivered to EXO.
 Since we are a small team, we engaged with an MSP to provide a quote to do some of the migration. They provided a "get your tenant configured to best practices and migrate data" quote in the six figure range. That seems very high to me based on the scope of work provided. 
 Those of you who have done this migration, is it six-figures difficult? Also is the use of BitTitan (or similar) really necessary or can the built in migration tools do the job just as well? Having not run through the process I'd like to hear any feedback you may have. 
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too complex?
 First EVER post on Reddit. I’m a newb network engineer with 3ish years experience. I deal with nexus, firepower, asa, catalyst, and many other brands/versions. I have worked extremely hard the past three years to be where I am and I know a decent amount. The more I turn to certifications and learning current tech, the more I get discouraged and have imposter syndrome. Does anyone else think we are getting way too complex? I mean SD-WAN, APIs on network equipment, vxlan, cloud, multi context firewalls, or multi context per say with nexus. I mean I find the GUI weird and prefer cli. Thanks to firepower and DNA, it’s moving to GUI. Maybe I’m just way too new and dumb at the moment, but I feel like a a lot of this is just craze on hype terms. Also, how do we keep up with all of this? There is no way to know it all. 
 Please let me know you’re thoughts!

No need for any of the applications or services that you would see you see in a typical corporate or educational campus.

To be honest I dont know how to study for this exam . I can deloy any of the products I talked about except ESA with all of its features. is that enough? or do I need more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: If any of y'all work for ManageEngine, tell the techs to stop fighting for remote control.
 I've had the disproportionately unpleasant experience of working with their techs remotely in probably 20 occasions now. Of those, about half were unproductive, and 4 were straight up infuriating.
 Listen, if your remote access software does not allow me to immediately and consistently take over control from a tech, your remote access software is complete thrash. It's beyond thrash, as it would be more apt to call it malware.
 The amount of times I've had a tech veer off and start making unapproved changes to a production server are ridiculous. One guy straight up navigated away from the ME window and started uninstalling unrelated apps before I straight up spammed Ctrl+Alt+Del. Despite obviously fighting for mouse control for a full 10 seconds so I could even type a message to him, he continued trying to do it. 
 It took me essentially swearing at him in caps (once I had control) for him to apologize and start asking permission before he made any further changes.
 This happened on 4 different occasions with 4 different techs. Baffling. I have some text now I paste to preemptively let them know what the expected etiquette is.
 I despise being a dick to techs, but gotdamn.
 Serves me right for not using a jump RDP to facilitate support.

We are using EAP chaining for wired only and once machine authenticated it has access to the basic AD, DNS etc and once user is authenticated it gets dynamic access to relavent vlan and dacl based on AD group. Now the problem is normally user are connected on wireless which isn't using chaining and only AD username password are used. If user password is expired and they change it while being on wireless they won't be able to get access to network and login to the laptop until their laptop is connected back to wired after password reset. 
 Any idea what could be the issue? Please need your help, I'm banging my head.

 I am in a position where I am clearly putting in more work than was discussed on signing of my contract for my pay rate. Without going into too much detail (but I will if you guys ask), the project is extremely understaffed and I am an extremely important asset to the success of this project, as I know the ins and outs of it all. All the new people we hire keep quitting because they cant handle the fire or maybe they realize the pay doesn't justify the stress.
 Do you think its possible I can go to my contractor and explain to them that we (the contracting company and I) should push for a higher compensation? I know everyone is replacebale, even if I'm not exaggerating about my contributions.
 I think the smartest thing to do would be to just start interviewing again, and then use the new offer as leverage if I decided to stay. What do you guys think?

 In any case it got me wondering, what’s on your wishlist to increase operational efficiency? Here’s mine: 
 • Additional resources so tier 2/3 can actually focus on strategic tasks and not end user support 
 • More self service (catalog/bot) ++ if we can create micro experiences for users here
 • Stronger processes and training 
 • HRIS and IT directory to be in sync

 She was angry about it. Why should she have to submit a ticket every time there's a problem when her desk is right outside the data closet where the IT guy sits??? She's "special" so she shouldn't have to use that damned ticketing system.
 I tried to calm her, I explained the importance of a ticketing system, and after 30 minutes or so, she finally came around and now I think the IT guy owes me a drink at the next Christmas party....
 It is always good to get the end users perspective from time to time, and more importantly, the ability to explain things in a way that doesn't end with me sleeping on the couch!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to wrap my head around this:
 We have a Cisco ASA 5515-X. And we use a static NAT rule with automatic address translation rules to direct HTTPS traffic to a specific web server on one of our LANs. This works fine from the Internet and LANs behind the ASA but does not work from our other /29 static WAN IPs from separate routers.
 From our ISP handoff we connect all of our routers outside interfaces to an 8-port unmanaged switch. We do have an ACL in the ASA to allow HTTPS to this server as it works from the Internet without issue. The issue is any traffic from our other 3 routers/networks using this /29 WAN IP range can't access HTTPS on this server. These /29 WAN IPs rightfully do NOT go out to the Internet and know their next hop is another router on this unmanaged switch.
 It looks like traffic is being blocked by a 'rpf-check' subtype on the HTTPS static NAT rule.
 nat (inside,outside) static interface service tcp https https
 So maybe I'm using the wrong NAT setup, or some traffic isn't being matched so it's being blocked by an implicit rule?
 What we are trying to do is to allow users of these other networks to access our websites on this web server. This used to work when we had a different ISP, but they were very different static WAN IPs with the old ISP and not from the same /29 range.
 P.S. I know the ASA 5515-X is end of life and we are working on replacing it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a bit of a long-shot, but does anyone have learning resources for ICOS?
 I've started to dig into more advanced (still rather simple compared to full-out enterprise but I'll get there eventually) networking, and there are a multitude of resources for the major players, as well as a pretty strong community for SONIC. What I cannot find, for the life of me, is more than the introductory "user manual" PDF for ICOS, which doesn't actually describe how to do much more than set VLANs and configure the management port.
 I recently came into possession of a whitebox switch with ICOS pre-installed, and I was hoping someone has had experience and/or resources before I just go caveman "play with it till I break it, then wipe and install SONIC" on it (apparently, at least as to the newest information I can find for my particular switch/ASIC, SONIC breaks break-out functionality for the QSFP+ ports, and while not 100% necessary since it's just one of several learning platforms, I would like to have that function).

 What do y'all call your datacenter equivalent of a hangar queen?

One thing I keep running in to though is that some servers will have a hostname of of 123.4.56.789.sea.datapacket.com but their AS comes back as Datacamp Limited. A quick glance at their respective websites sugests they are two entirely different entities. Or in some cases I get multiple ASNs back. Other companies I see this happening with are CDN77,DataCamp Limited, CDNext, and LogicWeb. Really struggling figuring who is who.

 Yesterday, I was suddenly unable to reach a particular website - can't ping it. I logged in to a virtual machine within 10miles of me and I can't get to the website there either. I checked "Down for Me" and it's not down. I checked a third PC, located 300 miles away, and I can get to the website.
 Here's where it gets weird. I check another PC in the same local network as the PC that can't reach the site, and I can get to the site!
 I ran tracert on the one that can reach it, and it looks like it's not going through the same DNSs.
 Can anyone shed some light on what's going on? I suspect some DNS gremlins - but it's out of my league.
 Should add - I own the website - and it's running perfectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most common things that I see on here are issues with IT Departments getting notified of personnel changes. New hires, terminations, title changes, department moves, etc. 
 Does your company have a real HRIS? Not some spreadsheet Karen put together, but a publicly purchasable platform? It probably has an API. It could even have web hooks. 
 Take the time, if you have the coding chops or someone in the company does, to set up a connection to that API and monitor employee changes. 
 Billy gets fired and the HRIS gets updated? Automatic email to the IT ticket system. Becky gets hired? Automatic email to the ticket system. Andy changes job titles? IT probably needs to change security groups, distribution groups, and update AD properties. Guess what. Automated email to the ticket system. Jenn stays in the same position but changes supervisors? You guessed it, email to the ticket system. Heather went on FMLA and needs a temporary revocation of access? Believe it or not, automatic email to the ticket system. 
 There are no more late notifications, as long as HR is on the ball. You are eliminating the weak link- humans remembering they need to tell IT. 
 Even if you can't do it in house, hire someone. Your ROI is huge. Customer service improves. Visibility improves. Metrics on time to delivery become meaningful. 
 HR doesn't have an HRIS? Well, that's probably the first thing the company needs.

No matter what position I'm in I seemingly can't escape this customer service mindset from management and its driving me insane. I don't care about their issues. I don't care about their whining. That's for helpdesk. I'm here to build infrastructure, improve security, and ensure five nines of uptime. I'm not putting on any sort of customer service persona. Put in a ticket to helpdesk, do not approach me personally.
 The kicker is that I'm actually a very nice person for an IT guy - I frequently go out with coworkers, go to almost all the company events, get coffee with users, etc, but the enforcement of customer service has gone so far to extend to my real personality. I hate it, I want to be nice and not view everyone as an annoyance but this mindset makes it impossible.
 Anyways, did I get into the wrong industry? If so, what's an industry where you don't have to deal with people, or listen to their whining? At this point I'm totally willing to change career paths so I can get my personality back.

 We have run into a problem lately where 3rd party contractors and vendors not using their own laptops / desktops cannot connect to our RDS Apps. When connecting to the app they get stuck on Configuring Remote Session and it sits cycling forever.
 None of our domain joined company devices are having this issue. Re-imaging a non-domain joined laptop that we use for testing also resolved the issue but obviously telling 3rd party users to wipe their machines isn't a viable solution.
 This appears to be a recent issue and the only recent change I can remember making to the environment is updating the certificates about a month ago. I double checked that certificate was applied to all of the Broker roles and in the Gateway manager as well as IIS.

Our client is a painful at times to work with, and our contract mgmt side is abysmal.

 I want to opt out of this without activating them.

 Anyone here know if there's a setting somewhere that amounts to "leave me alone for another week or so"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been avoiding helping friends and acquaintances with their IT related purchases simply because they always assume that if I've had anything to do with their purchase, I'm forever responsible for it and obligated to provide endless free support. 
 This is why the only thing I am still willing to recommend is a Chromebook and even that only if they're willing to pay Google for extra storage. 
 Surely, I can't be the only one. What's your way of wiggling out of this unwanted trojan-horse responsibility? How do you deal with friends asking you to help them buy/set-up/upgrade their network, computers, home automation, etc? Where and how do you set boundaries?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is just for future reference, since this has been a lengthy support case @ Microsoft. And there had been only 1 search result online which led nowhere.
 When trying to repair our CTR Office installs we were presented with an error code 30029-9 - supposedly Office has no internet connection stating "Online Repairs need the internet and it looks like you may not be connected."
 We finally pinned it down to a group policy that's Enabled but left blank. This used to work, and now somehow it doesn't anymore since. And apparently it's "By design".
 The group policy setting is 
 Target Version
 The field "Update Version" was blank. Which now triggers this error. And even though the Group Policy itself says "If you enable this policy setting, but you leave the version blank, Office is updated to the most current version that’s available at the update location for Office" it's no longer working and it's _by design_ that it's suddenly starting to spill this error.
 If we set the policy to "Not Configured" - everything is working fine.
 So the resolution to this; Not Configured. 🤷‍♂️

My understanding is that this only affects inbound messages and put fail dmarc auth into my domain user's spam folder. Or does it also affects outgoing email? So for example, if i set the DMARC rule to p=quarantine will this ever affects me as a sender that if the recipient does not have DMARC turned on it will put my email into their spam folder too?

 The plan is for a training environment for my team (SOC/IR) to work through scenario-based engagements with our in-house red team, but we need some "noise" for the red team to blend into. Ideally, something that will generate user activity in the form of opening applications, logging in and out, accessing sites, and email traffic - the things you would see daily on a live network. As it stands, without this, the moment the red team performs any action, it is immediately obvious as they are generating the only traffic.

 Of course I'm planning a downtime for the virtual servers. Also I want the virtual servers to run as they do now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I was in desktop support for a larger internal IT department for 3 years before this (total of 7 years including my first job there in helpdesk)
 Didn't touch intune/group policy/or another form of remote management previously. I was just on the but end of stick and kicked off images and did deskside support for workstations and hardware support for laptops.
 An opportunity came to me 6 months ago from my old boss who changed companies for a MSP and I became a "Systems Administrator" basically everything to do with remote workstation and application management with a bit of apple mdm in the mix also. Intune/group policy/PDQ/some PowerShell scripting/MDT/SCCM/remote application deployment and updates.
 This was everything I wanted to do in my last role but it went to the sysadmins to do and I had no access.
 When I started there was a senior guy who knew everything and was loads of help to escalate to. He has since resigned since a few weeks ago.
 So now me and the other new guy are on our own. The ticket queue keeps building up and there are dozens of tickets that neither of us have any idea how to fix. SLA's are ticking away and customers are expecting updates for ticketd that have been sitting in the same status for weeks
 Yes I'm getting my googling and actioning stuff, making mistakes and fixing things but everyday is completely miserable. I went from knowing everything at the back in of my hand to bieng a junior again
 Those that went from helpdesk/desktop support to a "sysadmin" position how did you cope/deal with the day to day workloads?
 Thanks

 We're currently about to deploy the M365 Apps for Enterprise (Office 365) to our endusers. For patching we use a 3rd Party Patch Management solution (Matrix42 PatchManagement) which manages the new office versions. The clients should therefore not use auto updates via CDN as the patches should all be installed via the 3rd-party solution. 
 To achieve this, we tried to disable the automatic updates using group policy and set the option "Enable Automatic Updates" to "Disabled". Enable Automatic Updates (admx.help) 
 At first launch when the policy is active the update seems to be disabled but as soon as I login with an Azure AD account in order to get office licensed the option is reset and updates are offered via CDN.
 Did anyone face a similar behavior already and knows if there is an additional option in the M365 tenant configuration which may overrules the GPO setting?
 Thanks in advance.

 Situation:
 PC1 has 2 network addresses configured (primary 192.168.1.10, secondary 192.168.20.201) and is connected to the Fortigate 30e.
 PC1 tries to communicate with another PC2 through Fortigate with address .20.201 -> .20.8
 Fortigate has only 192.168.1.99/24 lan address and firewall rules for the .1.0/24.
 Client says that connection works, but it is slow ( 50-100kB/s ) if you try to send something from .20.201 -> .20.8.
 Client also said that connection is fast when you remove Fortigate and just connect those PC's together. Also with some stupid switch the connection works fine.
 How can this even work because Fortigate don't have any .20.0/24 configurations? Do i need to add secondary IP or how should i configure that.
 Spoiler: I'm new to the networking field and this is my first job related to the networking configurations, so please don't kill me, if this is too simple question.

 I'm running into a few problems with my Synology, I have the latest dsm installed and have 5 disks configured in a raid 10 with 1 hot spare disk.
 This has been configured as a btrfs volume.
 I want to use the volume via iscsi on my windows Hyper-V server as a backup location.
 I have set up the iscsi target on my server and the drive shows up but as unknown and offline.
 So I'm struggling with getting the drive setup as a usable volume in windows.
 Does anyone have any tips or tricks i could try? I've been searching on the Synology knowledge base but can't find any relevant info.
 Cheers, Henk

My last position was a salaried IT support specialist, which came out to 25/hour (52k/year - yes, i believe I was overpaid there). This is a contract to hire position, and it was mentioned that if hired the salary would be around 70k, and from brief research in my state that's about right. I know I'm technically an employee of the contracting company, but am I being kinda shafted here? I'm not too hung up on this as the position looks great on my resume, but I am slightly annoyed by it, especially since I'm making less than I was in what many would consider a less in-demand position. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a little stumped trying to troubleshoot a site of mine. I’m an IT engineer, I like to think I’m not a complete n00b, I’ve successfully been in this field for 10 years I just neglected to learn some of the basics but do well at learning on the go. 
 This site has 1GB single mode dedicated fiber coming in to the MPOE. We are currently, and temporarily, using an office space with existing infrastructure. They got CAT5E running to this MDF, into my Meraki MX100, and then back out over CAT5E into a Meraki 24PoE switch (can’t recall which model at the moment but can confirm ports are 1Gb compatible) and then to 4 Meraki MR42s. We are a commercial construction company, this site hosts our team as well as our subcontractors which are mainly an architectural firm and a mechanical/electrical/plumbing — aka high usage on full days (250gb up and down). The device connections are spread evenly across the WAPs. Channel utilization is also spread well. Users connected to the WAPs max on speed tests at 72mb. On these busy days there could be 30-50 users. I’m trying to understand how there’s so much loss to the user. I haven’t been able to test directly myself, but the ISP Claims their circuit test results at full speeds. Tests from my router max at 750mb. Tests from the switch max close to that. Tests from the WAPs max at 200mb. Again the user even on a light user day gets 72 — but on busy days they experience soooo much latency and I’m just… lost. I cant see where or why. 
 Application usage in the dashboard shows normal activity, UDP or secure web, MS apps, AWS etc (lot of cloud storage, pretty much everything is SaaS). 
 But I do wonder if the CAT5E is an issue. 
 Can anyone provide some guidance on testing further or troubleshooting? Or validate my one and only theory? Thanks in advance and sorry for sounding like a network n00b. I promise I’m not a total beginner.

All Groups have domain: myTLD.onmicrosoft.com
 All Groups have start with "part_"
 All Users are in a dynamic Microsoft 365 group: "Block E-mail" with an e-mail address of blockemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com
  
Because the groups are always being added, I don't want to block it at the group level with delivery management options (unless this is the better/only way). I'm hoping a transport rule will work for this: 
 I created a transport rule "Block Messages to Teams Groups"
 If message
 Includes these words in the recipient's address 'part_' and and recipients's address domain portion belongs to any of these domains: 'myTLD.onmicrosoft.com' and Is received from a member of group 'blockemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com'
 Do the following
 Set audit severity level to 'Low' and reject the message and include the explanation 'E-mail to part Teams is not allowed.' with the status code: '5.7.1'
 The above rule isn't catching the messages. In message trace. [User1@TLD.com](mailto:User1@TLD.com) (internal message) hits the "[part_restofemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:part_something@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com)" e-mail address (a M365 Group), expands and then sends to all members of the group.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, looking for some gear suggestions for a proposed setup at my work because there’re too many options on the market for my small brain to handle. 
 Relatively remote mine site with no fixed connection available, have now got a Starlink online serving as the main connection with a 4G modem as a failover, the rest is basically a mess I’m looking to overhaul. 
 Things I know I need and their requirements below - switch - currently eyeballing a smart/managed device, needs to handle VLANing and possibly some PoE. Probably 10 medium usage devices so throughput likely not a factor, but open to suggestions of standalone routers etc - access points - all devices are currently running on wifi which works well enough for now, so looking for access points that can handle VLAN/multi-SSID (at least 4?), one of which will be located outside 
 Also open to any other suggestions for things to be added. Looking at adding local servers with VPN access and dedicated firewalls and all that jazz once I get a tech consultant out, but just trying to set up segregated/isolated network traffic for different businesses on site/QoS/stuff I understand now. 
 Thanks!

 Is this something normal that I don't know about?
 Any ideas of where in the linux networking stack this might occur?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been the industry for over ten years. Quickly moved in to infrastructure and worked for an MSP where I deployed firewalls, phone systems, switches and some servers. After that I had a short stint as a manager and got back in to infrastructure.
 I would assume my work at the MSP was/is very similar to what consultants do. At the MSP our sales guys would sell some equipment and I'd go in, figure out what they have, how to make it better (or more secure) and deploy the equipment. I assume consultants focus on the middle part, figuring out what you have and make suggestions for improvement. 
 I am by no means an expert but a "jack of all trades, master of none" type. Really, I know how to google stuff. I don't have certs. I learn enough about a system to get it to work how I need it to and then move on.
 I believe this would be mostly network related consulting. I don't have many details yet. 
 Anyways, I told him I was interested but not sure what to expect or even know what I should be paid or if there's anything I should do to protect myself. 
 Any advice would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current setup. 2 hosts and 1 nimble. 
 Each virtual machine on the two hosts have 1-2 virtual disks .
 Some of the non-os disks are inside-vm-iscsi connections to the nimble.
 each virtual disk has its own data store on the ESXi that is pointed to its own nimble volume
 the nimble has 28 volumes, one for each virtual disk/ iscsi-connection.
 Would it be sane to create 1 nimble volume on the nimble and 1 datastore per ESXi server, point both new ESXi servers to their own datastore, and create all VM disks inside ESXi in their own datastore?

We have had a SonicWall firewall for a few years and have been impressed by it so I unfortunately assumed the quality level of their switches would be the same. That was a horrible assumption and I'm looking to replace all 8 SonicWall switches now. But part of the reason we went with SonicWall instead of Dell or Cisco was because of availability issues. Does anyone know of a brand that has switches available for immediate or within a few weeks shipping that they could genuinely recommend.

 I've only physically connected to one of the switches so far but I've provisioned the second one in the cli of switch 1 and configured both sets of ports. I've also set the first switch to priority 15 to ensure it remains switch1 when I connect them.
 My question is, if I connect the stack now, with the second switch containing a factory default config (same firmware), will the provisioned switch 2 port configs get applied to the actual switch 2? Are there any other steps I need to take to ensure that happens?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently took over managing DNS and our cloud based WAF for my company. We have a websites hosted on a combination of several subdomains and root domains (e.g. my.company.com & company.com). Currently I'm trying to see if it's possible to route 100% of our traffic through our cloud based WAF before it reaches our firewall. 
 At one point I tried doing a permanent 301 forwarding of the root domain company.com to www.company.com, and then C-naming www.company.com to the edgekey which points to the site. This worked for HTTPS, but broke HTTP redirection causing the site to fail if you didn't specify HTTPS. 
 Next, I thought AWS might work if we moved our domains there because they allow ALIAS records for root/apex domains, but after closer inspection it seems limited to only pointing to something else hosted at AWS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html
 After a bit of a learning process, it's looking like the only real option to route ALL traffic through our WAF is to pay them to host our subdomains/root domains for us. This isn't cheap. Since I've only been dealing with public DNS & WAFs for a few months , I thought I'd ask and see if anyone knew of an alternative?

Our Exchange admin ran a powershell script and said she has ~19,500 folders, I ran a Vbs macro (I don’t have access to Exchange powershell) and it said she had 29,000 folders.
 Do I have to sift through 20,000 sub folders within nested sub folders to clean this up? I’m not knowledgeable about Exchange PS at all but I’d assume the exchange admin would have offered some solution if there was one.
 This all came about when trying to replace her computer, some of her sub folders weren’t appearing. The exchange admins were suggesting basic things like restarting or reloading her profile- I found a Microsoft article saying cached versions of outlook run into issues when a user has 500 folders so I asked the exchange admins if they could tell on their how many she had (before I found the macro) and lo and behold they said that was likely the issue

 Also our VoIP (Mitel) phones are not getting Voicemails or Directory services (calls work internally and externally).
 Office 2 has a VoIP switch (ShoreTel/Mitel).
 Wondering if the IPSEC tunnel is missing some configuration? Or there could be some configuration I am missing on the Layer 3 switch?
 The new Office 2 location also has Aruba switches in place. Will add more details if there are more questions.

 I have recently deployed a branch of my company with 100% of meraki switch (ms120/410)) with all the network protection "on" :
 - Stormcontrol (broadcast/unknown unicast/multicast) 80%
 - RSTP (core 4096 / others 8192 )
 - IGMP snooping / Flood unknown multicast traffic "enable"
 Everythings works fine except for the deployment of Windows client with SCCM Server (F12) on all my VLAN. Some client are in the same VLAN than the SCCM server DP, some not so my Paloalto'FW (connected to the core) is making ip helper relay for all VLANs.
 DHCP server are on a datacenter, outside the lan, so i put the mac address of the FW has the only DHCP server allowed on my Meraki network profil. DHCP standard request works fine like that.
 Another branch is full meraki too but with no protection and F12 works fine so i suppose that is somethings on my meraki configuration...
 Any ideas ?

Individually, each of the units works properly. However when all LAN/WAN links are enabled on both appliances, they appear to both try to go active which causes a big headache. 
 Each unit can communicate via heartbeat, until failover is attempted, and then they stop being able to hear each other’s heartbeat packets until they are rebooted. Unit failover is confirmed to be configured properly by Fatpipe support (it’s the identical config that was working on our old units).
 FatPipes documentation is.. mediocre, and their support has been unable to resolve the issue. Just wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar with their Warp appliances? Grasping at straws here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi There,
 I am looking to add a second Nexus 5k to my environment with a vPC configuration with the existing 5k. Currently, my UCS environment has both FI A and FI B plugged into the single Nexus 5k.
 Are there any specific changes I need to be considerate of in UCS when plugging FI-B into the second 5k?
 Right now, the config on the single 5k is:
 interface Ethernet1/10 description link to FI A switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 69 interface Ethernet1/11 description link to FI B switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 69 
 I am not sure yet why the second ports from each FI were never configured. Maybe licensing?
 I raised a request with Cisco support, and they pointed me to a document regarding disjointed networks, which I'm not sure applies to this scenario.
 Please let me know if I can provide additional detail.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys, I’m stuck scratching my head on this one but I figured someone might have a good idea here.
 Recently I discovered some odd access switch behavior, the following config and results occurs; Layer 2 switch downstream from layer3 is adding routes to the routing table that are not accurate and are causing asymmetric traffic.
 Layer 2 switch, cisco catalyst, is configured with only a default gateway of the core, ip routing is not enabled and no static routes defined.
 When we pull up routes on the layer 2, there are specific hosts getting routed to the next hop after the core switch, often times this route is pointing to the default route that is configured on the core.
 I have never seen an access switch add host entires into a routing table before, I thought this could have been an issue with CEF but that doesn’t seem to be the case.
 We also thought it might have been a route redistribution issue, but we’ve now ruled that out as testing from a different remote subnet only experiences a few access switches following this behavior.
 I’ve been toying with the idea that this might be proxy arp, but the fact that it’s not every device has me on the fence.
 Any advice or suggestions are most welcome.

Luckily it was just a switch that needed power cycling, but if it was an SFP issue I don’t have a way to test them and I have no need to be carrying SFP with me for spares since this is the first time I came across an issue recently. Is there a usb to SFP adapter that I can throw any SFP into? Bonus if they support 10g fiber.

 We are setting up a new property with all the structured cabling being CAT6A
 I have a couple of questions
  
We will have 10G capable switches. We will also have cable runs that will be as long as 80m.If the patch cord in the cabinet (patch panel <-> switch) is a 3m cat6 cable, will we be able to get 10G across the cable run?
 Some switches will have PoE+ devices. Our cable vendor suggested that we if we use 30AWG CAT6A cable for the patching (patch panel <-> switch), we will only be able to bundle together 12 cables because of the heat dissipation. Have you ever run across this issue?
  
I would love to hear your thoughts

 Installing this while storage is set to RAID in BIOS generates a BSOD with Inaccessible_Boot_Device message. AHCI works fine (But with 7420 i have often seen AHCI been reset to RAID for unknown reasons and this has generated many support cases, so i prefer to use the default RAID option).
 ​
 Solution: I rolled back to the previous driver package we used (A08). A09 is not tested, but if you have used A09 and it worked, it should be safe rolling back to that.
 ​
 Hopefully this will reduce time spent om troubleshooting for some of you :)

 I need to configure all of our endpoints to automatically connect to networks on the Public profile (not Private/Home) and am unsure of the best way to go about it. Is there an easy way to block through Intune or another method that I can deploy to the endpoints?
 One issue I find is that many devices have already connected to these networks and it would be nice to configure them differently instead of dealing with 100 blocks and network issue tickets the moment that would be enabled. One solution I thought of was to deploy a script that flipped all the networks to Public through the DWORD in the registry under all previously connected networks.
 This feels like a dumb question, so anything is helpful but let me know if I am being dumb and there is a better way to handle this (such as configuring the way private networks are handled)...

 Edit: for more context, I'm at a startup that's scaling quite quickly, so this has been an ongoing issue. Especially because we're based in the Netherlands and these new employees are mostly working remote. So I need to first get them delivered to the office, then set them up (MDM, etc), then dispatch to the employees wherever they are. We have a relationship with just one supplier, so always encouraged to go through them. However, seems like this won't be scalable. Good idea to have buffer stock so will use this thread for the next conversation. Also looking into more scalable solutions/platforms that streamline this whole thing. 
 Thank you for all the advice. Pray for me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 ​
 Im trying to add a log-prefix to a message before its send to a syslog server. But something not working the way i thought it would.
 ​
 I read from a log file:
 source s_esxihostd {
 file("/data/logs/hostd.log" follow-freq(1) program_override("esxi070: ") flags(no-parse));
 };
 ​
 Destination to send:
 destination d_network {
 syslog("x.x.x.x" transport("tcp") port(514));
 };
 ​
 Logfile is being sent:
 log {
 source(s_esxihostd);destination(d_network);
 };
 ​
 The message is sent to the syslog server - but the "prefix" (esxi070) arent printed before the logmessage. I would have expected on the syslog server: "esxi070: <log string>"
 Am i doing it wrong? Or is there another way to add a prefix in syslog-ng, for what i can tell it should be the program-override() because the log-prefix() it deprecated?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This one has us perplexed. 
 Customer had a SBS 2011 server running QB DB manager for their enterprise QB. We upgraded to server 2019 standard, installed QB DB Manager as we would normally. Soon as we did almost every day they tell us they can't switch to Multi-user mode. We can't find anything wrong, no errors reported by DB Manager, service is always running. We simply login, tell it to scan, accept the warning and it starts working. Maybe for a day, maybe for a few hours, maybe for a week. 
 They can all get to the files just fine from the file share. When they choose multi user mode it doesn't work until we click the scan button again. We have several servers with DB manager installed but this one is the only one giving us a problem. Quickbooks support has no clue what's wrong. 
 The only oddity that occurred, while we were running the both the SBS 2011 and the 2019 standard some users had issues getting to file shares, as in the connection just seemed very slow. All local lan GB switched. As soon as we cut over the 2019 to be DC and GC with all roles, that issue disappeared. The only issue they still have is resetting the DB manager constantly to allow multi user mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a bit of a background: On September 14th, bleepingcomputer.com published an article of a security vulnerability in the desktop client of MS Teams. They recommended, that users should switch to the browser version of MS Teams, until a patch is available. I made all my users use the browser client after reading this article.
 Now I accidently found an article by Tony Redmond, in which he argues, that the vulnerability is not easily exploitable in the real world. He recommends not to switch to the browser version, and still use the desktop version of MS Teams.
 Microsoft itself doesn't think, that the vulnerability is critical, and has no priority of fixing the bug.
 So, did I overreact, when I advised my users to use the browser client? (They are nagging each week, that they would rather use the desktop client.)
 And how do you decide in general, if a security vulnerability is worth the effort?
 Edit: Made the argument clearer

 So my initial thought was to do this in PowerShell combined with Intune. But the Intune part seems a little bit too limited for my liking. Or I am not bright enough to solve this puzzle.
 So in terms to understand this behavior, it is when a user connects an USB device with a specific ID, it will install the software/driver for the device.
 I have found the device ID of the device, and setup a detection for it, tested it with multiple different devices and it is the same for this device on every single PC that I have tested with.
 Then I will try and check if the software is already installed on the client PC, and if it is, then do nothing. If it is not, then proceed to install the so…]]></summary>

 What else I can try? Does it make sense to set 'Disabled" on Turn On Virtualization based Security, if it was set to Not Configured by defaults?

 I'd like to put some numbers to this to see if it's actually beneficial. I've done a quick bit of math and found that we would have to print out 130,000 pages to cost roughly the same as the iPad (about 4 years worth of this job). 
 Is there a way to factor in the environmental cost of the iPad? I'm guessing that all the silicon, glass, gold, zinc etc. are harder to recycle than standard paper, but it would be nice to have a way of quantifying this. 
 Is there any way I can work this out more scientifically than guesswork?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Yesterday, I had a problem with firmware upgrade with C9300 and thanks to you, it is solved.
 Now, I have a another problem.
 I configured two 9200 switch as stack switch. After speaking with my colleague, we said that is better that we unstack the switches instead. The problem is that I now can not access the switches after configuring TACACS. I only configured tacacs (they are not installed in the network yet) but I did not configure line con 0 (which Im using for accessing the switches). It just ask me about a username for whatever reason and I can not grasp why.
 Anyway, I would like to factory-reset both the switches from rommon mode. The problem is that, I do not find the correct command to do it.
 Here is all the command in rommon mode for C9200:
 switch: ?
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 arp Dump or Clear ARP Table
 boot Load and boot an executable image
 cat Display text content from a file
 copy Copy a file
 dir List filesystems or a directory on a filesystem path
 help List command information
 history Show command history
 idprom Show idprom data
 ping Ping use ICMP protocol to get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from host
 ping6 Ping use ICMP protocol to get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from host
 reset Reset entire system
 set Set an environment variable value
 unset Unsets an environment variable
 version Show sboot version and runtime info
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 ​
 I used the "reset" command but there is no difference. Not sure what the reset command really do but it does not do a factory-reset which I want.
 Would appreciate any help or any guide you know of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a two customers experiencing the same issue and everything has led me to think it’s their network - probably because the way they’re putting together two ISP connections.
 I don’t know how it’s bonded though. It could be through a failover or load balanced. I don’t know. Anyhow, when I set SMTP settings into a MFP, only one email service provider works.
 Not Yahoo, not Gmail, not even the ISPs own email servers establish a connection. They all get timed out. There’s one email service provider that does work but the customers aren’t allowed to use that one because they aren’t paying for it.
 I increased the connection time. Tried multiple DNS. I’ve gone through the whole app passwords thing. I’ve gone through each port. I’ve tested through telnet with success. I also logged in each web portal site and can indeed send emails. I can even connect the MFP to a mobile network and send emails with any of those SMTP settings with no problem. Just not through their network except for that one email service provider. 
 Everything that makes sending emails through an MFP work should work, but doesn’t and it’s only happened with these two customers with their bonded network connections. What I think is happening is that the 250 OK isn’t coming back, so the MFP just gives up. 
 What can I ask them to look for when I visit them again? Should I ask to plug in and tracert, telnet, etc. from within? I get scared plugging into another’s network.
 I can’t ask if the prefix or suffix is being blocked, nor can I ask if the port is being blocked because that one email service provider works. It’s just all other ones don’t. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
 Sorry for the inconvenience.

 Hope you all are doing well and safe.
 I have been assigned to replace the old cisco 3750 and 2960 switches with cisco 9200L series. 
 I have restored the cisco switches which are on the same model, but in this case the models are different. So, I am assuming that this might not be possible as there are differences in hardware and possbily OS version as well.
 What's the best way for the above situation? The old switches are still in production.
 Many thanks :)

 I'm an aspiring sysadmin and still need a lot to learn. That's why I'm making this thread. To collect knowledge from people that are smarter than me.
 Surely some of you have gotten to a point, at which you struggled to solve a certain problem. I noticed, that I often find myself in such scenarios, with no idea on how to address the issue.
 Are there a single or more processes a sysadmin can go through, to solve problems? I am willing and eager to learn, but I cant seem to find the thing I'm looking for. I know that there is no single way to solve all problems, but surely there has to be some kind of approach, to determine what the issue is, right? 
 I'll define what I would call a "process" using a problem, I've got to solve at the moment. 
 I've got VoIP PBX that works like it should, with one exception: the FAX service.
 Since the PBX doesnt send faxes like the old way, it receives an incoming fax , converts the content into a mail and sends the mail to the recipient. This stopped working a few days ago. 
 After a little search, I noticed that the mail server doesnt work anymore. The testmail results in an error message. So I changed it to a Google SMTP to check if the function still works, which it does. The testmail is send successfully, but someone never arrives. 
 Is there a way to check why my testmail does not arrive, and if yes, how?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

My plan is to walk her through how the simulations will work and what she'll need to do, so I'm hoping for a tool that has a phish reporting mechanism (maybe forwarding an email to specific email address?) and is of low cost (or preferably free!)
 Does anyone know of any such offerings? Or maybe a bigger security company like Knowbe4 has a personal/family plan?

 WSUS was passed over for Intune, but Intune wasn't deployed when it was supposed to be. Therefore, as a stopgap, I'm being asked to use GPO to force feature updates.
 Many of our devices are stuck at 21h1 which was the version built into the image. Devices refuse to update to 21h2. The update doesn't even show when checking for updates. However, downloading and running the installer tool allows it to install without issue.
 Has anyone seen this before? I ran the troubleshooter and it can't figure it out either.
 I wrote the GPO to force-check updates and update to at least 21h2 with business hours excluded and different settings for mandatory restarts etc.
 If this fails, aside from going machine to machine, I'm at a loss...

I am not a networking guy; I knew that it would not be as easy as plugging the switch in an it would work immediately - but I also didn't realize that I needed to build an operating system to make it work At the moment I have a $10,000 door stop; I have cloned the onie repo and attempted to build for Mellanox and then I started working through issues (this library isn't installed, that tool isn't installed..) for about 1.5 hours before reaching an error indicating that I should not be a root user, but then nothing works unless I am root so...?? In looking through the onie repo the SN2100 isn't even listed as supported hardware and it hasn't been updated for 5-8 years. 
 Is there an image on the switch that works somewhere, or is this something that everyone has to deal with? How do I get an OS that is made for the switch and works properly?
 It seems crazy to me that a company would sell a product that is so expensive and then just have a pointer to an open source project and not even say "good luck, have fun! lol". :(

 As stated - quick and dirty is okay here - I just want to connect to a live ethernet line and force the port it connects to to blink at a consistent rate. I have used tool that do this in the past, but was hoping something could be done with bash or PowerShell.

 Thank you in advanced for any help you may provide!

 edit: to clarify, one of this reason I am not using switching functions is because the hardware may all be unmanaged, and if it is managed - I will not have the credentials. Additionally, I know one goal is to identify why some APs are offline - if the cable is live but PoE is not being provided, I want to be able to find the other end of the cable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I am reviewing the power loss prevention strategy at a client site due to a severe power outage we had over the weekend that caused issues and the UPS did not pick up the slack quickly enough. I am reviewing the UPS situation so this question is solely looking at the R220 server.
 The server we have is an R220 with the H310 raid controller and Write Through enabled.
 Since Write Through is enabled there should be minimal loss (if any) during a power outage. Is there any advantage (other than performance) for upgrading the H310 to an H710P with a battery? Or does the advantage only come into play when Write Back is turned on?
 TLDR: If I have write through turned on with an H310, does upgrading to an H710P with a battery (with write through remaining on, NOT write back), do we gain any additional power loss protection?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 I'm a bit stuck on this one and any assistance would be amazing. I'm very much an Nginx noob.
 We have an existing Nginx setup with lots of redirections already configured.
 I'm trying to only redirect one subdomain in Nginx to an external url, however no matter what I try it redirects all subdomains. 
 I've reviewed our existing configs to get some understanding of how things are setup but the life of me I just can't work this one out and all the search results I seem to find are for redirecting all subdomains or sub sites not for redirecting just one subdomain of many.
 This subdomain didn't have an existing config and I've had to create one (copy one of our others and edit it) it looks like previously the subdomain was configured under a catch all.
 Example:
 I need https://foo-bar.test.com.au to redirect to https://externalURL.com
 However I don't want https://other-site.test.com.au to redirect to https://externalURL.com
 This is the current config
 ******************************************************************
 server {
 server_name foo-bar.test.com.au;
 rewrite ^ https://externalURL.com;
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 }
 ​
 server {
 listen 443 ssl http2;
 server_name foo-bar.test.com.au;
 rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://externalURL;
 ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/foo-bar.crt;
 ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/foo-bar.key;
 ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
 ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
 ssl_session_timeout 30m;
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 ​
 location / {
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 index index.html foo-bar.html;
 autoindex on;
 }

 For the purpose of the network, the AirFibre is like having an Ethernet cable between the two locations.
 Each of the two locations will have - Router - Switch - Separate and dedicated ISP internet connection
 Between these two locations, I would like to: - Access network resources that exist on either network - Use the other internet service as a backup
 My questions: 
  
How could I interconnect this? 
 What rules would I need to use?
  
Would: - “wireless cable 1” connect from network switch and LAN from office A to office B router - “wireless cable 2” from from network switch and LAN of office B to the office A router - setup a static route for the other office LAN on each office router to pass through the wireless link and to the other router - have a rule that passes WAN traffic normally through the local ISP, and through the wireless link interface if the ISP is down

 We have replaced the keyboard, mouse, and then the entire computer. The new PC was a clean image on a brand new computer taken out of the box for this. 
 The shift lock affects local physical users and remote control users over ConnectWiseControl. 
 At this point, I figure it has to be either some device plugged in that is screwing with the keyboard (this controls special hardware), or a bug in some piece of software needed on this computer. 
 We do not see this with otherwise identical computers and configurations around the org.
 We're going to try disconnecting all USB devices except for mouse and keyboard and see if it goes away, and do the old add them back one by one. But I had the idea that if there was something like Wireshark for USB, especially keyboard commands, it might narrow this down vs just blindly plugging things in.

Users will get kicked off of their internet connection intermittently. This mostly occurs during video calls, especially if there are multiple people on the same call.
 Network setup: WAN: Verizon FIOS 1GB Router: TP-LINK ER7206 Switch: Netgear Prosafe: GS724TPv2 AP: Ubiquiti UniFi U6-LR-US
 This issue started about 6 months ago. The router I had then was a Cisco router and Aruba AP. I swapped both those out and have the configuration above.
 Was hoping someone had some ideas where to go next? Thanks

 I'm at the office and decide to check my gmail and see that my NAS at home has been disconnected from the internet since midday. I figure our home internet has dropped out or there's been a power cut so decide to try and connect to the NAS over the internet anyway.
 Oh. It's up. That's weird. Why is it saying it's disconnected from the Internet then? Ah well, let's login and see what's going on. Enter credentials, enter the MFA code and "The verification code is incorrect"
 Um. WTF? Try a couple more times and MFA simply isn't working. There's no other admin account to login to (default admin account is disabled - I'm not a total idiot. Yes, yes I know, exposing NAS to the internet etc etc).
 I get my son, who's at home, to reboot the NAS hoping it's a temporary blip. Nope. Still cannot login as the MFA code isn't working.
 At this point my imagination is running wild and I'm assuming that it's been hacked and the MFA for my admin account has been reset to the hacker's phone. Other normal user accounts (non-MFA) are working. The data is still there, no encrypted files or anything else untoward seems to be going on. So, what the hell? 
 I check Synology forums and see posts about the time sync possibly being off but that isn't the case. I'm on the verge of asking my son to press the dreaded Reset button when I have a thought. I have a Active Directory domain at home and a single Zetec mini-PC box acting as DC. This also provides DNS for the home network. It couldn't be that could it? Why would that affect MFA on the NAS? 
 I get my son to check if the Zetec box is on. It wasn't. Soon as that was powered up and the DNS services started, MFA started working again. 
 Bloody DNS man....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a temporary setup for allowing multiple network clients to access a shared VPN resource. I have a Windows PC connected to the internet and sharing it's VPN connection to a switch over ethernet and it's working very well for all connected devices. I've used this setup before and it's easy with everything else I have running. Right now, it's all wired. 
 My question is: if that were to be shared on open wifi instead of ethernet, what dangers to the host/"main" network would there be?
 I know that if I were using a normal router for this, I'd be concerned they would navigate to 192.168.1.1, enter a correct password or bypass an insecure login page, and wreak havok. So I would know that I need a secure router and a good password or I could put management on another VLAN. 
 I'm aware of possible concerns about peer security. Client isolation will be enabled in the access point to this network. 
 What concerns are there with Windows ICS "acting as the router"? Can clients configure ICS settings or somehow reach the Windows PC's primary LAN? Would they be able to send commands to the Windows PC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently we are using a virtual data room solution that costs $6,000 for 2GB of storage and an additional $2000 per GB, so I am up to $8k annually. That seems really insane to me, and we are likely going to need to increase it to 4GB totaling 10K annually.
 I looked at other cloud storage solution providers, and for example, Box.com's Enterprise plan will allow me to only need to license internal users and all external users are free.
 With that, I could seemingly achieve the same thing for $2500 (5-6 internal users) instead of $8000. Not only that, but it includes unlimited storage as well which is a HUGE selling point to me.
 My use of our current data room solution solely exists to provide company financial files to investors. All that I need is activity audit logging, MFA, and granular permissions. It's used maybe once a year for a month or so during investor rounds, which makes the price tag even more painful.
 While we have SharePoint, I keep SharePoint use to internal only because its confusing to people, permission management is a PITA with external users, and audit reporting is no easy feat. I also want that clear delineation to employees to understand internal and external. I am just saying this so that I am not asked why I don't just use SharePoint for this.
 Is there something missing that I don't understand between the definition of a "data room" and just normal cloud storage setup to share with external/guest users?
 If you go look at Citrix ShareFile, theres specifically a data room tier that drops you from unlimited storage to 5GB of storage, and costs $448 a MONTH. Why is that a thing??
 Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: Based on the comments explaining the differences, it seems like we may be using a data room when we don't really need one for our specific purposes. I'll evaluate the other options. Thank you for the clarification!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings folks, 
 I just wanted to ask your feedback on this situation:
 I've been hired as a network engineer at a mid sized hospital organization, that also is looking for sysadmins.
 In the meantime, after working on network related tasks for about 8 months, I've been asked to assist with server security remediation. It's been understood that it's not a typical job role, but the whole IS team has been chipping in here and there and I certainly don't mind it given that its not all that much work.
 However, some of the maintenance cycles are scheduled for 10pm, on two Saturdays, and at 4am on the following two Sundays. 
 My question is, what server can possibly need to be updated at 4 in the morning? What's wrong with running both cycles simultaneously at 8pm during weekdays?
 Has anyone encountered this and can give any insight?
 Thanks!

 Someone said just use the phone hotspot.

I can ingress the domain and use any W10/W11 21H2 machine with no issues, and can ingress (using domain credentials) onto the domain with the 22H2 machine, but when I try to login with ANY domain user, it says the password is incorrect.
 I've set the minimum SMB version as SMB2 on Zentyal, but it didn't fix the issue.
 I'm not sure what can I do to investigate the issue further, as I don't receive eny error code.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how to track the cause of the issue? 
 Edit: Seems it's related to this bug 15197 – Windows 11 22H2 and Samba-AD 4.15 Kerberos login issue with the solution being setting up a separate samba server for 22H2 machines, or not updating to 22h2 until the next Zentyal version releases. Fuck me

 a certain user experiences problems whenever he logs into the terminal server and does a query which produces a huge amount of rows. The query just crashes his whole desktop and file system. No files can be created and no paths found. Trying to close any program gives an error message that states the path of the program could not be found. 
 I also can't access his virtual hard drive as the path can't be found. The only solution is to log him out with task manager and relog into the server. 
 Is it possible that this could have something to do with too little memory on our volume? There are only a couple of MB left and this is the volume where all our virtual hard disks are stored.

 Our Org is planing to move direction cloud and implementing the usage of Microsoft 365 Services.
 One Point to calculate is backup. I am trying to find a good solution that is price effective. Actually i'm looking at some solutions like avepoint, Veeam, you name it ... there are dozens of BaaS (Backup as a Service) solutions out there. In a nutshell all works similar you pay per user and Month - and i don't like it this way. Call me Old bastard if you want :) 
 Later i stumbled across Synology "Active Backup for Microsoft 365". An app running on your local NAS (synology ones obviously). If i understood right, there is no additional licencing beside of "owning a compatible NAS". We have allready some of this maschines running without any trouble/issues for year as Cheap local Backup Storage Targets. 
 For me, there are two main important things. 1) Price and 2) Stability of the product. And i like to have backups "on-prem" the "classic" way (3 times and different places). 
 Now im wondering if i find here some "real life" Opinions about this setup? Any good for an organisation with 150 Users? 
 Thanx!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use a Windows 2016 server to run print jobs for our ERP system. All printing is direct - no print servers/sharing involved.
 For the past year, it seems like about 50% of Microsoft's updates breaks our printers. The exact scenario is: post-update, about 90% of the printers will have been defaulted to duplex printing, and about 90% of the printers will be using the generic Microsoft printer driver. (Note that these two groups do not always overlap; sometimes a printer will still have the correct driver, but will have been changed to duplex printing, or vice-versa.) This is not printer or driver specific; it occurs across several different makes/models and drivers.
 Fixing it is a relatively simple, but frustrating process: Just go into each printer's "Advanced > Printing Defaults..." and disable duplex. Afterwards, both issues will be resolved.
 We attempted to resolve this with a simple bit of Powershell, set to run (as admin) on system startup:
  $printers = Get-Printer foreach($printer in $printers){ Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode 'OneSided' } 
 However, Set-PrinterConfiguration only works after the printer has been manually fixed. Otherwise, it generates the following error:
  Set-PrintConfiguration : Could not access configuration information for the specified printer. At C:\Scripts\Set_SingleSidedPrinting.ps1:7 char:5 + Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (MSFT_PrinterConfiguration:ROOT/StandardCi...erConfiguration) [Set-PrintConfiguration], CimException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80070002,Set-PrintConfiguration 
 Very frustrating. Any ideas how to resolve things? Either so that Windows Updates no longer cause the printing issue, or so that our script can reliably run, post-update?

Pasting the Password without a sudo prompt or such shows the correct text, but when asked for a password by ansible or sudo, only typing does it. No idea why. It has also been laggy when connected to Servers with a less than ideal connection. Not sure why my Input depends on the connection to the customer?
 So, suffice to say, i'm not happy with windows Terminal. Alacritty does everything great, except it doesn't have tabs.
 Putty also doesn't have tabs plus it's session management is... less than ideal.
 So, what do i do? My requirements are pretty basic. All Windows stuff can be done through PS. So all i really need is something that can do SSH, Tabs, maybe split windows. Stored sessions are a nice to have, but i'm fine copy pasting IPs and using my SSH config. Right Click Paste would be nice, but Ctrl+V works too. It should use Windows' build in OpenSSH, not putty and Pageant. Other than that, it should be responsive and work as expectet 100% of the time.
 What do those of you that Use SSH for admin tasks all day, but also need to use Windows, use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use to be a real go-getter. I'd be up at 7:00 am, I'd be scripting, I'd be documenting, I'd be on calls helping out people, I'd be helping teammates even if they didn't ask for it, I'd volunteer for tasks, I'd be working late or on the weekends trying to get something done or working the way I wanted it.
 Now? Fuck all that.
 I did that for years, and I'd see people getting promoted and then try to figure out what I did wrong. Or at the end of the year my review comes back with all 'meets', and just get the standard raise. At my third job, it hit me like a baseball in the nuts with a simple comment from another co-worker. 
 "Why, the boss didn't tell me to do it"
 It's that simple. All your manager is interested in is that you getting done what he or she assigned to you. Spending 12 hours making sure that documentation is just right might get you a "good job" comment from the manager and might get you the recognization of being a good document writer but you know what a quick bullet list you did in 20 minutes will tick that task complete and that is what your manager is interested in
 After I got that concept through my head my life in IT became a cakewalk and more important my salary has tripled over the past 10 years (and pretty much no overtime). 
 That's not to say I don't do anything extra. I spend a fair amount of time studying but I take a two-pronged approach. First, learn what is needed for the current job, the processes, the tech stack, the DBs etc. That is usually a month or two then, as I like to change jobs or get promoted every 2 or max 3 years I start studying for the job I want next. 
 I no longer waste my time trying to be the go-getter, the superstar, or that person everyone goes to for the answers cause at the end of the day it's just a job and I'm going to get paid the same to write an amazing doc or a bulleted list.
 Also, remember the rule of 5. How will it affect you in 5 minutes, 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years?

 During the day, no issues at all, even at peak times like 12 PM or the evening.
 Since this is affecting presumably the entire state, I doubt anything will change to fix it.
 My question though is... why? An ISP phone technician will be unlikely to tell me, so I'm just curious if there would be any likely cause for these issues? Are they doing updates to their routers that just randomly knocks everyone off the Internet deep at night?
 I'm also curious if anyone else has had experiences like this themselves?

 One lady with poor vision almost crying when I took a screen magnifier to her and set it up, who just stared at it going "wow" over and over with a huge smile.
 The kids with learning disabilities who got touch screen iMacs which blew their mind and who wrote a theme some (based on Batman) which they sang anytime they saw me.
 The doctor who actually got down on his knees and kissed my feet (I was with a colleague at the time) after I fixed his long-problematic monitor issues (it was literally 5 mins to download/reinstall an Nvidia driver). He said he'd had over a dozen calls and six IT staff at his computer by this point.
 I'm going to be honest I'm easily pleased but when you do make a difference and see that impact on someone else it reminds some of us why we chose to work in support.

 Head Office (HO): Sophos XGS Firewall (For troubleshooting all security between the two offices is temporarily disabled)
 Branch Office (BO): Mikrotik 915G
 IPSEC configured between the sites.
 Printers at the branch office are connected via the VPN to the windows terminal server located in HO.
 BO staff connect to HO Terminal server and print documents from their application to their local printers. Printing is taking about 1 minute per page 200kb(according to the spooler) to print. The connectivity appears stable and i dont see packet loss across the link and there is about 70ms between the two. I've performed packet captures from the BO Side and the HO Side. I was hoping to get some indication of where and if the fault is with the link. Also note, we have 3 other BO's connected to the HO with the exact same setup and no performance issues.
 After the initial handshake i see a large number of retransmissions from the HO Side with ACKs from the printer in the BO. This continues for about 15 seconds before a number of back and forwards of packets . After this, 10 seconds of what appears to be healthy communication occurs. I get a TCP Window full from the HO server to the BO Printer. The as well the ad the retransmissions and dup ACK returning. It continues this way for the next 20 seconds before a another flood of what appears to be healthy PSH/ACK communication. Finally ending in the FIN/ACK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Just a stupid question.
 I have multiple VMs running in an isolated network and want them to isolate, but I'd like to access them through the VPN connection. So as a solution I'm going to use one VM with the public IP, set up a firewall, and OpenVPN server. Also, I'm going to add authentication for the OpenVPN through the OpenLDAP server and redirect all routing for the VMs from the isolated network using this primary VM. So this primary VM will work as a router.
 So what kind of OS should I use for it?
 For now, I have created an ansible playbook that set up everything required using Ubuntu Server LTS. But I've read that Ubuntu is OS for the users and it's better to use BSD family OSes like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, or even OPNsense for the network devices.

 We've been using the Windows Server CIS L1 benchmarks for a while, but are now looking to roll them out to some Citrix servers. On the surface nothing in the benchmark policies seem problematic for users, but I'm concerned that there may be additional User Rights Assignment type permissions required in the Citrix context.
 Has anyone used the CIS policies in a Citrix environment and can speak to any issues, or alterations they had to make to the policies to allow things to work properly?

 "With backup schedule set to Hourly, the default selection for start time is 8 AM, schedule is Every 4 hours, and duration is 24 Hours. Hourly backup has a minimum RPO of 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. You can set the backup schedule to 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours respectively."
 Recovery point objective (RPO): The amount of acceptable data loss if a recovery needs to be done
 Azure support hourly VM backup, however their RPO indicates that the schedule is a minimum of every 4 hours.
 So is a backup performed every 1 or 4 hours? Or are they saying that even through you've set to hourly we will only guarantee a backup every 4 hours? If so than that's somewhat poor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We live in Canada and the last couple of Winters we have been getting more and more power losses due to storms. We average about 10-15 over the Fall/Winter season, and they often last for several hours.
 I recently identified an issue with a UPS we have (Cyberpower) where it does not take over immediately upon power loss, so the last few winters when I thought it was taking over, our Dell PowerEdge R220 server has been shutting off (not gracefully) every power outage.
 I am working on getting a good UPS in place with network SNMP traps that is more reliable -- thinking Tripp Lite as I have had good luck with them in the past. Let me know if there is anything specific I should be looking for when it comes to UPS purchases for a small server rack for a local business with a server, NAS, modem, and a couple other small devices.
 I was thinking something along the lines of https://www.cdw.ca/product/tripp-lite-1000va-ups-smart-avr-w-installed-webcardlx-1urm/3826234?pfm=srh
 For the server itself... we currently have WD GOLD 3.5" Enterprise HDD in there. Would there be any advantage to power loss data prevention by switching to the WD GOLD SSD with the power loss prevention feature? I have been looking for an excuse to move them over to SSDs, but only if it is a good safe guard against power loss. I know standard SSDs are not good for power loss protection, but are SSDs with power loss protection any better than the WD GOLD Enterprise HDDs I mentioned?
 The server we have also has an H310 raid controller and I was wondering if switching to H710p would offer any advantages to maintaining data integrity during a power outage? I understand the performance and IOPS difference between the two but not sure if one is better than the other for handling power loss.
 There's lots more info I could provide but just doing a quick write up for now.

 I work for a mid size documentary company in NYC. For the last two years our data closet has sat gathering dust, and I got fed up with a perfectly good 80TB of shared storage sitting unused. So I took a photo of all the various serial numbers, brute-forced the passwords (they were all the defaults - go figure), and bought the company’s first PC to see what I could do.
 Here’s a list of the equipment on our rack from top to bottom: - D-Link DGS-1210-16 (not connected to anything) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “LAN”) with cat6 cables running to stations - HP1920-48G network switch (labeled “LAN S”) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “PHONE”, the phones and their breadboard-looking-box have been removed) - CISCO Catalyst switch (Labeled “PHONE S”) - NETGEAR ProSafe XS712T switch (with one fiber expansion port, connected via fiber to NAS, and Ethernet to LAN, second NAS) - 24-port RJ45 patch box with mix of Cat 5e, 6, and 6e ports that run to CAT7 cables to edit stations - Synology DS1618+ - Synology DS3617xs
 My goal is to get an office network up and running with the CAT7 lines running 10Gb to edit stations and Cat6 lines running 1Gb to producers stations. From there, I want to host a server for Signiant Media Shuttle that will allow my NAS both through my router’s firewall and to the office network. I presume this means it all has to go through either the 10Gb or 1Gb switch (or both?). My office has 1Gb fiber through Verizon, and we have their router.
 If anyone out there has any advice for me, or can point me to good resources, I would greatly appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I have a mostly WFH job in IT which requires the occasional local onsite visit. However, recently my company have mentioned they want to potentially send me to a large city that is roughly 6 hours away (flying or driving, all travel is expensed) for a week out of every month for a project that’s expected to last a year or longer. 
 Travel time are hours that go on the timesheet to make up my 40 hours for the week. A hotel and car will be provided. All work related expenses can be expensed if I provide a receipt. If driving my own car, I can expense the gas at .55c/km, which adds a nice small bump to my pay cheques.
 My main concern is that a quarter of my year will be spent away from home and family. I don’t have kids, only a girlfriend who would miss me being home but can deal with it. After a while, I don’t think I will really be able to enjoy my leisure time when the day is finished if I cannot go home to relax. 
 It would be a decent learning experience but it’s experience I could get locally as well. I make under $60k CAD (~45k USD) in Ontario.
 I enjoy my job but feel they are asking a bit much of me. My boss implied that travel is part of the job but I feel that there needs to be additional monetary compensation.
 Do any of you guys receive compensation for this type of extended travel for long projects? What do you think should I be asking for? Is it just part of the job? 
 Thanks in advance for any input.

A lot of what I do is troubleshooting and proving the network is not the cause of X issue. It would be nice to not have to answer to end users and just focus on building stuff.
 Has anyone else felt this way? Maybe this is just a grass is always greener situation. I'm in my mid-30's and feel like I'm too old to transition to SE.

We haven't made any changes at the firewall and I have opened it wide just for testing still no luck. Have tried switching our public IP in case we got blacklisted somewhere. Tried a packet capture but don't really see any traffic going to the IP the domain resolves too. The site works fine outside the network. I have contacted them to see if they have any clue why. Anything else I should try?

My phone hasn't rung and when I picked up my normal phone my boss said that I'm being unresponsive and why haven't I been answering emails because we have a couple sites that are down. He said that I should be monitoring tickets and emails. And I am infringing on what we spoke about when I got my warning. My phone hasn't rung and my work phone was charging. Also my normal phone has a problem where every hour or so I get notifications in waves and doesn't help the fact that we have a shared inbox that once someone else reads it the notification goes away. But I feel like I am on call and I am salary isn't this wrong that I have to be checking emails and tickets even if I don't receive a call?

 Currently, I just run all the WordPress sites on my server directly and they all share one MySQL/MariaDB instance. However, sometimes there are things to be done via ssh, or they want a db dump or a backup etc.
 I was wondering if anyone could think of a good way how I can give those people more access to their own WordPress sites without giving them access to the server or other people's sites with the least work for me. I was thinking of deploying WordPress and MySQL in a docker container and just installing ssh in that docker container so everyone could access their own container?

 I have to write a document describing IT infrastructure of a real-world company/business including hardware, software, network components and deciding whether to use cloud infrastructure or tradition infrastructure with on premises servers. I decided to choose car dealership company which would be small and more specific to design. We are allowed to design it as we think rather than finding the actual infrastructure of the chosen company. My chosen company is John Hughes which is a car dealership business here Australia, Perth, WA. 
 Any input on how to approach the design, components to think of and what components or how actual IT infrastructure looks like for a car dealership business would be highly appreciated. They would need support for inventory management, sales, customer relations but what else should I be thinking of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking into this for a while now, and still coming up short. We're a non-profit in a small country with horrible internet access. Our 4 locations are basically small, gated cities. The big center has essentially the leadership (government), a medical clinic, a store, a school, and 70 residences. Nearby is the airport and aviation team. The other 3 remote locations are each about 10 homes and an office. Each center relies on a single internet connection for everything (houses, et al) at that location.
 We have an IT team of only 6, all at the central location. Our documentation is old, disorganized, and thus hard to go through and find what you need. I think we're making progress though.
 Computers are a mixed bag of domain computers and BYOD. Letting a tool scan the network has always given unwieldy results or so many results there's not a clue where to start.
 The issue is that we have no idea WHAT we're managing, and that needs to change. We've setup a trial of iDoit and had a go. It's a nice tool, but perhaps too manual. We have PRTG that can help, but it's got so many alarms from "false" devices found during the auto-scan.
 The question is...what are others using for inventory and documentation? I'm looking for a tool that can tell me what devices are where with what configuration. Hopefully, something that can schedule maintenance and show a change history.
 I've been googleing on and off for months, finding a lot of sales pitches and promises. Maybe a short trial, maybe not. I'm hoping that by asking here, perhaps the options can be twiddled down to a good couple instead of what I'm (not) finding.

 I have successfully completed it as directed in the guide. The emails are being received on Gmail. However, my emails sent from custom email addresses are going to junk (outlook) and promotional tab (Gmail).
 I think the problem here is: DKIM record. I don't think Google allows to access the keys for a simple Gmail user. One has to sign in to Workspace which I think is not free.
 I have tested with an email tester.
 https://app.mailgenius.com/spam-test/5ecbb9
 How do I proceed with this?
 My goal is:
  
To send/receive domain emails on Gmail instead of using a custom SMTP.
 I prefer the freebie approach. Do let me know if there's any free SMTP that allows sending around 3000 emails/month.

 I used virtual box, made two virtual machines as per their requirements and enabled "share display" in them and it worked. But it has 1 second input lag and i couldn't lower it. Company thinks it because i am using virtualbox and wants me to make two virtual machines in the host machine without using virtual box/vmware.
 The host machine runs windows server 2019 datacenter edition and it can be changed if i need it. The virtual machine must run windows 10/11.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

 They've been licensed since day one, we use an assortment of Basic/Standard M365 licenses, they've never been deactivated or stripped of their license.
 The only thing that comes to mind and they have in common is every single one of them has had their licensing upgraded from Basic to Standard at some point.
 Everyone on the initial license plan is not affected, they have their Teams according to their M365 license.
 Has anyone encountered this behaviour? I'm not able to reproduce it while switching licensing plans for a user.

Regardless, after some initial training from the local Egg I did what I needed to keep this system afloat.

 Build a nonblocking and Fault-Tolerant network that accommodates 10,000 servers equipped with two 10Ge NICs.
 ​
 My answer, 
 To make it Fault-Tolerant I will have two routers between the routers on the client side and the external router which will be connected with other ASs. Configure one as the active and the other as the standby. The two routers will use Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol to achieve this.
 I wasn't able to say anything about which product to use so I said any router and switch that has 10Ge ports.

 Actual cell service has been getting worse and worse, especially since the 5G rollout. Anyone else notice this too? 
 T-Mobile is offering us and a buddy of mine in charge of a similar size account some unbeatable deals and savings to switch over to them. I’m a little reluctant because historically TMO has had less than great coverage than the big 2. But I think that has changed, at least from the testing I have done, I’m seeing better speeds and better coverage in most areas now. We do work all over our state, so it’s important that we have good coverage. 
 Am I making a mistake switching over to a smaller provider? Do you think I’ll have to deal with backlash? 
 My idea is to switch over 100+ iPads first since data on those isn’t a deal breaker like it would be for voice service. And do remote monitoring to see what the signal is in the areas we work, then if it’s a good fit, change over our smartphones. 
 Anyone else switch their company over and do you have any regrets?
 I don’t consider AT&T a viable option at this point as their 5G rollout is so far behind and I did a bunch of testing last year and was not impressed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've just had a new CCTV Camera system added to our corporate WLAN by an external 3rd party vendor. The system streams 12 odd cameras to a heads-up display. Its scope was to be viewed on a wired device at a Station but it's found its way to mobile devices (Tablets/Laptops) due to the flexibility and convenience this offers. Unfortunately, it doesn't optimize video well and is constantly eating around 100 Mbps (or more) per client. Our Wireless network is a Cisco-based WLC /w 802.11ac WAPs using 20 MHz wide channels for 2.4/5 GHz. So we're really only good for about 100 Mbps half-duplex. 
 I've been doing some thinking about the problem and I cannot see if we can resolve this with the current Wireless setup even if we moved to wider channel widths or newer 802.11 technology. Not only would wider channels hurt the setup of the entire building but even with 2 clients, we're going to have sub-optimal performance for all other clients in that airspace.
 Am I just underestimating the performance of the newer standard 802.11ac/802.11ax, or is this use-case better suited for Wired?

 Is it not designed to allow multiple SRPs and everything is supposed to be in one? One of them applies to a wider user base than the other, which is why there are two separate GPOs.
 Edit: I see that it is actually allowed but happens when it thinks there is a conflict so the better question is- why does it think there is a conflict? One of them is the path to Firefox, the other is the path to Zoom. Two different locations entirely. I'm not understanding where the conflict is.

 Your employer wants to let you walk after resigning? You thing they are idiots for letting you go? You think they can’t survive without you? You “built it with your barehands” and they can’t figure out your expert work? You think that matters? You think you can get a big payday by "sticking around" if you negotiate?
 If you believe for a second that a former employer, who screwed you over and underpaid you, will be kinder to you as a contractor? You are wrong. You are living a fantasy if you believe it.
 So, just ask them for $200 per hour to help them after you go. Easy money and you’ll show them how important you are. You’ll make a fortune proving them wrong. What can go wrong?

 So when I enter app1.tunnel.example.com sometimes it is redirected to 1.1.1.1 server and sometimes to 2.2.2.2
 app1.tunnel.example.com, app2.tunnel.example.com..etc are dynamically generated, these are tunnels to privateIP exposed service, and the other end of the tunnel, the publicIP part from which you have access on the internet, is either server-1 1.1.1.1 or server-2 2.2.2.2, depending on which IP tunnel.example.com DNS has returned (load balancing between the 2 IPs)
 My problem is that sometimes the tunnel for app1.tunnel.example.com is on Server 1, but when acessing this host, the loadbalancer routes this traffic to server 2, and it results on an error
 I have actually made nginx reverse proxy to the end of the tunnel, sith proxy_pass
 What I want, I don't know if it's possible with Nginx, is if the proxied server returns 404 on server 1, then re-route the request to the other nginx reverse-proxy server 2, but the URL has to remain app1.tunnrl.example.com on the search bar, 
 is it even networkingly possible? If yes and nginx is not the answer, then what could it be?
 Below is How I want the nginx.conf to look like on server1:
 Server { Listen 80; Location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4444/; proxy_intercept_error on; } error_page 404 = @redirect; location @redirect { return 301 http://$host ON 2.2.2.2; #host here is app1.tunnel.example.com } }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone here have any familiarity with setting this up?
 I've just started a new job in a busy hospital laboratory, and sooo much time could be saved if the normal values just auto-verified in the computer without a lab tech having to pull it up in the computer, scan it, then hit verify to send the results to the EMR. Right now, only some of their chemistry tests auto-verify, so I know it's possible. I'm gathering that the IT department there is notoriously slow (likely understaffed and not exactly giving priority to some lab passion project, understandably).
 Lab is on Cerner Millenium. I'm assuming that the set-up for this occurs in Cerner, but how? I've been taking some basic developing courses and would be happy to do this on the side as a portfolio project, but I don't even know if that's possible or where to start. Obviously I'd have to talk to IT at some point but hoping to get some input here before I even bring it up (in case it's absolutely crazy).
 As a side note, their Cepheid (COVID instrument) is not interfaced to Cerner at all, so they're manually typing in the 100s of Flu/COVID/RSVs they get in a day and then having a 2nd tech do a clerical check, which is absolutely bananas for the volume they get. If anyone knows where to start on that one as well, I'd love to attempt to tackle it if it's even remotely possible.
 TIA (and sorry if this is the wrong sub - I also posted in r/healthIT but not sure if that was right either - please redirect me)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm a hardware engineer at some company. We have a device we collect data with that spits data out to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has compiled code on it that saves the data to its local files and sends these files back to a lab PC over a closed wifi network. None of these devices are connected to the internet.
 During our testing, we're using Matlab to perform our testing procedures. Our auxiliary hardware is all reliant on proprietary Matlab drivers.
 To send commands to the RPi, we currently use Matlab to make a system call to Putty, which SSH's into the RPi and executes local code on the RPi. We need to do this hundreds of times per test, and it currently takes a couple seconds per Putty call, so the time stacks up. To push/pull files off the RPi, we have Matlab make a system call to an SFTP server.
 My question is: how would you execute the commands on the RPi faster than making system calls to Putty? My scenario to test speed is to execute a copy file command from Matlab 20 times, and time the results. Number to beat is about 40 seconds for those 20 copies. I've tried using the Paramiko library in Python, but it was slower than Putty. I've also tried using a 3rd party Matlab plugin based around the Ganymede Java library, but there's some problem with keys on our model of Rpi, even when I manually try to add keys to the RPi. My next move is a Python library called ssh2-python, but I need to get Visual on the lab PC, which will take some time given our IT situation.
 I was also toying with the idea of using TCP sockets in either Python or C++, but I'm not really familiar with TCP. I'm not a network person, so I'm kind of blindly stumbling from potential solution to potential solution. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I‘m currently playing around with TLS ans self-signed certificates for internal services. There are quite a lot of tutorials on how to generate a root ca and an intermediate CA, while there are also Howtos for generating TLS certificates.
 As far as I understood, you sign the CSR of your intermediate by your root ca and your SSL csr by your intermediate CA. You import and trust the root ca and every certificate signed by the intermediate should be trusted too.
 Well. That doesn’t work. If I, for example, check the certificate of google with MacOS Certificate Assistant, the whole chain of trust is visible. If I check my certificate, I only see the TLS cert and the assistant cries about the untrusted intermediate certificate.
 It looks like the chain between root and intermediate is broken. If read the Wikipedia article about x509 and the lead me to more questions. It looks like the certificate only contents some basic information about it’s ca (in my case the intermediate) like public key ,algorithm, etc. but no information about the root ca. How ist my browser supposed to know who signed the intermediate ?
 Or is the information on Wikipedia not complete and I have to bundle the CAs certificates with my TLS cert ?
 I have an headache now. Please help me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 At my job, I'm in charge of developing a solution to a very disorganized team's bottlenecks. 
 One thing I've noted is that they use a Windows share for file storage when their volume is well behind what I feel that's meant to handle. They have a root directory with 115k (at present) folders that all have six or seven files a piece. The files are necessary for the cases they're working, and the 115k items in their inventory account for 3 months worth of work. The file share will lag for up to a minute before loading on occasion.
 I don't have experience in this area, but I'm certain there has to be a better solution than this.
 What would you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello peoples, I use a Load Balancer from OVH (french servers provider). Everything works on HTTP on the port 80 but when I switch to HTTPS on port 443 I get an error 503. 
 I correctly set my SSL certificate on the load balancer, but I think the issues comes from my servers, my servers listen on port 80 and I don’t have any SSL certificates on my servers behind the LB.
 But I don’t understand, why the LB doesn’t transfer the SSL certificat to the server farm ? 
 I hope somebody here will take the time to help, feel free to ask questions but I think I give as many details as I can.
 Thanks and good Saturday to all of you.

 I have tried Pfsense which has data quotas, but users can easily circumvent the hard limits by re-logging in to the captive portal. I have also tested Pfsense captive portal with freeradius plugin. But I found that it's buggy and running a MySQL server was a hassle. 
 I recently stumbled upon Sophos firewall which seems to have per user data quotas. But many users have reported certain issues related to UI and stability. 
 So, can anyone suggest me a good open source firewall with reliable per user data quotas.

 Manually speaking, The driver consists of 4 files that are inside a .cab file, once extracted from the cabinet, the installation involves running cmd as an admin and using pnputil on one of the files to install.
 ​
 How would i go about deploying this to the company portal through intune?
 I tried extracting the .cab on my machine and making a .intunewin file from the directory with the install command utilizing the pnputil command, but it doesnt seem to do anything, the installation fails immediately.
 i also tried making the .intunewin from the .cab itself, also without success
 ​
 any ideas how i should go about this issue?
 a powershell script seems to be the answer, but im not much of a powershell scripter :\
 ​
 ** The whole point of this is that non-admin users could install those drivers without needing to open cmd as admin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been having some thoughts lately about the point I’m at in my career and comparisons with colleagues and friends at various points in their career. One thing I’ve realized with myself is that I’m always too modest about my achievements and efforts. I downplay anything that I’ve done that goes above and beyond and brush off any praise I receive as “just doing my job”. I try too hard to not be the big showboating guy gloating about how many goals I’m kicking and don’t want anything to think that I’m bragging about something. 
 I feel like there’s a difference between being proud of a big achievement and making a huge deal out of something that was really minor. Looking around though I see people that are shameless about claiming credit for something that they both had very little to do with and also really isn’t that important in the grand scheme of things so they get ahead. Is modesty seen as a weakness in career endeavors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Our org is 100% Cloud - all in on O365. We use SharePoint for file management and many of our staff use the onedrive app to sync folders to their pc's. Twice this year (so far), users have deleted massive folders/files (10-50k files) because they wanted to get rid of the sync'd folder on their pc - when they should have simply stopped the sync in the onedrive app.
 As you can imagine, doing massive restores from the recycle bin is extremely time consuming and it's tricky restoring from our cloud backup provider as it's usually not the entire site that is deleted.
 I was hoping MS had a policy we could set to stop bulk deletions (max deletions at a time = 20 or something along those lines), but from what i read and what MS support tells me, the only way to stop these deletion is to remove 'delete' permissions from all of our permissions, except for a select few staff. This also appears to disable renames as well.
 Is that truly the only way to stop this from occurring? Are there any O365 SharePoint settings to stop deletions in general? 
 Thanks for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I started a new job and in a process of modernizing my network. The current network is a huge layer2 domain. The customers are in R&D and use a lot of multicast and broadcast. I am planning to turn this network into layer3 since 90% of our traffic is east-west. I am thinking to implement the spine-leaf topology. And utilize vrf-lite for each customer. My network is spread between five different buildings. The farthest building is probably 3000ft away from the main one. Also, the fiber between buildings is either OM1 except for the farthest one.
 It seems like I am going to be using Cisco C9300 and C9500 (or maybe 1u Nexus switch)
  
Can I use C9300 as leaf switches?
 Can I use C9500 for my spines?
  
I am thinking to deploy a couple of leaf switches to each build. I am not sure if this is a good idea or not. My understanding of the spine-leaf network, the vrf-lite exists only at the leaf level. If I have a tenant that happened to be located at two different buildings, the tenant's VLANs will be extended via vxlan / l2vpn. Am I right about this? Does the VLAN in bldg A need to match the VLAN ID in bldg B for the same tenant?
 Also, I am still wrapping my head how the routing between tenants. Since each tenant will be placed in a vrf-lite, then I would have to use route-leaking. Do I need to create an ACL on the leaf switches if the traffic between tenants must be restricted based on their applications (e.g. ssh, ftp, etc.) only?
 For my infrastructure, servers (AD, NTP, DNS, DHCP, ISE etc), Docker containers, end-users, and oob (ipmi and network management), should I put these on their own vrf-lite or should I put them on the master/default table? What is the best practice for infrastructure?
 ​
 Thank you

 I'm just curious on what other network engineers thoughts are on ciscos SD wan.
 Specifically, if you've worked with it, have you implemented it, or taken over?
 What components of it do you use?
 What do you like about it?
 In what situation would it be the best bet to deploy and why?
 How much does your org spent on it? What caused them to pay for it?
 The way I see it, the SD WAN full deployment is a super expensive system that completely is maintained by licensing, even though the equipment can technically perform the job already.
 Thanks!!

Current set up below:
 Coax > Modem > Ethernet > Router > Ethernet > Firewall. 
 The connection from the ISP router to the firewall is connected to one of the ISP router's switch ports. My opinion is its probably best to plug the VOIP provider's device needing a public IP directly into one of the other ISP router's switch port. It doesn't seem practical to try to put the VOIP device behind the firewall because that would need some SNAT config and it needs to be public facing. 
 What do you think? Still green at this so any/all input is appreciated. Thanks!

 Does any have any recommendations or have you run into this before?

 i moved on to back end app support, new people took over servers, devs finished their replacement in 2 years instead of less than 3 months and the server can be turned off right? sure. 
 then there were some VM host issues, some data storage problems, VMware helped the new server team recover everything, and the server re-appears. as i am recovering some of the systems i support, i notice the name and let them know, they delete it again. 
 forward 2 years, some update fails, working with VMware again to fix things, pops back into existence. I notice it... again. 
 more issues.... reappears...
 again..
 today is the 7th time in 10 years i have seen this fucking server that wont die. 
 I think its taunting me. oh, and my co-workers are incompetent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've managed my organization's Adobe licensing for over 3 years now, and I can't express enough how much I fucking loathe dealing with this company.
 Every single renewal has been plagued by licensing issues, and Adobe employees know fuck all about their own software. If I'm instructed to log out and back into an Adobe ID as a resolution one more time, I swear to fuck something is getting burnt down. Issues are inconsistent; some users can use the entire suite, others none of it, a few can use everything besides Acrobat. Even worse, my licensing provider will tell me something is included (such as Adobe Sign) and Adobe tells me that it isn't.
 So that leaves me, stuck in the middle, screaming like an absolute Karen, "We paid for licensing, fucking fix it!" I feel as if I'm screaming into the void, with no solution in sight, all the while staff can't perform their duties from lack of access.
 Has anyone experienced similar issues with this shit-show of a company or has any suggestions? Neither Adobe or my licensing provider has been able to provide a fix in over a month, and I'm at wits end.
 Edit: So fun fact, Adobe Sign doesn't come with Creative Cloud K-12 Shared Device licensing, so if an Adobe employee tells you otherwise, you call them a damn dirty liar. It took A MONTH for Adobe to figure that out. Guess we can't even expect them to do sales correctly either.

 Often when moving things around I have to troubleshoot connectivity issues on the FC clients by looking for the beam of light in patch panels, HBAs, etc…. This is probably very not good for my eyes which are already not great to deal with. 
 Is there some sort of tool I can get that’ll allow me to plug it into a LC port and confirm signal without having to blind myself? Or am I overthinking the dangers of staring into light??
 Also on the copper side, I’m trying to see if there’s a tool I can plug into a RJ45 port to see if its unpatched, which switch it’s patched to, and if there’s a cable failure somewhere down the line.

 Full disclaimer: I am not an IT-professional but rather a user seeking advice since the field im in is quite sparse with IT professionals in the "middle-ground" and my go-to IT guy rarely deals with the bandwith/use-cases I work in.
 I do own a small post-production studio (1-3 users) which is currently based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet (speaking Cisco SG-X series) connections with Intel/ATTO NICs. I have 3-4 Workstations with 2-3 file-servers and an LTO-Library working in parallel all using 10Gbase. 
 I want/need to upgrade this to fiber to reduce energy-costs and to future-proof the setup and be able reach 25GB speeds (only with some flash/NVME applications/transfers).
 Due to the recent energy costs in europe and the implementation of more network applications (Adder Infinity KVM and Dante audio-networking in my case) I was thinking thinking If I could consolidate the switches and instead run everything in the studio with one (core)switch?
 If that is a terrible idea - let me know. 
 I thought about investing into an FS.Com Switch* like the S5860-48SC, but of course I already read here that people are still sceptic about the software/interface. 
 *(If I recall correctly most switches nowadays are white-labels and every vendor applies their firmware/implementation?)
 Any advice on how to future proof upgrade from 10G is appreciated.
 Since I already run my video on fiber I can easily upgrade the whole facility to fiber step by step since I am due to rewiring anyways. 
 If my post fails to live up to the rules of this subreddit just let me know before deleting.
 Thanks in advance!

I was recently having connectivity issues between DCNM and the switches and to troubleshoot TAC support had me remove one of the leaf switches from DCNM, which then warned me about and removed it's VPC partner as well.
 After we resolved the connectivity issue, we attempted to add back in both leaf switches (preserving config) and it's throwing this error.
 "Cannot add a Brownfiled switch [serial number] to the fabric unless all existing switches are pending Brownfiled migration."
 I read this as I need to remove the other 4 switches and try adding them back all in at once as brownfield preserving config.
 Has anyone had to do this or run into this error before? Will the config actually be preserved and not cause any issues? Will I lose all my logged fabric changes since greenfield config or will it pick back up where I left off? Thanks.

I'm the one who is responsible for responding to security incidents and I'm accountable in a lot of ways for keeping the doors shut tight. When someone goes wrong, I'm the person they ask to fix it, I'm the one giving updates, and I'm the one suggesting and implementing changes when it's over.
 VIPs made a last minute request to install a VPN onto their personal devices ASAP. I questioned this and was told it's fine, but it isn't sitting well with me. I'm thinking about bringing it up a level because if a user did this I'd be pissed.
 I suggested consumer VPNs and reminded my manager that we know nothing about these devices, have not given any instructions on the use of the VPN, and this will expose our secure network which in all other circumstances we are very protective of. 
 Usually this manager can see reason, I'm not really getting this. It's like I'm talking to an end user. One of the VIPs doesn't even work in our company, it's a friend.
 I'm just doing it, but we go through so much effort to keep our network secure, jumping through hoops and implementing rigorous compliance standards, rolling out lengthily policies and reworking our internal processes to avoid creating gaps like this, only for what... some VIPs want to go on vacation and can't pay $10 for a month of Mozilla VPN.

We're a small local college looking to provide wifi access to students in some of our parking lots for after hours or pandemic restrictions. We would hang these on the outside second floor of buildings that border the selected parking lots. Our network is all Meraki (switches and inside AP) and can support the outdoor AP with either copper or fiber. Parking lots average about 200' x 200' and we can hang up to 3 or 4 AP's on most of the buildings facing the lots. So what is suggested for such an application?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work with a lot of developers, and many are *terrible* at installing instructions in documentation. They skip steps, put in wrong steps, or their install process is outdated.
  
Go to website foo and download foo.app.gz [link is broken] "Oh, yeah, it's a git download." [git link doesn't work] "Try this other link."
 Unzip foo.app.gz, go into the "install" directory, and run "setup.sh" [there is no "install directory" nor is there a "setup.sh"]
 "Oh yeah, run 'configure' then 'make all'." "There is no makefile." "You have to download that separately on another website, I forget where." "Okay, that's pretty vital." "Ask Dan."
 "Did Jim tell you to run configure? No no, run 'setup.sh' and ... there is no setup? When did they remove that?" "Who is 'they', here?" "Let me see what's going on, share your screen.... oh, I have never seen THAT before. Did you run brew bar-app-libs?" "This is a Linux box, not a Mac." "Okay, well, there is a Homebrew for linux, so get that..."
 "I know that Jenkins said every build has failed, but ignore that, and download this weird obscure package manager..."
  
And so on. I remember one developer was so mad his docker build didn't work, he said, "I thought you said you knew Linux?" and I wanted to punch him. He couldn't get it to work, either, and blamed my environment. And after I looked at his dockerfile, there was no way it would have worked; even the syntax was wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All! 
 How do you keep your AD user employee details up do date? 
 All the employee metadata in the user account like Job Title, Department, Company, Manager name, phone numbers, address etc. might be superfluous in a basic org but become more useful when AD SSO is integrated with other enterprise systems such as Helpdesk that can leverage this info for approvals or hardware provisioning, etc. 
 So how do you do keep track of the constant changes to job titles, employee relocations, etc. Is IT normally burdened with this? We are considering offloading this task to HR as this seems more within their realm of responsibility, but we are unsure what the best way to go about it is. Do you provide direct AD access to those non-IT users? Do you use third party software? Also, what permissions are used? 
 -Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I have a few Cisco switches on my network and want to add another one but I don't do it often so I want to make sure I don't mess it up since it's been a while. Some kind of an initial setup checklist such as this one would be helpful but it doesn't mention anything about VTP so I'm wondering if there is anything else I'm missing? The "new" switch was on another network before and I already wiped it (write erase) and deleted the VLAN database (delete flash:vlan.dat). Is there anything else to be done before configuring and then connecting to my network?

 Yet they had no IT. No MSP to support them. No "I used to be an IT manager" people. Nothing.
 It honestly astounded me that they lasted this long without burning to the ground. But the longer I've been here, the more I've come to realize that it's because they went with such a simple technology stack that they could get away with it. Here's a few things they did:

 is there any level of micro segmentation in place?
 How is it being done now or in the past?
 Where are you moving to?
 What are your experiences with it?
  
Just a North-South firewall?
 Is it done VLAN based, terminated on a firewall? 
 Which things do you group together on a VLAN?
 Large security enclaves / zones, for example a VRF sandwiched firewall?
 Anyone using Cisco ACI, just 'network centric', or going more to a 'application centric'/ more segmented approach?
 Anyone using NSX (VLAN backed or overlay)?
 Or using host based firewalling?
  
How do you operate the segmented datacenter? What procedures are in place? What tools do you use?

As these are discontinued, I am looking to move to the CBS350 range to keep things relatively consistent.
 In Australia, these are all basically non-existent for at least 52+ weeks. However, I have found the exact same models (albeit an NA model vs AU model) on US sites, in stock and available to ship.
 Apart from obvious conundrums around support should something go wrong or become faulty, is there any reason a USA version of a Cisco product would not work in Australia? All the switches I'm interested in have world PSU's, so that shouldn't be an issue.

 iam new hear. Yes, also as a IT Sys Admin Junior Possition. Ill get to the Point right away: We manually extend the Size of our Mailboxes (Exchange) from our users (around 1000) , everytime they send us a ticket and we extend it 20% . I wonder is there a chance to create a PS String Skript, which will check automaticly all users - lets say every week - check the mailboxes , and when the mailbox is at 80% of the size it will extend the mailboxsize 20% 
 maybe there is already a solution for this, but i cant find it.

 No current documentation is a available, people don't necessarily know where all of the network equipment is, there might be undocumented/rogue gear, and there might be orphaned VPN links to third parties that people have forgotten about. There is no current network engineer to ask, the last one died/retired/wandered off.
 Once I identify all active, reachable networks then I can sort and document them, create a list of points of contact and so on. Then for mystery networks start to dig, probe and eliminate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have an question.
 We are starting a new application from a 3th party Supplier and need some basic information from you guys.
 Since all those new machines will be pushed with WDS+ workbench and joint in our AutoPilot section. There still some things WDS+ autopilot cannot do.
 And therefore my opinion is to use GPO's.
 We have 2 Domain controllers (second one is for backup) 1 Wsus server 1 file server (locally) + veaam backup enabled ** On the Fileserver WDS+workbench
 So that specific application needs to have an folder (user based, not Computer based) 
 So we created a folder with the content of the requested software in it. It is shared now. And now it needs to take that folder and copy it to the user profile of the machine.
 How to setup this 
 Is this possible? I think it is, but now knowing for sure. The 3th party group provided us the installation document. But the part for copy folder to user via wds+workbench is not in there, for them it is copy paste.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to work out how we can have multiple tenants that are accessible by individual tenant administrator accounts. The documentation and web interface don't specify how a user logging in can specify the tenant they want to administer. I have Active Directory SSO working, so our tenant administrators get logged in automatically to the first tenant I created. However, if I create additional tenants and want certain users to have access to these in addition to our primary tenant, how do I grant access and have a way for the user to choose the tenant they login to? I see no way to grant permissions to the tenants to say which accounts have access, and if I try and use the same username on different tenants, it fails and says the user already exists.
 I think I may be fundamentally missing some crucial information on how this works.

 Hi,
 We have some places whereby we are alloted a single private IP inside of that company and we manage the networking infrastructure (IPS, switches, APs, etc.) under a double NAT situation, where our first gateway router is behind a NAT.
 Without an open port to the public facing internet, is there a way to still use TR-069 for our gateway device?
 -----------------------------------
 Essentially, this is what I want:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069#Connection_request_over_NAT
 I've been researching how to use STUN for a few days now with no breakthrough, from my research it seems possible, and that I need to utiltise the same UDP port when traffic is coming back to the CPE equipment to do so. I'm open to exploring other open source ACS servers as well that has an easier implementation for NAT traversal via STUN or XMPP.
 Thank you.

 I am trying to use a PowerShell script for enabling and enforcing MFA for users in O365. The issue I'm having isn't with the script itself, it is when I try to automatically run the PowerShell. I get the authentication popup looking for credentials. I've found some articles that'll let you put your username and password into the script so you don't need to authenticate before running the script. The password is in plain text which I'm not good with. Is there a way to connect to O365 and run a PowerShell script without having to manually run it and authenticate? Also, my understanding on Microsoft Graph is limited at the moment, but I suspect there maybe a way to use Graph for this?

If I close the Microsoft login prompt it works for a while then disconnects and asks the Microsoft login again...
 The Exchange autodiscover is correct and only pointing to itself but if I use Outlook's Automatic configuration tester it immediately asks me for a Microsoft login, then if I close that it correctly asks for the domain credentials and once I provide that it gets the correct on-premises autodiscover information.
 The only detail I can think of is that we have a 365 tenant with some of the same email accounts as on-premises but it's only for Microsoft Teams, Exchange online is not configured anywhere at all, it's not even licenced.
 I've tried adding the autodiscover xml to the Outlook registry but it makes no difference, it's like it always phones home to Outlook before trying the actual email server domain.
 Has anyone had this issue before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Friday Sysadmins! Do you have any plans this weekend? If not, I might have something you can sink your teeth into... Number Matching in MS Authenticator. 
 It's a feature which essentially rather than prompt a user for a "yes/no" "approve/deny" response on their phone, asks a user to enter a number into a prompt box. This effectively blocks an attacker from flooding their phone with MFA requests, fatiguing them into accepting, thinking it's something they've done wrong; because the user will never see the number and the attacker will instantly know that attack won't work.
 This feature went GA last week but some of you may have had it in preview for the last couple of months, it's pretty solid and I thoroughly recommend it. From a users perspective, it's no more effort than an old school SMS code, and a tiny bit more than hitting "approve"
 The only thing I dislike about it from a users perspective, is that I can no longer simply hit "approve" from my Apple watch.. so be mindful of that with your execs and managers, I guess..?
 My video talking about it, demoing it and showing you where the settings are in Azure AD can be found here:
 https://youtu.be/cjsViEclw1I
 Apologies for the croaky voice, I'm unwell but wanted to get my weekly video out there and keep up with helping the small community of followers I've been working with for the past couple of months.
 If anyone wants any help with this, hit me up!

 If you have a fibre run, and you connect two switches with 1Gbps transceivers, you get 1Gbps link. Yay.
 I'm trying to determine if "old" fibre is perfectly fine if it still works. You either get a 1Gbps connection or you don't - or - signal degradation and packet loss could mean a functional connection with a seriously low maximum capability even though the link is established at 1Gbps.
 What happens over time? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? Does the capability of the medium degrade and lose performance? Do you get "indicated" 1Gbps right up until the point where you get no link? Do you get indicated 1Gbps but no where near the 1Gbps throughput and packet loss? 
 It's been quite hard to search for the answer, and I think I'm just using the wrong search terms, or this isn't widely discussed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sysadmin working for a pharma manufacturing company in a small 3 employees IT team. Our production has been adding some IoT devices connected directly to prod machines for some years. These devices needs outgoing internet traffic with some Azure/DNS/NTP servers. The way I handled it is I whitelisted the needed IP on the firewall.
 But as time goes, it gets complicated to manage these firewall WAN IP whitelisting, and I'm wondering if it is worth it. 
 In résumé, is it overkill to use Wan ip whitelisting for security purpose if iot device is initiating the internet traffic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would anyone be able to explain how this has been spoofed to show the .pdf extension at the end of the file name?
 Sample 1 which is a standard .html file is as expected - sample1.html
 Sample 2 which is the malicious JS obfuscated page which slipped through a filter contains .htm and then .pdf so the file properties displays this as .htm - malware mth.pdf
 This should have been caught by our filter but the double extension has caused it to not be picked up. I was trying to replicate this but I was having mixed results. I first tried copying the file name as its written with mth.pdf and it changed to a PDF. I then tried playing with the RTLO but this is pretty much patched by most browsers.
 Does anyone know how this was achieved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 it has been a long time since I last used group policies to administer servers or other computers. Right now we have a terminal server which everyone logs into and uses. I want to prevent certain users from turning off the server by applying the specific group policy rule. From my memory, I think I did the right steps but just now I tested it and it didnt work. I did the following steps:
  
Move Terminal Server to OU 'Servers'
 Link GPO to 'Servers' with User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar > Remove and Prevent Access to the shutdown command activated. 
 Link another GPO to 'Servers' with Computer Configuration\ Administrative Templates\ System\ Group Policy\Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode activated.
 Set security group for both only allowing the Standard-User Group to apply the policy.
 gpupdate on terminal server
  
What I expect to happen is the machine reading the loopback policy on startup, however I'm not sure if I just prevented that using a security-group. Do I need to include the machine itself inside the security group? How is it different than using "authenticated users". 
 After reading the loopback policy, the Server tries to read the user config policy but ignores it, because it is not a user. Now when a user logs into the machine, although not being inside the OU, the user reads the user configuration from the policy because loopback is applied and applies the policy, when the user is a member of the security group. 
 I'm certain I made a mistake somewhere because otherwise it would work. 
 ​
 Thanks for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have SQL 2019 STD RDS that is not domain joined and it's only accessible inside VPC (no public IP). I have an internal AD domain and several web servers joined to that internal AD inside VPC. MDTC is configured to with no auth on those EC2 instance and also on RDS. When I try distributed transaction initiated from the web app (on the EC2 instance) I get following error:
 "The MSDTC transaction manager was unable to pull the transaction from the source transaction manager due to communication problems. Possible causes are: a firewall is present and it doesn't have an exception for the MSDTC process, the two machines cannot find each other by their NetBIOS names, or the support for network transactions is not enabled for one of the two transaction managers. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004D02B)" 
 DNS resolution should be working on that RDS, I can't check since xp_cmd_shell can't be enabled to try it out so RDS should resolve EC2 instances, DNS servers are set on VPC DHCP settings. Security rules are currently to allow everything while I am troubleshooting. I did everything like I usually do without RDS
 RDS option group settings
 ENABLE_SNA_LU true ALLOW_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS true ALLOW_INBOUND_CONNECTIONS true ENABLE_XA true TRANSACTION_LOG_SIZE 4 AUTHENTICATION NONE 
 The only question left here is, do I need active directory joined RDS for this to work (and ofc all servers joined to that same AD)? From all the docs and videos available this should work, but didn't find info anywhere is being part of AD hard prereq or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 We are using Microsoft 365 E5 our data is still on the on-premise fileserver, we use Exchange Online for email.
 I've been asked to come up with a solution for the following "problem". 
 The company wants to do some compliance checks on outgoing email, but only on some pre-defined checks;
 - More than 10 external recipients in to, cc or bcc
 - More than 50 internal recipients in to, cc or bcc
 - Attachments with information such as addresses or financial data to external recipients. 
 With the 'checks' above, there need to be some actions configured;
 - Block message (quarantaine) with message "Are you sure you want to sent this message" if 'yes' then send.
 - Block message (quarantaine) with message "Message blocked due to high amount of external recipients".
 - Block message (sent to manager for approval)
 - Block message with message "Contact IT for additional support" 
 I've been digging around and could not come up with a solution for this.
 Only things i could find where;
 - Limit the total recicpients per message
 - Limit the total recipients you can mail to per hour/day
 - Sent all external mail for approval to a manager 
 Does anyone knows a possible solution for this within the Microsoft e5 suite? 
 Thanks!

 If it is true that I can do that, why would I? Doesn't it make more sense to just use AD directly?
