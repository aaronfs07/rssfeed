 Did anyone here ever use it? If so: why? What are the benefits? What are the ways to use it. I am not talking about the vPro/AMT extensions; just raw IME.
 Edit: Just saw that I forget the word "Engine" in the title. Oh well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple years ago, the company I was working for was acquired by a much larger corporation. They never said my job was safe, but the people I was working with reassured me my job was going to be safe. Long story short, after a year, I completed a ton of migration work (pretty much everything) but immediately after I was sent on my way. (I don't hold a grudge against them, I get it, they had teams to do what I was doing by myself.) I did all the sysadmin work and the netadmin work. We would hit up a trusted MSP if I didn't know what to do with the networking side of things. 
 Before the acquisition I was doing everything outside of ERP work. I've been in the sysadmin role for over a decade. Anything Windows that you throw at me I'm fine with... Some linux i'm ok with. I'm pretty good with configuring network equipment, not super advanced. But I'm comfortable with configuring switches and firewalls. Not an expert, but I can work my way around it. 
 When recruiters hit me up, about 75% of them want some intro level NOC role. Others are trying for a senior networking role. I don't think I'm ready for a senior networking role right now, but I think I could be ready within a couple months if given the opportunity. 
 Sorry, I'm kinda rambling because I've had a few beers and I don't know what to do.
 I've had multiple interviews. I've made it known what I'm looking for compensation wise. So I don't know if I'm outpricing myself. But I've never even been lowballed with an offer. 
 I've gotten interviews but not for every job I've applied for, so maybe my resume is garbage? I just don't know what to do.

 My superiors are currently adamant on keeping RDP open when the server is public facing so as to make any configuration changes remotely. I suggested to him that this is a very insecure method of operating and that is when he tasked me with coming up with a solution for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 So I have a scenario that I’d like some advice on. I have an HP enterprise blade server with a single NIC in it that has two ports. It’s runner Windows Server 2019 with a Hyper V instance that I’d like to Run Untangle on. Now the question is, can I use one port on the NIC as Hyper V’s WAN and the second as a LAN for the internal network that would then be handled by Untangle, or should I just create a scope within Win Server to issue IP’s Via DHCP on the NIC’s second port, or is any of this even possible because I have never attempted it myself. I understand it’s an odd request and it’s more for a Proof of Concept rather than production, but I’m trying to prove a point to a manager that took one network class and now believes themselves and expert. 
 I’m in essence trying to create a network on this blade while getting a DHCP assigned address from the actual production network at work. Running that traffic through untangle to a layer 3 switch/router then out to two Layer 2 switches that will then assign addresses to plugged in devices. It’s a mess admittedly but again this is a proof of concept. 
 I thank anyone who has advice or comments in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to what I know, lower metrics are preferred, but in this case, we have two vEdges routers (MPLS and Internet routers) that are both advertising default routing by using the command "default-info originate," in OSPF.
 The current problem is that the client claims that there are subnet traversing to MPLS routers, which are meant to traverse through the Internet to reach public servers. Upon checking the configuration. The MPLS metric is set to 50 and the Internet to 1, respectively. Internet should be preferred based on the metric they have. Another thing, there is only one point-to-point connection between each router and the core switch, I am unable to access or control those core switches. (refer to the diagram w/ issue)
 https://ibb.co/hRsGv29
 I've now tried setting the MPLS value to 1 and the Inet value to 50, and apparently they claim it works. Do you believe that this is possible, particularly in multi-homed connections? (refer to the diagram FIXED)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got hired in as a System Administrator role in an $100 million revenue Automotive company about 6 months ago... this job is so stressful, and I feel so under qualified. I worked as a mom and pop hardware shop PC repair technician before coming here and was very forthcoming with my skills, knowledge, etc when I interviewed for this role and they hired me.
 It felt like a lucky break and I was so excited to work in a real professional and corporate environment under an IT professional that has been in the biz for almost 30 years. 
 This was not what happened.
 My RM set me down and introduced me to a Team I'd be working with for support that i needed and they are based in India so I could come to them with any help I need. 3 weeks later, my RM leaves to UAE as well for an indefinite amount of time. Before he leaves, he gives me the most barebones training ive ever received and basically just told me to watch and learn and ill pick up everything i need that way. Every time I need access to something or to help someone out, I have to reach out to someone on my Team in India to grant access, monitor bandwidth, configure DNS, you name it, I pretty much have to ask someone to assist me because either I don't have the tools, or the understanding. Maybe it's a good thing as I don't know exactly what to do with the tools in the first place.
 Is this normal to be hired in like this and feel totally out of place and just constantly questioning if I'm doing a good job? Are there any tips anyone could give me or maybe empathize a bit?
 Any support is appreciated, 
 Much thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're starting the process of transitioning from 5508 WLCs to 9800-L-F WLCs. Our existing 5508s have around 100 APs (all 2700 and 2800 series) connected. I have the new WLCs set up in the same vlan and the plan is to eventually join the two WLC pairs in a mobility group to ease the transfer and eventually install all new 9115 APs but that's not what I'm asking about today.
 I have the 9800s configured and I have one spare 2702 AP that I'm trying to get connected to it.
 5508 IP is: 10.1.50.135 (/25)
 9800 IP is: 10.1.50.132 (/25)
 I set up an isolated DHCP server with option 43 set to the IP of the 9800s and made sure the test AP would reach out to this DHCP server for an address. This part is working. The problem is even after a full wipe (format flash:) and reload from scratch, and after seeing a console message that it properly receives the .132 address from the DHCP server, it then reaches out to .135 anyway and I have no idea why.
 Here's some selected console output to show what I mean:
 %DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface BVI1 assigned DHCP address 10.1.50.232, mask 255.255.255.128, hostname AP0081.c4fc.d39c %CAPWAP-5-DHCP_OPTION_43: Controller address 10.1.50.132 obtained through DHCP AP has SHA2 MIC certificate - Using SHA2 MIC certificate for DTLS. %CAPWAP-5-DTLSREQSEND: DTLS connection request sent peer_ip: 10.1.50.135 peer_port: 5246 
 This is after a full wipe and reload so I don't think there can be any leftover config pointing the AP to .135

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft licensing is obviously confusing as hell and our VAR reps do not seem to have the answers to this question. We do not use O365 (we are on GSuite) but we do want to get Intune working to manage Windows devices. Our main requirements are to get Autopilot working so that we can just mail new users laptops without having to image, use Intune to manage endpoint policies, and use Intune to manage updates (especially feature updates) for older versions of Windows 10.
 When I researched this previously the "EMS E3 (Enterprise Mobility + Security E3" license was supposedly the best option to get all of this. Our VAR seems to think, however, that this does NOT include Autopilot or the ability to push feature updates. Does anyone know if it does or does not? We would likely not use the security features (currently on Crowdstrike) unless it integrates well with our other security products. We are a non-profit so we are hoping we qualify for the non-profit licensing discount but our VAR also thinks that we may not (no idea why they think this). 
 We were also recommended to use this 3rd party site which also makes it seem like EMS E3 does not include Autopilot. However other people have told me that it does and that this site is incorrect.

 edit: This link makes it sound like EMS E3 MIGHT be all we need? But it is not quite clear:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/licensing-requirements
 TLDR: What is the cheapest licensing option to get us Intune + Autopilot + Windows Feature Updates patching ?

 SNMP server installation and setup was easy. No problem with the community name, read & read/write, starting the service, etc. But I'm missing something.
 I want to setup the SNMP service on the network so that we can leverage the native SNMP capabilities in Domotz. I want to get any/all SNMP alerts transmitted via the Domotz client to a distribution group.
 BTW - this network has NEVER seen SNMP. So it's a brand new installation.
 But something doesn't feel right. I think I'm missing a step with configuration? Or security? We're only starting with SNMPv2 at the moment. I have no idea how to setup v3 yet.
 Any ideas here? Any way to confirm its functionality? Most of the papers I've read have been awful.

 I'm creating the floor plan for a new building in ExtremeCloud IQ. There is a giant refrigerated section of the building that uses metal-coated foam insulated wall panels like this:
 https://www.kingspan.com/us/en/products/controlled-environments/cold-storage-panel-systems/ks-shadowline-interior/
 Does anyone know approximately how many dB loss those typically cause? I only ask because when drawing walls in their tool, they only have selections for concrete (12dB), drywall (3dB), brick, and just common stuff. I just want to know what type of wall would be the best substitute.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just had an interview with a company that reached out to me on LinkedIn. It was for a sysadmin position. I get on the interview, and they're looking for someone who can:
  
Do T1 Support for all their staff (worldwide)
 Do sysadmin duties like maintain their inventory/MDM
 Build out on-prem infrastructure and networks
 Deal with office facility issues, like changing light bulbs or calling a plumber. Because that makes sense.
 You are on your own, for the most part.
  
I know you aren't supposed to say compensation expectations in an interview, but when asked, I gave my range. I thought, surely the pay would be massive to compensate with the laundry list they want this person to do. They came back with, "that's pretty high, and a lot more than we envisioned for this role." Cool, hire someone else then, because that's my worth in this position!
 By the way, this is not a small company. I'd consider this a mid-sized global ~300 person company.
 These hybrid roles that mix several departmental duties on one person are getting way out of hand.

I created VLAN 110 on the core switch at our main site assined to a trunk port interface. The VLAN routes from the core firewall to our 2nd location's MPLS router which then reaches the firewall. That's where traffic stops. On the switch at the 2nd location I have added the vlan with an ip helper address to point back to our dhcp server at the main site. Everything in the firewall seems to be correct, but for some reason the route isn't passing through. Can anyone give me an example of a switch config that might be missing or would be necessary to allow VLAN 110 to pass through?

 Well the employee no call no shows his job after the second laptop showed as delivered and his managers are unable to get a hold of him. 
 I instructed finance I believe it to be wise to withhold his final paycheck until we receive our equipment. Sadly finance did not heed this advice maybe due to certain laws I'm unaware of, But we are now out the two devices and my parent company is telling me I need to follow up and get them back
 How do I proceed with something like this? Is local police an option in this context?

 ​
 That makes every azure admin a whale.
 ​
 This is not a post mortem post, instead I want to know how a decent whale organizes his workstation with security in mind, also to endorse/enforce this best practice to his henchmen. 
 ​
 These are the dimensions in that warped space :
  
use multiple VM's and RDP into them / use an RDP manager
 you can have multiple Displays
 
you can use the Workspace feature
 you can use RSAT tools / PS remoting
 per RDP session you can configure whether 1 or 2 displays are involved
 some mice have programmable buttons that help you scroll thru Workspaces
 you can use 65" TV screens if you want, IT is not poor where you work 
  
​
 These are the limitations:
 Must use 2 identities: a personal and an admin identity
 The admin account can not have access to Outlook or internet : vsphere/zabbix/jira .. only 
 The bare metal should be a Jumpstation as per MS best practice
 At least one VM for personal Identity, where Outlook lives and for general/genuine Internet work
 ​
 ​
 Challenges
 Many admin task involve cookbooks .. that are online.
 Workspaces are great until you discover that VM's you RDP into have workspaces as well. Your programmable mouse gets confused/freezes, forcing you to use the keyboard to 'pop' into the right level.
 You have to screenshot an error on a VM, but then waste time to find where your Outlook instance lives to get it sent to the ERP people.
 Running wayland on the bare metal for your three monitors isn't plug and play, nor is getting portreps working in linux
 You want Teams running as a singleton in your setup, but discover another instance has the camera locked. Or fights with Skype for Business for the dial tone.
 Your employer expects you to multi-task, obviously.
 ​
 ​
 How can it be done ?

 My team and I are working on a upcoming large/arena scale sized VR experience and some people would like to know what the best or most suggested routers for this setup would be:
  
60'x80' total coverage needed
 6 Meta Quest Pros, all using Wifi/Airlink
 6 individual desktops to power each individual headset
  
The headsets need to be able to talk/communicate to each other but do not need internet access, this is a local multiplayer experience. Wifi signal/coverage is extremely important too for quality to remain at the desired level. These are the general questions suggestions we are hoping someone could shed some light on:
  
What routers do we need to buy?
 And how are we doing the connections for each PC to each headset?
 Won’t each PC to headset connection require multiple routers?
 With each PC to VR headset on a separate connection and router?
 And then these routers cannot cover the whole space, so don’t we need a mesh network or wired connections to each of the routers in the ceiling?
  
Any help or recommendations on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

 And when I talk about logs I'm talking about all commands which a user types into the cli on a switch/router etc.
 We are trying to figure out when some vlans were created on our core as these have no description and no svi associated with them. No Mac addresses associated with them either so thinking on whether to delete them or not but need to know who and when they were created and why.

 I'm a one-man shop and I'm supporting an environment with a domain controller on 2012R2. I'm replacing this device as it is EOL in October, I need some help with best practices and ease of transition/migration.
 I'm not planning on performing an in place upgrade, I'm working on getting new hardware and licenses for a fresh install.
 I've read some information about adding the new server / DC to the existing one and then making it the primary and feel like this is the best way to go...however I want to add an additional difficulty into the mix. Currently the domain name is named with a prefix "abc.TLD.com" Since I'm not doing an an in place upgrade I want to fix this and change the domain name to just the TLD. I'm also not sure why this was done in the first place, is there any particular reason to do this that I might not be aware of?
 I want to hear your insights from anyone that has had to go through this on what is the best path to take. I'm primarily concerned with the downtime a new domain will cause as some of the equipment wont know how to find their dependent servers using DNS as well I'm concerned that permissions will be broken and how to best go about moving over OU's and security groups etc.

 Edit: we have a little over 200 students using Chromebooks as well as about 30 plus staff that use eye devices or their personal cell phones. They used to use jamf but they stopped using it they were also using netvision but also stopped using that so they're going off of Faith at this point and I'm trying to configure whatever I can through Google workspace which is what they have the devices on.

 english isn#t my native Language so keep that in mind =) Thanks in advance.
 First some information about the setup: We are using a SRV2019 Standard as an AD/DNS/DHCP Server. Newest updates and so on.
 Recently we had to register a website with a special character (ü) in the domain name field. When i try to resolve the name with nslookup <domainname> i get that the domain has not been found : Server failed. When i try the translated XN- adress it works. Is there a way to enable the translation of XN-Adresses(IDNs) ? I've tried to google obviously but the results are very bad. 
 Also when i do a nslookup from my homecomputer (W11) the address is translated to the XN-Adress.

If you're not familiar with RDS, it basically allows large amounts of users to rdp into a host or hosts that have a shared resource pool, and Guacamole is a browser based RDP server. This will allow us to cut back on computer labs and allow students to use windows based software on their chromebooks. When I set out to make it this way I could not find any clear documentation on how to set this all up and have Azure SAML working so I wrote some up in case anyone else wants to give it a try!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm little bit out of options with this one. Please advise. 
 The environment:
 Few Windows and Linux servers on the same network, which itself is firewalled, but no firewalls between servers in the network. One downstream WSUS server that's keeps Windows servers in the network up to date. No domain or DNS.
 Two of the servers are Windows 2019 SE HYPER-V hosts with few VMs. Let's call them HPV01 and HPV02. 
 Apart from the purposes of the VMs and IP addresses, these hosts are identical.
 HPV02 now lost the ability of accessing some shares on the network. There was no change in the configuration. Shares from the server itself are still accessible by others. The error message:
  
Network Error
 Windows cannot access \10.0.0.11
 Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To try to identify and resolve network problems, click Diagnose. 
 Error code: 0x80070035 The network path was not found. 
  
The address is correct, perfectly accessible from all the other servers in the network. Even by the VMs on the affected host. 
 It also lost access to the WSUS share by IP, but it's possible to access this share by WSUS server name, even tho there's no record in the hosts file. (how?)
 I tried all the possible solutions I could find on the internet. Lot of them for example here.
 Thank you for any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to open a port for a host on the other side of a Policy based IPSec tunnel. The reason I want to do this is because most of my sites sit behind a CGNAT and I'm not able to open up ports on those sites firewall. Well if I do it would be pretty useless haha
 The current network setup involves OPNSense in Azure as a hub and the sites connect to is so the can reach each other. They also use OPNSense as their firewall as well. 
 My subnets for each network are the following
 Azure: 10.0.0.0/24
 Site A: 10.1.0.0/24
 Site B: 10.2.0.0/24
 Site C: 10.3.0.0/24
 So basically what I'm trying to figure out is if I have a host on Site A is is possible to open a port on the Azure side of the tunnel and forward the traffic to back to the host on Site A?

 But we are having an unusual problem with it for some time now. It randomly freezes and nothing can get it back except reboot. Keyboard input, network, VMs, GUI, everything is down. If we connect monitor to the server we can see CLI, but unable to interact with it.
 Error that repeats itself in the logs just before the cluster freezes is: kernel BUG at net/8021q/vlan.h:47!
 We did some research and only documented case I can find is from oracle https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Sun%20Microsystems/2903057_1.html. But we dont have an oracle account and can not see the article.
 My question is if anyone had the same issue, if yes did you manage to solve the it? Or if it is ok to ask that here if anyone has an oracle account and is willing to send me the info from the article mentioned abovo, of course if there is something of interest for this specific problem in the article. 
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is happening across probably five or six vendors over the last year. Like the title says, if it isn't a critical P1 outage, the vendors seem to express zero interest in coming to a resolution for my problem in a timely fashion.
 With currently two of my tools from two different vendors that we are paying good money for, there's so many issues that are affecting the usability of the tool that it's practically worthless in it's current state and we are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a tool that we can't use because of issues with it. I have had to reach out to our CSM multiple times for both companies because the support technician keeps on saying that he will get back to me by the end of the day but two days later I haven't heard anything. I reach out to the CSM, and then magically within a few hours I have a support engineer beating down my digital door asking when we can schedule a phone call. The phone call takes place, I give them what they need, they say that they will get back to me. 2 days goes by with not a peep from them. Re-engage the CSM, and the cycle repeats. 
 With our firewall vendor, it takes an average of 8 days for a resolution, even the most simple of changes. I've brought this up to management multiple times and they say that we don't have the manpower right now to take our firewall duties in house nor do we have the manpower to research and negotiate a contract with a different firewall management company.
 I don't know if it's a staffing shortage or just poor management, but this is incredibly frustrating because I have management at my company asking why these issues aren't resolved yet and I hate shrugging my shoulders and telling them that I'm in a perpetual state of waiting for support to get their act together but it's the truth.

The cert on the on-prem machine is for the OBN.com and half our users don't even have that alias anymore, just the newbusinessname.com as their primary. There are no mailboxes on it, it is just a smtp server at this point or used to create new accounts. Accounts are on-prem by synced to Azure. All email is using Exchange online. First, do I even need this on-prem server? Second, what is the real need of an on-prem server? I am guessing I need it to handle the on-prem accounts email attributes. 
 I am just tired of cert errors and users being prompted for passwords for the old exchange server that just sits there and relays an email every now and then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the best way to go about recreating Python's virtual environment functionality, for a nice fresh Windows install? 
 I'm looking to create a persistent, separate clone of my installation that can handle its own program installs, config, etc without affecting my "clean" install. 
 If it sounds like I want Windows Sandbox, kind of - but I want it persistent. I know I could make a recovery image of my current windows install, but I'm trying to AVOID needing to restore to a previous date, and I want to use both 'environments'. I considered using a VM with an image of my setup, but AFAIK I'd end up with significantly reduced performance. Lastly, I know SOME applications allow you to install to single users, but some of the tools I need required admin. 
 The end goal is to keep my work tools separate, along with their associates config / dependencies / quirks within Windows; while my "main" environment stays clean and proper. 
 I know very little about Docker, but I wondered if I could put all those apps&dependencies into a container, and run them that way?
 Appreciate any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a company laptop that refuses to complete the connection to an updated Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps I can, and the adapter works flawlessly with the same hardware but a blank computer so I'm thinking it must be something about the GP/setup on the domain computers that's preventing it from completing the connection.
 When you press win+k it'll happily find any miracast screen, but it'll try to connect and then fail after about 20 seconds. I tried the troubleshooting steps below but everything seems fine. DXDIAG has it as supported, firewall is setup to allow wireless displays so I'm at a loss. I had a poke with Event Viewer but I'm either not looking in the right place or there's nothing there that indicates an issue.
 I am not the IT team, they're not supporting this and don't really know what miracast is and fed back that 'we don't support 3rd party apps' - this is not a 3rd part app so I'm guessing it's been inadvertently blocked due to something else.
 Oddly, it used to work about 3 years ago, then coming back off lockdown it now does not.
 Steps I followed below:

 it is me. Again.
 I am lost on this one and hope to find some aid.
 For my organization I have setup an IKEv2 VPN on our firewall. And it seemed to work fine, as my coworkers all use it without problems. But a few days ago one of our users approached me and asked when their problem is "finally solved".
 Which problem? I wasn't aware that there even is a problem.
 We had a few major internet outages three weeks ago, but those were resolved by our ISP. But since then, their VPN connections drop regularly, like every 1-2hours. The users thought, that these two problems were somehow related.
 While windows is still telling them, that the VPN Connection is connected, the firewall already decided to drop the connection, probably because of the DeadPeerDetection.
 I don't know who to ask exactly. The firewall is a fortigate. The OS is windows, and the vpn profile is setup in Intune.
 Does anybody have a tip for me? What can cause such a behavior?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'd like to set up centralized Log Management for our Company.
 I'm kind of new to that topic and thus looking for recommendations...
 What we would like, if possible, to collect Logs from:
 On prem (across VPN connected locations):
 - vSphere Clusters
 - Virtual and physical Windows servers (Server 2016+)
 - Virtual and physical Linux servers (Centos7, Rocky Linux)
 - Various Cisco Networking Devices (can forward to e.g. rsyslog)
 - Possible Windows Clients as well?
 Also we're running machines/endpoints/containers on:
 - MS Azure
 - GCP (Google Cloud)
 - OTC (Open Telecom Cloud)
 We're monitoring environments (at least part of them so far, WiP) with Icinga2, so integrations to that may be nice as well.
 So far I took a quick glance at Graylog and ELK, they seem to be the most prominent and obvious choices to look at. But I'm unsure about what of our environment may or may not be supported, so experiences are very welcome.
 Of course, alternatives to the two are as well.
 Thank you! :-)

 For computer users that's easy (already in place) But for non computer users, can an account be created which resembles more of a placeholder or contact?
 I'd really like our Active Directory to be as closely aligned to HRIS as possible but for all the users who don't actually log into a computer this seems not so straightforward.
 Just in case your wondering what some use cases for this crazy ask is....
 I need to add all internal company phone numbers to the global address list and as HRIS is always the source of truth which syncs to AD, it seems logical for the users in the organisation to all appear in AD whether they are a computer user or not.
 Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

 Delay can be anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes.
 Started yesterday for our tenant (UK) and still seems to be on-going.
 Opened a support case with Microsoft who initially advised that it was expected but pushed back mentioning that the delay is not normally this long. 
 Have since been told that a sync object repair has been initiated and to wait 24 hours. 
 Obviously I could turn off the safe links policy in the meantime but would rather not if I can help it.

 Long time lurker on the sub and just had a few questions. Bit of background of myself, currently a helpdesk guy looking to learn networking to move into a network admin role one day. The other day my boss showed me one of our comms room with a rack of live networking equipment. The rack consisted of multiple Aruba switches/controllers and Cisco router stacked on top of each other.
 My question is how would you go about moving all this equipment to another building? Would it simply be a process of unracking all the equipment and cables --> move equipment to another building --> rerack all the equipment and plug in all the cables?
 Another question is how do you guys keep track of which cables are plugged into which device? I've seen network diagrams before but are there diagrams for which cable goes where?
 My guess would be you would need to save the running configurations on all these devices and take pictures of all the cabling.
 Is there anything else you guys would consider?

 Well, windows server 2012 R2 is going EOL this year. The young administrator asked what he should do and well no one really had a good answer. So the young admin must have taken a shot of whiskey and said fuck it because before we knew it he had upgraded the server to 2022! And the old application is still up and running as if nothing changed! 
 The young administrator has earned himself all sorts of street cred with this, honestly, ballsy (maybe reckless) move! Us senior admins and engineers all want to fast track him with more responsibility! 
 I told that story because I don’t see that kind of risk taking by junior admins and honestly I kind of loved it!

 This seems to be the place to ask about EVE-NG. I'm a relatively inexperienced network engineer at a company with a corporate EVE-NG Pro server. Each employee has a username to access it.
 We can see and access each other's labs, but when I try to access a device I get presented with a generic bash prompt. Like it's allowing me to access the emulator without the device image being present. 
 Is there a way for two users to simultaneously work on a lab together? If so, how do we go about it?

I reached out to the security company's helpdesk and they suggested nic teaming 2 of the nics to increase bandwidth. So I added nic 1 and nic 2 to a team along with the settings the help desk suggested. As it's adding the nics, it immediately errors out and states Faulted, not found on both nics, then the redundant nics 3 and 4 drop their connections. When I realized that the security camera server had no network, I immediately called a senior analyst over, and then the server became unresponsive. Since it was unresponsive, we rebooted it. It stayed on the "restarting" screen for apx 5 minutes and then blue-screened. Also, before it became unresponsive, I attempted a windows troubleshoot, and it gave me a "drivers" error. What could have caused the server to freak out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 Trying to get into deeper networking and I've been wanting to get into monitoring/analysis on my network so I'm looking to get some recommendations for this
 I have a couple of scenarios in which I'm trying to monitor/log certain packets being sent from a machine to the internet. 
  I have two PCs sending some data to a specific destination that I want to monitor on and store for analysis at a later date. Data is not encrypted on the wire.
 I have four PCs that sends some data out to the internet that I want to run through a self built TCP proxy to simulate some network conditions without running the proxy on any client.
 I was wondering if any of this is possible straight out of the switch itself via some configuration/port mirroring or if it's possible to build a proxy machine with 2 quad NICs where I could basically bridge 2 ports for data to come in and out before it gets sent to a switch on the network where I could maybe run my proxy on the to monitor and maybe alter data being sent between the NICs.
 Don't know if any of this is possible so any help would be gladly appreciated.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Again, Reddit! I've come to ask for some help with a port forwarding issue I've got going on.
 My edge/gateway device is a Sonicwall TZ215 running SonicOS 6.X. I have an A record as sub.domain.tld on my public DNS that points to this device's WAN interface IP. No issues there.
 My internal host is a Proxmox host running a few web servers. I have a port forwarding rule on the Sonicwall to reach the Proxmox web UI from the internet on HTTPS/TCP port 8006. I have an SSL certificate installed on the Proxmox host for sub.domain.tld. This works perfectly.
 I am now trying to add more web servers to this subdomain on other ports, i.e. https://sub.domain.tld:8443 and http://sub.domain.tld My issue is that I get an ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in my browser for any other port.
 My NAT configuration for the other two web servers that I'm trying to reach matches the NAT configuration for the working web server, the Proxmox host on https://sub.domain.tld:8006, except I created a service object entry for HTTPS/8443. That's the only difference. Still, I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.
 I did a packet monitoring in the Sonicwall appliance to try to isolate the issue and I see the traffic is being dropped to the internal hosts using 80 and 8443, due to "Error code 40 (Enforced firewall rule)".
 There isn't any kind of p@cket trac3r or traffic simulator like ASA has so I'm kind of at a loss. There really aren't any other firewall policies set up since this is a really basic and new configuration, so I can't imagine there'd be anything conflicting.
 The reachable web server and the non-reachable web servers are in the same network zone as defined by the Sonicwall, so it shouldn't be an access issue either.
 I can reach the web servers both internally and on a separate network segment for VPN. 
 I'm stumped, any ideas? Thanks in advance for anyone's input.

 Why do leavers from a non tech background of the role they work in, think it's acceptable in 2023 after they have decided to part ways with the company to demand a leaving "rider", after they handed the notice in?
 head of business and approvers above this allow it when they know it's more work to make a corp device into a personal one. Doing all of the admin alongside to make sure there is no data leak. 
 Then the business describes this year the same old thing we have no budget to invest in new systems, hardware, infrastructure or give bonuses due to the economic world. 
 We work incredibly hard all of us to keep the business running in a stable robust environment to prevent from breaches and other unknowns. I can say that and other IT admins will hopefully respect that. 
 Yet it just feels when you see a leaver asking you about the process of keeping my IT business assets when I leave it's like do we owe you that. It's not yours. It's the businesses. Yes you have a phone number that's the businesses line number. Your iPhone the one that says property of XYZ.com is again a business asset. Also the laptop which is a corp laptop with a corp image on it with corp licensing on it is not yours they still seem to think it's ok to ask for this when they leave like it's a sentimental thing ? 
 Then it comes your manager asks you to make sure they transition you off everything and give them the guidance you should of done this and that. In work hours when you have other actual jobs work related jobs to be doing. 
 Why do businesses not stand up and have a stern stance on this. They have a HR team they have policies and procedures and we chase users for not bringing kit back and holding final salary payment but the odd who dosent want to let go demands they want IT hardware as a parting gift. Opinions?

I realized that ILECs had certain legal obligations, but I didn't realize how different they were organizationally.
 Verizon (when it came to networking services, at least) was essentially split into 3 different companies:
  
Verizon Business (Long-Haul Network Services + CLEC)
 Verizon Telecom (ILEC)
 Verizon Wireless
  
I never quite understand why it was that ILECs were treated like different legal entities, as nothing I read suggested it has to be that way... I'm not sure if all service providers do this, but I know for sure that AT&T does. So for you old timers in telecom who understand a bit of the organizational/legal considerations surrounding networking, can you explain to me why it is that ILEC & non-ILEC services are often split into different companies?

 The team from AT&T says it is extremely difficult for them to look into their own accounting system to find out what they are billing us 🤷‍♀️ We are also transitioning from a managed billing consolidation to internal ap team and need to setup AT&T as a vendor.

 I want to do the process right, but at the same time want to run away from AT&T.

 My internal team is telling me that AT&T owns a lot of last mile circuits for many of our facilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just thought I'd do a PSA for this in case anyone runs into this issue again. We had a request to make some NDI capable cameras work with OBS over our enterprise wireless (this particular SSID had to be created on our older Cisco 8510 due to the APs involved). The cameras themselves I believe are Mevo brand.
 After making some tweaks to get the cameras connected and accessible from the Mevo mobile app (client isolation was turned on in the WLAN config so easy fix), the next issue was that the devices were not being discovered as NDI camera sources in OBS. NDI uses mDNS but I was having issues finding the specific service string so we could add it to the mDNS snooping allow list. Ended up doing a packet capture to find it: 
 _ndi._tcp.local.
 Simple enough but even searching this in Google now that I know the answer didn't bring in a lot of results so I wanted to post this and hopefully it is helpful to someone in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had an interesting discussion with a co-worker today and told him how I was using ChatGPT to help me write/improve some powershell code. He said he would feel a little weird using it for work...like it's not his work. I said, "no...just another tool in the arsenal. How long have you been using StackOverflow or google to copy code?" You have to know code to tell it what to do so it's not like some dude off the street can explain how to create a complex function in powershell. 
 Anyway, how many other sysadmins have been actively using ChatGPT? What have you primarily used it for at work? And do any of your coworkers know? I'm a bit reluctant to even mention it to anyone else after that conversation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a building with 5 stacks of Cisco C9200L switches. Across all of those I have one VLAN which is our AV VLAN with about 180 devices of various types of AV equipment from Teams Rooms to Dante microphones/speakers, amplifiers, control systems and Crestron NVX encoders/decoders. Everything works perfectly fine. 
 I’m trying to add a new audio conferencing solution that needs to connect to some cameras using ONVIF for control. The main system sends out a discovery to the network to find any cameras. The cameras can also be manually added but then after populating the details it sends an ONVIF discovery probe to get all the details of the device. These processes don’t work at all on the AV network. If I change the addresses of these devices to any other subnet it works. 
 My assumption is that there’s too much traffic flying around on that network and the messages are getting blocked somehow. I’m at a loss as to how to rectify it though. All the stacks have 10gig uplinks with no saturation, igmp snooping configured, igmp querier set to collapsed core Nexus. Any ideas what I might be missing?
 Edit: I got it. It was an issue with MTU and jumbo frames.

At the minute I've created a prefix-list/route-map permitting the routes individually, but obviously this isn't hugely scale-able going forward.
 I saw a blog post that mentioned doing this with the next-hop option in a prefix list:
 ip prefix-list STATIC-NEXT-HOP seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 match ip next-hop 10.27.4.1 
 but I can't actually find this as a valid Cisco command anywhere, and even if it is it isn't available on my C9000.
 Seems there must be a simple way to do this but I can't figure it out right now!
 I also tried an access list with "permit ip any host 10.27.4.1 " and feeding this into a route-map but that didn't play along either.

 Long time lurker here. For the past 2 years I set up my own company and I have been working as a B2B contractor as a network engineer. This week, my main and only customer told me that they will no longer be requiring my services -- the (in)famous pink slip (or email, in this case).
 Won't get into too much detail in order to not breach the NDA, but it's one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. I was handling several DC's for them, and they decide they no longer need those DC/branch offices. They will be moving all their apps to the cloud, and all their personnel back to their HQ. They'll only have a skeleton crew at the locations which I manage, so that makes my role rather redundant. 
 The reason I opened this thread is not to complain ( I'm single, no obligations, no rent, and I have several certs, including CCNP Enterprise and JNCIS-SP), but I'm curious what is the status of remote work where you're currently at ?
 This contract was 100% remote. Since I got the news this week, I think applied to some 200 jobs already, and while I found some very interesting ones which were a good fit, and which paid even better than my current contract. However all of them required either hybrid or on-site presence. 
 Since the pandemic ended, what was the policy in your company in regards to remote/office hours ? And what do you think will be the future of remote work, especially for us ICT folks ? 
 Also, if you happen to know anyone looking for a 100% remote based network engineer, don't hesitate to reach out to me in private.

 We thought the user got the Administrator account password and was adding themselves to the Administrators group. That might not be the case here. 
 The user really isn’t computer savvy. They also haven’t made any changes ever to the system while having Administrator privileges. 
 We did change the Administrator password on that system a few weeks ago. We haven’t touched the system since. It seemed like maybe it was indeed the user making the group change somehow because it stopped for a while. Today, their account popped back into the Administrators group. There is no record of the Administrator account being logged into or used in order to make the group change. They are just magically in the Administrators group again. 
 We originally thought it was something related to the original sysprep of the system because they would get added to the Administrators group at almost every login. That doesn’t seem to be case here since it stopped for a while. We’re thinking it might be some system service or an application they launch that is adding them to the group?
 Any ideas on how to trace this? We’re already using Event Viewer to track the group change being made and confirmed in the GUI that they are indeed in the Administrators group.
 Any other ideas how this is occurring?

 I was asked to create a NAT and firewall rule set from an external IP to a 3rd party controlled server dead smack in the middle of an important internal subnet.
 I have zero reason to believe anyone has set up comprehensive local device firewalls on the other devices in this subnet.
 I pitched the idea that they either review their individual firewalls, or create a DMZ for their new server, and only allow inside access to the items the 3rd party box 'needs'.
 NOPE! We're going to blast a goddamned hole in the perimeter with no further thought given. I have the proof in email that this is the choice that was made.
 Not only would I like to tell them to make these awful configs themselves, I'd like to tell them I won't help them when they get owned, and they should request someone else.
 What is the point in doing a job badly, and dutifully taking part in bad practices? I can get paid to do shit work in a thousand other places where nobody is experienced or conscientious enough to notice or care. I tried for something better, and now am subject to bad choices by unqualified high ranking functionaries.
 The second something goes wrong, I'm checking into the E.R. with a fatal case of 'I Told You So', and they can find another technician to bail them out.

 Restart, is the only way to reset and start fresh.

Is there generality/commonality constraints or variables that I can use to educate the pseudo Network person on why they are not getting full ISP bandwidth and why it is inconsistent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll share as much detail as possible as this problem hasn't waivered. Keep in mind this is my first step up from IT specialist to sys admin so bear with me OGs.
 We are operating on a 2016 Windows Server and this holds all of our drives. The business is about 100 people. In November, I installed the .NET Framework 4.8(KB5020614) and the Update for Windows Server 2016(KB5019964). I have had non-stop issues with connectivity to the drives ever since. The errors string from "local device name is already in use," to "Target name is incorrect."
 I have found limited success in doing ipconfig/release-renew-flushdns. It's usually a 50-50 chance that the issue resolves after that. If I use the IP address to the server in the file explorer address bar, it immediately pulls up; its the complete opposite when I try to call it by its name \\server1\. I've checked the DNS and DHCP to see if they're properly communicating and there seems to be nothing wrong(not ruling them out).
 As recent as yesterday, I have started to force our user computers to use a different IP through the IPv4 in adapter options. For instance, I'll make 192.168.8.113 go to 192.168.8.204. I have found complete success with this and the most odd part is I can set the user machine back to automatically grabbing an IP address which will revert it to 192.168.8.113 and it instantly works. 
 It seems like I'm forcing the previous session to end and renewing the lease on the DHCP ??? I don't know but I'm open to all suggestions as my boss(the owner) grows in irritation. 
 Thanks ahead of time.

 Im having several discussion with both Cisco, OT vendors and customers regarding the best way to start such projects. Some says that SPAN/RSPAN into Micosoft Defender for IoT or equivalent product is sufficient, others say that SPAN will create problems and one must get Cisco cybervision and switches with sensors.
 Anyone have experience or some advise on what to keep in mind in different scenarios? I know that the Cisco solution works fine, but in big networks it will get really expensive.

 Something that i want to fix. I need to determine which users are utilising BYOD and how they are doing it to work out a plan of action.
 We use O365 and have DUO+Okta.
 Ideally, i would like a report of some description that shows logins from non-corporate devices.
 DUO reports do not give me the hostname of the device the user is logging in from, and i dont believe Azure logins do either. 
 In an ideal world i would just turn on the posture settings of DUO and see who screams, but that isnt going to go down well.
 I need to demonstrate the scale of this to upper management so they realise how many people do this and realise the exposure we have with data on personal devices etc etc. 
 Can anyone think of a good way to determine which devices logins to O365/DUO/Okta are coming from?
 Was thinking whether the install log from O365 apps gives telemetry of the device its installed on?

 We have here a classic on-prem Environement with a hyper-V cluster and mainly Windows Servers in Production. Now we have a new system that will run "dockerized", that environement is a composition of 7-8 containers that run together to deliver that service (mysql, redis, nginx and some other images).
 How do you deal with that "in general" regarding the management of such stuff?
 Do you create a bunch of linux hosts virtualised inside hyper-V and manage them with some container orchestrator (any tips - can be commercially backed and cost something)? So, something like a virtualized cluster?
 Do you build something completely "aside" like a bunch of synlogy nas with docker support? or even a complete new hardware cluster?
 Using windows servers for docker stuff does not make sense imho. 
 Thanks for any recommendation :)

 I tried out meshcentral and it looks great but the developer may stop working on it.
 I need something very easy to use like teamviewer but probably more affordable and they seeem like the used car salesman of remote support.
 I definitely need multi monitor support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so while typing what was going to be the original post this has started working, but for no apparent reason. This has now gone from a request for help to a quest of understanding.
 So a while ago I was doing some fiddling with a client Synology, had created a new backup folder, unmapped the old one, attempted to remap the new one. "Invalid Password". Ok sure, that happens sometimes, thing is I didn't actually need the drive to be mapped as the backup software (backup assist) could see the location and access it with the given details so I figured it'd be fine. Decided to fix mapping the drive after the next scheduled reboot.
 Everything was not fine, turns out that despite being able to see and access the NAS, when attempting to actually perform the backup task it would fail as "unable to access the network location". Keep in mind, all I have done is make a new 2023 subfolder in the backup folder (we're MSP, they like it that way) and try to map it back after removing the 2022 folder.
 So I make a new user, try to map it with that, nope, same thing. Despite being able to log into the device with these same creds that Windows doesn't like.
 After that I restart things, bash my head against the wall a bit, find some other people who had similar problems that came about as the result of a setting change (none of mine have, double and triple checked), so I come here, begin writing my post, and mid way through I decide to try to map it one more time.
 It fucking works.
 And I haven't even done anything. I didn't even have to type the details in, it just immediately worked and mapped it like there'd never even been a problem.

 There's an trainee installer role I've been interested in but they don't offer CCNA certification, only the CNCI. 
 I ask because taking CCNA will come out of my own pocket and if a Network Installer firm doesnt specifcally look for it and says its not needed then I wouldn't take it. I know that CCNA is one of if not the most popular IT course so it shocks me that a trainee position in a network role doesn't offer it as part of their programme.

 we have a big problem at our RDS System and our Print Server.
 I need more time to analyze it but i dont want the users to always call it so we can restart the print spooler.
 So here is my plan:
 i activated the log funtion in " Get-WinEvent Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational ". If the problem occours we can see it in the Event-ID 821 (which gets created everytime a print happens on the client that tells you the status. if its status 0x0 everything worked, if its not 0x0 there was a problem. In our case we always get the status code 0x6BA: example: https://imgur.com/a/kAOQJf3
 So i want an workaround for our endusers that automaticly checks if there is something different than Status: 0x0 in the 821 Event.
 The Question is how to do it right? I can create an trigger in the taskscheduluer for event 821 but keep in mind that in event 821 the successfully and failure prints are listed. Is there a way with custom XML-Filtering? 
 Can someone give me a tipp or example for the right direction?
 ​
 Thanks!

 Opinions of sharepoint aside, one of the biggest problems I have right now is shit data in / shit data out. Does anyone know of a good, reliable way to deduplicate data either in Box or in sharepoint?
 This box environment is an unholy mess and despite asking repeatedly the various leads have somehow not gotten around to cleansing their own data - meaning there are duplicated folders all over the damn place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a wildcard DNS entry for a couple of our domains. On one of them we are seeing an massive amount of traffic toward non-existing subdomains. We had this the first time in the beginning of February with about 2,5 million request over 4 days. Annoying but not something our webserver could not handle. Did an abuse report to Azure as it was an IP address in their space. 
 Yesterday at 1am a new scan started, again from a Azure IP address. Did a new abuse report but after 750000 request I had enough and blocked the IP address around 2pm, to my surprise the second I blocked te IP address the pattern moved from 1 IP address to random IP addresses from all over the world. At this moment I have more than 19000 IP addresses. The rate of requests has slowed down but still we see around 15000 requests an hour. 
 Anybody experienced this?
 My idea is removing the wildcard entry and just add the necessary subdomains to our DNS (would be around 70-100), my co-worker however things it is useless.

 Also yes I've got a break glass account with multiple 2FA methods. Don't like having an account without MFA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the early stages of getting started with Ansible for some network automation. Currently, use cases are small for now (update helper-addresses, NTP servers etc) but I expect to go further down the rabbit hole and maybe leverage it for full site deployments.
 Anyway, one of the things that is being discussed is integration with Jenkins CI/CD. As a pure network engineer, I honestly have no idea how Jenkins works and what is involved with it and why it would be beneficial to us but none the less I will need to research it.
 So first question, is there any resource out there (book, blog, youtube etc) that gives some good insight into Jenkins purely from a network perspective? 
 And finally, is Ansible Tower considered CI/CD? Ansible Tower to me seems just like a GUI for pushing playbooks which would obviously make it more user friendly for someone who want to push a playbook but not have to write the code in Ansible. Example, would be that I create a bunch of playbooks and someone else who is not fully up to speed, could just come along, modify the variables to the relevant devices, and then push it out. Is this what Jenkins tries to achieve?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning all,
 Work for a CSP and we have an Excel sheet that we copy + paste each month to record backups for customers, each backup type (i.e. offsite or onsite) and what we back up (physical server, VM's). To record success/failure - each cell has a tick box. We get emails to a specific shared mailbox for the backups, so the process of recording the backups is to check the folder for a given client, tick if the expected backup succeeded, go on to the next (and of course if there isn't a tick, investigate why).
 Problem being that it's pretty slow to load several thousand tickboxes and as soon as we create a new backup/new customer it completely drags it down. We create a new document every month. It's been this way for a few years but given the recording of backups takes 30 minutes a day and feels like a early 2000's solution - feeling there's got to be a better way.
 What're you doing to record your backups?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company has gone fully remote over the last few years and might be looking at terminating a remote employee. We are a fairly small company and to be honest, haven't had to fire any once since we have been full remote. I still need to work out the details with HR, but I got the impression this will be over a teams call. Our business works with a lot of customer data that this individual has access to, and want to cut that access almost instantly after the call. Here is a bit about our environment:
 User has a laptop that is Intune enrolled. We have our DCs in Azure and use a lot of the typical MS services such as teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.. This particular user has some of our customer files SharePoint doc libraries synced with OneDrive to his local machine.
 If while we are on the call, his password is changed, SharePoint and files access removed, doesnt this take some time to sync? I believe the last time I removed some ones Azure files access, they had it for several more hours. Is this the same for Sharepoint? We do have "Automate" installed on his machine, so I could force a reboot, but if he is not on the VPN at the time, the password might not sync and still be cached. I did some research and saw there is a registry item that can be changed.
 Although I could wipe the machine with Intune, I do want to be able to go through the machine and make sure he does not have local files that need moved to a project directory on the network. 
 Will a password change instantly cut his access on his phone as well, or do I need to revoke those tokens as well?
 I would appreciate any suggestions to make this as streamlined as possible, its not something we are particularly excited about having to do, but they are leaving us no choice.

 Is it possible to have a single code for the two tabs that are launching simultaneously or is this just the way it works?

 I need a way to analyse if OS packages (OEL/RHEL/Ubuntu/Debian) are vulnerable to a CVE's. Most vendors have an oval file that describes "package with version lower than XXX is vunrable".
 I have an ansible playbook that gathers all the packages and writes them to a server (a file per host)
 I know there are a lot of tools and ways to see if a system in vulnerable to an CVE (oscap/vuls...). But nothing that is actually without installation of the tool on the server itself.
 So I was wondering if there are tools/scripts that just have a parser of OVAL with an input "a package or a package list"
 something like
 cvereport.py -i server_packages.list -o oval file.
 I know oscap-ssh exist and that might be a solution. Vuls also looks like it is agentless but I want to avoid having "another inventory to maintain" (ansible and vuls)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this may be a stupid question and maybe I'm reading too much into it, but here's where I'm unsure:
 I deal with Cybersecurity Insurance Questionnaires for our clients. A lot of times it'll ask if server databases are encrypted at-rest, and from my understanding and from what tools we use, this is basically asking "Is Bitlocker enabled on server data disks?" and the answer is typically No.
 However now I have this question for a client who's servers are all Azure VMs. These do not have Azure Disk Encryption enabled, which from my (potentially limited) understanding, means Bitlocker is not enabled on the virtual disk. However, Azure VMs by default live on Microsoft's data centers, and the physical disks in those data centers have server-side encryption (SSE) 
 So my question is... does this count for at-rest encryption as far as this cybersecurity questionnaire is concerned? Because from my (again, probably limited) understanding, at-rest encryption is intended to protect against someone getting access to the physical disk, and sure this would prevent it if someone broke into the Microsoft data center and somehow stole the disk this VM lived on so that would seem to make the answer to the question "Yes" in the most technical sense. But if someone gained access to the Azure environment & stole the VHD file, then Bitlocker isn't enabled on that file and could presumably read all the contents then it's like... was at-rest encryption really even on? Is at-rest encryption explicitly a protection against physical data breaches? Or should at-rest encryption include VM disk encryption when the server in question is a VM?
 Or maybe I'm thinking too hard about this?

 We just started to receive a few calls from users informing us, that some Microsoft Apps on iOS seem to be stuck on updating.
 Looks like they are being offloaded by iOS, guessing by settings > general > iphone storage, but to my suprise, the offloading setting isn't even accessible/visible under settings > app store > app offloading.
 Unfortunately, those devices are DEP and MDM enabled AND the Company Portal App (Intune) is also offloaded, so those other apps are never gonna get updated due to "broken" devices. 
 Best workaround is to fully reinstall the device, which is cumbersome.
 ​
 Does anyone have a clue on how to prevent or undo this? I couldn't find an MDM switch for this Intune or on the web.

 Now, we've seen issues where the signature can throw off the RDP file sometimes so we edited the file in notepad and removed both the "signscope:s:" and "signature:s:" values, this allowed it to work, obviously this bypasses the whole "digitally signed" part of the file.
 We checked the usual before this, ensuring all the certificates were valid etc. (they were) and no weird updates had been applied to clients or the relevant servers (they hadn't) so we deployed this file to affected users.
 However, we then got a report from another customer with the same issue, then a third reported the issue. Our initial thought being some sort of CA issue, but two of these customers used Sectigo, the other was R5/GlobalSign so that ruled that idea out.
 We couldn't find a reason for this so eventually just had to remove those two lines from the files and it seemed to resolve the issue. A cursory glance around the Internet only really flagged this issue when using self signed certs, we aren't.
 Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! At the moment we have only seen this at 3 (maybe 4) customers but obviously don't want to see this get more widespread!
 As an additional point, the RDP file "breaks" regardless of where it's used from, so it doesn't look to be the originating network that's the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been experiencing a weird issue with my production dell L3 router S6000-ON. Once a week or soall of its port-channel members ungroup and then immediately group back up (I have lacp long-timeout set). I turned on RSTP and LACP debug events but it essentially just logs the fact that those ports ungrouped and not the reason why they did it in the first place. No alarms or other environmental thresholds were reached. I'm trying to find some kind of event or traffic burst in my network to explain these events but it is difficult. I'm trying to think of ideas of what I could check to figure this one out.
 I changed the firmware from the older to the latest but it didn't seem to have any effect.
 ​
 I noticed some possible causality on one of my access switches connected to the router. I was migrating my router from old hardware to new and the issue of port-channel flapping moved to the new after moving this particular access switch (although I can't be sure). I noticed that port-channel for that switch has counter for "giants", but I'm not sure if that can have any affect on the switch itself (giants = packets that are greater than the MTU size).

 On the router itself, I noticed dozens of connections from our internal workstations on the LAN, going to handfuls of the same destination IP addresses located at various Akamai CDNs on port 443. The issue had gotten so bad, that I had to block the offending connections at the router level just to stop it from causing all of this packet loss, because it was maxing out our internet connection, and our Mikrotik CCR1036 router couldn't handle it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Are there any guides for how to administer FIDO physical security keys like Yubikeys for an entire team/organization?
 The biggest hurdle I would expect to see is a user losing their key. I don't understand how organizations which require all users have physical keys handle this on an administrative level, and I am struggling to find any real world examples/best practice documentation on it. 
 I understand for any account fully controlled by your organization (such as Microsoft 365) that a lost key can be handled from an administrative portal. But how do you handle a lost or broken key on accounts that you do not have full administrative control over, such as a social media account? If you require your staff to register a backup key, does that not create other issues (my knee-jerk reaction is end users would end up carrying the backup with them so they can always have it to register both at once, or would forget to bring in the backup key so it never gets registered, both of which defeats the purpose of the backup key) or do you require that the IT department register additional keys on MFA setup?
 Am I overlooking something obvious, or is this just something that sysadmins just deal with? It would seem to me that the best way of solving this would be if a YubiKey/similar product could be "paired" so that one key could register both itself and a cold backup key that is stored elsewhere (held by IT in a corporate use case) without having to carry both.
 Thank you for any insight,

 (I have kind of the same issues as mentioned in this thread.) 
 I am working with ansible automation towards different cisco switches in my company and I have specific issue with VTY lines on IOS-XE 17.x 
 So on 17.03.04(9600) it looks like this: 
 9600(config)#line vty ? <0-97> First Line number 9600#show run | incl line vty line vty 0 4 line vty 5 15 
 And on 17.06.04(9300) it looks like this: 
 9300(config)#line vty ? <0-98> First Line number 9300#show run | incl line vty line vty 0 4 line vty 5 15 line vty 16 31 
 And that in itself is okey(pretty f'ing annoying tho), but the problem is when i try to remove excessive lines.
 On the 9600 it's no problem, but on the 9300 i get this error:
 % Can't delete last 32 VTY lines 
 Anyone has experience with this, and what did you do to solve it?

I put easy in quotation marks , because yeah the subject matter is kind of difficult, but at least there's plenty of resources out there. LTE does not have nearly the amount of learning resources. 
 We just bought some licensed LTE spectrum , so our CBRS LTE will now be accompanied by real licensed LTE. 
 Id really like to know how all of this stuff gets implemented. Ever since I started here back in August of last year, I've been trying to find some reading material or some sort of course on this stuff but not really sure where to start.
 Anyone here know LTE pretty well? If so, what resources did you use to develop your proficiency on the topic?

All this is working fine, but my question is: is it possible that if my server A is down, my DFSR switches to my server B, because when I stop my server A, server B does not take over. I have enabled sharing on the replicated folder on Server B, the path is correct, but when I click on the folder in question from a client machine, it cannot access it. There is no problem with NTFS permissions or GPOs, I am testing on a dedicated ESXi. Server A has the role of ADDS, DNS, DFS and DFSR. Server B has the role ADDS, DNS, DFSR.

One of our customers had a previous RDS setup where some process/software on the backend was terminating any Chrome sessions when a user disconnected their RDS session, in order to free up the memory/CPU cycles. Been doing some light searching around this today and have not seen any good solutions so far. 
 Anyone have a way to do this with native tools? Perhaps something along the lines of using PS to output disconnected sessions on each session host, then outputting the processes each session has, looking for chrome.exe?

 Any way on to the issue: my ssid is similar to xxxxxHome. After not doing the modem reset, I got to a tech. They said that any ssid that contains the word “home” causes issues. Must be a new feature, because the ssid hasn’t changed in years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so I have a real strange one. Windows 11 (why did I upgrade)?? Outlook 365 (NEWEST VERSION) after about 4 hours becomes unresponsive and when restarting the application it will get stuck on LOADING PROFILE. Like all good sysadmins I did my google searching forever on this and there is not one thing (rebuild profile, reinstall Office, repair OST, rebuild OST, turn off bad add-ins that do nothing but slow you down, reset the navpane, everything) that hasn't worked. The ONLY thing that works is once it gets into that state, a quick reboot fixes it for another 4 hours. I keep saying 4 hours because it's been close to clockwork when it happens 4-5 hours later.
 Talk about an annoying piece of crap. We all can have our rants on crappy MSFT software updates and programming. However, I have had a few other users with the new version of Outlook with similar issues, but the beforementioned methods have worked (but it eats up precious time none of us have). The difference with my users is they are all Windows 10, and I was the idiot that was smart enough to upgrade to Windows 11.
 Any thoughts? Other than the IT guy is an idiot (I hate that I can't even figure out my own stupid issue)? Sure, I can drag MSFT into it (and probably will if I can't get it figured out) but I thought I would turn to the much smarter guys first.
 Edit 1: Outlook will still hang even with an attempt to load in Safe Mode...
 Edit 2: I have deleted fully all OST's and rebuilt from the server twice now, not that either..

 Happening across many companies and different Windows servers from 2012 R2 to 2019.

 The cert on the RD Gateway is fine but the certs are all issued by Sectigo so perhaps that's the issue.

 Quick fix is to backup the RDP file and remove the signing details from the end.

 I'm running 3rd software on Windows Server 2016 on VMWare.
 AFAIK , The idea behind the so-called 'best-practice' of 1.5x RAM has its roots in the 1990's when RAM was very expensive. 
 There is a lot of advice out there talking about setting the size to 1.5 or 2 times the size of the memory that is installed.

 To this extent i would love some feedback on current (2022/2023) ressources / implementation guides or even books on this subject. 
 Most of what i find is either 2+ years old or mainly general descriptions.

 What I simply need is some (very unscientific) numbers for what peers are using for your remote worker / remote access solutions, that I can then just reference in a "top 5" or so solutions I can dig a little deeper in some further comparative research.
 Can people just post the solution they use, or upvote if someone has already posted the same solution.

After a successful installation of the latest CU (Feb 23, KB5022838) that includes a Kerberos fix on DC1, I encountered the error (Event ID 37: The Key Distribution Center (KDC) encountered a ticket that did not contain information about the account that requested the ticket while processing a request for another ticket).
 Updating DC2 to the same CU did not resolve the problem.
 Additionally, the printers shares are broken, and the main issue, an oldy software that uses SMB1 on two servers (2008 and 2003)- shares are not accessible by PC name anymore, only by IP. SMB1 is disabled on the rest of the servers and PCs in the domain.
 any tips?
 i guess error might dissaper after 5 days with renew kerberos tickets but the rest.

 A month ago i switched out my firewall at home to a box running OPNSense. At that time i also started using VLANs. The plan was to move everything out from default LAN and i started moving some servers to VLAN 100 (MGMT) (they were already joined in the AD at that point).

I’m keen on setting up a VLAN for my CCTV at home to minimise chances of my CCTV being hacked, as well as reducing the chances of other devices in my home network getting their security compromised.
 How do I go about doing this and does it cost a lot to setup a VLAN for my home CCTV? It would be great if I could have an idea of the exact equipment I need to purchase as well as a cost breakdown. Further, is it really necessary to have a VLAN set up to prevent an occurrence of hacking in a home network?
 I don’t have much technical knowledge in this aspect so a layman explanation would be very much appreciated. Thank you!

 I'll try to keep it as short as possible and go straight to the point:
  
Within our company we all make use of Office365.
 We make use of a Hybrid Azure AD system.
 One particular colleague has the issue that he keeps losing connection to the Exchange server within Outlook. This always happens after 1 or 2 hours of working.
 All other applications keep working fine.
 He closes Outlook to restart it again, yet Outlook won't start anymore then.
 He has to reboot his laptop to make it work again, only to have the same problem occur after 1 or 2 hours again.
  
I'm running into a dead end what I can try here, this is what I've tried so far:
  
Quick repair of Office in Control Panel
 Online repair of Office in Control Panel
 Reinstalling Office
 Enabled Wireless Radio Control within BIOS (read somewhere that enabling this could help with the issue, unfortunately it didn't).
 Reset the user's password through www.office.com, while connected directly on our company network (to make sure the sync between Azure AD and our on premise AD is done correctly, as this has been an issue sometimes in the past).
 Removed the Outlook profile and made a new profile.
 Probably countless other things that I can't think of right now.
  
Does anyone know what else I can try? It's getting really annoying, especially for the end user.

 Thanks a lot for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit, but I have a question. I currently have a load balancer and two on-premises web servers. I recently added a web server on the cloud and I want the load balancer to include this server in its configuration. Do I need to establish a VPN between the two on-premises servers and AWS to make this possible? is there any better way to do so? is it a bad design ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slightly strange request....\
 I've been tasked with setting up temporary wifi and internet for a building. There are 3 floors and each floor is c. 80m x 50m. The floors are largely open - no walls, just empty space. We do not have access to the building's internet and we may (or may not) have access to normal consumer-level electricity supply.
 It just needs to be be there for a couple of weeks. 50 wifi temperature sensors will beplaced on each floor and will connect to the wifi and transmit their small amount of temperature data to a cloud service.
 I'm thinking we will likely need three 4G mobile internet routers (one per floor) and then a wifi access point (or more than one) for each floor. And possibly a UPS for each floor to supply the power to them - although hoping that electricity will be possible.
 No floor-to-floor cabling will be allowed and only minimal, exposed cabling allowed on each floor.
 So I guess my questions are chiefly:
  
Will one WAP per floor be able to deal with 50 low-data devices and the 80mx50m area?
 If so (or if not) what devices would you recommend
 Anything else I ought to be thinking about?
  
Thx

 a consultant is strongly proposing us to use the router in object to substitute old Cisco Asr1002 as BNG, and to be used to terminate our geographical links between our datacenters where VPLS / VXLAN / EVPN are concentrated to make DCI 
 Do you have experience with this router? Aside from the china vs US competition, its cost/hw_specs is quite unbeliavable, and when something is too good to be true, usually something is hiding...

 I have an interesting problem. We are a small ISP/MSP and our upstream provider told us that users from two of our /24 IP ranges send very excessive DNS queries asking for the IP address of a.root-servers.net (their engineer told me that there were times when it surpassed google by a significant margin, even distorting their statistics for site queries).
 Now I am wondering what could even cause this; especially as there is very little overlap in infrastructure between the two IP ranges (and one of the ranges have a significant infra overlap with other unafected ranges)? Have any of you seen anything similar ever? Could it be a bug caused by a auto update of a common CPE brand?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I belong to a school that allowed me to create my username, which is also my email address, and password from the web. No in-person on-boarding. 
 Those credentials (SSO) allow me to sign into macs and windows computers, not only the one in my desk but also any public terminals (library), albeit my documents only stay on my desktop Mac (they don’t sync to any Mac I log into). 
 Staff can bring their own devices and are able to use their SSO to access MS office, PeopleSoft (student information system), VPN, Adobe, DocuSign, Canvas, etc, all of which are downloaded directly from the developers or are web-based. Mixing personal documents with work documents isn't discouraged because the important stuff (student records, financial stuff) can only be accessed on campus with school WiFi or a VPN for remote work.
 It seems only on-campus Macs and PCs are managed with MDM. If an employee prefers to not use their own computer for work, they can be issued an on-campus computer, in which software is downloaded through a program. 
 What is the technical description for this type of system? How can one replicate this for their own organization? 
 Is it easier to use cloud based products and manage a SSO instead of deploying and managing devices?

 We are about to migrate some customers to azure ad joined devices. They are all domain joined right now. We would love to keep the user data / settings and move it to the new azure ad joined profile on the device. It would also be great to migrate the installed printers to the new profile. How would you guys handle this?
 Edit: As some extra information, the reason why I am asking is. This company has users who feel very special, entitled, we already have to do some 1 on 1 sessions to make sure everything is allright. So we will touch all the devices, but some of them are not very IT knowledgeable and would freak out because there printer is not working or something is wrong with their device
 I have no issue in using third party tooling if it would make life easier for the users...

We have recently shifted a portion of our business to use the cloud service to replace the previous telephone system but have noticed significant latency issues especially at the start of calls. My gut feeling says as the call session initiates with the "Global SIP Network" as they call it, it gets rerouted quite a bit which slows it down. I'd just like to know if anyone else has had subpar performance for Dialpad in Aus or NZ?
 Note) Did an Ookla speed test with an end user today reporting issues and they 278 down 114 up with 4ms to server, so I'm thinking very unlikely an issue on our side.

The CEO, CIO and President have built a habit of calling our help desk techs directly (or emailing / chatting in Teams), anytime they need IT assistance (even non-emergency ones). They have never submitted a ticket, which is what we want them to do. But they won't listen, no matter how kindly we ask.
 their secretaries typically will submit tickets for them. But that rarely happens since they don't go to their secretaries first when something goes wrong.
 Part of us is like, "eh, they are at the top of the pyramid.. whatever.. just help them then open a ticket for them and move on." Another part of us is like "no, they need to follow IT policy like everyone else!"
 Just curious if this is an issue for the companies you work for? And how strongly you enforce the "open a ticket before I can help you" policy with the "higher-ups?"

 just hoping for some assistance. 
 It's a bit of a noob question, but im struggling to understand and implement 802.1x auth on my office's wifi.
 I've created an nps server, added the Meraki AP's, added the secret to the AP's, and configured meraki to go to the NPS server. But my sticking point is installing and correcty configuring the certificate my boss gave me for the task.
 I've had very little to do with certs and whilst I understand the concept of pki I don't understand how to implement in practice.
 Like I put the ssl cert in the personal store on the server and the 802.1x policy then let me choose it as the certificate to authenticate against. But then what part do i need to add to a users computer, and how do i get that out to them?
 I've just become massivley confused and would love if someone point me in the correct direction.

I have tried a couple of things such as re-plugging the HDD, resetting the BIOS, performing System Restore, Booting into Safe Mode but as you guess it, everything failed. The error persists, now I'm down to the last resort which is to reinstall windows but before going thru that, I was wondering if there is any other things I could try?
 Edit: I have also tried running chkdsk /f /r and sfc /scannow but both didn't help much. The chkdsk didn't find any bad sector. The disk have 4 partition and everything is correctly labelled such as C: Windows, D: New Volume, and also 1 Recovery partition and another system reserved partition. It seems like it does detect the HDD but couldn't access the boot sector? I might be getting the wrong idea but that is what I understand.
 Edit 2: I decided to just reset the PC since I don't have all day and user need it fast. I thank you for the suggestions that everyone gave me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new environment with poor documentation, I think past sysadmins have been lazy and removed inheritance deep on file shares. I would like to run a scan from the file servers to show me any folder that deviates from the parent folder on permissions. This way I can validate its business purpose, give it a proper security group and put users back into it. Then I can update new hire request forms to ensure new employees have the right permissions from the start.
 Any program or script to do this, or is there a better way then just nuking from the top and hoping I do not expose confidential info?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 4 months ago I enrolled to Junior Network Administrator job because the previous Network Admin left. Before that I used to fix network issues on a basic level remotely. I was chosen because I was very interested in networking, internet and I would study at home while others wouldn't. I have learned to configure switches like Alcatel, HP, 3Com, Nortel, Dlink, Dell, Netgear on a basic level. Vlans, port isolation, loop protection, troubleshooting why it wouldn't work. We have only mikrotik dude to monitor entire network. We use only mikrotiks.What would be the best network monitoring software to monitor network for free? I can't take care of my network if I can't see what's going on in it properly. The dude only displays bandwith after 24hrs. Service up, down with notification to telegram is setup so we can react quickly. Zabbix + grafana, prometheus + grafana?How to take care of network properly? What to monitor? What are free gpon monitoring tools? Zabbix seem to increase cpu load of gpon. I have basic understanding but I want to get better and take care of my network. I have to take care of a few data rooms, switches, security, I need to see what's going on my network in switches, gpon, I want to get better at this. I was working for free to get any experience previously just to get hired somewhere. I found my favorite thing. Networking. When I like this, I have motivation. Could you help me? I need good material how to take care of network properly. Thanks. I'm not alone there's a Senior Network Admin that takes care of servers, the work load is huge, when to learn? :) I want to help him. I'll put less stress on him by taking care of my side of network. Help me a bit. Thanks! I feel like CCNA + Mikrotik Courses would be best atm. Which I'm going for.

 The ceiling is gyprock, then there's a ceiling cavity roughly 1-1.5 metres high, with manhole access, then a concrete ceiling above that.

 There are existing cables run in the cavity - lighting, data, AV etc., as well as HVAC ducting
 There are some existing vertical metal rods, and some of the cables are cable tied to those - however, in general, most of those are loose, and there aren't that many rods.
 My question is - if you were running new CAT6A cabling in this space - would you put the cables in some kind of conduit? Or how else would you keep them supported and tidy, and also in case you wanted to change them later? (I seem to remember something vaguely about supporting them in bundles, but can't find the reference).
 Or would you just loose lay the cable on the gyprock ceiling itself?
 Or what other techniques do people use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello networking !
 I have a quick question for any pro installers out there. 
 I'm in the process of commissioning my new recording studio and I have my friends teenage son who's interested in systems integration/audio production (kids these days) on site after school to help out with testing and to learn some wiring skills. 
 I'm teaching him to terminate RJ45's and having him try to make some short ethernet cables (the first of which have been deliciously atrocious) and I wanted to give him a sense of what would be expected in a pro environment in terms of skills.
 I'd categorize my personal networking install level as apprentice+, this will be my third studio I've wired and with various other projects I'd say that I've terminated maybe 600-700 cables in my "career". I had to terminate about 60 cables for this one and I messed up 2. 
 From the audio wiring perspective I've probably terminated 6k balanced channels and I'll mess up maybe 1 in 150ish. 
 My question is what the error rate would be for a professional installer, I'm guessing it would be 1 in 200ish but frankly I don't have a clue. 
 Any edification would be much appreciated, also would be curious as to how long it took any of you to learn this skill.

 I work full-time IT at a non-profit organization and there really isn't a ton of work to do. I work under an IT director and we're just a 2 man department.
 My boss is a total workaholic and it's hard to get him to delegate stuff to me, so I feel like working with him is a competition in my own head to try to jump on top of any work to be done because if I don't do the work within 5 minutes of it coming up, he just does it.
 Because the org isn't terribly large, we end up running out of work to do pretty quickly, and I start to get a little nervous that I'm not doing enough, or that I might get laid off or something if I don't continue to prove my worth to the org.
 The org I work for is actually awesome. I know a common perspective people have is to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck because "coporate overlord dont care about you, employee," but this org has been amazing to everyone with very generous compensation, org-wide raises that consist with inflation and THEN some, great benefits, and an overall healthy and productive environment/community of people.
 So, I really want to be doing more and being more useful because I feel like i just don't do anything all day and it's eating away at my soul every night lmao.
 anyone got any good suggestions? how do you keep growing when there isn't a fire under your ass?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a small company. Recently, I have been tasked with setting up a VPN server so that employees can access certain company resources remotely. I contacted the ISP and requested a static IP address block. However, I am unsure how to respond to the ISP's followup question about the configuration.
 For context, we are using CenturyLink/Lumen as the ISP and our hardware is part of the Unifi family. We originally planned to use an OpenVPN server, but recently discovered it was possible to run a VPN server directly on the Unifi hardware.
  
Your new LAN IP block is aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa/29 and it is statically routed to bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb. However, how would like us to configure the new IP block on the managed CPE, is there a specific interface you prefer for us to configure the new block on or statically route it to your LAN (Which next hop IP should we use) so you can use the whole /29 block?
  
What does "interface" mean in this context? Is this something on their end, or does this refer to our own hardware? Should I tell them to statically route the block to our LAN and provide the local IP address of our (network gateway? router?) as the next hop?
 I apologize if this is a stupid question, but our consultant has not been much help with this and I am a fish out of water here.
 Thanks!

However since they only gave me midrange on the salary I counteroffered near the top end and then they just said "I had withdrawn myself from the position". This was after I pointed out it was a 100% onsite job and that their offer was not commensurate* (edited, thank you /u/mudclub) with the cost of living in the area, especially housing. 
 There's a big difference between withdrawing and being lowballed.
 I'm interested to hear from my fellow sysadmins on how salary negotiations have gone from an offer to employment or to just turning your back on a potential employer.

One server and one storage array that needs to remain on. And another server I can shut off.
 Has anyone ever, with equipment mounted, slid the posts forward or back? It requires loosening a couple nuts, but they're in a track so it doesn't look like any equipment could actually drop. But obviously I'm most concerned about vibration, and that's the top reason I think this is a really bad idea. All three sets of rails mounted in the rack are adjustable depth.

We are expanding and have bought a building about 100 yards away for part of the office to move to. We have already installed a new modem/router from our ISP on a separate account and have it up and running. Now that the situation is explained I want to know the best way to go about this problem. 
 The people that are moving from building A into building B still need access to a shared file that is hosted on one of the windows computers. (not the way I would create a file-sharing system but it is what I have to work with.) The plan is to connect the network from building A to the new building B so they can access the locally shared file. I want to configure it so they can access the locally shared file on that network but the new ISP connection will handle all of the actual internet access. 
 Any help or recommendations would be appreciated. Feel free to ask about anything I left out.

 It originated from dealing with some of the server folks or helpdesk folks seeming to imply I'm responding with "it's not the network" without actually looking, so instead I prove I'm looking and showing them what I see to sort of "nip in the bud" any implication that I'm being dismissive, but now I do it out of habit. 
 Am I just an odd duck, or do some of you folks do that too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone ever used Netdisco with AES256 in SNMPv3? To my understanding it should support it just fine, but I cannot for the life of me get it to work with a cisco switch using AES256C. I don't think we have any devices on our network that use 256 that aren't cisco. 
 I can snmpwalk to that device successfully, and I have the same credentials configured within Netdisco (Which I believe USES the net-snmp library) but no luck at all no matter what I try. 
 Netdisco works great with our AES128 devices.
 Any tips on what I can try to get Netdisco to communicate to devices using AES256 or AES256C?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, 
 So I’m new to packet loss issues – this is my second network job but first time I’ve had to deal with it. So it seems like there is intermittent packetloss stemming from one specific device in our network… our Nexus 7706. At random times nodes all over our network stop responding and the common denominator is they are all patched to the 7706. They don’t all go down at once but when an event occurs you can be assured it’s patched to the nexus. It’s very random in both the time it happens as well as the devices it happens to – but again all uplinked to the 7706. 
 So my question is – where would I begin on troubleshooting this? Any real world advice here? This is where those damn ccna books do nothing for you… and unfortunately I’m a one man shop so I don’t have anyone to seek guidance from.

        <updated>2023-02-28T15:23:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am configuring a 3900 from FS (first one I've purchased from them) and it will be used as a WAN switch sitting between the ISP equipment to share the connection to two firewalls in an HA config (active/standby). There is a second ISP that connects to the HA firewalls and the equipment from that ISP has multiple ports for WAN and a WAN switch isn't needed on the second ISP link.
 It is a 24 port switch and I plan on using interfaces 1-12 for the WAN VLAN (to avoid using VLAN 1 and all 24 ports). I've already added the WAN VLAN and added those ports to that VLAN.
 The mgmt interface will be used for local access/configuration.
 Here are my questions (so far).
  
I'm going to confirm LLDP isn't active on ports 1-12.
 I'd like to configure SNMP to only send data to my internal SNMP server. I've seen switches/network devices that have fields/commands to send SNMP data to specific servers, but I've also left those fields blank and I can still log into my NMS and pull SNMP data from the switch given I have the correct information.
  
I'm currently reading through the 3900 manual to confirm the LLDP and SNMP commands, but I wanted to see if anyone here had any other suggestions that I may be missing to avoid leaking out data/information that should be avoided on the WAN side.
 Traditionally we've never done anything fancy to WAN switches, they are just L2 switches that we throw into the mix and we've also never had any management other than a local console cable IF a change needed to be made. Going forward, I'd like to change this and given that I have a local network port for management, I'd like to secure this switch the best way that I can.
 The default credentials have already been changed.
 Thanks.
 Edit- In other switches I've used, the management port is usually listed as out of band. I haven't found that to be the case for this 3900 switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm experimenting with a Juniper SRX and it seems static routing isn't as straight forward as it would be on a Cisco.
 I have my SRX connected to an L3 switch, with a network either side. On the L3 switch I've issued the static route command and set next hop as the Juniper interface that connects to the L3 switch.
 I added a static route in on the Juniper also, with next hop as L3 switch interface. However, when trying to ping from the Juniper network into the L3 network, my gateway comes back with destination net unreachable. In fact, when I logon to the Juniper over SSH, and try pinging the L3 switch interface, I get "no route to host" and when I look at the Juniper routing table, I see an entry for the L3 switch interface listed as a "rejected".
 I read somewhere that you can't simply add a static route onto a non point-to-point link on a Juniper. If that is the case, can someone explain how I can configure a basic static route on here?
 Many thanks

Essentially just a single site-to-site vpn back to an ASA, with a built in switch module. There is a single WAN interface where the crypto map is applied. This interface is public facing and is designed to be plugged into any commercially available IP (hotel, i.e. airport hotspot, etc) 
 We’re debating whats the better security practice on setting up controls on the WAN interface to only allow the IPSEC and ISAKMP traffic in. Is there any advantage or better practice to using ZBF on that port than just a simple inbound ACL that allows only those protocols though? Seems like the same end state from a security stand point

Karen clients: User thinks they know what they are doing, messes up, then calls IT. I offer solutions and the less practical one is declined in favor of the more expensive/complicated one. Then they call my boss/co-worker/etc., who gives them the exact same [simpler] solution, which they take, and claim I never offered it.
 Agent 99 situation: My boss/co-worker/etc. already knew of the situation and my solution. Then they offer the exact same thing as if it was their idea.
  
EDIT (FEB-28-23): The most common and upvoted suggestion seems to be document, document, document. At this point I don't know how much is paranoia and how much is reality. We are down to 40% staff and it's either document or let things go. This particular situation is a wireless network with lots of environmental, feeder controls and alarms for live animal experiments. The person who put it in place was fired and the documentation is all out of wack. At the same time that the Karen client is adding/moving things in the network without consulting. Literally 0 minutes to sit down and Document everything in the ticket, as it flows so quickly and the karen does not read them (and once claimed IT almost killed their experiments)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a small segment of our network, so this is really just one of the VLANs. We have about 70 houses (and a business office, and a school, and ...) that share a single internet connection. All the VDSL modems connect and work well. They can talk to the router, 172.23.72.1 and to devices on the other VLANs (172.23.68.10 for example). However, they cannot talk to each other and I'm baffled.
 The DSLAM is a Huwai MA5600/MA5800 with 4 VDSL cards. Transparent VLAN setup in the DSLAM. Everything gets an IP address fine. Each DSL modem has a "public, but private" IP from our internal network and then does NAT for devices in that house.
 DSL A cannot talk to DSL B. I'd like to be able to put a server/NAS behind A and access it from B. Presently, if I have a server behind A I can only access it from other VLANs on the network or devices not connected to the DSLAM.
 Anyone have any ideas what I'm missing?

We have Infoblox and could script this type of thing, but I’d rather have a solution that just works out of the box.

Everything in the subscription that has been built fresh logs in straight away, migrated VM's all have this issue. Not a massive problem but this is stopping me installing our MFA app as rdp times out before can get in, had to uninstall it via powershell in the end. Anyone come across this behaviour before?

The page usually says something like "make sure this is your security image!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 i wrote a thread some weeks ago about performance issues on our RDS farm. I did some more monitoring and saw that the cpu queue is sometimes a bit to high (about 5 - 10 for a 16 core VM).
 So i like to spread the user over more servers and read about the sizing guide from microsoft. Our users working with the office programs, ERP System and doing normal surfing and research via MS Edge and Google Chrome. Due to this workload i would say that its categorized in the heavy work load / power users.
 For that Microsoft says i should use 4 vCPU and about 8 GB RAM per User. Thats beeing said for our about 140 User, i shoud have about 144 vCPUs and 1 TB RAM. Thats seems quite high for me. Usally i dont provision 1:1 CPU ratio. 
 Microsoft also say, i should not provision more then 2 users per vCPU. Thats still 72 vCPUs for all. Due to the workload i dont get a good ratio about real threats and vCPU (on Hyper-V). 
 I'm quite curios about other RDS farms with about the same workload. I read some threats on the internet where 20 Users are on a quad core system with 16 GB RAM. Other wrote that they have 8 Core, 32 GB RAM but just provision it to 4 users. Its quite hard to see the real workload on other infrastructures. 
 So, could some people tell about their sizing in situation there the users doing a simiar workload?
 Thanks

 Let's say an IT administrator accidentally back-ups a 5 TB VM with Data Lock enabled. (which should not be backed-up at all) We would than have to pay for the storage consumption for this VM the entire year? There is no work-around to overcome this? 
 I know this is the purpose of immutable back-ups, but cost is also a big factor when using cloud back-up solutions like Druva.

 Or do i need to wipe and redeploy the entire business in one go? I'm guessing not because that seems impractical for large business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We have a client coming on board for support and would like a VPN. Normally we'd configure an SSTP VPN but in this case port 443 is already being routed to their webserver from the internet.
 If I forward another public port (say 414 as an example) to 443 private and point to the VPN server, would this work?
 I'd wager the connection address on SSTP client on other connecting windows endpoints would be vpn.CERTNAMEHERE.co.uk:414?
 Can you poke holes in that theory or point me towards a better solution?
 Besides another static IP that is referenced on the DNS entry to get to the WAN IP I'm struggling to come up with ideas.
 TIA!

 I am new in a company and have noticed that the Windows firewall is deactivated on almost 3000 servers. The reason: The effort to configure the firewall is too great or the Windows firewall would be pointless anyway. I would now like to change this situation and gradually activate the firewall on all servers. The problem is also that the necessary IPs and ports are hardly or not at all documented.
 ​
 Now my question: How would you proceed to achieve this goal? Simply switching on the firewall would instantaneously paralyse most servers. Firewall
 My idea would be: First document the active connections with netstat and write corresponding rules, then activate the firewall with Allow-Any for a certain time and then study the log to find more IPs and ports.
 ​
 I am curious about your suggestions and thank you in advance for your ideas.

 I am having an issue in our enviroment which i can't crack yet. 
 We migrated to M365, and let people work on their workstation. We offer some apps (including M365) as remote apps through RDS. We use Windows Server 2012 R2 (yea yea i know, we are upgrading asap)
 For the people saying, why don't use the local M365 apps. Our back-office system only works good on TS-systems and needs Outlook and word for some functionality. 
 The issue is, when people open attachement in this outlook app or from our back-office system. The outlook 'home' page (The page with inbox and all your e-mail) stays as the focused the screen. The openend attachement or e-mail from our back-office system stays behind that outlook screen until you open it from the taskbar. 
 I am getting the feeling it is an Server 2012 R2 issue or a remote app issue. When we used RDS with desktop for our users, they didn't have this issue but we used Office 2010 then and Exchange 2013.
 Thanks in advance,
 Kind regards,
 Roy de Jonge

 PolicyObject1 has a link order of 1, PolicyObject2has a link order of 2.
 PolicyObject1 will be applied first, then PolicyObject2 will be applied, overwriting PolicyObject1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was tough to come up with a title to sum up what I'm talking about but here are the details:
 We've got half a dozen offices and we are in the process of changing the WAN vlan at each one. Here's a very simplified diagram of one site with a made up subnet:
 https://i.imgur.com/lIDZX3R.png
 Like I said, this is a very simplified diagram but the part in question is accurate. I used the green arrows to show how traffic is flowing from outside to the local LAN. During this change I've got a constant ping going to a host inside the local network from another location across the MPLS.
 The process is:
  
I ssh into the WAN switch from outside (MPLS)
 Select all 4 interfaces at once
 issue the access vlan command
  
At this point I lose anywhere between 5 and 10 pings and then the connection comes back up. Now, I'm reasonably certain that the lost pings are caused by something to do with the MAC address table on the switch but I'm not 100% and I'd really like to understand specifically what causes the brief disconnect. I started labbing this up in GNS3 but I quickly realized that the switch emulation isn't good enough to accurately simulate this scenario.
 If this isn't enough detail I'm happy to provide more in order to help identify what's happening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /networking! 
 I've been fighting the classic "no internet" globe at our primary location for 2 years. It seems to rear it's ugly head every 6-10 months and of course this Monday was a classic explosion of multiple computers not allowing Outlook to function even though the internet was connected. I've spent hours...nay days on this. 
 Our standard fix has been:
  
`sfc /scannow` `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth` [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet] EnableActiveProbing set to 1 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] NoActiveProbe set to 0 `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] DisablePassivePolling set to 1 restart computer 
  
I finally realized that an nslookup with "server 131.107.255.255" to any request fails...pcap shows no response from the server what-so-ever. Confirmed the traffic is being passed by the firewall and no clear blocks from anti-virus. 
 I can do a DNS request all day from other networks and IPs. I have access to a number of sites and all of them respond instantly to a dns query to the classic nds.msftncsi.com IP. Any recommendations on how to find out if MS is blacklisting my primary site IP? Who/how do I contact Microsoft regarding this?
 The above fixes have worked previously but of course today, something has changed and 3 computers continue to not function even after the fixes. I do not have IPv6 running on this network. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks for any rabbit holes I may not have run down. This has me frustrated and stumped. I think the fact that DNS isn't responding is my smoking gun but I don't know how to take it to the next level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My fellow Redditors,
 I am redistributing BGP from my router into an OSPF process located in a VRF (Area 1). My router is connected to the Neighbor Router via Area 1. Area 1 is configured as a stub area. 
 My understanding of a stub area is that it blocks Type 5 LSAs. I am redistributing into the OSPF process that includes the stub area. Since my path would be BGP -> OSPF (Backbone Area 0) -> OSPF Area 1 (VRF) -> Neighbor Router (Area 1), does the Stub router located in OSPF Area 1 deny the Type 5 LSA coming via the Backbone area? 
 My understanding is that a Stub Area does not allow an ASBR to exist within it. My router that is redistributing BGP -> OSPF would be considered an ASBR. However, since I'm going from OSPF Area 0 to OSPF Area 1 in a VRF, does the VRF act as an ABR (and not an ASBR) thereby allowing the Stub area to receive the type 5 LSA?
 I understand the simple solution is to configure the Neighbor Router as a NSSA. However, this may not be a possibility. 
 Am I overthinking this? It is as simple as I am coming from BGP -> OSPF and the Stub Area prevents that type 5 LSA from entering it (VRF or not)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spearphish attempt came as a fake reply to real e-mail that was several years old, from a vendor that had an email compromise.
 The attachment is a password protected zip with the password in message body and something about being unable to send the attachment otherwise (very true in this case).
 Extracted first payload contains large .htm which uses HTML smuggling to drop a second zip file with same password while putting up fake Office 365 page telling you how to open it.
 Second payload contains an .img file which mounts a filesystem and includes a .lnk shortcut to unleash the nastiness.
 From here everything is deeply obfuscated and resistant to being run in a sandbox. Proceeding any farther would require downloading payload files from the Internet and alerting the sender so this is where I stop for now. Even posting the filenames they use could leak information. I will say that the payload files all date from June to November 2021.
 The whole thing closely matches the technique described here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/
 So that's fun.

        <updated>2023-02-27T20:09:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been working on a project that involves taking the existing network of 192.168.1.0, splitting it up into VLANs and creating additional VLANs to allow for a Data Network and Voice Network. I have a Layer 3 core switch which is connected to an ASA and all of the VLANs are configured on the core switch. I implemented the design this weekend and am having trouble with the connections from the new VLANs to the pre-existing network.
 My configuration is as follows:
 ASA
 int g1/1 - Outside
 int g1/2 - Inside - 192.168.1.1 (Connected to Core Switch)
 route inside 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route inside 192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.2 is directly connected via g1/2 
 Core Switch
 vtp mode server
 int g1/0/1 (Connected to ASA)
 switchport access to vlan 10
 int vlan 10
 ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 80
 ip add 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 90
 ip add 192.168.102.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 
 ip routing is enabled 
 So here's what I've found so far:
 I can ping from 192.168.1.x to any other VLAN
 I can't ping the other way around
 DHCP is working. I'm able to receive all DHCP information and can reach the internet.
 I can ping all SVIs and ASA from 192.168.101.x
 I can't ping between 192.168.101.x and 192.168.102.x networks 
 There are ACLs applied to the inside interface on the ASA, but they appear to permit all icmp traffic and all ip traffic.
 I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this exact issue as searching on Google has been no help. I mostly get results with configurations that involve using the ASA for Inter-VLAN networking, using sub-interfaces and whatnot. I am strictly trying to setup Inter-VLAN networking on the L3 switch. Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have this guy that works... "works"... with us and we've noticed an increase in the frequency that we see Netflix up on his computer, through his browser. Now, we don't have a problem with someone pulling up Netflix while they work for background noise, if it helps them get the work done more efficiently, I myself have YouTube videos up while I'm working, it helps me concentrate and get my work done, and my boss doesn't have a problem with it. The major issue is that this guy doesn't really do anything, just sits on Yahoo! all day and watches Netflix. So we were thinking, we should block Netflix on his computer. The only problem is, Netflix has thousands of IP addresses, and trying to block, or redirect, based on IP would take a long time, time that we don't really have.
 So my question is this... does anyone know of an effective way to block Netflix on a domain computer, and only that domain computer? Blocking the site on the network completely is not an option, based on the nature of our work environment, so we need it to be just for one computer. We also do not want him to know that we actively blocked it, he has a bad temper and flies off the handle when things like this are brought up, and retaliation is a real fear, so a redirect to localhost is preferred. If it's not possible, I get it, but we need him to not be on Netflix all day.
 NOTE: 1.) My boss can't fire him, he's been trying. 2.) He's tried talking to him about things like this before, it doesn't work. 3.) HR has been ineffective at helping the situation, their advice as "All you can do is talk to him."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up a complex system using a cisco nexus with full routing enabled. I need to have two VRFs set up for regulations requirements. I need to get 4 networks on the switch run through 2 vrfs out two physical interfaces up to the firewall where Policy can handle it and let things go out to the internet. I am having trouble actually configuring it.
 The basic set up is kind of like this: 
 VR-Office
 vlan 12
 10.10.12.0/22
 10.10.12.1 gateway 
 vlan 16
 10.10.16.0/24
 10.10.16.1 gateway
 int eth1/1 ip add 172.16.16.129 #the far end will have an add of 16.130 
 VR-Accounting
 vlan 112
 10.20.12.0/22
 10.20.12.1 gateway 
 vlan116
 10.20.16.0/24
 10.20.16.1 gateway
 int eth1/2 ip add 172.16.16.133 #other side will have address 16.134 
 I need the two vlans to have an svi per vlan that I can add to the associated VRFs. Then I need to route to physical interfaces associated to the vrfs.
 The way I logically manage it in my head I imagine that the office vrf has two SVIs, one per vlan, with each having the IP address of the vlans gateway. Then the office vrf also has the physical interface. 
 I want to make sure that the vlans 12 and 16 are only routing on vrf vr-office and can be routed our eth1/1 to get out. 
 Am I misunderstanding anything? Would anyone be willing to explain how this might look in a L2/L3 router's config? I feel like I am missing something simple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that encrypted DNS is becoming more common and Android is supporting this by default a question I believe is very stupid just popped in my mind. TLS certificates require domain names to work so DNS over TLS only works if you provide a hostname instead of an IP address, but if the device is connecting to a network for the first time and the DHCP server only provides the hostnames for the DNS servers then how is the device going to resolve the hostname to connect to the DNS server in the first place? Also, what if I'm connected to a single DNS server that supports DoT and the cached IP address disappears or something? How are these situations handled? And if you just cannot resolve any query then are you supposed to provide the IP address of the server as a fallback option? What is the best way to proceed?

Tell people to go get certified at MS and they will reimburse for the exam fee.. for some certs... as long as its in your "role" (so Servers can go for Azure, Desktop for M365 and you cannot leave your lane), No time off to do them, its either during the 40-50 hours you are "allocated' to a project or on your personal time. No reward for completion except a "badge" (ie congratulations email) if you complete several ("its expected you complete training as part of your role").

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as the title says I believe that the company has lost all their data. There was a storm overnight that turned the power off for a while and when everyone came in this morning computers turned on like normal except the "server" (Win10 machine with all shared files on it). Basically the machine would not boot windows. Plugged the SSD into another computer and saw the data was RAW instead of NTFS. I have to format the drive in order to use the SSD again. They had 2 external drives plugged into the computer for backing up but apparently the last time anything was done on the drives was back in 2020 and there weren't even any backups. Is there anyway to recover the SSD without formatting or is it a total loss? The company does not have IT, they call us whenever there's an issue and we offered to do cloud backups a while back but they're cheap and refused saying they'd do it on their own.
 Update: the computer was windows 10 but they were running server 2019 on Hyper V. SSD has Been sent to data recovery center

The issue is that the main switch (Ubiquity) only allows mirroring of one port. This would be fine, except that I have redundant firewalls, with automatic fail over. The second FW is connected to another port on the switch.
 My thought was to put a HUB between the firewalls and the main switch, then plug the monitor into that.

 set interfaces ae8 native-vlan-id 1 set interfaces ae6 unit 0 family ethernet-switching native-vlan-id default 
 After doing some reading, I think it's just the difference in setting that actual ae8 interface to native vlan 1, whereas the second command is setting the logical ae6.0 interface to native vlan default which on this switch is also vlan ID 1. So vlan default = vlan 1. Wouldn't each interface act the same with anything on vlan 1?
 The change I am making is swapping po1 and 2 vlans. So I don't know why when I move po1 (which owns the default, or vlan1 traffic) to po2, traffic stops flowing. I feel it has something to do with the above commands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I am about to buy a new laptop, for my job. My job consists of a basic office work, excel, word, outlook and little bit of graphic design, photoshop. In my free time, I like to play games, mostly Dota 2, warzone.
 So I started to look for a laptop, for office work. I found out that if I dont want the lowest tier office laptop, I am gonna pay around 700-800 € (which is my budget). For this price, I can find some lower tier gaming laptops (10- 11th gen intel, rtx 3050, 144 Hz displays which I find very comfortable to work with). 
 Thats where my dilemma starts, would you rather buy a mid tier office laptop, but not have the ability to use it for entertainment, or aim for lower tier gaming laptop which may have some disadvatages ( overheating, weight, noise)? 
 My best options I found on the web so far:
 Office laptops: DELL Latitude 15-3520, ASUS Vivobook 15X OLED X1503ZA-MA437W,
 Gaming laptops: MSI GF63 Thin 11SC, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IHU6 Shadow Black 
 All of these are approximately 800€ (you can suggest different). Besides that, I am have a desktop PC at home, mid tier gaming machine, but sometimes I work from outside my home. I dont have any laptop right now.
 Thank you your replies, I appreciate all of the advices and shared experiences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a major power event at our main data center yesterday. Maintenance was being performed on our UPS, something went wrong and we lost all power to all of the racks including our production Nutanix cluster (5 hosts, ~120 running VMs) and our main backup repository (Dell Data Domain). I was shocked when we powered everything back up and there wasn't a single data corruption issue (that we have found). In hindsight, I know I should have shut everything down gracefully ahead of time but they assurred me it was routine thing that they do all the time and it wouldn't cause any issues. That should have been the red flag.
 The point of my story is....we've come a long way in recent years in terms of preventing data corruption. I remember a time when pulling the power on a SQL Server while running would almost certainly mean recovering databases from a backup. Chalk one up for progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning fellow nerds and geeks,
 I need some advice on my career trajectory. I've been working for a company for 10 years and I recently moved into a management slot overseeing our department. It's a small shop, but a really good company and I was really enjoying it.
 Fast forward to a few weeks back, and we were bought out. It's looking like I'm going to be back in a sys admin position. While it's not terrible considering I have the same wage, seniority, and WFH, I'm concerned it'll hurt me moving back into a management slot. I'm concerned that the longer I'm out of the position, the harder it'll be to move back up.
 What is your experience with this? Is my concern unfounded, or should I start looking again? We've not moved over to the new company just yet, but it looks like there's no management slots available and likely won't be for some time. The current staff have all been there for a long time and don't look to be moving on anytime soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! My parents have a business with a large variety of jackets in 3 different locations with over 1000 jackets. What I want to do is make a inventory system which can be accessed from each of those store locations using a barcode system with a barcode reader and a inventory software. 
 Simply my goal with this software is to see: - Quantity of a certain product by location - the sizes available of the product
 I dont need the software to be linked with the cash register.
 For example if a product is sold. I want to scan the barcode and decrease the quantity of how many of the products is left.
 Or the exact opposite. When new products arrive i want to print a barcode and stick it on the product and then enter it into the inventory system.
 I understand that for this i will need
  
multiple barcode scanners
 barcode printer
  
Have you guys ever worked with this type of software and also which software is the best and cheapest for this system.

 If no errors that means drive is perfectly good
 Can we say that?
 Also started 3 disks Sanitize Overwrite and looks like gonna take 48 hours is this expected?

 I work for a mid-sized company of about 160 users.
 We're currently looking for a secure web gateway kind of product. We previously ran a POC of Netskope, but this didn't turn out very well for us. We've looked at other solutions such as Zscaler, Perimeter81 and Cloudflare One, but I'm curious to know what others have used in this space and how effective those products have been.
 The main things we are looking for are:
  
Filtering traffic(DNS, HTTP, Network based, etc..)
 Can provide some kind of secure access to non-public facing web apps.
 Has some kind of Malware filter for web traffic.
 Detects shadow IT usage. - Defender for cloud apps does some of this, but doesn't seem super robust.
  
Thanks everyone.

 Just wondered if anyone had any thoughts? I've sent the laptop to Dell but it's come back saying USB ports are fine (which I assumed).

Ideally this would be cheap, or free, as we are education/public sector.

 On the github page OP said to change values one has to go to
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin 
 But after installing the app, that key does not appear in that path (or any other path), so do I have to create it manually?
 I also wrote some PS code to create the key if its not there with my veeery limited PS syntax knowledge and some AI, but it also doesnt seem to work. While it does install the app (if its in the same directory as the script for now), it does not create the key.
 $software = "MakeMeAdmin 2.3.0 x64.msi" $msiPath = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot $software if (Test-Path $msiPath) { Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList "/i `"$msiPath`" /quiet /passive" if (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ProductFilter -Filter "Name='$software'") { Write-Output "'$software' is installed." # Create the MakeMeAdmin key if it does not exist if (!(Test-Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin")) { New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\" -Name "MakeMeAdmin" -Force | Out-Null } # Set the AdminRightTimeout value to 60 minutes New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin" -Name "AdminRightTimeout" -Value "60" -PropertyType DWORD -Force } else { Write-Output "'$software' NOT installed." } } else { Write-Output "MSI package '$software' not found." } 
 Sorry if the post sounds confusing, I am lost myself rn haha

 Please bare with me as my windows admin experience is nonexistent. At the corp. I work for, they are largely a windows shop and while they have been generous to provide admin rights on developer machine. Basically their development process is very manual and limited automation.
 So trying to get automation in is rather challenging due to the firewall. EG: I cannot use terraform as trying to use it from the terminal fails due to the proxy settings. Similar for minikube or pulling from the docker hub. In December there was some screw up because I could actually pull docker containers from hub.docker.com. When speaking to the infosec people they keep telling me we need static IP's so that they can allow those sites. However trying to find out who can assign static IP's just results in the run around. 
 Surely there is a way with windows group policies to allow developers in that policy to get access to terraform/npm/docker?
 I think the firewall solution is from fortinet if that helps with suggestions.

 So now I want to get this automated. The goal would be to only hit the "accept" button in the slack-app and the permission for the user get set automatically and also get removed after a set date.
 I don't really know how to do this technically.
 Maybe you have an idea or direction on how to achieve this, so I can do some further research. :)

 I had just assumed that MS did MFA like everyone else with paired app TOTPs and therefore the option to use 3rd party with apps
 Just heard about number matching and enforcement imminent
 I tried the MS auth app w number matching and user experience was aweful. Also it forced me to register my private device to the company, something I can’t expect of users.
 User base is low tech low paid shift work care staff. This needs so be SIMPLE
 I’ve been rolling out SF MFA this last year to different orgs and it’s a breeze.
 Can someone give me some pointers? Also willing to pay an hour or two to help determine my MFA strategy.

Our customer has access to Alcatel-Lucent switches with a significant discount. My last experiences with Alcatel were not the best, with them being tedious and slow to configure, but that was about 12 years ago. We primarily use Cisco and Dell for core and access switches these days and I am currently thinking about sticking to what we know best or just going with Alcatel to save money. We are planing to use stacked 48 Port 1G PoE Switches as access switches and 48 Port 25G switches witch MLAG as core switches.
 What are your thoughts and experiences with Alcatel?
 Features that are important for us (apart from stability and support of course):
  
configuration through a CLI interface which can be automated with ansible
 stacking for access switches, MLAG for core switches
 a solid 802.1X implementation with multi-host support

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm preparing to setup Linux VM deployment for our application team, the goal is to setup a basic VM via template and then deploy the OS and all standard configurations automatically.
 The distros will vary, depending on the requirements, but overall they will deploy Ubuntu (22.04 or 20.04) and RHEL (probably 9, maybe 8).
 For lifecycle management like updates and config changes we will probably be using Ansible, but how could I automate the deployment process across those distributions?
 I am aware of kickstart, but afaik this is a Fedora/RHEL based tool, would it be possible to deploy Ubuntu as well?
 I'm asking this, because Ubuntu has it's own deployment tools, if I get this right, which is Autoinstall/Cloud-Init, and I would prefer to use only one method for both distros.
 What would be the best approach to this, otherwise?
 I'm sorry if something seems unclear, I'm pretty new to linux administration (dipping into it right now)
 All answers appreciated!

 I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, if it's not I'll remove my post.
 My boss asked me to remove all local admin users from the domain. Doesn't seem too hard so that's going to be easy. The hard part is supporting the users which have the local admin accounts.
 Some users need to change their IPv4-Address to work with servers. I fixed this with the local group Windows 10 has which is called "Network Configuration Operators". All users which need to change their IPv4 Address are automatically added in this Group via a Group Policy.
 Now I wanted to know if I can do the same thing with allowing users to create bootable USB-Drives and give them the permission to partition USB-Disk Partitions. 
 I checked the builtin Windows 10 groups but didn't find a group which could enable this. Maybe someone can help me with this?
 Thanks in advance!
 Sorry for my bad english, english isn't my first language.

 Any tips on designing them in P-Touch editor and getting the alignment to keep when transferring them to the labeler templates for use on the device? We can use the software or the app, but it's so nice when it does work that you can just enter in a pre-set field or two and it prints the same everytime.
 For a simple two line label, with two "titles" the alignment never lines up.
 I know some of you guys use p-touch so thought I'd ask before I pull my hair out over a darn labeler.

 Would using Defender + Huntress ( Managed Cybersecurity Platform for SMBs and IT Providers | Huntress ) be a good replacement?

 Just about any routing feature I’d need is present, not to mention the performance is pretty impressive.
 One of the things I don’t see in FRR’s documentation, and this was confirmed by some of the FRR devs as well, is there’s no Netflow/IPFIX/Sflow capabilities.
 Obviously FRR is intended to be a routing suite, and that’s understandable, but has anyone here using FRR found a library for this purpose on Debian that is actively maintained and has enough flexibility to be considered viable for being used alongside FRR?

Many of these sites are OUs under a domain, so domain admin gives full reign across enterprise level organization. Right now, it's a real cluster f.
 Im looking at a few different products that will allow us to centrally manage AD and Group Policy using a more delegated approach and added auditing. Pulling away from traditional AD tools and bringing things home to a central interface. 
 I would love to hear some suggestions from other admins on what they are using or have used, pros and cons.

 Just curious on how everyone running older equipment…or Cat9200s…supporting auto-install mode are doing ZTP with DHCP. Specially in regards to DHCP scopes where native VLANs don’t exist.
 At all of our locations everything is tagged and a defunct/unused native VLAN is used.
 And idea I had was to create a small network just for the ZTP configuration on the branch router and then just abandon it afterwards.
 Curious how everyone else does it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building a home-lab, I really wanted it look like an actual realistic network that an SMB was utilizing. This site was quite helpful, but I discovered that I had a hard time coming up with fake users, fake documents, and the like to make it actually look like an internal company network that was in use.
 Whilst doing this, I thought to ask ChatGPT for some help on the matter, and the results were quite helpful. I gave the prompt:
  
I'm trying to learn how to become a sys-admin, in order to do this I'm creating a homelab in VMware, I want this homelab to be a realistic simulation of an SMB, please generate some fake, but reasonable information about this fictional SMB that I'm emulating for training purposes. 
  
It gave me some excellent data that would likely take me forever to think of on my own. It included names of employees, their good/bad passwords, company details like location and size, it even gave me data about the technology they used!
 I've seen people use ChatGPT for writing scripts or fixing problems, but with dubious accuracy. Alot of the solutions are good, but it seems about half of them contain some manner of issues and inaccuracies. However, it seems that ChatGPT's excellence in making up BS can actually be used for good!
 EDIT: Let it be known that ChatGPT's accuracy is sometimes a bit better than half, but in all fairness I wouldn't trust it enough to justify some peoples uses for it. Although generating reasonable, but fake information seems to have a 100% chance of working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently made the jump from an organization that really didn't value IT. We were a necessary evil but IT wasn't something that the company liked to spend money on. We were running on shoestring budgets and poor leadership. We were expected to move mountains and were in constant fire fighter mode. 
 The new organization is much more mature and more resourced. The IT team appears to be at least 10 times the size of the previous company. Everything is organized, automated and cutting edge. There are clear expectations and IT appears to be highly regarded by the leadership team. 
 My initial reaction was feeling like there is nothing for me to do at the new company since there aren't any burning fires to put out but I realized that this new environment and change in culture offers me time to actually grow. I can actually focus and learn new things rather than run from one problem to another. 
 Just wondering how others have gone through this experience. My hope is that I will be able to really level up in the new role.

 It’s also weird cause so many of those folks that work non-tech jobs like farming end up wanting to learn to code and switch to a desk job after 10 years.

 Is one newer or older than the other?
 Does anybody have any personal preferences, with any reasons between these?
 (I saw Knipex also makes some fiber optic strippers - Knipex 12 82 130 SB and Knipex 12 85 110 SB, however, there don't seem to be many reviews for them, and I assume they're not as well known as the Miller gear)

 I currently use advanced IP scanner but it doesn’t placate pull through users. The company I work for is actively trying to reduce our electricity by having users power down on a Friday. It’s not happening though as on Monday mornings they don’t like waiting, when I run advanced up scanner it tells me machine names etc but not always the users. 
 Sadly My predecessors didn’t keep note of machine names and who they went to so it would take ages to sit and go through things.

We currently uses a very heavily Customized version of Dynamic AX and we'd like to upgrade to a new ERP system that replicates as much of this as possible so we don't have to maintain and import all of our customizations.
 A lot of emphasis on the features and input process for Sales Orders to make it easy to input with huge numbers of size/color/fabric and customization variations.
 And also to manage the many stages that are involved in creating the custom apparel for the people involved in actually producing them at each stage.
 We also have a lot of custom reports, so it would be great to have a good BI system, separate data warehouse so that running reports doesn't affect performance of the main system.
 We are about 300 employees and growing.

The functionality I liked was being able to THAW and FREEZE computers whenever I need to change any software or install an updates. That's really all I need to do, I don't need to do any monitoring or anything like that as I use Veyon.
 I am looking to a easy to use alternative that is hopefully open source, but my search results are all turning up kaput. I see a lot of talk about group policies and temporary accounts. I'm not too verse on those. Right now the lab is set up as 32 bare metal computers with an admin and a student account. We are constantly adding software that is beneficial for us, but students are also finding ways to circumvent and install other bloatware applications which is why I am looking for a Deep Freeze alternative, any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently I was asking a question about how to fix Grub if I'm installing Windows after Ubuntu. I found the solution. But now I want to ask about aftermaths of boot-repair. So, my system was working like this before:
  
Ubuntu with Grub
 Windows on hdd
  
So what I did is I unplugged every drive, I installed Windows on new m2 ssd, connected old hdd (where my old windows was located), transfered all data and formatted hdd so it's now just a storage for windows. Then I connected ssd with my ubuntu and run boot-repair from my usb flash. After that grub got fixed and I can choose between new Windows and Ubuntu, and it's all working.
 But one thing that bothers me is that there's still old Windows left on grub menu, even tho I formatted old hdd with Windows. Also in UEFI there were added more options to boot from, like ubuntu (m2 ssd) and ubuntu (hdd) even tho ubuntu is not installed there at all. I have the logs from boot-repair saved, if they're safe to share, I can share them. Also I can screenshot my partitions if it's needed, just tell me what to run, I'm not a pro in such things, and it seems like no-one in other communties can help me (I asked this question many times), so please don't delete the question, because last time I asked here something, it got deleted even tho it didn't violate any rules, but I was lucky enough to get the answer before it got deleted, so I came here again, as my last hope, not trying to violate anything.
 My question is, should I be worried about something? Or it's not of a big deal and I can forget about it? It also says when I'm booting to Ubuntu "failed to set APST feature" and something starts going on, and eventually it loads after a little time and works fine, new Windows on m2 ssd works fine too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a recent networking grad working for a big bank. I remember as a student delving into automation, everything was new and interesting. I had a lot of fun setting up small topologies in GNS3 and automating commands with Ansible and Nornir.
 Now that I’ve started my career, I’m very interested (from a selfish point of view but also as a way to increase my skills) in taking my automation skills to the next level.
 I’m under no illusions that throwing Python scripts to automate some config changes does not make me some automation wizard. Anyone with a keen interest in learning automation can get to that point in no time at all.
 With that being said, I’d really appreciate some seasoned automation people to share cool ideas they’ve implemented. 
 I was thinking of looking into how to create a web GUI that takes in a command and runs them against some specified devices. But then I think Ansible Tower is pretty similar to that, so I don’t think that would be the best return on time for me to create that (bearing in mind it’d take me a long time to learn how to create web GUIs).
 This post was borne out of a desire to understand how to get to the next level. As I’m working for a large enterprise with many networking colleagues, I want to be able to build automation tools that others can use, not just some one-off Python scripts.

 For a week or two I plan to run both concurrently, in a primary/failover scenario, while I make sure everything is solid.
 I've always had IPv6 via DHCP-PD; I know the new ISP provides IPv6 as well (it was able to pull a v6 address), including PD (based on reading).
 I set up the router to grab PD from both WANs, but so far it's only pulling/using the primary ISP.
 I've been looking around, and I see that multi-wan PD is perhaps a common issue... then it occurred to me that perhaps it's not even possible, given that such a configuration would essentially multi-home each host (right?).
 so my question is simple - is it even possible to use DHCPv6-PD from multiple ISPs without using BGP?
 Thanks in advance!

 I work in IT for a company that has in the last few months been plagued by an update that has made it so nearly every computer we own now auto-locks after 2-5 minutes. We have opened up a support ticket with Microsoft and they deny anything is wrong, but other companies have agreed with us that this is new and is affecting them as well.
 To try and bypass this new "feature" we have tried: 
  
rolling back the update - Didn't work
 modifying power plan settings - didn't work 
 Power plan advanced settings - didn't work
 
 Windows settings - didn't work
 Various registry edits - didn't work*
 Disabling Windows Dynamic Lock (this is normally disabled by our policy anyway, but that's a whole other story) - didn't work
 Disabling Dell Optimiser on computers that have it - Didnt work
  
There are no settings in our Azure AD tenant, group policy, or on-prem domain that pertain to screen saver and screen lock timers
 * we did find a registry key that disables the computer's ability to lock entirely (including using Win+L), but this poses a security issue for obvious reasons and so we aren't going this route. 
 So far the only thing I have found was earlier today when I was working on this issue is that my windows screen saver settings auto default back to five minutes even after changing the settings AND modifying the registry key to set the screen saver up to 15 minutes.
 I also found that my computer's screen will lock after 2 minutes but when I boot in safe mode it goes. up to 5. 
 We now have upper management breathing down our necks because everyone is complaining about this issue and the CIO is trying to fend everyone off the best they can while we figure this out but nothing is working.
 Does anybody have ANY ideas because we're at wits end here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to get a new AD install going, but all our ESX hosts are 7+ years old and won't install.
 I have quotes from people from using KVM to VMware, but I can't get funding for a completely new VM system. (Was quoted $45k-150K depending on vendor for 3 host 20 vm load with backup)
 I need to get this as cheap as possible (<$5k) with reliability.
 The demand of the system is very very low. We have probably 80 windows clients that are AD joined, and use the DNS service. It also syncs to Azure and runs google script (I know it should be a PAW, but right now don't have the vm to do this).
 Part of me thinks, okay bare metal, how few times anything has actually failed, it is likely to be fine.
 Throw together a box, install, and go.
 But the gnawing part of me says, do VM. But what part of VM makes sense unless a 2nd host can run it (Azure/AWS for backup?) and the storage is accessable.. (without spending on NAS/SAN, have a removeable raid 1 storage so it can go to another device)?
 Anyone have ideas on the minimal install for a server? Is proxmox or such worthwhile with small workstations that are under 2k each?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/sysadmin, I'm an aspiring threat hunter who has been working as a cybersecurity engineer for about five years. While designing and implementing systems is fun, the detective work appeals to my inner curiosity.
 Much of my research around getting started in this field suggests learning an OS in-and-out, a close-second is learning a scripting language. Because I work in a Windows environment, it's sensible to start with Windows and PowerShell. This makes sense, but I don't know how to go about tackling the former. 
 There are some books, like Powershell for SysAdmins, that can teach me Windows administration through PowerShell--hitting two birds with one stone. Is this advisable or should I begin by learning Windows core processes and its other components independently of PowerShell so I don't get overwhelmed?
 I fear I'm overthinking this, and I'd welcome that constructive criticism if that's what's going on. Helping me develop this area of my roadmap would be much appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I’m looking at options to simplify the management of multiple accounts across multiple tenants for our executive team. 
 Our execs will use accounts in the following separate tenants managed by separate IT teams:
 MrExec@company1.com MrExec@company2.com MrExec@company3.com
 They need to be able to send and receive mail on all 3 accounts but only really need to be fully Microsoft licensed on their primary. Currently they have licenses in all 3 and open 3 separate mailboxes in Outlook with various forwarding rules etc set up.
 Ideally it would be much simpler for them to manage with one account and mailbox and just use aliases from the other tenants but I haven’t been able to find any good docs on how to do that or if it’s even possible. Tenants have to stay as separate entities due to the way the companies are silo’d. 
 Looking for recommendations on how to do this simpler/better! Thank you

 Anyway...We’re doing some IT work for a friend and we need to replace an aging PC where Atrium is installed. I’m aware that in addition to the Atrium software itself there’s also a SQL database behind. Not sure if there are other dependencies or not. I have the Atrium software install for the new PC, but what steps are required to get everything transferred and running on the new PC while retaining all existing settings\access and of course not “breaking” anything.
 I was thinking the steps would be something like this. Or am I way off base here?
  
Backup existing SQL database
 Install Atrium software on new PC
 Restore database backup on new PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have about 30 odd new machines from Dell which have Windows 10 Pro installed. Instead of using our software imaging (Quest KACE) to save a bit of time I showed our desktop techs that they can simply put in the Windows 10 Enterprise key from our software licensing (we have an enterprise agreement) which saves the time on having to re image. They like the idea of saving time but also liked that the image answered the Windows installation questions from the Unattend.xml file I built within KACE scripted installations (we want to move away from KACE K2000 and don't have SCCM).
 What I want to know is if it is possible to put an answer file of any sort into one of these new Dell machines to answer all the basics and setup a simple admin user so they can then get on the domain right away and start working.
 I have tried pulling the command prompt at OOBE load (Shift + F10) and have thrown an Unattend.xml file in both the C:\Windows\Panther and C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep folders but nothing happened as I had hoped.
 Any ideas? I hope this is clear enough, please ask any questions for clarification.

Came into a place that has fat clients everywhere with no servers and everything MS365 cloud/onedrive. Passwords are flying around all over the place. And yes, they also used (and still use) Lastpass, which is, as we all know, compromised. When I came there, there were NO BACKUPS. Boss thought they were unnecessary because "everything is taken care of by Microsoft". It took me 2 months to convince him that he was wrong about that. So I did implement a backup system which is running now. Also took care of other stuff and was testing out Intune for consistent MDM deployment.
 Boss was also global admin himself and fucks around with permissions and settings, causing problems that I don't understand because he doesn't tell me what he changed.
 He also has this minion dude that works a couple hours a week and barely knows how to install a computer.
 So yesterday I get called in and get this 3 page letter stating that I'm doing everything wrong, got my priorities wrong, I meddle in things that I should not meddle in, I'm watching Netflix at work on my laptop, which is a complete lie, and I'm not following orders. I'm not 21, I'm 52 with a ton of experience who's jaw dropped when he said that he didn't need any backups.
 So at the end of the talk, he says he withdraws my admin rights. So now I can't do anything. "Sure you can, just pick out the roles that you need". The little minion still retains rights.
 The little minion also says that I did not share the backup account password with him. I did. He looked in the wrong column of the spreadsheet.
 What the hell should I do?

 We are trying to on board a new vendor who deployed their resources on AWS. Our team wants to connect to their platform using a single public IP. But they have many machines and some of them are created on demand. Is it possible to get into their network using a single private IP to access all machines?
 Not sure if I have provided all information required. Let me know if you need more.

 I am finishing up a migration from Intermedia (hosted Exchange) to Office 365. I have almost everything set up, but am facing a stumbling block. If you have any idea how to fix it or even another way of doing things, I'd appreciate your advice.
 To preface, our public folders contain mailbox enabled folders that have their own aliases that external users e-mail regularly. Our current setup allows only users assigned a public folders role to have access to see the public folders as its own entity under folders in their Outlook client. No one else sees it. For the migration, we are using BitTitan.
 In Office 365, I set up the public folder and using BitTitan, migrated the stuff over. I set explicit permissions using the public folder GUI in the Exchange admin center. However, everyone is seeing the public folders as if it's a shared mailbox shared with everyone. I've found out how to limit unauthorized users from accessing the content, but the public folder mailbox remains. Any ideas of how to get rid of the mapping entirely for certain users?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent the last few weeks dealing with cloud services where something is broken and they just don't care. It's ranged from a simple UI bug that provides incorrect instruction that would lead to an outage, to a poorly designed and documented system that will lead to a legitimate loss of data. I've heard responses from "voice your concern in the community forum and let people vote on it" to "that's just how it's going to work, it's up to you to deal with possible data loss"
 I don't regret cloud services...I don't want to be thinking about CPU, storage, rackspace, maintenance windows, etc for every application I'm tasked with, but i do think that the exorbitant subscription licensing costs should provide some equal amount of product improvement and support. Maybe I've been huffing too much of the cloud not knowing it's just smoke?

Low being 5-10 per day if that...each environment is in an isolated zone and confirmed no deny alerts when attempting to send, in fact we see the outbound connection as successful. now what am i missing? is this an 0365 issue (have opened a ticket just in case).

 Kinda novice on this, I am building a windows 11 image for rollout. I understand that an "image" is not the most modern way to do it but I'm on a very limited time schedule. My question is about copyprofile in the autounattend.xml file. On Microsoft's website it says that if you use copyprofile you need to delete certain registry entries after the fact using regedit. You need to load it up, open a hive etc. Is there an easy way to accomplish this over command line so it can be automated?

 I've tried to find documentation on this, but it's not in the manual. My concerns are:
 -Will this create a loop? Does STP even work on the OOB int?
 -Does doing this provide the expected solution, where if member 1 fails, the stack can still be managed via the OOB interface on the second member.
 -Would the management IP somehow move to the other OOB int?

What happens is that your eyes may roll and get stuck when they get a glimpse of the captain of your brain for guidance, but he’s having the same problem, and his captain is having the same problem (etc) thus causing a multi dimensional recursive state. Eventually your neural stack overflows.
 But take comfort, your brain will reboot. You will try to reprocess events, but those poor neurons are fried. And don’t bother talking about the problem to anyone; it’s scrap code that will only give more form to a problem that should not exist.
 Don’t complain at all. It isn’t going to add any sense. Just put that little layer 8 object in a box, and push it into the sea of your mind, toward the waters where DNS probably lurks.

 Was wondering if I could get another perspective on this issue that suddenly occurred. It's got me scratching my head as well as a colleague of mine. So, here's the scenario...
 I've got about 20 Adtran Netvantas situated through my network. My admin AD account creds work just fine in all of them. In each switch, there's a local "sadmin" user created that has worked fine up until last night. 
 I was in a new switch last night using "sadmin" getting ready to config RADIUS on it and suddenly my sadmin account failed on me when I had to SSH back in. Strangely enough, I then discovered that the "sadmin" creds failed on all my switches. This account is not an AD account, so that's why it's got us puzzled... 
 service password-encryption
 !
 username "sadmin" password encrypted "2e225c6676944cbfe03d03126a45db4dbeae" 
 Any insight and/or suggestions as to why this suddenly happened across all my switches would be appreciated. TIA folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started a management gig at a K12 school and one of the items on my agenda is to modernise the switching within the school.
 Currently we are mostly Aruba switching with a mix of Cisco switches in nodes around the school. Our core switch is Cisco however most of our major nodes are Aruba.
 So here is the issue; our state govsrment is overhauling our wireless and providing a replacement for every wireless access point and these will ALL be cisco as well as a Cisco WLC. 
 I would like to start using smart monitoring software like Juniper Mist, Cisco DNS or HP Airwave but I am under the assumption that we everything will need to be the same vendor for this to be clean and effective.
 The other issue is that the team im not leading has very limited switching experience and in order to Change that I'd like to get them used to a specific vendors way of doing something first.
 Has anyone got any advice on which vendor to go with for switching? Do I have a problem if I mix switches and want to use the software? Or am I making this a bigger issue than it needs to be.
 So to sum up I am considering: CISCO HP Aruba JUNIPER UBIQUITI 
 NOTE: Assume budget is no issue and we are just aiming for the best possible setup.

 All other users are on Teams and it's working good for them.
 The problems we currently have is that overall, the switchboard solution doesn't know anything about users on Teams ; it doesn't know if they are on call, away or simply offline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, we currently use Observium at my workplace, but it's not working as it used to. The owner doesn't care about the community version anymore (which is understandable, it doesn't pay his bills, I guess). Is there a better alternative (open source)? I've read LibreNMS, and Prometheus are alternatives. What can you guys recommend (long-term)? We also run smokeping. I appreciate any help you can provide.

So far I'm not sure if it's my ISP or the router but it constantly seems like there's too much going on and instantly sort of reboots itself. I have x2 POS systems and 1 sort of POS its a self order kiosk. These are all hard wired and I have an extender converted into an AP hard wired as well. A pc that's connected wireless ly, I want to connect my TV In the dinner area but when I do it slows our POS card payments. Any help/ would be greatly appreciated. 🙏

Something people will look at and stop to ask about. 
 I already have Sonic Wall's live attack map in my rotation. This is the best looking I've found so far, but I'm looking for a few more and perhaps something other than attacks. Got any good ones you like to check out?

 The problem is that we peer with one of Spectrums regional ASs, 10796, vs their 'backbone' Charter AS7483. In this case, many would be preferred routes are now an additional AS away. 
 Is it possible to strip AS10796 out of the routes which also have AS7483 so that I can install them with one less AS in the path? Has anyone done this or does anyone have any experience with a similar scenario?
 Thanks!

 We have a full SDA Fabric (45 sites). We're currently running C9300-24p for the Border/Control (Its really a FiB). Anyways we will be switching to C9300-48-UHX for wifi 6 reasons (along with mgig capabilities). 
 My main concern is, are we going to have to completely tear down the Fabric site and essentially rebuild each site from scratch? 
 I know in the past we have replaced switches with the same model and that worked fine but I don't see using the "mark for replacement" feature working in this case. 
 Just seeing if anyone has gone through this yet at all. Posted in the cisco community forum a couple weeks ago but no responses yet there either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks, been lurking on this sub for a while but this is my first post.
 Been in a Network Engineer/Network Admin role for 3+ years. Mostly for smaller scale government networks. I've made it to the final round of interviews for a position as an MPLS engineer.
 I feel confident about some of the things they want, like L2 switching, L3 routing, OSPF/BGP and Cisco familiarity. The problem is that I haven't touched MPLS professionally in a while, and when I did it was on the customer end. The company I'm interviewing with is a provider. Aside from a core understanding of MPLS, I've also been told they're going to want to talk about: Segment Routing, Pseudowire, VRF, VPRN, VPLS, EVPN, 1588, and TWAMP. They've also mentioned the ISIS routing protocol which I'm not too familiar with.
 I understand the theory of MPLS and I've been individually researching these other topics. I was wondering if you guys know any solid video series, courses/labs, or books that would cover most or all of these things under the MPLS umbrella. The interview is next week so my aim is not to sound like a complete clown when I talk about MPLS. Any advice appreciated!

 Network for reference: (Edit: I tried to do spacing here but it didnt work. SW1 has SW 2 and 3 below. SW 2 has 4 and 5 below and SW3 has 6 and 7 below)
 SW1
 SW2 SW3
 SW4 SW5 SW6 SW7
 I am currently trying to gain insight in a network and to do that we are installing a sensor on SW1. We then used RSPAN get all traffic from all of the lower switches up to SW1 for the local SPAN. Currently SW6 and SW7 have remote VLAN 111 going to SW3. But once we try forwarding SW3 to SW1 using VLAN 111 it creates a loop and sends a copy back to SW6 and SW7 since the trunk allows the VLAN both ways.
 Any solutions to this issue?
 We are thinking of having RSPAN on SW4, 5, 6 and 7 use VLAN 111 and then configure RSPAN on SW2 and 3 to use VLAN 112 so that way the traffic is only able to go one direction. Not sure if this would work.
 Thanks all!

Today's theft is surprisingly early, so it must have been a boozy lunch. Because of this, I am going to have someone on our junior staff create a training session on how to avoid getting your shit stolen while having a drinking session after work. Back in my party days I used to hook the strap of my backpack through a part of the chair and never got my bag stolen. What kind of tips or funny ideas do you have for a presentation to help people avoid getting their shit stolen while their necking a handful of lagers back at the pub? We have a young party culture with a lot of remote travel/work with clients that pay VERY well, so the old school grizzled administrator answers about making them pay for it or not bring their laptops home won't be helpful.

 I have a quick question for those of you using Anyconnect VPN on ASA/FTD.
 When you upload Anyconnect images to the VPN appliance, do upload only the latest version that your company uses or all possible images that are present in your enviroment?
 Is there a reason to upload older versions on the firewall at all?
 Only thing I can think of is the recent bug in Anyconnect that triggers auto update even if it's disabled in the XML.
 Another reason could be related to XML scheme that might change some parameters between releases of the supplicant.

 Our ticket was escalated to the higher tier of support and they initially attempted to help. But once none of their recommendations worked, they said "Unfortunately your product version is no longer supported."
 I replied saying that can't possibly be true, as you all are still actively selling the product. So they backtrack and ask, "May I know proof of purchase?" To which I responded that we no longer have the receipt. But sent them the activation key, the email used to originally purchase the software, and a screenshot logged into said account on our registered products page.
 From here, they send, "Another user may be able to help you get an answer in one of the forums" to which they provide a link that just goes to their parent company's main page with no forums mentioned anywhere.
 So I inform them of this... and the response? "May I know proof of purchase" - same exact guy I have been speaking to this whole time. 
 I open a second ticket in an attempt to get a different technician. Specifically ask not to get "Mr. XYZ" and I end up back with him anyways. We have the exact same conversation mentioned above and this is a never ending loop. We got so frustrated we decided to say fuck that software and bought a similar one from a different vendor.
 TL:DR - Corel bought Roxio. Their support sucks dick for gas money, and then rides their bike.

 Though we feel WiFi should work here if implemented properly. What are the biggest issues to be weiry of? What would the challenges be when scaling up the number of clients in the future?

There are business policies that can be created on the CE, but not easy to find ranges that these CDNs use. Here is a few that I have seen

 When configuring Radius/User/Privileges, there is no option to set the privilege level of Radius users. When Radius users login, they have no privileges which makes the user basically useless.
 I've reached out to our account team and the manufacturer and they report that the underlying SDK doesn't allow for them to set the privilege level of Radius users and we would need to use TACACS.
 Surely this can't be the case. Radius authentication without the ability to use the Radius user? No VSA, template user, default privilege adjustment? I have to create a user locally before it can be useful?
 Somebody tell me this isn't true.

 ​
 The freezing is randomly, and it occurs randomly too.
 No firewall issues and nothing on the network was changed in these past months.
 All devices have the same firmware.
 As well we put couple of them on DC power and they still freeze.

 Anyone experienced that before?

My question is how would you bypass the authentication login screen for media devices that you can only enter the password. For example they have purchased media devices for online TV but with these devices you can only enter the WiFi password which obviously will not work.
 I've reached out the provider about the issue and they told me just open up the web browser on these media devices to authenticate which I keep telling them it doesn't work that way. Has anyone dealt with similar issue or this type of issues at all.
 Hopefully what I've stated makes sense if not I can re-try explaining to the best of my ability again.

I'm looking to take my networking skills and move towards network automation / DevOps role. Any tips or things to study to start to navigate towards that direction? I have device experience with bigger vendors already (Cisco, Juniper, Fortigate, Meraki & etc) so I'm ready a little familiar with Python via Cisco. Also, if there are any certs or things to better my resume, I'm always down to get more certs!
 A little history: Been in the network field 5+ yrs. I currently have CCTRS, CCNA & JNCIA. I learned deeper protocols and Troubleshooting working for an ISP then moving to this MSP got more advanced with firewalls and internal routing protocols. I was considering getting the Cisco DevNet then continuing to CCNP vía that route but I heard it doesn't hold much weight in careers right now. 
 Any advice is beneficial! Thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has me looking into and meeting with Front App. We are a logistics company and the volume of email we get is tremendous, we receive around 100k emails a day for a 150 person company. A lot of it is emails going to multiple people because of how teams and distribution groups are setup.
 I have sent out training to users on how to create rules and manage the volume of mail with retention policies and even showing them how they can bulk delete them selves online, but it seems to be getting too much and users aren't following direction. We have tried shared mailboxes for some teams, but due to the volume of mail and people accessing it, it tends to crash outlook and does more harm then good. 
 I have a meeting with Front's technical team, just want to know if anyone has tried to make the transition to a software like this and is there anything I am looking over? And or how have you overcome the problem of high volumes of email?
 Concerns I have:
  
We have around 1000 distribution groups which we would have to use Microsoft's SMTP settings for each distribution group and would be a manual setup for each. The other option is using Front and their servers and updating our SPF/DKIM records, though then Microsoft will then not have a record of those outbound emails.
 Adds another point of failure for email, as now if Front goes down everything will be forwarded to their system.
 Learning curve for end users, we would have to switch around 80% of our company to this.

 I have 4 users on Mac's that I need to export their mail from and then import that mail into their new email address which is a completely different domain name. If I'm remembering correctly, Mac can't export to PST and it's an OLM file (I think?) 
 User 1 = 48GB
 User 2 = 47GB
 User 3 = 20GB
 User 4 = 70GB (I thought 50gb was the max but here we are)
 Normally on a PC I would just export to PST and then import into their new account in Outlook. I feel like is outdated and there might be a different or better way to do this? I know PST's can get corrupted during the export/import process so this whole process feels fragile. 
 Any ideas, suggestions, tips or wild ass guesses are welcome. I've considered joining the French Foreign Legion to avoid this so that is always an option. 
 Thank you!

 I'm going to be sitting in for an interview (virtual) in a few hours and I'm pretty nervous.
 It's for a Network Computer Support Technician position.
 Here are some of the PD:
 The Tier 1 maintenance of the on-site ADCS systems and subsystems, performing preventive and corrective maintenance and monitoring the on-site and remote locations. 
 Operations and maintenance of communications/computer systems and networks.
 Installs communications/computer systems in accordance with the respective installation spec.
 Troubleshooting and support of communications systems/networks.
 Working knowledge of Cisco system support/maintenance, VMware ESXi system support/maintenance, Active Directory, Windows Server 2019, HBSS, ACAS, SQL, SolarWinds, and Splunk preferred.
 Terminate ADCS circuits activated at the node point-of-presence (POP).
 I have my Net+ and Sec+ but not much experience other than doing some A+ stuff at a small PC shop in highshcool
 Any tips for the interview would be greatly appreciated!

We've considered both PIN verification at the printer's display panel, or badge scanning.
 Those of you who have set this up, what method are you using and what were the hardware requirements. Are you using a print server, and if so, what software are you running and is it on-prem or cloud based? If you're using badge scanning, what model of scanner are you using?

There is considerable traffic coming from 192.168.20.200 (remote site) going to 192.168.30.10 (local site) never being logged. I am seeing local traffic of 192.168.30.10 and 192.168.31.22 .

 I know that there is a thing called DNS policies, but I'm not sure if this would actually help in this case.

Computers with Windows OS use Anyconnect supplicant and it works good. But problem is with MacOSX. Anyconnect supplicant is not supporting this system so we need to use built-in supplicant. We try as below:
  
Machine certificate on MacOSX, but by default, iOS and macOS supplicants use the certificate identity common name for the EAP Response Identity it sends to the RADIUS server during 802.1X negotiation. So we get host name as a username - ISE can't find this username and rejecting connection.
 User certificate on MacOSX, but we get error: "EAP-TLS failed SSL/TLS handshake because of an unsupported certificate in the client certificate chain". Enhanced-Key-Usage is "client authentication" because I found that "all purpose" can be blocked.
  
Do you have any idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow Sysadmins,
 I would like to take a moment to address all the hardworking Admins and System Engineers who may have faced moments of intense stress while working on critical infrastructure. I want to extend my apologies for potentially wasting your time, but I felt it was important to reach out and share my recent experience.
 Recently, I was working on our ESXi cluster and FC Fabric to add another storage system.
 I had to reload the FC zone, and despite knowing that the other switch should carry the load, the system briefly halted, causing me great concern. My heart raced as I feared the worst, but fortunately, the failover worked as expected.
 I understand that moments like these can be incredibly stressful and can take a toll on one's mental and emotional well-being. I empathize with anyone who has experienced similar situations and want you to know that you are not alone. Let's continue to support each other and work together to ensure that our critical systems remain stable and secure.
 Thank you for all the hard work that you do, and I wish you all the best.

 I used to work in a ~120 heads high tech/cloud computing/manufacturing/ex Start Up (still behaving like one) company in an 1,5 head internal IT department (Doing everything but working on our actual products). Me being the 1 fully busy head.
 Got a support call from a senior cloud engineer [second year in cloud, plus maybe 5 in analytics experience ontop] (Working on the actual product). User needed help setting up new desk, new dock, monitors and all that.
 "Hey, could you please help me? My screens are all kinda messed up. The right one shows the same as the left one..." I right click, open screen settings, change to extended and arrange the screens. "Wow, that was easy. Thanks for showing me yada yada .."
 How dafuq can such a person manage to complete a bachelor's degree in IT?! 
 Imagine them standing in front of the committee of IT Professors, trying to defend their thesis and going: "Hmm, the beamer throws my Power Point notes on the wall, it's not supposed to do that. Could you please call IT support?"
 And the Prof.: "Sure no problemo, let's call them and wait a fucking eternity until they come in and fix this damn beamer. Back in the old days we used overhead Projectors were it was impossible to paste the notes on the wall, because who would be so stupid to print them on the same piece of foil as the presentation. The good old times, am I right?"
 I myself am only working ~6 years in IT (3 years apprenticeship[Ausbildung in Germany], 3 years hands on). But I notice with a lot of new graduate IT colleagues comming from university, their basic skills are just non existent.
 A friend of mine seriously tried to buy network HUBs in his company, because he learned in university that those can transmit data way faster because of the lack of overhead. He got really upset that you can no longer buy those. o_O

 I'm pretty new to Sharepoint (overall not super used to m365) so I'm at a bit of a loss here. Does anyone have any experience with this and could point me in the right direction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, let me apologize if this is supposed to be something basic to ask but I can't figure out where I can find the right settings. 
 We have started deployment of HP thin clients in our environment and now getting started testing out HP Device Manager. Initially, I installed HP Device Manager on my PC and discovered the thin clients on the network. Now I have installed the HP Device Manager on the server and was also able to discover the same thin client devices from the new server and able to push settings to the thin clients without issue.
 ​
 I am wondering if there is a settings somewhere that once an HP thin client has been discovered and configured, it will only access connections from a sort of "approved HP Device Manager server" and allow it settings to be change when some sort of authentication is done.
 ​
 In terms of security, there is firewall between server subnet and think client subnet that can block unwanted traffic but the issue lies that, in the current state, device on the same broadcast network as the thin client are able to discover the think client.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions and solutions.

 I have 2 job opportunity´s who have offered basically the same salary package. Both work places are 30 minutes away and one has 30 somewhat employees and the other 10.
 One workplace wants me to manage their private cloud which hosts applications and is used across the world. However they only use open source (proxmox, proxmox backup, local emailservers (cant remember the name), nothing in Azure, no m365, only old generation hardware) and windows services (ad, iis, rdp sessions, ...) for clustering and redundancy.
 The other workplace also wants me to manage their datacenter, but mostly go on projects to customers to replace firewalls, servers, storage, migrate AD etc... and uses industry standards (azure, m365, hpe, vmware, hyperv,...) however they are a small company and are less visible in the community. They also have an older standards of the workplace (fixed hours, no remote work) 
 Ive recently been studying and certificating in azure and vmware, and it seems a waste should i choose company 1. Im sure i can get the datacenter migraties to azure and vmware in the future but then ill be working with non industry standards (in my region at least) for at least a couple years. It will be challenging and ill definetly have freedom, but will not gain experience in hardware or cloud technology.
 Company 2 seems a better fit regarding my study and experience, but I fear being invisible in the community.
 Based on this, what option would you go for? I currently work somewhere with a 1 to 2 hour drive so they are tempting offers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys
 I have a Lenovo Think System T250 standalone server with Windows Server 2019 that has suddenly become slow. I highly suspect that it is the operating system volume drives (RAID 1, 2 drives) that are causing the issue as performance monitor is detecting high I/O and all else appears fine. There are C and D volumes, each with 2 drives in RAID 1. I plan on replacing the drives volume C with ones with same capacity and higher read/write speeds.
 ​
 What would be the best way to go about changing these drives?
  
Shutting down server, replacing 1 of the drives and starting backup, let it rebuild then do same with second drive.
  
2.Taking image backup of Volume C, shutting down, taking both drives out and replacing with new ones and recover from the image backup with bootable flash drive. Would this cause issue with volume D?
 Or any other suggestions would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am currently developing a multiplayer video game that will be using UDP P2P and I wish to use hole/nat punching to solve the issue with users not having to configure their router ports and/or network settings.
 I've managed to set up a system with a middle hand server that introduces users to each other (I believe it is called a STUN server?). Each user connects to this and a user (client) can request to be matched with another user (host). If a suitable host is found, the host is notified of the client and vice versa, they then start punching each other. This setup seems to work as intended, for most cases at least...
 The problem I am facing is in the case that the hosting user is on a non-public ip adress. The "handshake" via hole punching does not seem to get confirmed and the connection fails.
 Is there some kind of way to solve this issue? A relay server is not really part of the plan as it includes additional latency and costs.
 ​
 Edit: or could this issue not be related to the IP being private and instead be a router issue?

 I end up in systemd networking, netplan, etc/network/interfaces, configuring interfaces manually. Would there be a way I could have a docker container to consolidate this and point applications to a local subnet 127.0.100.1 or 127.0.200.1 and it would have within the container NAT database for mangling those to send over tunnel before the open internet.
 Would I be able to accomplish something similar to this in docker when I would give each application machines a /29 or /28 for multiple addresses it needs to reference and translate?

 the ISR1111 is the default gateway for the production network as x.x.x.1/29 on G0/0/1
 The WAN is connected via G0/0/0
 there is a firewall between the production network at x.x.x.2/29
 The ISR1111 happens to also have 8 switch ports off to the side at G0/1/x
 I have a test firewall plugged into the ISR at G0/1/0 with x.x.x.3/29 & GW: x.x.x.1
 I've seen mention of creating a vlan & SVI and ip add x.x.x.4/29, then assigning G0/1/0 to access that vlan
 But would that get traffic routing from a public IP? or would this method only work if the VLAN was a private address and NAT was enabled?
 Are we just missing an ip route from x.x.x.4 to x.x.x.2?
 Unfortunately my layer 3/routing knowledge is lackluster and I feel I'm beating my head against a wall on this one.
 There's a support ticket in with the ISP to config their equipment, but I'm trying to understand what would be needed in this scenario and, I don't have access to an ISR image to lab it.
 EDIT: I should add, I haven't found a router image in my lab that has a layer 2 only add-in card

 Currently working on a project. We are configuring two Core Switches to be in HSRP configuration.
 We have a single ASA right before it hits our router. Currently this ASA has routes configured to forward traffic to our Core Switch 1. Does this ASA need configurations that will point traffic to Core Switch 2? Or, because the two Core Switches share a virtual IP for a gateway, ASA doesn't need any additional configuration?

 We are struggling to decide the best course of action for 900+ users. I believe we will not be using FIDO2 at this time so our only options are Enroll on Behalf Of for every single user and manually map the cert to their ADuser or send the Yubikeys out and have the users use Self Enrollment. Also we would like these to autorenew every 1-2 years (still deciding on timeframe) but I haven't come across a way for the cert to renew and get updated on the Yubikey itself, only a way for the user themselves to renew and put on the Yubikey.
 Trying to get ideas from people that currently use Yubikey and determine the best route forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello networking friends. Looking for opinions on design. Quick overview of what the campus looks like now then i’ll lead to my question.
 Currently the campus has a pair of HA Palo Alto’s. They lead down to two cores which are Nexus 7706s. The two cores feed roughly 40 building totaling to 118 closets.
 The cores are in VDCs. One VDC on each core is for the buildings described above (call it the staff vdc). This VDC has L3 connectivity to the other VDC for the data center. 
 A majority of L3 default gateways live at the distribution layer for the staff vdc and most L3 gateways for DC vlans live in the data center core.
 The team is being tasked with segmenting traffic.
 Would you all migrate L3 gateways to the PANs to zone them or would you VRF and leave the L3s where they are? The vrfs could match zone names going forward What’s the industry standard for this ? Is there another option i’m totally missing?
 Thoughts and opinions appreciated!

After that, my inbox started filling with replies to that previously deleted message. Apparently, some wonderful person mistakenly sent this email to multiple company-wide distribution lists. For the next several hours, I'm deleting emails of people in the company that are either asking to be removed from the lists, demands for people to stop hitting reply to all, or the occasional taco recipe (I guess some users are trying to be comedians). <sarcasm>Luckily, I didn't have a ton of other work that I needed to do today, so I had plenty of time to spend deleting emails, while trying not to miss emails I actually needed to see.</sarcasm>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting ready to place the bid on my second networking job that I will be doing in an RV park.
 The park has about 70 available slots for RVs/campers. Each location has an outdoor weather protected power outlet that I could use for a POE. 
 Several of the RV locations also have existing coax and conduit all ran to one central location that I can utilize as a hub for a switch and place access points in several locations.
 However I also noticed that some of the coax was ran to the point of service for our ISP near a pole and would not be able to be utilized as I believe the drop belongs to them ( we work for the most of thel isps).
 I'm looking for a recommendation on some ubiquity equipment that could be both hardwired and wirelessly bridged for setting up one large or several small mesh networks.
 I'll also take any advice anyone else has here on formats of asking questions for my post or any job tips.
 I'm sure I could wear my way through it on my own but I would love to hear from somebody who's done more than one.
 Most of the networking experience I do have has been just simply running CAT5 and commercial buildings and setting up a simple switch, point to point radios and serval years trouble shooting internet, phone lines and simple wifi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone reading had any experience with using either netbox or nautobot as a source of truth to feed into an automation orchestration system like Ansible specifically for standing up EVPN VXLAN symmetric IRB fabric data centers? There are a lot of unique data point relationships that the data models don't handle out of the box. There are some free plugins, but nothing substantial without doing some significant customization it seems. For example, with a pool of VLANs which fabric VRF are each of the VLANs present in? Or which vlan is used for the IBGP peering within a fabric VRF? Which loopback is the SNAT interface for that VRF? These relationships can be made in static VAR files, but we're trying not to do that and use a dynamic source for inventory and variables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I posted here recently about issues we are having where AD users are getting locked out by the Exchange Server. Things have evolved a little and I am certain the lockouts are coming from Exchange, but I have looked through every Exchange/IIS log I can find and I am unable to find corresponding attempts to access these users' mailboxes. 
 I finally enlisted Microsoft Support after reaching my wits end with this issue and dropped the $500 on a ticket. After a day and a half of intermittently working with them to investigate the issue, they came to the conclusion that...the Exchange server was the source of the lockouts...
 They admitted that I knew that when I submitted the ticket, so they told me they were going to refund the cost of the ticket, but we need to reach out to premier support for a RCA (root cause analysis) as they had reached their limitations in assisting us (they didn't even get as far along as I did in my own investigating...). 
 So I reached out to premier support. Where I'm told you need a premier support contract to get support from them. That contract, I am told, starts at $53,000. $53,000 is what it would cost us to get support from Microsoft, on a Microsoft product, that we already pay heavily for for the "privilege" of using...
 Does this align with anybody else's experience? Are there any other options for us that don't involve spending $53,000? This just seems absolutely insane to me how useless they are in supporting their products!

Company is providing the devices because this person is important enough that we need them to be reachable and have access to company data. Because these are manager types we haven't really put any restrictions on the phones, the MDM/DEP at this point is just so we can remote wipe or recover PIN after someone is let go. We push one or two LoB apps but they can install whatever apps they want. A few have a separate personal phone but most use the company phone as their only phone, which means all sorts of random apps installed. It's interesting to me to see what kinds of apps people have so I look occasionally. Turns out 27 of them have TikTok. 
 So, to block or not to block. That is the question....
 We're in manufacturing and don't really have any particularly special IP if that makes a difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to see if anyone has ever seen similar issues before. A few weeks ago, we started noticing random switchports on the network in various locations in many different L2 domains learning hundreds of mac address on access ports. My initial thought was obviously some time of switching loop. Fast forward a few days, we start seeing the same behavior on multiple (50-100) ports throughout the network. The only commonality between these ports are that they all have a USB-C style docking station attached to them with a laptop. Port-security is helping stop the mac-addresses from overloading, but I'm curious if anyone has ever ran into something like this? We have tried updating the drivers on the docking station with no avail. Some ports are learning almost a mac-address/second. The mac-addresses seem to be totally random as well. When looking up the OUI, many come back with nothing. Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey I have a specific question that has to do with someone at my job. So we currently have a guy who holds numerous hats in our IT department (sys admin, network admin, security admin and more) my thing is he is trying to gate keep a lot of roles and does not want anyone else (new sys admin, and service desk guys) to have access to certain things like AD, servers, network monitoring tools etc. He’s been here longer than our manager so I believe he makes alot of his own decisions based off his ease of use and comfort which imo should not be the case especially if he is implementing security processes. I feel there would be a lack of true security if it is mainly just benefiting him rather than the company. With that being said I believe we should hire a IT security guy to audit/ work with us but work on a different team. I thought this would be a standard thing but it seems like it’s not am I wrong for thinking this way? Should there not be a IT security guy.

In my experience, BGP works much more like an application than a routing protocol so I’m not anticipating any practical difference from managing the v4 table other than the potential size. I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice or can offer any foresight into this.

 TAC recommended to upgrade both of these to 9.3(11) as this one has patch for both the bugs ( allegedly ) and we could not verify the claim.

 Do any one from our community has faced this issue and should I take word of tac for granted as they are not sharing the documentation which says the patch has fixed both the bugs?

 My networking knowledge is limited,therefore don’t shoot the pianist!
 I have been managing a small school network with 300 hundreds users split by staff,students and guests. 3 VLANs, 3 SSIDs, Core, Staff & Guests. Firewall policies built accordingly. 1 extra VLAN for shared printers.
 We’re now moving to a newer site, 900 users. New network devices.
 I have read about some brands supporting one SSID to multiple VLANs, using RADIUS authentication.
 How does this work, is it a good setup,what pitfalls one should expect? Major points of failure? Performance thoughts worth to mention?

 I currently work IT at a small / local bank with main building and a single remote branch in the same town. We connect to our primary financial vendor internal networks via an MPLS router at the main building (there's also a secondary VPN router for fail-over and we're routing certain traffic to a virtual IP but MPLS is the primary route) - just referring to it as the "FI gateway". Then, there are static routes set up in our firewall which route traffic for certain IP's and networks used by bank apps through that FI gateway.
 For the remote branch building, it is connected to the main branch via site-to-site VPN tunnel and the bank apps used there have their traffic routed back to the …]]></summary>

We have a 9800wlc which is just buggy as hell and has been a nightmare so far as we've had issues with phones not been able to connect to the Cisco aironet aps and just general wifi issues.
 It's not like we will replace the wlc as we just replaced our old 5508 with this 9800 but yeah just thinking of a scenario where if we would replace it with Aruba stuff then how would it mesh with the Cisco stuff.
 And I asked about Aruba because I know that Aruba aps and wlcs are better than their Cisco equivalents.
 Thank you.

They aren't very tech savvy so If i ask "What's not working or loading?" the response is always something along the lines of everything. They can't tell me if it's a windows issue or an issue with the browser or website they are trying to use, but granted in some cases I do come to a users machine that take forever to even click the windows start bar or launch an application. I was looking at task manager on one the other day and the CPU and RAM were clocked out from either two tabs of chrome or applications that shouldn't be running. 
 I know this is a common thing when it comes to IT work, but I just wanted to get some advice on what I could do to at least make them think the computer is speeding up or actually help that one employee who is actually having the issues. I'm quite new to IT work especially being the only Tech so I guess an Admin. Any advice or tools that I could utizilize would be greatly appreaciated. 
 I already run ccleaner and Malwarebytes and then uninstall any programs that shouldn't be there, even though we have endpoint running on all our pc's for viruses but it doesn't cause issues unless an update or scan is being performed. 
 Thanks for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, does the notes I've made below (along with the one question too) sound about right when describing active vs passive authentication? Let's assume the firewall I mentioned to is a Firepower device too (not that it would matter anyway)
 Active authentication actively prompts the user to sign in before they try and access a website and then after that it will go through the access policy to see if that user account matches any rules for that username for them to be able to access a particular website. You can specify what managed device (computer/vm) you want the user to see this authentication prompt on when they try and access the internet. When it says authentication method is HTTP basic, what does that mean? Does it mean that the device (firewall) will open a port 80 connection with the domain controller to check to see if the users entreded creds are correct and then authenticate the user? 
 Passive authentication won't prompt the user when they're on a device and will instead check ISE (which is acting as the user agent) to tell ISE to go and check AD for the ip to user and group mappings for the account that is presented to ISE and then retrieves that info from the DC's and builds the connection logs out also uses that information to then go through the access policies and check to see if any rules are hit too 
 These 2 authentication methods only work with 80/443 traffic

 I feel like the whole intune interface is like those phones for kids, there’s buttons and options but none do anything because Microsoft knows best.
 Get intune they said…it’ll be fun they said.
 Update: While most comments point to a missconfiguration, which I truly believed as well for a while, I'm still scratching my head as to why this happened in the past couple of days.
 Even so, I can understand that we missed something, but that begs the question, why would this be buried in some obscure settings.
 We have one policy in "Update rings for Windows 10 and later" with an Update Ring Settings "Upgrade Windows 10 devices to Latest Windows 11 release" clearly set to "No" and clearly correctly applying to all corporate devices. This has worked great since Windows 11 released 1 year ago almost, yet today, out of the F*IN blue, without anyone editing anything have I mentioned that?
 Note to self, do not post anything without fully accepting blame, in writing, even if flared as rant.

 Hey, I just wanted to thank everyone for their amazing advice on my last post. Your expertise and kind words helped me take action and improve my situation. Some of you even reached out to me in private to help me out with writing a CV, Configuring the network, fixing the VMware issues and so on, so i feel like i owe you guys an update. 
 I compiled all the evidence I had of rude and stressful interactions with users and wrote out my account of the situation from memory. Then, I printed everything out and went to speak with my workplace leadership. I was acutally shaking so much you could hear the paper move LMAO, but I explained in detail how a certain boss treated me, including how he asked me to break the law to get something he wanted (I had email evidence), and how much it stressed me out when he would be angry that i didn't follow through. I also explained how this workload was too much for one person to carry, and the person I spoke with took me seriously, and I was put on sick leave with pay until I can see a doctor. They're launching an investigation into that boss starting from the very top, and addressing the rotten workplace culture in a discrete manner.
 I have a doctor's appointment on Monday, and I'll most likely get a mental health sick note to take some time off. As for the job interview I mentioned, it didn't work out because I didn't have some Office 365 Certs :D but at least I have time now to look for something better! Also, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW ULTRA CORPORATE THAT PLACE WAS, It almot felt like a cult where everyone was one "giant happy family"! 
 Once again, thank you all for your support and advice. I truly appreciate it and feel like I've played my cards right to improve my situation.

 We are out of ideas. There is no discernible difference between the users or computers. Tried a lot of different things, for example:
 Made sure the sites were in Trusted Sites. Checked if it's a TLS issue. Gone over Defender timeline to see if anything different is there. Compared OS versions. Checked Sharepoint logs. Checked IIS logs.
 The list goes on. Is there anyone here who has had this issue?

 everything worked perfectly fine and I can see all the data in the new installation, however, noticed that the main search function (all the way top)no longer works for the items that got migrated to the new system, I can manually go to the site/devices and see those. but not using the search option.
 but if I add new items to the netbox, only for those items, the search functionality works as expected.
 For example, suppose I had 10.100.1.1 in the old db, and I added 10.100.1.2 to netbox. 
 When I search with 10.100. in the top search bar, it will now show only 10.100.1.2 which was added newly, not the migrated data.
 Did anyone know how to fix this?
 how to reproduce the issue?
  
Deploy netbox following the official doc in new env.
 dump the database on the old netbox machine.
 migrate the database following the article.
 And search for the items in the migrated db.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, change in management has led to a change in ideology for naming endpoint computers.
 I prefer to just use the device serial number (usually a Dell TAG so 7 characters). new boss wants [unit]-[initial][surname] (e.g. COY-KSmith) type host names. FWIW we had 3 Kevin Smiths at one point. 
 I prefer the abstracted and unique option, mostly for simplicity as the name is printed on the device by the manufacturer. He prefers the generated name so it's easy to guess what a user's computer is called. 
 We are using SCCM so I feel it's easy enough to get to the host via the username, plus I see no benefit with adding a manual tier to this process that will need maintenance if a laptop is reassigned, or replaced. 
 I'm interested to know what does the community think about this? not so much a what do you do questions, we all have our systems that we just do because we've always done it this way, but if you think about it as a green field exercise, what seems reasonable? My issue is I can see his point, and there are some merits to it, but not enough IMO.

 I think I'd need a test group of clients for receiving the updates first. Then, after a period of time, I'd approve these updates to all production clients.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a series of comments (that I can’t find with Search) discussing whether RAID alone can be considered HA. Some said Yes by confining the scope of the analysis to the drives.
 Others pointed out that a single RAID controller or power supply failure would defeat the HA nature of the RAID drives.
 Wikipedia states:
 There are three principles of systems design in reliability engineering which can help achieve high availability.
 Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding or building redundancy into the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system. Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure. Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover. Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure – but the maintenance activity must. ....
 It strikes me that there is an important distinction between having some redundant components and having no single point of failure.
 I can see that RAID alone has good capacity to improve availability, but I wouldn’t say RAID is HA. What’s your view?
 Edit: good replaces limited

 But first of first, why? What's the deal with Microsoft delaying this key security upgrade? Why are they pushing it back so far? 
 But I guess the delay might be to give organizations enough time to switch over to using number match for Microsoft Authenticator with push notifications. This is a big deal because it adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to confirm their sign-in attempts with an additional secured factor. Plus, the delay will give organizations a chance to properly test and set up their MFA policies, so they won't cause any issues!

 Hello all, Im a little bit confused looking around at the switches there seem to be so many choices!
 I am working on a project at work, i've asked our IT to give me a hand but they are incredibly busy right now so unlikely to have a response from them for a couple of days.
 Ideally i would like to make my purchases today so I could have them from next week.
 I'm trying to run a project that will take a 10GB ethernet cable from a server PC.
 This will need to go to a switch that can output to 20 other connected devices.
 These connected devices dont need to be 10gb, so 1gb is fine.
 I keep on coming across devices that have a 10gb fiber connection. and I see you can get adaptors for these ports but most of them are saying adaptor for "insert switch manufacture", is this a marketing gimmick or is there something that stops them from working with other switch manufacturers?
 ​
 Would some be able to recomend a switch that would work for this?
 ​
 I will need to connect up to 40 devices to this Server but is has a 4 port 10gb switch output so if it makes more economical sense I am happy to get smaller switches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Just wondering if I am missing something. Looking at options to add a GPU to improve performance on our Remote Desktop Session Hosts. Currently all RDSH Servers are VMs Virtualized using Hyper-V as the Hypervisor.
 By the looks of it I need a Enterprise NVidia GPU that is compatible with the Server (Dell PowerEdge R640 for example can support an NVIDIA T4 GPU).
 However reading online, Microsoft have removed vGPU / RemoteFX Support from Windows Server 2016 Build 1084. So this is a no go.
 I think I need the following:
 > An Enterprise Driver License from NVidia
 > A physical GPU installed in a Server, for example the NVIDIA T4
 > A Hypervisor that supports vGPU
 Looking on the NVidia Website, it looks like this is only supported using the following Hypervisors:
 > VMWare vSphere
 > Citrix Hypervisor 8.4
 Both of the above Hypervisors are incredibly expensive in terms of licensing. If I use what I currently have (Hyper-V - Server 2019) this would not allow vGPU or Remote FX, but would only allow physical mapping, so 1 x Physical GPU directly mapped using DDA to the Guest VM RDSH.
 Am I missing something here, how are other enterprises adding Shared vGPUs to their Virtualised RDSH VMs to improve performance? Or is this exactly why VMWare / Citrix are still in business?

In trials we noticed in bigger companies, that due to network restrictions, the connection to a turn server didn't always work. what would be a good way to find out what a network-client can do in a network? stuff like: which ports can be "addressed" / can i reach ports on my server from within the company network? Turn uses 3478 and 5349 for signalling, but also also a wide range (49152-65535) for media streams. 
 Yes, i'm aware that the cleanest way is to ask IT, but that usually takes time and triggers a lot of unnecessary back and forth for a demo run.

 On Ripe I see this for the IP block descr: Level 3 NL RIPE block.
 Why is there a discrepancy between different IP lookup tools?

After thinking a bit more, I think at least Ansible is out of the question, because I cannot boot off from the local harddrive, when I want to write an image to that same harddrive. So it needs network boot or boot from USB (which is the same as over network with an IPMI-solution and a simulated virtual flash drive attached)... What would you suggest for automatic restoring something like a clone-zilla backup image?

Since they are my web applications, it is my job to ensure the servers stay updated and our wildcard certificates are installed.
 I didn’t really know what to do or how to do it so I kind of just guessed. I had the certificate file and the PFX file (assuming this was the key.) I double-clicked the PFX, put in the password, and it installed. I bound it in IIS with the correct Site and it looked like it worked! Hooray, lol.
 But when I looked into it further I noticed it installed the certificate under the Personal folder. I also noticed there were plenty of other certificate stores/folders in the CertMgr. 
 So my question is, what do these other folders entail? Are they simply just for organization or does each folder hold a different set of policies/security so it truly does matter where the certificate is installed to? 
 I tried Google and it led me to another post in this sub, but it only confused me more lol. Any help would be appreciated or if you can point me in the right direction that would be great!

 So I've been working as a Linux administrator so far (around 2 years) and was offered a position called "IT Application Administrator"
 The IT team member emphasised the word "Application". The role will involve setting up applications on Linux servers e.g. setting up a Web server, configurations, installing the application, some security and testing stuff etc. "Plan-build-run". 
 Ansible will be used for automation. Maybe some shell scripting. I will obviously be using the command line a lot.
 The part that I won't be doing is actually creating the VM/setting up the server and I probably won't be monitoring the infrastructure. 
 Even then, this seems like a Linux role to me? I asked him and he seemed hesitant to call it that.

 I'm currently stuck with the following problem:
 Environment:
 - RDS-Farm (Gateways, Connection Broker, Session Hosts - all W2019 Servers)
 - the RDP-Connection is triggered via the RDP-File downloaded from RDWeb-Page
 ​
 Problem:
 - I start RDP-File in my W11 client, enter the credentials (MFA is also triggered) and the logon works 
 - I start RDP-File #2 (different Username) and the Username from the first connection is the default value. I change to "user different account", enter the second credentials but the MFA is still triggered with the account of the first session.
 ​
 Ho do i get W11 to ALWAYS use the provided username/password? It seems, that there's some kind of cache or something that.
 ​
 I hope the explanation is understandable :-)
 ​
 any tipps would be appreciated.

 thx and cheers from austria

I wanted to alert other candidates about the red flags I found during the hiring process. However, the company somehow managed to trace the review back to me, and I have no idea how they did it.
 To be honest, I'm not even scared or intimidated that they found out it was me behind the review. I've been job searching since I got laid off, and I don't care about burning bridges at this point. Companies already burn bridges with their bad treatment and terrible hiring processes, treating employees and job candidates as disposable assets.
 The hiring manager even sent me an email to schedule a call with him to clarify some of the points I made in my review and to see if there's a job opportunity for me. But I've been burned by corporate so many times that I have serious trust issues with companies. At this point in my life, I don't believe anything that comes from them, especially if they start dangling carrots in front of me.
 I admit, I'm curious to know how they traced the review back to me, but I'm not willing to risk my privacy to find out. I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Glassdoor reviews being traced back to them. What are your thoughts on this situation? Should I take the call from the hiring manager, or is it not worth my time?
 I'm open to any honest feedback and opinions. Thanks for reading.

 I wanted to get the insight of some other people within the system administration field. What I'm looking to better understand is at what point does administration become engineering. Based on my experience the line is thin and dependent on the organization that you work for. The way I've reasoned this out in my head in the past is that administration is mainly monitoring/maintaining while engineering tends to be more focused on the planning/creation/building of infrastructure.
 It appears that a lot of employers tend to blur these lines. Though it could just be skewed perspective based on my experience. I'd like to have some idea of where this line is so that I can better educate and prepare myself when negotiating with my current employer and/or other potential employers.

 Now that the older devices are EOL, we can't get support (security updates, etc) any more so we need to recycle them.
 Any recommendations for how to do this? I see lots of things on the Cisco site about trade ins with purchase but nothing for just recycling.
 If there are any community minded businesses, the group is open to accepting donations of recent model "gently used" (within manufacturer's service life) equipment for the group's student run facility on the Eastern plains of Colorado.

This guy made this elaborate python "thing" to do some stuff on excel. I was both impressed and horrified. The "helpful guy" was rather sad that I solved the requirements in three hours with VBA and significantly less lines of code.
 That got me thinking, how do others determine what solution set is best for a given requirement. My team has broad skills. For example I do powershell, VBA, HTML, CSS, Javascript and if I'm really pushed to it, .net. Others are equally diverse but we have a REST guy that consumes APPIs like candy. Got another in Microsoft power platform and on.
 So when we get a request, usually I can look at it and push it to the best solution based on my experience.
 How do others handle that?

 How can you verify identity with relying on security questions that they may forget anyway or asking them personal things that you shouldn’t have access to like DOB or last 4 of SSN or relying on the security of mobile phone numbers and SMS?

 I was hoping I could get some help with an issue, I've been voluntold to configure an IPSEC connection with a client and my networking experience is limited to a CCNA I did nearly a decade ago before being hired as a coder. So I'm getting out a brush and getting the rust off. 
 Anyways,
 I've gotta provide an Encryption Domain space for our end of the IPSEC connection. Would this be the address space attached to our 'outside' port 192.168.0.0/28 or the 'inside' port 192.168.2.0/28?
 I've been able to ascertain that the domain would be the address space meant to traverse the tunnel but I haven't found an answer as to which address space I should provide.
 Thanks in advance!

When the boxes come back up on the "new hardware", they're running weaker processors with slower memory. (Can't help but notice the price hasn't gone down to reflect this loss of power...) I've destroyed my personal systems and migrated to cheaper shared instances because "whatever", but at work, the new power differences between a few of my Docker Swarm worker nodes is creating imbalance where there was none before.
 Call my a cynic, but is this Akamai's influence bleeding in already? Seems pretty coincidental the big company comes in and suddenly my services are getting their corners cut off in a way that doesn't require them to lower vCPU or memory counts on their plans. Is this happening to anyone else?

 Last week we had a meeting to discuss the slowness issue of our app. Yes it has gotten considerably worse over the past six months. The three teams involved were county networking team, facility IT, contractor team, App Dev team. It took a meeting that also included all management inside the facility to complain about the app slowness and to get someone inside our facility to fix it. My facility managers arranged everything with the county network team, but I supplied IP addresses and the names of the users who were always complaining about slowness. I also showed the county network IT guys how users get on a fresh PC and how slow the app is. They agreed that there was a problem and worked their magic in the background.
 24 hours later users are experiencing a much better and faster virtual environment. They are thanking me left and right for fixing the issue, but all I did was complain to management every day for the past six months. Is this how it feels to be successful?

On core 1 I have configured SVI for each VLAN. I want a second core switch (Core 2) to be able to take/distribute load while acting like a backup switch if Core1 goes down. Each access switch should have a redundant link to both Core1 and Core2. What configuration/technology should I look into to help me accomplish the redundant core switch?
 One option I have looked at include HSRP but that seems to be only for routers and not for SVI interfaces. I have also looked at VSS but I lack the hardware to test this feature.

Here is the subscription in question:

 Spoke with AWS support and the basically said talk to cisco so here I am hoping someone can give me a straight answer on it. Can't seem to get anything concrete and cant talk with cisco support without having a subscription. Any help would be appreciated!

 We are currently running on proper enterprise gear like Cisco, PaloAlto, Fortinet, etc.

Even this simplest cheapest printer now requires an internet connection otherwise it will stop printing. As the toner runs low it try to connect to its supply services to prompt you to buy new tone at exorbitant prices.
 I keep telling users DO NOT buy HP printers but they are cheap because they make their money on consumables. They are now more trouble than they are worth. I've been installing printers from A4 to A0 LED and laser printers for 25 years and have come to the point that these printers are a waste of time and effort. Users end up paying more for support on these printers than the printers cost and is false economy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, i volunteer as a sysadmin for two non profit organizations. One of them just underwent a yearly audit, which, for the first time, included an IT audit. Note that this is an org with 12 staff, and no IT department. The single server is an Intel NUC, located in a wall mounted rack in the store room.
 I just got the report back, we failed on the following counts: 1. No penetration test done in the past 12 months. 2. Not enforcing 6 week password rotation (for local non admin accounts on their laptops) 3. No raised floors in the server room 4. No biometric security control for the server room 5. No aircon in the server room 6. Not encrypting off site backups 7. Running both windows 10 and windows 11 on the same network
 I now need to write a rebuttal to the auditors for this travesty of an audit.
 Wwyd
 Note, i love the organization, and they are not to bland
 Also note, this is in extremely rural Africa

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We have DBAs dumping Oracle RMAN backups to an NFS target. We need to replicate those backup files to a 2nd site. The storage devices at each site are different, so we need something that can do host-based replication.
 The RMAN backups are fulls each night, and looking for something smart enough to not send a full backup to the second site each time. I was looking at rsynch and it has a block level synch option, would that possibly work? 
 My main concerns are if the full RMAN dumps would trigger rsynch to send a full each time this won't work, but if it's smart enough to only send changed blocks each night this should be workable. The initial full will be the worst in terms of host impact and time, we will seed it locally if possible.
 Are there better tools for this type of host based copy approach? DBAs do not want a formal agent-based backup app, I understand there are better approaches. Dealing with what we have on hand right now and seeking feedback around rsynch or other 3rd party tools.
 Thank you!

 I'm trying to work on something using the API for Tanium. I see in their doc: Reference: API Gateway examples (tanium.com) that they share an example: "Perform an action operation (mutation.actionPerform)"
 I'm just wondering if anyone has translated this into a curl or powershell script?
 ​
 In the past, I've only worked with the query API, so something similar to:
 $h = blahblah
 { endpoints(filter: {op: CONTAINS, path: "name", value: "' + $h + '"}) { edges { node { id name domainName ipAddress lastLoggedInUser model manufacturer } } } }'
 ​
 I'm also wanting to target the endpoints: [ID!] field instead of platform (In the example). I'm not sure however, to piece together the chain: Get the ID, Pass the ID and Add Tag: XXX.
 ​
 If you have done, or similar examples, let me know please.

 With that said, I’m tasked with replacing our on premise PBX and have evaluated several service providers for this purpose.
 Current contenders include 8x8, RingCentral, GoTo, and Ultatel.
 I’ve been able to find the information I need to make an informed decision on each of those with the exception of Ultatel.
 Does anyone have experience with them? How did it go/ how is it going? Their pricing is very aggressive and solution appears to include all the features we need (our requirements for a phone system are pretty simple compared to most).

 The problem is that the provider assigns me a private IP and I set behind their small pool of public IPs hence no capability of reaching my NCR to watch the cameras.
 The only idea I've had so far is to bring up an L2TP to a third location which has a public IP and bounce my monitoring through there, but looks expensive and complicated.

 I have tried the 0365 reports script, but it only gets random meetings and nothing useful, even if I give it dates.
 My plan would be to:
  
Create alll meetings under a user
 Get all meetings for that user (they are available on Teams admin, power automate desktop might be a possibility to download them?)
 use a slightly modified script that we have to populate out attendance sheets.
  
Essentially, all it need to do is to automate getting the meeting attendance from team admin (I noticed that downloading the attendance register from teams itself sometimes fails, so I want something durable and the reports on Teams admin are simple and to the point) 
 Also, all the meetings are team meetings, so that is another limitation.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings my fellow networkers,
 I've discovered NeDi recently and I tried to set it up in our enterprise environment. I deployed it on a fresh VM with the latest Debian release (v11.6).
 I installed NeDi via the bash(version 2.2.22) I found on the website which works perfectly but I've been stuck on the RADIUS authentication. Problem is: There is not so much documentation about it and the community forum has its registration for new users currently disabled.
 I found this snippet of code in the nedi.conf file:
 # Authentication for GUI users can be set to: # local, sso, pam, radius, ldap or none # Append -pass to specify a password and optional CLI port for device access in Devices-Write (The GUI-username is used, if the User field is left empty) # Add 2nd argument with ldap or radius to assign groups to users which don't exist within NeDi (disabled if empty, minimal access with "usr,") # Be aware that ldap or radius may have problems with passwords containing language specific special characters #guiauth ldap usr,net,dsk,mon,oth, ;guiauth local # Override the Login and Logout URLs (e.g. for your SSO setup) # The defaults will be used if commented # Login URL Logout URL ;authurls User-Profile.php index.php # Set Radiusserver(s) parameters, if selected above # host port secret timeout retries ;radserver localhost 1812 testing123 2 1 
 It looks pretty straight forward but when I setup the "guiauth" variable to "radius" and configure the "host" and "secret" variable and try to connect to the GUI with one of my test users, I get an error 500 from the server saying that it can't handle the request.
 I've looked into my RADIUS server's logs (Cisco ISE) and I don't even see the request hitting the server.
 Am I missing something ? Also, does anyone know how to hash the secret so it doesn't appear in full text in the nedi.conf file ?
 Cheers to anyone that can help me!

I recently moved to Miami and got picked up by a very top shelf corporate company. It's one of the most sought out due to their benefits and I've heard other techs had to apply 17 times to get their jobs so I assumed I would be surrounded by the top of the top. Instead, it's been 4 months and I can confirm I'm surrounded by some of the laziest inept workers I have ever seen. No one wants to work, tickets are constantly needing to be reopened, users always complaining. Some techs even get written up several times a month but have still been with the company for 4 years because "they never fire".
 This is my first venture into Corporate IT for a large company of around 20,000 employees but I already feel like 80% of the IT department are milking checks. Is this the same across the majority of big companies like this? Should I bother staying with them if i spend more time patching up others mistakes rather than learning something new? I will admit that there are definetly career oppurtunies as most people working in IT support here are so bad my manager has considered making me a IT Tech Tier III Lead but my past jobs would have pinned me as Tier 1.5-2 in skill (fake it till you make it lol)

 I'm working on a small productivity tool and I want to wrap it up nicely for distribution, but figuring out the best practice for today is really tricky!
 The tool is installed per-user, and it sets up a couple of file associations and global hotkeys. In principle I could do all of that programmatically within the application, and simply distribute it as a standalone exe. Would an MSI/App-V/MSIX container be preferable to that? And what should it contain?
 Curious to hear what it's like from a sysadmins perspective :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a subscriber to the Rackspace hosted Exchange service. They started having downtime on Friday, December 2nd at 2 AM and by 6 AM on Saturday had revealed that they experienced a security incident. So I immediately switched off onto a CPanel account that I have just to get my email back up and running (it was just one email address). I finally got access to the restore of my PST file. So what I have is the following at this point: 
  
An 86 GB PST file with email from 2018 to December 2nd, 2022.
 Emails form December 3rd through today that I use WHM/Cpanel to host. It's Maildir format if that helps. I use Thunderbird to check it.
  
What I'd like to wind up with is getting onto Office 365 and import the PST file. That should be straightforward. However, how can I take the email from December 3rd until now and get that into Office 365? Perhaps I could setup a separate Outlook account with IMAP that pulls from my CPanel mail account and then just drag the emails from IMAP into my new Office 365 account?
 Or does anyone else have a suggestion on how I could accomplish this?
 Thanks,
 John

 Been a reader of this group for a long time and first time posting. Just looking for others that are in a similar situation as I am and how the F&*k you do it.
 A little about my situation: I’m a one-man IT shop. We have three main offices and a few satellite offices all connected through Meraki VPN tunnels. We have just over 400 employees/contractors.
 On-Site I have two Dell SAN’s, one for production and one for on-site backup. Seven ESXi hosts and ~33 Cisco switches. Cisco CUCM VoIP system and ~90 VM’s. A Synology for off-site backup.
 In the two other offices I have Dell R series servers, one for back up and one for production.
 Now down to the “meat and potatoes”. I do it all from on-boarding to off-boarding to keeping all the hosts, VM’s, switches and other hardware updated. I babysit employees/contractors everyday with the stupid things you read on here every day. I work 60-80 hours a week. In 2022 I worked every holiday there was. I used 7 hours of PTO time the whole year. I’m 59 years old and I’m tired. The kind of tired you can’t sleep off. (what is sleep?)
 Management refuses to let me hire someone experienced to help. (they let me hire a 17 y/o intern about a year ago) but he didn’t last.
 I make a little over $100K with a $13K bonus in 2022. There’s a ton more but that’s the gist of it.
 Opinions? Comments? Am I just plain stupid for putting up with this crap?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've reached a point of frustration on this one because I'm so close I can taste it, but I just can't quite get the last piece, and it's pissing me off.
 Using MECM to upgrade from older versions of Windows 10 to newer ones and we've got machines with Symantec Encryption Desktop (SED) on them.
 The task sequence does the following:
  
Stages SED files needed for whole disk encryption admin account to do its job.
 Copies files from above to admin account's profile
 Enables SED bypass. (pgpwde --add-bypass --disk 0 --count 6 --aa)
 Copies SED reflect drivers to needed folder for use during upgrade
 Create variable OSDSetupAdditionalUpgradeOptions to include the above reflect drivers
 Upgrade to newer version of Windows 10
 Restart computer
 Re-register the SED password filter
 Disable SED bypass (pgpwde --remove-bypass --aa)
 Reboot
 Decrypt SED encrypted drive (pgpwde --decrypt --disk 0 --aa --all)
 Uninstall SED
 The sequence goes on, but the above is the pertinent bits.
  
The issue I'm having is that the "pgpwde --remove-bypass -aa" command is failing after the upgrade.
 The error I'm getting is -11977 Improper Initialization, which I can only find one reference when Googling, which is: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=f100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427&CommunityKey=8deae12f-88a6-4d88-9186-231c4ca171d7&tab=digestviewer#bmf100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427
 Which references Linux.
 The removal of the bypass only fails before a user logs in. Once a user has logged onto the machine, and back off again, then the bypass can be removed.
 So, my thought process is that, perhaps, SED isn't sully started when Windows starts, resulting in a weird state where the commands won't run until SED finishes starting, but I'm not sure SED's underlying mechanics enough to remediate this.
 It's also an older version of SED, like 10.4 or something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow sysadmins, 
 a client of mine wants to find a way to manage their parking spots on two office locations. It's like 10 parking spots at each office.
 They'd like to have an overview what is available, pre-book for visiting clients and obviously for people who are in the office.
 It'd be great if some of you could share your experience in tackling this problem.
 My original approach would be to go with a shared outlook calendar for each parking spot, but maybe there are kickass SaaS tools or even open-source solutions for this problem?
 Thank you very much.

I've covered the high-level stuff e.g. must be cloud-based, lightweight footprint on machines, ability to disable removable drives, must work on multiple OSs, etc. What other criteria would you consider? Obviously it must detect malware; just wondering if there is anything obvious I've missed.

 I got a dc running on 2012 and new one on 2022. When deploying printers I cannot find 'Deployed Printers' in the group policy management on the dc running 2022. But I can find it under the dc running 2012 r2 group policy management. The dc's are in sync.
 Anyone got input how I can solve this?
 Update: Just found out Microsoft removed this option in server 2022 because of the PrintNightmare vulnerability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I blocked most if not all file sharing websites such as Onedrive, Google Drive and and so on to avoid receiving ransomwares (we used to receive random "hey, here's the file you requested" spoofing mails with a malicious link on onedrive mainly) so people have to ask me before they can access any link, unless it's a trusted source such as the client's own sharepoint. 
 The obvious problem is that I have to weekly authorize some websites because our clients use them some times. Everytime, I connect to our fortigate and change the web filtering exceptions.
 My question is : what is your approach regarding this, and is there a more streamlined way to do this ? Do you think it makes sense to block all sharing websites (we have our own hosted solution for sharing things, but some clients use their own and sometimes we simply cannot ask to reupload something they just sent us) ?
 I'm running on Fortigate and I don't know any internal tool that can do that, but maybe I'm wrong ? 
 I wish there was some sort of Outlook addin with fortinet where I can select a link and authorize it for a short period without having to connect to the FW directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being on site, an half hour ago, I've remotely updated the Windows OS of my jumpbox that is upstair in my server room. 
 Restarted the machine and it disappear from the network.
 No ping answer, no nslook resolution, no remote wake up answer. Times goes on... Nothing...
 My mind instantly start to think to corrupted Active Directory, corrupted DNS, DHCP problems, duplicated hostname or SID or ip with consequent network disruption ...
 ... things that are not really happening in my network since 20 years...
 I run to the server room and saw the PC looks turned on. So I turned on the monitor just to see a veeam recovery menu showing on the monitor. Then I noticed an usb key plugged in.
 I've plugged that key a couple of days before for burning a Linux ISO on it and I have completely forgotten it because I was called for another task.
 So, removing the usb and restarting the system solved all the problems.
 ​
 The fact is that everytime something happens I start thinking to the worst nightmare. And I think that's not really healthy for me. Or for troubleshooting things.
 ​
 I think also that this mindset is a consequence of this work. If you experienced something like that in the past you know what I'm talking about. You cannot forget.
 ​
 But I think this is totally unealthy and an insane mindset.
 ​
 Perhaps it is part of a impostor syndrome cause you know, this world is so big, for a One Man Show that must know everything (in no time).
 ​
 In any case, just to say, is it just me or also you have this insane way of thinking?

 when client supports DoT, it acts like 1) check if DoT/DoH supported use them otherwise use standart UDP DNS? or how clients knows which protocol to use for communication

(just one iSCSI-Initiator possible)
 ​
 Is there like a workaround? I was thinking about building 2 iSCSI LUN's and synchronise those somehow, is this possible?

 Looking back on your past experiences, is there anything you would do differently if given the chance?
 In addition, I'm curious to know the architecture you have implemented (FGCP/FGSP) on both Branch and Hub sites, as well as whether you have implemented Internet Breakout and how security was handled ?
 I look forward to your insights, which I'm sure will be invaluable not just to me, but also to others in the networking community. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone had any luck trying to use Clearpass for returning DPSKs to a Ruckus controller?
 It's one of those things that would be relatively easy on a more open platform, but looks impossible on a locked-down appliance like Clearpass.
 Clearpass certainly supports the MAC auth that the Ruckus uses in External DPSK mode. And it has no problem in returning Ruckus VSA 142 that should contain a modified version of each PSK. The problem is in storing the PSKs.
 As per the Ruckus docoumentation for the DPSK format, Clearpass would have to be able to use one of the SHA1 key derivation functions and then store a byte array based on a combination of the SSID and the PSK. Let's assume the PSK is admin-assigned, not generated for each client by Clearpass. The natural place to store a DPSK would be a custom dictionary attribute in the Endpoints repository, however, these do not support byte arrays, nor do they provide any access to basic functions. In this case the required function is definitely available to the underlying system as Clearpass uses it for hashing admin user passwords. In any case since the DPSK format is zero-padded a string field cannot be used instead.
 Anyway, I figured it worth asking if anyone had found a solution.

 I've been working for a company for a few years now and as of the beginning of the year, half my team was cut due to economic hardening, or whatever it may be. 
 Long story short, I'm now the primary contact for the security team, and also a sys admin, when I was just technical support before. The burnout is coming, I can feel it but I want to try and get ahead of it.
 What are some tips and tricks you've found that help with managing your workload/time in the midst of seemingly endless requests?

For example, for structured cabling that might "want" wall-mount patch panels on either end of pieces of conduit, combined with in-rack patch panels. I would assume each such connection will degrade signaling integrity and also PoE efficiency.
 Any pointers for me? Are there standards-based limits?

 For example today I was running DISM.exe on a troublesome computer it was stuck at 13.5% for 2-3 minutes. Just for the heck of it I hit enter key within the terminal and immediately it goes to 14% and continues on normally. 
 Maybe it is just a coincidence but I swear this has happen to me multiple times. 
 I do know the ping -t command can get stuck so hitting enter "wakes" it backup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 Was hoping someone may know this. I am busy writing some scripts in Python, one in particular is to SNMP into a switch and basically gather ARP tables as I need to Mac Address and IP Address to run NMAP scans. 
 I did a SNMP walk of a switch just to see the information it has. I came across fields that I want to extract which is easy. So my question is:
 1) I cannot seem to find how to corrolate the port number to the mac address/IP address of the device. I was hoping someone may know? I tried doing Ctrl + F on ifIndex, IP, Mac Address and VLAN but couldn't find the corrolation.
 2) Which OID should I use if I run this across chassis based switches aswell? Which will be most reliable to use? - ipNetToMediaIfIndex, ipNetToMediaPhysAddress, ipNetToMediaNetAddress or ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress?
 SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: DUMMY-SWITCH-NAME
 IF-MIB::ifName.1001 = STRING: 1/1/1
 IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaIfIndex.13600006.10.147.95.232 = INTEGER: 13600006
 IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaPhysAddress.13600006.10.147.95.232 = STRING: a2:ca:28:2b:d
 IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaNetAddress.13600006.10.147.95.232 = IpAddress: 10.147.95.232
 IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress.13600006.ipv4."10.147.95.232" = STRING: a2:ca:28:2b:d
 IF-MIB::ifIndex.1001 = INTEGER: 1001
 IF-MIB::ifDescr.13600006 = STRING: VLAN-RANDOM
 IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.1001 = INTEGER: up(1)
 IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.1001 = INTEGER: up(1)
 IF-MIB::ifDescr.1001 = STRING: Alcatel-Lucent OS6860 GNI 1/1/1 
 You may look above and say "Well who uses Alcatel Lucent", I say "Dont worry, I ask myself the same question every day".
 Also mac address above is random, so dont worry! I aim to run this across core switches or who knows, I could even run this across the odd 400 switches we have depending. 
 Hope it makes sense. Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently setup a new network and firewall configuration and one of the major changes we made was to restrict outgoing traffic to specific ports. Tonight I noticed a number of firewall entries that I have not noticed before and I was wondering if the basic logging would give any indication as to what might be happening here. The firewall itself is a cisco asa 5506, I will be looking at ways to capture the traffic in these conditions, but thought I would ask here as well. 
 The server in question does have an incoming ACL on port 443, it also has an outgoing ACL on port 443. 
 The log entry is this; 
 Feb 21 22:59:06 GMT/BST: %ASA-session-3-106100: access-list RS-DMZ_access_in denied tcp RS-DMZ/192.168.51.11(443) -> outside/x.x.x.x(57492) hit-cnt 1 first hit [0xdc286a6b, 0x00000000]
 ​
 The interesting thing to me is that is originating from port 443 and going to a random port externally. 
 Could this be some kind of http keepalive or poll? 
 We have had no reports from the operations team as to things not working, so I can only guess the impact of the block is nothing worth worrying about.

 Documentation shows that the following lines need to be entered on the box :
 **entered after device has been removed from FMC**
 # configure manager delete
 # configure manager local
 This process seems very straightforward; however, this firewall is remote to me, so I wanted to see if anyone has had the same experience running the same migration before I migrate this device myself.Thanks again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in education (high school), and I am planning to pitch a somewhat more stern approach to certain IT practices to senior management soon; in particular, I would like everyone to start using a password manager that is freely provided on every school device, to eliminate things like constant password forgetting for our various services, passwords written on post-its stuck on monitors, etc.
 I am wondering what kinds of sanctions, if any, your companies apply to 'offenders', especially serial ones, who do not follow company policy even after training has been given.
 For example, if employees have agreed as part of an AUP to use the password manager to store their passwords, but you still catch post-its lying around or they still come to you with "I forgot my password", and when you challenge it you get "oh no I am not using that password manager thing"... are there any kinds of sanctions? Disciplinary mentions on their file? Formal warnings? A stern talking to by someone senior?
 I'd just like to see what's out there, to pitch the right ideas to my senior team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiring managers are biased to choose people closer to their own age, whether it be older OR younger. Are these unique experiences I've had, or is it true for everyone?
 I am definitely on the younger side of this sysadmin thing, in my mid 20s. I do not have as much experience as some of you folks but am definitely qualified for the roles I've been interviewed for and while I'm not the best interviewee in the world, I feel I'm decent enough.
 I'm just starting my third tech/sysadmin role. I've probably had 6 or 7 interviews that have gotten to or near the final stage in this field between all of these roles. For every role I have ended up getting, my direct manager has been quite young for someone in their position, somewhere in their 20s for all of them. These aren't even interviews that I feel I've done particularly well in. In fact, I feel some of them were quite bad, worse than ones I have failed.
 However, I notice the opposite with deciders who are a generation or two older than me. Many of them more than double my age. In these interviews, I have come out feeling like I nailed every question and left no room for questioning, but still find out they have chosen the other candidate or did not choose me for hire. From my personal experiences it just seems so blatant and honestly the largest factor in the interview process. Has anyone else experienced this as an interviewee or interviewer, or have I just had some unlucky experiences?

 But the situation I'm up against is we have a trans woman who doesn't want to see her dead name anymore. I'm trying to accomplish this for her, but I'm up against a few factors that are making it a little irritating to deal with.
 So for example, cached exchange mode. Even after telling it to download the offline address book again, the name doesn't properly update. And Exchange and Teams admin centers, new name shows up when referencing the online GAL, but client-side the old name and new name often show up at the same time depending on which viewport you're opening.
 Am I gonna have to nuke offline OABs and force cache resets?
 And this does seem like a lot of unnecessary effort, but it is a very important and personal issue to her and I'd like to accommodate her wishes.

This has some potential to cause problems in our environment where people use tabs to go back and forth between sites for data lookup/entry and have text entered but not saved.
 There are ways to manually disable it from the UI, but I have yet to find a GPO rule that will turn it off. I downloaded the newest ADMX templates and skimmed them, but didn't see it listed. 
 Does anyone know a good way to disable this across the board without relying on user interaction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to find the answer to Nexus VPC peer-gateway without HSRP behavior for some time on the internet now to no avail. 
 VPC peer-gateway installs the other switch's mac in the mac table as GATEWAY so there wont be any unnecessary forwarding on the Peer-Link but in all documents it is paired with FHRP. What happens if I set the same IP address (Gateway for downstream server/router) under the SVI on both switches and enable Peer-Gateway without configuring FHRP? Just a duplicate IP address and Peer-Gateway.
 ​
 This is a long story, I'm not a fan of this since you can run HSRP on a private IP range and set a single IP from a public range as gateway for clients under the HSRP virtual IP but for some unknown reason my boss is pushing for the first option and I'm not sure what's going to break under such circumstances.
 ​
 Any input is appreciated I'm hoping to convince the boss to go for the sane method but need some better understanding first and demonstrate what negative effects it can have. Maybe it's going to work flawlessly and I just don't know about it but he is not giving me any reference to back up this solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I'm in the process of setting up the Firewall as the place where routing happens so I can do inter-VLAN inspection. See previous post. I have a Palo alto 450 connected to a Cisco 9200.
 Historically our core has been connected to a firewall via a Layer 3 connection with an IP address. 172.16.0.1(firewall) > 172.16.0.2 (Core). There are static routes on both devices that list those IPs as the next hops. 
 I'm trying to get the VLAN information and routing up to the firewall, and in order to do that I need to make a trunk connection rather than an access connection. But trunk connections don't have layer 3 IP addresses, so if I convert my access connection to trunk, I'll lose my IP addresses. But then my static route won't know where to go. 
 I'm sorry, I feel like I'm missing something very obvious here. How do I do inter-vlan routing on a firewall and still have the core switch know how to get traffic from the access switches up to the firewall?

 Hello everyone, a few months back i was promoted to IT Manager (i started as HelpDesk L1 and then as an IT Analyst; also i work in a hotel).
 The thing is that i really feel like i don't belong yet to this position, since i don't know much about Networking (I know how to configure Switches, Firewalls, Routers, AP but just the basics), Azure or AD (i don't know if it's relevant but i love to use Microsoft Power Automate).
 So any advice or tip you can give me it would be great!
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: Thank you again all of you for your responses, i'm thinking that is not what i really want, i think i would like to be like a Sys Admin or Sys Manager)

 We have switches that have uncovered empty SFP slots (I know, bad, bad, inherited environment) that have been running for several years. I now need to install an SFP module into one of said switches but I am unsure of the safest way to ensure the port is clean. The problem is the switch cannot be turned off, way too important unfortunately. My worry is possible shorts while disturbing any dust during cleaning.
 Initial thought is to use canned air in the slot. Are there any dangers that could arise from using canned air in the slot? Please let me know what you recommend.

 P.S. We are looking into dust caps for the ports.

 We are having to look at upgrading possibly part of this setup or all of it as part of a refresh due to this and preventative in case of failure of the hardware since its over 6 years old. (before my time). We have no choice but to upgrade the Watchguard m200 since the licensing which we just renewed Jan 2023 (paid for one year) but only can get it till end of June this year.
 We have been quoted by the company which we outsource some of this the Meraki kit from cisco. 
 The MX105 to replace the router/firewall which is currently a Watchguard M200.
 MS120-48FP in place of the two HPE switches and 
 MR44 to replace the ubiquity wifi access points.
 ​
 However from the research I have done, it feels quite overkill. We have about 40-50 employees in the office and 100 others working on phones remotely (which don't need to really connect to the office network). Only users which need to VPN access to the office network is about 10-20 users.
 ​
 I'm Torn between the two options (open to other options), 
  
Replace only the Watchguard M200 with the latest equivalent and upgrade the controller for the AP's to a more reliable one. 
 Follow the recommendation but possibly with a MX75 instead of a MX105.
  
One thing that does confuse me is whether some of the security features are tied to licences (advanced security, enterprise or SD-WAN) or to the devices. Features such as content filtering and web search filtering and intrusion protection. 
 What they quoted us came to about £27,000 for kit and licences for 3 years. I'm quite new to this could use some advice

 They also have a few POE devices (Unifi AP and cameras) and could benefit from a POE switch.
 Thanks in advance.

 Edit: You’re guys are awesome. Thank you so much for all the awesome suggestions. He likes the 48 Unifi POE with the 24 port as a backup. Will be configuring a VLAN for Guest Wi-Fi and one for the security cameras.

 When this issue happen I look for site ip given in IIS manager under site bindings of that url that is not working and I run below commands
 Netsh http delete iplisten ip address

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a lot of ink has been spilled on how 1Password's secret key and user password combination makes it less vulnerable than, say, LastPass and Bitwarden to having your a copy of your vault stolen and decrypted by an attacker. My understanding, then, is that basically the only way to open a 1Password encrypted vault is to be on a device that has already been authorized and have your user password. 
 So what's to stop an attacker from using a keylogger to get your user password, and then gaining remote control of your device and just logging into it? Is this just a "secure your workstation better, dummy" kinds of situations?

 I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?
 I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was "what are we fixing today". And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. 
 Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking "what is going to break today", and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.
 I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office. I dont think that they will let me go because they do love what i have done, but the anxiety side of me worries that if they dont see me actively doing something, they will think im not doing anything, and given nothing is breaking to fix, im no longer needed.

 I am developing a product for multiple clients, and that product is going to be running on the cloud as a SaaS. The product focuses on analysing the client's private security cameras, so the idea is that the client simply puts the IP of the camera and my product starts picking up the feed. In these situations most of clients have their cameras in a private network and so just by having the IP won't do any good. What would the simplest way for the client to allow my product to have access to that private network so it can access the camera feed ? 
 Thanks in advance ?

 I've got a problem with my dc here. I'm in the process of migrating a ton of VMs to another esxi host that is configured identically to the one it was on before.
 One of these VMs is a domain controller for my little experiments here. All machines get their IP config from a dhcp like this: host { hardware ethernet aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa; fixed-address dc.test }
 this works fine but now after migration I can't reach anything with the DC and vice versa. I see the DC asking for ip-configs on the dhcp-server and it does configure itself with the info obtained, but it stays unreachable. 
 tried this windows tool to troubleshoot it lol, it say the problem is that the gateway is unreachable (no shit sherlock) so as I think everything is configured correctly and should just work like with all the linux VMs i moved, i thought I'd ask here.
 Any ideas whats wrong?

I have a use case where a mobile router needs to be placed in a basement, approx. 10-15m away from a place with sufficient mobile signal. Is there an antenna with such cable length that would work? 
 Router/antenna recommendations appreciated.
 I was also thinking about getting a rigid poe-powered 4G router (btw, 5G is not a must) and placing it where the signal is available. The place is a ventilation pipe, so withstanding weather of any season is necessary. Then, I'd only have a PoE switch and an AP in the aforementioned basement.
 I'm in Europe, btw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously, our staff users have had a home drive "U:" on one of our file servers. We're currently in the process of migrating these over to OneDrive for Business, but for some staff we're finding that after we've migrated them, they are sometimes not seeing all their other network drives in File Explorer on Windows 10.
 We currently map network drives using logon scripts - Group Policy Preferences would not be practical as different users need different combinations of network drives - these scripts are batch files with commands like net use v: \\SERVERNAME\SHARENAME$ /PERSISTENT:NO.
 For the vast majority of users these are working fine but for some reason, intermittently the network drives don't show up in File Explorer. We tried re-running the logon script but that said the drives were already mapped. We went to try mapping the drives using the Map Network Drive wizard in File Explorer, and we found that the wizard could actually see the network drives. This led us to discover that restarting File Explorer made the drives visible.
 We tried setting the EnableLinkedConnections registry entry (e.g. as per this ServerFault post) but this did not help.
 We tried enabling NETLOGON debug logging on computers where the incidents were reported, but the NETLOGON debug log didn't show any obvious causes.
 Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue and how we can resolve it? Other than having our users restart File Explorer every time their drives go missing?

 Solo IT officer for a medium sized org here. I need some advice on how to handle guest users in our organisation's AzureAD/InTune environment.
 I'm quite concerned about the security implications of how it is setup currently.
 Without getting into too much detail our organisation has clients that walk in off the street and use our computer lab to work on relatively confidential documents.
 Before my time our we had setup several generic user accounts for non employees to use e.g. guestuser1, guestuser2, etc.. for the guest users which is obviously is going to leave behind traces of the files and logins stored within the user profile from the previous session which is not ideal. So I need to come up with a better solution.
 Relying on staff to send new user requests for each new guest and having me to create them and assign them office licenses is just going to be way too cumbersome.
 I need something that will allow guests to login to specific PCs with just access to the web and ms office with minimal intervention from IT.
 Wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat and what they have tried.

 I have an M365 user which account keeps getting locked, 2-3 times a day, and can't find any informations about it in M365 admin audit log.
 First thought it'll be his mobile phone so asked him to remove the M365 account on it, but account still gets locked.
 Any idea where I could find a decent log? With maybe more informations on what device (if that is the case) causes the lockout?
 Thanks !

 I have a windows process which occupy 4GB of RAM, and I need it from 9 to 10 o'clock, everyday.
 Then after 10:00, I need to manually kill it from Task Manager, to retrieve the 4GB of RAM, which I would use for other software. 
 Is there a way to kill this process at given time, automatically?

 My company has finally made the decision to migrate to Office 365/Exchange Online after YEARS of pushing them to undertake the project. We are currently just finishing up some of the prep work on our Exchange such as moving everything over to AD sync, migrating resource rooms etc before we start doing User Mailboxes.
 One of the questions is what's the best licensing model? We are looking at getting rid of our Anti-Virus and going with Microsoft Defender which comes standard with M365 E3 and M365 E5. My manager has decided to pitch the idea of going with a mixture of Business Standard and Premium with adding on Exchange Online Plan 2 (For some employees), InTune and Microsoft Defender license ON TOP of the business standard and premium.
 Are there any benefits that the M365 E3/E5 provide over the Business Standard and Premium if we add those extra licenses on top or would it just be smarter to go with the M365 E3 and E5?
 The manager has pitched massive cost savings but doesn't really make sense to go with Business Standard/Premium with the add on licenses opposed to just forking out the extra money for M365 E3 and E5?

 I've got an Supermicro Server at hands, it was set up around 2016, and it has 4 Hitachi Ultrastar SAS drives installed, since they've not been replaced yet I think they're also from 2016, so about 8 years now.
 We want to use that server as backup storage now, but I'm not sure about the old disks. 
 My gut feeling is to replace them, even if it will cost some money, but I bet they're going to fail soon and I don't want to buy old rusty rotating disks again and replace them one by one.
 Maybe someone has some experience here and / or advice? 
 Thanks in Advance!

 I'm a sysadmin at a public school with around 800 students (from 6 to 15 year olds) and 100 teachers.
 Not a single day goes by without at least 2-3 (but often more) students and/or teachers popping by my office because they forgot their password and need help to figure it out / reset it.
 I'm just wondering if this is normal in the day and age of 2023? Personally, I never forget my passwords and I'm quite baffled that, at least the teachers (20+ years old) forget their passwords this often.
 The younger kids may be excused in this case, but grown up people not being able to handle their passwords just strikes me as odd.

 Long story short - My UnRaid VM directory yeeted itself out of existence, took my backups on a hot date and just said F it.
 I went to make some changes on a VM (directly upgrading to Windows 2019 std) and had to reboot in order to accept the changes. The VM went missing - hmm that's odd - No problem! I'll just recover it from an older backup. I have a schedule of 30 days to hold backups, and they're usually overwritten when they reach 15 backups, older ones are deleted afterward.
 Those were deleted too.
 No logs.
 No errors.
 No error logs.
 No system logs.
 No alerts telling me about the missing logs.
 Nothing.
 Just an empty folder from my ~/domains/ - and no VM's in sight. I rebuilt the VM from scratch, and I'm on my merry way now. Not sure what happened - the Vendor is hopefully researching into it as it's some abnormal behavior

 I've only had 1 IT head who was technical and had great soft skills, he we an amazing boss, we could discuss technical details at length, and he knew how to carry himself and represent us in C level meetings, he was amazing. 
 Why is it that only IT has this issue? Our CFO knows all about the ins and outs of budgets/cashflow and is very knowledge in his field. Our Head of HR knows all about policies etc. Our C level exec of law is VERY knowledge in law.
 Its not just past jobs either, you wouldnt hire a head of medical surgery that had no idea how to perform any surgery. You wouldnt hire head chef who couldnt cook. Imagine hiring a head of Marketing or Sales who had little to no idea about marketing or sales.
 I'm not saying you need to be hyper technical about IT to be a CIO, but you at least have to be good at it in some capacity in ADDITION to have good soft, management and leadership skills (just like any other C level position). I'm not advocating hiring a technical person who has crap soft skills btw. 
 Is it just that finding someone who is technical and has the above skills is to hard to find in IT? So they just hire non technical people to run IT departments because thats all their is in the talent pool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been checking out the DPVS project as of recently and some of the layer 4 features seem like they could do quite well for implementing a stateful firewall I could control from a database I can interface with. I have a few machines that each have IPs on my subnet for each application I'm running and a distribution layer switch. 
 I want to use Bird for announcing my ASN and advertising my unicast subnet (potentially AnyTun package might be used for applications to have lower latency to Europe in the future) and if possible manage to implement /arouteserver for peering with cloud providers which I access frequently to lower IP transit costs. 
 Since I have no upstream to filter traffic I would be verifying on my own and forwarding to my switch the traffic and letting it manage IPs to destinations to leverage its switching capacity for when my machines will intermingle with each others' applications instead of using up the capacity on my Linux entry and BGP machine. 
 I apologize for my limited networking knowledge when it comes to design and architecture, but I have the feeling that a software based router would be the best in this scenario, if you guys have any advice for DPDK based open source projects I could leverage or implementing a firewall that could handle reasonable PPS with efficiency on a 2x40Gb/s NIC and 7950x consumer high IPC processor I would be grateful and massively appreciative.

 Its been just over a month and I think I need to pull the plug. The last month has had me at the brink of burn out with basically doing both of our jobs and trying to train them as well. I can see things are not sinking in and can out right see them not paying attention during training sessions.
 I feel it would be easier going back to solo and looking for a replacement, but does this all seem too soon, or I'm asking/expecting too much? 
 Expectations were I could assign them switch configuration tasks and they could handle them no problem, as long as proper documentation was provided. It was provided and they seem utterly lost, and I've ended up essentially doing the work.

 Our main office currently has a pair of 6807XL's in VSS, someday we'll need to replace them. Seems Cisco bumped the EOL by a few years due to supply chain issues, but the topic of lifecycle came up recently. The long story short is: We're not sure we need a chassis platform for this office, but Cisco obviously wants to upsell us and immediately flipped shit when we brought up the idea of running our "data center" off a stack of 9300X's. 
 I use the term "data center" sparingly since there is no Nexus, fabric, routing protocols, VXLAN, etc. happening. We've got less than a hundred 1G copper and about a dozen 10G fiber ports lit at the moment, a chunk of the copper is MGMT interfaces. …]]></summary>

 the siemens PLC is a passive client with a fixed ip, because we use a virtual WLC i can't activate the passive client option, so there is no arp resquest reaching the PLC, so from time to time the arp cache in the switches gets cleaned and lost connectivity. As a workaround, I created a simple pyhton script that goes into WGB and pings the PLC to generate some traffic, but I need a more professional solution. Do you guys have any suggestion to this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These things are driving me nuts. I inherited a shit show. No professional site survey before AP deployment. Have multiple zones, that my predecessor installed where apparently one new AP can do the coverage of two old APs. Laptops and mobile work stations do fine with roaming and connectivity. Using Ascom i63 phones with Ruckus R730s, SmartZone as the controller. Phones are on 5Ghz band. Phones register with the pbx. User complaints are poor roaming and "ghost calls" where the phones will ring to a bridged extension but I assume packets arrive late due to high latency (they rarely go over 50ms on the AP) and the phone rings but caller not on the other end.
 Followed the interrop report from Ruckus/Ascom to set up the WLAN. The client settings and WLAN are exactly like the interop report. Doing wireshark traces does not reveal the problem. Did several Ascom log traces and when I caught the problem, notify Ascom and apparenly we do not have some super duper special docking station which allows me to view the log file. Absolutely livid about that. Getting no real help from Ascom other than they want more Omnipeek traces. 
 I have been concentrating on one zone at a time. I got them to work better in two zones just by moving the APs further away from each other or deleting one or two. I do my own Netspot surveys and do not find coverage to be the issue. I am thinking more that co channel interference is the big issue here however neither company can point out exactly what the issue is. Does anyone have experience with this?

 Some years ago I was brought into a development company(aka all mac computers) The company was run by a guy that couldn't keep it in his pants, and often made business decisions based on "getting some". This included his now x girlfriends pole dancing studio attached to their work.
 My valuation of the companies security and systems was abismal, they didn't have a server room, cabling was all garbage, firewalls were all swiss cheesed, completely flat network. And to make matters worse the wireless was open from the studio and gave access to the entire company; my valuation was all written and a proposal was put forward to do a few things: Fix the wireing and make an act…]]></summary>

 https://web.mit.edu/6.033/2009/wwwdocs/assignments/InterdomainRouting.pdf
 It seems that its more about if an ISP is willing to route for other ISPs?
 e.g Just because two networks or ISPs can easily be connected physically, doesnt automatically mean that they are gonna connect and start routing packets for each other

 My resume isn't posted on any of the online sites in the last few years. Still I get spammed daily with at least a dozen emails from 3rd party recruiters offering me this "great" position in a place nowhere near where I live that is not relevant at all to what I do now. I tried unsubscribing but this has zero effect. Clicking the spam button when i receive them also seems to have little effect. I finally wrote a Google Apps Script to punt them right to spam and send them a canned response.
 If any of you are in the same boat, you're welcome to use my script. Feel free to modify the script to point to your own canned response or create your own list of offending domains. If you have some US based domains I'm missing, message me and I'll get them added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am seeking ways to enhance the overall security of our SSL VPN by limiting access to only corporate laptops. We have Sophos UTM9 Firewall.
 I am considering the option of utilizing SSL VPN with a Certificate. However, I am uncertain about how to configure it. Currently, we have RADIUS authentication with AD and Duo 2FA.
 Moreover, I am concerned about the possibility of the certificate being exported by end-users, which would enable them to import it into other devices and undermine our efforts to limit access to corporate laptops. 
 Would it be necessary to implement NPS to achieve this? If yes, how can I configure it?
 I am open to considering other quick solutions. 
 Any help or insights on how to accomplish this would be greatly appreciated.

 I work at a small (<15 employees) controls engineering firm. I was originally hired to design SCADA HMI screens and the database backends that collected data. As such as I was really familiar with python (jython 2.5./2.7) which is the scripting language of our SCADA software of choice and SQL. These two topics I am very comfortable with and would rate myself as above-average or better at.
 As time has gone on I have been exposed to certain network concepts just for deployment of our SCADA systems - IP addressing, firewalls, subnets, and working with Active Directories but just as a means of getting a user source for our SCADA projects, however it was all very surface level, and I only ever learned "just enough" to get things working.

Connected to each port will be a machine consisting of 3-4 lightly managed switches (addresses in the same subnet as the VLAN with the VLANs IP Address as the gateway).

 After nearly 20 years of doing this, and recently starting a new role at a new company, I made a rookie mistake by misreading/interpreting a report, and thus making a change that essentially affected nearly 3,000 users in a negative way. I'm probably beating myself up more than I think my superiors are, or will. Regardless, I feel like crap about it, feel like a failure, and need to get out of my own head to move forward.
 This is going to be a long week.
 Edit: Wow, this blew up more than I expected it to. No possible way I can respond to everyone, so I just wanted to say... Thanks! As per usual, you guys are awesome! Good news is since I no longer work in a toxic work environment, I bounced back way quicker than I ever expected to. Was back on track (physically, emotionally, and mentally) pretty much by lunchtime. Issue was resolved and just trucking forward on the next item!

 I've been working Desktop Support for about 4 years now and I'm slowly being allowed more responsibilities at my current company, such as creating new domain accounts and mailboxes and such. I just feel like I'll never be on the level of the Sys Admin I work under. When I hear the things they speak about I feel so far behind. I know keeping up to date with exams and new technologies help, but there's so much and I feel like I'll burst.

Management wants me to find a way to keep this from happening while also maintaining a secure environment. I have my concerns - if someone hacks a personal email account that puts the internal recipients at risk of receiving a malicious email, and I've expressed these concerns. They still want me to find a way. 
 If I do move forward with it - is there a overall setting that will allow personal emails to come through? Or do I need to mark each sender as safe, as they come in. Maybe the second approach is safest. What available options do I have? 
 Not looking forward to when the C-group comes to me with their hats in hand and ask me to clean up the mess they're asking me to set them up for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello altogether,
 I'd like to tell you something about task on going and I am stuck therefore I am searching for new creative ideas in this topic.
 --
 Background story: We currently use Office 2016 for Blue collar workers where they use shared-devices in order to edit documents, review or save them. Basically what a white collar does just with a M365 E3 License. However Microsoft has announced that Office 2016 and below is ending support for M365 Connectivity services - that's where the problem begins.
 Cause: Microsoft announced that Office 2016 will be dismissed with supporting connections to M365-Services like SharePoint and OneDrive. (See: Office versions and connectivity to Microsoft 365 services - Deploy Office | Microsoft Learn )
 Issue: Solution would be easy to convert everybody to M365 licenses but with almost 7500 BCs it will be way too expensive and cannot justified against management to have such an rise of expenses for licensing.
 Idea: Then I though, hey let's enable Viewer Mode for M365 products such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They can view but cannot edit them. If they need to edit documents they can use Word Online and we are going to assign them M365 F3. 
 But there is the next issue which comes with it:
 They cannot access any network shared files where all the local files are located today. Then they need to manually open OneDrive for Business and Word Online everytime and upload the files which they wanna use, save, download and upload it to the network sahre. This won't work since conflict risk is pretty high at that amount of users.
 This is not a great solution and I am out of ideas since Microsoft does not provide any further information. Before I create a ticket at Microsoft I'd like to ask the community whether you have any ideas and if you may experience the same issue in your company?
 Thanks in advance!

Our change management team have apparently renamed themselves "CMaaS" - Change Management as a Service. They have a very nice wiki and a lot of written processes, but none of these team members are scalable virtual machine clusters, as far as I'm aware. Seems sooo weird (at best) to appropriate a defined, if buzzwordy, naming convention. We have a number of weird "aaS" named services which are in now way fitting that model, but now we can apply it to actual people? Way to devalue a concept, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had no idea where to ask this so apologies in advance if I'm in the wrong place and if I get the terminology wrong (I almost definitely will)
 Long story short: I have been stalked by someone for years and no matter how many times I make sure my accounts are secured with two factor etc, they always seem to know the most specific information about me. Where I bought dresses I wear in Facebook photos, where I've booked a dinner reservation etc. In addition to this, I keep being subscribed to newsletters I don't remember signing up to. A lot of these required confirmation and the confirmation emails are nowhere to be seen in my inbox 
 Other than a public profile picture, all of my socials are incredibly secure and have been for some time due to the ongoing nature of this behaviour. 
 I thought maybe my emails were being forwarded but I've found no evidence of this (I use gmail and have multiple accounts). Tonight I was having another look around my gmail settings and I saw that my IMAP is turned on. I dont understand IMAP or POP but my understanding is, IMAP allows my gmail to be synced with a different mailbox and all changes (including deletions) are synced. 
 I'm of the belief this is how my stalker is doing it, but as this is an ongoing investigation with the police (there is a court order in place). I want to get any sort of IP information before I just switch it off. 
 Is there a way to do this? Am I understanding all of this correctly? Do any of you have any other ideas? It's been going on for so long and most police I talk to are tech illiterate haha.
 Apologies for the long post and thank you in advance

 Is there any way to do this from the admin side, without requiring every single user to view his own profile? I know MS says there isn't but maybe someone came up with a creative solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're currently looking at the process necessary for installing the Exchange Cumulative Update on our on-premise Exchange server. We noticed from Microsoft's notes that it says:
  
The following types of customized settings will be overwritten when you install an Exchange CU: 
 Any customized Exchange or Internet Information Server (IIS) settings that you made in Exchange XML application configuration files on the Exchange server. For example, web.config files or the EdgeTransport.exe.config file. 
 Customizations to the operating system's TLS/Cipher settings. 
 Be sure save this information so you can easily re-apply the settings after the install. After you install the Exchange CU, you need to re-configure these settings.
  
Does anyone have or know of a script that can check for and back up all of the possible customizations that could be overwritten by an Exchange CU? Ideally only backing them up if they are changed from the default.

 Aggregation of data. I have multiple wireless controllers so I need graphs on total number of users (per SSID).
 Other graphs and alarms on WiFi-related problems.
 This is in addition to monitoring a multivendor switched and SD-WAN network.

 One person just gets ahead and writes about the existing problem to my facebook messenger... Like what the heck? Why would you do that? If you have some mobile internet then why not write to our HelpDesk? Or at least e-mail or the messenger we use in work? Why would you write to a messenger I never use for work and is only personal? I mean I will probably just block that person over there. Or at least ignore.
 I'm sorry for this rant but I really don't get some people. Why do they want to bother us so much?
 Do you guys have similar experiences? How do you deal with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know we all hate those little yellow Post-It notes with passwords, but…
 So this week my childhood best friend’s brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. He was barely fifty. The family had no idea where to start. They didn’t know if he had a will and, if so, who might be the executor. They didn’t know his financial relationships. They didn’t know his insurance policies. They didn’t know who his lawyer was. He was somewhat secretive, and they were stumped.
 What they did have was a stack of four laptops, ranging from his current laptop to plan older one circa 2004. They brought them to me to see if I could “hack” into them and glean anything that might point them in the right direction. I promised I would do what I could.
 I started with the only one that had a power adapter. I was lucky enough that the default account, “user”, had no password and had admin rights. I logged in, reset the password for his account, and started hunting. I found a few work-related documents and some photos of his kids and not much else.
 Next, I gathered all the old laptop chargers I had around and tried to fit the laptops. No luck. Where is my universal charger? ugh. Anyway, I opened one of the laptops and what comes fluttering out? A single Post-It Note. I though, “Please let this be a password”. We all know that is the main use of these damn yellow sticky papers, right? Well it wasn’t, but it was just as good. It was a list of names and phone numbers. Lawyer. Banker. Investment advisor. Insurance agent. Mortgage broker. The works.
 Anyway, thank God for little yellow notes, but I still need to get into the laptops. Anyone have any recommendations for boot sticks that might permit resetting SAM accounts, mounting file systems, etc? I used to use Trinity Rescue Kit, but that was half a career ago. I am also hoping nothing is encrypted; wish me luck.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Quick question, hopefully someone can assist, this is the first time I have properly configured STP rather than set the defaults and run, and I am not 100% sure if I should even have it enabled over the MC-LAG links for the Juniper Top of Rack or leaf switch stack.
 The link below is an example of the network layout I am configuring.
 https://imgur.com/a/B5bAy5J
 Should I disable RSTP and VSTP on the Juniper, on the MC-LAG interface to the core switch? Currently it is set up with RSTP, the MC-LAG interfaces are set to point to point and other interfaces are edge, the ICL between the stack has RSTP disabled, and it's set block BPDU on edge.
 The Cisco portion of the network has Rapid-PVST+, the core is the root bridge, the others are default, access ports are portfast, etc. basic Cisco set up really.
 I am not sure if I should disable all STP on the MC-LAG interfaces to the core and management switch, the MC-LAG stack is an aggregate switch stack, should it just pass through the BPDU packets? I believe this is what the Juniper documentation is getting at but it's a little wishy washy on that. This would basically leave Cisco to run STP on its network, and just leave the rack alone. Or do I pass through the packets and enable Rapid-PVST+ on the management switch, on the other side of the Juniper MC-LAG?
 Or should I also be setting up the Juniper MC-LAG stack to be handling the incoming BPDU packets from the Cisco? I would have to add PVST to it as well for interoperability, I am just not sure how this may affect the RSTP running locally, which was recommended to be enabled by Junipers docs.
 Any help would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the process of installing "PERC H310" cards on two Dell PowerEdge R510 servers (to remplace the "PERC H700" and "PERC 6/i" they were originally shipped with, to gain JBOD/passthrough support).
 But I can't simply re-use the original SAS cables: connectors are different and card are in different PCI slot (so length is not the same).
 Here are some pictures:
 Pictures 1 and 2: SAS sockets on the backplane:
 https://wtf.roflcopter.fr/pics/XiwTIFvE/IxaHwTFl

 Pictures 3 and 4: SAS plugs on cable, backplane side:

 Picture 5: Sockets on PERC H310:
 https://wtf.roflcopter.fr/pics/DCpMjMYF/c31SgmeW
 So I need cables with same plugs as pictures 3 and 4 on one side, and compatible with socket of picture 5.
 Could you please help me to identify the plugs/connectors names so that I can find+order the one I need?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I’m in my early 30’s and 6 months ago became the lone IT guy in a medium sized business (~200 devices). I currently work with an MSP who has dropped the ball quite a few times and has long lead times. I personally feel they can’t adequately support the user base in a timely fashion. 
 Currently, I’m not unhappy with the job, but I find myself a bit bored after I got myself up to speed on the infrastructure and the security improvements that needed to be made. My job also shifts rapidly from providing level 1-3 tech support along with sys admin tasks. I find myself wanting co-workers to bounce ideas off of, but I don’t have that outlet here. I’m getting the itch to move onto something else, but I’m not sure where I want to land and how to get there. I like the sysadmin side of things and implementing sensible security policies. 
 Has anyone been in a similar position before? Where did you wind up?

Basically, we support close to 10k-12k users. my job is to DIRECTLY receive calls from users and catalog it in a CRM software (pivotal). Yes, i do the tech support, and I also have to document everything that happened during the call. Now I average about 50-60 calls a day, and I'm expected to average 8 minutes per call(which doesn't really happen but ok), and as you know IT problems tend to repeat themselves so i lack to see the logic of logging EVERY call and step I did. There is basically no ticketing system implemented, and it is really maddening when you come to think of it. What's your take on this? I'm 4 months in, and I'm already kinda burned out.

 About 4 years ago, after a security incident my company decided that AWS was the future and on-prem data center was the way of the dinosaur.

Migrations ground to a halt last year when a mid tier clients AWS environment blew by their annual costs to run in the DC in just 3 months at a fraction of the performance.

 I have about 80 VLANs. I need NAC for about only 10 of them because they're more sensitive than the other 70.
 My environment:
 -Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices -Meraki switches (MS390) -Wired network (we aren't looking to do NAC for WiFi) -We want only device-based authentication so everyone on an authorized device can use it on that VLAN; have no use for user-based auth -Budget for this is almost $0 -We currently have an on-prem AD environment but it's gradually going away in favor of Azure AD
 If you were to do port-based NAC for devices on a few VLANs today, which solution would you use? I am currently shying away from Microsoft NPS because we are dismantling ADCS and our overall on-prem infrastructure.

 We’re also looking at a way that we can force sensitive documents to stay within a repository to prevent peaks to the outside world. For example, a financial doc that sits on our financial share shouldn’t be able to be copied off. However, our documents are so scattershot we have no idea what users have already squirreled away on their machines.
 We’re developing policy for these things now, but I’d love suggestions on tools / techniques used to enforce it. 
 Any input is very much appreciated
 Edit:
 We use Microsoft and Apple workstations, Windows and Linux servers, Google Workspaces and Office 365, On prem AD that syncs to Azure AD (so a hybrid AD environment)
 Our file servers are on prem. We have a lot of data in Google Drive and higher up’s are wanting to open up O365 for users to put docs in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apart from ansible or similar scripting tools, is there a standard way to manage ssh keys for your server? The context is when a team member leaves, I’ve no clue of their access. There’s no documentation that keeps track of it. So I need to ssh to each server and remove their key if found. First problem is keep the access documented which is already in process but apart from that is there’s anything which will help like SSO, where the identity is linked to AD and once their account is made inactive they shouldn’t be able to authenticate.
 I thought of writing a script which talks to AD server and allow/deny login using SSHCMD or something and keep it in every server but in event of AD failure it’d be impossible to login to any server. But it seems like a hack than a standard procedure.

 I've stuck to honesty because I don't want to get a job that I can't do. The problem is that I then don't get much success from my interviews. 
 I have been involved in interviews and seen that a lot of candidates just lie and say they can do anything they get asked about and then come unstuck when it comes to the technical interview.
 ​
 So my question is - am I wrong for being honest? How much does everyone else embellish (or just plain lie)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if someone can point me in the right direction: I'm looking into assigning a block of addresses to each user when using corporate Wi-Fi that they can use for their respective devices when connecting to Wi-Fi with their laptops/phones/other misc. equipment. 
 - A user logs into wifi with their credentials (802.1x)
 - Each user is assigned a fixed subnet (a /28 in the 10 space, and a /64 in the v6 space) for their devices
 - The users would retain this block of addresses for the duration of their engagement with the organization. (Some of these users would have additional rules as well to coincide with regulatory requirements, or other reasons, these would most likely take place at the router and firewall levels) 
 I was investigating the possibility of using radius to assign a different vlan to each individual with the contained subnets, however this gets unruly assigning a different private vlan to several hundred different users. I'm wondering if there is a better solution out there someone could point me in the right direction. I'm working with Aruba hardware. 
 If someone can point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it. I'm recently reentering the network design world and discovering I'm forgetting more than I remember about this topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 Looking to learn a "cookie cutter" sort of speak network setup for small business.
 Yes... I do realize every business is different but the best way for me to learn is to have a goal and work towards meeting that requirement.
 Theoretical scope would be a small business such as a coffee shop, auto mechanic, dental office, insurance office, etc. Consisting of 10 ppl or less with computers, printers, mobile devices, 2-3 IP cameras, a file server or two, with occasional guests.
 Internet line would probably range from 200mb-1gb down and 50mb-200mb up
 My thoughts on equipment that would cover this range would be:
 ISP Modem > Router > Firewall > Switches > APs
 ISP Modem > Netgate 2100 > Unifi Switch Lite 8 POE > Unifi U6 Lite(s)
 Ive used Ubiquiti gear before so I think the POE switch and AP's would be a good fit. 
 Netgate 2100 is the router firewall VPN appliance I think I'm settling in to learn.
 Would this setup be a realistic real world configuration for a small business? 
 Ideally, I'd like to learn this and implement this into friends and family's businesses as a side hustle then expand to regular customers to grow even more.
 Thanks for your help and time!

I have a really good understanding of network fundamentals but have been out of practice now for 2 years since I got a new job more on the incident management side of things for a video game company. 
 I am looking for some resources to help me acquire the JNCIA-Junos certificate so I can make the jump to our networking department who uses mostly Juniper devices. When I was studying for my CCNA I got lucky and found a community college near me that offered a 1 year crash course to prep you for the CCNA. This included hands on labs and a ton of reading. I managed to get my CCNA after 2 tries and really enjoyed the networking job I had except for the fact that they where paying me 40k a year in Los Angeles which basically meant I was poor. 
 What I am looking for is some resources to study for the JNCIA this can include:
 Websites
 Youtube training videos
 Online paid courses
 Text books
 Anything really to help get comfortable with the Juniper command line 
 I am willing to pay for courses so anyting helps please. If anyone here has passed there JNCIA lets have a conversation. There are some oppertunities at my job for Networking but they are all for Juniper devices which I am not familiar with.

 Any benefit to breaking up a single RAID into multiple partitions for a server other than organization?
 I understand it helps prevent the OS drive from filling, but other than that any other benefits?
 Say you have a Hyper-V server and you do one of the following:
 Raid5 - > 5TB
 C: drive = 200GB D: drive(Virtual disks) = 4TB E: Drive(snapshots) = 800GB 
 Versus:

Back in the day I had a nice Nagios setup with groundwork open source. I exposed the cgi-bin via a reverse proxy that required client certificates. Installed aNag app on my Android device and had a widget on my phone home screen. Net result was that if I (as an example) dropped a disk from my md-raid, my phone would get an active alert within 5 minutes.
 Now in 2023 I am looking to start fresh and ask for suggestions on a completely new monitoring system that meets that requirement. What will alert me within 5-10 minutes of a failed disk, to my Android phone? Active monitoring only, not something that pushes an email or something, since if that system failed, it could fail quiet. 
 All clients to be monitored are Linux and I'm only interested in free and open source tools. Right now I'm leaning towards checkmk/omd.

 I googled the error and it came down to a SPN issue. Basically the the gMSA account was unable to register SPN. I tried to register manually but AD said there was duplicate entry already.
 To finish the move to the new cluster I ended up creating an old school service account and set SQL to use it then remote connections to SSMS began working. 
 Any ideas why this gMSA didn't work. The 2 servers are in an AD group that I used when I generated the gMSA account. Any ideas, did I miss something?

 Two possible strategies for booting hosts from their assigned LUN:
  
Identical host HBA configs --they all get the same target WWPNs and target LUN ID. The pairing of each host to its designated LUN is done on the array side (i.e. each LUN is presented to only one host via export with the common LUN ID. For this project I'm using LUN zero everywhere).
 Present the basket of boot LUNs to the entire cluster of hosts; each LUN is "exported" with a unique LUN ID. Pair each host with its designated LUN by setting the appropriate target LUN ID on the host HBAs.
  
The first method strikes me as cleaner and safer. It's one less touch-point to worry about as hosts will have i…]]></summary>

 I handle networking for pro-av AVoIP applications including SDVoE and smpte 2110. These devices essentially all rely on multicasting, IGMP, and are in the realm of 10Gb to 25Gb per device/host. One issue that i've seen frequently in some courses panels in regards to switch stacking, is that by stacking switches you can quickly run into severe multicast flooding. Arista deals with this through what they call "Multi-cast Orchestration" on their own switches, and Netgear acknowledges it's an issue and says "Care should be taken" when stacking switches- however I haven't heard anyone mention how to actually prevent or stop that multicast flooding on a network without something like Arista's proprietary product. Is there a common approach to handling this I'm not aware of or some 3rd party product which can handle this? What is the "care" you would even take to prevent that form of multicast flooding? 
 The reason for the stacked switches is to achieve 100% redundancy, allow easier expandability, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Group policy from Microsoft Windows 2019 CIS Benchmark v1.2.1 was accidently applied to all Server 2012 R2 and Server 2016 servers, and is causing the following:
  
Black screen trying to RDP in to server
 
Services are down, and not able to open applications on servers
 
Server Manager error message at login. "This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action..."
 
Taskmgr.exe error message "No such interface supported."
 
 Which means most of business is down.
 The root cause seems to be related to file permissions changes in the GPO
 https://i.imgur.com/XQlHIEw.png
 https://i.imgur.com/Jx9ZJLI.png
 Manually restoring the permissions has been tried, but it was unsuccessful. Reverting the GPOs does not solve the issue as it does not revert the changes.
 It was supposed to go to test first. Unluckily it was applied to server OU. We'll of course take care of the administrator who did it, this is quite an unfortunate event. Is full restore the only way to go, or is it possible to fix it? Any ideas fellow sysadmins?
 Edit: The servers are not receiving updates to GPOs anymore. Any changes you do/remove/add a GPO will not be updated to any servers.
 Update from the morning of 19.02.2023: Shit guys we're deep in it, the restores are failing for some reason. Complete rebuild has been initiated while we are trying to find workarounds and get Microsoft escalation.
  
Some servers you cannot reach at all, while others you can actually get access to through management tools or run wmic.
 Domain Controllers not affected, GPO was applied to servers OU

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is a dumb question. I'm not a sysadmin myself, in fact I'm pretty new to the IT world.
 I was tasked with connecting my org's SSO solution to our Google domain so we could use 2FA. I thought I had set it up wrong because when I logged out and back in, there was no redirect to the SSO page; it just took my Google password as always. I did some digging and apparently the reason is that I'm a Super Admin for our domain and Google doesn't allow Super Admin accounts to use SSO (unless you're signing in from within a network mask...which I don't understand). I then tested it with multiple end user accounts, and the SSO redirect worked correctly.
 I'm confused. Wouldn't the Super Admin accounts have the biggest need for protection? These are the accounts with the highest privileges. I must be missing something here, right?
 Edit: I understand now. In my head I was thinking SSO implied 2FA, which it doesn't. You wouldn't want an admin account to be using SSO without 2FA but Google can't really enforce that without ruling out SSO altogether. I'll change the post flair. Thanks y'all!

I have extensive experience with break/fix of UCS servers and VMware, but I've never administered it on a large scale before. I've seen enough broken VMware setups to have a general idea of what not to do, and what to do. However, I recognize I have quite a bit to learn :)
 I am looking for "pro tips" on steps I should take when I take over the environment. I figured the veteran sysadmin wizards here have taken over an environment before and have thought "I wish I did X sooner". This is the practical and actionable advice I'm looking for.

We have had Fortinet’s technical demo and have heard their claim that they are “best” due to a mix of value, ease of use and performance (Paralell Processing). Palo is scheduled this week to discuss why they are the best.
 our IT security team is pushing Checkpoint hard. Their basis is it’s the most secure and point to 2 things. Testing showing that they block way more attacks than all the others and a claim that there are no CVEs in the last 8 years. The first item I’m disregarding because it’s a checkpoint sponsored test comparing Physical Hardware to VMs. 
 However the second claim has me intrigued. I looked and there are really no publicly available CVEs listed for Checkpoint. With a system based so heavily on Linux and so many technical changes in the last 10 years, is it really feasible to have 0 CVEs? In my mind that is the IT version of “My shit don’t stink”. And if so, why is that platform so much more secure?
 Edit: Thanks to those who provided links. It sounds like I was right to call BS on the second claim. Much appreciated!

 we are currently looking into switching to MFA through Azure AD with our Endpoint VPN solution. Everything fine so far except one part of the organization who use the VPN solution, but are not synchronized to our main Azure AD. They use their own Azure tenant.
 Synching them to ours as well (and license them) is not an option.
 I read about cross tenant access. But I don't get how I should be able to select a group from the other tenant in my Conditional Access policy for the App that controls the VPN solution.
 Do I have to look into B2B direct connect and somehow synchronize these users into our tenant? I would not want that. I tried adding a group through B2B direct connect that is allowed to access my tenant, hoping I could then select that group in CA - but it seems that's not how it works.
 Any hints appreciated - thanks!

I've gone over the configs dozens of times and everything looks perfectly fine; however, the links just will not come up.
 As an afterthought, I swapped out one of the (passive)QSFP-H40G-CU3M cables with a (active)QSFP-H40G-AOC3M cable and the link comes right up. We have 8 of the passives, as that is what Cisco sent with the BOM. Is there a config I'm missing somewhere to allow the passive cables to work? Or could it be that maybe the QSFP Microcontroller on the Nexus switches can't use the passive cables?
 The switches can see the transceivers, they just don't initialize the port.

 Greetings!
 Im a small ISP with just a lil over a gig of traffic in some isolated island somewhere in Asia. I have a contract with our local government units and department of education on improving their internet connection. I have observed that most of my network's traffic consists of google. About 40% to 50% google and another 40-50% facebook. Ive recently got my network its own ASN and public ipv4 ipv6. 
 Right now I have sent a request to google about it. Im just curious to know since on their website, it doesnt show any other requirements aside from having to have asn and ipv4 in RIR directory. 
 Does google require certain TRAFFIC to be able to qualify for GGC?

 On Wednesday a vmware horizon VDI server that was stood up last week was compromised because the technicians responsible didn't install the log4j patched version of the server. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved.
 On Thursday a client's email was suspended due to breaching the terms of service of the incumbent email provider who they were still paying for service that is well below the tier of RackSpace because sales would not insist that a modern email service be used. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved. 
 I inherited the job of migrating an imap email server to m365 with an expected completion date of Friday whilst being the escalation point for 10 L1 technicians. This went as expected. 
 Last night I went home and had a panic attack. Theoretically if I cared enough about the client migration I would be working on all weekend but I don't because we were able to get the old email vendor to re-establish the account until we can migrate, I'm spending time on Indeed, Monster & Dice trying to find a life boat out of this hellhole.
 The point of this post is to never, ever, trust an MSP with your environment past the point of giving them a runbook or utilizing them for L1 helpdesk. Never give them administrator credentials. 
 If you ever think about being coerced into working for an MSP stick your hand in a rat trap, remember the pain, and realize that MSP is the hotel California of the IT profession. 
 Once you have that stink on you it's hard to get it off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone!! 
 Looking for some advice on how best I can continue my learning as well as whether I made a good choice: 
 I work as an IT Net Admin for an ISP. I have decided to take a job working for a federal contractor due to the pay increase and benefits for my family. 
 The job that I ended up taking is pretty much help desk stuff at a healthcare facility. 
 The trouble I think about is whether I made a choice that puts me back a few steps or if I've made a good choice. 
 Background:
 My current job as a net admin is pretty wtf imo. It was all good at first with my previous boss. Like I stayed within the confines of my JD but he left and now instead of being the net admin to all 3 separate departments, I'm stuck messing around trying to help 1. 
 Firstly, my boss doesn't know anything about Wi-Fi, networking and network devices. He does know voice stuff I guess? (supposedly. He basically relies on support to give him all the answers and then says it like he knew all along). 
 Secondly, I am technically supposed to resolve networking issues for the IT department as a whole, clients and most installs as well as build networks for projects but I'm too busy trying to run around and be the manager my boss isn't for 1 group that I wasn't even supposed to pay this much attention to. 
 Thirdly, I am honestly running around trying to be a dude in construction and find ways to get an install done for clients without having the company spend on contractors to do that work professionally. It's the weirdest thing ever. 
 Lastly, My JD explicitly stated I'm only supposed to be resolving network issues and build our large projects and when I bring this up I get the "I know. Thank you. You're really doing amazing." 
 There's more to the story but I'm really trying to not rattle on.

 Client has Windows 11 HP Notebooks, USB-C docks and Kyocera MFPs. KX Universal Printer Driver (v.8.3.0815).
 / Scenario A Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print, then click Print <Prints fine>
 / Scenario B Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print View Printer Properties (No changes) OK Click Print <Word hangs, doesn’t Print> [Killing Printer process makes Word resume]
 / Scenario C No Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print View Printer Properties (No changes) OK Click Print <Prints fine>
 This can only be reproduced:
  
When the Dock is attached (whether using LAN or WiFi).
 When the Printer Properties are viewed (to change colour, tray, etc).
  
If we disconnect the Dock, use LAN, all works fine.
 We have uninstalled AV, Office Add-ins, updated drivers, Windows update etc. 
 It does work with other printers and print drivers, but the client needs the Universal Printer Driver.
 I’ve ran Procmon and can see ‘Print Isolation Host’ doing it’s thing, touching Kyocera DLLs, and have captures from successful and failed prints. Nothing jumps out.
 The fact the dock is a factor makes me think there’s some kind of conflict or memory issue. 
 Any suggestions welcomed!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m learning about event driven architecture and investigating which message broker appears to be the best fit for me.
 I was looking into Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ and found that the former has a supplementary system named Apache Connect, which essentially allows to use a bunch of third-party connectors as event sources or event sinks.
 E.g. with Kafka, if I wanted to make an event “NewUserCreated” when a new row is inserted into Postgres database’s users table, I can just use a Postgres connector and configure it as event source (haven’t tried yet actually but I understand so). With Confluent, I can configure all of this with a visual GUI.
 But with RabbitMQ, would I need to be making custom connector scripts? E.g postgres database allows webhook trigger, so I make a cloud (edge) function that connects to RabbitMQ and sends the event.
 Or is there something analogous to Apache Connect but designed for AMQP message brokers like RabbitMQ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone else will have come across this. Generally speaking we purchase all devices through Apple Business account so it will already be in the Apple Business Manager but every now and then there’s a need for us (or a client) to purchase directly and the. Add to ABM manually. 
 What’s winding me up is how inconsistent this experience is.
 Normally it’s as simple as switch the device on, get to the WiFi part of setup and then if fire up Apple Configurator on another iPhone that’s signed into ABM, it detects this and the new device is added to the ABM. You then need to immediately change the MDM to InTune on ABM and force an InTune to ABM sync before you allow it factory reset. It’s then hit and miss on whether or not the device will get stuck at the “obtaining configuration from org” screen. So it’s already a bit flaky even for orgs where this is about as simple as it can be (single profile for that enrollment method) but “tends” to work. 
 That’s annoying but I can live with it. What’s annoying me more is that on some new devices fresh out of the box (and old that are factory reset) they refuse to pair up at the WiFi screen, nothing happens at all. Trying to find information on troubleshooting that aspect seems impossible. Very few people using the iOS Apple Configurator App it seems. 
 Posting here in the hopes that someone else has come across the issues above and has any advice on troubleshooting either of them?

My country is extremely notorious for having toxic corporate environments, weak labor laws, zero percent worker protection, political infiltration, and managers that are clueless & wicked, etc such that you actually find people quitting their good-paying jobs because of toxic environments -that is what I'm contemplating getting into. My current workplace doesn't stress me, the people are civil and the processes are professional and standardized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 We have Windows 10 (going to Windows 11 shortly) Hybrid Azure AD joined devices with LAPS setup. We are working towards getting our devices into Intune but aren’t there yet. 
 Remote devices have BitLocker with a Pin setup, and we had a theft of a laptop recently and luckily the device was BitLockered with decent pin, we reset user password and revoked 365 sessions for good measure – end of IT’s involvement. Everyone in our org has MFA enforced, we have configured recommended Conditional Access policies and we generally follow best practice where we can.
 But it got me thinking, if that laptop had not had a BitLocker Pin (TPM ONLY) or the Pin was weak (or user had written it down on a post-it note in the laptop bag…….) what would the thief been able to access? They wouldn’t have been able to caddy the drive due to TPM but could they have booted off a USB utility tool (Hiren or whatever it is now) and reset the Administrator password and then logged in as local admin and had access to the local user profiles and data?
 If so, is there anyway to mitigate this? I also note that deploying devices via Intune/AutoPilot, there is no out of the box/automated way of setting a unique TPM pin which wages a debate about if pin is even necessary.

 From what I've read, L3 is the way to go, bringing the L3 down all the way to TOR or even the server. Everything is routed, small L2 domains.
 As an example, the K8s networking plugin is Calico. This is a pure L3. Given a cluster-wide IP pool of 10.20.0.0/16, it carves out a smaller subnet (like a /26 by default) and assigns it to each node. Each node is on a different /26 block, and traffic is routed by the node east-west. Outbound …]]></summary>

 However, even though i feel underpaid, i think the amount of security knowledge i gain week after week is really valuable, and i always hear people talk about trying to break into security, and it seems like i have luckily been able to do so. 
 This new role sparks my interest very much bc i do enjoy voice, but I’m worried about leaving the security space and possibly making it harder to return after my VoIP arc 
 Thanks in advance for any advice!
 Tl;Dr 
 Currently feel underpaid in network security 
 I like voice and got an offer for 70% more as a voice engineer for a large company 
 Worried about it being hard to get back into security after i do VoIP for a couple years

 I've tried TP Link's EAP660, while it does have VLAN, they aren't dynamic. It's just one VLAN per SSID. The user logs in via radius, but has the regular IP address of the SSID's VLAN.
 I've looked into UDM Pro but dislike their ecosystem. I do not need cloud management and their firmware doesn't work well if it's locally managed (lots of required reboots).
 Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!

 I'm a one man IT guy for a small business and would like to replace a file server that is used by about 20 users and currently has about 500gb of files and an MS Access DB. I would just like some advice/recommendations about the below config. 
 Edit: It would need to run Windows Server for AD and GPOs. The CPU was selected for the potential of a VM or two.
 Selected Configuration From Dell 
 Model: Dell T150
 CPU: Intel® Xeon® E-2378 2.6GHz, 16M Cache, 8C/16T, Turbo (65W), 3200 MT/s
 RAM: 16GB UDIMM, 3200MT/s, ECC
 HDD: 1TB 7.2K RPM SATA Entry 3.5in x2 in RAID1 for the OS
 OS: Windows Server 2022 Standard
 I would upgrade the OEM RAM with a 2x16gb kit of Crucial Memory since Dell’s memory prices are crazy

 For main file storage I would add two WD Red 10tb drives in RAID1

Bad patch cable. When I replaced the patch cable, couldtrax said it was online and couldn't communicate. No matter how many times I disconnected the ports to shut the device off from the server closet it wouldn't work. Had to get a 20 foot ladder and unmount and reseat the cable there. Magically it started working.
 ​
 THE BIG QUESTION
 When I have something that happens with a cable with one of these access points, do I need to go directly to the access point and reseat it?
 ​
 Notes: Monitoring it before, it was in and out with connectivity, and I think this was primarily because of the patch cable.
 I didn't test the wire run from the server closet to the AP. Did a constant ping with no issues, and thus far, it's been consistent with the other 2 AP's.

 (wire goes from access point to patch panel, from patch panel to PoE port on on injector, then injector port goes to switch).

 What is the cheapest tool I can use to print out a cable certification. 
 Kind you, we have fiber running into switches with cat5 ( NOT CAT5E ) runs. I digress, I'd honestly rather do this myself than contract it out. Because it opens possibilities of me doing work and upgrading our fire stations since our it contracts all of that work out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every single time I try to upgrade the code on these (AP250s/Atoms) via the cloud based HiveManager (now Extreme Cloud IQ) I run into failures. It's hit or miss. The Atoms almost always fail and require a power cycle or a complete factory reset before the update can succeed. The AP250s exhibit the same behavior, but not as often. Sometimes I do have to deactivate PoE on their backhaul ports to get them to eventually behave.
 Every AP is backhauled btw, no mesh. 
 To troubleshoot, I've consoled into a couple while this process happens, but the logs I see give no clear indication of why updates could have failed besides some vague messages about losing connectivity to the cloud.. but they're rebooting and won't have connectivity to anything. The cloud console gives no information whatsoever after a failure. In the device list, the ones that eventually fail get stuck at 12% on the progress bar... for HOURS.
 These are all legacy Aerohive devices by the way. We had these before AH was acquired by Extreme. Are we running into some kind of planned deprecation situation? The thing that bothers me is even when we were running Aerohive's Mangler, this stuff still happened, but not as bad and way less frequent.
 Is extreme/aerohive's cloud management just this bad? Or is there something wrong with how these are deployed/operating? These things are workhorses. And after tuning the hell out of the system due to a high-density/high-interference environment, users have been happy. I'm actually very impressed with the flexibility and features these things provide. But upgrading them takes half a day or more... and it clenches my butt every time.
 Thanks for reading, and thanks for any insight anyone may provide.

 My multi state grocery store company has used Kronos for a long time now. My new store manager started using UKG to create weekly schedules. So our schedules went from two pages to around eight a week. I am supposed to be able to us UKG Dimensions and see my Kronos punches and schedule. Well I put in the url that my company says to put in the UKG site and app. I can see my Kronos punches fine. But it randomly shows the schedule. Never the current schedule or upcoming, but it will show what it was two weeks ago sometimes. 
 What I am wondering is... Is there a box/setting the manager has to have selected while making the UKG schedule to have it show up on the UKG Dimensions website/app? I can find no UKG help board that does not require a sort of membership to even ask them. So I thought I would try here.

 So it was very simple task. User was not receiving an email from certain email address(it is a distribution list address) in their outlook. So I wanted to forward the email coming to that email address to user's email address. 
 To do this we have to change the mailbox in OWA to the distribution list address and set forwarding settings to user's email. But some reason my brain lagged and I forwarded user's email to that address. The user called me next day saying that there are no emails /receiving email in their outlook client/OWA. I immediately knew what I did and disabled the forwarding setting and they were able to receive emails again. But emails during forwarding setting was enabled was not in their mailbox. I checked with our l2 team and they said it impossible to do anything in this case. I also did not check keep a copy during forwarding. 
 So not only I did not do my job, I created a task for user where they have to request the sender to send the emails again which is a very troublesome task depending on how many emails they received during that time. I requested user to check if the emails could be sent again yesterday. Or they have to contact the distribution list owner and send their emails back. Now I am waiting for user response and depending on their response I might lose my job. I had a panic attack and still thinking about it. How I could do such a simple mistake. I am doing help desk for 1year and never felt like this. I am not sure If we can share this here. I just wanted to share it to someone.

 I have a tracking system called Mosys. It is run on an intel nuc (rehoused with custom software).

Since this is mounted on a camera, there are a lot of benefits of wireless transmission.

If anything, it seems like the issue has gotten worse. The only fix that helps temporarily for most systems is to push a in place upgrade task sequence via SCCM. This seems to correct whatever component store/SXS corruption initially, but the problem is it seems like for many systems, the problem resurfaces in a month or two. We've since had two Premier tickets with Microsoft without any identification of a root cause. We have looked for various underlying trends such as build process, PC model, installed features/software, antivirus, etc but have been unable to pin it down. We're still using WSU, but we don't believe the issue is on the update server side. It just seems that at some point these machines get corrupted and no amount of SFC or DISM will fix them. In place repair will fix them but only temporarily. Anybody else deal with similar issues? It's frustrating to deal with in an environment where 100% patch compliance is expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been setting up networking (internet and cameras) for a small hotel and restaurant in the Caribbean for the past 3 years. They started off small (just 1 building) but they keep growing. They own about a whole acre of land where they keep building small "bungalows" and container rooms. Now they decided to buy the property across the street and covert it to another 5 rooms for the hotel. They want internet and IP cameras across the street. The "street" is unpaved, and the other property is 84 feet from the office where I keep the modem and router. I'm leaning toward using Cat 6 or fiber to span this distance. My business partner wants to use a Ubiquity air max bridge. I haven't set one of these up, so I don't know how reliable or complicated they are. Theres no vegetation in the line of sight, but it rains a lot. Currently I use a Huwei LTE modem/router with 3 Unifi AP's. I think I am going to add a load balancing router so I can use two ISPs for more consistency and speed. 
 The owner said we could bury a conduit if we want. Also I could hypothetically use the utility poles to span cable (is that a good idea)? I want something thats going to work 99% of the time. I don't live down there so if theres a problem, I have to call and walk someone (usually with very little IT experience) through how to reset a device or trouble shoot. I need reliability.
 I do want to future proof this. If you bury conduit, how deep do you normally go and what diameter do you use? Would you use fiber, Cat 6 cable or a wireless bridge? I really appreciate any help you can offer.

 We use acls on our core switches primarily (Cisco nexus environment) and some acls on the distribution switches and I’m sure using a microsegmentation tool would be much better in terms of ease of use, visibility and security as well.
 Upon doing some research I came across guardicore and saw a few videos on YouTube and it looks good but I have no idea since I haven’t used it.
 Is it a good tool and what tools does everyone else use and can you recommend some good ones?
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s your top advice to someone starting a new sysadmin role?
 What should my 30/60/90 day objectives be?
 How should I “manage“ my manager eg. if there’s no structured 90 day on-boarding process, how do I create one? My experience at past roles has been varied, usually am told to read documentation, check the backlog & review the ticketing system to get familiar with common issues. I feel like there’s a better way to set myself up for success.
 I have the natural instinct to want to “fix everything“ and jump right in to the backlog to look productive. Is this a good idea or should I spend a few days/weeks understanding the environment? I want to be helpful but I don’t want to come off as a know-it-all who says everything needs to be changed. Also, I’m aware that some organizations want the end solutions but don’t want the pain of change, so it‘s never a simple process. I feel that starting with documentation may be a better start and mapping out how the IT infrastructure is designed, but not sure what’s next before getting in the weeds.
 I want to make a good impression and ramp up quickly. But I don’t want to set an expectation that I will work late because I need work/life balance to be physically & mentally healthy. Is it a bad look to go home on time when you’ve just started a new role.
  
Thank you for the advice!

 Please bear with me as my ineptitude may show. For history, most of my professional career has been in enduser support. Recently a colleague of mine left and encouraged me to apply for his old position as a network specialist.
 I took the time to relearn what i could and played in a simulated environment and did i ever learn the hard way how different real hardware vs simulation can be. Anyhow, to the question. During the interview we had to complete a skills test that was set up in a collapsed core configuration:
 Cisco catalyst 9500 as the core/distribution switch and a Cisco Catalyst 9300 as the access. One of the Objectives was to set up an etherchannel link between the distribution and access layer switches and using port channel 1 as the container. The directions were vague so I assumed they'd leave it up to the interviewee to choose PAgP or LACP so i opted to set each side to channel group mode on. When I tried to apply the configuration both the 9500 and 9300 spit out "command rejected" I forget the exact verbage. In the end, I ended setting the distribution switch to channel group mode active and the access switch to passive and the etherchannel relationship formed. My I'm just scratching my head as to why mode on was rejected.
 EDIT: fixed some grammar and verbage

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will try to make this explanation short. My company uses an old Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) that uses Java as part of its components. It is truly solely IE dependent for other reasons as well. I have established that over the last 4 years since I began here. I, of course sounded the alarm years ago to management repeatably that IE had an expiration date. They began the lengthy project of upgrading to a cloud version roughly a year ago. This project also is folding in two other ERP programs into this upgrade so you can imagine the huge amount of work going into this. We are projected to go live with this in May.
 I missed the announcement from Microsoft that they would be putting an arrow through the heart of Internet Explorer on Valentines day and I am just discovering users that have had it updated. Basically if you try to use IE it automatically redirects to Edge. The previous settings in Edge under settings>default browser" allowed you to disable the redirect. That is all gone now. I have tried uninstalling all the MS updates on their computers from Feb 14 to date. But none of them seem to give back the capability to use IE. It seems to be the version of Edge 110.0.1587.46 had the options available so that you could stop it from redirecting. Now under version 110.0.1587.89 they are gone. I am trying to find a way to roll this back and possibly stop a major work stoppage for my company. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Ya'll,
 I'm deploying DOT1X EAP-TLS port authentication with a fallback guest VLAN on Cisco Catalyst C3850 switches used for access to offices and shared workspaces. I've followed the Cisco guides and have the proof of concept system working.... mostly. I am running into an issue with DHCP after assignment to the guest VLAN. When authentication fails or times out the port is assigned to the guest VLAN. However the Windows DHCP service times out and self assigns an AIPA address before the DOT1X authentication failure/timeout occurs. The Windows machine will then sit on the Guest VLAN without an IP address for approximately 5 minutes before the Windows DHCP service reattempts a DHCP request and is successful.
 The reason I'm asking this here, is that I would like to adjust my switch configs to account for this since theoretically devices getting assigned to the guest VLAN won't be under my control to adjust Windows DHCP settings.
 Is there a best practice or recommended DOT1X auth timeout?
 The proof of concept is using this setup on the ports:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/X
 switchport mode access
 device-tracking attach-policy dot1x
 authentication event fail action authorize vlan 5
 authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 5
 authentication open
 authentication port-control auto
 authentication timer reauthenticate 180
 authentication violation replace
 dot1x pae authenticator
 dot1x timeout start-period 5
 dot1x timeout held-period 1
 dot1x timeout auth-period 18

 Today we've made changes to our VPN, so we need to rename the Service name in our fixvpn script, and therefore need to update the fixvpn.ps1 file.
 However, the only way I can get Group Policy to actually roll out the updated file is to set the Action to "Replace". This isn't ideal as it means that every time a computer runs gpupdate/logs in, it will download that file, and the "Apply once, do not reapply" setting doesn't seem to work with "Replace". I also have no idea how long a computer can go for without being booted up/signed in, so it's less of an 'enable and forget' thing.
 I even tried resaving the file under a different name temporarily, deleting the old file, and uploading the new file with the correct name, in case it was leaning on some kind of file ID or creation date, but still, the script remains unupdated.
 Am I really supposed to run this under "Replace" and have files copied over from SYSVOL every 90 mins?

Never seen it before and not sure if it is a router or device. Didn't find much about it online and was hoping someone might have any info. Thanks

 Is anyone else seeing increased latency for anything going to and from India to Europe?
 We have no real way to prove this as we are in Canada, but ever since the Earthquakes, some of our workers in India have been complaining about latency. Its not all the ISPs that seems to be affected, but the timing is almost spot on.
 Just wondering if you are seeing something similar? 
 In most cases we are seeing a 100ms to 150ms increase from the normal.

Mails are neither sent nor recieved. First user reported it on Monday, it was solved with 2 reboots, other user was solved with creating a new profile after the Outlook repair kicked in. But we also have two users where the local Office programs straight up do not work anymore. Word, Excel display the Yellow Warn symbol top right next to the profile pic. Also displaying the "Account Problem log in again" and when you click on it, the MS login/MFA windows appears with "Please wait" and closes. Sign-In protocols in Azure for the affected users are all successful. Even tried the Outlook repair thingy, which created a new profile, but after that we were not able to add the users account to Outlook. It just fails. For Excel and Word, when you try to open a File from SharePoint in the Desktop App, you get an access-denied error, when you say open it Excel/Word online no problem. According to MS support try to close all Office programs, delete all saved Windows Login Credentials regarding Office and OneDrive. But the affected users only have OneDrive creds stored, as I have both, so maybe this is a step torwards a solution.The Web "Variants" work without a problem for the affected ones, so it's a viable workaround atm.
 Infos: O365, Exchange Online, Hybrid Azure AD
 Maybe someone has the solution or some hint.Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just curious as I'm trying to, slowly, learn to use Wireshark properly. Some years ago I stayed in a big chain hotel in London next to the British Library. Bored in my room I did a network scan of the free WIFI they provided. To my horror I could see everyone else's device, even an old server I think they may not have been using anymore that appear to monitor temperatures. I reported this while there and they promptly locked everything down (essentially just turning on WIFI isolation).
 This time I'm on a cruise ship and not brought my Alfa card with me. Not done an nmap scan as I know about the legality of that. But thought running WIFI shark while I'm connected to check my on ship account shouldn't hurt. But noticed loads of MDNS entries at all the other guests devices. All their device names. Surely this shouldn't be visible if they had WIFI isolation on?
 Isn't this a slight security issue or am I making something of nothing because I'm just not understanding the Wireshark trace?

 Each switch has a port with the same vlan on it. At the end of each vlan is a PC with a 1gbNIC.
 ​
 When doing an iperf test between the PCs, my network monitoring software is suggesting that it is only saturating 1 link out of the two with about a gig of traffic.
 ​
 I was under the impression it would balance the load across the two? Or would this only happen if I was able to generate more than a gigworth of traffic?

 Any thoughts on reasons why I may want to install an agent to specifically backup AD?

 I understand that this is something very personal and every person values different things and priorities in their lives, but I would appreciate to get the feedback of some of you that made the jump (or did not made the jump), what played role on your decision and how did this turned out.
 Thank you and have a nice day

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm junior system administrator in small company and I've been given a task to redesign network topology since current one is quite awful. We just bought 2 Huawei 10Gb switches and 5 new servers with 4 10Gb NICs each. I'm not sure how I should set up the network core.
 I was thinking of stacking switches in master/slave configuration, then use LAG to connect my servers to the core. 4 servers' NICs bond into 1 logical NIC, and split 2/4 cables to one switch and the remaining 2/4 to the other. As I understand it, this should give me high redundancy (one whole switch can die and connection will still be ok) and high throughput (some traffic will come to main, some to secondary; total speed should be around 35-40Gb).
 ​
 Is this setup viable, am I going the right way, will it be manageable in the future?

 ​
 So I've been tasked with getting Dell BIOS on a fleet of Latitude laptops up to date as soon as possible. I've investigated several different methods and I've run into problems with each of them and wondered how others do this effectively.
 We're looking to deploy in a way which has no user input or action other than looking at the BIOS update screen for a little while which is fine - to computers which are already out in the field.
 ​
 We have:
 - BitLocker enabled on all computers
 - BIOS password enabled on all computers
 - Dell Latitude 7000 series
 ​

 Windows Update for Business
 -----------------------------
 I've investigated using Windows Update for Business which appears like a very good solution, as it doesn't required dealing with BitLocker suspension, or BIOS pas…]]></summary>

I've also had one user report the reverse where a load of emails have suddenly appeared.
 I assumed connection issues but this has been with a mix of on-site and remote workers so seems less likely.
 I thought it was probably an issue with MS and so had a search online expecting to see loads of people with the same issue, however that does not seem to be the case. 
 Has anyone else noticed this recently?

 So today was the first time in my professional life that I outright snapped.
 I got an email this morning regarding an external audit, and that the auditor requested access to specific documents within our organization, you know, standard stuff.
 In my ignorance, I thought that the user would simply share a OneDrive folder/make a team/create a Sharepoint site.... or at least call me for help... but oh no...
 I got an email stating "I solved the issue, and we now have a Dropbox account with all the sensitive info publicly available, have a nice day"
 I never thought I got get this angry with a user, but here we are...
 I promptly called said user, deleted the documents, deleted Dropbox (considered deleting the user from existence), create a OneDrive folder with said documents and shared it with only the auditors.
 While this was going on, the user kept saying that it was my fault that the user was forced to use Dropbox, that the user could not bother to ask me for simple stuff like this and that the user did not receive any formal IT training in all the years the user had been alive, which also was my fault.
 You can guess how my reaction to this barrage of BS went... 
 I hope you all had a better morning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just read this article: https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/2017/03/virtual-machine-vcpu-and-vnuma-rightsizing-rules-of-thumb.html
 The examples at the end make it clear how I should rightsize my VMs to align with the physical host. The problem is, we have clusters with ESXi hosts with different # Cores and different # Sockets. For example, in one cluster we have a host with 6 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620), 8 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz) and 12 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz). 
 The cluster is EVC enabled with at Intel® "Sandy Bridge" Generation. These CPUs typically have 1-4 Cores. (4-6 Extreme, 2-8 Xeon).
 I'm a bit confused how I align my vCPUs in this example. I would assume I align with the host with the least amount of cores, so 6. Btw, we are running ESXi 7.0.3.
 Example 1: VM with 4 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 1 socket with 4 cores 
 Example 2: VM with 8 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 2 sockets with 4 cores 
 Example 3: VM with 16 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 4 socket with 4 cores 
 Am I getting this right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 after 9 years in IT, I had my big upsi moment.
 I was setting up a new WSUS in an environment. It was planned to rollout monthly updates in 4 rings. Test, Auto update 1, Auto update 2, manual update. So far so good. Created the gpo and put the servers in the group.
 Well, yesterday it happened... The downloaded 02.2023 Update was downloaded the day after patchday. So far so good. Only the servers within the Test group installed it. BUT then yesterday, every server just went to the WSUS, installed the updates and rebooted automatically. Even the ones that are in the manual group.
 ​
 The thing that confuses me the most is
  
I put in a time, when the servers should NOT restart --> get's ignored
 The updates were planned to be installed at the end of this week + next week
 No matter if I put the "Configure automatic update" GPO to option 4 (auto download, install and reboot to schedule) or to option 3 (auto download notify for install), they'll always immediately download and install them.
  
I have no clue what's wrong and tried to re-create this behavior in my LAB. So far I don't run into the same issue...
 ​
 Will have a review later today. Guess I better prepare to get a new job...

Atm, we have antiquated group polices setup on about 100 workstations (used by medical staff) that the county IT people refuses to fix and frequently interrupts work. I have a big meeting with every manager involved and some changes could happen due to finger pointing between us contractors and county officials. 
 Essentially my wishlist would be to have county setup a separate domain controller with no original scripts running, so I can implement what I see fit. 
 I believe all I would need access to is a server connected to countydomain2 correct? 
 I should have no issue swapping user profiles from one domain to the other. I also believe that they will still be able to access their original county controlled emails via outlook correct? 
 Am I going about this completely wrong or is there something I'm missing?

 currently in our production we have a special vlan for cnc machines and a special vlan for clients in the production. Most of the machines are using SMBv1 (you cant change that, because most of them are too old) and I want to implement a SMBv1 Proxy for this.
 The clients access the machines directly over SMBv1 to their network shares to integrate or remove the production files on the machine.
 Unfortunately I dont have the real time to get in the topic so I'm searching for a company which could do that and also maintain this solution (most important part). 
 Any idea of companies which do that kind of "production" things?

Used to be able to remove a few things, run a couple rounds of windows updates and throw on the domain and it was fine. Seems like for the last couple years we always have to reimage the laptop. If we don’t we have issues with the CPU maxing out at 100% on weird built in system processes. Anyone else see that and/or have a solution for It. It’s also weird that we don’t have to do it on the desktops we get from them.
 For reference we’re a relatively small shop and don’t have put out a ton of laptops all the time. I’d say 2-3 a month. If we didn’t have to do a full reimage, we typically install office 365, sophos AV, ninja RMM client, forticlient VPN, run a round or two of windows updates then add the computer to the domain. I also run Dell command update and remove optimizer.
 Just looking for any suggestions other than reimage them every time. I’ve built MDT servers in the past so I know that’s an option, but don’t think i do enough computers to justify the time investment yet.

 But.. I’ve got this client with an assortment of printers. All 5+ years old, some are Xerox Phaser, some HP LJs, they all suck. One phaser says MPC error randomly until you reboot it. One LJ has black streaks (client buys knockoff toner because apparently the legit stuff is too expensive), another LJ prints rainbow like all the cartridges leaked. One HP LJ ghosts images / print. My recommendation is to replace them, or go with MFPs that are proper and under a support contract, but the client just expects me to magically fix all these. 
 Is this a legitimate frustration, or is this something an experienced IT admin should be able to do, and do I just suck?

 Always been slow on our 5516 and expected much better speed through the new firepower but not much improvement at all.
 Full tunnel (not split tunnel).
 Expect a bit of overhead but whew not that much....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 I have always been confused with the retention policies in M365. So hopefully someone here can clarify this for me. 
 If you enable retention policy to retain all data indefinitely in M365 via Microsoft 365 Data Lifecycle Management so it applies globally to all M365 apps (exchange, onedrive, sharepoint etc.). What happens if you disable a user account and remove the license?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users One Drive?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users emails? I know its not going to create inactive mailbox but can you still search the emails from/to this users via eDiscovery?
 - What happens after 30 days, 60 days or 90 days when the standard Microsoft retention period (outside M365 Data Lifecycle Management) expires? Will the data get deleted or will the retention policy kick in and all data will still be available via eDiscovery?
 The key here is, I dont care about restoring user data, it is more for compliance/legal purposes so as long as their data is searchable and can be found within e-discovery, I am happy.
 I keep getting conflicting messages from few M365 consultants. Some saying you need to delete the account when the license is still intact otherwise retention policy wont kick in. Others are saying it should apply the retention policy setup globally regardless. I dont want to find it the hard way so im just gathering some information here and there while waiting an official answer from M$.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are the facts of the situation:
  
We are an MSP with a central office that has a backup appliance.
 
Our customers' servers send data backups to this appliance daily. 
 
Our office and all customers have static IP public IPv4 addresses.
 
Data comes in on TCP 35116 and 35117 which is port forwarded to our backup appliance (see below before you gasp :)
 
 Here is what we do to secure this
  
The office firewall drops all inbound traffic on 35116 and 35117 (actually all ports) unless it is coming from a customer IP address. We maintain an alias in our firewall for customer IP addresses
 
Backup files are encrypted with a 2048bit key as they are generated at the customer site. They cannot be read without this key
 
The connection itself is TLS from the customer server to the backup appliance
 
The backup client at the customer sites must have a seperate 2048bit key in order to connect and have Read/Write access to the backup appliance
 
The backup appliance is off domain and uses a separate set of credentials from anything else
 
  
Here is the debate.
 A coworker is pretty insistent that we should be running these connections over a VPN of some sort. Either OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec maybe. I have countered that since the backups themselves are encrypted AND are being sent over TLS, this is not necessary and would harm performance.
 What do you think? Is adding a site-to-site VPN (with appropriate firewall rules and controls) to this setup worthwhile?

 maximum 14
 write-memory
 I assume this is due to the path, can the standby switch write to flash? or can it not handle the $h variable? I want to set up local config change logging and backups at the very least, because the network team for this org has let it all go to hell, and now I have to fix everything and do it myself, hell they didn't even set up SNMP properly, all the network devices are using RADIUS servers half way around the world away when we have some locally... just a mess.
 Any advise on maybe setting up better management of the local devices is welcome as well, maybe there is an open source solution I can run locally to at least manage the configs?

 I manage at max, maybe 50 computers and 25 servers actively and it gets hard sometimes. I use a mix of AnyDesk for personal machines, Mesh Central, and traditional RDP for more business related systems. 
 Sometimes ensuring systems are up to date, secured, deployed correctly, configured with up to date information, etc gets really difficult, I wanna know how y'all do it. 
 I have deployed some servers that run by themselves pretty okay; they provide the services they need too and do it well. They auto update, and I automated some of the trivial tasks. But some machines, I feel like I can't leave alone or else they will become problematic. I want to know how y'all manage these kinds of systems or manage a fleet in general. 
 I don't even have 100 machines and it seems to be overwhelming at times.

 I've been working with FTDs as well as Checkpoints and Palos for a few years and everywhere I look (especially this sub lol), I can see frequent jokes about the FTD platform.
 I mean, I kinda get it, the platform didn't start out well and was a hot mess until recently when they managed to catch up a bit in my eyes. But when I read the discussions, it seems to me that everybody thinks it's a completely wasteful investment to any deployment.
 So what do you guys think? Is it still that bad as everyone says?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a heads-up: Contrary to chatter on the Internet and Microsoft's own patch notes, I have now confirmed the Secure Boot problem caused by KB5022842 (the February 2023 update for Windows Server 2022) also affects installations other than on VMware.
 I have two machines that are running Server 2022 on bare metal, and that are now refusing to boot due to Secure Boot failure. Other machines appear to be unaffected. The two in question boot after Secure Boot is disabled. Both happen to be older desktop-class computers used for software testing purposes, but I wouldn't put money on this problem only affecting non-server class hardware. (HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Mini, Lenovo M93p Tiny; confirmed that both have the latest firmware available.)
 As others have noted, the problem only shows itself on the second reboot after KB5022842 is installed.
 Be careful! I'd be willing to bet that this problem affects a lot more machines than is currently being reported. Might be worth pre-emptive testing to ensure a panic doesn't ensue if Server 2022 machines need to be restarted in the course of business before this problem is fixed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the early 2010s when was but a young Sysadmin I went to an architecture office with roughly a dozen users, one switch, Linksys router\wifi (you know... normal stuff) and We were upgrading them to a POE switch, IP phones, business grade router, new PCs, monitors, the whole network in a box sales job. Everything was pretty normal until I noticed everyone was watching me as I entered "Bobs office" just to see my reaction. 
 Bob was a special kind of hoarder. Bob liked his paper. Blueprints, White plotter blueprints, Legal sized paper, A4 for some reason, and normal Printer paper. You would think this is normal... and you would be wrong. Bob had this paper from print jobs EVERYWHERE. My words cannot easily describe what I mean by EVERYWHERE. The entire floor.... white paper. Every surface in the office, paper with an avalanche of paper drifting down to the floor... His chair HAD PAPER IN IT with some weird blueprint rolls off the back of the chair making a backrest. I have no idea if his desk was wood or metal because all I saw was paper avalanching off of the 2 sides of the desk not against the wall all the way down to the floor. His monitors were sat on mounds of paper and I had to remove the paper FROM ONTOP OF HIS KEYBOARD!!! Mentally picture fresh powder on a mountain ready for skiing, but replace the snow with paper, this was his entire office, floor to nearly celling. The door would not close because of the 3+ inches of paper on the floor. A normal box of printer paper is 5,000 sheets. His office easily had 500,000 sheets of paper in it, and that may be a conservative estimate because I am over here doing math on how much volume that many sheets of paper would be, and its still not enough. 
 When I left the office I played it cool and asked when their last inspection from the Fire Marshall was, the Office Managers face got red and she mumbled something about having "Bob pick up after himself".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am extremely interested in automating some tedious manual tasks I preform on a monthly basis.
 I know a little bit of powershell (I know a little python too) and I have been attempting some test scripts working up towards my actual automation project.
 I'm open to delving into Python or Powershell if any of you experienced automaters think I will have a much easier time of things with one or the other.
 Now this is a windows environment (If powershell didn't make that obvious lol) and I am running into all sorts of permissions and security issues.
 ​
 The eventual goal is to have a script (When does a script turn into a program lol) that can go out to multiple PCs on my network, check the version of an application against the version I specify, and then run an .exe if the version is previous.
 So obviously a program roaming around the network launching executables is not something Windows appreciates.
 ​
 I'm just playing in a test environment at the moment, but I'm starting to have doubts about how anything I ever write would be able to be ran in prod due to security factors.
 ​
 Am I missing something here? I do NOT come from a coding background, I'm more of a Windows/Networking generalist. I feel like learning to automate is a really good step in my career so I want to push myself to learn this. I think there might be a few concepts I'm missing that would make this "click" for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if anybody has any real world experience with this combination of devices. We're in the process of upgrading from our old 5508 controllers (and 2700/2800 series APs) to a pair of 9800-L WLCs with 9115 APs. Nothing new is in production yet, we're still in the planning phase, and we're trying to figure out how difficult this will be (we're in a manufacturing environment where some sites work 3 shifts and almost never shut down).
 According to this compatibility matrix, it should work. Here's a screenshot of the relevant section.
 I've got one of the 9800s online and I've got a spare 2702 AP that I'm testing with. I've installed 17.3.4c to the WLC installed the specific AP firmware from the table but so far I haven't been able to get them to talk. This very well could be user error so far since I'm not that familiar with this thing yet.
 I'm just wondering if anybody can confirm these work together. This would be much easier if we could just swap out the controllers with the existing APs in place and then swap out the APs one by one (we've got the controllers but the APs aren't due to ship for several months yet). Otherwise this will get convoluted quickly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Number matching is a key security upgrade to traditional second factor notifications in Microsoft Authenticator. We will remove the admin controls and enforce the number match experience tenant-wide for all users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications starting May 8, 2023. We highly recommend enabling number matching in the near term for improved sign-in security. Relevant services will begin deploying these changes after May 8, 2023 and users will start to see number match in approval requests. As services deploy, some may see number match while others don't. To ensure consistent behavior for all users, we highly recommend you enable number match for Microsoft Authenticator push notifications in advance.”
 The AAD Admin portal still shows Feb. 27th though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been fighting with this for a few days and am wondering if anyone else has a Dell N3048P using TACACS to hit Clearpass. I haven't been able to find anything searching around on forums or on Aruba/Dell support pages. I believe the issue is with my Dell's AAA configuration. I've tried several variations but nothing has seemed to get past CPPM to hit the Access Tracker. I have services built out for Cisco, Aruba, and Brocade with no issues. 
 CPPM is showing a "warn" in the event viewer for a failed TacacsServer request. "Authorization request for unauthenticated user = blahblahblah". The device is added to CPPM and a device group. I changed the secret in CPPM and then started receiving an error about the secret having a mismatch so that isn't an issue.
 Dell AAA config:
 aaa authentication login "defaultList" enable local tacacs
 aaa authentication login "tacacs" enable local tacacs
 aaa accounting commands "dfltCmdList" start-stop tacacs
 aaa accounting commands "1" start-stop tacacs
 aaa accounting commands "15" start-stop tacacs
 aaa authorization exec "dfltExecAuthList" local tacacs
 ​
 I'm mainly curious if anyone has this setup on their network and might have an easy answer for me. I'm about to call Aruba TAC but I doubt they are going to do anything since the issue seems to be with Dell which we no longer have support on.

 The intent was to use PBR on the new L3 so that subnets could be moved from using the Legacy L3 as their default gateway one at a time, so that the associated VIPs and rules on the Legacy Firewall could be moved individually rather than in one large cut-over migration.

 Long story short, I'm distributing routes with a peer from another company but I'm unable to use AS paths to reliably determine upstream route preferences. The only way I've found is to subnet sizes to determine the preferred path, but I'm currently limited to advertising /31 routes that peer. Since the other company is massive, it takes a lot of effort and paperwork for them to make changes, I'd rather do this on our end if possible.

 Most of the issued certificates we've already revoked. The only ones left now are certificates issued to the domain controllers via the domain controller template. 
 What would be the cleanest way to remove AD CS since the root CA doesn't exist anymore and more important what would be the impact on the domain controllers if we revoke those certificates or remove AD CS.

 Fine, I'll click on the Bypass events. Nope, not in there. Ok, where else could it be? Not sure, let me back to the main page and click through every event category.
 Is there a way to see all events and I can just ctrl + f to search for the one I need?
 I am remote to this site and the alerts are being sent every 2 min.
 In about 5 minutes I'll be logging into the switch and disabling the port that the APC plugs in to or just disable the email server notifications on the APC until power is restored.

 I plan to do the main migration over the weekend, then test it for a few days before doing an incremental migration of any other files changed or added over them few days. 
 In the new SP 365 migration bit how do I do incremental migration?
 Is it a case of running the same migration tasks again and it will just pickup changes, or do I need to set the "migrate files modified / created" setting in the task settings??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins. 
 We’ve encountered a tricky situation at one of our customers and are out if ideas. The problem is the following: 
 We got Azure ADDS setup and a AVD server in the environment.
 Each day the users have to sing in to Office, Teams, Onedrive and so on which gets a bit frustrating. Since the server is just AzureAD joined and we have no way to issue hybrid functionality for SSO through an ADDS-server the users get no primary refresh token for SSO after Windows sign in.
 We’ve been investigating how we can overcome this with no luck other then installing an ADDS-server to setup Hybrid join on to hybrid join the AVD-server. We see this as an absolute last resort and would like to make this work with the current setup. 
 Have any of you encountered this issue? Any ideas how to proceed with the current setup or are we out of luck?

 I'm trying to find some information about the upcoming release of the new Windows LAPS, specifically if this will be included natively into Windows 10 machines or only Windows 11 and beyond.
 On the MS overview page, they state:
 "Windows LAPS is supported on desktop Windows, Windows Server, and Windows Server Core. Windows LAPS is a native Windows feature on all supported SKUs. No extra steps are required to install the feature.
 As noted earlier, Windows LAPS currently is available only in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25145 and later."
 Does anyone know if Windows 10 will see this, or would this just be a MS incentive to push companies towards migrating to Windows 11?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, we are looking at refitting some of our meeting rooms. Our original set up was completed on a bit of a budget and with zero time, we have an Intel NUC mounted behind a TV with a standard Windows 10 install. We then run a Jabra speaker/mic device under the floor that pops out on top of the desk. We also have a webcam mounted ontop of the TV. 
 Joining a meeting is super simple, you enter a pin to unlock the PC, Teams is set to auto open to the calendar upon login and you just click Join on your meeting. Its basically just a standard PC plugged into a TV with an external mic/speaker and webcam.
 We are being asked to look at some teams meeting rooms, which personally I dont think is necessary because the meeting rooms themselves work fine. We are just looking to splash some cash since we have some left over come tax time.
 My main concern is, during meetings no one wants to use their work laptop to share their screen in big presentations. They just put their powerpoint on a network share and run it off the NUC, but they still like to use their personal machines to share their just for quick bits and peices like <4 quick catchups. If this even possible with a Teams meeting using something like a logitech tap? Or do you HAVE to share your screen using your personal machine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Not sure if this exists yet, but can we create an International BGP community standard or something along those lines for advertising your prefixes so we know what Country/State/Province/Region/etc your prefixes are located?
 We operate a latency sensitive network and have to constantly filter certain prefixes from being learnt via certain AS' so they have optimal routing and it is a tedious task. 
 This is where I had the idea that surely there had to be a better way and the first thing that came to my head is BGP communities that will identify the Country/State/Province/Region/etc. For example, an ASN with the 123.123.123.0/24 prefix in Japan Hokkaido Region can have a BGP community of 11:1 announced with their prefix. 11 being the Country (Japan) and 1 being the Hokkaido Region. (Side note: I really hope we end up giving Japan 11 as their BGP community code as a *tips fedora* to Code Geass).
 I'll admit this is not fully thought through yet and I wanted to open up the discussion to the networking community to hear their thoughts. The first issue I can forsee is AS' that strip BGP communities. In my head this International BGP community standard would be most useful in IXs.
 TLDR; If you operate an ASN can you advertise your prefixes with a BGP community that will identify the Country:/State/Province/Region/etc? An International BGP community codes standard for the BGP communities would be great.

 I'm working for small-medium company that have had it's IT processes really messed up before we came and implemented Azure AD, Intune, Office365 etc. Asset management in the past was just an excel spreadsheet that is not accurate anymore. This company has offices in different countries but, ultimately, the main one is in UK. What finance needs is to have a direct link between the invoice that came with the laptop or monitor for example, who has it assigned now and ultimately, they want to have to option to see the cost in GBP even if the laptop was bought in Morocco for example, using MAD as a currency. Depreciation in the app is also a must have
 ​
 Is there any web app that can do asset management with regards to this specific financial details? I was looking at BlueTally but i don't know if it can have multiple currencies or something like that.
 ​
 Any info would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was having trouble with a Laserjet printer (smearing on left side of the page). I think it might be the imaging drum but it still shows as 60% and I dont want to spend a ton of money without making sure what the issue is. Checked the warranty on HP's site, still good. To get the support phone number, the page says I have to signup (red flag #1), so I ignored that, and found the number somewhere else.
 Called the local line, got the song and typical excuse that "We are experiencing long queue yada yada". After picking the printers department and waiting for a while the phone system said "We have a faster moving line, if you speak english, press x". Since English is not a problem, I went there.
 A lady picks up, listens to my problem and says she can't help because they don't deal with printers (red flag #2). Wants to give me a long phone number (unrecognizable to me) and refuses to say which country it belongs to, so how can I use it? (red flag #3)
 Realizing she has no idea where I'm calling from, I explain how I reached there, including the fact that I speak 2 languages, to which she says "Wow, you're so talented!". This is the part that I'm still laughing about.
 The whole conversation was weird, little bit condescending and silly. To me this is all kind of hilarious because I didn't expect anything better than this when calling HP 😂

Sometimes it just hangs for a long time loading the page or after entering credentials. I have even seen it hang indefinitely or just timeout. Intune/Azure/365/company portal are also slow or just never loads. Most of the time if I just refresh the page it works fine the second time.
 I have seen this issue happening many different phones and computers so I know it isn't anything device related.
 Is anyone else noticing this? I have been noticing the issue for months and it isn't going away. Some days are better than others, but it happens pretty much every day.

 ​
 - It is possible to open the task manager
 - The "show more details" bottom left is enabled
 - All other sections (performance, startup, details etc.) are working correctly
 - The startup folders in ProgramData/User session folder are created
 - /sfc scannow didn't change anything
 - When I connect with my own session, the processes are showing, so it's definitely from the user session... 
 ​
 Any other ideas ? My final solution is to delete the user's session and to let him create it again but he has a lot of favorites, shortcuts so this is more annoying... 
 ​
 Thanks ! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to create a captive portal with different restriction per user account/role (student and teacher). 
  
The Teacher can have unrestricted access.
 The Student have restricted access. (only defined/allowed websites are accessible).
  
But upon my research/review on OpnSense Captive Portal Documentation, This is not possible because you can only configure firewall/captive portal settings per port/interface. In short, 1 Zone is 1 Interface.
 I cannot modify the infrastructure/wiring or add another Wi-Fi access points since It's already installed and running. I can only configure them.
 So my plan is: 
  
Setup 2 VLAN ID's (Interface) on a single physical ethernet port on OpnSense that is connected to the Wifi Access Points.
 Create two Captive Portals on OpnSense that uses the 2 VLAN Interface I created.
 Configure the Wifi Access Points to two SSID's (Teacher Wifi & Student WiFi) and attach each SSID to specific VLAN ID I setup on OpnSense.
 Configure OpnSense Website Filtering on the Student Wifi VLAN Interface.
  
To be honest, these are just my theories. I don't really know if this is a feasible or good workaround/setup. This is my first time in network setup/engineering. Please bear with me.
 All I want to know is, Is this kind of setup possible Please give me some tips/suggestions on how I can do it better. Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody,
 I can't figure out why some signed official binaries downloaded from internet are blocked by SmartScreen (with no possibility to force approval). For example,
 - if i download "ConEmu" from the official website, the binary has a valid certificate chain where the root CA is in the trusted roots of the computer. This prompts the Smartscreen. If i "unblock" the file from properties i can run it.
 - i download "notepad++" from the official website as well, valid certificate chain with trusted root. This doesn't prompt smartscreen, directly UAC...
 Can someone explain this behavior ? I could see that the trigger of smartscreen is the "zone identifier" of the executable, but as told in the example, both of these were downloaded from the internet... 
 Also, how can i check the zone identifier of an executable?
 Thanks!

At first i checked them frequently manually, there are too much devices for this.
 Now i am searching for a small software, i would love to have a portal to see which devices are out of date. Priority is for windows updates and upgrades, third party software would be a bonus.
 Do you have any suggestions for me? The devices just have a connection to 4 terminal server, so the communication needs to be done over the normal internet.
 Im excited to hear about your opinions.

The teams message notification sound rings a billion times a day and my personal phone is being called by random employees who somehow has my number. Even when i have lunch, i lock my office door yet people are trying to rip off the handle it seems like to get inside. 
 Right now i have 4 huge problems i'm trying to fix at once because they're all urgent last call things they need by the end of the week. One with fiber infrastructure, one with a cisco switch being unstable, one with Vmware and one with a WDS Server. They're all problems that requires a somewhat lenghty amount of troubleshooting and configuration. 
 I'm trying my best but these people constantly send me passive aggressive messages asking when it's done and why it's not working. I'm trying my fucking best and i just want to scream. I'm currently so fucking overloaded by anxiety i just shut down and i'm now in the server room to just get a moment of peace. I still feel my phone vibrate and my heart jumps everytime it does. 
 Please remove this if it's not within the rules to post, but i just needed someone to vent to. I have a job interview next week and that job has ZERO user support. So i hope i can get away from this shithole ASAP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am trying to make a decision based on the fact that i am so over tech support right now
 I am currently a junior sysadmin with experience in PowerShell scripting and very basic programming knowledge in website development. Lately, I have been contemplating a career move to become a software developer. I am looking for advice on whether this move is worth it and what skills or experience I should have to make it happen.
 I have enjoyed my time as a sysadmin, but I am looking for a career that is more fulfilling and flexible. My main goal is to start a business one day as soon as possible, and I am wondering which career path will be more advantageous in this regard. I am starting to enjoy building things, and I am concerned that being a sysadmin will mostly be a tech support role until I get into management. I also can't see how any sysadmin skills will help in business/side hustles until it gets bit enough to need storage and automation. Whereas i feel like building small apps and implementations is possible to do on the side at least if i was to understand development
 I was considering doing a 6 – 10 month bootcamp to help transition, but am also considering other options. What are the key differences between being a sysadmin and a software developer? And most importantly, which career path will be more beneficial for starting a business or work for myself in the future, sysadmin/devops route or software development?
 Lastly, holding me back from making this move is that I have recently landed a role as a lone systems admin and have okay money now (90k AUD) and am enjoying 20% of the work (building/scripting things) and the title. Does it get much better? I am worried about losing the stability and the title of my current role, but I also know that sys admin skills aren’t really transferable to many starting out businesses and side hustles.
 I appreciate any advice or insight. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a remote site that is connected to my DC via a Juniper SRX firewall that's establishing a site-to-site tunnel to another SRX in the DC. The remote site is on a cable internet circuit. At all my sites, including the remote site, 802.1X with EAP-TLS is used for both wireless and wired auth. This has been working great for months, until my ISP changed which backbone on their network my DIA connection runs across. No other changes were made anywhere other than the provider's backbone that's delivering the DIA circuit.
 The IP address of the SRX in the DC didn't change and the tunnel is still up and working. I can't find any evidence of issues with the tunnel, except .1X doesn't work anymore. On the NPS servers in the DC, event viewer shows that auth requests are coming in from the switch and AP at the remote site, but it almost seems like the .1X requests are getting mangled across the site-to-site tunnel. The same NPS servers service .1X for hardwired and wireless clients across several other sites connected via the ISP's MPLS without issue.
 Event viewer shows that auth requests from the AP at the remote site get logged as event id 6274 "The RADIUS Request message that Network Policy Server received from the network access server was malformed." Auth requests from hardwired ports from the remote switch show that rather than the computer name with a certificate, the request shows the client trying to auth with its mac address as the username and PAP and summarily denied.
 A tech at the ISP that made the backbone change and I have been beating our heads against the wall for a few days now with no progress. I've resorted to installing wireshark on the NPS server to try to find differences between known-good auth packets and broken packets, but haven't found an obvious difference yet. Would anyone happen to know how a seemingly innocuous change could bork .1X in such a bizarre way?

For example, if i was on a video call, i would have a backup internet connection within 10-20 seconds, EXCEPT i would have to re-start the call. its not seamless.
 I'm not sure where the new IP is getting assigned and where to fix it. I found on google lots of stuff about setting up a "floating IP address" that would duplicate the information from the old IP and send it to the new address thats coming from the 4G LM1200.
 Any assistance? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're looking to get a 20G MPLS circuit for a site in Asia. Our preferred carrier can meet this requirement and the pricing is fine, but it was mentioned that their backbone serving this particular country is basically a heap of 10G links.
 We often have to send huge files internationally, which can easily saturate a 20G circuit. Should I be worried that the carrier's backbone is Nx10G? Would something like traffic arriving out of order due to asymmetric routing be a potential issue?
 What kind of questions should I be asking them before we pull the trigger? I have full access to their network engineering team but I'm finding it hard to articulate my questions so that I don't receive bullshit answers.

 Does anyone happen to have old Nortel Optera manuals / management software hiding in their personal archives? 
 I have a network history lab that I am trying to bootstrap and I am needing to activate some Optera gear (5100 in particular).
 I worked with the Optera platforms in the early days but I cannot locate my PDFs or software archives for them.
 I know that Optera IP went to Ciena - but I had moved out of optical by that point - so I don't have a relationship with them.
 I am hoping that being many years out of date - some of this would be available without too much fuss. 
 This is a completely non-commercial exercise - just trying to restore some items from my past as a hobby (I have the hardware, just no software/docs).
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, R2D2 can be seen plugging in to download additional plans to the Death Star. One sees R2D2 in the screen for approximately 80 seconds before we see him again in frame, disconnected from the terminal. I contend R2D2’s dongle is capable of yottabit speed.
 The hard drive used to store the plans allegedly held 512 million exanodes of space, as depicted in Star Wars Rogue One. This would therefore be 512 yotta nodes if one follows the metric naming convention for numerical prefixes.
 General (poor) assumptions: (1) R2D2 spent all 80 seconds downloading the plans to the Death Star (2) the plans to the Death Star and its build history downloaded filled up the drive (3) a bit is equivalent to a node (4) no q-bit fuckery is afoot and (5) the plans are uncompressed.
 512/80 is 6.4 yottabit/second throughput.

 Then when the client opens their application an error comes up with the IP:8081/Server which is the server,port,share that is open for that application.
 I dont know if this is correct but I made a Port Foward rule form OpenVpn port 1194 to forward to the internalIP:8081 (ServerApplication)
 Am I configuring this correctly or how do I go about it? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Within the last couple of days I had setup a DFS Namespace on a domain controller and DFS Replication to replicate a shared folder from one file server to another. During the course of that initial replication copy, there was a root folder on the same drive where the shared folder was being replicated to and that root folder is now gone. Backups were not in production at the time as the server was still being configured. Replication only went one direction (Old Server to New Server) for one folder and its sub folders (IE D:\SharedFolder\FolderShares1-6 and User Redirected Folders). this was done as a form of migration of the file servers. 
 Now that the folder is gone, I am wondering why would DFS remove that folder if it was not part of the replication. I am also now running into issues where users are denied access to their User Redirected Folders, which still reside on the old File server and are managed via GPO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a retirement facility. I got off a call today with our ISP (A very well known massive cable/internet/phone provider, but not comcast) where they casually mentioned (after we threatened to go in house) that we must use their managed Wi-Fi MDU solution, they wont just give us an internet pipe for us to do it in-house. 
 They said the Business or Enterprise divisions will not give us a connection for residential use and if they see that we're trying to use it for our residents they will cut us off.
 There's literally no other ISP that services the area except for T1 DSL or Starlink business. 
 Does this make any sense? They're essentially forcing us to use their managed service which we hate and want to get rid of. 
 How can this be legal? What about all those news stories of some people in neighborhoods becoming their own ISP by buying a business class modem and then re-selling it with some kind of mesh system to the neighbors?

 There’s been a few red flags (100s of dormant AD accounts, Azure servers running but not used for anything, etc) all minor things I could chalk up to unintentional or old MSP shenanigans. One frustration mentioned when I started is the migration from the previous MSP is only now being wrapped up by the new MSP, a year later. All these things I again can chalk up to scheduling, waiting for resources, etc. 
 What I do need a sanity check on is the slowness of response for requests of 1) documentation and network diagrams, 2) quotes for new projects, and 3) a lack of interest in consolidating/disabling portions of Azure infrastructure.
 For example, I requested a rough estimate for five projects 8 business days ago. By no means detailed SoWs, just a rough number for budget setting. Or waited nearly three weeks for documentation and still no response beyond confirmation of receipt.
 Is this type of non-responsiveness expected? What is considered a quick turn-around for these types of requests? Feel like I’m going crazy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow sysadmins,
 Our organization relies heavily on Microsoft Word VBA Macros to generate and live-edit Word documents. They were hand-made about 15 years ago, and the original authors are gone. Our sysadmins can maintain with minor edits as needed, but aren't really tasked for making new, complex workflows should the need arise.
 In googling, I found that Microsoft released "Office Scripts" in 2020. By "Office Scripts", Microsoft really meant, "Excel Online Scripts". Have not seen any indication of scripting being extended into Word.
 Is there any successor, alternative, or replacement to Word VBA Macros? Seems kind of weird for a technology from 1993 to have no replacement 30 years later.
 Thanks for any insight you may have.

My admin is gung-ho about physically moving drops from punch to punch when certain people move to a different desk within the one building in the company, and re-punching is uncomfortable to say the least, painful normally.
 So my question is it normal to move drops to different panels so that they can be plugged into another switch? This happens a fair amount (including, "condensing the drop") and I thought to ask.

 My most recent discovery is that we are paying $865 a month (before taxes and fees) for our copy machine (only one) that only sees moderate use. It took me days and about a dozen calls and I finally got ahold of my account rep and the explanation is my predecessor continued to roll over their lease agreement about 2 years early over and over and we have been with them for 30 years so the previous amount due was also rolled over.
 The summary is that we pay almost 1,000 a month for the next 63 months (the contract was signed only a few months ago). To break it we would have to pay over $55,000 for a copier machine that would cost about $8,000 to buy.

 If anyone has any advice or experience with this kind of situation any input would help. 
 Again reminder I did not sign this contract!! This is just one of many insane contracts signed here by my moronic predecessor. I always read the fine print.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cant seem to get this network configuration working.
 Two routers are on the same network. 
 (site to site VPN to another RV325) WAN > RV325 > (LAN 192.168.15.1) 
 (OpenVPN) WAN > RV260 > (LAN 192.168.15.2) 
 DHCP is disabled on both. Running a DHCP server on a 2016 DC.
 ​
 I just added 192.168.15.2 to the scope of the DHCP just now hoping that will fix it.
 ​
 When I log into the OpenVPN RV260, I can't see anything on the network, why?
 The RV260 and RV325 are not compatible for site-to-site VPN, otherwise I would do it and remove the RV325 completely and this problem will go away. Howeverm I can't do that, so there has to be a fix for this. 
 ​
 Why when I log into the OpenVPN server on the RV260, I can't see any network devices? I can only ping devices with the Gateway of the router I am connected too. 
 ​
 This is bothering the crap out of me. 
 ​
 Please help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 Im hoping someone might be able to help me figure out an issue I am having configuring a Cisco switch.
 ​
 So, first, I am not Cisco certified and overall have very little experience configuring Cisco switches. 
 ​
 The issue that I am running into is kind of strange. I am not able to get to my firewall from one of my VLANS.
 ​
 My test environment is like this
 ​
 ​
 Switch 1 (core switch) 192.168.0.10
 Switch 2 (access switch) 192.168.0.11
 Switch 3 (access switch) 192.168.0.12
 Firewall 192.168.0.6
 ​
 PC1 192.168.0.100
 PC2 192.168.0.110
 PC3 192.168.3.110
 ​
 I can ping everything from both PC1, PC2 and the Core switch. 
 I can ping both PC1 and PC2 and the core switch from PC3, however, I cannot ping both access switches and the firewall from PC3.
 ​
 I have an SVI configured with the IP address 192.168.3.1 on VLAN 30 on my Core switch. 
 I have a computer plugged directly into port 4 on the Core switch, but I cannot ping firewall. 
 ​
 I have been reading article after article and I know I have to be missing something stupid here. 
 ​
 I thought maybe it was because I didn't have layer 3 enabled, so as a test, I even configured port 4 with the IP address 192.168.3.1 and enabled routing, but I still get the exact same results.
 ​
 I have a static route setup for 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 to forward traffic to 192.168.0.6 (firewall).
 I am able to get out to the internet from both PC1 and PC2 just fine, just not PC3.
 ​
 Furthermore, if I log into my switches web portal, I can switch to VLAN30 and I can ping out directly from the switch, but I still cannot ping either access switch or the firewall from the Core switch on VLAN30
 ​
 ​
 Any help would be so very gratefully appreciated. 
 Thank you so much in advance!
 Edit: Solved!

 I am wondering if anyone can give me any suggestions here. I have traffic coming into let's say VLAN10, hitting a firewall (I see this being passed), exiting via VLAN20, hitting the VLAN interface on ACI, and then not hitting the actual gateway of the destination subnet. 
 In a working traceroute I see: VLAN10 >> Firewall (static route out) >> ACI VLAN20 Interface >> Dest. Subnet Gateway >> Destination IP.
 Not working: VLAN10 >> Firewall (static route out) >> ACI VLAN20 Interface >> Timeout 
 Does anyone have any suggestions as to what can I check here? I am not very familiar with ACI. (The source is the same core router, different l3 vlans all taking the same path).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We currently control our L3 in our at&t’s avpn offering. We have gre (mGRE) tunnels and bgp feeding various services via afi to various sites. Some sites even have various other types of encryption. From my understanding, typically the site rtr does NOT have MPLS config, though we still have MPLS qos config on each site rtr, along with the hub having MPLS qos config. Our hub feeds into another MPLS network we own - after collectors - so I’d presume, if the marking is kept, that it could be used for our campus MPLS qos (I think that’s the teams thought here). However, peeling back the onion, it was revealed to me by AT&T, that each site doesnt necessarily have a COS profile ordered with them , which would explain some of the asymmetrical issues seen while traffic went through AVPN - maybe. My question is, if we are hopping around at layer 3 already, would MPLS markings still be seen or matter by AT&Ts underlay somewhere? Even with just the basic GRE traffic, I’d figure that qos markings would be copied over maintained? Right now, I think the profile not being set as being the problem / waste.
 At a higher level to this, it seems like there’s a possibility that whoever architected the design so that we control L3, traded off the QoS perk gained from MPLS. Hopefully not.

We are looking into VLANS to help alleviate our available IP issue, but as a quick fix to more immediately alleviate this issue.. Could we go to /22 and can we specify the next subnet? i.e. could we do 192.168.21.0/22 or does it have to be 192.168.3.0/22 (do the subnets need to increase incrementally or can they be manually defined)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Networking Gurus! 
 I had some recent network speed issues so I pulled out my trusty iperf3 to try and diagnose and I found something I am hoping you can help me with. I have a server in my office and other in my basement, about 75 feet of cable run between them. When I run iperf3 as the server on my basement linux (fedora) server and the client on my laptop I see lots (200,000+) of retr (retransmits). But when I do the reverse where the iperf3 server is in my office and the client is in the basement, I get few to no retr. This is very consistent, lots of retr going in one direction (office to basement) but few going the other way (basement to office). I have also run iperf3 server and client both on servers in my basement using the same switch as basement to office and that’s also pretty clean, few if any retr. 
 Does this point to a bad cable? Bad switch? Bad ends on the cables? What would you do to diagnose and clear this up?
 Thanks in advance for your wisdom and guidance!

 “They are suppose to check it monthly”
 Mind you these are office worker with high turn over. They either don’t know what to look for or did not receive proper training. Unless the apc panel changed, I don’t think it show the condition of the battery. No one knows when it’ll die.

But not everyone is affected and they are rarely the same issues across users.
 Just wondering if it's just our org or if MS has changed anything behind the scenes without checking if their apps still work afterwards (again...)

 I would like to setting up the SSSO to my organization but I don't know if it secure enough. I have an hybrid environment but without Azure AD-joined devices, my devices only joined to the on-premise AD. I followed the Microsoft documentation and I configured everything: Azure AD Connect, GPO and the Firewall. It is working very well with my test users. 
 My settings in a nutshell:
 Azure AD
  
Password hash sync
  
GPO (from Microsoft documentation)
  
Site to Zone Assignment List
 Allow updates to status bar via script
 SPNEGO (Firefox)
  
AZUREADSSO Computer Object on my on-premise AD
  
Storing object in OU where is securing against accidental deletion
 msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute set to AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
 Kerberos delegation is disabled on this object 
  
According to Microsoft documentation it is recommended to update the Kerberos decryption key at least on every 30 day.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso-faq#how-can-i-roll-over-the-kerberos-decryption-key-of-the--azureadsso--computer-account-
 I have not found anything about SSSO on the internet from a security perspective. Can cybercriminals exploit this SSSO capability or is it safe enough? I am wondering about on this because SSSO sends Kerberos ticket over the internet. I don't know if I should worry about that. Maybe I just overthinking.
 Does anyone have experience with Seamless Single Sign-On? Can you share your experience with me?
 Is there anything else I should be aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/sysadmin
 I'm curious how you all go about testing your backups? We have a medium/large sized environment with ~1000 VMs and a few physical servers (most SQL boxes) that we are backing up regularly. 98% Windows, a very select few Linux. However, we don't have a definitive process for testing these backups beyond requested restores that we have to do as people need them.
 Previously, I used Veeam's SureBackup feature to test backups at my previous job, but here we use Commvault and I don't see a similar feature. There does seem to be some sort of backup validation but Commvault's documentation doesn't match what I'm seeing in our console.
 Using Veeam's SureBackup as a model, I started to build out a sandbox network that would mirror our production network, which I could restore VMs into and then run scripts against them to verify they are working. The point I'm more or less stuck at is the "scripts to verify they are working" part. For basic Windows boxes I've got a script that checks for running services, and for all the VMs I'm pulling their reported heartbeat status by VMWare, but this is imperfect and doesn't cover some of our more specialized boxes like Exchange or SQL databases. 
 Somewhere along the line I think there will be a human element (IE, you are the admin for this server, your server is currently in the sandbox network, login to it and make sure everything works before it gets torn down) but I'd like to automate as much of this process as possible.
 What approach do you take? Is there a feature in Commvault I've missed or a third party tool that solves the problem? Or do you have better ideas on what to check using various scripts and the like?

 I need all the permissions to stay the same, just one group added with full access. I wrote a powershell script for this. 
 Is this the right approach? do you see anything wrong with this?
 $identity = 'domain\group' $rights = 'FullControl' $inheritance = 'ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit' $propagation = 'None' $type = 'Allow' $ACE = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule($identity, $rights, $inheritance, $propagation, $type) Get-ChildItem D: -Recurse -Directory | ForEach-Object{ $acl = get-acl -Path $_.FullName $acl.AddAccessRule($ACE) Set-Acl -Path $_.FullName -AclObject $acl }

 So I've been trying to think about my career in a 10-15 or maybe 15-20 year span. I know it's a controversial idea, but I look at the developments in the space and satellite industry and can't help but see this era as the verge of a massive breakout of space infrastructure. 
 So that got me thinking, what does an IT infrastructure look like to a space faring civilization when there are regular trips to a lunar colony? How would you deploy software to an MECM distribution point on the moon? How would you handle a Domain Controller in deep space?
 I've tried looking for early research on this idea without much success. Does anybody know of any reading material on the subject? Or possibly any writings on interfacing with a remote site that has unreliable or inconsistent communication times?

 ​
 currently facing issue with Huawei routers regarding netconf. I need to configure netconf on huawei devices, however i find that documentation on this subject is very limited and i couldn't find any usefull information.
 ​
 I have an AR2200 router with firmware version from 2020 (V200R010), and according to this document, netconf should be somehow available on this device but i'm just not able to configure it in any way, nor am i able to connect to it with the netconf protocol (using -p 830 or -s netconf).
 ​
 Is anyone familiar with Huawei devices in general, or does anyone know what devices support netconf and how to configure it?
 ​
 Thanks for any help, i'm really clueless at this point :-(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, I have a bit of a situation, I have been upgrading Fortinet firewalls in HA for over a decade and last night was the first time I had a fail, The slave firewall upgraded but the Master did not, at present I have Master on 7.2.2 and slave on 7.2.4 (Note that the slave is now the master).
 My thinking is to remove the heart beat(HA) cables and then connect directly to the original master (on 7.2.2) and upgrade it to 7.2.4 thereafter start the boot sequence and get the firewalls back in order with HA cables. I have made no changes since last night.
 Call logged with Fortinet but they are taking forever to respond. Anyone run into a similar issue and can offer some advice?

 I've noticed as I've both gotten older and have been in this field of ours for damn near 25 years, absorbing new knowledge and learning new systems/skills that I haven't worked with before is becoming more and more difficult. I struggle maintaining enough of a focus to keep at it, and also notice that my retention is pretty abysmal. Case in point, these days I'm trying to shove a lot of MS' Power Platform-skills into my head, since I'll be working a lot on that due to a move to Dynamics 36 that we're currently underway on.
 But I find it damn hard to actually do, even though I'm interested in what the Power Platform can do in terms of data management and automation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Kind of odd question but I hope someone can help me understand it.. as far as I know, IGEL reworked their license model recently and I'm not sure if it still works for our planned enviroment.
 We have around 10-15 Thin Clients, mostly in warehouses where it's rather dirty and since we swapped out most office PCs in 2021, I have a bunchload of old systems that I want to rework into TCs to replace our current "infrastructure" which consists mostly of 7-10 year old actual thin clients with a self-"constructed" Linux version. Latter one wasn't documented at all by it's creator who hase left us in the meantime.
 So around the middle of 2022 I got 4 IGEL licenses to test and that worked pretty fine so far, we decided for the UDP / USB-Version and had no problems occur and the remote assistence etc. helped a lot. I had to put the topic aside for a while now due to other more urgend topics and since we lack staff right now. 
 I read somewhere that IGEL reworked their license modell and it's no longer "Buy once, get 1 year of support and that's it. More support costs but you can use the thin client without support". Considering the rather dirty enviroment and that our current "Solution" produces no monthly/yearly cost (except a device fails after years of usage) I doubt that I'll get the OK for a yearly subscription model.
 So could someone break down the new system or if I understood it wrong and my planned system/setup would still work?

 We recently got an AV alert from the PCs AV solution, because it found an infected Autorun.inf on the stick. I've re-formatted the stick, but the issue reoccured soon after, which implies that the CNC machine is infected.
 We'd like to scan the CNC machine, but so far haven't found a virus scanner which fits our needs:

Does anyone know a fitting software?

 ​
 I'm writing to you because I can't figure out this odd behavior:
 We changed the IIS server's timeout setting from 90 seconds to 250 seconds.
 The appliance is placed on the back of an Azure LB with a 240-second timeout.
 Since the change, we have observed numerous transation timeouts where none had previously been reported.
 When the previous settings have been restored, everything was back to normal.
 Do you know why this peculiar behavior is occurring?

By default (i.e no SIEMs, no IDS, no firewall), how much info does a windows server log about any devices that connect to it? More specifically, is it possible for me to find which devices connected to it within a certain hour last week?
 Specifically the machine in question is a mail server running mdaemon. Someone sent an email from the organization's account with stolen credentials. We are trying to find the IP (and any other info if possible) for whoever connected to it. If windows server logs the IPs of all incoming requests, then it should be trivial to cross reference those requests with timestamp on the email right?

 Consider a L3 leaf switch with 2 trunk ports. They serve different tenants I want to keep isolated. Eth1 connects to a baremetal server owned by A, Eth2 connects to a bare metal server owned by tenant B.
 Furthermore, each tenant wants to create their own self-service isolated networks for their VMs/Docker containers. Or they could just go and configure a vanilla Linux VLAN interface on their box to send their own VLAN tagged traffic on an arbitrary subnet. I don't want to restrict this...
 Now normally I'd say A gets X vlans, B gets Y vlans, these are your subnets. But there aren't enough VLANs to go by, also, I don't want to restrict it to one server... I want the same L2 domain no matter which rack or switch the server…]]></summary>

 PowerChute gives us the notification that the UPS connection is not established via our Monitoring. We have tried everything so far. Reinstalling the Software, Replugging the UPS (which sometimes works), Rebooting the OS and so on. Nothing really helps.
 ​
 I know the UPS is connected to the server. If I uninstall the APC UPS Driver, then the UPS gets detected by Windows and the battery symbol appears in the taskbar.
 ​
 Doesnt matter what Windows Server it is. The problem happens on any of our Servers. Randomly I would say. Its really frustrating because you cant seem to fix it remotely.I dont wanna go on site to check the UPSes myself. Not with 100 clients.

 Anyone else having that issue? Or maybe someone has found a fix?

 I see that I am spending a lot of my free time in customizing things. Shell variables, aliases, bash functions, writing scripts to help me login to different envs (Azure, AWS, local Servers etc) easily. Aliases to execute frequent long commands. Functions to execute commands with parameters.
 Wanted to understand, that since this is the beginning for me to customize my env for myself, is it Okay to spend a considerable amount of time in the process? I am hoping that my current way of customizing will help me in future companies also, where I can clone this repo, switch to an old companies branch, take what should be taken from common (probably all), and then create a new branch with the new company name and add that company specific stuff there.
 Will doing things this way, which would make things heavily customized in the future, and might need some maintainence overhead too, is a good idea? Or is there a better way?

Problem is we don't see the tunnel (policy based) come up. My next steps were to do an embedded pcap as I am not seeing any traffic from the host at the firewall. I send an email to the vendor saying I see no traffic each time we test... but then after I explicitly point at the host in one of my emails we see an icmp request come across the fw about an hour later. Following I get an email from their pm asking me to explain steps I see in the network and they are requesting an additional resource to look at our network. 
 Now the question. And don't get me wrong, this is indeed ego related, but my ego isnt that big (is it?). 
 Previously when setting up the site to site, I worked with a respectable sounding network engineer. Would it be wrong to reach out to him and ask him what the hell? (Respectfully.) The problem is that the traffic never leaves the host. We have routes out and they proved it via ping. 
 TLDR: I want to hear about times that you all took back alleys to get things accomplished. Or do we all just play the follow along and provide pcap when requested?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advise how to join Cisco AP into existing mobility express. I need to join in mesh mode. To avoid Ethernet cables. All of them are powered by PoE adapter next to them. ME is running on 2x AIR-AP3802I-E-K9 where One is controller and second is wired access point(this will be ROOT for other wireless) AP that i need to deploy as wireless points of network are: 3x AIR-CAP3702E-E-K9. & 3x AIR-AP2802I-E-K9. Also if possible to deploy AIR-CAP1702I-E-K9 v02 (these old devices am not sure if can be used here) 
 So 1x controller ME 3802i + 2x RAP mesh ap 3802i +2802i +5 x MAP mesh from others( these can be upgraded to 5 more)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to figure out the best method to test and troubleshoot this issue I'm seeing. Every day around the same time, one of our sites' (public high school) bandwidth drops to nothing for about 15 minutes. I ran iperf tests on repeat and logged the output across the WAN to the site and I was getting around 1.8Gbits/s on a 2Gbits/s connection. Right around the time the students leave the bandwidth tanked in iperf (just across the WAN to the DC) and on speedtest.net to 30Mbits/s for between 5 and 15 minutes. Seems to happen each day around that time and then just clears up.
 I have smokeping running and that looks clean and never shows a change. I don't drop regular ping packets but if I run a faster fping I do see between 1%-4% packet loss around that time. Interfaces on my router are clear. Nothing in the logs of the routers on either side. Something tells me it's the WAN provider but I am out of ideas on what to test or how to prove the issue further. I plan on reaching out to them tomorrow to see if they can seen anything on their side but I know that will be tough to get them to research it. Any recommendations on what else to try and test?
 TIA!

 Career wisdom for sysadmins, compliments of HouseCravenRaw: 
  
Irreplaceable is unpromotable
 Documentation is king
 Know your exits (rollback plan, etc.)
 Always get a CYA
 Toot your own horn—modesty doesn't make money
 ‘No’ is a complete sentence
 Stability is paramount—don't aim for newest or best, aim for reliable and dependable
 Cattle, not pets
 Make sure your cattle are self-minding—the less fiddling and doting and button-pressing you need to do, the better
 Make your own roadmap, be it your career or your department, have a direction and test it
 When you do a thing, understand why you are doing it. Google might give you an answer, but it doesn't give you comprehension. Running a StackOverflow solution without understanding what's going on will only lead to more problems in the future
 Don't stay in one place too long
 Test your parachute, be it a tape backup or a rollback plan or a snapshot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm in the process of replacing the firewalls at our main site as well as our DR site and had a question as to what the best way to setup SSL VPN connections for our users would be. The current setup is non-existent in that my predecessor never did any SSL VPN config on the DR firewall (I don't know how they thought that was going to work in a disaster).
 Each site is going to have a pair of Palo Alto 3410s in active/passive HA. I'd like to try to avoid having to setup each user with 2 different SSL VPN configs (one for normal use and one for DR use) and the only way of doing this that comes to mind immediately would be for me to have a virtual firewall in the cloud that I use to terminate all of the client SSL VPN connections to and then have a site to site VPN between that firewall and both the production site and the DR site. With that setup, in a DR scenario I wouldn't have to touch the SSL VPN config, just route the traffic from the virtual firewall to the DR site rather than the main site. Obviously this would require extra licensing for the virtual firewall and increases complexity but I'm thinking it might be worth it to not have to setup every user with multiple SSL VPN configs and explain to them to use the DR one in a DR scenario.
 I don't have much experience with SSL VPN configs on Palo Alto firewalls yet, so if there is an easier or more efficient way to achieve this please feel free to suggest. Thanks.

 Before I was hired they were basically just winging it for managing their MS365 environment and giving anybody that needed any level of admin full blown global admin privileges. Now that I have started that isn't going to fly and I am going through and taking away privileges. The issue is I have multiple people claiming they need admin permissions but judging by how things were done before I got here I am very hesitant to let anyone keep their privileges. I am leaning towards just taking the access away and see how long it takes for them to even notice but I would also like to have some data as to why I made that decision other than telling the CFO I don't trust him to have admin privileges.
 Is there a report I can run showing the login history for the admin portals specifically? IE - I took your privileges away because you haven't even logged into the admin portal since 2021.

Here is the story and I'm hoping you fine folks can point me in the right direction. Have put our Firewall on the FY 23' replacement radar so I've seen demo's from a few vendors on their product, all vendors had our requirements beforehand on what I am looking for in a FW. We are not married to the big 'C' so I have ventured out to the competition and for the most part I have liked Fortinet and Checkpoint. I have invited all engineers in my department who have worked with our current FW and may administer the next solution (disappointingly they rarely showed up to the the Demo's). So now that I have spoken with the vendors of interest whats next? Do I make a decision based on what I've seen? Do I gather the team and ask, "Okay who should be continue to speak with in the next phase". We can't take demo's because I work for a Govt agency and its a against company policy, but I want to make the best decision possible that will benefit the organization. Can someone help me understand where I go from here?

 I have a grown /24 network I have to manage at our company because our networking colleague left the company...
 All adresses are used and therefore some colleagues get no ip address at all - as expected. 
 Now I don't really know how to professionally create a solution. First approach was to create a new /22 network but I read something about problems due to the Broadcast overhead with this many clients in a Single subnet.
 Currently I consider a multi-subnet network for our lan and wifi. But I simply don't know how to design this to avoid any problems in the future. 
 LAN ports can be assigned to the subnet, maybe one /24 per floor.
 My question is: How do I setup our wifi in the building? We currently have one SSID and I would like to keep this. How do I split this up? Same SSID with different subnets?
 Thank you for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This advice that I'm sharing is regardless of your level of seniority or experience in the IT field, and not specific to Sys Admins, as there are plenty of other IT roles.
 There are a lot of jobs out there, many listings, and with the advent of remote/WFH the markets you can work in have substantially increased. This naturally results in an increased number of job opportunities for each of us to apply to or be considered for.
 So my advice, waste less of your time, less time of the recruiter, and get actually useful information up-front.
 If you're a recruiter reading this, if you want to waste less of my time, give me these two things up-front. If you are an IT person (Sys Admin or otherwise) then it is in your best interest to require these two pieces of information FIRST, and yes even …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I manage a team of 10 (me+9). This morning one of my team texted me saying that they needed to take a mental health day. I texted back that those days are important, I didn't want them to burn out, and I'd see them tomorrow. I hope they have a relaxing day playing video games or gardening or whatever they do to destress.
 Later in the day another guy was more or less reduced to tears after an encounter with an end-user. An hour later they were still visible shaken. I told him to take the rest of the day off, fully paid. Then I went and had a talk with the end-user and told them that their department and IT should be on the same team. I can't have my people effectively helping him if he views us as the enemy and my team is scared to go help.
 Will we maybe have a larger load for the 8 of us left here today? Probably. Is it worth it so my people aren't burnt out and leaving and we have to hire new people? Yes, 100x over.
 If you're in a burnout situation, don't let your company/MSP gaslight you into believing that all IT jobs are like that or that all managers/directors are like that. Pay for a resume refresh, apply for other jobs, find a place where you're respected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're deploying Opengears around the US and global for OOB. This will be major cities primarily but you never know (one of our datacenters is in the boonies of NJ, for example).
 I think the answer here is a global-roaming multi-carrier SIM. One vendor, all networks, don't have to pay attention to where we ship it. Ideally it lets us also choose whatever carrier has best signal instead of being locked to the carrier we bought the sim from.
 I was looking at Twiliio, and the platform is just super cool, but we're not large enough for them to be interested in giving us a better rate. So I'm looking around for other choices. If twilio is the only choice then I'll hold my nose and pay, but it's worth asking what else there is. 
 Let's figure a burn of around 15MB/day so around 500MB/unit/mo. Not huge, not zero. Bogey being here occasionally we may want to use it for backup IP for the site, in which case we'll be burning 10s of GBs. But maybe that's ok in the case since it will be an emergency. (We normally run dual ISPs for offices but not everywhere has decent alternatives etc.)
 No, I don't expect it to be free, I just also don't want to get bent over, so to speak.
 Who else plays in this space that is worth talking to?

Every day the majority of my list is "following up with $vendor", I am just so tired of vendors doing half of the job and then ghosting us, or a service ticket with a vendor that has been active for months that has no sign of ever being resolved. At this point I have more issues and projects that I just accept as broken or un finished, its like they specialize in wearing you down until you just give in and give up. I never thought that most of my day would be spent this way.

 Apostrophes are NOT for plurals - the plural of computer is computers, NOT computer's.
 Apostrophes are for possession (That's Joe's computer), or for contractions ("Joe's using the computer" instead of "Joe is using the computer").

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have 2 SonicWALLs one in the US and one in Asia with a site to site VPN to each other for a call center. 
 The call center voice router and server is behind the US sonicwall. 
 Users in Asia also have a per user L2TP VPN for wfh days.
 Here’s the issue: When Asia users are at the office (hence using the site to site VPN in Asia) they experience call drops and crazy packet loss on the calls.
 We know this because the voice router/server monitors the calls.
 When Asia users are at the office and turn on their L2TP VPN to call, the calls are perfect with less than 10% packet loss. 
 Why would users experience better call quality using an L2TP vpn behind the sonicwall rather than just the site to site? It’s also all the same equipment too (wfh vs office)
 I’ve tried MTR and trace routes but since I can’t see the route behind the VPN i haven’t been able to pin point the issue.

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

 Me or my boss? Well, that's easy, neither. You don't get to email anyone here any more.
 The email has been reported as spam. The email/domain have been blocked company wide. The phone number has been blocked in the pbx.
 Numerous Phone calls/voicemails from (xxx) xxx-xxxx "Hi, this is Nancy Adams, I need you to call me back when you get a chance. Thanks." Who the fuck is Nancy? Oh a random software company rep, oh...
 Blocked on PBX. Looked up company/domain/email, blocked on email, web filter. Left a solid yelp review indicating business marketing practices. I don't think this is vindictive, not any more than calling someone leaving them a message saying "Call me back!"
 Every stupid fucking idea is brought to you by a recent bs-chool graduate who feels they need to "apply" their newly learned knowledge of bullshit.
 Do I sound upset? I'm a little upset. I'm done with this level of bullshit. This is a good place to vent.
 Edit: Why am I jumbling the case of the letters? It's to indicate their level of L33tness.
 ​
 Edit2: I should add this comes on the heels of me actually calling one of the vendors back and saying we were not interested in their service at this time and in turn what they did is add me to a list and I received 12 phone calls from their competitors in 5 days. So I am NO LONGER calling anyone back. That is what I get for being a decent person.

All they need is a file server so we decided to switch them to a structured p2p network. Our "server" is 32 GB Ram, 2 1TB hard drives that mirror every night. Everything looks great, except they have 2 VDI thin clients machines. Is there any way to get them to work in a P2P network? They didn't give me information on them whenever we discussed the job; I'll be honest, VDI is not in my wheelhouse. Any tips would be GREATLY appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 We are trying to migrate our on prem Exchange 2016 server to 365, but appear to have hit a roadblock from initial assessment while working with our MSP and I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this issue?
 We have an on prem Exchange 2016, with Business Standard licenses in 365.
 For the last 2-3 years we have been creating user in AD, with sync to 365 and giving them a Business Standard license, which includes a Teams License, and Mailbox.
 The Mailbox doesn't get used in 365, but still gets added as part of enabling the license. We just route all our mail to the on prem instance and connect Outlook to local exchange.
 The Teams license however does get used for scheduling video calls, and also creating the odd group and channels.
 My understanding is that to do a hybrid migration (and enable it), you can't have existing mailboxes in the cloud and those mailboxes need to be deleted.
 I also understand that Teams stores all the chat data in the mailbox as well. 
 So do we need to purge all our existing Team Groups in 365, and chat data as well as - then enable hybrid migration - and re-create them to do our migration successfully? 
 We also use SharePoint, but I don't believe that will cause any problems to the exchange migration as far as I know.
 Thanks for your help/input.

I don't understand this move. People are mobile, work from home, have cell phones and all of these things use DHCP. How is anyone narrowing down whitelists?
 Where have the blacklist options gone? Why are we perpetually guessing what shifted today with these products?
 Most importantly, why are people scrambling to find and locate such basic things as inbound blocking/allowing? It's because we now need a Microsoft Defender license for this "Feature," which I feel is far too basic to be locked behind monetary incentive, and was never a paid for feature before this year.
 Its incredible how many times I have had to pull back the customer's expectations for what is possible and not, when even the lay person can use words like "block" but I can't without talking about cost.

 An organization I am working for is looking to move away from their aging on-prem based sFTP server to a cloud based sharing platform with traditional sFTP support as well as a web based portal for easier customer access. 
 There are lots of file sharing / collaboration offerings out there but finding one with that is more or less a hosted service offering traditional sFTP client support along with web portal based access is proving difficult. 
 We have looked into Files / Egnyte. 
 Are there others that anyone can recommend that are similar to Files? Looking for a service that can scale starting small, maybe 60-70 customers and grow to 200+ with a predictable pricing model. Data usage is not a concern and will fall well below the capacity offerings of most of these services. 
 Anyways, open to suggestions as this seems a bit niche. 
 Thanks

 Perhaps there's a section in Intune/MEM that does all this, but I can't seem to find it.

 Maybe I'm reading in to this far too much, but I've noticed a lot of resellers seem to get irate at the idea that I have multiple people quoting for the same thing. Even more so when I receive a lower quote from someone else.
 I was wondering if maybe I am doing something wrong here? I've never thought much about it. Don't see what's wrong about trying to get the cheapest deal I can? But for example, we are currently quoting for a new chunk of hardware, we our usual supplier but also have 2 other companies this time who have both offered it cheaper. We've let our usual supplier know and they seem to be offended that we didn't just blindly go with them? 
 Is it rude of me to give out their quotes for other people to try and match/best? I can't imagine this sort of thing happening outside of IT but maybe I'm wrong.

 Im essentially trying to configure a Syslog-Server with a Webinterface running on an Apache2 Webserver.
 I messed around a bit on my Raspberry PI4, and am now trying to replicate this on a VM at work. However im already failing at accessing the default page of the webserver.
 On my Raspberry PI and at home, all i had to do was install the server, and allow communication through my UFW. After that, i could reach the Default Page via my Raspberrys IP-Adress in my Browser. I assume it tried reaching the server on Port 80 by default.
 This however doesnt work on my VM. Firewall is active, the webserver can accept packages on port 80 and 443. However i cant even ping the VM from inside my network.
 Any ideas?

 I'd like to set up a centralized file storage for these projects. I'd like it to be easy to access, easy to admin and easy to back up. We have Microsoft 365 basic (and standard for some users). I'd prefer a cloud based solution because I don't trust our network and I'm not touching that yet because I already own plenty of our infrastructure...
 Users are somewhat tech savvy but I'd prefer to have something that's easy to set up and organize.
 Any suggestions are welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got complaints from two different customers regarding lags in Microsoft Teams meetings, when multiple users on the network join the meeting individually.
 As far as I understand this, Teams is working like this:
 - Call between two people on the same network: Media traffic goes P2P
 - Call between two people not on the same network: All the media traffic goes through Microsoft servers
 - Call between multiple persons inside and outside the network: All the media traffic goes through Microsoft servers
 The last scenario is where they experience the problems – especially, when the number of internal people in the meeting is high, as every Teams client seems to up- and download all the media traffic.
 Have you experienced the same? Is there anything you can do about it? How do really large companies handle it, when they have like hundreds of people joining a Teams meeting for trainings of stuff like that?

 I'm currently in the process of finding a digital signage solution for our business. Specifically, I'm looking for a solution that can display both websites and PowerPoint presentations and is remotely manageable.
 I'd like to setup 2 bigger touchscreens in the lobby. Visitors should be able to use the touchscreen to navigate through our website as well as display promotional materials such as PowerPoint slides. The player should have WiFi because cabling is a bit difficult.
 Does anyone have experience with a digital signage solution that fits these criteria? Any recommendations or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 I have looked into Yodeck, Xibo and Posterbooking and Samsungs MagicInfo CMS solution. Tending to use Posterbooking + some smart touchscreen TV with a Fire Stick because this seems simple enough and up to 10 screens are free.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, I work for an organisation with around 400 users, when it comes to Adobe most just use Adobe Reader but we currently have around 60 users licensed for Acrobat Pro and about 20 licensed for Creative Cloud. IT management want to recharge the cost of these licenses to departmental/team cost codes, but we're really struggling with how to keep track of which licenses belong to which team. When a new license is purchased it just goes into one big pool in our Adobe Admin Console, we can allocate it to a new user but there's nothing identifiable about the license itself so no real way to track it as an asset or tag it as owned by a particular team. What would be ideal is a system where we can create groups for different teams and then allocate licenses to each group, I'm just wondering if there's any tool or method that makes this easily possible? Currently all I think to do is have a process of meticulous record keeping in an Excel workbook where we track how many licenses are purchased under each cost code and who is using each license, but this obviously isn't ideal. We need to ensure that licenses are kept within the teams that are paying for them rather than moving around the organisation as people join and leave.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 ​
 I don't know why, but it's easy for me to understand the core concepts of MPLS than MTU...
 Yes, by "MTU" I still mean Maximum Transmission Unit. I have read all these blogs, watched all these videos explaining MTU and its problems, but still here I am and ask for your help. 
 Let's say we have some simple topology: 
 Switch-A - Router - Switch-B 
 Switches are just L2 switches, all routing happens on the router (which is actually L3 switch). Assume that all switches have 48 access ports and support Jumbo frames. Some servers and clients are connected to these access switches in a random way. 
 Okay, now I want to enable Jumbo frames on my network because some (only some!) servers require this. I did it on all ports between network equipment, so there is no MTU mismatch on the network core. Now, let's say I enabled Jumbo frames support on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports. So we have:
  
Jumbo frames are enabled on all links between network devices.
 Jumbo frames are enabled on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports.
 All other access ports and devices connected to these ports have default MTU.
 
 My questions are:
  
What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to a server with 9000+ MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?
 What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?
 What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to the server with 9000+ MTU if: Client and Server are in the different subnets?
 What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the different subnets?
  
Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genuinely asking as I see a lot of people post in this subreddit about the negatives of working at an MSP. No surprise here, I currently work at an MSP. And while it is absolutely crazy sometimes, I also find myself listening to our customers talk about their jobs and they all seem extremely stressed as well. What I personally like about the MSP life is that it offers diversity:
  
Diversity of equipment. Every customer brings a different set of “happy little accidents” to the table and I find that challenge interesting even if I’m not personally the one helping to architect new solutions.
 
Diversity of focus. If you want to be pigeon-holed or expertise in a specific area, you can. But there are also tons of opportunities for crossover experiences in other areas.
 
Diversity of customer. Yes you get difficult customers. But you also get some pretty great ones to work alongside. I feel like this is a big benefit and helps to balance the crazy sometimes.
 
Diversity of ideas. In some ways you’re playing with house money. You can help the customer come up with solutions without having to worry about the dollars and cents. After all, that’s on them to figure out at the end of the day. Obviously you have to be reasonable and help work toward something that benefits everyone involved. But again, that’s a challenge that can be fulfilling.
 
 Those are just a few. And sure, you could read those with the same lenses of a non-MSP job. But isn’t that the point? Why is it such a negative too work at an MSP? Interested to hear from others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 We have a few networks that are through vWire. We recently experienced an issue with one of these networks where some the clients (static IPs) could no longer reach their gateway/Internet.
 Meanwhile, a different client on the same network was operating just fine and reaching its gateway/Internet.
 On our Nexus, we disabled the interface that was leading to the passive PAN. The issue was instantly resolved. We re-enabled the interface, experienced no issues for a few days only for the issue to return. LLDP is enabled in PAN for vWire if that helps.
 Any suggestions? I'd appreciate it, thanks!
 C9300, Stacked (between internal PAN and WAN PAN): interface TenGigabitEthernet1/1/6 description PA5430-1 vWire eth1/11 ae3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 switchport mode trunk interface TenGigabitEthernet2/1/6 description PA5430-2 vWire eth1/11 ae3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 switchport mode trunk Nexus 9K: interface Ethernet1/12 description PA5430-1 vWire eth1/12 ae4 switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 speed 10000 no shutdown interface Ethernet1/12 description PA5430-2 vWire eth1/12 ae4 switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 speed 10000 
 Edit:
 We're currently using Aggregate Ethernet for vWire in PAN.
 vWire when using Aggregate Ethernet does not support LACP, just LLDP.
 We're thinking of just removing AE to standalone links with LACP. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I hope somebody can shed some light on a problem that I am observing. I have the above Nexus layer 3 switch with a 1G ethernet transceiver and a CATx cable around 20m length plugged to an HP laptop also with an onboard ethernet port, auto-speed/duplex at both ends. The problem is that despite both ends being logically active, the link reports as not connected, when both ends are then physically connected. Bring down and bring back up the port on the Laptop (Windows Networking disable/enable) everything springs into life. Same symptoms observed plugging into another network device, although in that case, no option exists to manually down/up the interface (cheap IP cam) Plug the same devices and the cable into another switch, different brand but same logical configuration - it all comes up first time. So to me it's not the cable, and points to something on the Nexus. Nexus port config however is a really simple one;
 Interface eth1/27 switchport switchport access vlan 3 no shutdown 
 Has anybody seen this before, or could offer some clues on further diagnostic actions please?
 Ps already tried to post this in r/cisconetworking but apparently one has to be a trusted member..

I'm talking if you wanted to buy a Whitebox switching solution right now. It seems like there has to be more options than this. I'll make the analogy of when IP devices exploded and your spreadsheet was no longer an option. 
 If you wanted something rock solid to manager your IPs you bought either Infoblox or Bluecat. If your environment was not too large you could get away with Solar Winds which at the time was more of a spreadsheet on steroids.
 Does any such Whitebox solution exist if I were to get some Edgecore switches?

 I'd like to allow client-to-client connectivity, but only when the clients authenticated with the same credentials. For example, if UserA has a TV & laptop both authenticated as "UserA", I'd like UserA to be able to Chromecast from their laptop to TV. UserB would be able to ssh from UserB's laptop to desktop, but not send anything to UserA's devices. It seems like it would be a common requirement? 
 There are thousands of separate users, so manual per-user ACLs on the WLC are probably not going to work.

 I have a manager who knows nothing about IT and never remembers anything we teach them. 
 For the first time today, I had to step out while I had a breakdown because I couldn't take this. Shit is in flames every other day, but we can't even improve our infrastructure because we don't have time to do anything outside of playong catch up with patching.
 Nobody has specified tasks or jobs, and nobody is being held accountable for their mistakes. How the hell do you guys do this, because I'm already second-guessing my choice of taking this path. I didn't sign up for a job where I do tickets, patch EUDs, troubleshoot server issues, and am being screamed at in my ear to hurry to Win11.

 So, I wanted your input! What is your go-to method of detecting IP conflicts before problems arise? I'm sure I could script something up to scrape our ARP table on the edge-device and look for duplicates but hoping for something more graceful.

 Currently we have an ISIS Adjacency between a CPE (Juniper) and 2 PEs (CISCO IOS XR) , however the link between the CPE and the Primary CPE (Primary Link) is suffering packet loss.
 Since the hello timer is big enough , ISIS does not detect a failure and hence packets are sent through that faulty link and many packets are lost.
 If we configured BFD with the ISIS , the ISIS adjacency will be flapping between the 2 links / PEs , which is something that we dont want to have.
 Is there anyway to solve this problem , for example to keep the ISIS cost on that link high , untill the link is guranteed to be stable and with no packet loss then it use that primary link ?
 I am open also for any other ideas.
 Thank You.

Did a firmware upgrade on the switches and their L3 routing went down. After reboots they were able to get it back up. They require a strategy to prevent this sort of disruption from occurring again. Any suggestions? Perhaps break it up into 2 stacks and have a controller switch connect them? Maybe install a backup core and run HSRP? Any help is appreciated, thanks

 I own a lil ISP and I recently got approved from APNIC. Right now Im on the process of peering with my UPLINK and receive a full internet routes. Will there be any way I can identify the received internet routes with their domain name? My goal is to do PBR where all non facebook and google routes go to a different uplink. Ill be using an asr 9001 or probably an ISR 4451 to receive the full route and be the PBR router.
 Ive been using ibgp segment routing evpn and Im very familiar with it, but in the case of eBGP and route policies, super noob.
 Hope anyone can help!

 Anyone have any luck lately landing a fully remote position? I've been fully remote for like five years and it feels like more and more orgs are viewing it as taboo, meanwhile it makes zero sense to me...especially for companies that don't have the space to have employees onsite. 
 Feels like companies are more concerned about making you waste your time and cut productivity in half just to justify some form of an office space and real estate expenses. 
 I've been looking for a new gig for about 5 months now because the startup I joined is entirely dysfunctional and I'm doing 38 different jobs for one salary and I legit can't handle it anymore, the market feels like it's entirely frozen over. Even the postings that are available online I don't get a single hit on. Or I get a recruiter who responds to me via direct message on LinkedIn and never follows up. 
 How is anyone capable of working in three different cloud platforms, an expert database engineer, an infrastructure engineer, front end, back end guru, oh and you need to know IBM tools from 35 years ago. 
 COBALT EXPERIENCE IS A HUGE PLUS!!!!

 i am basically done with my knowledge.
 We have an enviroment where all computers got moved from one domain to another.
 The procedure was:
 Remove computer from old domain
 Add computer to new domain
 Between the old and the new domain was never a trust setup and they don't share a name.
 But now it gets strange:
 All computers that were in the old domain apply a policy for user privleges with the old "Domain User" Group and the old GUID. (I compared the guids)
 The computers are not a member of that domain anymore and we dont figure out why they apply those old policies.
 The new Policy with the new "Domain Users"-Group wont be applied at those two offices but within the main office the policy gets applied (it was connected to the old domain controllers.)
 ​
 The profiles with the old domain still exist on the computer but are not active anymore.
 The old DC is still arround (data is needed) but we cut the connection and applied the policies again and it still applies the old group.
 In HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\GroupPolicy\History are no suspicies entries.
 ​
 I know its kinda confusing and i can try make a bit clearer.
 ​
 Thank you for your help!
 ​
 P.S: I am sorry for the confusing text, i try edit it, to be more clear!

 I've been trying out different remote softwares to use instead of teamviewer/anydesk. The purpose is to control different laptops in a congress centre and all I need is to be able to control the OS. 
 Now I've tried Splashtop and Screenconnect and Google Remote all to my frustration. What I like about Teamviewer and Anydesk is that I download 1 app that I can connect from and to. It seems the ones I tried all need a different host and client app(splashtop), need logging in from a browser (google, screenconnect), need to create a secured token per session (screenconnect), or shortkeys can't be used (google). I don't need any bells and whistles since I'm not offering remote support, I just need basic control of my own laptops. A steady connection to about 12 laptops from 3-4 laptops in a directors booth with the possibility of connecting through a code with a possibility to remember/save the connections that I made will do just fine. 
 Anyone got a suggestion for a well functioning, really basic and cheaper alternative to Teamviewer/Anydesk?
 Cheers!

The exact same scheduled job works perfectly fine on the Windows 08 server but when I run on on our Win 2019 server, 
 I kept getting this below error code 2147942401

 I spent hours and hours trying to troubleshoot but I am not getting anywhere. 
 So far I tried 
  
Added the account with sufficient privilege to "Log on as a batch job" in Local Security Policy
  specified the "Start In" folder path 
 using Powershell within the scheduled task to call the batch files 
  
None of the above work, those batch files work if I just double click on them. 
 Any help would be much appreciated :)

 Do you have any problems with it? What happens when i login one user on two servers? for example when i use a loadbalancer and one server crashes, so the loadbalancer switch the user to an other server.
 Do you have experiences with profile curruption?
 Currently i use romaing profiles.
 Do you guys have made other experiences - good or bad? Please let me know so i can be prepared.

I've even manually added external dns (like 8.8.8.8) and it still won't resolve. All other servers on this domain work fine. The only fix I've been able to get to work, but not permanently, is to remove the vnic from vsphere, and then add a new one, and configure it with the static ip and such.

But I do way more than just talking on the phone. Here's the deal. Eventually I would like to pivot out of IT. The reason is because I am more passionate about Science, Biology and Health. I would like to get my masters in Public health and my job won't pay for it if it's not job related. Plus I would like to work in those fields listed above. But it's gonna be hard going from tech support to say a business analyst, regulatory affairs, health policy or any type of non IT job. So I changed my resume title to business analyst. EVen though that's not my official job title. My manager has seen my resume and said it looks good. I'm not sure if he paid attention…]]></summary>

 I'm here in hopes you can give me an idea what might be the issue with the following problem:
 The customers has Exchange online with two shared mailboxes attached to their account, to counter the lag they experience when clicking on E-Mail, I've enabled the Exchange Cache. That does just fine for their main email but for the shared mailboxes this doesn't work at all, nothing is loaded it's just empty.
 If I disable it again, everything works great. Currently I'm running Exchange Offline with "Downloading Shared Mailboxes" disabled but that's obviously suboptimal as I want them to be cached too.
 - It's the latest Windows 10
 - Latest Version of Outlook 2019
 - Tried creating a new profile
 - Tried deleting the cache manually
 It's just like Shared Mailboxes is cursed for me. What am I doing wrong?

 I also noticed this "Note" on that Microsoft article:
  
Clearing the check box won’t remove WebView2 Runtime from devices on which it has already been installed. Only new installations of WebView2 Runtime are prevented.
 There is no policy setting (for Group Policy or Cloud Policy) to turn off the automatic installation of the WebView2 Runtime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are some funny encounters that I had while helping around with some IT work. Some of them could be avoided by provisioning better training, others maybe people just had a bad day.
 #1 I once got a call to see a computer asap that "definitely had a virus".
 On the same day, I got delivered there a new keyboard there.
 When entering the office I was welcomed by a guy showing me how each of the apps he would open would not work properly and in word... space button would be pressed continuously.
 As you could probably tell by now, the virus was on a shelf, where the old keyboard was stored, pressing the space button. 
 #2 After setting up an entry system with an intercom, I went home to get a very disappointing call just before entering my place. "The system is not working." After troubleshooting remotely, I had to be on my way to see what is happening. I get a phone call just before, saying that they just realised that someone pressed the break glass button to exit the building. The emergency button had a case around it and looked very different from the exit one which is touch-free.
 A couple of days later, when setting their cards, I could see that someone would answer the intercom and they would go to open the door manually. But this one is on me, I did not leave specific instructions on how to unlock it. 
 #3 Once got called in to help someone find the attach button from outlook. I've also had numerous cases of "it's not working", "is it plugged?", "nevermind, thank you".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m in the broadcast/events world and have had a request come through that has me a bit stumped as to what direction to take.
 A client of mine is looking after an event for a client in the finance sector who has previously had trouble sharing and controlling the digital assets generated for they’re annual conference. Think loads of powerpoint files and video content. Changes and updates are frequently made right up until the presenter walks onstage.
 The assets are generated by the end client’s own internal teams hence the usual solutions of ftp/dropbox/removable media that we would rely on are off the table due to the end client’s security policies.
 My first thought was some hosted storage appliance that we could replicate locally once we get onsite. That way the client’s IT can administer the appliance as they see fit and the local clone/cache will ensure speedy transfers once we get to the pointy end onsite at the event and need to ingest to the show machines. The event is well supported internally and the internal IT teams have been pretty good to work with on similar events in the past as long as we are reasonable in our requests and timescales.
 Any thoughts/reactions from those in the finance sector?

 I'm delegating control to IT support users so that they can join a PC to the local AD domain. I'm using the Delegate Control option on the parent OU.
 When the computer object does not exist, then everything's working ok.
 When the computer object already exists, I get an error when trying to join again to the domain. (in cases for a re-formatted computer, etc.)
 The permissions I gave to the IT support group are the following:
 You chose to delegate control of objects in the following Active Directory folder: domain.local/Parent The groups, users, or computers to which you have given control are: ACL-AD-DomainJoin (DOMAIN\ACL-AD-DomainJoin) They have the following permissions:

 Create All Child Objects 
 Delete All Child Objects 
 Change password 
 Reset password 
 Read and write account restrictions 
 Read and write personal information 
 Validated write to DNS host name 
 Validated write to service principal name 
 Read and write DNS host name attributes
  
​
 For the following object types: Computer 
 If I delete the computer object manually, then the join-domain task is ok.
 The thing is that I don't want to manually delete each object every time, I want this to happen automatically.
 Do you have any ideas about what I'm missing here? I'm trying to accomplish this using the least privilege in mind. Any help is appreciated.

I've been running my own mailservers (I know, it's a challenge) for about 25 years now, fairly successfully (my server's mail gets accepted by the big players, which was a tough task to accomplish over the years, but I finally got Microsoft to clear my IP-addresses, even though they assumed they were part of an entirely bad reputable block of addresses). OK, so here I am, strange how even I question the use of _dmarc every now and then. As a result of weird behavior while migrating from server 1 to server 2 I had to change _dmarc policy to none.
 SPF is correct, DKIM passes for all, but I just want to be certain;
 All mail account users and mail-domains reside behind one hostname and one IPv4 and one IPv6 address. They all send and receive mail using those, SMTP is on that one address. Am I still correct in assuming that setting policy to "reject" should be fine then?
 No other servers should try and send mail using any of our system's domain names. If they do, mail should be rejected. None of my users try to use gmail or others to use our email-addresses as aliases, so that problem is non existent. And websites using these domainnames, that may have mail-forms are all using our smtp as well. Are there any exceptions to this that I'm missing?

 - Do you use Ethernet P2P (EPL) services and what for? 
 - What network statistics and reporting would help you run your networks?
 - How would you want such information presented (Portals? Reports? APIs?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, one of my users is constantly complaining about his laptop crashing when entering sleep mode/when he leaves it for a while. The problem is that my collegue has already tried installing all of the newest drivers and did basically all he could. He ended up resintalling Windows which helped for a while. When the issue appeared again, we decided to give the user a brand new device but it started happening again. We suspect it might be one of the Apps he installs without our knowledge. ERROR ID in logs is 6008.
 Does anyone of you know a work-related app that might cause this? Or anything else that might cause it. Thank you very much!

 I'd like you to know:
  
ADHD is misnamed. It's not really about Attention Deficit or Hyperactivity, that's just two of the first symptoms seen in children. It doesn't get renamed because it's in legislation (including the ADA). 
 
It's about Executive Function, and in Adults that shows up differently. It can be a hyperactive brain. It can be difficulty maintaining concentration. But it can also be difficult to stop concentrating on something that you find fascinating. Most adults can 'get by' if they've only a mild form of this disability. (I did for 30+ years). 
 
Not all children obviously have the 'stereotypical' ADHD, and they get missed.

I have reached a top of my salary range, at least for a while and looking for additional employment in this field. What would be your recommendations for someone who would like to find a part time job in networking? I do deploy cisco nexus, catalyst and probably most importantly ACI fabrics including day to day support and tshoot. How would you steer your career to get additional weekend/evening job? There is not many part time offers, and I would prefer to not get fully OVER EMPLOYED as it brings too much risk for me in case someone finds out and I'd lose my primary job. What alternatives would allow me to get more $$ working in the same field after hours (flexible hours) and where to find these jobs as in 99% places is seeking for full time? Location UK. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following on from my previous query here, I'm having more problems with Failover Clustering VM resources that I can't delete. u/BlackV please help me again :)
 I have a Hyper-V Failover Cluster managed by VMM where there are about 8 VMs that have "disappeared" from Hyper-V but at still listed in Failover Clustering. The Failover Clustering console shows them as "offline" and attempts to delete them fail with an error saying they are moving. The output of `Get-ClusterGroup` shows the group state as `Pending`. I don't routinely manage this cluster anymore, so I don't know the precise details of whatever happened over the weekend to trigger this odd state.
 The VMs still exist (the config is still on the disk) so I'm hoping I can remove the old VM registration in Failover Clustering, re-register the VM in place and add it back.
 Things I've tried:
  
Deleting the resource group in the Failover Clustering console - fails, information details says the request could not be accepted because the group is moving
 Deleting the child resource (i.e. the actual VM resource) in the Failover Clustering console - fails (sorry can't remember the precise error for that one)
 Using the `DestroyGroup(...)` WMI method on the resource group - hangs
 Using the `DeleteResource(...)` WMI method on the child resources - hangs, but the child resource is marked as deleted, clustering still shows it however
  
Once again, I'm after any suggestions on how to clean this up without taking down the entire cluster.

 If I understand correctly, Microsoft issued the original patch in June 2021, then re-issued the patch in June 2022, then again re-issued the patch in November 2022, and will again re-issue the patch in March 2023.
 I am trying to identify which version of the patch has been installed on a host today. Is the system running on the June 2021 version, the June 2022 version, or the November 2022 version - (and eventually, the March 2023 version).
 I have tried using WMIC and DISM queries, but these patches appear to be part of the cumulative monthly updates and aren't individually listed.
 Hoping there is a DLL file version that can be checked... or something I am missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have no idea if this is the right forum for this question, but a group that I work with has been asked to set up a WIFI mesh network for a number of semi-permanent camps. The idea is to provide free wifi to roughly 60-100 sites (read homes) that will be equipped with a low-cost router enabling several family members to connect to.
 There's been some back and forth on what equipment to use, but I was hoping that there was a best-practices standard that we could fall back on. Reliability, affordability, and ease of maintenance are the three top priorities (in that order) for this project. It will be really hard to service the APs and routers hooked up to the local fiber network that will be provided by a telco.
 The idea is to set up "smart" poles that will be used to mount the APs as well as all of the grounding equipment etc.
 Thanks again for any and all advice -- we will most likely need to contract this out but I wanted to check with this sub first just to get a general idea of min/max including projected costs.

 when we connected the core switch (1st floor) with the dell switch (2nd floor) both switch doesnt link up. but when we brought the core switch to the second floor and connected via LC-LC cable without the interfloor patch board, both switches linked up so were thinking the patch board is at fault here.
 heres a few pattern that we tried
 Juniper Core(1st Floor) [LR/LC]<--->[SMF/SC] patch board [SMF/SC]<--->[LR/LC] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) = No Link up
 Juniper Core(2nd Floor) [LR/LC]<--->[LR/LC] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) = Link up
 Juniper Core(1st Floor) [UTP Port]<--->[UTP Port] patch board [UTP Port]<--->[UTP Port] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) = Link up
 is there any other method we can connect the 10G thorough 2 floors? i dont know if the problem actually resides on the patch board aswell...worst case we might have to use a few UTP cable and create a LAG and maybe make it 2~4Gish

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My organization is looking to expand internationally, specifically with marketing. There are plans to hire international employees as full time so I've been looking into onboarding via Autopilot, including purchasing equipment via CSP with localized keyboards and everything. I've lots to figure out there but it seems to cover all our needs. 
 However, I've got to think about offboarding in the future as well. I'm not against allowing folks to keep their equipment assuming we're able to remotely wipe the device and the offboard is friendly. But for cases where the employee needs to surrender the device, I'd rather not ship equipment all over the planet. And even if we can get the equipment back, we won't really have a need for laptops with non-qwerty keyboards.
 For those in similar setups, what's your approach to dealing with decommissioned international devices that are used in ninch business cases like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm trying to determine the best systems to use and wanted to get your opinions. 
 Current environment:
  
Employees: 70
 IT: 1 member
 Mixed environment - Windows/Mac computers (80/20) + Linux VMs. 
 Computers are not managed/domain-joined. 
 
 The majority of the business workloads reside on AWS. 
 Small on-prem footprint - local server for internal application/file server 
 File server is used to temporarily store files generated locally before it is then uploaded to AWS for processing. 
 
 Google workspace is used for email, storage, etc. 
 Currently using Google SSO to authenticate to other SaaS applications. 
 
 Microsoft 365 is also in place with similar licensing as Google Workspace. 
 Primarily used for office suite/collaboration via SharePoint. 
 
  
Ideally, I would like to tie everything to a single IDP and need a device to serve local DHCP (multiple VLANs)/DNS for internal resources. 
 I was leaning toward a hybrid environment since there is already some on-prem infrastructure so I was planning to spin up an AD environment off the same hardware. 
 Alternatively, I was considering a cloud-only environment leveraging AzureAD/Intune but in this scenario, I would want to migrate everyone off GW to M365 to take advantage of the additional features offered like conditional access, etc.
 The last option I am considering is JumpCloud. It seems to meet my requirements as far as a centralized directory, IDP, policies, and support for MacOS/Linux. But I never used this platform before so uncertain how it performs. 
 Any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you.

 Has anyone else tried this successfully? Or am I chasing a dream that’s easier done with some physical hardware to supplement?

Now, I have nothing against Crowdstrike, its a great product, specially if you have Overwatch, however, it lacks on network protection and web filtering, and since this is a must have (in my opinion), the company needs to spend more money on a third party software (like dnsfilter for example).
 Since MS Defender for business is included in their license, I’m inclined to recommend them to make the switch from Crowdstrike to MS Defender for business. Then, with the money that is saved, buying dnsfilter (or other product) for an extra layer of protection , and invest more on security awareness training for the users and still save a lot of money!
 Would you do the same?
 P.S: I know Crowdstrike is a great product and security is not about saving money, but in this case I think we can actually improve their overall security by moving to defender.

This new one is setup with an IP in the same range as the old one, both have a private network with the exact same up range. The old one will discover my devices via snmp and I can ping each individual device from the web console of it. The new one will not discover the devices, I enter they discovery info the exact same way as the old one and get nothing. This one will not ping the devices. Running a traceroute on the old server, it shows that it connects directly to the device in question. No other hops. Running a traceroute to the same device on the new one shows that it is going out to out ISP and so forth. 
 What could I be missing to enable this new server to talk to all of my APC devices. 
 From what I can see on all of my switches there is no routes or anything point these devices to the old server. It’s gotta be a routing issue somewhere right or am I missing something?

 I was hoping my issue is that I have a cheap Amazon tester (I need to test a cable maybe once every three weeks). But the Klein's couldn't decide if it was good or not. I was set to buy the Klein Scout 3 before I asked a different tech where I work to verify the results with his tester. I pulled, bended, put on tension on the jack, and it would still pass.
 Can cables fit into a margin of error for testers? I know Klein tools have degraded in quality, have their testers done that as well (the passing Scout is younger than the one that failed it). Or why would testers not agree on this cable (5e, hand terminated on both ends)

 I am looking for a tool that I can install on my work Windows desktop to manage all the RDP connections that I make 
 Also, I hotdesk, so swap between different monitor sizes, types, and setups, including Ultrawide, so i want to standardise the resolution to open the same 1080p every time. 
 I really like the layout and GUI of Microsoft Store RDP app, but i can't use it at work, also it is missing some basic functionality and tools (Eg, file sharing) 
 What do you guys recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this particular day i leave early andour dept director mails me saying the dept central mail received a phishing email from one of the managers mails. (i dont know why these people aren't taking this seriously)
 i tried contacting the manager but to no use... no answer to my phone calls and i ask the dept director what the mail was about, and he forwards the mail and i did some research and i found out from an overview graph that the sketchy link with numbers and shit leads to 2 end points, 1 of them is one drive and another to an IP.
 after this i mailed all our staff giving them a warning of the phishing campaign and asked them not to click on any links blindly.
 my question to you my fellow admins is what can i do or what would you do to prevent any of this from happening again... because the industry were in, we don't want critical info leak and as the person in charge i think i should take responsibility even though no one is taking this serios and assess the situation and find a way to prevent it from happening again.
 what should i do? please help
 ​
 i was thinking of suggesting to run a GoPhish campaign, to give the staff a reality check by changing the passwords of the employees who fall it and then give a training on this.

Between shows, the iPads have to be refreshed - wiped of any client data, wallpaper potentially updated (for white-label service), reset settings, update iOS, etc. The app the startup provides on the iPad is distributed via TestFlight and that too has to be updated. I have researched a lot of potential solutions for management software, but haven’t found any of them that specifically mention devices that are leant or rented out (and potential issues around that type of usage that the management software accommodates). Also, looks like none of them can update a TestFlight app. Looking for an affordable solution with intuitive management dashboard/interface. What are some of the best mdm options for this scenario? Thanks!

 Is there any reason why I couldn't just use machine/computer authentication over Computer/User? Is there any downside of computer only?
 I get that someone could steal a domain laptop, but at the moment we're not checking for that. We want to get 8021x embedded and working first before branching out to maybe different vlans and auth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I’m really unsure if this is the correct place to ask, so if it isn’t, just let me know and I’ll move on :-)
 I have a project in mind that I’m unwilling to start until I get a second opinion. 
 Background: I have many USB devices each streaming sensor data at a very random, potentially very high rate. The current method of listening to these devices is to connect them all to a large hub and listen on whichever computer I’m using to record the data. Processing is done as data arrives, etc. This is manageable, but undesirable for a couple reasons:
  
Only one PC can listen at a time
 
To reduce bandwidth cost, the devices do not report human-readable data. Rather, the host is responsible for deserializing/parsing the data as it’s streamed though
 
 Solution: Have a single server computer dedicated to listening to the serial streams, parsing, then passing the stream to clients around the network in a more desirable format. Extending this, I suppose there could be multiple “sub” servers forwarding to a main server which distributes to whoever is listening, but I’m not going to bother with that at the moment. 
 My question(s) to you: 
  
Is this worth pursuing? At its core, all I’m doing is forwarding usb bits to the network and moving the parsing work to a different computer. At the moment, a single computer solution is working just fine, if annoying. 
 
Has anyone done anything like this? 
 
 Thank you!

There's no structure to anything, they use Workspace, 365, Dropbox, Slack, Zoom and probably more idk about yet. There's no SSO, all accounts siloed, many of them just consumer accounts created by the staff themselves. Devices are both Mac and Windows, no MDM, AV, domain join etc. all local accounts with admin. 
 They're looking to double staff count year on year so I need to get an IdP in place ASAP. For me this has always been AD, however I've never been somewhere this wasn't already in place. What would people here recommend as an IdP for a small company with 1 IT person to manage it?
 Should I just go with AD? (Hybrid) or look at newer stuff like Okta and similar?
 It's a R&D company that's entire existence relies on it's internal research data, that currently any employee can easily walk out the door with. I'm coming from the legal sector where security, compliance and audits were very high priority and I/We had built out several layers to achieve this. Coming into this place, while I realise now is probably normal, gets my heart rate up.
 ​
 Appreciate any assistance!

 Current Design:
 AT&T /30 --> AT&T Router --> CPE FW (with old /29 Inbound NATs) 
 Proposed Design:
 AT&T New /30 --> VeloCloud (with New /29 Inbound NATs) --> CPE FW
 (Note: Connection between VeloCloud and CPE FW will be transit network /30 and would request them to point all traffic/default route to the VeloCloud)

 I am in government sector IT and have a few areas in our jurisdictions which ISPs report meeting the FCC guidelines for broadband, however residents within those pockets complain of quality and speeds from that ISP. We're looking to challenge the FCC maps to allow other providers to come in with infrastructure grants to complete fiber to the home for all homes in our jurisdiction which we have minus these cable provider pockets which providers hold the territory and only provide the bare minimum speeds to lock other providers out. 
 Okay... now for what I'm looking for....
 I'm looking for a hardware device which we can have residents plug into their service providers modem which will collect results on ping, jitter, downtimes, and run periodic speed tests.
 I'm thinking a PI or or Nuc which can run some software to do this... the question is... which software will do all of this for us?
 It can be any operating system, ideally be able to push reports back to us for us to challenge locations and ISPs faster and less purchase on our end as we can move devices faster.

Normally I would buy a certificate from Comodo/Verisign or use Lets Encrypt for personal web sites, but other than using PKI services I am not too knowledgeable on how this works out side of a corp or business environment. < I would self sign the needed certs and install the root cert onto the device first > 
 How does one get a "valid client certificates" ? 
 Alternately, can one purchase a intermediate cert of some kind to sign your own as needed so that they are then "certificate issued by reputable certificate authorities " ? IE. you have 10's of devices.
 PG&E currently supports only SHA-2 X.509 certificates issued by reputable certificate authorities (PG&E does not accept self-signed certificates) Data requests and responses are made using the HTTPS protocol and are authenticated via a two-way certificate exchange with PG&E, requests between you and PG&E are over mutual SSL and require that you attach your client SSL certificate to your request.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! We are running a product documentation portal using WordPress (not the best solution I know, but development time was essential) and IIS 10 on Windows Server 2022. Access to this portal is delegated by us, so nobody can register on his own. If a user wants to access the documentation files (pdf, zip, etc.), he must log in to the portal.
 All files are currently in the data/ folder which is in the root folder of the app that is also exposed by IIS on the internet. The data/ folder is custom made and not part of WP by default. The issue with this situation is that everybody that knows the folder name and filename can directly access it as an anonymous user, which is a security risk (for instance, if our domain is example.com, you can navigate to example.com/data/sample.pdf and download the file without logging in).
 Is there a solution on how to set it up in the web.config or some setting in IIS that you can prevent that behavior? I'd like that only users logged into the WP portal can download the files.
 I thought about moving the data/ folder from the app root folder into a folder that is not directly exposed by IIS, but I believe that WordPress would have huge problems accessing that files.
 Edit: I believe IIS (and not WP) is allowing anonymous users to download the files in the data/ folder as it is exposed to the internet. The general idea I'm currently looking at is how to tell IIS which user is authenticated by WP and which is not? Maybe by looking at a Cookie or something?

Depending on what they select as their main issue it may prompt them with a secondary drop down list of more specific issues. For example, Main issue = "Email" then a more specific issue list would contain "Distribution list change".

 I was looking into using pfsense to create the captive portal and using freeRADIUS to handle the user database. I would like your suggestions on which tools would be best suited to accomplish these 2 goals. 
 Is it possible to do this without 802.1X access points since the current access points don't support that?

However after, I realized that none of the DNS records in the original forwarding lookup zone (FLZ) changed. They were still all under the old FLZ. I can only assume that migration of these records was not apart of the process of rendom (is that true?)
 If so I am trying to use a powershell script to migrate from one FLZ to the new FLZ. This worked, and I converted all the PTR records as well with powershell. 
 The question is, is this what I should be doing to migrate to the new FLZ after rendom?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been doing SNMP metrics collection for 20 years now with a modified MRTG setup that in addition to storing the data in native RRD files also sends the data to a TSDB which is then fronted by a heavily automated Grafana instance. Now that the world is very slowly moving away from SNMP and towards metrics via REST API and streaming telemetry (Cisco MDT for example) I am starting to research paid metrics collector suites like SolarWinds, PRTG, Zabbix, etc. So far I'm unimpressed with SolarWinds in that it is still using a classic SQL DB for metrics storage instead of a modern TSDB approach. I also don't like the fact that the data is more or less locked in SW - I need to be able to stream a copy of it as close to real time as possible for analysis in other platforms (think a TSDB with ML components). 
 Bonus points for netflow collector and analysis discussion too.

 I'm trying to find a good "Change Tracking" system, not management. As in, I don't need an approval process and advanced workflow system. This is for myself and one tech, all of the final changes are passed through me, but I am looking for something free, basic and cloud based if possible.
 Ideally it would have the ability to add devices or software applications, and tie a "Date", change made with notes/attachment to each item. With basic search capability, keyword, date, device, etc.
 I've looked at and demoed Jira Service Management, and the Atlassian products. While this looks like an amazing product for an enterprise wide management/control/service desk system, it is way too much for our needs.
 I'm not opposed to something self hosted with PHP/MySQL either, but am not looking for anything NIX based.
 The purpose of this is to be able to fall back on the info if something else is affected later on, or we run into the issue or similar issue again.

 What solution should I be looking for? FTP with scheduled transfers? If so, what client supports mirroring of the file structure as well as bandwidth control/scheduling?
 All servers are running WS2019/WS2022 and there are no DB's or VM's that are being copied. Client solution preferred over scripting.

 Leaving a comfy job that is on the downward due to age of owner for a company that is growing if I get it.
 I'm not nervous of my ability just of course will be nervous being questioned for things I can't anticipate in advance.
 I've found the company has no DMARC, DKIM setup so thinking of bringing this in for a quick win on a report.
 Any advice for a rusty old see dog trying to do better for himself and his family?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I made the switch to another company: less hours, better pay, shorter commute - all really nice things. But what I appreciate the most is how my new manager treats us: I had to do an upgrade for a business critical application (we talk multiple millions in revenue just from this application per week) after hours. It was scheduled to start at 5.45pm, but at 5.30 I got a call "we need till" 6pm. Ok, no problem. But you know how it turned out... At 7.30pm I finally could start to shut down the running services. Unfortunately the installation routine runs for up to 60 minutes, even if it fails. So of course this happened multiple times and after some digging around in the log files and doing multiple steps manually that should run automatically, I was finished at around 1.30 in the morning.
 I informed my manager the next day (back at work at 8am) and his response was "First: Next time just tell them you will not start after the agreed upon time. It's our job to make sure this stuff works, but we are not responsible if they can't finish their work in time. Second: if something like this happens again, feel free to call me for support. I am usually awake till 2am anyways so just give me a call! Third: Go home and sleep - if you work longer hours, just come in later so you can get enough rest".
 Feeling the support of the people above me and knowing they will stand up for me and help is worth much more than all the things that made me switch jobs in the first place. For the first time in the last two years I enjoy my work again.
 And yes, I did take him by his word the next time something didn't go right: at 10pm I called him. He tried to help me figure it out and at 11 told me "I don't know what's wrong. You can stop now, I will take over“.

I got a new Internet connection from ISP A and they installed the Wi-Fi router. I changed its name to 'WIFI A' and pw to 'PASS1'(router access). My family was out of the country, and I had manually connected only 2 devices of mine to that newly installed Wi-Fi. But when they came back all of their devices got connected automatically without the need of entering a password. This is something new for me. One important thing to mention, we have a home in another city and its wifi name and password are the same but the device and the ISP are different. Is it possible that the devices knows the Wi-Fi router through its name not their MAC? And when it scanned for a Wi-Fi it got authenticated?

 ​
 Basically we need able
  
to track all out product via serial number (or tag), find all related product
 add maintenance/change event to product
 find all product with certain attributes/value to send service bulletin to customers
 see product delivery date, warranty, options, change history of product
  
​
 Delivered product set could be like
 The broadest set of product
  
base machine
 crane
 harvester head
 measuring devices
 computer
  
Or single product
  
energy wood head
  
​
 I have looked asset managements software but al most every one is related to IT (Datacenter, racks, Networks, Computers, etc,). Is there general software where we can define product types/categories and dependable product and also customers?
 And yes, there is PDM but we looking more lightweight solution.
 Any hints where to look?

 I have an openvpn server set up on an Amazon Lightsail instance (London, UK) which to date, for the years I have been based in the UK, has worked flawlessly as my personal VPN, and has had a negligible impact on my download speeds.
 However, since recently moving to South East Asia, connecting through the same VPN is absolutely killing my internet speeds. This is a little surprising, as I understood that greater geographic distance from the server would increase 'ping' times, but actual download speeds should remain mostly unaffected?
 I am generally seeing speed test results that show connection speeds of ~40mb/s through public wifi networks being reduced to somewhere around ~4mb/s-- 10% of the actual underlying connection speed!
 I am looking at setting up another Lightsail instance in Singapore and cloning my OpenVPN files onto it. But I wonder if anyone can comment on why this is happening; is this at all as surprising to you guys as it was to me?

 I work for logistical company and I have noticed that one work process which the operators reapeat over 1000 times a day can be done much more effectively by using the full capabilities of already provided HW. I am sure I can improve the efficiency on this process by 10-20%. I have even tried configuring the HW in a proper way in test enviroment. It works, now I just need to implement it which is quite simple.
 Since the business will now have a great improvement in this process these operator positions will be much more profitable. Shouldn't I receive atleast some one time bonus for the extra effort I put in this?
 BTW: I won't make the process easier for the workers, if that was the case I wouldn't be asking the question and just implemented it. It just improves their efficiency.
 The though of receiveng a bonus can't leave my mind since monday and the moment I realised I can do 5 step task in 3 steps.

Per core licensing because fuck you, a Standard license (for the entire VM host) only allows two VMs, but a Datacenter license costs an arm and a leg. Even with non profit discounts, we end up paying $4400 to license three physical servers that can only run two VMs each (and the physical hardware is running ESXi), just to have the privilege of working with broken software. What's that? You want to separate out server roles, keep things more separate, without worrying about re-licensing the same hardware twenty times? Same environment, 25K. For Windows Server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we are going to remove our line interactive UPSes on the second supply side of our racks and provide them with straight utility power to save a little bit of power (I guess battery chargers are energy hogs or something). I tried to say this was as a bad idea and I was told that the generator will only take a few seconds to power up. My first thought was about power stability but apparently the electrical engineers have no problem providing 80 volts to 160 volts and that supply should just work fine. 
 My opinion is not even being considered so I'm just going to do it despite my objections. I feel like this is begging for problems.
 I think this is a horrible idea but I have been tasked to remove the redundant UPSes to save on maintenance costs because utility power is good enough!!
 So how does everyone feel about this assessment. Is it worth it to loose a layer of redundancy for a couple hundred dollars a month?
 Edit readability.

 But I want something more, something that lands me in the 90k+/ yr salary, but doesn't force me to put in 50+ hrs a week. I prefer life than work.
 The issue is, I'm the main breadwinner of a house of 4. Wife works but doesn't make 20k a year. 2 teens who literally feast like Kirby. So I'm always living paycheck to paycheck at 65k .
 Current job is help desk but we're so limited to do shit, it feels like a govt contractor t1. Can't create an ad account, many things go to admins that in any other job I did, I could do. 
 I'm thankful I have a job, but I also sense they want me gone as I haven't had benefits kick in post trial period. Haven't rocked that boat because I don't want to be unemployed no certs guy.
 Ps: before you ask why no certs, I've always worked 80+ hrs weeks doing IT and instacart type shit. 7 days a week just to make ends meet. Still do.

The owner of a company has asked for a dual monitor setup to companion with his 2019 16" MBP he has. Long and short he liked walking into one of our offices and seeing how we had 4 monitors up on a stand all to the same PC and wanted some of that screen real estate goodness.
 I am currently stuck though, maybe because not a single person on the team is an "Apple guy" or something, but I have yet to find a Mac dock that does dual independent display (no mirroring) but also supports both Intel and the newer M1/M2 MBPs. The best looking ones currently we could find we're from Anker in the 775 and the OWC docks but those required thunderbolt to DP or HDMI converters too for the 2k resolution screens (TB displays aren't priced well compared to DP / HDMI ones).

That crap hasn't changed in any fundamental way since the 50s, no joke. They kept adding "modules" that you had to pay for which supposedly gave the software new functionality. In reality, they were user requested changes to code that didn't work correctly in the first place. Companies were literally paying even more money for upgrades and updates that should have been provided by the vendor. The software was so error prone and full of bugs it made me shiver with rage every time we paid the maintenance agreement.
 The money they burned trying to keep that shit marginally functional was appalling. Support was sold to overseas call centers which made even the most mundane issue a days long slog. They would always promise big new changes were coming and year after year they would dole out a new sliver that made the software slightly more usable than before, for a price. It was just a glorified DB with no real higher functionality. Data mining was an arduous manual process with no tools etc. to facilitate. It relied heavily on external tools for basic use including a gawd awful java interface that barely functioned. 
 It was slow, clunky, and contained NO automation of basic daily tasks. I invented multiple ways to mine what we needed and analyze millions of records for pertinent data. The lack of even basic input checks meant people were entering erroneous data on the regular that needed to be pruned, edited, or replaced. It became my full time job just keeping the wheels on. I will never work for another business that uses that crap as long as I live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm a sys engineer at a dental lab. We use ups worldship with crossware right now. It reads and writes case info to a local mssql database to pull in each shipment's info and to write a tracking number to the case in the DB.
 We ship a lot, 350+ packages a business day easily
 Anyone that has dealt with worldship, knows it doesn't scale well to this volume, but I've made it work through weekly db maintenance on the admin and various tweaks etc. So yes it works, but it's the kinda free program that isn't really free and when there's a problem their support is useless and one of the IT team has to stay late.
 So I'm wondering if anyone here has a shipping platform they like that can do all these things. Cloud and web based would be amazing as long as they can pull up the shipment info by scanning an invoice, plop it on the usb scale, hit a button and then it prints on a networked label printer. We are currently in one building, but we are outgrowing it, so the quick scalability of a browser based cloud app is desirable. I imagine the ui would be more modern than the xp/Vista asthetic of worldship too.
 We've looked into a few, like shiprush for example but, while they would work, they seem geared more towards Ecommerce orders and the onprem sql integrations are an after thought.
 So anyone here have recommendations for a shipping platform geared more towards manufacturing enterprises?
 Thanks friends!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone can help me stop pulling my hair out.
 My client has a SonicWall as their router, and we use Shaw as an ISP. Shaw called me last month and said our router is pulling too many IPs (~500) when we are only assigned 5. Nothing has changed in our configuration that would have caused this - I have literally not touched this client's network in over a year.
 So, checking their settings from the ISP, looks like:
 WAN IP: 1.2.3.200
 Subnet: 255.255.254.0
 Gateway: 1.2.3.1
 We are assigned the static IPs .200-.204
 Right off the bat, I'm thinking - there are your 500 IPs, its just getting everything on the subnet they gave me. Due to the gateway address, I can't make it smaller than 255.255.255.0. When I make that change, guess what? Now there's only 200-something IPs being pulled. They swear the original settings are correct.
 When I look in the SonicWall logs, I see lots of "failed TCP packets" from some China IP with a destination of another IP on the subnet that is not in our block of static IPs (lets say it is 1.2.3.50). Is there something configured in the SonicWall that is doing this?
 I told Shaw that their equipment should be restricting the IPs to whatever they give us, and its not my fault/problem. They came and replaced their modem today and it still has the same problem - pulling way too many IPs. Their next step is they want me to factory reset the SonicWall and set it up from scratch - no way am I doing that!
 Any thoughts?

 My boss says it’s vital that every admin who makes an action on the information system (servers, firewalls, switchs…) write every one of them on an excel file for example. He says that when we have a problem, we can look into it if someone made a change that could be the trigger.
 Is it just me or is it a complete waste of time ? Because when there’s a problem, I track it to the root to be 100% sure. Of course, I write down commands sometimes when they’re complex and I make documentation for me or my colleagues.
 What do you think ? Do you have to do it in your jobs or did you ? If some does it, which software do you use ?
 Thank you !
 Edit : we already do CAB every week where we discuss every change, plan the action and the rollback plan, etc…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody!
 It has been a while that I was asking myself how big Datacenter operators like Hetzner or OVH do that magic that forces the MAC address and IP binding so that if you, for example, change the MAC address of a VM you won't receive any more package, although having the IP correctly configured. Is that static ARP? Or something else?
 Second part of the question: transparent PPPoE offloading. Is there any device that is capable to terminate the PPPoE session and transparently pass it as IPv4 to my client(s)?
 Bonus: is there an appliance that implements both features?
 As you might have imagined, the deployment scenario is a /27 that my provider delivers over PPPoE and I would like to offload the session on a dedicated appliance and then bind single IP addresses to different MACs in my DMZ.
 I have a 2.5G WAN so target speed is around that but could have few 2.5/10G ports since clients will mainly be 1G.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, As a network engineer for a large multinational, I am interested in skilling up in Cloud, but specifically Cloud networking. My problem is, to date my only involvement with cloud has been delivering the connectivity into AWS/Azure via Direct Connect or cross-connect. This is relatively straightforward and bread and butter for a network engineer. How does one actually get involved in the cloud side of networking? 
 Do your org have network engineers who specifically look after the cloud network only?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm in the process of evaluating some access layer switch replacements for the SMB I work at. Here is what I'm having a hard time deciding: 
 I am looking at either Cisco C1000 or Aruba CX6000 48 and 24 port PoE switches. Supply chain is like everything else right now and lackluster at best. They are also getting pretty expensive. 
 I can find "previously loved"/refurb Aruba 2530 or Cisco 3750X 48 and 24 port PoE switches that support our requirements for about 1/5 to 1/3 of the cost from a reputable supplier. Cisco 3750X is out of support and the 2530 will be soon, so no critical vulnerability patches when/if they happen. 
 Our perimeter will be secured with either Fortigate or Palo Alto and proper segmented network design, and these switches will sit only on the access layer. 
 What I'm struggling with is justifying the HUGE jump in price to go brand new. Yes, I realize it could prevent a potential failure, but these are also Cisco and Aruba switches that will most likely last 10-15 years without issue which has been my experience with both brands. If one fails, I can stock 3 in its place and still come out ahead. 
 Curious what the consensus is on missing out on vulnerability patches on switches that are at the access layer? Judging from other threads it's a mixed bag, but thought I'd see what kind of discussion comes up! 
 Thank you!

Which, hey, people need the internet and due to turn over and knowledge rot...okay. They just didn't tell us they were going to do that.
 Tuesday, a close partner company had an email account compromised and phished us. Forty people clicked the link. Whee remediation.
 Wednesday, that new method of spreading Qakbot and similar via one note attachments sent to old email chains that bleeping computer did a story about Tuesday bit us. Junior admin released the wrong email to a user, who apparently opens everything she gets ever. This was a baaaaaaaad how in the hell do you fall for this email. "Here's what you asked for, please see the attached document" with an email thread from two years ago below it. Fortunately, Microsoft Defender caught it and quarantined after she downloaded, opened, and tried to let it download the malware. My team kicks ass, we had it contained within ten minutes of the alert, then two hours to track down what the hell happened.
 Thursday, all is quiet. Time to focus on new direct reports, and put together a write up of Wednesday.
 Friday. Government agency that we have a required training with apparently glitches, and sends out a massive email blast to anyone who's taken any training from them about a "training booster 1 of 3" that looks like a phish but...nope. It's legit. With a sketchy office survey form. Queue our phishing inbox being flooded with 600+ emails. But at least my users are paying attention?
 I am very thankful it's Friday, and I'm not on call.

No matter how I redo our networks, re-create firewall and NAT rules the number of issues and bugs I run into just increases. The painfully slow hydra makes the already time consuming troubleshooting worse..
 The good thing I just learn that we are not tied to Sophos even if our licenses are still valid for some more time. 
 I'm free to choose new product(s), get these devices nuked and re-architect our network infrastructure. So here I am starting my weekend with researching alternatives

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on segmenting out a network that has previously been setup incorrectly. There are multiple VLANs setup in a flat network. Everything can see everything else. This post is not about fixing this issue. This will be looked at very soon.
 I am trying to setup a new VLAN for our IP Cameras. I'm using a combination of Ubiquiti and Aruba switches.
 Switch 1 is a Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch 48. Switch 2 is a Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch 16 XG. Switch 3 is an Aruba 1930.
 Here are the pertinent VLAN configurations:
  
 VLAN 10 IP 10.2.10.0/23 
  
 VLAN 50 IP 10.2.250.0/24 
 
 ​
 Here are the pertinent switchport configurations and notes:
  
 Switch 1 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 14 T U T T T To DHCP Server 10.2.10.2 
  Port 36 E U E E E PC gets 10.2.10.0 IP. WORKS PROPERLY 
  Port 38 E E E E U PC gets 10.2.250.0 IP. WORKS PROPERLY 
  Port 49 T U T T T To Port 1 Switch 2 
 
 ​
 ​
  
 Switch 2 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 1 T U T T T Connected to port 49 on Switch 1 
  Port 13 E E E E U PC gets 10.2.250.0 IP. WORKS PPOPERLY 
  Port 14 T U T T T Connected to port 48 on Switch 3 
 
 ​
 ​
  
 Switch 3 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 47 E E E E U Connected to PC. No IP 
  Port 48 T U T T T To Port 14 on Switch 2 
 
 ​
 The computer connected to Switch 3 port 47 does not get an IP from the DHCP server. I put Wireshark on the computer and see the DHCP Discover go out but do not see anything hit the DHCP server. If I manually assign an IP to the computer everything works fine. 
 A DHCP server relay is configured in Switch 3. 
 What am I missing?

 I'm reaching out to you as I'm absolutely clueless on what is going on. 
 I'm renting a colocation in a datacenter and have a bunch of servers connected via 10G Mellanox Connect X3 cards to a mikrotik crs317 switch.
 My primary uplink is a 10G SFP+ fiber provided by my upstream provider.
 The switch is doing regular switching, no firewall or routing rules are configured. 
 I started seeing upload speed issues on all but one of the servers.
 All servers are using exactly the same NICs + DAC + OS combination. 
 When running an IPerf test to a target outside of my network the download speed is sitting somewhere between 2-10Gbit/s but the upload speed is only at around 20MBit/s to 300Mbit/s. 
 But on one of the servers it works just fine and even the upload is at 2+ Gbit/s.
 ​
 Running an iperf test on the second port of the card (which is an internal LAN) I can reach 10Gbit/s both directions just fine. 
 I don't think the issue is my equipment but on the other hand I have no explanation why it works on one of the servers.
 Is there any logical explanation? 
 Thank you so much!

 Kindly assist, I previously posted a question but got too complicated with network engineer on site. They advised we do our own netwrok. Can someone please assist with a solution in the diagram?
 We've basically got two networks, one device on network 1 needs to communicate with another device on network 2. Network 2 is not allowed to have internet access.

 Their Active Directory user has been disabled, but the endpoint hasn’t phoned home in some time. This allows them to log in to the computer, likely using cached credentials.
 Is there a way to remove their access to this computer remotely? We might not have access to run remote commands through the network to their computer (PowerShell, Command Prompt, etc.) but may be able to run similar commands through TeamViewer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, my boss asked me about the possibility to put a VIP shared between two DNS Servers, so when one is down the other one takes on the virtual ip and start responding. 
 His idea is to provide some high availability when one dns server gets down. I really don't know if it makes much sense as we can set preferred and alternative dns servers. I saw here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn593685(v=ws.11)#dns-client-resolver-behavior#dns-client-resolver-behavior) that a windows machine will take 1 second to forward the lookup to the alternative dns server, I guess a VIP will take more time to pass to the other server.
 Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I am looking for a solution to automate the process of onboarding new users (and maybe even for offboarding tasks if possible). At the moment this is the flow of tasks:
 - HR is opening a ticket with the new user's details (name, position, department, manager, mobile phone number);
 - we're creating a Office365 mailbox via the on-premise Exchange cp (it's a hybrid environment) and that creates the AD user;
 - we add the details on the user's AD profile (all of the above, they are used for dynamic group membership mostly);
 - the user is synced to AAD;
 - we assign the O365 licenses as needed.
 Obviously, there's also the task of preparing the laptop, joining it to AD and Intune and install specific apps on it, but that's another discussion I believe, right now I want to focus on the other tasks that I mentioned.
 So, any of you have some ideas on how can this be automated? I know that there are HR apps that integrate with AD and could maybe do what we need, but I have no experience on this, I wouldn't know where to begin...
 Thank you!

 I'm seeing a lot of posts recently about sys admins values etc, a lot of them seem to be in fairly similar boats to me (small on site teams for a few hundred users) and they're saying they're on $60k+. I'm in the UK so of course the conversion rate plays a increasingly smaller factor in that, but I earn nowhere near that.
 It's highly likely that these sys admins do a lot more than me, but it got me thinking... What do you sys admins actually do in a fairly regular day to day? I'm hoping it might give me some ideas of what I want to do/what to expect as I further my career. I wouldn't mind being on 60K either!

 My agency just mandated that we move away from the usual SCAP scanner and implement a Navy-written tool called "Eval-STIG". Eval-STIG uses answer files to provide justification for "Open" and "Not Reviewed" items, but the format of that file is bewildering to me. Rather than using previous STIG-generated checklists, it uses a custom XML file to provide those status overrides.
 Is there a document or anything that anyone can point to for me that explains the formatting and correct usage of the XML fields in that answer file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, sysadmin in training here. As title says some of my users have been functionning in a very strange way. They have a shared mailbox which they CC on every mail they send. Team of 5, huge flow of mail. The result is 16k mails in 6 months, our plan allows for 50Gb of mails and it's already full. The apparent reasoning behind this is to allow anyone to access every conversation with clients should one of them be out of the office.
 Good Idea, bad execution they think mail storage is unlimited, and they don't want to delete old mails "in case", for now I set up an automatic archive but it's really slow and they've been complaining for a few days, some have the same problem on their own adresses. They're moving the mails manually from Inbox to the archive but that's just delaying the inevitable because the archive has a 50Gb max capacity.
 How can I solve this ? Anyone ever had this kind of situation?
 Thanks a ton, been learning a lot on this subreddit already!

 They are eager to move to AzureAD (or another cloud IdP) to remove dependency on On-Prem.
 My thinking is that each app that uses ADFS is going to be handled differently. And that each one needs to be "cutover", there is unlikely to be any way to stage or transition from one Identity source to another.
 For 365 and Sharepoint and other MS Apps, i plan to recommend using Staged Mode, as they have some automation and workflows that have the expected ADFS webpage hard coded into their authentication, so i will leave the identitites used there in ADFS until they are "dev'd" out.
 Staging mode should in no way affect the third party apps, am i correct?
 My method is along the lines of 
 Enable PHS in ADConnect & Seamless SSO -> Enable Staging Mode -> Migrate majority of Human Users to Staging Group (I can move the Automation Accounts as their devs update the app to support this)
 The above has no impact on the 3rd party apps, correct?
 But what about if/when i change my domain in AzureAD away from Federated to Managed? Does that impact?
 Ive been doing a lot of reading, and seen plenty of people say that they read too much into this, it ended up not being as complicated as expected. My issue is the client has a large regulated workforce that cannot accept significant downtime!

After the backup I deleted the virtual disk, created a new one and installed Windows Server 2019 on my server. Then I deleted the virtual disk again, created a new one and tried to restore it with the Paragon Software but then an error occures: Attributes of the target hard disk do not correspond to that of the selected archive! I guess due to the different representation of the hard disk. Now for Disk 0 two partitions, one with 2 TB and one with 1.49 TB are displayed I‘m wondering why the virtual disk is now displayed as two partitions with unallocated space and not as one partition with the complete storage of 3.49 TB

When trying to add a printer to one of the new Azure AD computers, the UAC prompt appears, I enter my Azure AD local admin credentials to allow driver install, and then after a bit, I get an "access denied" message.
 The event log shows: "The print spooler failed to import the driver that was downloaded from \\prt01\print$\x64\PCC\oemsetup.inf_amd64_a3d32de99448d391.cab into the driver store for driver 2507ci KX. Error code=800702e4. This can occur if there is a problem with the driver or the digital signature of the driver."
 This problem does not occur on the older on-prem AD connected computers. On them drivers are automatically downloaded from the print server and installed without issue.
 Why is the Azure AD joined computer unable to download print drivers from the print server? What do you guys think the problem could be? Any solutions?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering methods to connect remotely to my iMac across the internet from an iPad Pro. Ideally I will avoid services that enable the connection via an unrestricted server (udp holepunch) even when the service is advertised as encrypted (so teamviewer, jump and even vpns are excluded).
 I prefer direct connections (ssh for terminal access and rdp for the windows but don't like the risk associated with port forwarding. My solution is to implement tcp wrapper on the server and either restrict the client access to the smallest range of IP addresses from whichever location I am at or each time I connect, restrict the IP address to my actual IP address at the time. To configure the tcp wrapper I would connect to the server using jump and then once I have configured it take down that connection and then come in directly using rdp and ssh (with access restricted to my remote IP address only). The jump “daemon” will run for 5 minutes periodically (say, once or twice an hour) so the jump connection will only be available within that window.
 In summary use the udp holepunch style services (jump, Team viewer, vpn) as a way of initialising the direct connection and as a backdoor route if I manage to lock myself out but do 99% of my connectivity directly. If I am able to restrict access to just the range of IP addresses used by whatever ISP I am coming in from, I might only have to configure tcp_wrapper once for each ISP from which I am connecting. If that isn't viable, I am cool with re-initialising each time my remote IP changes.
 I should add that all my important passwords are 16 chars in length and all have lower case, upper case, numbers and special chars so I feel fairly protected against brute force attacks.
 what do you think of this plan?
 thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four years ago I got hired off a desk side tech job to just handle random service requests and account administration. I figured out how to semi-automate them in a month, and my boss got tired of finding things for me to do, so he put me on business analysis for our service processes and a migration.
 Three years ago we migrated multiple systems, our lead admin resigned on short notice, and I basically inherited his responsibilities over brand-new software and infrastructure. 
 Two years ago I got promised the lead job due, and a month later my VP-level boss got forced out and I was told 'you are a developer 100% of the time now, hand off all analyst and admin duties to....[null???]'
 A year and a half ago I got saddled with snd set up a new inventory system, migrated mobile to AAD and Intune, and refreshed 500 mobile devices mostly single-handedly, then got told to hand it off instantly to the help desk. No admin status, back to 'do what you're told' development.
 One year ago I wasted most of my time teaching other teams the basics of Agile, AD, business analysis, and got told I couldn't speak to other admins over Windows and Websphere and Salesforce because 'I caused more trouble by sharing information.' They replaced our business analysts and PMs with 'product owners' they scrounged from other departments and forced into roles they don't understand, and told us not to talk to the business or face consequences.
 Five months ago I interviewed for an asset manager position for $20k more in an entirely different department, got an instant offer, and my C-Level immediately calls to offer me the same pay scale and the long-promised lead position a day later, provided they put the job up for anyone to apply to. I explained I had an outside offer for double what I was just offered (but with way fewer benefits and leeway).
 I played hardball in 2022-2023, management got scared about losing me, and I finally got the job.

I said this isnt enough for me to do the audit and he just kind of shrugged. His boss is gonna be pissed though when all i provide them is a rack diagram and a port map.

They'll fly me to California or wherever if I need to learn something. I'm playing with the big dogs now.
 The son-in-law VP of Operations asked my new employer on getting a proposal together to see what it would take to keep them humming. Hopefully everyone wins.
 All in all I recommend just moving on, like some of you advised. The stress of the unknown was traumatizing at times. I gave up a sure thing for a shot at something better, and I got it.
 Edit: Big dogs, at least for here. Still rural Southern U.S.

 A few years ago I was walking to my office, and I passed by the door to our on premise data center. As I walked by my Spidey sense kicked off and told me that the smell wasn't quite right. I went into the DC and started sniffing around until I came to one of the UPS's. Then I realized what I was smelling was sulfur. Opened up the front and sure enough one of the batteries looked like it had gained about 10 pounds. Quick call to the company that maintains the batteries and we were good to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to apologize at the start if my question is overly simple. I'm self-taught in SQL and Server admin, and the guy that had previously setup the network I'm working on is out on medical leave (not expected back before go-live). 
 We're a small company, that recently decided to open a second location several states away from our current. Our current network is a 10.10.x/23 setup, with 1-79 reserved for static devices (servers, switches, printers, network connected manufacturing devices), and the rest as DHCP for internal and guest networks. We're very close to our 512 address limit. Our new location is expected to roughly need 20 more static addresses, and peak around 100 DHCP between internal and guest. My initial thought was to use the same DHCP host, expand the subnet to a 10.10.x/21, block of a larger range for statics, and expand DHCP range for the rest. 
 However, I get the impression that I can create the 2nd location network as it's own 10.10.x/24 range, and use DHCP Relay to enable communication without having to rework all of the local stuff. That should just require some changes to the initial DHCP, and DNS, but otherwise will all be configurable on the Firewall at location2?
 ​
 So in things needing adjusted in Loc1 (ex. 10.10.100/23)
 -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)
 -DHCP Host
 -DNS Host
 -rest of the network is no-change
 Loc2 (ex 10.10.200/23)
 -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)
 -rest of the network is nothing extra to setup
 ​
 Is this best practice? What other things do I need to be planning for and configuring before shipping the firewall and switches across the country?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. 
 I am bit baffled... I am doing some troubleshooting between my load balancer and backend server. When I perform a 'curl' from the load balancer, the load balancer sees "SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK" and then of course starts to push data. The server sees "SYN, SYN-ACK, but no ACK. It then does a retransmit of the SYN-ACK packets, and then gives up and sends a Reset. We do have a firewall in between, and although these two are in the same subnet (should just be switched) we see it hitting (the L3 gateways are configured on the firewall, so this might be expected). 
 What's more interesting, is I would think the LB should receive the reset and stop the data. It keeps sending, for a few seconds after the server had (suppposedly) reset the connection. 
 Thoughts?

 In interviews they always press what feels like "so...what have you actually done...". I have never physically touched a piece of equipment outside of a lab, designed anything, or had any major projects.
 I feel like I need to take a step back before I can advance. I dont mind taking a pay cut. But what roles should I shoot for? Junior, Associate, Mid level? I even see senior roles that look doable.
 Note: I said in the title "near CCNP level". I would not be able to pass the CCNP at this time. I am not asking about certification, though. What I mean by that is I hold and am beyond CCNA in terms of being valuable in troubleshooting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: What IT position routinely uses packet capture, wireshark, and other tools to solve problems?
 Here's the scenario: the company runs a public facing website for customers to HTTP POST order data. This endpoint is restricted in the firewall to a known Allowlist of customer FQDN and IP addresses. 
 Orders from a particular customer stopped flowing this week. We reached out to the customer Tech Support for assistance, no response. After a backlog of about $200,000 worth of purchase orders had stacked up, I dug in.
 I knew that the customer's app was trying to make a connection and assumed they were hitting us from an unknown and disallowed IP address. Using Packet Capture and wireshark, I was able to sift though all of the Scans, bots, and other nasty traffic and ended up correlating inbound dropped packets to outbound confirmation requests (from other TCP streams initiated by us). The source and destination IPs were different, but both in Google Cloud.
 I took an educated guess and whitelisted an unknown IP Address and the orders started flowing again.
 Turns out the customer had migrated their services to Google Cloud and had not informed their downstream vendors of the change. 
 I love this detective work, using wireshark to solve these kinds of mysteries and investigating what is otherwise "invisible".
 I'm a generalist - a mile wide and an inch deep but have recently developed a strong desire to specialize in networking or Cyber. Based on the Task Description above, what IT Job Title does this kind of work routinely?

This switch would have one wire feeding back to the main building (less than 100 metres) and feed into one port one of the current switches. 
 I have explained that this just isn't a good idea at all and that it would offer single point of failure, it likely won't be able to take the strain and a few other reasons.

 I'm a pro-AV engineer and we're looking to standardize on UPS units. We've been with TrippLite for decades, primarily using their SmartPro line of 1U units. They were inexpensive, and held up for the most part. 
 TrippLite is no longer selling to us direct as they are part of EATON now. and sales is through distribution like everyone else. This is fine, but with that costs go up. 
 But what about other brands? I see tons out there now and just don't have experience with anything other than TrippLite and APC (now part of Schneider). 
 I've installed a couple CyberPower units, and the first one I got failed in the first week. They RMA'd it and covered return shipping, but it meant a 4 hour drive to swap and swap back.. The replacement just failed again after 18 months (if that). 
 Middle Atlantic units seem expensive. 
 What's the verdict on Vertiv? I've seen them more than once in the wild recently. 
 Anything else I should look into?

 I’ve been tasked with figuring out how to access the 2nd router directly through the web UI, as currently we can access router 1 over its web UI, but can only access the 2nd router through SSH after first using SSH to access the 1st router. What would be the cause for being able to access the 2nd router this way, but not directly through the web UI? Any tips on how I can make this possible or what to check on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 for a project I want to fetch various information about switches using NETCONF. For this, I use ncclient (a python Library).
 From what I understood, capabilities are describing which information can be queried/configured on the device using NETCONF.
 When asking for capabilities, I get an answer which includes
  
urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system?revision=2014-08-06&module=ietf-system&feature=radius,authentication,ntp,ntp-udp-port
  
This looks promising, as I want to fetch the currently configured NTP Server. Checking the data model I would expect to be able to use a filter like this:
 <filter type="subtree"> <system xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system"> </system> </filter> 
 I followed the YANG model for ietf-system from here.
 I was expecting that a device which claims to have such a capability would then also allow me to read it. However, the docs for the device just mention setting it via NETCONF.
 Now I wonder:
  
did the manufacturer of the device not follow the NETCONF standard?
 
does "being able to configure it" also mean that I should be able to read it?
 
or am I doing something completely wrong here?
 
 Getting all interfaces (from urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces) seems to work as expected, but for ietf-system I get just an empty <data/> field back...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a network engineer for multiple offices around the world, I'm tasked with ensuring reliable access to SaaS applications and websites for my users. So I have redundant IPS and firewalls (Meraki) in each office and I set up the IPS in an active-passive state for failover. However, during a recent network incident where my primary circuit experienced 10% packet loss for a short time, The wan circuit did not fail over (Expected behavior for meraki FW Possible to take up to five minutes). causing some users to be unable to access certain services for three minutes. I know that i cant control the internet so once it leaves my firewall its outa my hands but Having the ability to show that it's out on the Internet Via a dashboard is nice.
 I currently use 1000 Eyes with Enterprise agents and endpoint agents for monitoring, but these tests only run every five minutes and may not be the best solution for my organization's needs. (I could increase the resolution of the tests, but the tests incur licensing costs) Right now, with 1000 eyes, I'm tracking the availability of Google's DNS, then my three main SAS applications, and local network gateway. Additionally, while the Meraki dashboard provides information it is limited and only tracks The network device's ability to communicate to meraki, and not able to track access to services.
 I am considering alternative solutions such as PingDom to track WAN availability by pinging virtual IPs and reporting on SLA. Another option is to spin up a service in Azure, where I have virtual networks with tunnels to each site. By testing communication through these tunnels, I can monitor the ability to reach the Internet and end-point devices. but not Necessarily, the network's ability to communicate to my Saas endpoints.
 I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or ideas for the best solution to monitor my network's ability to communicate with the outside world.

 got a job offer for 100k, probably around 10k "extra" per year in bonus and stock options. seems like a job i would enjoy at a huge company with lots of job opportunity and its work from home 2 days per week, but there are 2 big negatives...
 it would be a 1 hour commute (each way), but only 3 days per week, AND the other big negative is that its a 4 month rotating schedule of first and second shift. so 4 months first shift (7AM-4PM), then 4 months second shift (4PM-midnight).
 ​
 what would you do??? 
 ​
 EDIT: im 25 with only 2 years work experience in IT since graduation. at a small company literally impossible for IT job growth. This other company is a fortune 500 tech company
 RE-EDIT: wow, lots of differing opinions. If anyone is wondering. I'm 25 with no wife, kids, or responsibilities. I even live at home with my parents still so it would all be profit lol. Not sure if that changes anything

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so we are working on a deployment plan for Microsoft Laps across several environments and I'm looking into some of the timing questions. I've looked over the documentation and the overall setup/etc doesn't look too bad and we will run this through lab/pilot groups of course. 
 My questions is, is there any downside to predeploying the laps client (prior to schema changes/etc)? Getting the client out is easy enough (deployment solution)... but like everywhere else in the last two years our workforce has scattered across the country lol. The deployment could take a week or two to complete and for some units we may want to be a bit more aggressive on the timeline to rollout.
 Also, any thoughts on this being deployed for servers? Again... this seems pretty strait forward assuming avoiding things like domain controllers/etc. Any other big gotchas we should be looking for/might see?
 Should have added...most of our environments are fairly simple domains but some are wide spread. In any case, I appreciate any thoughts or insights into this (even beyond what is mentioned). In any case thanks for your time if you got this far :)

I checked it out and it was just the lifters on the oscillating vent, but since we don't have a service contract on it and we've been in budget crunch for a few months now I just put off looking at it for another day.
 Came in this morning and the clunking sound is gone. So - as of this moment, the AC unit is both working ("alive") AND not working ("dead") until of course I open the door. Logically speaking I don't need to look at it - right? LOL.
 All kidding aside, the iDRAC controllers on the Dell r730xd's haven't thrown a temperature error /yet/ so I know it's still working. However, I know they're going to ask me to McGyver the hell out of that unit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks!
 I'm currently on a bit of a side quest for my IT team to explore the viability of shifting most of our org over to Google Meet to save some costs from Zoom. I can find plenty of pros and cons online about the general features and performance of each platform but I have a very specific concern about this potential switch over and that is the control and admin of the cloud recordings, let me explain.
 Zoom has a wonderful admin interface that allows us to see all cloud recordings in one place, this is used mainly in our Sales department. It is especially helpful when a user leaves the business, we are able to transfer all their Zoom cloud recordings to their line manager as we delete their Zoom account with ease.
 Google Meet seems to have a very bare bones approach to Meeting recordings. By default it will just save a recording to the meeting hosts Gdrive and that's it, no option to transfer to another user (i.e their manager) and no centralised control over these recordings.
 ​
 Am I totally seeing this wrong or is Zoom the clear winner in recording management with the meetings and calls?

 We're using Lightspeed MDM. I don't like it. But it's what we got. I've looked all over the administration pages, can't find anything. Neither in their documentation. I would have thought sharing files would have been a more needed feature?

 Environment - separate networks/NIC's, external switch not sharing management, different vlan. Hosts are on small isolated network while VM's are for intranet.
 Any tips on making it more secure? Shielded VM's are opposite what we are looking for as these seems to secure VM's from rogue Admins so doesn't look like that is an option.
 As far as I can find at the minute it looks like the only way to hop between VM and Host are Microsoft vulnerabilities, please correct me if I'm wrong.
 Else, PowerShell Direct, while I do use it I never had a concern connecting 2 different environments together, any concerns here? Or again it would come down to vulnerabilities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I'm working with a client that prefers to create independent shared mailboxes for every shared CALENDAR they would like added. Sometimes these calendars are created in the user's account and shared out. 
 I'd rather create them under one shared mailbox like "Finance" and have multiple calendars underneath and shared out so they can be centrally managed. Creating multiple shared calendars under a shared mailbox can be done in OWA. I'm finding this is difficult to manage, however, and these calendars cannot then be located in the GAL so I suppose an invite is required. This is AFTER granting the user full delegation to the shared mailbox and still finding the calendar is not visible in outlook 365 client... But it exists in OWA. 
 How does everyone manage shared calendars without creating a ton of shared mailboxes?

 I've made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications, aimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host their infrastructure. Because today lines are kinda blurred between sysadmin and DevOps I'm posting this here too hoping someone might find it useful.
 To get this out of the way - this course doesn't cover Kubernetes or similar - I'm of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals, you probably don't need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.
 As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even…]]></summary>

Sometimes Outlook will spontaneously complain that his 500gb disk is full and refuse to work, only to be all fine and dandy after a restart. When i inspect his mac he usually has ~300gb of free space left.
 Uptime is usually ~8 hours (one working day). I have observed him shut down his mac correctly when he leaves work and experience the error the next day. Sometimes it takes weeks before it comes back and sometimes it comes back the next day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We were staging our Fortigate HA firewalls for migration and had to perform an upgrade to the latest code 7.2.4. Before performing the upgrade we forgot to disable the NAT rules on the Fortigate which were running parallel with Palo Alto firewalls. 
 During the upgrade firewalls failed over and the ARP table on our ISP gateway got updated with new ARP entries from Fortigate (GARP sent during HA failover). And users lost access to some of the servers NAT'ed on outside. Since we don't have access to the ISP gateway to clear ARP cache, we needed to contact the ISP support, unfortunately no one responded in a timely manner.
 So the situation is that we need to wait till the arp timer expires in the ISP gateway and we don't know how long it takes and we cannot afford a long outage. So we had to fix this issue asap without performing a failover or any changes in Palo Alto to trigger GARP. 
 Then we found this command  test arp gratuitous ip <ip/netmask> interface <interface name>  which would manually trigger a GARP and it saved our day. It updated the upstream ISP gateway ARP tables. I know that we could do this in Cisco ASA and Firepower but wasn't aware that this is available in Palo. I think there is no such command available in Fortigate to manually force GARP (but I think we can set a timer for GARP in the vip).
 Sharing this as it might come handy for someone who ends up in the same situation as we were.

 I have a fan blowing air out of there which definitely helps cool the area. Generally if it’s a warm day I’ll have the air con on as well, the server fans will kick in if it gets too warm. Sounds like a jet taking off, lol. 
 It’s a HP DL380 if that makes any difference. 
 Would I be best to lift it slightly off the shelf to allow air flow underneath?

 I'm in the planning phase of rolling out an OS upgrade (from Windows 7, sigh) for a small business.
 I've been talking to the software manifacturer company about the latest suggested requisites and they told me to go with either Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise or Windows Server 2019 (not sure if 2022 would work as well).
 The thing is that the software is multi-user using RDP. They suggested, instead of acquiring CAL licenses, to buy an RDP server implementation from another vendor (TSplus, never heard of that before) which is supposedly cheaper.
 That made me wonder if there are other alternatives (possibly an open source implementation of the RDP protocol). Windows Server is not really my thing (and it would run inside an hypervisor) and that's why I'm asking here.
 Thank you in advance.

 OneLogin customer here....
 I was wondering if you can still setup Conditional Access with OneLogin and Microsoft, if OneLogin handles all of the authentication requests.
 Currently when a login is entered at 365, it redirects back to OneLogin.
 If Conditional Access is configured (e.g. for outside the country) - would it still kick in regardless of the redirect?
 I don't believe OneLogin has this feature, so curious to know if anybody has set this up, and is it still possible?

 I've used the InstallSheild response recording function and that does work to create a replayable install. However...
 As part of the install it takes credentials (passwords) for some initial user accounts that it will create. I'd like to template the response file automation so that I can supply different credentials for these accounts during the build.
 The response file records these passwords as strings of the form !CRYPT!XXXXXXX... or !CRYPTEX!XXXXXXX... (where XXXXXXX is a long sequence of numbers).
 These data items could either be recording a hash of the password data, or could be reversible encryption of the actual password itself.
 I'm assuming these items are using a standard InstallSheild function to generate the values and handle the encryption/decryption required.
 Does anyone have any information on what this encryption implementation is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the past couple of weeks, we've been having random power cuts, after the first one, we noticed that the majority of our machines would stop loading any web pages for up to 30 seconds or so and then work again, but completely randomly, never all at the same time.
 ​
 consistent ping/tracert would run but pages would still not load. so clearly a DNS issue.
 ​
 Check the DNS logs and find that we would get SERVFAIL (2) errors, doing a packet capture would also show the same thing.
 ​
 We have DNS on a DC and all our machines point to that server for DNS, we also have another site with a second DC and almost identical site setup and they doesn't have this issue.
 ​
 We changed the forwarders to use our ISP's DNS servers instead of 8.8.8.8/4.4 , 1.1.1.1 etc in case we were swamping them with DNS requests, we have a lot of devices on our network so thought it could be a problem. Alas, still have the issue.
 ​
 We originally thought it was a Meraki switch that was causing routing issues, but it has been disconnected and the problem still remains.
 ​
 the DC with the issue seems to behave differently to the other DC as well, If I ping the DC hostname from the DC it will return ::1 where as the second DC responds with the correct v4 address. A bit of a google has suggested changing ipv4 preference over IPv6, but not sure if this is going to make much of a difference. waiting on a good time to reboot the server for the regkey to take effect.
 ​
 It could be the firewall, though I cant see anything in the logs for any DNS requests that are being denied.
 ​
 any suggestions on what the issue might be or where you might look next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 ​
 As you know AS2 uses PKI to send/receive files securely.
 When it's time to renew the private key, you send your public key to your partners. That part is clear. 
 But who decides the actual point in time when the switchover from old to new occurs ? AS2 uses a 1:N relation, you have 1 private key for n partner relations, so switchover should be done in concert.
 But looking at my AS2 server (mendelson) it appears not to "try" to use its new key when a partner sends a file using our new public key. It knows both its old and new keys.
 Is this some RFC all AS2 implementation suffer from or just un-user-friendly implementation ?
 I have a hard time believing I have to send a precise date/time to all my AS2 partners to make switchover successfull ?
 ​
 thanks

I have no idea what happened, but if you ask me, every and any lucky event or windfall is random and every person is to a very large extent a victim of circumstance. There is room for movement that accounts for drive, effort, ability or capabilitiy but it is insubstantial enough to not matter in comparison to the random events.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had to replace a label printer (zebra gx420d -> zebra zd620). Just called our printer vendor, asked for direct replacement as I don't know too much about this I relied on their knowledge but I am starting to think it was a mistake, not sure still, maybe you guys can help.
 So issue is the printouts are smaller. They are good quality, not cropped, just downsized ~30% centered in the middle. This is a packing station, we print over network directly from SAP spooler, labels are .pdf.
 I tried everything humanly possible from direct import of the config file from other zebras to side by side going through both internal config utility and ZSU, gave it an hour or two of tinkering and then gave up (ultimately, barcode so it's usable it just looks funny and bit hard to read).
 So the main difference what I found was printer resolution. Old was 203dpi, new is 300dpi. I couldnt find any up/downscaling settings in neither of setup utilities.
 Is dpi the problem here and if so, is there any trick to upscale printouts with zebra label printers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have switches connected together via trunk link. It was working until yesterday. I console into the switch and found the trunk link to be in err-disable, so I shut and unshut the port. The state changed to connected, and still no traffic getting through.
 The trunk that was working was 10G MMF fiber. I could still see the other switch via CDP, but no traffic getting through. I changed the SFP+ on both ends, and I was able to ping the other switch, but it was really bad. When I sent 100 pings to the other switch, it would timeout at random intervals. 80/100 success rate. The trunk link is at 10G full-duplex on both ends. 
 I tried 1G SFP, and still no dice. The 1G SFP MMF states were down down. So I went back to SFP+.
 I swapped the fiber from orange to aqua, and it was worse. With aqua fiber, there is no traffic at all, but CDP is working. I changed ports and still no traffic. I swapped to copper, and the same - CDP is working, but no traffic getting through. 
 The config on each port is the same. Upstream Switch (i think it is a 3850):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 nonegotiation  Downstream Switch (I think it is a 3750):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q nonegotiation  This whole time the 3850 led was green, but the 3750 was amber. Again, each link shows 10Gbps at full-duplex. I have rebooted both switches and only CDP is working. I'm hitting a wall at this point. What else could I do to troubleshoot this trunk link?

 I've been posting here before about an MLAG setup I did and I have some more questions.
 So I have an MLAG topology, see https://imgur.com/dRFkzAJ 
 The setup is:
  
Two fortigate firewalls in HA mode, A/P. I run LACP on two ports, port 1 and port 2.
 Two NK9 switches are vPC pairs.
 The switches are pure layer 2, we run only layer 2 on the switches (only L2 VLANs). All the default gateways are configured in the firewalls.
 Internet terminated in the switches. I do NOT have two ISPs, it is only one ISP that provides us two circuits or two handoffs that terminates on my both switches. They (the ISP) run VRRP on the router so my internet next-hop or default gateway is the VIP. Basically, the internet connection (setup) is a QinQ where they handoff two transport VLANs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit! This is a question for all you experienced sysAdmins.
 I am planning a on-premise server setup and have a question mainly about user management. This is for a future production environment. I am taking the sysadmin role in a small company and I originally learned computer sciences with a focus on application development, so while I know the basics I am missing a lot of experience with implementing servers. 
 What I want to do:
 I'll have a central Ubuntu server that runs as a NAS and possibly run VMs for workloads (simulations, renders and a database). I need to manage permissions for user groups and individual users. I also want access via VPN for homeoffice users and would like to manage a universal login for every user (would be perfect to be able to import these) and not have several logins. 
 I am aware of Windows Active Directory but since I decided not to bother with Windows as my server OS (mainly because of licensing and compatible database software) I want to do that on a Linux Server. 
 Basically I want to manage access so that only specific groups of users or specific users can access certain folders, thats the most important thing right now. There are aproximately 30 users but the number will grow in the future. Clients are all using Windows and if I could use the windows login as authentication for server access that would be perfect.
 Its my first time planning a complex server setup from scratch with user management, but I want it to be well plannned and documented, so any help and advice would be appreciated. I am open to suggestions about the general server or network architecture and the software I'll use, but my Hardware needs to at least host a NAS, a DBMS and ideally a VM.
 Please let me know if anny more information is necessary and thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 Here is a drawing of the setup: https://imgur.com/6iIYJ2Y
 Can someone please advise. We're installing a solar system at a client. Our solar network needs to communicate to 192.168.0.100 to get data from their existing electrical infrastructure. Their 192.168.0.100 is not connected to the internet due to security reasons, it's literally got an unmnaged switch with no router even, we are allowed though to connect onto that network as long as their computer doesn't have any internet access. Secondly, we've got a TV in the entrance of the building displaying data from the solar for the clients to see, it's almost a 800m run so would rather want to utilise and try to work through their existing network, running a new cable is very hard due to access.
 I please need assistance on how to get traffic from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.5 without interfering with their existing network (not sure if it's called port forwarding?). Client has a network engineer on site but I'm getting the feeling he's not 100% sure how as nothing has been actioned yet, I can hopefully relay info from here to him and see if he finds a way.
 Then I please need assistance on how to get traffic to and from 192.168.0.100 from 192.168.2.2 , is it perhaps port forwarding on the Teltonika and Cisco side? And then setting up a firewall rule on the cisco side to not give internet access to 192.168.2.2?
 I can, going to be hard though, run a seperate cable from the Teltonika straight to the 192.168.0.100 network and then the 192.168.0.100 network is not going to be connected to the Cisco network at all, but then I'll need advise on how to set up on the Teltonika side to not give internet to 192.168.0.100 but still be able to access it.
 Thanks in advance for any assistance!

We're moving a government org into M365 and maintaining and upgrading other server infrastructure stuff, and it is sooooo nice having two levels of IT helpdesk BEFORE tickets get to me!
 Also, there's a bit of fear looking at new systems I am now responsible for running (Airwatch, eDiscovery and Purview, Security, etc), but then super fun getting to dive in, learn the magic isn't inscrutable, show my ability to pick stuff up quickly and contribute, share the load with my awesome, and very-much-more-experienced-in-many-ways team, and they clearly appreciate the value I'm bringing, even as a totally new person to their org and team.
 Not knocking my prior gigs. They were good, the teams were good, we did good work together. This is not a whole 'nother level from what I've done before, but I'm not out of my depth, it's just a bigger challenge and I'm having loads of fun in an environment that seems to really want its members to succeed.
 Also today I helped in my first real security remediation, and using Security and Purview audit logs I was able to piece together the critical info showing how the email made it to an inbox, and confirmed what data we need to do that so much more quickly next time. So I might be riding a bit of a high.
 Anyway, if you read this far, thanks. New job good, this day good. All good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently have a cradlepoint to connect some remote equipment back to AWS cloud. It works okay but not really a fan of the UI and the subscriptions are getting expensive. I realize there is a hardware + software piece here. I'm okay with putting together my own hardware - just need a good software solution. I've done a bit of research - but haven't found anything that sticks out as a clear winner.
 ​
 Key Needs:
  
Robust change management (file based so it's git compatible)
 Tolerant of minor config errors so we can still get in to rollback changes (similar to how netcloud w/cradlepoint works as this will be at remote sites)
 Easy button to VPN connect a local network (OpenVPN, wireguard, etc)
 Management of local WiFi interfaces on the device
 Management of backhaul (4G/5G) modems on the device
 Preferably no need to ever login to it - can do everything by pushing config somehow (centrally managed).
 Prefer something that can be installed on ARM, but X86 is also fine.
 Centralized logging/reporting
  
​
 Basically I'm looking for something that is always reachable via 4G/5G modems (assuming the network is up w/valid service of course) - and allows remote configuration of WiFi APs and VPN backhaul of locally attached devices.

 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get why we see a disproportionate amount of posts where people are venting about something stupid going on with their job. If things are smooth sailing, there’s nothing really to post about.
 The amount of negative posts though can likely turn off people looking change their career or enter the workforce from considering this as an enjoyable career choice. I find it to be very leisurely with rare moments of frustration or stress.
 Maybe it would be good to have flair specifically for sharing a good change or policy that has been implemented at your work, or how you were able to find that one person with vendor support who was able to solve the problem you’ve been dealing with for months.
 Alternatively there could just be a weekly recurring thread that just contains positive anecdotes.

The company came up with an idea of an app that would be able to combine all the existing content that company have plus some premium features for children education especially in remote and rural areas. So we were 8 people in the team me and co worker that will work on the backend and front end, 2 backend engineers for the api and database work , 2 artists, 1 scrum master and one and only product manager.
 When we had our first team meeting it was stated that application will specifically be targeted to children and should be shown in the kids categories of the store page, we discussed some parameters of the application than we moved towards technical aspects of the game.

 So, our git instances are VERY out of date. We're playing catch up on updates right now. It happens.
 Two weeks ago I announced my upcoming maintenance. I brought it up every day at least in passing to announce it. Explained it is going to take me nearly 3-4 hours to complete. It's just how it is. I told my teammates to let their pods know that I'm going to be doing this. I was very clear. However, an emergency happened and my coworker assured me they would have it done quickly so it didn't hold me back....
 Maintenance was supposed to start at 8 pm. 8:30 the pm they work with contacts me asking where they are. I don't know. I offered to do the maintenance for them so it doesn't slow me down. They declined saying that the person will be there soon.
 8:45 they show up. I send them a message telling them to let me know once they're done so I can get started. 9:45 rolls around and nothing. I assume it's going bad so I offered to help. Nothing. I contact the pm. Nothing. I wait a few more minutes then get a message from the pm saying they've been done for a little while ago and he's surprised no one told me.
 It's now 10 pm. I've got a long maintenance to complete... And I'm the Early Morning team (I start at 7 am)
 Thanks. Really. I didn't want to sleep anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to build a portable WiFi AP kit in a pelican case. The goal is to bring this case to an event that is small to offer up internet service for our staff. The small mobile hotspot is just not working great and the area of coverage is too small.
 Any advice or equipment do you recommend
 Case- Will be a Pelican Case maybe the 1525 or 1535. 
 Router/Switch Need help with this the most. I'm looking for the following specs if possible. Most important on top.
 - Compact 4/8port that fits in a case that wont generate too much heat
 - Fast start up
 - ipsec/vpn back to edge server
 - PoE+ for the AP but maybe i will just use a POE injector in the case
 Power- PDU with 4 outlets or 3?
 WiFi AP's- I have these already
 Connectivity will be from the portable hotspot on a Carrier SIM with an ethernet connection to the router/switch. I was thinking of getting a router/switch with built in support for carrier sim's but the cost is just crazy
 There's two ways the first one is the easiest but the least secure. But i'm looking to build both solutions 
 1) ATT Mobile portable hotspot as wan to a router/switch and the WiFI ap will connect to that. All management is done via the cloud. Easiest to setup but all traffic will be on ATT network
 2) Att mobile portable hotspot as wan to a router/switch that has ipsec back to our network so the WiFi ap will be on our network and we have internal monitoring tools and all traffic will be going through our firewall and filter.

 just wondering what you guys driving for a laptop on a daily base. I am looking for a new one so maybe I can get some inspiration.
 I am working in IT - Server management
 currently got a Lenovo t14 from work with their image so its not my personal one. looking for a windows machine with bright display and maximum 2560px resolution, bc too much is bad for battery. life. I want to be able to work a whole day. I know that's not possible but maybe there is a laptop for 8h use with simple tasks like surfing and doin ssh. Also important for me is the performance. I want desktop class performance when I need it for adobe e. g. and want to be able to turn off the GPU and use the CPU integrated one for maximum battery life... might need to write a script for that^^ Screen size between 14 and 16 inch. 14 inch is a bit to small for me but would work.
 ​
 Looking into getting the X1 Extreme from Lenovo.
 What are you guys running and in which use case? What are you looking for when choosing a laptop? What are features you need? (RJ45, HDMI, ...)

 I decided to do myself and this sub a solid and do a legit interview with this company on my Friday afternoon.
 HR and the IT manager both had cameras off the whole time, and the IT guy proceeds to describe their environment to me. He says they have over 400 employees, but “only about half” have accounts and/or computers. Patches and backups are automated, you rarely need to be there after hours, etc. So overall, maybe it isn’t on fire?
 Either way I received notice that I was not selected, maybe since I was firm with my asking amount. All for the best, I suppose, since I found out the IT guy is related to the owner, after reading about some of their current and past lawsuits online…also, they asked several times if I was currently employed, which is obvious that I am, and that seemed like a red flag to me.
 Stay picky out there!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little over a year ago we got a new CIO. We have only had one CIO during the entire existence of my employer’s existence so this was all new to everyone. We hired someone from out of state who has previously worked as IT director for a company about 5x our size. We are a medium sized company with about 5,000 employees worldwide. Up until recently everything has been business as usual with no significant changes. 
 Today I heard that a company called TCS will start supplementing our work to help complete projects and handle day-to-day support. It was explained to us that this will allow us to drive more strategic concepts and leave support. 
 My boss scheduled a meeting with me for next week to go over the SOW and the SOW was attached to the meeting. I looked it over and it consists of several different areas (servers, databases, VMWare). These are my key competencies. 
 TCS is quoting a yearly cost that is half of my salary.
 I asked my boss why my areas of expertise are subject and it was simply reiterated that I should focus on strategic work and let TCS handle the daily and we will talk more in the meeting next week.
 I feel like I may be in the chopping block but maybe I’m looking into it. Does anybody have any experience with this type of situation?

 I firmly believe that if you don't participate in these things and push vendors to be better then they never will be.
 But I've also got enough shit on my plate that I can't afford to waste my time answering nonsense questions with TAC or whatever, and I don't owe the vendors one half of one fuck.
 How about y'all? For example: I've got a batch of PA Firewalls that insist on doing panorama connectivity checks after I change the management IP (a fine idea)... but they start doing these checks before the new IP has actually been applied (a deeply stupid idea) resulting in those checks of course failing and config reverting, even with several retries configured. This is confirmed with ping and ARP.
 So obviously a bug, but also there's a dumb but effective workaround of "just tell the firewalls to retry EVEN MORE times, hur hur". Would you invest your time in reporting it to the vendor?

I have been tasked with upgrading the dated FI 6248’s on this network I am on. What I am looking for, is some type of upgrade guide on which parts should be upgraded first. Like, chassis => iom => blade? Or opposite? Mix? Or it doesn’t matter?
 I have looked online and I have been unable to find anything. Is this one of those “ancient networking secrets”? Or is that I am just a terrible googler(is that even a term??) 
 This is my first time having to perform an upgrade on the FIs, as the VM guys usually handles that. But, since there are no VM guys, well, you get the idea. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

 This automatically enables the API to listen on every layer 3 interface on the switch... EXCEPT Management1. This is problematic, because we use the IPs of the Management1 interfaces for DNS across all of our TOR switches, and using a spreadsheet just isn't acceptable in my environment. 
 Does anyone know a way to enable the API on a management interface? Is it even possible? I'm going open a case with Arista to ask about it, but figured I would also try you fine folks too.

 ISP fiber comes in to their switch, and then runs 1G CAT6 to my firewall. My firewall has a 10G fiber connection to a Cisco switch, and this switch goes out via 1G Ethernet to my network. Nothing else is connected to this switch at this time.
 My ISP has suggested that I enable flow control on my switch, but my 10G link shouldn't be getting anything over 1G since that's what it has further upstream and downstream, right? Would flow control really do anything in this setup?

 I'm back today with everyone's favourite: self-doubt!
 ​
 So I've been in my position close to a year now, and while I'm constantly being told I'm doing good work by keeping an old system stood up, and bringing its security forward from 2016, the self-doubt has recently been creeping in. besides the fact that my fresh out of college skills were already lacking as a 1.5-man team I'm starting to feel like I'm stagnating right before i can call myself fully fledged. I say 1.5-man-team since while the one keeping the system standing for the last 3 years is here, his department is of course first, so we call him affectionately "the production duck"

 The vendor is giving them a choice on how to earth the keystone panels. Their recommended option is to drill a hole on the floor and drive a rod into the earth in the computer room and bond all of the keystones to that. This coincidently is the most expensive solution.
 Their next best option is to simply run a heavy copper ground wire from the electrical system ground to each rack and bond the keystones to that. They say this will work, but is still vulnerable to problems.
 Option #1 seems like way overkill to me. 
 I'm suggesting that they not go with shielded cable, but in case they decide shielded, what recommendation do I give them about grounding options?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I received an email from my FS account manager this morning indicating that in the past year Microsoft has been purchasing FS equipment because Dell has failed to meet delivery commitments. 
 I know a lot of the users I've talked to on this subreddit have been weary of utilizing FS equipment. (Some due to TAA concerns, some due to OS concerns. (FSOS / ONIE), etc)
 But this is a pretty big move that will legitimize FS beyond just optics. I personally swapped my production stack from Cisco to FS around 2 years ago, it was an easy transition and has been rock solid ever since. They never have issues with inventory, I've received my orders within days, and support while a little lackluster due to some obvious language barriers is pretty responsive.
 I'm curious if this triggers any others to take the plunge on FS now. I'm also curious to see how FS handles the demand, if their supply is able to stay consistent, it could be a real game changer since Dell/HP/Cisco/Juniper lead times have been abysmal.

 we are installing a dHCI system from a client, and I'm trying to figure out what transceivers I need to order in order to provide uplink from the dHCI switches (HPE SN2010M - Basically a Mellanox rebrand) to the client's ToR switch in that cabinet which is a Juniper EX4600.
 According to HPE, the only available Xciever I have available which is 40G SR is the "HPE M-series 40GbE QSFP28 SR4 100m Transceiver" with SKU Q7F11A.
 The appropriate transceiver on the Juniper side is QFX-QSFP-40G-SR4.
 This is where I'm lost, the Juniper site clearly states that the transceiver lister above is MPO-12, but HPE simply says MPO - I can't figure out if it's MPO-12 in which case I need a simple MPO-12 cable or of the HPE Transceiver is an MPO-8 one in which case I'm not sure which cable to use because I can't find an MPO-8 Transceiver that is compatible with the Juniper EX4600. Help me, please!

How many times have I sat in a DevOps interview to be told I was the only candidate with basic networking knowledge, it's mind-boggling. Hell, a lot of people can't even produce a CV that's worth a dime.
 Kids can't use computers, and it's only getting worse, while more and more higher- and higher-level skills are required to figure out your way through all the different abstractions and counting.
 How is this ever going to work in the long-term? We need more skills to maintain the infrastructure, but we have a less and less IT-literate population, from smart people at dumb terminals to dumb people on smart terminals.
 It's going to come crashing down, isn't it? Either that, or AI gets smart enough to fix and maintain itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company merged with another one and we've been running two separate offices connected by IPSEC VPN. Windows domains with a two-way trust. The two buildings can currently talk to each other's devices as things stand today. Now I've been asked to move some (but not all) of the equipment from one office to another: VMware Host, NetApp and the ESXI switch stack. I can do basic switch configuration, trunks and vlans and whatnot but networking isn't my strong point. I know enough to hurt myself on the sharp edges. What I'm wondering is: 
 If the Core Switch (lets say its 10.1.1.1) is at Building A, if I move the ESXI switch (10.1.1.2) to the other building, is it possible for me to keep it on the 10.1.1.0 network and pass through Building B's core switch with vlans and static routing (Building B is on, say, 10.50.0.0 network) and across the VPN to talk to other 10.1.1.0 resources, or is it going to be easier to re-IP everything I am moving over and let the existing routing handle it? We're trying not to do that because a lot of their network shortcuts the users have are coded to the IPs and not DNS names. Which is silly, yes, I know. 
 Looking for advice as to what the "best" thing to do would be. And yes, I realize that hiring a networking professional is the Best thing to do, but there is no money in the budget for that. I'm going to have to figure this one out. And of course, they want it done this weekend.

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the ongoing ransomware campaign, known as “ESXiArgs.” Malicious actors may be exploiting known vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi servers that are likely running unpatched and out-of-service or out-of-date versions of VMware ESXi software to gain access and deploy ransomware. The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable. 
CISA has released an ESXiArgs recovery script at github.com/cisagov/ESXiArgs-Recover. Organizations that have fallen victim to ESXiArgs ransomware can use this script to attempt …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I was wondering if any of you have had success measuring TX/RX in LibreNMS for an Adva FSP150 model and if so how you did it, I am running firmware 19.7.2 on the Adva and Libre is on 22.6.0 (this is likely not upto date with the latest release, I'm currently stuck due to work change control etc....)
 I have Juniper devices on librenms where under health I have dbm which shows me the readings and graphs of the individual ports for TX & RX, I would like this for the Adva device. I'm assuming as LibreNMS identifies the Juniper as a Juniper but the Adva as a Generic Device this is why I see this difference.
 I have checked the definition and discovery files within Libre and Yaml files do exist for measuring the TX and RX of Adva_FSP150 ports. I took the OIDs being used in this file and set them up as custom OIDs in libre with Gauge selected and dbm as my unit, I do see graphs under customer OIDs but no data being pulled. When I created the customer OIDs I ran a test which said value returned & successful.
 I think my next step will be downloading a MIB browser and checking to ensure the OIDs I have from the YAML file are correct.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be most appreciated

The few computers they do have are in the offices, this is where the owners of the company work, if they aren't on the floor. They have about 7 computers, a small Synology NAS, and the new backup storage server.

 I'm having a little bit of an issue. We are getting weird network drops and packet issues and I suspect it's coming from an MTU Change
 we recently configured all our interfaces on our Dell FTOS Devices to have MTU of 9216
 via 
 mtu 9216
 Our VLAN Interfaces and Port Channels do not have any MTU statements. Currently our ESXI Boxes are now showing less than ideal performance and acting as if there is a performance drop via network (pings randomly dropping for 10 seconds at a time under load). The ESXI Boxes have vSwitches set at 9000 which is their max.
 I noticed their may be an ip mtu config. Would this also need to be set?
 ​
 Any Advice?

 Column A has the data source Column B,C not filled in as not required for onedrive Column D has the email address for the onedrive user Column E has the folders. I've done this for each folder I would like to move, Pictures, Desktop, Documents so three columns for each.
 Column F I have the same as column E thinking it would put whatever was in the pitures to pictures in onedrive ect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just moved from tier II to system admin for a small company. To say I’m a little overwhelmed is an understatement but I think that’s how it goes. Anyway I have a pretty serious problem I think and would def appreciate some advice. 
 So the company I’m working for conducts certification training and has 100 or so workstations (split between 15 corporate employees and 85 student computers). Every computer has windows 10 enterprise installed but I have no clue where the licensing information is. The computers are also so old there’s no original license key burned into the motherboard. The admin who set this all up died and his replacement was clueless. When a computer needed to be reimaged he used keys from visual studio :( (all I can do is put a sad face here). 
 So here’s my question, am I right to assume that I would need to contact a license broker and purchase a windows 10 pro volume OEM license? Does anyone have any idea how much that might cost for 100 computers? 
 Also, I think enterprise would be better for the corporate employees. We already have E3 licenses and are a silver partner with Microsoft. Once there’s a legit windows installation and the machine is added in azure I think that would check that block, but would there be any reason to also upgrade student computer from pro to enterprise (I don’t think so)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just looking to replace some aging ASR1002 routers. We use this for eBGP and with the routing table nearing 1 million routes we need to either start filtering routes or preferably replacing them with hardware which can cope with much more routes. 
 As part of this upgrade we are also looking to increase the transit links from 10Gb links to 100Gb links as well as any uplinks to our core. 
 At the moment we have several transits coming in so we want to look at potentially having two transits per router so that's 2 x 100Gb and then we also want dual uplinks for reslience so 4 x 100Gb in total. 
 Unfortunately this takes the C8500-12X4QX out of the picture as it won't support 4 x 100Gb links. 2 x 100Gb + 1 40Gb would be fine but not more than 240Gb in enabled links. 
 So the next model up would be the C8500-20x6C. This has 6 x 100Gb links which can all be enabled. However the caveat is that this is coming in at £250,000 which includes a £190,000 discount. Ouch! 
 Unfortunately I do have to stick with Cisco for this. We do have other DC's with Juniper but in this case it HAS to be Cisco. 
 I'm wondering if I should instead be looking at the ASR9000 range or if the price point of that is also going to be just as ridiculous? 
 To give an idea of what Juniper is charging for their MX204 which can handle 4 x 100Gb we were recently quoted £38,000 which includes the perpetual licensing.

So why was the Policy triggered, and the User blocked?
 This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, on 2 different MS Tenants.
 I've checked that no other policies are in effect.
 The user in question made a mail with more than a hundred Recipients and that mail had an empty Subject Line (yep!)
 Theory: Microsoft has an extra set of (not visible) policies that might trigger before the limits we have defined, is reached.
 Any other ideas?

 I have a requirement to host a SQL database for a mobile app. I've built a SQL server in our DMZ on a workgroup, not joined to the domain. I'm therefore using SQL logins.
 The main SQL server on our LAN has a one way connection LAN>DMZ to push certain tables into a new DB on the new DMZ SQL server.
 It's all working great, but I'm not sure how best to go about granting the app access.
 I've created a new SQL user on the database with read only access, is that right? I've noticed it's also appeared under security/users and I can use it to login with SSMS?
 Just want to ensure I'm doing the right thing here.
 Thanks!!

 Nothing advanced, just something very simple to say Engineer A and B will be doing 1-2-3 tomorrow at 12pm.
 They already Have M365 so i was thinking just use MS Planner.
 They only have 2 office workers who will be doing the project management and both have Business Premium.
 They will be doing the project managment for about 15 engineers, although non of them actually need to access planner or get any notifications.
 So my question is, can they use unlicensed users to add them into planner (More for a visual aid than anything else) or would they need to purchase a license of some sort?

 Edit: to avoid confusion, i'm talking about Tasks by Planner" integrated in Teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 We're using SSL certs on our (mainly microsoft) systems, currently at 400+ servers. We have a mix of internet registered wildcard, and local generated. The certs are for use with either web based systems, or some custom applications and RDP.
 At the moment this is a manual process and we really need some monitoring to email alert us in advance of expiry. An additional preference if possible is the tool to also allow us to renew the cert.
 Does anyone have any suggestions? 
 One requirement is we need to download and host the application internally. We don't host systems for external use so will not permit a web based SSL monitor (such as Dotcom-monitor) inbound access.
 Preferably a windows based app, but if it needs to run on Linux, I'm sure I can convice our manager that needs to happen. I've found one script on an MS site, but this requires plugins and scripitng knowledge, which I'm not familiar with, but could follow instructions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m the only sys-admin of a small but growing 25 person engineering company and I’m thinking about implementing a ticket system but I’m not sure if it’s beneficial.
 I only get two or three user problems per day but I don’t like how the users throw me out of my focus by chatting me up in Teams or calling me and expecting me to answer immediately just to fix the smallest of problems. The company is also trying to hire additional employees and I think it may be important to get another IT person soon. So all in all I do see a ticket system as an improvement.
 The problem is that my boss or anyone else in this company doesn’t know anything about IT and he doesn’t understand that I’m doing more than just fixing the users outlook problems because he just sees everything running fine and doesn’t know what goes into that. Because of that I fear that him seeing only a few support tickets coming in per day will lead him to believe that I don’t work enough. In reality I’m both trying to fix everything my predecessor implemented badly and without any documentation while keeping everything running and researching into improvements. But that can’t be put into tickets he can track.
 Would you recommend a full ticket system like Freshdesk in this situation? I thought about just creating a shared support mailbox instead so he at least doesn’t get statistics and I still get less distractions but maybe I’m better off with the status quo?

 I'm currently starting to plan migrating around 60 CentOS 8 Stream servers as they'll reach EOL next year. 
 I've done a test run with CentOS 9 Stream, but I've ran into quite a bit of problems that would require rather large changes to our "way of doing things". 
 I've looked into alternatives for CentOS Stream 8, and what first came to mind was Rocky Linux 8 and so far it looks promising - especially the EOL in 2029 - but I'm not sure if I want to commit to it. 
 Has anyone of you switched away from CentOS 8 Stream to Rocky Linux? If so, did you stumble upon something unexpected? Any other Distros you would recommend checking out? 
 Thanks for your time!

 So far all I've been doing is disabling background services like Google Drive one by one until it eventually stops, but there's a theory that it's our network shares or VPN causing it.
 It's only happening to one of the five computers we're currently testing on Win 11, so I'm half tempted to just format as well. But I'd rather figure out the real cause...

 We just recently updated our IT charter and wanted to know how other companys deal with users signing them.
 HR doesn't want to get involved in the process, not even during the hiring workflow. So obviously IT has to find a way.
 I thought about simply sending an email to all our users with the pdf attached accompanied with a "how to insert esignature on a document", but i feel the process will be too tedious for the users and obviously for the IT team especially on the storage of these documents.
 Do any of you guys use an electronic document management system, to store and provide pdf files so that authenticated users (through LDAP or AD) can digitally sign documents ?

 The plan is to migrate on-prem exchange to exchange online and decommission on-prem exchange after migration if possible. We also want to sync the user password hashes to MS365 and use our on-prem AD.
 Cutover migration is not an option for me cause of the 6 subsidiaries, so I think exchange hybrid is the way to go. I read many articles and MS pages but still having questions regarding minimal vs full hybrid: 
 - Why arent users manageable via on-prem ad using minimal hybrid? Is there a way to accomplish using minimal hybrid and on-prem ad and password sync? 
 - Why minimal hybrid should be used for a couple of weeks and not in long term? If all users are migrated, I dont have the problems with free/busy sharing and so on.
 - Modern vs classic auth, what to use?
 According to my current state of knowledge I would do the following.
 1: Change UPNs (.local domain)
 2: IDfix
 3: AAD connect
 4: Full hybrid
 5: Move mailboxes to MS365
 6: Install management exchange 2019
 7: Decommission exchange 2013 dag

 Switches are WS-C2960X-24TD-L running IOS 15.2(7)E4
 ​
 We are not getting any link lights or connections with the DAC cables, we have tried:
  
FS.com SFP+ Cable
 Aruba genuine SFP+ cable
 3rd Party "Cisco compatible" SFP+ cable
  
​
 We have tried all variations of different NIC ports, different Servers and switch ports.
 ​
 The below commands have been run on the Cisco to allow 3rd party DACs:
 service unsupported-transceiver
 and
 no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid
 ​
 I will update the post later with output from the switch CLI, but suffice to say we can't get a link, from the Server side all we can see is a "disconnected" state. We can't see any obvious licensing errors on the switches (its on "Lan base" from memory?)
 ​
 We also tried connecting a Windows DL380 Gen10 Server with different 10Gb NICs and this also didn't work.
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 Probably our next idea once we re-group is to install a loaner Aruba 10Gb switch and see if we can get Server connectivity to it.

 Let's start here: AV and EDR are not the same. Huntress is technically neither with their base product, their "Process Insights" product is an EDR, though. All these are the same class of thing (Endpoint Protection), but they all have very different design, and there's a fourth item - MDR/MTR. We'll go through these together.

 I recently started working for a school. All students use Windows devices. At the moment, there is no MDM or anti-virus other than Windows Defender. Due to the competitive education pricing, we are going to get EMS A3 licenses, which are equivalent to E3. This should give us the ability to manage the devices. I am wondering if we need to get an additional anti-virus or will we be able to see any vulnerabilities caught by Defender with EMS? I have little experience with this line of products so any advice would be appreciated.

 The current situation now - Hub is working with the Spokes but the Spokes to Spokes communication fails.
 From Cisco documentation:
 If one spoke is behind one NAT device and another different spoke is behind another NAT device, and Peer Address Translation (PAT) is the type of NAT used on both NAT devices, then a session initiated between the two spokes cannot be established. One example of a PAT configuration on a NAT interface is:

 Is there a workaround to rectify the issue and establish a session between the Spokes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rant time. So for those who don't know, they decided to get on the cloud train. The server version of popular products like Confluence and Jira are no longer to be sold and everyone has to join them in the cloud. Shouldn't be a problem, right? Both are server-driven products that are displayed in web browsers. I bet the interfaces are identical. 
 WRONG, SCRUB! They split the code bases and the products barely resemble each other. Whole layout and functionality is different. And boy do they know how to screw things up. 
 Like the multimedia macro? Tough luck. It's been removed from cloud. So if you, say, migrate a server site with videos to the cloud all your multimedia macros are broken. Ok, so how do you link the uploaded video on the page back to the page? See, if you had the multimedia macro you'd just put the macro on the page and select the video. 
 Well, what you do is you download the videos to your hard drive and then drag and drop them back to the site and then delete the duplicate videos that are now attached.
 Seriously? Did I get this wrong or is this the official answer coming from support? 
 Official answer. There's two feature requests related to fixing this feature gap, one is from 2018 and the other from 2019. 
 And that's how it goes. Plenty of feature requests out there and if you think anything's going to happen on them then I've got swampland in Florida to sell you. 
 This is an incredibly frustrating trend in software these days. They'll switch to a monthly payment model and just stop working on the product, content to milk the existing user base until they leave for sheer frustration.

I have a fleet of users with ubuntu linux laptops (ranges from 18.04 - 22.04) that have been on GlobalProtect for a while now. We included 6.0.4.something in our internal repo and installing the GP_UI package is part of our standard ubuntu image. LDAP auth on the backend because Palo/OpenConnect and SAML have been a moving disaster for years...
 Today, a huge uptick in users reporting that GP client is failing a FIPS initialization. No changes to the portal or gateways, and my environment is not FIPS. Windows clients are still fine, only linux users are getting the error as of today.
 The workaround is to remove and re-install the package, and is working for these users. I was wondering if anyone else with Palo Alto GlobalProtect has seen a notable increase in users with FIPS init failure errors.
 I have opened a case with Palo as well as collected user debug logs. But, because linux has never been a priority for Palo, I'm not holding my breath. This will probably turn in to a post about how PaloAlto should drop linux all together, but for now, I'd like to find out WHY? Did Ubuntu depreciate a SSL version that PanGP uses?

I went to my first AA meeting last Friday. It was a powerful experience. 
 I remember hearing people during the pandemic times say people are going to come out of this as a Hunk, a Chunk or a Drunk. I think I, unfortunately at in the 3rd group. 
 I am trying to work the program, but DAMN it is tough. Being someone in Technology, are there any resources that you guys/gals know about that can provide online help between those meetings?
 Are there any resources that people have used that can help people through this process
 thanks
 keep on, keeping on!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently had OSPF go down between an edge Palo Alto and a Cisco core switch. 
 No changes were made to either device as far as I can tell. Logs show no commits on the PA and no config changes to the Cisco switch (HA Pair)
 after some investigation I get:
  
ECHANGE to DOWN, Neighbor Down : Too many retransmission
  
found a few articles on both Cisco and PA side, both pointing to either MTU issue or Packet loss
  
Packet loss is unlikely: 1000 pings from OSPF interfaces 0% loss, <2ms average latency. They are directly connected
  
Some further debugging:
  
I can see the Adjacency process begin and the DBD packets transmit 
 I can see the VlXX OUT to the PA 
 I can see the VlXX IN from the PA 
 OUT packet len:1412 
 MTU on the router interface is 1500, verified by ping sweep 
 I can see the packets retransmit until they hit 25 where it is killed due to excessive retransmission 
 IN packets still come but are ignored for a timer until process repeats
  
So that size 1412 shouldn't get fragmented correct? 
 One other thing I noticed is that on the HA Pair, all the Vlan interfaces are setup HSRP, except the one facing the PAs. For whatever reason, those vlan interfaces are setup separate i.e. VlanXX x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2 with no standby... 
 oddly after the Neighbor exchange goes down, I see a new election between the two devices but using other HSRP Vlan interfaces, but over the OSPF VlanXX already in process. This setup seems really odd to me? Could it cause issues?
 It's been a while since I went really deep into OSPF troubleshooting so I'm at a little bit of a loss of where to go next. I can't find any other errors on the PA or Cisco devices other than the constant retransmission/kill loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: two man IT team tasked with rolling out network to multiple construction sites across the county. No fiber or copper connections available so reliant on LTE until these get put in towards the end of the constructions site's life. Hoping to achieve LTE router in a bridge/ modem mode to a UDM Pro downstream (business uses a Unifi network stack, affordable, standadized). 
 I am trying to get a Teltonika RUTXR1 to successfully bridge, or passthrough, it's WAN IP address to a UDM Pro. The Telonika has two SIM WAN interfaces (one EE, one O2), both interfaces are set to passthrough mode and the UDM Pro is set to DHCP for on it's WAN interface. 
 In bridge mode, the Teltonika is no longer accessible (as expected) however, the UDM Pro also does not get the WAN IP address and says that there is no internet connection.
 In passthrough mode the Teltonika is still accessible/ manageable through it's remote management system (as expected), the UDM Pro is adoptable onto the Unifi system and can be remotely managed. However, it's WAN IP address in the Unifi console is a private 192.168.1.x IP address and not the WAN IP the Teltonika has. Laptops connected to the UDM Pro also have no WAN connectivity even though the UDM can get firmware updates and be remotely managed.
 Where am I going wrong? Why does the UDM Pro have some connectivity in pass through mode but absolutely zero in bridge mode? 
 Is it CGNAT causing the issue? Is it a NAT or firewall issue on the Teltonika? The whitepapers state that all routing, NAT and firewall functionality are disabled in bridge mode (as expected) so, seems unlikely?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 For our non-revenue-generating R&D lab, we've been using the Cisco Small Business line of switches (SG350XG-24T, and SG550XG-24T) for 10GbT ToR switches. They have performed well for us over the years. Now I see that the Cisco Small Business (i.e., Linksys-heritage) line is now no longer being produced, and now it's the "Cisco Business" line for SME networking. Looks like the "Cisco Business 350-24XT Managed Switch" would be the closest model as compared to what we've bought in the past; I have a few questions...
 1) Is the NOS closer to Cisco IOS than the CSB line was (that was "IOS-like" but had quite a few different commands, etc.) 2) There's no "DNA" license BS with this line? 3) Are there other good choices for a 24-port 10GbT switches out there? We have been swinging our switching over to Juniper, but they don't have a good/lower-cost 24-ports of 10GbT model out there from what I can tell... 
 (And also, I know 10GbT is kind of a legacy port type vs SFP+, but that's what all their servers have in the location we're buying for, and what the admin staff there knows...)
 Thanks!

However, none of the links are in role "Root", and all other switches in the network have their root port going toward this Nexus 9k. There are no VDCs running on this Nexus 9k.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started a new job as a junior tech hoping to join a more mature network and IT group. To my surprise, the network is a bit of a mess and it seems like network design best practices were not followed at all. There's also lack of documentation.
 One thing that's really confused me is the way Switch to Switch connections were done. The network tech created seperate VLANs for each switch to switch connection, configured the ports as access ports, and then tagged the vlan. As a result, there are 299 VLANs with most only being used for 2 ports. 
 ​
 For example -
 Switch A -
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/3
 switchport access vlan 614
 ​
 interface Vlan614
 description NCH-3
 ip address 10.2.254.46 255.255.255.252
 ip pim sparse-dense-mode
 ​
 VLAN Name Status Ports
 ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
 614 NCH3-NCH1 active Te1/3
 ​
 Switch B -
 interface GigabitEthernet1/1/1
 switchport access vlan 614
 ​
 interface Vlan614
 ip address 10.2.254.45 255.255.255.252
 ip pim sparse-dense-mode
 ​
 VLAN Name Status Ports
 ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
 614 NCH3-NCH1 active Gi1/1/1, Gi1/1/3, Gi1/1/4, Te1/1/1, Te1/1/2
 ​
 I'm a junior tech so this has really confused me. I always thought that you want switch to switch connections configured as Trunk. What would be the best way to correct something like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7(?) years into my career and I've finally reached the point of burn out. My previous role nearly reached the same point, but I left before I got to that.
 It's been brewing in me for some months now, managed to get a pay rise in the summer (but IT pay in the UK is dogshit anyway). The userbase we support is increasing, but we're horrendously understaffed, no time to research new technologies, we're locked in with garbage fucking systems because somehow it's not our decision. Somehow spend more time doing what should be a dedicated first line support's job, instead of doing actual system infrastructure maintenance. Sales guy is letting small clients set up BYOD systems and then trying to impose lockdowns on their personal devices, including using Intune/Endpoint Manager with a bunch of fucking Macbooks, then coming to me for help (spoiler: I can't)
 But yesterday, I had the full blown meltdown. Simple task, user needs printer/scanner installing. It's an older HP so probably won't be too much of a bastard to sort. Log on, no admin access for some reason, looks like Intune hadn't been applying the settings, and of course, Intune gives 0 useful information as to why. So it's possible the user is still an admin. Try to get him to elevate, he's not doing it and keeps cancelling, then he brings up HP Smart and disappears for 20 minutes and I get disconnected. Later get an email saying "all working, thanks"
 Just lost it. Why is such a simple task such a twat to do? Why is our IT structure so broken?
 Good people to work for, just not a good company
 Had an interview today, big pay rise, decent looking company. Stage 1 of 3 complete, finger's crossed I make it to the end (I won't!)
 Thanks for attending my rant, how's your week going?

 As per title, I'm interested to hear your recommendations for Sysadmin books, what I'm interested in particular is understanding the concepts that lead to a decision when it comes to designing systems and better understand how I can streamline and improve certain organizational aspects of our company and better align IT goals with the goals of the business.
 I'm not sure if what I wrote is clear enough.

I know type-2 route is MAC or MAC+IP, my question is what does it mean if a type-2 route has MAC AND IP vs if it only has MAC? Say , a leaf got an ARP packet from an endpoint and wants to advertise over BGP EVPN session to other leafs (via spine), how does it know whether to add the IP or not in that advertisement? I know, the wireshark trace shows type-2 and label[0] and label[1] but still wasn't clear on this. thanks

 My curiosity gets the best of me so I safely open the .xlsm and this is on the front sheet:

There are lots of usb 2.5gb adapters on the market now, lots of manufactures but I'm finding most of them use the realtek chipset ( RTL8156, RTL8153, RTL8152B etc ). I tried 2 separate brands using the realtek chipaet, not super impressed with their performance. 
 Can you guys suggest one that is reliable and maybe uses USB 3.1 or 3.2? The realtek ones seem to drop packets randomly while doing some iperf tests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While changing internet providers we are left with the responsibility of sorting out our own phone line. As landlines are becoming obsolete, we are looking into VoIP. We assumed it would be as cheap or cheaper than landlines since everything is online and we buy our equipment.
 We only need one number, and several headsets that work in a hierarchy where all incoming calls are going into one office with the option of directing the calls to the other headsets (if someone is trying to reach a certain room).
 All the VoIP providers are saying that we need individual users for each DECT phone, to be able to transfer between them and to be able to make phone calls. We will need 7 headsets, and what is worse, 7 users taking us to quite a monthly tariff considering that we are not using more than 200 minutes/month.
 At this point, if anyone has an idea of how to set this up without advanced setup knowledge, that would be amazing. I am also happy to jump on a quick call, for a little paid consultancy.
 I've made a diagram of the setup I was thinking to get for the business which can be seen here.
 Any help is much appreciated!

And then they litterely starting to google random shit and add it to a post i did on our intranet explaining me what to do for cybersecurity. Like litterly telling me how to do my job haha.
 Context: We just did a phishing campaign run, which in our eyes was an obvious phish and 21% of the corrensponents clicked on the link of which 9% added sensitive information in a form and clicked on send. You can say that cybersecurity awareness is not a hot topic in our company which we are trying to address trough management and policy (which is going great by the way).
 Sometimes shit like this gets under your skin when people start to complain that massively shit can get to you. Which it now does.
 How do you handle these kinds of situations? What do you tell yourself, mentally?
 ​
 p.s.On friday my manager is going to share the details of the phish, and is going to say that "most" of the people that are now commenting on this implementation where also the persons that have clicked on the link in the e-mail. In Holland we call it "met gestrekte been erin" and in english that would be " With straight leg in it"

 last time we had a case in the company that someone was sending spam from our user's account. It was probably a trojan or someone had cracked the user's password. We know how to protect ourself against trojans and password cracking, but sometimes these situations can happen due to user carelessness. 
 What security measures do you have in place, on the antispam firewall or perhaps on Exchange, to prevent you from sending spam from your network and being blacklisted?
 I would just like to add: Sometimes our users need to send an email to more than 1000 recipients.
 Thank you very much in advance.

Due to security reasons, the plants terminal is not connected to the web. The terminal instead generates a .csv report which is then shared in a shared folder.
 The plants syso wasn't much of a help in determining how everything works there. He sent me this URI that opened a shared folder in my work laptop win 11 machine
 \\hcldata1\hcs_fldr$\45-SOME-MANUFACURING-DATA 
 This opened a folder on my machine. Now, this is very confusing to me as I am a programmer and I don't use Windows that much. Who serves this folder? Is this OneDrive (i was told no)? Azure? How did I access something not on my PC without a proper URL/URI? Sorry if those questions seem basic. I am just a Linux guy so I am unfamiliar with enterprises that run on Windows products.
 P.S: Also I need to know how I automate a process that sends reports added to that folder to a remote web server written in Node. Not a tutorial, but more of a general direction. Like, do I install WSL and write a bash script? Or do I write a powershell script? Just a direction.

 I pitched a roadmap/development plan for the junior analysts which would involve them managing the IT assets and working alongside the 2nd line team.

 My salary currently sits at £42k ($50k) and while an increase in salary would be helpful I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot here and come across as greedy.

 1.I have a dlink home router it's ip is 192.168.0.1. its dhcp range is 192.168.0.50 to 192.168.0.100.
 i want to extend the router wifi range and ethernet ports. 
 So I have another linksys router of ip 192.168.1.1.
 I want to connect linksys router with dlink to extend wifi range and ethernet using lan cable. 
 How to do it? 
 My instructor said to connect one lan port of dlink router with the wan port on linksys router through a lan cable and turn off dhcp on linksys router. 
 So you will get internet through linksys router. Is he right? 
 Then what about the ip adress conflict between both router. One is 192.168.0.1 and other is 192.168.1.1
 Both are on Different network. Does it works? 
 As per my assumption every device connected to router through the wired or wirelessly to the router should be on same network. 
 If it works how to acess second router configaration page.? 
 Because if we connect second router to the first router,dhcp server of first router changes the second router ip. 
 Then how to know the ip of second router? 
 2.Also I have tenda router. I want to connect it to dlink router through wirelessly. 
 It has a seperate wireless repeating option on configuration page. 
 On that menu there is 3 option 1.wisp 2.universal repeater 3.ap mode. 
 Which one should I choose? 
 Also tell me the remaining changes I should do on tenda router? 
 3.does all router have wireless repeatet option? 
 If don't then is any other way to connect second router to primary router wirelessly? 
 4.if we purchase a router for extension how to know it has all the function necessary for router extension?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've altered some information below and made it generic so as to be less recognizable.
 I was in a technology meeting where Really Bad Idea™ was proposed. At the time, I told them such and normally my opinions have weight, but this time I was outnumbered and they were locked in. Another in my cohort at this meeting, we will call him Mr. Z, is the kind of person who gleefully runs and does whatever upper management asks. He was as much for it as I was against it. So this thing got legs and ran.
 It's my role to sell some of these upper management decisions to the group, and do what was needed to make them successful. This time that wasn't possible. It was too draconian. It directly impacted people and their time. All I could do was offer some help. But I presented it as neutrally as possible so as not to throw anyone under the bus because it's just never good to openly do so. As a result they thought I initiated it, which normally I live with but this time was different.
 When the complaints from the field started coming in, people didn't want to say anything to me directly so they went to Mr. Z much to my surprise. Mr. Z then didn't own up to the fact that he was a big part of why this idea went forward. He just quietly listened, sympathized, and then went about his day. I know this because I overheard one of these conversations.
 At that point I called a WebEx with everyone in the field, apologized for the nightmare and the impact it had, and gathered data with all of their feedback on the recent issue. Everyone was 100% against it and all of the suggestions to fix it aligned. I then presented that data to upper management and requested to make modifications to the idea so it could work. It was more work to fix it but it needed to be fixed with urgency.
 This crisis was averted, but it cost valuable time and had an impact on my street cred. It sucked.

 I have problem with native VPN in both Windows 10 / 11 on domain computers (with roaming profiles enabled).
 After I create (manually) new VPN connection (in new Windows 10/11 Settings panel) I cannot connect to it, because it throws The system could not find the phone book entry for this connection error everytime.
 Funny thing, when I run old rasphone client, then I can connect to it without issue.
 I've even tried to remove rasphone.pbk file in user roaming profile (on server), but it doesn't help. It only works when I copy it from roaming profile into C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Connections\Pbk\... but when I create another VPN profile, then I have to copy it to ProgramData too, because new connection doesn't work...
 Is there a way to force the new Windows 10/11 VPN panel to use rasphone.pbk file from roaming profile, and not the C:\ProgramData one?

What advantages are there for one over the other? To my understanding the difference is that dual cloud will keep the spoke tunnel up in the event of a failed hub, whereas with NHS clustering there would be a momentary lose in transport as NHRP transitions from the primary tunnel to the secondary.

 The part I’m actually having trouble with? 
 I’ve been working on a script to re-do the user Outlook profile and completely log them out of office and teams and work/school account, saved credentials etc.
 Outlook works fine since I can pipe 2 registry keys for a new profile and then make it default on the next launch. They then get logged in with seamless sso 
 Basically a reset without nuking the actual profile.
 Normally we would use our vendor tool to help the users get logged in to the “new” accounts but of course this is a VDI environment and it doesn’t play nicely.
 I can’t get teams/OneDrive to log out seemingly No matter what I do to the registry or folders there in.
 I did see some scripts online but they don’t actually work lol.

 I have a group policy on my current AD setup that updates the following registries for Windows 10, but it doesn't seem to be the same case for Windows 11.
 Registry 1:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PersonalizationCSP Value name: LockScreenImageStatus 
 Registry 2:

 Registry 3:

 The above registries work successfully on Windows 10. But I have no idea how to accomplish the same task on Windows 11.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 With that said, I need to survey Wi-Fi at about 5-7 medium-sized buildings (20-55k sq. ft.) and install some access points (or in some cases potentially hire someone else to install an entire new system), then show some of the higher-ups the before and after Wi-Fi surveys of the site.
 I've been reading up on this, and it seems like AirMagnet and Ekahau are the popular ones, but dang are they expensive. At one building with 3 floors and 17 access points, it costed us around $2500 for parts and labor on a mesh Wi-Fi system, so we can't really justify the same amount or more for just surveying from our perspective.
 For this type of work/scenario, would Netspot Pro be fine?
 Let me know if clarification is needed, or if I am just way off here.
 ​
 Bonus:
 I would love to learn more about setting up business/enterprise-level Wi-Fi systems, what would be a good way for me to learn more? Like I see the backside of patch panels and it looks crazy, but it makes me very interested.

 I've been in the MSP/helpdesk space for 3 years now as a level 2.5/3 engineer. I'm getting tired of the sweat shop that are MSPs and want to move into a sys admin role. I've been applying around and have not found much success in even getting into the door for interviews. 
 I've got:
 an associates in computer science
 5 years of total IT work experience (3 working as a higher level engineer)
 - experience with various flavors of win servers, firewalls, and more 3rd party softwares then i can count
 I don't know if I'm looking in the wrong area or if I am just not qualified but I'm finding little success in my job hunt. Any advise would be appreciated!

 We are testing options to have users logging with some sort of MFA into their machines. 
 Great, get Windows hello for business going, applied to some test machines : fantastic! Face id + pin! yea!
 Then we figure out we can simply login with user/pass, and there is not way to enable mfa. Why? what's the point of even implementing Windows hello for business if you can't enforce mfa on user/passwords?
 Then ok, phew... we can hide the login with username/password button but...you can't use runas / rdp etc..
 so what is the effing point? Can someone explain me the logic of this?

 Seeking advice on handling a growing concern in our organisation regarding cyber security for our board members. They frequently access sensitive information on their personal devices, and their skill level is very worrying. We've recently identified them as the weakest link in our organisation due to the mix of BYO PCs and Macs.
 Has anyone else faced a similar issue? If so, what steps did you take to mitigate the risk and ensure the security of your data?
 Considerations thus far include making 365 read-only when accessed in a browser. We've ruled out supplying a separate device for our organisation as they sit on multiple boards.
 We are considering Netspoke for our org but only in the early stages of this discussion. Could this assist.
 Any suggestions or best practices would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.

 Explanation: I've worked in smaller environments ever since I started in IT 8 years ago. I've worked on a lot of different things but not necessarily deep into a single thing. If I need to know more about something I can read documentation and/or use Google and solve the issue. The problem is this doesn't seem to be cutting it. Companies want me to know things off the top of my head without doing research. Or some things I am confident I would be able to learn/pick up on fairly quickly. Some of this is my poor interviewing skills which I am working on. For example I interviewed for a Tech specialist 3/Jr Sys Admin roll and the feedback I got at the end of the interview was that they thought I had the skills of a level 1 tech. 
 So I guess my question is what have you guys done to build your "jack of all trades" job history into something that works at a larger company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still new to the role, so I'm uncertain about the best practices for this. Apparently, this Small school has to have an internal DNS server to direct them to our website using the internal IP's. This is for all the students and everyone in every subnet. And I asked why they just don't use the public IP if it's accessible. Well, the answer was simple. You cannot access any of the internal websites from the inside using the public IP address. I thought that was strange. 
 I did a basic traceroute to the website and yep, it stops on our Palo Alto firewall. It's due to an Age out/incomplete which I'm sure is due to the Virtual router in the firewall not knowing where to send the traffic. 
 However, I'm not sure how this should be done. 
 Do I just implement a routing rule that anyone coming to the firewall internally asks for the public IP address of our website to redirect them back through the same interface? 
 Baically the Default Gateway from the Core Switch has 1 interface connected to the Palo as the next hop that connects that interface to the router, then that router has a next hop for all traffic to our actual router. 
 So 
 Core Switch 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 Palo Alto Vr Router -PublicIP interface. 1 -> Public IP interface Physical Router -> The internet. 
 To be clear yes the Firewall has an interface with a public IP address that we own that hops to the router with also a Public IP address that we own and then to the internet.

 We are slowing trying to move everything off of ESXi and on to Hyper-V
 Going to use the MS storage migration service. About 2.5TB 
 Right now the drive holding all of the data is on a virtual disk added to the VM via ESXi.
 My question.
 Is it best to just add a virtual disk on the new server in Hyper-V and copying all the data there?
 Or is there any benefit of connecting the new storage volume via iSCSI to the new server and then copying all the data there? 
 Only benefit I can think of is that if the file server had an issue we can In theory connect the drive to another server via iSCSI.
 However I know I can just mount the virtual disk to another server via Hyper-V
 Little background on the environment, have a Hyper-V cluster going with a clusters storage via a Nimble SAN.
 I am also planning a doing a replication of the server to a offsite location using Veeam.
 Thank you all in advance for your input please comment if I am maybe not going at this the right way or if there is a better way too got to accomplish this.

From what I’m finding the 802.11s protocol is simply the protocol for an ESS mesh network so I feel like I’m going in circles trying to compare something to itself.

 How would hosts from Subnet A handle an ARP announcement regarding a host from Subnet B?
 Longer question: 
 We are trying to setup a VPN server on our servers subnet, 10.1.4.0. We randomly decided an IP range that the server would hand out to clients, 10.1.16.0. When a client connects to the server, the server sends out an ARP announcement saying that it's MAC address has said client with a 10.1.16.x address. But when I look at the server's gateway (a Firepower) and other hosts on the subnet, the ARP tables aren't storing/saving hosts with 10.1.6.x IPs. Is that expected behavior? I know that ARP packets don't usually cross subnet boundaries, but this seems like a unique situation so I figured I'd ask you smart folks. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am curious to know what do you think about TLS Inspection. I have seen companies from aggressively forcing everything from every client through their firewall to "The clients have endpoint protection and that is enough".
 But as I am also involved in the network design in our company I am curious to know what real world experiences look like. Googleing often gives you just a comparison table and a summary but never very specific and often just scratching the surface. So what experiences and opinions do you have about it and where do you see strengths and weaknesses in your network? Has it actively helped against malware or was it a weakness (for example due to weak root cert protection).
 Thank you for your answer in advance and have a lovely day. So let me end with the word: Fight! 😉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I posted asking about getting xconnect over MPLS running between two routers, and was shown how to do a QinQ tunnel and that was great. Now I'm trying to get VPLS to run multipoint between three routers.
 The issue I'm running into is everything I'm reading has me creating a VFI in manual configuration mode. But I don't have that option...when I go to issue the command the only choice is point-to-point. If I try to re-issue the command the help menu will then SAY that manual is an option, but if I try it I get told the name is already in use.
 The other issue has to do with the xconnect command on the interface. The docs I'm reading have you issue the xconnect name with the VFI, and that's also not an option: The only option is the IP of the neigbor. Maybe if I configure the VFI manually and actually get the "vpn id" option into the VFI it'll allow me to attach it with xconnect? But I can't figure out what I'm missing.
 This is on 3800 routers. I've tried different code and always get the same options. Am I missing something that turns these features on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previous thread
 When last I posted here on the topic, prior to the Christmas break, I was being pressured into shunting all of my IT stuff into a broom closet. My direct supervisor is the 2nd in command for the whole school system, and he became more and more furious over this request as I brought it up to him over our break. He clearly is on my side in this, which means case closed, it's not happening. 
 I've chatted up the admin at the high school since on numerous occasions, and it has never once come up in conversation. Having 6 carts full of laptops charging in the room every day has helped, as there would be no space at all for this stuff. Between that, a laminator, a sound system for our gym, and countless spare machines, it would be impossible to fit all that stuff into their proposed "space", never mind trying to cram a pair of bodies in there with our desks to boot. 
 All in all, I wanted to update everyone to let you all know that it worked, and that I am still master of my domain (puns for days). I know my employees appreciate my hard line I took in this matter, but I also wanted to thank all of you for supporting my choices in this matter. It's one of my highest rated posts on here, and I got a lot of great feedback from members of this sub. IT people deserve better than the crap we get from most people, and all the IT folks I talk to, even in conversations today, agree with me. We are not often treated with respect and dignity, but I'm not going to let that happen on my watch, with my staff, for as long as I am employed here. 
 So thanks again, and feel free to comment or message me any questions you might have about working on a First Nations reserve, or in a FN school. I know my living and working situation is unique, so don't be shy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 This question is regarding stacking/ uplinks. 
 We're planning a new location setup. This will be my first time doing a configuration like this solo as our engineer is no longer with us, I appreciate any help/advice 
 We run a two-tier hierarchy design. We'll have 1 Core switch along with a 5 stack for access switches. This will be for a small(ish) branch location, so not looking to go all out. 
 What would be the best way to uplink the access stack to the Core? 
 Looking though what our old engineer did, he would use the first two ports on the stack commander to use as uplinks to the Core.
 Would that be the best option, or do we have a point of failure if that stack commander goes down? 
 I'm thinking of using 1 port ( or two?) from each switch in the stack to use as an uplink to the Core. Is this silly/over kill? Planning on configuring them all into 1 LAG. ( ex. 1/1/1, 2/1/1, 3/1/1, etc. into LAG ID 1).
 Also, they're looking at getting a 24 port core opposed to a 48. Technically, if I use 1 port on each switch for uplinks I should only need ~16 ports, ~20 if if I go with two per switch. 
 Is there something I'm not thinking of that could cause issues down the line? Our current Core's are all 48 ports, though the old admin would use the extra ports as Access, which I do not plan on doing.

Would it make sense to use Cloudflare (or some provider) as an authoritative DNS and then use a self-hosted recursive DNS within our network? 
 Or should we host our own authoritative and recursive DNS servers?
 Or should we use a recursive DNS server provided by someone like Cloudflare?
  
Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

 I was in middle school when this poor lady started having a problem, and she's just now submitting a ticket.
 The log entries number in the thousands
 Happy Monday everyone.
 Edit: Adding context here since this is blowing up.
 The user is logging into an application that we host on a remote server, the database which is being used has data from as far back as 1999. The application itself still gets updates to this day. Even when deleted the alert still remains
 Edit 2: We normally would clear this thing out with a script. Problem is ours doesn't work for something this large so we've had to contact the vendor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i've been battling Microsoft Teams for the past months, most of the time the Addin have not been added automatically, but for the last week i've been battling a plugin which is showing as Active, however none of the functions actually shows up or works (Share on Teams is the only button that shows up but does nothing) 
 So today i sat down to investigate, and i figured out that the culprit is the MicrosoftTeamsAddin version, however no search results shows any of these issues..
 But i've replicated the issue on 3 WVD Enviroments.
 MicrosoftTeamsAddin Versions 
  
1.0.22321.3 - borked
 
1.0.22304.2 - borked
 
1.0.22272.2 - borked
 
1.0.22234.1 - borked
 
1.0.22209.4 - borked
 
1.0.22147.1 - ok
 
1.0.20091.2 - ok
 
1.0.19296.2 - ok
 
 Teams Versions 
  
1.6.0.376 - borked - 2 February 2023
 
1.5.0.33362 - borked - 14 December 2022
 
1.5.0.31168 - borked - 2 November 2022
 
1.5.0.28361 - borked - 20 October 2022
 
1.5.0.21668 - borked (1.0.22209.4) - 31 August 2022
 
1.5.0.21463 - ok (1.0.22147.1) - 11 August 2022
 
1.5.0.17656 - ok (1.0.22147.1) - 06 July 2022
 
 Teams is installed with ALLUSER=1 and IsWVDEnviroment set to 1 in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Teams 
 I can also confirm the issue is not present when installed as Current user, atleast not on a normal client. 
 So my question is, have any of you encountered this issue AND resolved it? And can you replicate it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are looking at ways to try to reduce the attack surface of on our LAN. To that end, we currently have communication between client workstations blocked so they can only communicate with servers.
 We've tried to go further by even reducing that to only necessary services. For example, we've blocked client workstations from communication with servers via SMB ports 139 and 445 (obviously with a few exceptions such as our file server and Domain Controller).
 Now, running our last port scan, I see we still have port 135 open from workstations to servers. Can I safely block that?
 My understanding is it is used for RPC and remote management. Ideally what I am trying to set up is to block all remote management like RDP, WinRM, etc to my servers from ordinary client workstations and only allow it from a bastion host.
 I know you should not block it between servers like DCs because that will break replication. But what about blocking it from client workstations? Is that safe to do?
 Thanks!

I've met people along the way who've had roles where they would spend x amount of weeks based on a location internationally. I think typically it's a month on, and then a month off. Testing my memory I think they were remote military locations, or in the Oil industry.
 I was given a couple of recruitment agency details and did inquire a few years back, but ive since long forgotten who they were and for the life of me I can't find them on a Google search.
 Has anyone done this kind of work?

 The results: https://imgur.com/a/LlazOTr
 I don't have much experience with storage, but 100MB/s seq write seems kind of slow, especially for SSD? I understand that we bought entry level storage, but shouldn't it able to outperform our 6 year old storage with HDD disks?
 The new storage is configured with raid 6, compression and deduplication, connected with FC. When testing storage speed without compression and deduplication the results are little bit better, but it doesn't max out CPU in any case.

 I would like to receive as many spam emails as possible in order to gain knowledge from them. I.e. I set up a website where email addresses are placed, spread them on social media, on Github, etc., just to name a few examples, so they get scraped. I've also subscribed to shady newsletters, but without clicking the confirmation link. However, I have had only moderate success with this.
 Ultimately, it's exactly the opposite of what you'd normally want: to not be on the spammers' radar. I want to be right on the spammers' radar and on their mailing lists.
 Do you have any suggestions, further ideas on what to try to get spammers to acquire my email addresses and send spam there as well.

 I need your advice. 
 I want to externalise some networking tasks to a Help Desk. I want them to perform basic troubleshooting before forwarding a network-related ticket to my support group. 
 Our network is fully cloud-based. So, there won't be a CLI involved. I was thinking to create one generic account, linked with the Help Desk support group email, with ReadOnly rights to be used by all ~60 members of the Help Desk. 
 Some of my colleagues suggested that there is a security & privacy issue with this approach and that I should create personal accounts for all Help Desk operators linked to their work emails. 
 Do you see any security issues with this or not? 
 Thank you in advance!

 We are pretty overwhelmed at the moment and I wanted to see what others though as we seem to be a bit of a different demographic composition. We do self-checkout devices. There is about 1000 locations total and the majority of these are sitting on your standard household type internet circuits. Inexpensive Fiber (FiOS, uVserve, cable internet, cellular routers, and even some DSL (Yes, DSL!). We do have maybe 300 locations that are either on business fiber, or the location we are at provide us internet.
 User base though is only about 500 and a lot of the "is your cable plugged in", "did you reboot your 8-port switch under your desk" is handled by our "Desktop Support team".
 We are also installing 3-7 new locations a week and the network team has to handle getting the internet solution in place as well.
 Our network team is a whopping 3x people. I feel like we need at least 6x. anyone in a similar setup. ?These three people are also responsible for the datacenter networking, our HQ facility, but not VoIP (other than setting up VLANs for phones)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, looking for something that will help accomplish the following without being cumbersome to administrate- it's a large organisation and needs change regularly.
 Require a system that will serve a responsive dynamic intranet homepage, with links and menu items for different audiences within the organisation.
 The ability to create and easily manage templates of different link sets for AD user groups (and combinations of groups if possible). We have Azure AD.
 Allows panels to be embedded, serving other pages from our domain eg. KPI info, outstanding tasks etc.
 Bonus points if it already has MS integrations eg. Email, calendar, but not essential.
 Maybe I'm searching the wrong terminology but I'm not finding a turnkey solution for what I've got in mind which I find surprising.
 We have SharePoint but not a fan of the general look & feel so something that builds on this may suffice, but managing SharePoint list items for the different audiences isn't my preferred route for this.
 Welcome your experiences and recommendations.

 First, it’s my understanding that Active Directory provides directory and account permissions management. Is this correct?
 Secondly, as I understand it, both do the same thing except that Azure AD is hosted the cloud while on-prem AD is hosted on a local server. Is this correct?
 Can someone explain the main differences between these?

 I was wondering if the same protocols used for lower speed connections are as efficient and properly designed for use in higher speed connections. What protocols are best? 
 Also, are communication protocols embedded into the hardware architecture or can we just define our own protocols and test them out? 
 Thanks. Any help or slap towards the right directions is appreciated.

I'll call these AD.foo.bar and BD.foo.bar When users are created they are created in the AD domain. For reasons we want to mange our environment with a different domain. We created the domain BD and a two way trust between them. In the BD domain I can create groups, add users from AD to these groups, authenticate computer logins, most of the things I would expect to be able to do. However we have a couple web applications that can do authentication from Active Directory which want a base DN for users and groups. This is where I run into the problem. The base DN for users something like OU=company,DC=AD,DC=foo,DC=bar While the DN for users is OU=company,DC=BD,DC=foo,DC=bar
 My question, is there a good way around this kind of problem? Is it worth trying to copy users between domains or is there something here that I might totally be missing?

 I ran into a problem which may cause some serious privacy issues, and i havent found any solutions on the internet.
 The problem is as follows, we have a user, he opens the office365 outlook app and checks the inbox of a shared mailbox.
 After checking, he presses on a new email as he decides to mail a client of ours, types the email etc and as last step he goes to the options field and checks the from adres, it shows his personal work email. He sends the mail to our client.
 However, now the mail he has send is showing up in the shared mailbox sent items. Every user can now read the mail in send items. It shows the personal from adres from our user. For me this is 100% reproducible, as i take the same steps. I would expect the reciever to get the mail as send on behalf of the shared mailbox, but to the reciever it shows as a mail recieved by the personal mailbox. The header of the mail also has no sign what so ever from the shared mailbox. 
 Now this is kinda a red flag, as this would mean that user in our organisation might think he is typing a private message to someone else, only to show up in the sent items of the shared mailbox..
 What am I missing? Sorry in advance if it's a bit jibbrish or bad gramma , I will edit the post to clarify or edit Grammer if needs be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We plan to upgrade our File Server Failover Cluster from Server 2016 to Server 2019. It consists of 2 Nodes, Functional Level is 2016. 
 I read these 2 articles:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/upgrade-option-same-hardware
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/cluster-operating-system-rolling-upgrade
 From my understanding, it's possible to upgrade without any downtime?
 Like this?: Pause cluster, drain, evict, reformat, and install Server 2019 on one node. Add this node to the cluster and run it in Mixed-OS mode. Then do the same on the other node and lastly run "Update-ClusterFunctionalLevel". 
 But is that really the most efficient way to do it?
 In the first linked article "Upgrading Failover Clusters on the same hardware" in the overview part it is written:
  
Upgrading the operating system on an existing failover cluster is only supported when going from Windows Server 2016 to Windows 2019. If the failover cluster is running an earlier version, such as Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier, upgrading while the cluster services are running will not allow joining nodes together. 
  
So what does this mean? It's not explained further...
 Lastly, in-place upgrade or new installation?
 Any input is welcome (:

 ATM we are enable more logs on Active Directory. Now the Security Log Protocol on our domain controller fills up quite fast. About 500k events per day. The problem is, that the domain controller become unresponsive some times. 
 How do you deal with this problem? Of course i could raise the cpu and ram on the virutal dc, but it seams that the eventlog services is single threaded. 
 We are using the elastic stack and nxlog as log shipper.

 Anyone has experience dealing with error similar to the below?
 ​
 ERROR 2 (0x00000002) Copying NTFS Security to Destination File \\filesvr\file.txt
 The system cannot find the file specified.
 Below is the robocopy command that I use.
 ROBOCOPY \\bgr-fp01\f$\data\ G:\data\ /MIR /Sec /SECFIX /XA:SH /XJD /copy:DATSOU /MT:64 /R:1 /W:5 /LOG:%LOG%
 ​
 When taking a look at the above example file, I do not have permission to view the folder/files nor I can see what NTFS/Shared permissions that are set.
 If I take ownership of the folder/subfolder/files, and provide myself full permission to the folder/files, then I won't get the above ERROR 2...
 ​
 There are a lot of the above errors shown in the robocopy log as there are quite a large amount of data to be copied to new file server. Does it mean that I have to take ownership of the top folder including any sub folder/file and gave myself permission to all these files in order to avoid the above error? 
 ​
 Is there another way to do this? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

 Quick and easy from a random conversation today with a client/IT Tech who asked why this is not possible; 
 Client/IT - Purchased a lot of Windows 10 HOME devices (dont ask why)
 Client/IT has staff using E3 and E5 licenses
 Client/IT wants to purchase a single Windows 10 Pro license and use it to upgrade all HOME devices to PRO and then join the device to Azure to make it change from Pro to Enterprise using the single key from before.
 Is this remotely possible and even allowed or they talking hyperbole BS to me ? 
 Note, we do some of their MSP but they have their own inhouse IT who do more comms, radios, rock breaking and digging stuff and its their environment, we just help them out from time to time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a collection of rack mount UPS systems after various company changes at a client. The batteries all went out of date during the pandemic and office shutdown while in conditioned storage. I'm looking to buy a pile of batteries to deal with the new office setup. I haven't bought these in 5 or 6 years. So I'll ask.
 The Duracell battery that I need is:
 SLA12-8F Duracell Ultra 12V 8AH AGM SLA Battery with F1 Terminals
 I bought 4 of these "down the street" just to test out the units. All work fine. But at $45 or so each, ouch.
 So, what brand of battery do the networking folks like to buy when they age out of the UPS systems?
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening,
 A few months ago, I replaced a bunch of Catalyst 2960S switches in our environment with new Cisco 9200L series switches. The swapover went well in general, but recently our users have started complaining about intermittent VOIP quality issues. I'm assuming a simple QoS policy will resolve the issue, but I'm having some issues understanding how I should go about it.
 We have two switch stacks. Three switches in a stack in one building with our ISP routers, two switches in a stack in our other building. A 10G fiber uplink connects the switch stacks between buildings.
 We have a VOIP Vlan set to Vlan 100. Most user access ports have both the VOIP Vlan and general data VLAN (200) configured. Ex:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3 switchport access vlan 200 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 100 spanning-tree portfast 
 Our phones are older Polycom devices, not Cisco.
 I've read up on Cisco Auto QoS, but I've also read it's not the most efficient way of implementing QoS. Especially in an environment that isn't using Cisco phones. I started a support case with Cisco, but they just sent me the Auto QoS documentation I already have...
 Can anyone help me understand what should be done here? Is there a way I can just tell the switch "prioritize anything on Vlan 100"? What about the uplink between switches? 
 Thanks!

 For context, I’m a networking grad in Canada that was hired at a big bank on the network provisioning/management team (which I think is a tier/level above the NOC), and so I’m wondering if I’m missing out on valuable networking experience not starting in a NOC.
 I do have my CCNA and I can confidently say I know the fundamentals, but will it be a big hindrance that I didn’t start out in a NOC. Or will working on my current team expose me eventually to the common and fundamentals of enterprise networking through implementing changes/sitting in on meeting, etc.
 Would also love to hear from those who have not worked in a NOC and how your career has gone.

I do TV installing and other entry level tech needs but I have a client who needs a new TV that works at a university that uses WPA2 enterprise I believe. You select the wifi network and it requires a username and a password. 
 From what I was reading is it any device that supports 802.11 and up supported but I could very well be wrong. They are needing a new TV and would like to connect it for smart features.

 Our current CISO area is consistently shooting other IT software requests in the foot. We have a current workflow where they are approving/disapproving software for use within our company, however recently they have denied things that would be free or alternatives to SnagIt (think ShareX or Greenshot), KeePass (they suggested LastPass Enterprise), as well as denied VLC with no available suitable replacement.
 Our IT teams are 100% impacted by these disapprovals and the CISO team are not keeping our asset mgmt team in mind, nor our users in mind. I'm currently not in a full sysadmin role but we do wear a certain hat in it.
 We've communicated that we want to get these and other software approved as enterprise solutions where the end-user can have 1-2 options for the most common requests we get. Unfortunately, they have legal and the privacy team involved which just seem to align with whatever our CISO says. I've never seen any of the 3 teams contradict. Keep in mind that they are all approved by our Chief Technology Office for security review.

 Hi r/sysadmin,
 Just wanted to report on an issue i had this morning in case anyone else runs into it.
 Sit:
 Brand new Dell T440 running Windows 2022. All OS and firmware updates applied (thank you iDRAC!)
 System is stand-alone on a LAN2 network leg. No other devices are on the same subnet other than the internal leg of the firewall.
 Installed domain services
 Promoted system to be a DC, reboot, etc.
 Issue:
 Ethernet was showing as public or private but not as Domain. (Single port , 2nd is currently disabled)
 Normal fix of restarting Network Location Awareness and Network list service failed (NL hang)..
 Multiple reboots did not work although i could always log onto the console using the domain credentials.
 ​
 Fixes tried:
 Turned on preference for ipv4 over ipv6
 Downgraded the network drivers, Upgraded the network drivers, played with Ethernet metrics (temp fix only)
 EDIT:
 Set NLA to Delayed start (did NOT help)
 Fix that worked:
 Set a dependency for DNS for the NLA service in the registry.
 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc
 DependOnService -add DNS to the list
 Reboot. Problem solved.
 However the system still says Metered (even though it does not appear to be turned on, can download, full speed tests, etc.). I found references to this problem but no solutions so far if anyone has any ideas.
 Hope this saves someone else some precious time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are undergoing a re-write of many of our corporate policies and I would like to propose a system for managing these. To date, they are strewn about many different emails, SharePoint sites and Teams. Obviously this isn't sustainable.
 I'm not adverse to buying new software for this, however I generally am not a fan of niche software that isn't integrated with the rest of our systems.
 An ideal system would allow for certain people to update policies, but most (or all) employees being able to see the policies. It must either integrate with M365 or just be a solution native to the platform. Ideally folks would be able to track changes to the policy with different versions to see what's changed, and maybe get an alert when there is a new or updated policy.
 I figure I could do most of this with SharePoint but feels like I'd be building a lot of it from scratch. Any thoughts on what works well for you? I assume there are a lot of people frustrated by this and a lot of people thinking to themselves, "If I could build this all over again I'd do it this way...." so come at me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, here is a layout of this site:
 ​
 3 poweredge 730's, ESXi 6.5
 A NAS Datastore using iSCSI
 1 isolated network switch for communications between the hosts/datastores
 ​
 Yesterday, one of our remote sites had the strangest issues, I am still trying to make sense of it.
 Around 10am, I got a message that one of the hosts had a ConnectionStateAlarm. I remoted in and checked vsphere and sure enough, one of the three hosts at that site had a connection state issue. I acknowledged the alarm and checked the VPN circuit. It was pegged out (some type of NAS backup was running, this is not unusual). I cancelled the backup and the circuit went back to a normal state.
 I was thinking that host 1 would come back but it never did. I tried signing into ESXi through the web interface for the host, but the connection would time out on the page after putting in my credentials and hitting login. Tried SSH and I would get a connection refused. Logged in through iDRAC, rebooted the host. It came up without issue.
 So then, this happens on another host, we will call it host 2. Same deal, same site. I also cannot log into ESXi. I ended up getting into the iDRAC and rebooting the host. When it came up, it resynced and all was well. 
 FAST FORWARD AN HOUR LATER.
 I get an alarm that the third host is down and that an HA Event had failed. I logged in, one of my datastores is inaccessible and the third host is now down. This one, I cannot even get into the iDRAC, web interface or SSH.
 I got someone that was near the site to go and reboot the host manually from the rack, it came back up without issue. As for the datastore, I went into the connection & multipathing screen and had to manually mount it back to the first 2 hosts that we rebooted.
 All is back up and no alarms. I had generated support bundles to have VMWare check on this monday. Wow what a Saturday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to simulate a distributed fault-tolerant system consisting of multiple nodes. Each node runs a set of tasks or processes. Tasks communicate with each other by passing messages over the nodes' gates. I want to simulate a fault-tolerant mechanism where a node can fail and the system reconfigures itself by migrating tasks on the faulty node to other healthy nodes. I already developed an algorithm for migrating tasks but I want to test it with OMNeT++. 
 ​
 In the NED file, I have defined the network with the different nodes as submodules and tasks as submodules of the nodes (sub-submodules). But I can't connect the tasks with each other. 
 How can I simulate this behavior? Is there a better simulation tool than OMNeT++ for this use case?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this question we will explore the dynamics of two flows using the AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) and later AIAD (additive increase, additive
 decrease) algorithm instead of AIMD. Consider the topology shown in which two hosts A and B are sending packets to D through router R. 
 The bottleneck link in the path from R to D runs at 10 MB/s (i.e. 10 Megabytes per second). The RTTs from A to D and B to D are 100 ms. Assume that both A and B can
 communicate with R instantaneously and with arbitrarily large rate. Assume that each packet has a length of 1250 bytes and the buffer on router R can hold 200
 packets.
 Suppose that at time t = 0, host A has a congestion window of 999 packets, B has a congestion window of 0, and R’s buffer is empty. You should assume that packet
 drops are always experienced by the flow with more packets in flight. You should assume that each flow updates its congestion window after each RTT, decreasing it if
 any packet was dropped, and increasing it otherwise.
 AIMD: We first consider the evolution of the system when each flow is governed by AIMD, in which the congestion window grows by being incremented and shrinks by
 being halved (rounding down). In roundtrips 0 through 3, the system evolves as shown in the table below with host A exceeding the given congestion window size and
 accordingly reducing CWND to half in the next iteration. 
 Now, suppose that instead we are using an AIAD protocol. In this case, every drop decreases the congestion window by 5 packets (to a minimum of 1 packet) instead
 of halving the congestion window. What is the congestion windows size of host A at t = 300 RTTs? Give your answer in packets. 
 The solution states, it should be 300 but I do not understand why and there is nothing else provided.

 It also stops regularly between labels to think about what to do next.
 Should this device use port RAW or LPR to get optimal efficient printing speed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I've been working in IT for about 15 total years in some capacity. (Freelance and Professional or Contract) Education: Associates in Computer Science /COMPTIA A+ / Network+ / Security+
 I've been working in Data Center roles and lower level engineer roles for some extremely large companies over the last 6 years now and my salary has increased by about $19/hr from 2018 until now. 
 I started out at $11/hr in 2016 Most recent role - $33/hr by end of 2022
 About to start a new job in a week or two, but I got blindsided by another offer from a different company while I'm waiting for my equipment in the mail, sliding me about $15,000 more a year.
 I've been making between $55,000 - $72,000 per year through my last 3/4 positions I've held and have gained a lot more experience during these last few years as well. 
 I'm currently about to start a new job, I am being offered $70,000/yr and about to begin onboarding/training for this role before Feb 15th. However I was just offered another role through a different company, fully remote sysadmin for about $85,000/yr. 
 My questions are mainly... based on anyone else's experience in sysadmin work in the Midwest, should I try to aim for closer to $90k based on my experience? 
 Should I just shut up and take the money?? Or should I aim higher for somewhere between $90k-$100k?
 (This is my first time specifically doing work with a "sysadmin" title, but been performing the same work through other roles I've held in recent years)
 I've looked up some Glassdoor avg salaries for the title but it was a pretty wide range, something like 55k-120k/yr?
 If anyone can help me out with this I'd really appreciate it as I'm trying to pursue making a big change in my life and move towards settling down and building a family with my fiancee. Whatever role will end up offering more in terms of salary and job happiness will be more important to me.

 I left a big corp network job to go to a smaller company for a "promotion" to network engineer with a few K more money. Now the company I left is asking me to come back. They are offering me more than I have now and a true engineer position. I have only been with the new company for 2 months and have never been a job hopping person. I loved where I left, but with some political work there may be some potential for the new company. Tho it was going from CLI to Meraki Dashboard. I am stuck as to what I should do to progress my career. I have an engineer I am working with now who has been here for 10+ years with no progression. 
 I guess my question is should I leave for even more experience in cli with my last company or should I just stay for now and try to change this companies' climate and maybe learn more meraki?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am about to get fiberoptic installed at a rural location. Mobile signal is unreliable at best and sometimes we lose electricity for days and with an elderly parent living there, access to emergency service is a primary concern. Especially as we will have to give up our copper line. 
 My understanding is that as long as we keep power supplied to the ONT, phones and networking in the house will work. My first instinct was to buy the beefiest UPS we can afford, but I have had a UPS die in a puff of smoke. It would be a cruel twist of fate if the backup battery that we installed to maintain emergency communications started a fire and harmed my mother.
 I notice that there are UPSs that are marketed specifically for telecom equipment, such as those listed here:
 https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/products/telecom/indoor/ 
 I notice that these are rather expensive given their output compared to UPSs sold for computers. Is there something special about them? 
 - For example are they optimized for providing lower power over more time? This would make sense for network equipment, whereas computer UPSs are made to keep a desktop computer going at full power for just enought time to shut down. Or would a bigger UPS designed for a computer simply last longer when powering low-power devices?
 ​
 - Might there be safety/fire precautions on these that aren't on regular UPSs? 
 - Any other reasons I might pay extra per watt of power output for one of thse "telecom" UPSs?

 It's been suggested that I use a small vps with a public facing file folder. Problem is I have no idea how to set that up, and less of an idea as to who to host with. The files themselves are a total of maybe 10-15mb, but will be downloaded multiple times a day.

Whenever, a user is logged in using a smart card or tries to log in using a smart card, certain services can no longer be restarted, such as the print spooler. We get error 1747, the authentication service is unknown. Nothing we have tried has resolved the issue except not installing ActivClient. The most interesting thing is that machines that were loaded with 21H2 that already have ActivClient installed are them work fine if we do an in-place upgrade on them to 22H2. The issue only occurs on cleanly loaded machines. Has anyone ever seen anything like this, and is anyone running ActivClient on Windows 11 22H2?

 Anyways, I tried the classic pressing "mode" button during power-on. Despite me giving all my might and pressing/holding for upwards of a minute, the switch does not seem to enter the "switch:" prompt. It always boots normally. I tried different permutation of 5 seconds, 15, seconds, pressing mode when I unplug power, then continuing to hold when I plug power back in, etc.
 I explored other alternatives by breaking the boot. But that doesn't seem to work either - when I'm consoled in, using firstly PuTTY, then Teraterm and sending break commands didn't work either.
 When it boots, I do see a message: The password-recovery mechanism is enabled.
 But it continues to boot normally into a configuration of a password I cannot remember.
 Any guidance would be appreciated.

 Backup the old profiles: On the Windows Server 2012R2, open the File Explorer and navigate to the folder where user profiles are stored. This folder is typically located in C:\Users. Right-click on the folder and select "Export" to backup each user profile.

The objective is to create corresponding setup guides and compile the necessary lab setup resources together for the team's future use. Our repository hasn't been updated since the system's deployment. Right now, I'm working on the setup of a particular server in the lab, which was only introduced during the system's mid-life upgrade. As such, there were no setup documentation for it and I had to reverse engineer the existing server to make guides for it from scratch.
 One of the software deployed in the system is SharePoint Portal Server 2003. It took me a while to realise that the version deployed in production is updated to Service Pack 3, but I only have the base version's installer. I searched high and low and haven't been able to find the SP3 installer anywhere in my office's repositories. The official download link from Microsoft is dead too.
 Does anyone know where I can get this file (likely named SPS2003SP3-kb923644-fullfile-ENU.exe - KB923644), or where I can go to ask? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm still new to networking and haven't experienced too much with Public DNS records. 
 but for information, the design is that there are 2 DNS servers setting between the Router and the Firewall. The Router is in front so the structure is ISP - Router - DNS - Firewall - Internal Network. 
 This external DNS keeps the Host and only Host A files that lets the internet know that website A is IP whatever for the college. 
 I believe the DNS servers forward the traffic to Quad9 or something like that, not sure why, but if some one can assist to the reason, I'm sure its a verification method or something to proof that we are the actual college we are advertising or to tell other larger DNS providers know who we are if some one form another state tries to reach our website. 
 So on to my question. Is there a better way? I would like to move our records off site to something like cloud flair. However I set up a meeting with them and they said the minimum they covered was for websites that hit 1 million hits per month. Obviously its a community college in a rural area so we get around 17,000 hits. Then they wanted $20,000 a year. 
 Now I was trying to keep my cool, but choking inside, so I didn't get a chance to clarify, but I think they thought I wanted some of the premium features and such when really I just wanted to host A records so we had a cloud DNS and if that's just a free thing or if we have to pay a fee. I think it was confusion because the prices on the website did not match up to what they were telling me. 
 Can any one clarify if Cloud Flair is free to host records and all I have to do is just verify that we are who we say we are? 
 or really any better solution to external DNS hosting or is it fine the way we have it set up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m curious what everyone’s day to day is like in their role. I’m a Network Administrator in the Marine Corps with 7ish years of experience and debating on leaving once my contract is up in a couple of years because I don’t want to move around anymore. I’m just worried I’m not going to enjoy what I do once I get out because currently I get to work on a lot of equipment and it’s honestly a lot of fun. I’m also curious if anyone has a role/job somewhat similar to what I do? For instance, at a typical training exercise I get to setup an equipment string supporting about 50-200 users which includes a Satellite Transmissions System or fiber connection and connect it to my router which connects via DMVPN to a NOC and pull services from there. I also get to setup/configure all switches to other offices (tents) to end devices and some encryption equipment and VoIP thrown in there as well. Usually it’s me and 1-2 other people doing all of this and we get a lot of time configuring which I enjoy. So I guess I’m just curious if anyone gets exposed to a lot of different equipment or do you mainly stick to a specific area of configuration? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Experts,
 We are looking to setup something unique and get two firewalls setup behind our Comcast EDI. The challenge we are having is we need to route are usable block of /27 to different WAN /29 address on two firewalls.
 Comcast has given us
 P2P IP:xxx.xxx.xxx.232/29 Gateway (.233) Comcast router Customer Layer 3 (.234)Customer Useable IP’s: xxx.xxx.xxx.235 – xxx.xxx.xxx.238
 and we have Usable EDI Static Range: yyy.yyy.yyy.225-.254 and this is 255.255.255.224 or /27
 I think that Comcast sends our Usable range to the xxx.xxx.xxx.234 address. 
 What I have tried is to assign the .234 to a VLAN on our Dell N4000 switch with routing enabled. Then I assigned .235 and .236 to WAN interface on each firewall.
 Our issue comes when trying to setup a route in the table to send yyy.yyy.yyy.226 to the .235 ip. We are going to have to send different usable to the different firewalls. The switch complains that the rout is invalid, which makes sense since its a different network.
 Lots of people suggest getting an EdgeRouter X, would that let me do this?
 Any suggestions on getting our switch to do this type of routing?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posting this from r/askanelectrician since it is specific to server hardware.
 Context:
 I have a server PSU that seems to only work with a C13/C14 cord. The specs of the server PSU are:
 Edit: Here is a picture of the PSU: https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/static/media/9198938f-8c47-5a0e-82d9-6db6a62cd3f7/DAM-ccd92840-c3fa-4d5c-9c55-cf231e6069f4/out/2711.024.jpg
 Max input power: 100 to 240 VAC +/- 10%, single phase
 AC line current: 10.6A @ 100 VAC, 5.3 A @ 200 VAC
 AC Inlet Type: IEC320-C14 (high-line, 200 VAC), IEC320-C20 (low-line, 100 VAC)
 Issue:
 I have a 120V PDU that has NEMA 5-20 receptacles (L5-30 input). The PSU will not power on with a C13/NEMA 5-15 or C13/NEMA 5-20 cord. I want to use this PDU.
 I also have a 200-240V PDU (L6-30 input) with C14 inputs. The PSU works when using a C13/C14 cord in this PDU. I don't want to use this PDU.
 Question:
 Can someone give a quick explanation of these power requirements/specs on the PSU? My interpretation is that the PSU supports 120V thus a NEMA 5-15/NEMA 5-20 cable should be enough to power the PSU.
 Am I misinterpreting the specs or does the PSU have some sort of sensing ability to know that an IEC plug is not being used? FWIW, daisy-chaining C13/C14 into C13/NEMA x also doesn't work.
 Edit:
 I have talked to Dell about this and they suggested getting a C13/NEMA 5-20P cable. I did and it still didn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have recently been trying to find out a deep dive into what exactly networking ports are. This is regarding TCP and UDP ports.
 Whenever I search what exactly are networking ports, I see explanations about how they are a way to identify a service. 
 I have not seen explanations on how this is achieved.
 When a server receives a request on port 22, the TCP/IP stack inspects the destination port, and sees the number 22 there. Is the TCP/IP stack configured in such a way that each port number must be associated with a certain service, like if the number is 22, then forward the request to the sshd service?
 After the TCP/IP stack inspects the port number, will it forward the request to the relevant service - sshd in this case?
 I have thought of ports as "gates" to remotely access a service. Each service has its own PID, but this PID stays local, so ports are a way to access these services remotely. We won't be able to remotely access the service by its PID. But we can access the service if there is a TCP/IP stack that does the forwarding of request based on the destination port number?
 The questions above are just my own explanation of how ports are bound to services, and how the TCP/IP stack assists in forwarding the request to the relevant service. If anybody has knowledge in this, it would be great for someone to share it.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/sysadmin!
 I can't wrap up my mind around this. Earlier this week at my workplace I had a iSCSI target from a Synology RackStation RS3614xs+ NAS (DSM 6.2.2-24922) suddenly disconnect overnight on a Windows Server. When I started investigating after noticing the issue, DSM tells me in the storage manager that "There is no volume in your system". 12-disk RAID6 is fine, alive and healthy, S.M.A.R.T. of all disks displays a "Normal/Healthy" status so nothing to worry about I think (only 1 disk mentioned 1 bad sector at the time after the sudden target disconnect). Storage pool is also operating normally from what DSM shows.
 I can still access the target, the data is still there but this volume "missing" in DSM is getting me a little worried.
 Every other RackStation NAS (configured with iSCSI/LUNs) we have currently running and everything I see on the web says that on a Synology NAS a LUN is located on a volume (like Volume 1) and not straight on a storage pool.
 I'm no expert in storage topics and still learning but everything I see in my investigation of the issue points in the direction that this is not a normal behavior. I searched on the web for a similar experience and cannot find cases where LUNs point straight to storage pool location instead of like an ext4 volume for example.
 What are your thoughts about this?
 Please let me know if additional context and details (even logs or output of CLI commands) are needed.
 Thanks in advance for your insight, and have a nice day!

 I’ve been tasked with updating our site Content Security Headers. We currently have a couple of old ones on there. Our pen-testers want us to get rid of the one header that is “script-src ‘self’” I figured I would remove that then add in our domain name so that way anything that comes from our site is approved. I have our active CSP headers so when I added our domain it is in a new CSP Report only. But I keep getting the error that the directive name contains one or more invalid characters. I’ve double checked to make sure there wasn’t an exception xtra space or anything and cannot get it to work. This is what I have now:
 Content-securit-policy Script-src ‘self’
 Content-security-policy report only HTTPS://example.com
 This is the first time I have dealt with security headers and cannot seem to figure this out. I’m sure it’s simple but frustrating. Thanks for the help.

 I've got two WAN connections in a failover arrangement:
 WAN1 FTTP
 WAN2 5G failover
 VLANs:
 1 10 20 30 200
 In the UI dashboard its not giving accurate info on how much data is flowing between the different vlans... is this normal?
 so lets say the sky glass is active and pulling 20Mbps I would expect it to show this via the IoT vlan but it does not.
 also the traffic analysis tab does not show hardly any data for any nodes connected. for example i have run about 10 speed tests and downloaded a 1.1gb iso from my pc, yet it only shows 7.86MB of data logged.
 is this just a bug with the EdgerouterX?
 TIA
 ​
 Edit: so this is apparently because the interfaces only show the overhead of the vlans and not total traffic.

 I've got a requirement where I think Postfix would be ideal I just can't find/remember the exact term in Postfix for what I want to do so would appreciate a little reminder 😀
 I need a Postfix box on an internal LAN to accept mail from the internal /24 and if it's for @domain1.com or @domain2.com to forward it onto a smart host (the smart host will accept and relay from the IP of the Postfix box so no need to authenticate).
 However if it's for anythingelse.com I only want it to relay it using the same smart host if it comes from certain IPs within the internal /24.
 So mail from 192.168.1.0/24 to domain1.com or domain2.com = accept and relay.
 Mail from 192.186.1.10 and 192.168.10.15 to anydomain.com = accept and relay.
 There are no local mailboxes in use.
 Thanks in advance.

 Last year I was hired by a company here Denmark to be an IT admin and recently I was given the task to build a troubleshooting lab for the Network/Security engineers.
 The objective of this lab is so that when they face a problem with a customer's device (which is in production), they can quickly spin up a VM in our lab environment and run tests on it.
 We will use a single server running VMware EXsi for the VMs.
 Ideally I would like to give the engineers the freedom to create their own VMs using some type of GUI (instead of keeping that extra administrative work for myself), but I also want to restrict them from creating a ridiculous amount of VMs, or assigning a ridiculous amount of resources to the VMs, and Ideally this would all have AAA (so I can know who created what and when).
 What tools do you recommend for a setup like this? This is my first time leading a project like this and I am a bit lost !
 Thank you in advance!

 I already opened a post, for another question. This one is partly a rant, but also partly a call for help.
 This is about an argument I had with my colleague. I don't know where he comes up with such ideas.
 We tasked to conceptualize a new ip address concept for our location. We have 200-250 employees, everyone with notebooks and smartphones. In total we come up with 500~ unique ip addresses.
 We don't expect to grow much, because we are limited by the size of our offices.
 We have 3 buildings, each with 3 floors. I rather expect, that we will build smaller branched offices in the future, if we ever fill up our current location.
 Thats all fine. Basic stuff. Thats like the 1,2,3 of a sysadmin. I did stuff like that in school and got tasks like this even as an exam …]]></summary>

 Solution I was thinking- We will go to every laptop this time make sure we push the bios config to power on every Sunday- SCCM will do the updates for us just like how we always been..
 Any recommendations or advice as well from your own solutions that is keeping your laptop's updated in their carts? Any GPO's that we can push to the laptops as well. The laptops are always plugged with power via the usb-c power adapters. We have ap's in every room that has a laptop cart.
 Its just getting tiresome to do all hunt down the ones that hasn't been patched manually as the #of laptops is growing and its not all in the same building. Thanks for your help and any advice is welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone,
 I seek for aid in conceptualizing a new network for my company.
 During my conversations with my colleague we came up with the question where to put the default gateway of our subnets.I remember that my old teacher back in school told me, to put the default gateway at the end of a subnet. e.g. 192.168.178.254/24 I can't remember why again. Something with growth and expansion of the network. I can't get it together anymore.
 Though, from my old companies I know that they all put their default gateway at the beginning of a network, e.g. 192.168.178.1/24
 What do you think? Is there an actual reason for the one or the other, or is it just personal preference?
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very weird question I know.
 But I figure if anyone has been around long enough in technology that remembers anything about this, its like Sysadmin and perhaps a handful of Guru's here. 
 So from 2018-2020 I worked for a Newspaper IT department in my first real IT job .
 To place our ads we used a certain program and boy howdy this sucker was old.
 I never got a specific timeframe on its age , I heard some staff saying they had seen a version of it or something similar to it when they worked in the 70's/80's, I knew support for it ended like in 2009 and the interface was pure keyboard based and looked like something something that would not have been out of place on DOS with its blocky text and minimal colors.
 I am fairly certain we were the last company in the world using it, we had to modify it to work on modern Mac OSX and windows machines , run it deep in wineskin.
 The thing was so old, that whenever it crashed or corrupted the staff just installed a fresh zipped copy on the affected workstation and it was so small that you could transfer it quickly, even on a Apple Remote Desktop setup, it transferred in like 10-15 seconds. 
 Now I am not sure if our versions name was changed after all the modifying or all the companies assets were barely online, but when I search for it (mostly to share with people to show them the older stuff I have worked on), all I get is info on cameras or wall mountings.
 ​
 Was curious if anyone knows what I am talking about and its proper name or even some screenshots of it in all of its DOS glory.
 Not a big deal, but I thought I'd ask

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone! I´m sorry for my bad English, I from Argentine and don´t speak English.
 I currently work as Sysadmin in Argentine Hospital. I am the first in the IT position in this health company. The basic infrastructure was made by two guys many years ago and today it's my turn to "professionalize" the area. Not a minor fact: It is my first job as a SysAdmin and after 6 months I feel ready to start putting everything together seriously.
 The service consists of the following terminals:
  
Forty (40) Personales Computers with Windows 10 (1 Standard user and 1 administrator user for restriction on each PC). 
 Printers and access points (At the moment I am not interested in this point). 
  
I need to implement a:
  
Ticket System (because currently I only use Gmail to manage orders.) Which do you recommend? Where possible free.
 A software for remote access to the terminals. I currently use TeamViewer. I was looking at Radmin, maybe TW will change it to Radmin. What do you think? I like the Radmin interface better and how little intrusive it is.
 
A software to monitor the network. Here I am adrift, any recommendations or advice? The network consists of a Mikrotik Router, a main non-manageable Switch and then an access Switch per floor that distributes to the terminals via UTP Cat5e. 
 
Any other point that they consider necessary to implement...
 A simple network schematic...
 
 What I appreciate most are the advice or experiences. I read in Google and use Udemy to learn right now, I survived out of necessity. But I want to start professionalizing myself and professionalize my modest system.
 Thank you in advance.
 ¡Gracias!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for an option for re-deploying some Surface Go tablets as wall mounted Spotify kiosks. I've tried the usual UWP kiosk powershell in Windows but Spotify is strange in that it appears it is now an plug-in for the xbox game bar UWP app. It can't be found in the GUI to set up a kiosk app, and if you try to run SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Spotify it just gets stuck in a loop until I remote powershell in and remove the kiosk setting. If you use SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Widget it displays "We weren't able to start your app." and an error code which indicates an operation was not supported.
 I've considered Edge fullscreen but the web-based can only cast to Spotify Connect devices they've previously registered and as this is at a school, giving access to an unauthenticated web browser is something I'd rather avoid.
 Another potential is BlissOS (Androidx86) but then I need to put in time to get that working with an MDM if it is even possible.
 If I can get it working, I'll design a secure-ish wall mount and 3D print as many as needed. (we have 30 of them) I was also considering using them for control panels for certain building automations (is there a more commercial focused option like homeassistant?) and also for using with Xibo for digital signage.
 Background: I'm the solo IT person for a special school, always looking for cheaper ways of doing things which make these kids' lives a bit better. The more I can save, the more I can spend on IT based programs which help their learning. If I had loads of money, I'd just buy iPads for this. Reason we have Surface Go is we're a 100% windows school, no apple, no Google Apps Suite Workspace.

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\

Values of 0-50 are valid and it is set as "2" and the laptop has been restarted, but only one logon is being cached. If "run as" is used with a second account, the original user is no longer able to logon offline. 
 Is there anything else than needs to be done to make this work?
 Is there any method to view which user account or accounts logons are currently cached on a device?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a hilarious scenario at a school I provide IT support for.. Its one of those things that happen in IT where if I were to tell someone they would instantly think it was bs. And in the moment you don't quite believe whats happening yourself.
 So, this school they have a 40mbps VDSL line. As you can imagine with over 200 devices on the network at times this is pretty slow. Today the download speed was 0.4 mbps with a 800ms ping. How they survive on this I will never know. I'm constantly trying to get them to upgrade to fibre but they just do not have the budget to do that. There network equipment is a mess too, they have a Dell Sonicwall router about 12 year old and Cisco switches from about 10 years ago. They recently upgraded a couple of switches to unifi and how have unifi ac pro access points.
 ​
 Today I was going round seeing if anyone had any issues in their classrooms and a staff member approached me asking why they had been asked to turn off ALL devices in their class. I walked around and everybody was turning all their devices off, it felt like apocalypse scene in a movie. The person who told them to turn everything off I went and asked her why this had happened and her response was "I needed to download a large file and the internet is too slow". I couldn't stop laughing. I had never heard of anything so outrageous in my life. The funny thing was, 75% devices dropped off the network and the speed was 2mbps download. 
 ​
 Its so hard working with schools to improve their tech when they quite literally don't have the budget to upgrade stuff. They upgraded their servers a couple years ago but that was because they literally failed constantly.
 ​
 Thought this story was too funny not to share.

 I lost the last 3 days trying to get a lab of 8 N9Kvs to stay online and as soon as I fired up my old eve-ng v2 it worked fine. I transferred the n9k image from v2 to v5 so it’s the exact same image.
 Any idea why v5 would be so much less stable for me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context I am mainly a wireless guy (RF design/testing), with some light networking background. I am looking at rolling out a new Meraki 9164 access point deployment. It is my understanding that to use 6 GHZ and 802.1X authentication I am required to use WPA3-Enterprise encryption (Also see Meraki article titled "WPA3 Encryption and Configuration Guide". With WPA2-Enterprise I was able to use EAP-PEAP MS-Chapv2, but I am getting the feeling that PEAP MS-Chapv2 is not supported on WPA3 Enterprise? Meraki's article states:
 To use WPA3 enterprise, the RADIUS servers must use one of the permitted EAP ciphers:
  
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  
So I am hoping to find the answer to a few questions:
  
Does WPA3 Enterprise support only EAP-TLS?
 
Is this ubiquitous to all WPA3 enterprise deployments? (standards based requirement)
 If WPA3 Enterprise supports supports other EAP types, what are those? Source would be great!
 As I am not very familiar with EAP-TLS, does that mean I would be required to have Server AND CLIENT certificates?
 
Are there any straightforward guides to learning more about EAP-TLS and how to deploy?
  
Thanks for any insight!

 Would it make sense to create one Network SSID to apply to devices at all locations at once or is that even possible?
 The problem we are having is that we are running out of DHCP leases on our current wireless network and would like to sparse out users/devices so that more IPs will become available.
 Should we have a unique scope/VLAN created for each location separately or would it be possible/more efficient to have the entire wireless network we are creating for all locations being associated with just one scope/VLAN?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 In my assignment I have to design a network with following components:
  
Firewall (Fortigate) x 2 
  
ISP #1 (Primary) 
 ISP #2 (Secondary/Backup) 
 Backbone Switch x 2 
 Switch Stack (3 switches) 
 Network Printer 
 Server 
 Laptop - using WiFi 
 Access Points - 2 Units 
 
  
Configuration: 
 ● Both of the firewalls should be in cluster (HA) 
 ● Both ISP’s should be in active-passive mode with dependency with the firewall cluster. 
 ● Each device(server, printer, AP, laptop) should have its own VLAN and be isolated from the other devices. 
 ● Backbone & Stack switches should be on the same VLAN as the laptop. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I drew up this diagram: https://ibb.co/fxnWW51
 What is the best practice for this kind of network?
 Where i get confused is - where would you configure routing and interVLAN traffic? On Fortigate or core switches. In my research I'm getting mixed suggestions - Some say that core switches are for routing, when others say that core switches have to be as fast as possible and have minimal tasks dedicated to them.
 I would appreciate any kind of help, and sorry for stupid questions.

 We have a C9200L-48P-4X which has a single port, which happens to be empty, in an up state with a solid amber light. The switch sees itself as a cdp neighbor on this port, showing the same port ID for both sides:
 usnosw12-113#sh cdp n Device ID Local Intrfce Holdtme Capability Platform Port ID usnosw12-113 Gig 1/0/2 165 S I C9200L-48 Gig 1/0/2 
 There's no config on the port. I'm thinking it's just a repair case but I wanted to ask in case there's a chance it's something else.

Open Registry Editor
 Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RasMan\PPP\EAP\13
 Create DWORD key TlsVersion value FC0
 Gpupdate /force
 reboot
  
Done
 ​
 Weird problem.
 We have a couple users who snuck in and updated their machines to Windows 11 before we locked that down. We also have a group policy that we designed for Windows 10 that deploys the info for all the SSIDs across all offices to all computers. It is set to reach out to RADIUS to verify ID, so users never have to log in.
 This GPO works great on all Windows 10 machines, and according to our other SysAdmin, it worked fine for 11 until 22H2 dropped. Now, users see the network that was pushed by GPO, but it tells them they "Can't connect to this network".
 I can log in to one of the Win11 machines and manually tell it to get on the "Hidden Network" and give it all the info, and that manually configured one works fine.
 If I check the GPO on the Win11 machine, Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies and open the policy we created, then open the properties of the network, then go to the Security tab. I verify that it is using Secured Password (EAP-MSCHAP v2) as the Authentication Method and click Configure, but the EAP MSCHAPv2 properties window that pops up has the "When connecting: Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any) box unchecked and is greyed out. On the Win10 machines, though, that is checked.
 Given that, I'm assuming that the reason they can't connect is due to the Windows logon name and password not being pushed. Just not sure why the GPO isn't configuring that correctly in Windows 11.
 Any thoughts?

 EDIT: I have eve-ng pro 5.0.1-20, it's recently installed. I think I helped my ssd out a little bit with these fixes:
  
edited these two lines in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
  
​
 # max_binlog_size = 100M skip-log-bin 
 Since I have no plans on making this a cluster server for eve in the future I just disabled the binlog/logbin feature. This partially helped my problem, I noticed slightly less disk IO, but there was still a lot. It maybe decreased things by 10-25%. But the overall disk usage will not continually climb from the /var/lib/mysql/binlog.xxxxxx files.
 iotop showed this yet: 567481 be/4 mysql 0.00 B/s 551.38 K/s ?unavailable? mysqld [ib_pg_flush_co]
 ib_pg_flush_co was still writing a lot. So I did an strace of that process and it was doing io_submit about once a second. I just happened to google the very last option in the mysqld.cnf file "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2". A quick google suggests that it forces a write cycle once a second.
  
 edited "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2" from 2 to 1 (the default), and restarted mysql again.
  
EDIT2: This only worked temporarily. After a reboot of the eve-ng box the issue came back. and ib_pg_flush_co is still writing to disk constantly.

 We are planning on connecting two switches together with the QSFP-40G-SR4-S and I have to order the correct leads.
 Since its a transceiver to-transceiver that would make it a type B connection. 
 According to the Cisco webstie it says:
 QSFP-40G-SR4-S
 40GBASE-SR4, 4 lanes, 850 nm MMF
 MPO-12
 Does it mean that when Im placing an order for the correct lead, it should be 8 fibres, Type B Cross polarity and Female to Female or Male to Male? Please help... TIA.

 A program should not require sysinternals to disable a program at startup. A program should not persist after uninstalling it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heyo, newer to the Fortinet world. I’ve used a lot of Palo Alto in the past and I guess I adjusted to the way I can view traffic logs on the local device and easily filter through them. 
 Do any of you have experience making a Fortigate local logs more accessible and easily filtered? 
 I’ve messed around in the CLI looking at logs. Changed a few log options. But still only seem to be able to see the last 10 or so logs. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone,
 Our org currently uses AnyConnect VPN for remote access. We have it configured for the Windows pre-logon as well, and we instruct people to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer. Our reasoning was because things like GPOs and logon scripts seemed to "work best" or even possibly only work if the user signed into the computer while being "on network"(with the VPN active).
 I have the ability to switch our AnyConnect VPN setup to have our firewall point directly to Azure for MFA purposes, but that config does not support the ability to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer. Wouldn't that be a problem again for logon GPOs and logon scripts?
 What do other orgs do to solve for this that have users sign into a VPN AFTER signing into their computer instead of before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 Recently i've been hired as a server administrator for an IT company in my area. I got the job because my education background is in software development and they want to train me as a server admin + use my programming skills for powershell scripting & automation.
 The onboard training is totally fine, I'm comfortable in the M365 admin portal and AD seems straight forward enough, but where I have no actual training (outside of a brief course I took semester one) I was wondering if there are any recommended online courses? Through Udemy or somewhere else. When I was learning programming the Odin Project helped a lot with my understanding of the webdev side of things so I was hoping there's something similar for sys admin.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated, otherwise I'll just pick the highest rated course on Udemy lol.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been at the same company for nearly 15 years, late 30's. My salary is at $110k which for here in Ohio has offered a good life. I've been debating back and forth about applying for other jobs to at least test the market to see what I'm worth. I'm a Senior Monitoring Engineer and work with tools such as App Dynamics, Splunk, DataDog, etc. My wife and I have a baby on the way (our first and only) so I've been pondering if I should explorer other options to increase my salary.
 However, things are going very well where I work which is a good thing. The company I work at has been very stable, work life balance is excellent with typically no more then 40 hours per week, remote 4 days per week, have 6 weeks of vacation, and the other benefits (7% 401k matching, health care is under $200 a month for a family, bonus is usually around $7k) are good as well. I've seen some other job listings in my field would offer a good bump in pay but I'm hesitant to even leave. I start thinking "Is now the right time to really leave with the way the economy is", and "my wife and I having a baby on the way, stay where it's been stable". On the other hand I also think "I've been here nearly 15 years, let's see what's out there and what I'm worth". Maybe there's no harm in at least applying for some of these positions.
 What would you do? How much is stability, work life balance and remote work worth to you?

 Do computer and user authentication require separate EAP-TLS Network Polices or can they share they same one combined? When I've combined them into the same policy with every combination of User, Computer and Windows groups, it didn't work.

That being the disclaimer..... the sales managers have said text your customers, the sales team did with great success and close deals.... Now they need to get away for a day or week for vacation or for health reasons..... We can't take care of the customer because they leave their cell phone at home. (I would too if I was on vacation)....
 So I am trying to get inside sales access to all their imessages for a small period of time. 
 I tried Verizon message plus, but deleting all history with a customer of a few years is a hard push back and you lose historical and disable imessage all together... Clunky. 
 I have found that if I take an iPhone with no service and hook it up to the wireless, sign into their icloud on the phone I can text! But I still have to deliver a spare iPhone to someone to cover..... I have thought about a virtual macos that people can remote into.... But before I reinvent the wheel again... Is there something easier? Anyone in my boat? Thanks redit kingdom

 I know the theory (mostly) and the commands, but what I'm struggling with is that I've been told that VLANs should each have their own subnet if best practices are followed which makes sense to me. 
 However as far as I'm aware you can't configure subnets on a layer two switch. It needs to either be a router, or a layer three switch.
 Bearing that in mind how is it possible to have multiple VLANs on a single layer two switch whilst ensuring that each VLAN has its own subnet. It doesn't seem possible to me.
 I asked my lecturer but found my questions leading in circles. The lecturer confirmed that you can't subnet ports on a layer two switch, but then when I said "So you can't have a subnet for each VLAN at the layer two switch then (unless you're only using one VLAN for all ports)?" and was told: "Yes you can". And repeat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a little data center that's growing and now have a little over 70 windows server VM's. Little tasks like do X, then repeat 70+ times are good for security but there must be a better way. Unfortunately we are on windows so all the linux thing's I'm thinking of aren't going to work.
 X could be any combination of these; 
  
start/stop service
 place a provided file in a location (not shared folder)
 read & report contents of a text file
 run a executable
 pretty much anything you can do CLI
  
For example at the moment I find myself updating OpenVPN. Place the provided msi in Downloads, stop the service, run the installer, check for installer errors, start service, after 1 minute delay open the OpenVPN log and review for errors. The error review in this case requires a human but if it simply dumped the log file somewhere I can get to it on a orchestration machine, renamed it with what server it came from that would be perfect. 
 I'm searching and finding a LOT of posts about automating windows updates, but I think we finally have WSUS under control.

 I've already created a guide for the actual process of setting up Win 11 on their new laptops, but I still wanted to create a little fact sheet of changes between Windows 10 and 11. This is for an insurance company, so the changes should be focused more on GUI changes rather than changes to things like performance or new widgets(for the most part, if the software isn't in our Company Portal, we don't want them installing it anyway). 
 I personally haven't used Win 11 that much(the project kind of got sprung on me short notice) so simply writing the differences I've noticed might not be too helpful and most articles I've read only give a nod towards look and feel changes then focus on things like gaming performance. 
 I don't mind doing the actual reading myself, so links will be enough, but if anyone has brief summaries of changes, that would also help immensely. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all !
 I might need your insight here ! As we are moving out of sccm to WS1, our security department is quite demanding regarding our packaging standards.
 Basically, in our packages we might have "sensitive information" ( licence server , accounts , database ...) Plainly visible in scripts ( most of time we are using PSADT ) and they want us to encrypt / hide as much as possible these data. 
 File Encryption seems quite difficult to setup for such purposes (due to find a way to make the package usable through WS1, and decrypt it on devices !) , Hide through full encapsulation in .MST / MSI might cause tons of rework and aditiional loads... Any idea on your side ? Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we've got a bit of an annoying issue with some Windows 11 field devices. They use some in-built 4g connectivity when out and about.
 The issue is that when in patchy signal, the AOVPN tries a few times to connect and then stops trying to auto-connect.
 This appears to happen only for Windows 11 devices. There doesn't appear to be a GPO option to force the auto-connect functionality back on.
 Another issue is that we can't disable the option to untick 'Connect Automatically', so the user can untick it and the VPN won't automatically connect. Is there any GPO or setting that I'm missing which will help? 
 I'm aware that this is a 'minor' inconvenience which could be solved with User Training but management have insisted that these field engineers are dumb as bricks and will just complain so it's easier to just get the VPN to try all the time constantly.
 I'm looking into a scheduled task fired on Network Connection successful but wanted a second opinion. Any ideas?

 I have a scenario that I need to get some clarity on as I cannot find any real answers online.
 We have Macbooks that are on Apple Business Manager and the company also wants to enrol them into Intune to deploy policies and profiles etc in line with company security policies. However, they would also like the Macbooks to be able to sign in with AAD credentials rather than AD credentials. Is it possible to link ABM with both Intune and AAD, rather than Intune and then configuration profiles to setup directory utility for AD?
 I see articles around setting up a Federation between ABM and AAD: Intro to federated authentication with Apple Business Manager – Apple Support (UK) but then is this the same as this: Tutorial: Configure Apple Business Manager for automatic user provisioning with Azure Active Directory - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn 
 With the above, can we then still utilise automatic enrolment into Intune with ABM like this: Enroll macOS devices - Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager | Microsoft Learn

 ​
 We are making some changes to our environment in regards to allowing AAD groups to be synced on prem, basically so certain groups are mirrored across the board.
 However once we enabled group write back against a set of groups we started getting the following error.
 ​
 The sync rules in scope have a mix of Persistent and ExecuteOnce attribute flows for the same destination attribute: msExchMailboxGuid
 ​
 at Microsoft.MetadirectoryServices.SyncRulesEngine.JoinModule.ValidateAllApplicableSyncRules(IEnumerable\1 applicableSyncRules)`
 at Microsoft.MetadirectoryServices.SyncRulesEngine.JoinModule.Execute(PipelineArguments argsToProcess)

 at ManagedSyncRulesEngine.Synchronize(ManagedSyncRulesEngine* , CCsObject* sourceCsObject, CMvObject* mvObject, SynchronizationOperation operation, Char** error)
 InnerException=>
 none
 Native call stack: 
 ​
 Not exactly sure what this is? I assume its to do with us pointing on prem AD to look at mailboxes in Azure? we had no choice to do this as our move to Azure was in an emergency response.
 ​
 Any suggestions, currently we are just wanting to get the basic sync between on-prem and AAD working until we can figure out the rest, but we get this error on most if not all users.
 ​
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins, I need to run a sanity check hope you can shed some light.
 I've inherited an environment, I'm still discovering and learning about it. It's an on-prem bare-metal/VMware, public cloud is minimal and completely independant. One concern that I have is that I'm seen some odd DHCP reservations for productions servers.
 To give an idea, I've seen DHCP reservation for MS-SQL database server, Domain controllers (all of them), Application Servers, anything that seems to be a production server where many people connect to, it is likely to have a reservation.
 Then in some cases, not all of them, the server has a static IP address assigned, despite of having a reservation. And you probably guess it, the IP address statically assigned to that server is in the DHCP range where other Desktop computers are also connected. This causes that the DHCP report the reservation as inactive.
 From the other side of the fence the monitoring system which is simple doing ICMP every once in awhile detects that host is down. There are no connectivity problems in some occasions when I manually check.
 In some other instances the ESXi web UI is inaccessible, I've experienced myself a duplicate IP caused by one of my computers that took the exact reserved IP address which belongs to that ESXi.
 My question is simple. Is this a normal practice to heavily rely on DHCP reservations to manage mission critical servers IP addressing? My personal bias to decimate that configuration. Go back to traditional static IP addressing, pushing the DHCP range to leave room for server addressing.
 On what scenarios a DHCP reservation would make sense to keep when dealing with servers that run network services that should be available to employees.

But it's the data bit that I'm trying to work out at the moment. I will also have 2 other backups of my data, one on an external drive and one in the cloud. But I was wondering if I can update my OS without moving any data.
 I want to create a bootable partition in RAID 1 across x2 NVMe or SSD drives for the OS and have all my data on x4 High Capacity 7200RPM drives in a RAID 10 btrfs partition. That way, in theory, I can install a new OS, log in and have all my data still there on the other partition. Is this right/possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, hoping to get some pointers on a planned SharePoint migration. Mainly around Teams setup as each site will likely be Teams enabled.
 I understand there are varying degrees of complexity depending on depth of Teams integration but have narrowed it down to 3 options.
  
Setup each department with their own site and dump folders alongside General. No private channels at this stage but, if setup down the line, there'll be nothing in General for users who are added (I understand the new Shared Channel option fixes this but seems fine to just keep everything alongside General anyway. Users can't delete the General folder but can delete the contents).
 Setup one site and create Private channels for the various departments. Easier to manage from a permissions standpoint as we can delegate channel owners to add and remove members. Downside is limit on number of private channels per team (will probably be under that though). I can map private channels to File Explorer but the name doubles-up (can fix this by customising the desktop.ini file).
 Let SharePoint migration tool dump everything to one site and call it a day. Deal with permission changes as needed.
  
Also keen on references to other guides or scripts for checking file conflicts outside of the SharePoint migration tool. Been trying to research best practices for a while but the info keeps changing since the platform keeps evolving. Also saw a guide about using metadata rather than folders so they're accessible from more than one location but that seems like even more work/complexity.
 TIA

 What I have done in this case is install the WeChat UWP app from the Microsoft Store to at least limit it's access because UWP Microsoft Store apps are supposed to be Sandboxed.
 What has now happened is that the UWP app has been pulled from the Microsoft Store and the only one in there now is one which requires "Uses all system resources" and then prompts for Admin rights upon install just for good measure.
 I tried to outsmart them by using the wechat web app https://web.wechat.com/ and this worked for a while too. But now what happens is that when the user scans the code it then takes them a page which says that they need to install the Desktop app instead.
 This has been a blessing because now I have the justification to completely remove it from the computer and have it stay on their personal phones, under the threat of hijacking the entire computer.
 I just wanted to give others the heads up of what's going on.
 And also, to call out Microsoft for even allowing such malicious activity to occur in the Windows Store, when the original intent was to have every app Sandboxed except by special permission of having the app verified by them, which obviously they have not done by allowing an app like this to have full permissions and request admin rights to the whole system.

 I have an R740 Dell PowerEdge server with dual port 10GB Broadcom NetExtreme SFP+ Ethernet network daughter card where I've plugged in a SFP+ single mode fiber 10GB LR transceiver, brand name 10gtek part# ‎AXS13-192-10-Cisco2. I have connected a single mode fiber optic cable there and the other end on a quantum scalar library tape drive 8GB fibre channel connection(no transceiver needed there) but i see no link light status on R740's NIC. I performed a loopback test on the dual R740 SFP+ ports by connecting them to each other with same type transceivers of course and got green link lights. I'm not sure what to make of all this or where the incompatibility lies between all new equipment and accessories. The OS is Windows Svr 2019 and has all and the latest drivers. I'm certain the system doesn't have a fiber channel HBA as it utilizing the NDC card described. One of the SFP+ NIC port on the same card has an cat 7 ethernet cable connected also by transceiver and has no issues, status lights are green. I've tried swapping the ports I'm connecting the fiber but no luck. I'm very new with this type of networking and hoping someone more experienced can point out the obvious. Dell support says their hardware has no issues based on logs.
 I see someone here with a similar issue but their solution hasn't worked for me. https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/R740-Fiber-Module-issue/td-p/6089505

 We use them as a primary router that we sell as part of our WAN service offering, and the only real requirements we have are that it needs to support up to a 1gbps connection, support LTE and vDSL.
 We've been eyeing off the Cisco 900 series, but we're open to other options as we're quite flexible with what we go with.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on other models we could go with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All -
 I've been in the field for ~15 years now going through customers, VAR, and vendor life. I'm very well compensated and generally don't hate work.
 However, I'm very close to becoming Financially Independent (FI) /r/financialindependence/. I don't really feel like stopping work, but I'd sure love to not work full time. For someone who is CCIE level of skill what type of part-time opportunities might there be?
 I'm open to true PT or maybe working FT 6 months a year, maybe doing a contract part of the year then not working the other half. I was debating trying to reach out to some recruiters in my network to see if they get those types of opportunities'. I also considered teaching, but honestly it doesn't excite me a ton.
 Whatever I do I'd like to be able to take large chunks of time off to travel (2-3 months a year) and some decent PTO otherwise to enjoy time with my family.
 What options might you suggest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to setup LLDP on my Cisco 9300 switches to allow my Poly phones to determine their location for E911 on Zoom. I have only used CDP, and with the voice vlan, the phones figure out what vlan they need to be, and life's great. But, when I try to dial 933 to verify the more granular E911 location, it can't seem to sort out the MAC address of the switch it's connected to so it can be more precise.
 So far, I ran lldp run on the switch, and it seems to now be on. If I run show lldp neighbors, I get all the phones, APs, and other junk on the switch. But, the phone still doesn't seem to know what's going on. Running LDWin on a client machine to read the LLDP packets doesn't yield any results either. Either I'm getting erroneous results, or LLDP isn't configured correctly.
 Looking at the Cisco documentation, it looks like I may need to run lldp transmit and lldp receive on the specific interfaces, but that hasn't gotten me anywhere either. Oddly enough, the commands do not error out, but if I show the running config for the interface, those commands don't show up in the config. At the bottom of the post is the current interface config.
 I'm certain I'm missing something simple and obvious, but this is kicking my butt.
 Port config:
 switchport access vlan 10 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 90 authentication event fail action authorize vlan 64 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan 64 authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 64 authentication event server alive action reinitialize authentication host-mode multi-domain authentication port-control auto authentication periodic authentication violation replace mab dot1x pae authenticator dot1x timeout quiet-period 15 dot1x timeout tx-period 10 spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in IT for over 15 years, but new to sharepoint. I hate it with the darkest passion. Here's an example why. 
 User calls and wants a way to let 3 people edit an excel file at once. They also want to share it with mobile users as read only. (Its a schedule of sorts). No problem, this sounds like a problem for sharepoint!
 So, you create a new sharepoint site. You set yourself as the the owner, because your the IT admin, that's why. Now you go to your sharepoint sites list. Its not there, under recent or favorites. Why, b/c its new! But your the owner. Tough. 
 So you go back to admin and find the the URL. Now you want to set security permissions. Oh look, Microsoft created groups already, in O365. But I want to use my existing AD groups. Tough, we created groups and REALLY want you…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just asking because I’m amazed of the numbers of MSPs/Integrators who ask TAC to support them in a remote session during a device upgrade or because they need to finish the configuration of a device in live network (LAN specifically). For me it’s completely not their role. So is it common for constructors’ TAC (Cisco, HP, Aruba, Palo Alto, Extreme, etc…) to fulfill that role ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've searched other threads for good answers but was unable to find much.
 Recently a few of the techs I manage have received those "You're IT you should know this" comments from users for software such as Excel or certain Adobe CC applications. We purchase the licensing for most applications as well as install them and troubleshoot basic issues but we are not familiar with the daily use of the applications.
 ​
 What is a diplomatic way of responding to these comments? They often come from people in C-level/executive positions.
