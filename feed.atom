 Simple domain, server 2016 Standard, about 70 Win10's (Pro) - they want bitlocker enabled on all of them (including the DC?) and are spread around several locations (hence why I'd like this to be silent)
 What is the best way to do this now? I've read that they have taken away the silent-option for non-enterprise editions and I see several PS-scripts on spiceworks and whatnot, but I don't know which one is the best one to use.
 And while we're at it, is storing the keys in AD the most safe/reliable approach? (Haven't done that before.)
 Thanks in advance! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to reasons such as a better overview and security I'm planning on having two seperate systems.
 One for games and stuff, where for example it can't be outruled that from time to time something like a mod gets downloaded from a less trustworthy website. The other one shall be for working and for important as well as sensitive data.
 Windows will run on both.
 But how do I seperate these systems? From what I've read, dual boot doesn't really increase safety: If maleware makes it onto one system, it's likely to infect all connected partitions and hard drives.
 Does using BitLocker for the respective partitions/hard drives improve security?
 Switches for 2.5" and 3.5" sata-drives exist, but I'd rather not downgrade from my currently used M.2-ssd.
 Is there any other option than using two seperate computers? How do you handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently running three Windows Server VM's for a small business running some accounting software. Two of them are D4s v3's (4 vCPU + 16GiB RAM), and the last is a B2s (2 vCPU + 4 GiB RAM). There's a reservation in place which brings the monthly bill to approximately C$650 (US$476). This is getting a bit too expensive, especially considering that we'd like to add another VM. From looking at the bill, it seems that the main cost is the Windows Server VM License cost. Aside from the cost, the setup is optimal for the owner of the business as all of the employees can login at once (2 max per VM) and the work is synced through the use of SyncThing.
 ​
 Is there a recommended alternative that we can switch to? Or is this license cost going to exist everywhere? I've looked into it and saw that big names such as GCP have similar price ranges, whereas relatively unknown companies like Kamatera have cheaper prices. I'd appreciate any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading a networking book and I'm stuck on a sentence that suggests a circuit switched network divides its transmission rate depending on the number of connections/circuits. Why does a connection get a fraction of the transmission capacity? This makes no sense to me.
 In the TDM, you're switching between circuits, but the speed of the link doesn't go down based on the number of active circuits. But I guess you could argue that the transmission rate is reduced since you're not sending data when the circuit switched from you to others, so it's a if the network is slower, but when you're sending data, you're sending it at full speed possible by the link. But I don't understand why a 1Mbps link is quartered to 250kbps if there are 4 circuits? Or is this saying the same thing I said, it's a if the link speed is reduced?
 In the FDM, this makes completely no sense to me. You're dividing the spectrum, but you're sending stuff in parallel and at full speed just with its own bandwidth. No?

 ​
 I have been working for one year at a company in the medical production business and the business has been growing rapidly for the past years. Last year we doubled in size and now we are about 100 users.
 ​
 I used to be working at a MSP as a consultant doing it all (from fixing printers to setting up servers). Im not great at anything but i have a broad knowlage base to stand on. I worked for this customer and they hired me as a IT-Manager last year. I am currently alone doing everything IT-related for the business.
 ​
 Now they want me to present a 5 year roadmap for IT and as this is a first for me i wanted to get your feedback on whats important to add to the presentation?
 ​
 My first thoughts are 
  
IT-Security withing the company and how to educate users (its almost non existant, before me there was no MFA, no general knowlage about security, no password on the company wifi etc).
 How to reduce costs
 Documentation
 Going Cloud (started to tamper with intune for easier computer management)
  
​
 Everything is helpful :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are starting up Duo in our enterprise. We rely on Google's Single Sign-on to be used with a service already for most of our users. So we use the Third-Party SSO Profile for that service. However a portion of users need to use MFA.
 To do this I set up Generic SAML Service Provider - Single Sign-On, and applied it to the OU where the users will be. On Google's side, I also set "Have Google Prompt for their username" on the SSO Profile assignment. If I use "Require users to enter their Google Username", it doesn't prompt for MFA. 
 When signing into Google, I get a typical Google login page. After putting in the username, it then dumps me to Duo's login page, prompting me to put the username in again. 
 Is there any way I can change that behavior so that Google passes the account name to Duo so my users don't have to type the username in twice?

 How would one go about or how would you investigate to see if your internet connection is enough for your users? meaning if X amount of jitter, X amount of ping latency is enough or needs improvement and what not.

 Here's a bit of a confusing situation for me. I'm working with a pair of Cisco Nexus 3048-TPs running software version version 6.0(2)U2(2) which were given to me, and I'm attempting to configure the switches with a handful of SVIs, and with RIPv2 for the dynamic routing protocol (it's a lab environment, don't worry). I'm having issues with the behavior of the SVIs / L3 functionality on the switches.
 To start, let's assume SVI #1 is for VLAN10 with the subnet 192.168.10.0/25 and the SVI has the IP address 192.168.10.1/25 and lives on Switch #1, and SVI #2 is for VLAN11 with the subnet 192.168.10.128.0/25 with the SVI having the IP address 192.168.10.129/25 living on Switch #2. RIPv2 is used to distribute routes for these subnets across the network. I also have a router at 10.1.0.1…]]></summary>

However, the location where this fiber and media converter are located only has one network cable in that area which services some other equipment already. The simplest solution to pipe the internet connection to the router and firewall (on another level) would be to comingle the unsecured, unfirewalled internet connection on VLAN 35 with the rest of the LAN (that currently doesn't use VLANs) on that one single cable. However, that seems counter intuitive. Usually I would prefer to physically have the router/firewall between the internet and the rest of the LAN, and not just virtually. Can VLANs be trusted to virtually separate the internet from the rest of the LAN? Or am I asking for trouble?

However, it seems to me that using udp instead of udp, would increase the speed of downloads substantially. For instance, if your ping is 100ms and your windows size is 32KB, then you are limited to 2.4Mbps to wait for the ack packet to come back. If you don't have to wait for the ack packet, couldn't you get the full network speed download of 1gbps (assuming that is what you pay for and the server also pays for that upload). That is a huge difference in bandwidth. Am I missing something?

 Two scenarios:
  
Area1 > Area0 > Area2 > Area1: Area 1 and 2 have direct connectivity using an ABR. Will Area 1 routes be advertised into Area 2 through the common ABR? If yes, will it cause any routing loop? If No, How will OSPF avoid the loop?
 Area 1 > Area 2 using two ABRs. There is no Area 0. Will the routes be advertised between Areas? If yes, will it cause routing Loops? If No, how will OSPF prevent the loop?
  
I know Inter Area OSPF works like Distance vector (As per many answers i found on other posts), but still not clear how OSPF avoids loops in above scenarios.
 Thanks.

 If I get a message reported from users that has a PDF for a Norton renewal (among many other things,) I don't even have to look to know that it came from a randomly generated Gmail account. I'm freaking sick of it and Barracuda is doing a crap job of finding them. Of course, I can't just outright block all of Gmail as much as I'd like to do so.
 This sucks.

I manage 3 sites so consolidating and automating management is ideal.
 I see Ansible looks to have collections for each and they both have python SDKs. Both of those tools I would like to use and learn more of. Maybe a preference of python but I could imagine how Ansible could be better for the job.
 Any suggestions? Other tools to use? Personal experiences? Bummed we leverage Meraki but it is what it is.

But here's the funny part, this is how they got introduced to OpenSUSE (they were a Ubuntu server room before this).
 https://youtu.be/SYRlTISvjww - Uptime Funk 
 A parody song basically introduced the IT staff to OpenSUSE. They did some digging and eventually completely migrated to OpenSUSE back in 2018. This song is basically the IT department's theme song. Thought I'd share this little fun bit from my day working with a really cool group of IT folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello gents,
 you may find this a funny story, but I started recently to work for a data center provider in Europe. Initially, we were not carrier neutral so we had been trying to resell the internet traffic we purchased from tier 1-2 carriers to our clients as our own service. I mean it works well, as long as the customers aren't the smartest ones and are ready to pay for it. 
 As I am one of the most experienced guys when it comes to carrier network (even thought I am in telco and carrier sales for more than 15 years) they now asking me to develop and establish 2 new products.
  
Become a carrier neutral DC
 Develope a Business Plan for a IP transit product
  
Regarding the first task.
 I am fine with it, as this had been my key business my entire career. The challenge is: They want me to offer these services (carrier neutral) only to the new clients, but not to the existing ones. So they want carriers to join, but will not allow them to approach existing customers, which is nonsense. IMHO. Why should carriers join us if they are not able to do their business and with whom? I need to write a business plan for that and maybe anybody has any kind of templates or something I can use, I would really appreciate it. 
 Regarding the IP Transit Product.
 I need to write a business plan and present it - even though, again, I am not a product designer nor manager, I used to be sales all my 15 years in DC Business. But that's ok, I don't have any choice. So any plans how I can start? 
 Thanks in advance...
 PS: Sorry English is my 3rd language

The primary reason is that we’re a hardware startup and we want to give people a way to work on the platform without mailing prototype boards around the country. We do have an office and a lot of people do come in a few days a week as well, so we want most of them to have a dedicated area. We were thinking about using static IP’s and Guacamole RDS to accomplish this. Is this a terrible idea? We’re just trying to figure out a way to standardize our builds but not have to worry about laptops with code and PII on them disappearing or if someone’s got a hardware prototype that gets stolen.

 "Authentication failed for EAP method type 13. The error was 0x80090331."
 GoogleFu says that error is something like "The client and server cannot communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm."
 Wireshark packet captures of the EAP conversation show the client sending its list of ciphers it supports in the Client-Hello, and then the Server-Hello coming back using one of those ciphers. But the Windows 10 host stops responding and simply says it could not connect when using the smartcard.
 The same host works fine when using the computer certificate and the cipher exchange looks the same in that case.
 Is there a deeper/better way to get Windows to show me more information so I can figure out what cipher mismatch it thinks it has ? Has anyone seen this error before for EAP-TLS ?

 Framework laptop looks like an interesting option but for that price for such a short warranty I'm concerned that it may not be the laptop that lasts me the next 10 years. But I love the idea of being able to upgrade laptops the way I have my desktop.
 Then there are the HP/Dell powerhouses where the cost of ram/storage is stupid and is not replaceable or upgradeable.
 What would you choose for your next 10 year laptop today?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a lot of responsibilities besides being a sysadmin. And, like a lot of you I imagine, I’m responsible for the care and feeding of things in a lot of different domains. Some of those domains I have a lot of experience in, some not so much. 
 Because I don’t have the resources or bandwidth to research and test ALL updates for example, I rely on the vendor (or trusted third party) to tell me how critical a vulnerability is to know how soon it needs to be patched. MSFT says there’s a domain controller vulnerability, deploy it to one DC today, the rest tomorrow. I generally don’t try to do an analysis to determine for each vulnerability or update how susceptible we might be. I know I can get burned this way, but I rather risk getting burned by a patch than leaving a known vulnerability in place. I do check reddit to see if a patch Tuesday is particularly rough. Standing on the shoulders of giants if you will.
 I kind of apply this same rule in other domains where I have found best practice dashboards. I know that it won’t find all the problems, but I’m hoping it will at least help us avoid the most common pitfalls.
 Here are some that I use: * AWS - Security Hub, Trusted Advisor * Azure - Advisor * Office 365 - Security checklists (forgot name?) * Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Security Score * Crowdstrike - Spotlight * Custom Dashboards - Grafana, Graylog, misc
 What tools do you use? Does anyone have a great tool for AD/GPO tuneups?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Network+ certification and I'm reading Mike Meyers' Network+ 8th edition exam guide. I'm currently in the last chapter on Network Troubleshooting, on the section ipconfig/ifconfig/ip. He shows an example of the macOS/UNIX ifconfig output, and on the inet line it says:
  
inet 192.168.4.78 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.4.255 
  
I'm just wondering why does the netmask show in hex and not dotted decimal or CIDR notation? Wouldn't it normally be written as 255.255.255.0 or /24? 
 This seems to be specific to the ifconfig output, as ipconfig shows the subnet mask with dotted decimal notation, and ip shows CIDR notation. This is the first time I've even seen a hex netmask, as literally the rest of the book has used dotted decimal or CIDR notation. Even in my limited real world experience troubleshooting computers and networks, I've never seen a hex netmask.
 I've tried Googling the answer, but most of what I found was just decimal to hexadecimal conversion charts, or talking about hexadecimal in a general sense not really networking focused. From what I read I think it might just be a remnant of the early mainframes and UNIX systems, and the language they ran on. But I can't find anything definitive about it. 
 I don't think it ultimately matters what notation the subnet/netmask are written in, but I am I wrong is there some system out there where I'll need to know how to convert binary to hex for subnetting?

 The company I work for currently uses signature based Symantec AV. Now, we are looking to change to another product.
 The question is, in this ransomware world, is it necessary now to get an EDR tool as well? I wonder how necessary is it? Big companies like Solarwinds, got hacked and they supposedly would have have all the EPP/EDR tools at endpoint. I wondered the effectiveness of these tools.
 Should we just stick to the usual AV or just really look for EDR?
 Please also suggest some of the best tools out there,

 I am working to start a small rural ISP and am trying to better understanding of carrier scale routing. My background is in the physical infrastructure side, and I would like to have a good quality rough draft before we start .
 ​
 https://imgur.com/a/yRteSjS is the diagram I'm working with. The use case is, we have 10 small communities where we'd like to provide FTTH.
  
We will have two edge facilities. Each edge has 3 routers.
 Each community distribution site will have a link back to each edge facility. The pair of routers at a community will be in VRRP (or HSRP if the router has it).
 The goal is to be a native IPv6 environment. We will have one ASN.
  
Can eBGP, iBGP, and/or OSPF be used to implement a multi-home multi-path load shared environment as diagrammed?
 Given we will be IPv6 native, what would the best practice be for handling IPv4 bound traffic in this environment?
 ​

The users running the application just start clicking through and it brings it out of the validated state and breaks things and I have to log in and change everything back.
 How do I tell windows I want updates, but I don't want any default app, account, or other major changes? Seems like there should be a way to do this, but I am not finding anything good so far.

 So my wife is a database developer and she knows SQL like a second langue. She can whip insane queries in minutes that would take me days to build (and still be kind of shitty). Anyway, I don't do this often but once in a while I'm stuck on something and just holler at her like "hey, babe can you check this syntax is OK" or I'm sitting there and she comes in to see what I'm doing and we end up going over one. It goes the other way also, there have been quite a few times we are staring at her screen chewing over a problem.
 To me, it's not a big deal, it's fun sitting together and figuring out a problem (sometimes we end up spending the evening "watching Netflix"), and besides, we both benefit from the money I make from the job.
 But to be clear we never sit in the same room when we are working from home. There's a fine line between spending too much time with your spouse. lol

 Today, my team was involved and managed to identify the maximum body size that could be used in that Dev Server: 1.35KB (I was in awe). More than that, timeout.
 I then involved the network team, no issues. Checked Firewall, no issues. Checked VMware, no issues either. So I decided to test the Webservice from other servers (using Invoke-WebRequest) within the same site: worked. Test the WS in the same VLAN: worked. 
 Narrowed to the same dev server. There was no error log, no other issues.
 So I asked. "Hey, have you tried rebooting the server today or in the last few weeks?" (this is a dev server, so one of them have that privilege). "No".
 Rebooted the server. 
 WS now worked properly.

 The share being sync'd exists on its own drive on each server, so data compared on the drives would be 1:1. 
 Data as it exists on Server A (parent share) 1.6TB used (402 GB free on the drive). A few days into replication now and I have had to expand the drive 3 times now on Server B, as it has completely filled up its first allocation of 2TB far exceeding the 1.6TB of data it should be getting.
 DFSRprivate does exist within the the share, however the staging area was allotted 40GB and conflict/deletion area 20GB. So if factoring in that space, there is no way (that I am aware of) for that area to contribute to the extra 600 GB (and counting) of data making it's way onto Server B during this replication. Windirstat also confirms only ~40GB of date in there.
 Curious if anyone out there has seen this behavior before, is this common, something I messed up? Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Help with network setup for small business
 Hello,
 I am a software engineer but I don’t know a lot about networking hardware. I would like to have an idea of what needs to be done to setup a network on a 3 floor building for a small business.
 There will be 26 computers connected through Ethernet (wiring is already in place), and approximately 50 concurrent wifi users, so I guess I’m going to need to place an access point on every floor for wifi.
 There is a small IT room, where I’ll place the router, switches, camera DVRs, etc… though currently I haven’t bought any of the hardware, just the Ethernet wiring from the IT room to the computers.
 Another thing I want to plan for is a possible internet failure, since internet connections in the area are very unreliable, I want a backup fiber connection in case the main one has problems.
 So basically I would really appreciate some guiding regarding a good setup for this. Budget is approximately $3000.
 Thanks in advance

 I'm a full-time student at Oregon Tech with a full-time job. I am set to graduate soon and need to do a Capstone project. OIT, for some bizarre reason, does not provide project sponsors to students and you are expected to find one in a span of about two weeks. Yes you read that right - you need to find a project sponsor with a Capstone-level project lying around for you to complete on top of managing your established work schedule (we're a commuter school). This is obviously insane and thankfully they offer the option to do a research project instead and write about your findings.
 My problem is... I don't really know what to research. Specifically, our project needs to bring to light a problem in the world and how we can apply our knowledge to fixing that problem. My focus for my degree was on Network and Systems Administration. I know how networking equipment/the internet works, how AD works, some basic programming, took several business courses, and learned a bit about cybersecurity along the way.
 My original project idea was how IoT implementation can benefit businesses and the security risks with IoT devices. My advisor doesn't really like this idea and insists that it won't be a big enough topic to fill 350 hours of work for the next year. I worry she may be right, but she doesn't seem to be giving me any usable project ideas. 
 Any idea what kind of research project could fit the bill? Something networking/security or business-adjacent would be highly preferable. Thanks for the help, and feel free to ask me whatever.

 Before I went live with them I had no issues with slow logins on SSH (like 2sec to get in after entering pw) and our observium was polling snmp without any issues. 
 Now however the sign-in takes 80-100sec and they stop to respond to snmp polls once every hour. The network however works 100% fine. If you ping any interface on it I don’t lose a single ping. Cpu hovers around 10% and memory around 40%. 
 Anyone experienced this issue before? I’m running the latest os10 10.5.4.3.

 Everything I am finding appears to be 1u appliances that are either compute or storage and meant to be scale out for VMware or nutanix. 
 I am sure there are small units out there, if anyone has any suggestions I would be most grateful 😃

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so I’ve got Server01 which is part of a replication group. I want to upgrade it to a version of Windows Server which won’t be EoS next year, I want to have minimal downtime and I don’t want to do an in-place upgrade. Also, there’s a lot of data. 
 So I’m wondering what the most efficient way of doing this is. In the past for smaller sites I’ve removed the old server from the replication group, stood up a new VM and added to the group, kicked off replication and waited. I don’t want to do that this time though due to the amount of data. 
 So do I stand up a new VM side-by-side with Server01, robocopy the data, then when I’m ready rename and change the IP of Server01 and put that IP and host name on the new VM? If this is best, do I need to exclude dfsrprivate?
 I’ve also considered adding the new VM to the replication group with a name like Server02 while Server01 is still in production. Then wait for replication to finish, then (overnight) rename, remove from group and power off Server01 and then rename Server02 ‘Server01’. I feel like that’s a bad idea but I need to hear someone say it!
 Or is there a better method that I haven’t considered yet? Any suggestions and/or help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an architecture question and was hoping one or some of you networking geniuses could help me out. 
 I am implementing an architecture where agnostic front ends will send backend requests to load balanced reverse proxies. The complication I am facing is that each backend is individual to an organization, so each backend will be spun up in its own environment (containers), but the routing BETWEEN the front end and the organization’s specific backend container is where I am having trouble. 
 The simple solution that comes to mind is to use a header and implement some sort of header-based lookup to obtain either IPs or DNS names to route to the correct upstream. I feel like there’s a million and one ways to do this but I feel like I’m missing the “right” (simple/robust/scalable) way to do it. 
 The goal will be to deploy agnostic front ends as needed based on load, and then auto deploy a backend/middleware-with-lookup-table/updated-proxy-config for each organization that joins. 
 Have any of you solved this type of routing issue? Am I missing something to simplify this process? Any help is appreciated!

 Over the span of a few weeks now I've been working towards improving our network efficiency and speed as it relates to a few Databases we have over two sites.
 The sites are connected over site to site vpn, thus the traversed traffic has a secuirty packet overhead, reducing the mtu available to 1438
 That number was found by doing ping -f [some-ip] -l 1400 then modifying the number to ensure there was no packet fragmentation, that number plus the 28 bit header gave me 1438, however not the point I just wanted to provide context.
 From there I investigated manipulating the MTU via GPO, I came up empty handed however knew there were other options... Option 26 to be presice.
 I added option 26 to our dhcp server, did a reboot on an end device, a forced release/renew, and the mtu ( checked with netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface showed the same default 1500
 from there I grabbed wireshark, grabbed a capture of the renewal, and the ack does show option 26 with the correct value.
 I've checked the logs within the client however there are no entries or evidence that windows knows what to do with this information.
 so, can you help me with a few questions: 1. why does windows not honour dhcp options, speicifcally option 26? and 2. how would you go about modifying the MTU for client devices?
 ty for taking the time and have a great weekend everyone :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would be very greatful if more knowledgeable members of this community would help me find some puzzling answers regarding proper disk benchmarking.
 Here is what I have gathered so far:
 High queue with small block size based on median of files stored on the server usually 16KB-128KB
 Random not sequential read/write depending on read write stats in my case usually 95/5 read/write for web files and 80/20 for database. 
 Fsync on, system memory (ram) cache disabled directly in apps used in my case database ( buffer in mysql disabled ), web server ( file logs disabled ), language parser (in case of php opcache file timestamps disabled, error log to file disabled ), any logging and monitoring apps disabled
 Block sector of disk during formatting anf filesystem is equal between tested drives.
 Fill system memory loaded to the 99% to make sure os especially linux doesn't use ram as cache for file operations. Swap file disabled.
 Also because duplicated files in linux are referenced not physically duplicated try to make unique files.
 Also always check extreme parameters like 100% read or write workload or test very small 1KB or 1GB to avoid lags when for example somebody decides to upload big file or put this file as a blob to the database. 
 Analyze data in a statistical manner. When parameters are gradually increased look for linear or logarithmic spread of the results to ensure disk performance is predictable
  
Is there anything more to know when benchmarking disks to choose the optimal one ?
 
I'm wondering if apps for automatic tests like webdriver io imitating concurrent users in not so random fashion should be used beside the usual fio and sysbench i use ?
 
I know that linux filesystem is little different due to points I mentioned earlier, is there anything else worth knowing in this subject which may affect the results of benchmark disk ?

Had him on the phone for about 10 minutes and said he didn’t need to be on the phone while I fix this so I would call him back. We hang up and I see him working on his computer (obviously I can’t work while he’s working). I message him twice - once on the app and again on Teams to say only one can work on the computer at a time - no response. An hour and a half passes before he says “sorry, let’s reschedule for tomorrow at 2”. I say fine and call him and 2PM the next day on Teams - rings once and stops. I figure he’s on a call and rejected my call or my call just didn’t go through so I message him - no answer. I was contemplating going upstairs to my main PC where my kid was (I was in the garage) but decided to stay to see if I could reach him. I call him again 10 minutes later and he says “meeting went over - 10 minutes?” This is when I hear my wife yelling my name because my baby fell from the bed about 2 and a half feet asking me if we should go to the hospital. The part that’s pissing me off is this end-user who #1 didn’t have the common sense or listen to me when I said I’m going to work on his PC and to leave his shit alone, #2 I’m trying to baby sit this end-user because he wasn’t courteous enough to give me a heads up that he was late earlier.

 First I would like to apologize for my English, I'm from Brazil and I'm using the translator.
 We currently use in the company Aruba Instant On for Switch, Unifi for Wireless. We are going to move to another building and with that came the opportunity to improve our infrastructure. Our company is considered average here in Brazil, we work with road infrastructure works and at the office we currently have 80 users with a tendency to grow. There are about 200 devices. Now are my doubts.
 In the above scenario, does Aruba's Instant On line still serve us or should we think about Aruba Enterprise? For wireless we intend to migrate to another company considering that Ubiquiti does not have support, which one should we consider for our case?

 We are fully cloud and a requirement has come up to implement unique logins for our WiFi & VPN. We are using Microsoft AAD as our identity provider. Plan is to also implement 2FA for our VPN by leveraging the AAD MFA extension for the NPS server.

 This is an example of a setup I have tried: https://i.imgur.com/8WPDA1G.png
 Since my default gateway is 192.168.0.1 I assigned a static IP address of 192.168.0.201 (I have also tried various other numbers on the last octet in case it was some weird conflict issue, as well as typing exactly what he did in case I was missing something) but upon validating my network settings I get this:

 There are some who are just running into this because they haven't enabled modern authentication on a tenant. If you have found yourself in that situation; I hope this may be of help to you.
 I may have missed it in documentation, but the following were not obvious to me as a newbie to oauth2, and didn't come up in the searches of the forums:
 You do need to have ssl enabled bindings
 While the redirect URL does not have to be publicly resolvable, using loopback fails on machines other than the server itself for obvious reasons. To use a non-loopback URL, ssl must be enabled. Self signed works.
 There are two separate Microsoft guides on osTicket's site, one for SSO (portal) and the other to enable an email fetch. It is easy to confuse the two via search terms.
 Good luck.

 I am the sole network engineer and am making changes left and right to get things up to speed from the prior self-proclaimed engineer.
 We have not been impressed with their support or their implementation of SDWAN. It is legitimately just FortiGates following Fortinets MSP cookbook examples with a few changes. An insane amount of money for something I can do on my own faster, better and more reliably. 
 They use FortiManager and RestAPI Admins to pull analytics into their dashboard. We could get our own appliance for FMG and FAZ to accomplish this. 
 Why does this feel like a product designed for organizations without a dedicated network engineer? Am I missing the value here? Please, help me understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to copy from a eSATA enclosure holding a 4TB HDD with some (okay, more than some, ALOT) bad sectors. I've tried running a check disk but it never completes, I've resorted to trying to robocopy everything off of it using the command;
 robocopy 4TBDRIVE:\ \\NETWORKLOCATION\SAN /MT:1 /r:0 /w:0 
 I've been able to get some files off, but robocopy keeps getting stuck on certain files, obviously ones with bad sectors. I haven't figured out a way to get it to skip these and move onto the next if the percent copied doesn't move in say 1 minute ... it just sits there forever, until I stop the copy, go into the disk, delete the file and start all over. There is about 2000 files I need to copy off so I am hoping that there is a better way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-domain-joins-may-fail-after-october-updates/
 Has anyone seen issues since the October updates?
  
"Because of these additional protections, domain join operations are intentionally prevented from re-using an existing computer account in the target domain.Domain join operations will be blocked automatically after installing the October 2022 security updates on client computers due to additional security checks before re-using an existing computer account (the changes do not affect new accounts).
  
I assume since most people's "golden" images are a little older (e.g. most recent updates aren't slipstreamed), and most domain-join operations occur during imaging before the OS is patched, this might be going under the radar.
 More from the article:
  
This happens unless the user attempting to join the domain does not have the appropriate write permissions (i.e., the user is the creator of the existing account or the computer was created by a domain administrator).Microsoft explained that domain join processes might intentionally fail with "0xaac (2732): NERR_AccountReuseBlockedByPolicy" errors saying that "An account with the same name exists in Active Directory. Re-using the account was blocked by security policy.""Affected scenarios include some domain join or re-imaging operations where a computer account was created or pre-staged by a different identity than the identity used to join or re-join the computer to the domain."
  
Hopefully this isn't as dastardly as it sounds...?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently began a new job at a company of 350+ employees with what seems to me to be an exceptionally large infrastructure for what the company is and its size. Perhaps I'm just very green, but we have about 300 production servers with all the apps and services that run on them coming to about 500+.
 I'm a new Sysadmin straight out of college with some internship experience and a little bit of freelance as well as personal home-lab setup. However, I'm a little overwhelmed by the size of what I'm getting into with this job. I'm very excited, but I am unsure on how to best go about just getting an understanding and layout of the IT infrastructure. My team is about 3 including myself and while they are happy to answer questions, it's unreasonable to ask them to sit-down and talk me through each server and what it does. 
 Do others have any tips, tricks or suggestions on how to just familiarize myself with the infrastructure?
 I've been given the job of building out a Zabbix server for monitoring purposes and that seems to be a really good way to start as it will force me to become familiar with everything. However,it is also hard to figure out what to monitor and how best to setup useful alerts if I don't know the infrastructure.

 I just tried attaching a visio, but /r networking wont allow images?
 I'm planning out architecture for SD wan mesh behind 2 BGP routers and after going through the documentation and videos; I really can't figure out a way to define two different paths out of the network coming from a singular /24. Typically you'd create your sdwan interfaces and prefer one etc, but i only have one interface.
 Can't do anything tricky with private IP space due to port-forwarding/ipsec and overall firewalling. Im thinking im going to need to re-configure the OUTSIDE interfaces with BGP and get rid of the route redistribution down to EIGRP. But even if I do; i still only have one interfaces
 Architecture
 2 Edge routers bgp peered between each other, distro'd EIGRP down to the firewalls (going to migrate to ospf cuz fortigate). 
 Hoping to get SD Wan set up to pipe critical org traffic out primary ISP and youtube/fb out the secondary ISP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently reminded that not everyone learns FC troubleshooting in their sysadmin careers. I thought I'd post this here for future reference in case someone needs.
 The guy that taught me everything fibre channel gave me a list and order of troubleshooting steps. I have tried to reconstruct them here. As this was 10 years ago, it may not be 100% what he said, but I think it's pretty close.
 troubleshooting FC:
  
host (initiator) HBA driver
 host HBA status
 switch port for initiator
 cabling to initiator
 zoning connecting the initiator to target
 cabling to target
 port on target
 LUN to port mapping
 port security
  
Start with 1 and go to 9, for all things able to be checked remotely first, then check physical. 3-7 can be checked partially with one step, checking the switch to make sure they show links. This excludes 90% of issues. Leave checking the physical cabling and SFPs until all others are excluded. So, troubleshooting order should be 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 3/4, 6/7
 May it be useful to someone, someday.

I recently tested a 48 port switch with all ports connected but with no traffic and saw a decrease in actual power consumption in the switch of ~15%. It was measured with an external current clamp meter, so pretty exact readings and not what the switch measured. 15% is not massive and when traffic actually starts to flow, that will decrease of course. What kind of accumulated savings do you see in your network?
 Have you seen problems with it? Why is it not the default settings if it has no adverse effects?

 We go through quite a lot of headsets and bought a load of Manhattan USB headsets from our regular supplier.
 We also use sophos endpoint and use it’s usb device protection features, most devices are blocked unless we allow them.
 Storage devices are certainly heavily restricted, so strangely, we found new, out of the packet headsets, that are being blocked because they have storage in them.
 Tested on a machine that is isolated from the network and doesn’t have sophos on it, and found that it does indeed show a storage device, but doesn’t show up any drive.
 My first thought is that it’s a small batch of devices that may have been tampered with and is collecting audio. Which if it’s the case, is very bad.
 But if it’s not, what is it for, considering other “identical” model devices from the same order don’t have it at all.
 What can I do to try and figure it out, or should I just bring it up with the supplier/Manhattan?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are using M365 for email hosting with our MX records pointing to Mimecast as our primary email security solution. In recent months we have noticed more phishing emails being allowed through Mimecast and delivered to our users. We have very little in the way of EOP policies in place, our original thinking being that Mimecast is our email security layer in the first instance, not EOP. We're now thinking about enabling the policies in EOP to act as a second line of defence. We've even noticed genuine phishing emails that have come through Mimecast to then be flagged as phishing by EOP, but delivered to user mailboxes due to our EOP Anti-spam -> Connection filter policy that has all the Mimecast IPs within it, which then bypasses the majority of checks. Not good!
 Is anyone here running in this manner with Mimecast and EOP or indeed another security product sat in front of EOP? I'd be interested to hear how your EOP policies are configured, with regards to:
  
Anti-phishing
 Anti-spam
 Enhanced filtering
 Safe Links (Minecast vs EOP - We're using Mimecast, which as I understand is a retrospective check of URLs when a user clicks)
  
Are your users OK with having multiple places to check for quarantined/junk emails? e.g. 1st line product (Mimecast in our case), Microsoft and Junk folder in Outlook.
 Are we attacking this in the wrong way and should be focusing on tightening up Mimecast rather than looking at EOP?
 Thanks in advance!

 Anyone else getting fed up with being asked to handle shit outside your scope while also being bugged and blamed for things not going as fast as everyone wants.
 Post COVID I have noticed a ridiculous increase in wait times for everything. Examples
  
Moved our shop to a wireless long range AP solution to share internet with main office (building is close) to cut down on our overall internet costs. AP equipment from CISCO took literally 6 months to get. Pushed back demolition of building near the shop as our Fuel Management Pump System is there and would be cut off from internet before AP installed if we demo'd 
 AC in shop storage room went out. Was asked for some reason to handle it so contacted and scheduled the recommended person boss wanted to use and it's taken them a week to finally come out but shop manager sends me repeated emails on when this is going to get done.
 Anytime I order equipment needed outside the basics it takes a week or even two to arrive. Bosses complain every time saying it should be 2 days tops like everything is Amazon.
 All Vendors I deal with lately whether its security system maintenance or door fixes/AC are behind in work and take days to show up sometimes. Again... bosses whine about it and get aggravated. 
  
Question is, anyone else notice this trend getting worse? Especially an escalation in impatience lately?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have made this question roughly a couple of years ago and people have commented that it is still worth pursuing it.
 I want to ask it again today: Do you think that someone should spend their time learning CCIE? I think learning cloud/automation/DevOps is far more relevant nowadays than the CCIE.
 This is excluding Cisco shops of course, where they need certified engineers to hold their status.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to replace a switch in our IDF cabinet (1 for now, a dozen more to come) and open to moving to a new brand. I have been loyal to Cisco for years but I don't want to deal with subscription plans or complicated licenses on their new models. 
 We only need 24 ports (needs to be POE for access points) and will connect back to our core switches via 10GB fiber. 48 would still be fine if cost weren't 2X a 24 port model. It would be going into an IDF cabinet that is in our warehouse, which is full of dust, so it needs to be something that can tolerate the environment.
 I know Arista has been up & coming but I don't know which model(s) would be a good fit.
 What else would you be considering?

 We're looking to create a GPO, or whatever is applicable, to automatically switch client machines to our public WiFi in the event the private network is down. Is there a way to store the public WiFi credentials and ensure that the machine only uses this as a failover -- i.e. it will always prioritize the private network when available? Thanks for any insight.

 just a quick question as I'm really unsure and maybe somebody could help me out on this one :D
 How would I have to license RDS when using multiple RDS servers where those servers are NOT redundant but rather server A serves use-case A and reaches VLAN A whereas server B is used for a totally different use-case (and another pool of users)?
 Can they both share a single RDS user CAL-pool? Would I have to have multiple RDS CAL pools (and license servers)?
 Or am I totally wrong on everything? :D
 Thanks. Much appreciated :)

 “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I had a candidate interviewing not long so ago and after reading their resume noticed they listed dump sites as one of their study materials. 
 This person had a ton of certs and had that they were current slated to take another one and had next to it listed that they are studying with pass4sure. 
 Basically “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I was super interested in interviewing this person mainly to ask wtf but unfortunately HR killed it after everyone brought it up. 
 A few colleagues basically said well if they still know their stuff what does it matter and basically work smarter not harder but obviously in a half joking sort of way. My opinion has always been cheating degrades everyone and worse yet forced those making exams to write worse and worse questions. 
 So would you hire someone that listed this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 the company I work for sells document management software and recently some of our clients started asking if we have a "customer portal" so they can provide their documents to their end customers. 
 Our DMS solution does not provide this functionality yet, so I am looking to either buy/integrage & adapt a third party solution or build our own. (classic make or buy decision)
 ​
 Now I am currently in the phase to check/analyse what is available out in the wild that we could probably integrate so we don't have to re-invent the wheel. 
 This is why I am asking for your suggestions/recommendations of software/platforms that I might wanna have a look at. 
 ​
 Our clients who use our document management system want to be able to provide a selection of documents via a "portal" to their customers. Their customers might be other businesses or private people. For example a bank that wants to provide the bank statements to their customers via such portal. Or a construction company that wants to provide technical drawings to their contractors. etc. 
 ​
 The basic use case is more or less the same, though the industry varies. 
 ​
 The platform would sit in between the consumer of the documents and our document management system. 
 Most likely the communication between the platform and the DMS should be via REST API's.
 ​
 Do you know of any solution that might cover the basic or advanced requirements of such a "portal" ?
 ​
 I'm also considering building something with the M365 platform (PowerApps, Azure Functions, PowerAutomate, etc.)
 ​
 One of the solutions I'll be looking at will be https://www.deepbox.swiss/en/overview/
 ​
 Any ideas/suggestions are welcome!

 Doing routine checks of our sign in logs.
 We have this week a user who's account is registering a sign in, non mfa (single authentication - previously satisfied) every 3 to 5 minutes.
 The service is;
 Microsoft Teams Web Client - Skype Presence Service 
 ​
 Doing an audit does not show Teams signing in.. Can anyone shed any light as to what this is? We don't use Skype, use Teams of course.. is this just the agent having issues or?
 Only one user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently read this thing called "Cyber Signals" - a new publication from Microsoft. These numbers made my skin itch, they seem so cheap! 
 🧑‍💻 Attacker for hire: Prices start at $250 per job 🧑‍💻
 🪲 Ransomware SaaS kit: $40 per month 🪲
 💻 Compromised PC: $0.13-$0.89 💻
 🔑 Stolen Credentials: $150 for 400 million (!!!!) 🔑
 🕵️ Spearphishing for hire: $100-$1000 per successful account 🕵️ 
 So for less than the cost of your weekly shopping, you can buy a Ransomware SaaS kit (now so popular it has it's own name: RaaS). 
 For the price of your council tax, you can buy 400 million stolen credentials. 
 For the price of your energy bill this month, you can hire an attacker. 
 For somewhere around the price of your mortgage or rental payment, you could pay for a successful takeover of a highly targeted, important account within an organisation. 
 I was absolutely floored to learn how low some of these numbers are; especially the Spearphishing one. Okay, you have to know what to do with it afterward.. But even so, it's a crazy world we live in. 
 Remember; You have to defend perfectly every time, an attacker only has to get it right against you once. Protect yourself: do the basics, do them well: 
 🔒 Enable MFA
 💉 Ensure virus definitions are up to date
 ⬆️ Keep endpoints (PC, laptop AND mobile) fully patched
 🚫 Don't give out unnecessary admin privileges
 💾 Back up your data 
 Actioning the above will give you protection from 98% of attacks, say Microsoft.

 I have two servers running keepalived to share a virtual IP
 and haproxy to forward mail traffic to two mail servers using roundrobin. 
 Where i am currently stuck is
 when my IP fails over using keepalive(which works as expected)
 My HAProxy service doesn't restart, so even though the IP fails over the server doesn't work because haproxy is offline so no mail gets passed through.
 How do i ensure the haproxy service gets restarted once teh server picks up the VIP
 Here is my keepalived config
 ​
 global_defs { router_id haproxy02 # The hostname of this host! } vrrp_script haproxy { script "killall -0 haproxy" interval 2 weight 2 } vrrp_instance 50 { virtual_router_id 50 advert_int 1 priority 100 state Master interface eth0 virtual_ipaddress { 192.168.30.145 dev eth0 # The virtual IP address that will be shared betwee MASTER and BACKUP. } track_script { haproxy } } 
 My Backup haproxy has the same config but state is backup and priority is 50 
 thanks for taking a look

 Offline CA has been offline throughout this as well it shouldn't be needed. CRLs are all valid. PKIView comes back all ok.
 I can see the standard AD templates on the DCs
 I can see the custom templates on other devices if I add them, just not the DCs
 I've tried adding a single DC on to the permisions for the template restarting the CA and still nothing
 The templates have the following persmions
 Authenticated users - Read
 Domain Admin - Read Enroll
 Domain Controlers - Enroll, Auto Enroll
 Tried settings Enterprise Domain Conrollers to Enroll too but made no difference.
 Has there been some changes to AD that means there's now an extra step for DCs to see templates?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 currently my company has a set of Cisco ASA's in a datacenter for Point to site VPN connectivity. Clients get a static IP address and our routers/firewalls etc are configured to (dis)allow those clients to the backends. So basically, every client can get an ACL list attached to it. 
 But now we are going full into Azure. Since the Azure VPN gateways only give out dynamic IP addresses our current setup can't be transferred to native Azure VPN's. 
 I've seen that Cisco has the CSR 1000V in Azure, but I can't find anything regarding static IP addresses (or pools) in the documentation. So, I'm not sure if this would fix our "issue".
 Does anyone have an idea on this issue? I'd rather not deploy a VPN gateway for each set of users. ;) I'm also not tied to Cisco btw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 At the request of the boss, I've been implementing PIM this week in time for an MSP switcheroo next week. 
 I'm writing an email to explain how to request roles in response to 'we tried logging in and don't have access' from the new service desk but I'm having a bit of trouble with the test account I've put together to grab screenshots from - 
 ​
 1- Should I need to sign out/in for the role to become active? The PIM page says the page will refresh by itself, you don't need to sign out/in. 
 I've been trying this for the past couple of hours, and I kept having to sign out/in because waiting 3-5 minutes was yielding no change - the 365 admin page and the ECP page were giving a 'no access sucker' unless I signed out/in.
 Meanwhile, after assigning direct access, then unassigning direct access, then trying again using PIM, it now HAS worked without signing out and in again. Is this the usual experience others have had, or have I just been particularly unlucky with propagation delays
 ​
 2- The Exchange recipient administrator role in particular seems bad for this - I assign it and activate it on my test account, but it doesn't seem to do bugger all. I activate it, I sign out, sign in, do a little dance, and still don't have access to the ECP. 
 Meanwhile, I assign it to be permanently active, sign out, sign in, BAM it's immediately there and works flawlessly. 
 ​
 I've signed out and in to these accounts so many times I'm ready to sign out of existence entirely,I just want someone to confirm whether or not this is the experience other people have had or if I'm just having a particularly bad friday night. 
 ​
 I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and cry into it while I wait to see if it's just been me all along

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone
 I'm the systems admin (and CIO) for a small EU company with a centralized IT system hosting data on a windows file server (in a datacenter accessible via VPN). We also have a Google Workspace plan with an account for each employee.
 Each employee has a windows laptop with a VPN client, once the VPN is on the mapped drives on windows explorer are available. Share permissions are managed in AD.
 Everything on the file server is backed up with a 30-day retention scheme on AWS.
 My CEO wishes to switch all data hosting from the file server to shared Google Drives. He feels the data will be more easily accessible this way, but I really have concerns about this - about security mostly, but also data sync on the PCs and disk space, backups, ... I am reluctant about entrusting sensible data to a 3rd party.
 Is there a consensus about doing something like this in the sysadmin world ? I need to establish a lit of pros / cons to help making the decision : either keep everything as is or follow through.
 If I were to go through with this, are there some good practices to follow ? (obviously enabling MFA will be mandatory)
 Thanks

 With no other IT staff on the continent currently I have to manage offices for a international organization to the best of my ability in my remote office.
 Not helped by often confusing and baffling requests from the head office, so elusive the number of times I have been there could be counted on one hand and I would still have a few fingers to lose.
 ​
 One request that came through a while back still eludes me to the reason why and no answers are forthcoming despite my requests.
 Just before a long weekend I am to lockdown the emails of 5 staff members of head office. No reason given. Just told to do so and if they send in tickets or call me, to let them know we are working on it.
 Its not until after the long weekend and several requests by the locked users for help that I am told to unlock them.
 ​
 No reason is given why, only that the masters of the company half a world away want it.
 None of them were fired as far as i know which makes sense (perhaps someone screwed up or was being terminated and we needed to limit access, that is nothing new to me).
 But nothing as far as I know changed and as all the other IT staff are out of contact right now, I would be the one to remove their access.
 ​
 It just leaves me with a uncertainty in my stomach.
 ​
 I am curious if any others have this happen to you. Told to change permissions like this with seemingly no rhyme or reason ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 We had to pull drives from a dell R620 server. There were 6 drives in total that had to be removed from the server. It is believed that 2 are in a RAID 1 for the OS and the remaining 4 in a RAID 5 but it is not confirmed. I won't get into why we couldn't confirm that, it's a long story, but just go with it. 
 The drives were pulled BUT I realize that we did not note down the exact slot each drive came from. We will need to pop them back in further down the road. My initial thought process was the RIAD controller should be smart enough to figure it out, but I am realizing that might not be the case and I may have made a grave mistake.
 Just wondering if there's any insight on whether or not the physical slot matters when it comes time to plug them back in. 
 Thank you very much

 The reg key fix does not fix the problem for any of my team. 
 I only observe reset packets to a domain controller during the rdp request. Removing the October and September CU’s from that DC, resolve the issue seemingly. 
 My problem is that it appears totally random, I will have clients all at the same patch level, remote to the same server using the same dc. It will fail for one client and have no issue with the other. I will reboot the clients and it will start working again. 
 To add more salt to the wounds the OOB fix MS released does piss all for any win10/11 clients & I’m not sure if they even acknowledged the issue right now

 I have 20+ years experience with Cisco and would rather not stray but I am being forced to look at alternatives due to supply chain constraints and our timeline. 
 I am told they are not as affected by supply chain but am cautious that there may be a reason for that as if they aren’t as good.
 Curious about others thoughts.

 Server: Dell PowerEdge R7525
 OS: ESXi 7.0.3
 Card: Intel E810-XXVDA4
 Switch: QNAP QSW-M5216-1T-US
 ​
 Hello,
 I recently got a new Switch (above model) and the Intel 25Gb card (not directly from Dell) and added it to our R7525 in one of the empty bays.
 The 25Gb connection worked for a few hours, but has yet to work again. It works at 10Gb fine to the above Switch using a non-25Gb (SFP+) cable, but as soon as an SFP28 cable is used to that Switch, it doesn't show a connection on either end (NIC or Switch). However, using a regular SFP+ cable, both work fine. And the SFP28 cable works in a different NIC entirely connecting at 10Gb, so the cables are fine. And the NIC itself is fine, since it works at 10Gb perfectly fine (and once at 25Gb fine (I even took a screenshot to show a coworker we were finally at 25Gb internally)).
 However, I'm at a loss at what could cause it no longer working, especially when neither the NIC or the Switch is showing any sort of connection using SF28 a cable. And ESXi shows the connection as "Down," of course.
 And the server is fairly brand new, so I know it has plenty of PCIe lanes to absorb and plenty of empty PCIe slots to use up since dual-CPU server. I think I tried slot 5 and 7 in the server. It initially worked that one time on slot 5 (I think it was in riser 2?), but stopped after a few hours.
 Multiple cables, multiple manufacturers (10GTek coded for Cisco (initial); Macroreer coded for Intel (last resort)).
 Dell will obviously not assistance since the card is aftermarket, but I have 2 and both are doing the same thing in this same server.
 Link for proof it DID work <once>: https://imgur.com/a/33jBzsH
 Any sort of assistance/direction would be greatly appreciated, as I'm clueless at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, first of all I'm not a high-level networking engineer, far from it actually, but I know my way around most of the stuff we need to do, and as a lone sysadmin I kind of have to.
 We recently migrated to Nutanix and along with the nodes we got ourselves a pair of new Alcatel OmniSwitch OS6900 TOR switches. Tricky ones to manage, but solid. 
 Our old server rack will be decommissioned but our old TOR switches are not that old at all, they're a pair of HP FlexFabric 5700s. Our core switch, on the other hand, is a VERY old HP 5406zl, with rapidly dying PoE ports and a general feeling that the whole thing is going to die soon as well. Switches are still hard to find, so getting new ones would take at least 6 to 10 months. 
 So, in the meantime, I'm thinking about replacing the 5400 with the 5700.
 Now, when I say "core" switch I do not actually mean it, it's by all intents and purposes an access switch: no l3, no gateway, no nothing. All routing is done through the firewall. All it has connected to it are clients, and a trunk to the TOR switches.
 We would not hit any of the limitations of the 5700 (i.e. the 1024 entry arp-table) but we would gain a healthy new switch.
 Yet, since I constantly doubt myself, I'm asking Reddit: am I missing something here?

 Today our company hosted a Town Hall in Teams, and we had some serious issues that our CEO was pissed about.
 Background: Users were mostly on wired internal network, and using the Desktop Teams app.
 Had over 100 people in the call and we were recording it.
 1). Anyone with a webcam on was extremely laggy and glitchy, but audio was fine.
 2). Screen Sharing a video would not show for users in the call, they could only see a grey square.
 Had no issues when I joined on my phone and even the recording was fine. It's when we were live that we had issues.
 Any solutions to this, I saw disabling GPU hardware acceleration helped, but I can't find a way to disable it for all users.

Some TCP implementation use selective acknowledgements (SACKs) to provide explicit feedback about the segments that have been received. This greatly improves TCP's ability to retransmit the right segments.
  
but it doesn't say how common that both sides support this is. Is it like 50% of all tcp connections? 90%? 10%?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago we implemented a solution working with a Cisco guy who has now gone on to other jobs. I have maintained the solution with a very basic level of Cisco knowledge he passed on. We are looking at replacing the devices before we face an outage and are scrambling. We are trying to find a more user-friendly solution that still does the job and thus I seek advice.
 Currently, we have two Cisco 1811 in a data center. Our needs are fairly simple and I have been told in the past we can replace both with a single device these days. We have an Incoming device that has VPNs to the providers and contains all the traffic from field devices. That is connected to the second outgoing CISCO directly and then routes traffic via VPN to various clients based on which devices are theirs.
 Traffic to the internet is restricted with a few exceptions, some IP based, some port-based.
 What replacement device would best meet my needs? Preferably something with a GUI interface instead of the CISCO command lines. 
 *edit to add some details*
 My concerns are really just about the two routers into one or needing two.
 At present, I have some IP routes for each client VPN, like below.
 ip route 10.232.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.32.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 I also have to NAT everything from one provider's VPN to the client VPN.
 ip nat inside source static 10.232.128.200 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
 I don't really care about the brand, just function and something a bit more user-friendly for a fairly entry-level of networking knowledge.

 I upgraded the AP to "latest recommended version" which was version 10.x versus the 8.9.0.3 the AP was on previously.
 All the options for configuring the VC in central went away. I asked my rep about it, and got this statement back:
 I'm afraid "Virtual Mobility Gateways" are not supported yet. Right now, the only thing we have is "Virtual VPNCs", which you can run in Azure, AWS, Google and ESXi. 
 So before you blindly upgrade central connected IAPs in a VC setup, take heed.

 ​
 How can it be so bad after so many years this protocol has been out?! Not only can the authentication options be changed only in the who knows how many years old control panel settings and not the modern settings app, but once you finish setting up the network, you can no longer modify some of the key attributes like which CA certificates to validate the radius server against!
 ​
 What. The. Hell. Microsoft.
 ​
 I swear, I don't usually get my jimmies rustled at work, but this... This just bloody infuriated me!
 ​
 And that's not the end of it, either!
 Once you finally figure out how to configure the authentication details... Unless you remembered to change one tiny little option in the PEAP configuration, if someone was to impersonate an AP, even if they present a completely different and invalid server certificate, windows just displays a puny little dialog going something like "Do you expect this network to be present here?" along with a hyperlink option to display the radius certificate, and a pair of buttons - Connect / Cancel.
 ​
 No huge warning like in web browsers, if a page presents an invalid SSL cert, noooo. No 3-dialogs-deep exception confirmation option or secret keyboard phrases. 
 ​
 A simple. Yes. No. 
 ​
 Am I missing something here, or would that take away all the benefits the Enterprise version of WPA2 has?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I had a Cisco AP (3802i) swapped out for an Extreme Networks one (AP250) trying to test something. Got the Extreme AP connected and it connected back to XIQ fine. AP reported that there were several clients connected to it and I figured everything was fine. Turns out things were not fine as the clients (primarily iPads) now consistently disconnect from wireless. Some flat out drop off Wifi and say "Cannot connect to X network" or that they can't connect to the Internet and other times they appear to be working but with low signal strength. I think they're going from the Extreme AP to a Cisco one that's in another room across the hall from where the Extreme AP which is really odd since that Cisco AP appears to have really weak signal going into that room. 
 ​
 The same SSIDs are configured on both Cisco and Extreme with the same VLANs being attributed to both. We use the same model of Extreme Network APs in another building and they work fine. My guess is that the clients keep trying to connect to the Cisco AP instead of the Extreme but I'm not understanding why when the Extreme AP should have better signal strength vs the Cisco one. I know mixing APs from different manufacturers isn't really ideal but this was the only room where we made this kind of swap.

 See below for error from error log:
 The system is entering sleep.
 Sleep reason application API
 Source: kernel-power
 Event ID 42
 Any advice would be appreciated. Even downloaded software “don’t sleep” and disabled sleep but it still does it.
 Edit
 It used to happen a lot more frequently, we thought it could be the cheap adapters we had. Replacing them helped a lot, but still sleeps occasionally but always seems to be very shortly after booting.

Does Microsoft have some basic PAM options built into their OS/Directory services? is there a separate Microsoft solution you can use (or purchase) that creates a basic PAM solution? if not, what third-party options exist? we use the following vendors for additional infrastructure services so something from them would be nice: Azure, Microsoft 365, Quest, SolarWinds, CrowdStrike, Mimecast, Duo, Palo Alto. I'm also curious what is the minimum configuration that meets the requirement of a PAM solution (can we make a low-level version of one out-of-the-box without having to purchase/install additional solutions)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you manage Backup Targets & Selections in your IT shops? For example, let's say you have 100 Windows Servers and 10 Windows 10 clients and you have been tasked with installing a brand new backup solution that backs up files and folders via backup agents. You are creating the new backup job, and you have to decide which servers/clients get agents installed, and which server/client disks/folders you want to select as part of your backup jobs. Does IT just make an educated guess at what needs to be backed up? Does the business unit provide IT with a list of data sources (structured and unstructured) and IT works off of that? 
 In our shop, IT decides what should be selected for backup on a daily basis knowing where actual company data lives. If it can't be recreated elsewhere, we back it up. If there is another source of that same data (and its current, then we skip it). For example, we do backup our home and shared folders, but we don't back up application installation folders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, 
 I have just started a new gig working in a 99% Terminal Services Environment with the vast majority of users working off Windows 7/10 HP Thin Clients connecting via RDS to Windows Server 2016. 
 Users are logging into Thin Clients with Generic Auto Logins and then authenticate via RDC to their sessions. This is problematic for new users because you can't change your password from RDC, at least not without making the process overly complicated by disabling NLA Server Side and a convoluted process client side with first tie logins using a secondary RDC shortcut with CredSSP disabled.
 I haven't worked in a shop that has had this problem, formally I was the IT manager for a mid size org and our TS were connected to from Windows workstations so users were already authenticated.
 The IT Manager's process has been to assign users passwords in the past and set them to not expire. Then he would communicate the password to the user or manager for login. Obviously this is 1. Not Secure, 2. Cumbersome as hell. 3. Several points of failure. 
 This has been made more ridiculous by the fact that about 6 months ago they brought an MSP onboard who is now handling "some" of the user onboarding process including creation of AD accounts and they use a temp password as they should. But, now new users can't login. And my understanding is that new users have just been hijacking others accounts to get to sessions, creating security issues, profiles issues etc. 
 My understanding is that the RDP Web Portal will resolve this issue, but I am honestly not familiar with using it and wanted to see if anyone had any input before I go suggesting this as the solution to the org. 
 My understanding is that Users would connect to the RDP Web Portal via a browser where they would authenticate for the first time and be able to reset their passwords, and from there they would have access to their Terminal Services Sessions, is this accurate?

Sadly out of my team of 5, only one is up for discussion for a promotion. The four other guys are just workers and I try to coach them so they can hit that next level but I don’t think they care or just think they are going to be promoted based on their employment length. These four guys work the best bankers hours in the business but if I need something pressing over outside of their time which happens maybe 5 times a year, 3 will never pick up the phone and will respond to my text hours later and the other one simply doesn’t acknowledge it all. The one guy who is getting promoted is super reliable and will not only answer my call but is happy to jump in if needed. Do people really think the are going to get a raise and promotion just because they show up and do their job? What ever happened to going above and beyond? These guys are going to be in for a shock especially with inflation and realize with their small bump, it’s actually going to be a pay cut in the long run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the most part, Win 11 is pretty much the same, but there's a few things I wanted to find out before continuing, particularly because the vast majority of our staff do not work from the office anymore.
  
While we're still on Windows 10, I wanted to explore any/all new Group Policies for Windows 11. How do I correctly add the Win11's C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions files to our SYSVOL without breaking Win10? Or are new PolicyDefinitions backwards compatible (ie all old settings are in new templates, so will still apply)? I've updated the policy templates in the past but only within the same OS - is it just the same procedure?
 
I think I read somewhere that Win11 is no longer supported by MDT as they're pushing for InTune. I haven't messed around with this yet, but is this true? We don't use 365 (Google Workspace unfortunately) so having to subscribe/set up InTune would be an extra cost/delay to this whole thing.
 
If you've upgraded your domain to Win 11, how did you do this? Did you use WSUS to deploy the upgrade or did you recall the hardware to do it in person? I know the cleanest way is formatting but let's assume that that's just not an option for us.
 
Did your staff adjust/like the change to the center start menu/icons or do you/did you just take it back to the bottom left?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm a Senior IT Tech at a rural ISP who's just come in to replace a 3rd party support.
 One of the (many) issues I have is we have a handful of Linux users of which I've never managed from a sys admin view before (used Linux in personal life etc.).
 The issues i have are; 
 ​
  
They all want to use different distros
 don't want to be managed via saas solutions
 want local admin on their devices
 they were given windows devices but 3rd party support to which they wiped and installed their flavour of Linux.
 CTO wants them to run Windows with linux in a Virtual box VM ( i dont think this is workable)
  
​
 My current thinking is, for them to all run the same flavour of Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04 LTS) as these are both supported by Intune (in its infancy atm but hoping to get more control over the coming months) with AdminByRequest which i'm currently trailing with some windows users.
 I know no matter what i do i'm going to have an uphill battle as currently they have free roam of their devices as they're basically personal devices at this stage! But from a sys admin and security viewpoint this is a huge no go! I want them to have the best experience to do their job as they can but there has to be a line where they are formatting devices! I know if i dont approach this right they will just format it again. Currently in the progress of writing a laptop policy for staff to sign also to stop them doing certain things without a slap on the wrists!
 Open to any other ideas or advice!

 ​
 I am stragling with setup WHfB on some computers in company. The hybrid key trust configuration is completed and basically it works flawless on all laptops. Though, on some desktops users cannot setup PIN due to error saying that this device do not meet WHfB requirements.
 Fun part is that if any other use sign-in to that desktops with his account, then the issue not exist anymore and they can set their PINs. So, despite of what the error says, I think it is some issue with specific users profile. I believe they tried setup Windows hello before the configuration was ready so something might be mixing here now. I tried to delete NGC folder, but that did not help.
 Is there any way to completely purge WHfB settings of user, other than complete deletion of his profile?

 I'm currently troubleshooting an issue with our 2 on premise Domain Controllers,
 +6000 event 521 are generated every hour (Status code 0x80000005)
 From what I can gather, the issue could be that "LSA Queue" is full, because Audit events are generated faster than what can be processed. ( windows - Event ID 521 - Critical Logging Failure on Domain Controllers - Server Fault )
 Now, enabling the LSA event log, shows a lot of Event ID300's containing "Groups assigned to a new logon." and then the device/user and the groups assigned. Which to me seems of no value logging wise.
 ​
 Has anyone here dealt with that type of problem?
 Right now I'm looking into either increasing the LSA Queue, og maybe limit/remove that particular audit event.

 I thought that all serial cables are the same eventual I found out that there are ; - Crossover or "Null Modem" - Straight Through Serial Cable
 My question is all crossover cables are Null modem?
 From the oracle documents the connection is required to have this pin out.
 Pin 3 --> Receive Data Pin 4 --> Transit Data Pin 6 --> GND 
 I have found on superuser web page that I could use RS232 Null Modem Cable DB9F to DB9M which I bought from Amazon.
 Is this cable allright? Did anyone used this type of connection before?
 Are there any SSH terminals that could change the serial PIN out?
 Any help would be appreciated.
 BTW my laptop doesn't have a serial connection, so USB 2.0 is my only option.

When I switch on the VPN, on chrome I can't connect to 192.168.1.1 and to the home server (192.168.1.80), although I can connect to the home server from safari, but not to the first router (192.168.1.1) BUT on both safari and chrome I can connect to the other router (192.168.1.254).
 I honestly can't get my head around why on two browsers on the same machine the behaviour is not the same. 
 How can I solve these problems?

 ​
 Just wondering if anyone's supporting Huawei devices that have suddenly started prompting users for having the wrong username/password in the past couple days.
 Have had a few staff in China with BYOD phones (P40's) not able to get their work emails anymore using the default built in mail app. I don't have such a device myself to test with unfortunately - only an old pre-trade war Nova 3i.
 Re-entering passwords hasn't helped, re-creating the account hasn't worked.
 Edit - Azure sign in logs show no failures, Disabling MFA doesn't help, google has no suggestions, Huawei website lacks info and the Huawei subreddit has no posts complaining about this either, so wondering if it's a Microsoft change or what?
 Outlook app proper seems to work, but it seems the default one has better contacts integration, like how Apple's mail app is the only one that works for their contacts.
 ​
 Anyone else? Ta :)

 we're trying to rollout some yubikeys to our colleagues and my boss wants to "force" usage as smart cards for windows 10 (ie: GPO Interactive Logon: force smart card or windows hello). This leaves us with a bunch of problems:
  
we have to use admin yubikeys to elevate local demands
 remote support has to have a passthrough functionality (currently talking with teamviewer here)
  
So my question is, do you guys know any middleware that allows a bit finer tuning of windows logon instead of goin all in with that GPO? I heard about SCInterface or DUO. Any experience with this kind of software? Is it even possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fellow SysAdmin was making 80K salaried, but working 60 hour weeks, easily. Typically 5-7am to 5-7pm. Not to mention after hours when on call. That is actually less per hour than average Tier 1 Help Desk technicians make here (~$22/hr), if they work 60 hour weeks with overtime past the 40 hour mark (1.5x). Not to mention, $22 is starting rate.
 40*22*52+20*33*52 = 80,080 > 80,000
 Basically if a Help Desk worker put in 60 hour weeks, they would be above SysAdmin for annual income, even if both were doing the same (60 hours). And Help Desk would be not needing to be on call at all. The only thing stopping this, is Help Desk managers restricting total weekly hours techs can work (in theory). I know this is part of why companies have salaried workers in the first place, but it's still wild to think many SysAdmins are making such a low effective rate per hour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little more context:
 I work in a team of 5 (manager and 3 other network admins). There's kinda no direction or vision, feel like there's barely any management from our manager (apart from a "you doing OK?" every few days). We've just got a few projects we're each working on, but other than that there's really no visibility into what's going on.
 Everyone works from home, so it's hard to feel like I'm even working in a team to be honest.
 Does anyone else experience this? Is it normal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep reading articles trying to understand MTU and people are saying if your ip MTU is set to 1500 that means the largest packet that can be sent is 1500. Now if you are getting fragmentation then you should lower the mtu. But the thing is fragmentation occurs when you need to split the packet into multiple in order to not go above 1500. So why would you lower the mtu to 1400 in that case it doesn't make sense.

 I want to put a simple web server machine listening on some random port (65000 for example) and be able to do the following:
  
traffic initiated from internet to 33.33.33.33:65000
 vm-instance (ubuntu os) should take this internet traffic, change the dest ip to 192.168.1.2:65000
 send traffic to router and router will forward it to the web server
  
My questions are: is this possible? and what nat/ip table commands would I apply on the vm-instance?
 ​
 ---
 note: The server can access the internet because I enabled ip forwarding and applied a NAT rule on the vm-instance (server > router > mgmt cloud > internet)

Anybody know how to effectively fight these creeps if one values their credit rating? They go full-on scam, reminder "fees", late fees, and threaten collections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xcqz2r/solo_it_asked_to_do_engineering_work
 So a while back I, solo IT at my company, was asked to restructure the manufacturing processes in our companies manufacturing planning system (see original post for full story). As many pointed out, this fell entirely in the realm of industrial engineering.
 A few days ago I made the company an offer. I would help restructure their processes with the help of 3rd party consultants, but I will not work IT at the same time. So they'd have to choose what full time position they want me to be in.
 After consideration they decided today that they wanted me to work full time on reimplementing their manufacturing processes and it would be very clear to the rest of the company that I am no longer IT and should not be approached regarding regarding any IT issue moving forward. This will take effect in 1-2 weeks.
 I then asked, so how will IT be handled when I'm moved off? How will we hire someone in time to learn and manage all the IT processes? They said that end-users will have to step up their game and figure out how to troubleshoot their own issues.
 I'm very excited. Not only do I get to tell end users "not my problem anymore" when the inevitable storm hits from IT being torn away, Im also betting they last no more than 2 weeks tops before they pull me off engineering and beg me to get back to handling IT. We'll see how that conversation goes 😉

 ​
 Fast forward to now, I woke up the other day with fever and real bad sore throat. I sent an email to my boss saying I wasn't going to be in and he was totally fine with it. I still felt guilty, and tried coming in today since I felt a lot better, but everyone at work was just like "nah go home, we don't want to catch whatever you had", even when I went to tell my boss I was going home, he was totally cool with me taking today off as well.

 These days servers doesn't have RS232 connection. To connect to network device console interface (for example Cisco NCS-5501-SE) I'm trying to use some kind of '4world' USB to RS232 serial converter. And seems it works very buggy... the typing is slow and the letters are 'thrown out'. Almost impossible even to login. So i'm wondering if there're any additional command to make USB-to-RS232 serial converter work better ? Because without converter it works OK"
 To connect without adapter i'm using this command - and everything is OK:
 screen /dev/ttyS0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 When changing connection to USB adapter mode - same settings, i just change the device naming to USB0:
 screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 and the shit starts to hit the fan.
 I'm wondering if it's the adapter fault, some additional settings should apply ? Or the USB-to-Serial adapter suppose to work badly ? 
 Thanks

At implementation time neither vendor would take responsibility for the integration. What they meant from the start is that it's possible to use ETL to connect the two. I had to build it. Now it's my baby and any time there's a problem with it, I have to fix it. I've got a baker's dozen babies at this point. Got an email from a manager the other day asking me to show him how to troubleshoot the solution that his department needs so that he doesn't have to wait for me to be free to fix it. I was seconds away from suggesting that he could prevent the problems proactively by hiring competent people who wouldn't fuck it up in the first place. I don't know where I'm going with this. It's just a pointless rant. The real solution is that I need to train my tiny little team on all these solutions so that we can support them as a team. I'm just afraid that once I let them loose on my environment, they'll just become another userbase that I constantly have to support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a distributed ISE deployment with 2 PANS and 3 PSNs, one of the PSN' SSL cert has expired. Our Internal CA has generated a new cert but we're not able to add it back in as the Intermediate CA that signed the cert has renewed its cert 6 months ago. Thus the newly generated cert is not accepted as the trusted CA on the PAN has a different serial number (old one) to the one that signed new CSR. 
 As it stands, we will have to replace the Trusted Cert (the intermediate Win Server) with the new one. Then apply the new Cert to all the other PSNs, This means we'd have a total outage across our estate. 
  
Is there another way to replace the expired cert without doing all of them, Our Windows team have advised they will not be able to sign/generate a cert with the old intermediate CA. 
 Also while we do this, how do we ensure the pre-authorised machines will not have any issues? (we have authentication open on the port as well a "authentication event no-response action authorize vlan" but this will drop the traffic into a guest vlan.

 At my workplace we have a SCCM server which does have WSUS enabled on it, and we just got a couple of new Win 11 machines and there were a couple of issues we are experiencing with them being able to update from the Windows Updates section in Settings.
 After a machine joins the domain it will install the SCCM client and once the client is installed it removes the "Check online for updates from Microsoft Update" in Windows Updates. I know there are some registry entries you can change or delete to get it working but I was wondering has anyone been able to get that back wither it was from Group Policy or another method? Or if anyone else has dealt with the same issue they has a resolution to it? Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had to stop myself 3 times this week from dumping my gear in my bosses office with a note that says I quit. But I'm a chicken and I feel too guilty to quit.
 I have been working non stop since July while the executives pat each other on the backs and congratulate each other on all the growth they've had. Including myself I have a team of 3. They have went from 300 people last year to 800 this year. Two helpdesk and me the "IT manager". Or should I say field tech/sysadmin/network engineer/helpdesk Tier 2/security.
 They have opened up 3 new branches and bought one company. They gave one week lead times for each to be set up. They have me traveling and staying overnight all over the state for these. They now want a network overhaul by thanksgiving for cyber insurance purposes and a new time keep software customized, tested, trained, and deployed before December. I'm working through nights days and weekends.
 Maybe I'm just not cut out for IT management. I've started having heart palpitations. I'm terrified every time my phone dings. I daydream every time I drive to work on crashing just to get a short break in the hospital. My temper and anxiety are 0 to 100 at the smallest problem. Maybe I should be a potato farmer.
 I was getting paid $50,000 a year at the beginning of the year. I've been in this position for 4 years. I demanded more money and they bumped me to $70,000 and promise to double my bonus making it 10 grand at the end of November.
 I'm trying to just get everything they want done and hang on to get my bonus. Then push my guilt down enough to dip. I miss my family.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I enabled 2FA for all users via a conditional access policy. Majority had 2FA enforced anyway, including our admin account used for AD Connect.
 We're now receiving errors with our Azure AD Connect sync - specifically:
 "Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must enroll in multi-factor authentication to access".
 When I check the sign-in logs for that account I can see that it's suggested that the MFA claim isn't being satisfied which is required because of the CA policy enforced.
 However, that's not the case because we have 2FA enforced and when going through the Azure AD Connect sync process, I'm entering the 2FA code we have in our 2FA app, which is accepted.
 We're also able to log into the admin portal with the same account while satisfying the 2FA requirements.
 I've disabled 2FA on the account and re-enabled it, but this has made no difference. We also don't have security defaults enabled.
 The user is also not part of risky users or risky sign-ins.
 Has anyone come across this before?

We have had issues after installing the October updates on our DC's. The issue seemed to prevent cross-site kerberos authentication over RDP for us. We'd see an event ID 4769 with the error code of 0x14(TGT was revoked). It failed until we uninstalled almost every update from October. Below is the event, the account name section was always empty.
 Is there something I have missed with these updates that would cause this? I feel if the issue was present for everyone it'd be a lot bigger deal and I'd see more information. However, I have seen no mention of issues for anyone else.
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[r/Emailmarketing does not let me post so I want to ask this question here
 In our company we have two use cases for sending mails to a larger audience
  
Multiple times a year, we want to inform part of our customers (or all) of increasing prices for our products. Recipient count around 1000-1500.
 Marketing wants to inform customers of upcoming trade fairs
  
I have just now learned about different email marketing software and that there is a difference between a marketing mail and a transactional mail. I am under the assumption that for use case 1) we should not use our own mail server since the high amount of mails might put us on a blacklist - is this correct?
 If yes and we need an external tool for this, would use case 1) count as a transactional mail? All recipients come from our CRM system and had direct contact to Sales at some point in the past.
 For use case 2) I'm pretty sure this counts as a marketing mail and requires recipients to opt-in first. This is fine for use case 2) but would not make much sense for use case 1) as getting all of our customers to sign up for price increase mails is unrealistic.
 I would appreciate some further input to guide me in the right direction. Thanks!

 We bought a "small" 75 person company, they have on prem AD, and hybrid exchange and so do we.
 We'd like to merge all their users/computers/domains into our AD. Same thing for their mailboxes (they don't use much else o365 related)
 So far we've set up the vpn between the 2 locations and we're going to raise domain/forest level to match the highest one and set up the trust between the two domains.
 Which steps are needed to do this as smoothly as possible ?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been noticing recently that some new HP computers run a bios firmware upgrade during their deployment (using MDT). During the deployment, I install a recent cumulative update which I downloaded from the microsoft catalog. This is a rudimentary way to have a windows deployment up to date when delivering it. After deployment, the sccm update system kicks in.
 The process of Bios firmware updates coming with Windows updates is detailed here:
 https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07009542
 Strangely, I've never seen these bios firmware updates happen with updates pushed to clients over SCCM, even though the cumulative updates should be the same.
 Is anyone aware of a difference between cumulative updates pushed with SCCM and cumulative updates downloaded from the catalog, or of another process which might block bios firmware upgrades during the regular monthly update cycle?
 I don't necessarily dislike the update process over wsus if it takes care of bios passwords and bitlocker lockouts (which it seems to do) but I'd rather schedule it and inform the users if it would come in the regular monthly update cycle.
 The settings titled “Prompt for Admin authentication on Capsule Update” controls the password requirement for use with BIOS updates via UEFI Capsule. The default value is “Disable,” which does not require a password for this flash mechanism.

 I work for a training center that teaches MS Office applications, Windows, and some more technical classes such as SQL and Windows Server. Since all of our classes went virtual a couple years ago, I created a way of running the classes- I set up a Guacamole server to get the students into their lab PCs. We use GoToTraining for the classroom meeting. And finally we use Logical Operations for the courseware book & materials. 
 This has worked ok, but it's a bit clunky giving the students 3 different things to log into. Especially for our more novice ones, it can be a hassle. Does anyone know of an off-the-shelf learning system that we could use to combine these things?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're going to shortly refresh our fleet of remote laptops by resetting Windows, configuring them with Autopilot and enrolling them with Intune for management. We currently deploy devices with MDT and are able to specify that the drive is Bitlocker encrypted with the requirement to unlock being that the TPM is present and the user uses a PIN. It doesn't appear that this is possible with Autopilot - there's no built in mechanism during the Autopilot process to prompt a user to enter a pin that would then need to be used to unlock the drive when they power it on. Has anyone found a way to achieve this?
 This has raised the question whether the additional protection of a PIN (alongside the TPM) is necessary to secure our remote devices. If we BitLocker our drives using the TPM only as the requirement to unlock it then the data on it is protected if the drive is removed and plugged in to another machine. Additionally, if the device is lost/stolen then the user will need Windows credentials to log in to the laptop and access the data on it. If we couldn't find a way to dynamically add a pin to our remote devices, are there any things I'm missing by using this as a secure solution? 
 We want our data to be secure on our remote devices and up until now BitLocker with a TPM and a Pin has been how we achieve that. I guess my question is whether our data on remote devices is still considered to be secure (in the eyes of the industry and best practice) if we encrypt our drives using TPM only as the mechanism to unlock it.

 Right now I am in a pickle and I need to figure out the best way to get tons of testing results from production lines, index them, and share them with our biggest customer. Problem is that I kinda have 2 days to do it. 
 O was thinking about a solution: Shared Drives > Power Gateway > Flow > Power Automate > Sharepoint > Index > Azure Guest account and be done with it. 
 Problem is that I do not have a Power license and I can't get one that quickly. So now I need to replace Gateway with syncing on-prem to OneDrive and then run copy flow and everything cloud only. 
 What do you think? Install OneDrive on FS and manually put local folders to sync or create a VM, map the drives and run sync outside the FS? Or maybe a third solution? I am afraid that changing folders to Sync mode can f*up the NTFS rights, paths, dedup, or anything else. 
 Thank you in advance!

 If a device it connected to a switch, then I want to see the following things: MAC-Address, IP-Address, VLAN-Tag and the Device name.
 My idea is that with the Software installed on a Raspberry PI I put one in every patch room. So that it automatically reads the port and I just need to enter the room.
 Maybe a web gui to see it from my office.
  
 Is there a Software you use? Or ideas you have to this?
 For my exam programming is not so necessary because its not the main part of my training for the Job. 
 So I hope there is a software I can use.
 Kind regards
 Lennart

 Old admins used the default domain policy...this policy had a lax policy.....
 To ease users into things we created a temp policy and applied it to the MyOrgUsers OU. THe gpo was enforced and place on the top of the link order. However the default domain policy keeps winning despite it not being enforced.
 TLDR....Default Domain Policy that is not ENFORCED is winning and not letting our custom password policy apply settings. Also I changed the default domain policy password to not defined and that did not work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK, first of all, I am still considering this and not sure if I should do it. I am looking for advise if this is feasible at all
 I am a IT professional, but mostly datacenter oriented. I did build some wireless networks; based on UBNT hardware (usually up to 100 people).
 In my free time, I help out NGO's and like wise organization with my expertise. One of those NGOs is organizing a small conference (200-300 people) and have a desire to have a seperated WiFi network and not use the hotel network (1. because hotel networks are not always stable, 2. security is not always up to par/sometimes shared with other guests)
 I am now designing a potential network to see if this project is feasible, as tell them if I can do it or not.
 I am considering UBNT, as I know the software/hardware and it is easy to configure for me. Its a temporary network, so speedy deployment is important, using UBNT will help with that.
 Below is my initial plan and looking for feedback if this will produce a stable enough network: 
 There are two floors in play here (F1 & F3, F2 is not used/not part of this) 
 Floor 1
 - Room 1: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 2: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 3: 128m2/40 people, 1 AP
 - Attrium, 1600m2, 300 people, 6 AP 
 Floor 3
 - 4 rooms of each ~100m2/50 people, 1 AP each 
 Total: 13 APs, probably order a few extra to fill in potential gaps. Probably will we rent the equipment. 
 People have one or two devices, so I probably need a /22. Disable client-to-client communication, to limit broadcasts/ARP-traffic on the network. Alternative would be to split it in smaller subnets, but people will roam around, so I think that is not convenient. 
 Build up time, 1-2 days. It will be running a lot of wires.... 
 Looking forward to read that I am crazy to consider this. ;-)

 Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, "The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term." Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. 
  
 Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. 
 Thank for any insight

 I hope you are feeling great and have a nice and quiet day.
 Let´s get to the topic: Many of my users (including myself) have noticed a horrible decrease of performance for the whole system, as soon as one starts to share his/her screen on a Teams meeting.
 Everything takes way longer to open up and the whole system starts to feel some kind of unstable. Everything you click on has a high latency.
 We have allready checked the performance monitor on the computers. The only thing that was noticable was that Teams consumpts arround 15 - 30 percent of CPU usage (for a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 as an example). Neither the SSD, GPU, RAM or other components seem to have a higher workload. It´s just the CPU, but anyway it´s by far not at 100% workload.
 I googled arround and found out that this problem seems to be well known for many people but nobody seems to have a solution for it.
 ​
 Does anyone else encounter the same behaviour of Teams or maybe even have a few hints for us or a solution for the problem?
 ​
 Thank you in advance!
 ​
 ​
 Edit// I forgot to mention that all of our computers at least have a 10th or 11th gen i7 with 16GB RAM and a m.2 ssd.

 Trying to get a rough time estimate for how long it takes to manage 7 esxi/VMware hosts with 35 total VMs (combination of windows and Linux) on them.
 We don't need to actually manage the operating system of the VMs, just storage/ram/CPU and networking.
 The things I wondering about are how many hours a week it takes to manage: 1. Updating esxi hosts (new esxi firmware and os) 2. Updating esxi configuration 3. Updating OSVM configurations 4. Securing and preparing for security evaluation for esxi/VMware.
 Just ball park numbers or how many people you have working on that level of infrastructure.
 Edit: for people asking ... I am an admin. Management is telling me I need take over a new vsphere cluster. I am telling them that it's a lot of work on top of the admin work I am already doing.

A brand new ask is for contractors with non AD machines to be able to authenticate. Trying to figure out if the following is possible or a pipe dream.
 Contractors hit the guest network (default gateway is our Palo Alto firewall which handles all security and routing for guest). Redirect to ISE, log in with AD creds. Traffic then hits the Palo (since it's the gateway) and the Palo then assigns access based on the AD account used in the ISE portal.
 So... 1. Capwap to controller cwa to ise 2. Login ad to use portal 3. Ise passes user info to Palo which then tags secpols by user name

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am running into a brick wall here with our DMVPN configuration that was originally setup by people long gone from the company. From what I'm seeing we have a traditional hub n spoke configuration with BGP as the dynamic routing protocol. On all of our spoke routers I can see two NHRP NHS's Output below (The old ISP public WAN IP that needs to be replaced with our new ISP public IP & and the 2nd that should stay). I am having an issue with where to go to re-configure this first NHRP NHS NBMA address.
 10.XXX.XXX.3 E NBMA Address: XX.XX.XX.XX priority = 0 cluster = 0
 10.XXX.XXX.4 RE NBMA Address: XX.XX.XX.XX priority = 0 cluster = 0
 I can see the locally connected route from the hub to the 10.XXX.XXX.4 in this case, but not the .3
 ​
 How do all spokes know about an NBMA address not being advertised by the hub? Does a brand new tunnel need to be created on the hub with the new public IP?
 Note - There is a switch connecting the 2 WAN IPs to the hub router.
 For whatever reason a 'Show IP NHRP NHS' command on the hub shows me nothing.
 I also named this post dual isp redundancy and not dual hub. I'm hoping I don't have to create a new hub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day. I posted this same question in r/sysadmin a few days ago and got some good info, but I am seeking more opinions from this group now as was suggested. 
 We are looking at replacing our current Wifi environment (Ruckus) spread over about 6-10 buildings/sites with something newer. I am curious about the pros and cons of various modern systems (ruckus, meraki, cisco, ubiquity, aruba, juniper, extreme etc) and what fellow network admins have experienced in recent years. What do you like and dislike about a particular product, what should we look out for, etc? 
 I would like this new build to let us take a wifi first approach, so I'd like something rock solid, good performance and security, and hopefully somewhat affordable. We currently have 1gbps PoE switches, but once their lifecycle is up we could certainly get 2.5 or 5gbps ports to support future growth. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: we use OSPF as IGP protocol for the underlay and then BGP sourced by loopbacks in each of the VTEPs/pods.
 For the BGP process I thought I could only activate the l2vpn family because I need to distribute just MAC addresses, no IPV4 routes. On Huawei S5700 switches it seems that if the ipv4 family is not active everything stops working though. I thought I may generalize and just say "activate the family you need and nothing else"; if you need not IPv4 then shut it down.
 Is really like I descrived above or is there an explanation for that? Or might it a bug of the OS on the S5700?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With people getting more laptops, there's a need for more flexible connection types in our building. While NAC is somewhere in the pipeline, I wanted to implement a stopgap measure to help with people roaming through the offices and attending meetings.
 Setup is as follows: users can connect to a Wi-Fi as guests through a captive portal and after that connect to the VPN if they need to take their PC away from their table and cable. Works fine, but people moan about logging in twice to get to work. I would say it's not that big of a deal, but if I can help someone out, why not?
 On our vWLC I've set up a pre-auth ACL allowing connections to our VPN endpoint. While I get hits on it, AnyConnect gives out a message:
  
The service provider in your current location is restricting access to the Internet. You need to log on with the service provider before you can establish a VPN session. You can try this by visiting any website with your browser.
  
Fine, I must've forgotten to add something that's also needed, let's try with "permit any any" line... Gets hits, still can't connect or browse the web.
 I've tried it with my phone and with my laptop, same experience. According to WLC clients are in "Security Policy L3 WebAuth In Progress" stage which seems fine (and timeout is set to the max amount which is 4 hours).
 Anyone had a problem like this and solved it? I have no idea what else I should be doing to make this work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is quite an odd issue I'm having and I'm not even sure it's the right place but here we go...
 I am an electrical engineer and I worked in a program called SKM. In order to access it I have a USB stick that acts as a network license. It is plugged into my PC, my PC sees it, and when I open the software it checks to make sure before allowing access. I pay for a few seats of these software, all of which run through the USB network license. It maintains count of how many people are accessing it.
 I have a few remote employees who VPN into my network. In order to access the software they change a few settings in the SKM files per their (SKMs) direction, log into the VPN, and it sees the license, good to go. Except one employee.
 For some reason this one employee cannot "see" the network license once he is logged into the VPN. I went over to his house, brought my laptop, connected to the VPN, only to have the same issue. My laptop could not "see" the license either. 
 I have spoke at length with SKM about the issue and have tried every recommendation on their end. They have simply chalked it up to some network issue, which I'm beginning to agree with after troubleshooting. 
 The license uses something to check and i go to localhost:1947 to check. Not sure what this changes, just stating it as a fact. I've tried looking into the network adapter settings, etc. but I really don't know if what I do will help as I'm not that informed on networking issues. 
 For the record, server side and user side firewalls are all off. Other employees do not have this issue, and neither do I when I am remote from my main office location. I am pretty green in this and know enough just to get into trouble, so be nice if the solution is something simple/stupid.
 ​
 Can anyone recommend any other steps to check or files/checkboxes to look into? TIA

As you can see in the design, we have drawn a separate block for CCTV network. There would be approx. 400+ cameras (indoor & outdoor) with high quality imaging throughout the building. When designing this network, we thought would it be better to implement a three-tier network access, distribution layer and core just for CCTV block. But the rest of the campus network remain collapsed 2-tier network
 In the end I'm only asking this:
 Would you implement a such architecture? Does it make a difference if we just separate the access for CCTV and connect them to just Cores and eliminate the distribution part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm working on a fairly large enterprise network (3000ish users under this core) and currently I'm having trouble with our core node. There's a whole bunch of other stuff happening with it (like how I can't ping any VSI - even if they're up) but the most baffling to me is that I can't ping the loopback address at all. 
 It's a Cisco 3850 stack with 7 members. 1 master, 1 standby, and 5 line cards. I have Loopback0 configured with an IP of 10.0.255.4 and no matter what, I cannot ping it. Even if I console into the router and use 
 ping 10.0.255.4 source Lo0 
 it times out. Isn't the loopback supposed to be working, even if nothing else is? All it has is the ip address command in its config. 
 Additionally, I can't ping ANY VSI on the device, even though all of them are up. We have a few dozen and they've all been working as expected, but starting this morning we can't ping any of them. Here's an example :
  Interface Vlan148 ip address 10.0.148.1 255.255.255.192 no ip redirects no ip unreachables no ip proxy-arp  
 There's also some netflow commands but they're long and I didn't really feel like typing them out. I doubt they're relevant. 
 Anyway, a computer under Vlan148 (148.17) cannot ping its gateway (148.1) yet it DOES have full access to the whole network internal and outbound. I'm completely lost. 
 Even more weirdly, the device (when console'd in) can't ping anything itself, yet still sends SNMP logs, registers devices in the arp cache, creates OSPF neighbor entries, etc. 
 This is just so strange. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 EDIT: Partially resolved the issue. Turns out VRRP was causing this somehow, as disabling the VSIs that use VRRP fixed the issue. Tomorrow I'll have to figure out why exactly VRRP did this, but for now, it's resolved.

Before even being caught up to speed he's been constantly trying to gut all the solutions we currently have in place and replace them with solutions that he's familiar with. To an extent it's understandable but largely seems like he's trying to pass business off to friends but that's a different conversation lol. 
 One of the solutions he's trying to implement is Ivanti which is understandable for MDM/UEM. Though he's trying to implement other solutions of theirs that they don't really excel at. Mainly for the reason of just having everything under one solution provider. I'm more of the mindset of choosing the best solution for that specific need (i.e. MDM, SIEM, AV, VPN). Each company and their requirements typically vary which requires a more tailored approach rather than a blanket it one. 
 My question is pretty simple; What's your experience with Ivanti? 
 I'm trying to understand the company/solution and it's pros/cons so that I can go into the next conversation with the ammo I need to setup the company for success. Whether that be understanding the benefits and going with Ivanti or arguing against it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To cut to the chase, the company I'm working for (~50 people fintech startup) is moving to a new location, and I (sysadmin, but practically responsible for anything IT related) am supposed to be in charge of moving our entire wiring and network infrastructure. To be honest I'm quite intimidated by the task, not only because the previous IT manager (who initially set everything up) did not leave any proper documentation, but also because I just graduated college last year, and I'm only in my current position because said manager left and the company has been unwilling to hire someone to replace him. In other words, I severely lack both experience and guidance. 
 So far, it looks like I have two options:
  
Convince the company to hire the previous manager as a contractor to help with the move. The negotiation will likely be difficult, since the higher-ups still have some ill feelings towards him. But in my (unexperienced) opinion, he should know best about what's going on with our setup.
 Hire an IT service provider. I have never worked with one, so I am unfamiliar with pricing etc, or whether it's even standard for them to take on something like this. 
  
Basically... what the heck should I do?
 Any advice would be appreciated.

At first I thought they might be specifically for LACP, but it appears you can put any ports on the switch in a LAG. Also, if you run the "show port" command, it shows 28 ports, not 24, and you can put them into different VLANs. For example, you can have port 24 in VLAN 100 and port 28 in VLAN 105. 
 TLDR; are there functionally 24 ports on this switch, or 28?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have to re-IP an entire data center network and I'm wondering if a high-end DC switch can provide 2 VLAN IP addresses on 1 port. Basically put 2 IP addresses on 1 server ethernet port and then turn off the retiring IP from that interface. If this could be done it would save us a lot of pain with having to have both a tech on our side and a DC tech involved in over a thousand servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has a fictionalized account of the development of Spotify called The Playlist. The story is told through the eyes of different stake holders: The founder, the music industry, a lawyer, including an Engineer. While fictionalized, the series does seem to be based on real characters, real events, and what seems to be real tech issues/hurdles. 
 Spoiler alert if you want to watch this. One of the technical breakthroughs per the story seems to be using lossy streaming where they accept a small amount of packet loss in order to avoid latency. I presumed all streaming services do this, but of course Spotify development started in the mid-ish 2000’s and maybe they were one of the first. At any rate, the engineer proclaims this a wholly new protocol that they have patented. But isn’t lossy streaming simply UDP? Can anyone speak to what protocol Spotify supposedly patented (assuming the patent is not also fictionalized)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All - we are moving from an onsite data room in a corporate office to a colocated facility. What are people doing these days as best practice? Are you just leaving a Firewall with an Ethernet switch and a UPS for the corporate users users to join a LAN while doing site-site VPN to the data center with a xfinity line or is there some new hotness to get this done? SD-WAN seems overkill for us.
 ​
 The corporate office is very close to a data center in Atlanta so ping would be <15ms. User count in the office would be 15 tops, and they currently all use (including all of our servers) a single 100/100Mbit line confirmed with no congestion issues. New data center connection to the world would be gigabit, so plenty of bandwidth there.
 Do people still typically leave behind a DC and a NAS? Nothing but a firewall? Direct connect? We run light SQL loads, AD and VOIP, that's about it. There are two other corporate offices in the US connected via site-site VPN and the other sites are OUs in Active Directory. In each site, there is a physical DC as well as virtual on esxi - and esxi obviously hosts all of our servers in each site. There is no shared storage for esxi, it's all local to each site. Considering moving to RD Gateway model for the users who have been used to local LAN speeds for all applications as some are a bit rough via WAN (such as document management).
 Thanks for any ideas!

 We have been running with multiple USW 24 switches, however we are in need of something a bit more reliable.
 No fancy features is needed. 
 Must have: -Double AC PSU slots (replaceable) -2x SFP gbe ports -PVST/VSTP -24x gbe rj45 ports (a poe alternative would also be good) -rackable -preferably fanless
 Do you guys have any recommendations for pure l2 switches that have atleast the above specs?
 My budget is about 1k euro per switch (preferably less) :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, I think this is a straightforward question. I have a location in my EIGRP WAN topology with a secondary WAN link. I want this secondary link to advertise the LAN networks learned from the local L3 LAN switches, but I want to use the reliability metric at this duel circuit location to make routes advertised from the secondary links a feasible successor. 
 All Routers in the EIGRP WAN are only configured to consider the Default metrics (BANDWIDTH/LOAD) when calculating the best path.
 Now, describing this in writing has already made me feel like the answer is "no" because the other EIGRP neighbors would not use this new metric when calculating the best path. It may make more sense to modify the LOAD metric. I think this would mean the routes may not be installed as feasible successors, but they would be used if the primary Router failed. 
 What are your thoughts and ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 Last year I was hired as a sysadmin after having succeeded as a sysadmin elsewhere. I replaced one who had basically given up at the role and let things go well beyond unmanaged. I spent the first 6 months improving every process I could, and met every project I was given. After that I thought of a few projects that I could work on that didn’t require any budget changes, since anything involving a cost I get stonewalled on. 
 But now it’s a year later, and as systems admin I still don’t have access to many of our systems. I don’t have access to our email spam filter. And when I’m on group calls involving my management I’m hardly given a chance to speak, and they do my work on the call instead of letting me, making me feel like I’m in some sort of placeholder position. 
 Having the title longer on my resume is nice, and work/life balance and the pay is okay. But I don’t feel like I’m respected or trusted to have the tools to do my job here. 
 It’s gotten to the point where I’ve begun collecting evidence of my requests that go unanswered, so if I’m ever terminated I can prove I didn’t have what I needed to succeed. Do you think it’s better that I stick it out for another year for that job history/resume experience, or should I look to leave as I’m really no longer learning or able to work on progressing my career here? I am studying to take some cyber security certs to help pad the resume though.

 So let's say in June the software vendor releases v1.0 of their software. Create the GPO and deploy the MSI, easy.
 In August they release v1.2 and you need to upgrade everybody. Are you supposed to:
  
Add another installer to the same GPO, leaving the original so that the new one is an "upgrade" to the previous version, or
 
Remove the previous installer, allowing it to remain on old machines and then add the new installation package.
 
 There are articles everywhere about making the initial software deployment, however, it seems nearly impossible to find anything on upgrading an installation.

After I got into the field and started earning I slowly lost that focus. I mean I work really hard and focused at the office because I freaking love IT but I can't focus to study. 
 I want to do a few certifications and even get my master's but sitting down and studying is like torture now. Even tutorials don't work. I get terribly (even intentionally) distracted all the time. I believe it's because we are so used to stimulation when we work in IT (screens, terminals, GUIs, incidents), our brain gets bored when we study. Does that make sense? Have any of you encountered this? How do you focus on studying for certs when your brain says "nooooooo!"? How do you get that 'student mindset' back and focus?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand the purpose and effect of certificates within Trusted Root Certification Authorities, Intermediate Certification Authorities & Trusted Publishers...but what about the others (Enterprise Trust, Trusted Devices, Web Hosting)?
 Are these all purely for personal preference/organization purposes, as in it doesn't really matter if you have your certificates exist in "Personal" or any of these sub-folders? For example, I know Remote Desktop authentication certificates can be placed in "Personal" (machine store) and RDP connections will utilize the certificate even without the certificate existing in the "Remote Desktop" sub-folder.
 The reason I'm asking is that I'm needing to move some domain Server/Computer related certs out of the "Personal" folder to somewhere more appropriate and was wondering if the "Enterprise Trust" folder would be the right place for those?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, me and my colleagues cannot come to a clear conclusion on this, we have some clients that are experiencing connectivity troubles when trying to use an IKEv2 VPN, the culprit seems to be a MTU size issue.
 The solution would be to change the MTU size but, we're split on where we want to perform the change. Me and some others advocate that after a PPPoE session is established between a CPE and the BNG the traffic is ethernet so the mtu size should be changed on the interface we use for eBGP peering. 
 Others insist that is enough to change it on the bba-group that is applied to the template on the BNG.
 I am not sure why that would help, could anyone help clear things up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to clean up my Group Policy .admx and .adml files but I am having trouble telling which folder and files are actually being used by AD GPO. Is there not a way to find the object path of a referenced GPO? I basically have duplicate files and want to remove them.
 My current folder structure on the domain controller looks like this:
  
Root folder with GPOs: \dc-1\SYSVOL\domain.com\Policies
 Then under that directory, I have about 80 folders that look like this {12A244F0-51EA-4C20-A1BA-68DF5BEA7E8E} and a PolicyDefinitions folder.
 Then, in PolicyDefinitions, I have about 400 .adml and .admx files and then a folder called en-US which has about 500 .adml and .admx files in it too.
  
I noticed when updating ADMX templates, if I over-write any, then I usually get errors when navigating the policies in the Group Policy Management snap-in. It will say something like the GPO is missing, then just restore the original GPO files from a backup copy of the folder I made to fix it.
 Note: I don't want to delete all unused GPOs, I just want to delete the duplicates from the unused folder (whichever one that is). I understand that some GPOs wont be in use but that I also dont want to delete them because then they wont be available.

None of the servers are accessible from the internet and it all exist on internal namespaces. All of my servers and desktops internally can get to the CRLs.
 I have had two sites using internet web server certificates getting flagged by Chrome with the error "NET::ERR_CERT_UNABLE_TO_CHECK_REVOCATION" while Edge is seemingly fine. Additionally, the error doesn't present itself on Chrome for all users. The same person could walk up to two machines and get the error on only one, and a profile wipe will fix the error completely for a while. 
 I can load the certificate, copy the AIA and CRL locations and download them just fine. I have check pkiview.msc for any troubles and everything looks fine, I can't seem to find any issue with the PKI infrastructure. 
 Chrome and Edge seem to be acting differently while unmanaged Firefox doesn't like anything signed by my internal PKI. Would there be any additional logs I can check to find out why Chrome is complaining about not being able to check the CRL and/or can someone help me understand CRLSets and if they might be the problem?

 I need to set up a camera system for a recording studio I'm working for. They want to install PTZ cameras in the whole studio, as well as monitors in two of the rooms, so that the monitors can show any feed taken from any cameras in the studio.
 I was thinking about buying Video Encoders & Decoders and PTZ Hdmi Cameras:
 Camera HDMI Out --> Encoder --> Network --> Decoder in the other room --> Monitor HDMI In 
 But that means that for every camera, I need to buy an encoder. And that gets expensive really quick.
 My question: Could I buy a camera with an ethernet port and plug it in the network directly, then retrieve the feed with the decoder to show on the monitors? Or is an encoder mandatory to be able to do that? Do you guys maybe have an easier solution to this?
 Thanks a lot, really appreciate the help.

 Backup Router 11.11.11.3
 Client is 11.11.11.21 with gateway 11.11.11.1. 
 When Client visit website, there is HTTPS traffic incoming. 
 What I see is that the Client recieve HTTPs traffic from 11.11.11.1 MAC-address. But ALSO recieves the HTTPs traffic from 11.11.11.2 MAC-address. 
 Is that wrong? I expected that the MAC-address of VRRP interface would be used downstream. And not sometimes the active-router MAC-address.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[... and I am baffled that I did. I tell my clients all the time to be careful with suspicious mails. And I guess this time I wasn't careful enough. 
 The original mail seemed to originate from their web hosting provider stating a new invoice was ready for download and contained an HTML file as an attachment which should be the invoice itself. It was forwarded twice within their org, then to me with a request for credentials to access that site since it prompted for them. The website was an absolute perfect replica of the genuine login site and prompted for credentials. I filled it out planing to download the invoice and send it to them, since I knew the sender didn't have them. However the login didn't work. After checking the url I was on the correct site of the provider. What I didn't notice at first: I only got redirected there after entering the credentials. For some reason I got suspicious at that point and checked the HTML file which contained some encrypted java script. Of course I immediately changed the password of the account and fortunately found no suspicious activity. 
 However I am still in shock how stupidly I behaved.
 Edit: just to add, that Mail did not trigger any spam filter nor did opening the HTML file trigger the antivirus or the webfilter of our firewall.
 Edit 2: just uploaded the file to Virustotal and it seems it's actually a trojan. However it's still undetected by our antivirus solution. This file was first uploaded to Virustotal a week ago.

 First, the story, since starting in my role the team has used a shared excel file to manage our IP Space, we have over 300 Remote sites and 4 DCs... and one Excel file. I had mentioned time and time that eventually we're going to go out, build a site, and accidentally use the IP Space that has already been reserved for a different site. Well, the day came, we had our 3rd Party go out and deploy the site as per our instructions, and bang, one of our other sites went offline. Two sites had been deployed using the same Subnet. The team did their testing, PVT passed and they left for the day. Staff started moving in the next day. I then get a P2 the next day, site down, I can't login, and everything down. ISP says they see their side online. Then.. it all comes rushing in, it hits me and all I can do is just sigh take and sip of my coffee.
 So with that, all told and shared, what do we all use? I have only used phpIPAM before, it worked but it wasn't great and crashed a bit.. I'm hoping to purchase something, easy to setup easy to use, and easy to maintain, the golden 3. phpIPAM was none of those things.

 What we found out us that as soon as we remove the docking connection we get prompted to connect to wi-fi and then autopilot kicks in.
 The wi-fi is public so we looked at our firewall logs to see if the fact that deployment get stuck only when on LAN connection is caused by firewall but we don’t see any blocks.
 Is there anyway I can get to some logging on the laptop to see why it is stuck?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hopefully there is someone familiar with the ESE/JET engine who could confirm about cleaning up ESE database transaction log files.
 One AD CS CA is having a rather large C:\Windows\system32\CertLog directory with numerous ESE log files. It seems to be a rather known issue that AD CS does not (sometimes?) clean up the ESE log files, for example:
 https://www.sysadmins.lv/blog-en/database-log-files-are-not-truncated-when-you-perform-a-full-certification-authority-database-backup.aspx
 The reference is contradicting itself. It says "no workaround" but also gives a command that "identifies the start log file number to protect". I had already figured out about as much by using esentutl but would like to confirm I am getting this right.
 In the above linked example all logs with sequence number smaller than 3B, meaning edb00001.log until edb0003B.log could be removed, right? What about edb.log, that one must not be touched? Or one cannot just delete any log file and have a working database?
 It should be rather simple to make a script that:
  
Run esentutl /mk edb.chk
 Parse the Checkpoint line for sequence ID
 Delete all edb#####.log files with ##### smaller than value from step 2
  
I have been searching for a while and could not find one website about actually doing this. Surely someone must have done this before, it does not even look that complicated?! Several hits for just brutely stopping certsvc and deleting all logs which is not what I want to do if this can be done "right", by just deleting unnecessary log files.
 I guess I could just download the whole CertLog and play around with it, see what happens. Will take a while, it being multi-GB...

They drain so much energy out of me and send me into loops just to "fix" software problems, which are 99% hardware problems and we just need someone to change the parts that's it. I have such a hard time to get through to those people even though I try to fix everything software related beforehand, but the support always wants more from me. 
 How do you guys deal with customer support? My manager says I should be harsh, but I don't feel like being rude to a guy who is just doing their job and fend off stupid problems. Maybe I am just too soft, I am lost at this point.

 As I see from my researches, we are now back at scripting the network file share connection but now with PowerShell?
 So even in scripting: We move from a Net Use "One Liner" to a 317 Line PowerShell Script which adds a local task for reconnecting a single drive? (using https://intunedrivemapping.azurewebsites.net/).
 Maybe I am thinking the wrong way, because modern management and cloud is totally different but:

 Are there any downsides to using the two 1310nm transceivers on both ends? 1310nm seems to be better

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it´s not about their printer line, that topic has a special place in my "not to be opened again" box. 
 It´s been nearly two decades since I last bought any HP product for good reason but as life goes on and people think it´s ok to purchase HP products I have to troubleshoot them. 
 First the server guy got blamed - me. 
 Than the network guy got blamed - me. 
 Than the software got blamed. So I made contact with the vendor who told me that the network guy needs to get his hands on the problem. The logs stated that also, at least the software ones. So I conceded and went back to troubleshoot even though I was pretty certain it´s not the network, most certainly not the server and probably not the software. It runs on several devices without any issues. 
 After another sleepless night it dawned to me that the only difference is, that the software is installed on a HP desk. So I grabbed just another device, slapped the software on and it runs. It just does, what it´s supposed to do, it works. So it´s the HP trash again. Why? I don´t know. I wish I could say that every single HP device is in it´s own contained part of the network, isolated from the rest of the world and hidden from any tech guy but they are everywhere and the rules applied are the same as for all the other stuff. The one and only difference is, they are HP desks. 
 I honestly don´t know who made the cost-benefit analysis or if there even is one, but I´d like to see which maniac decided to buy HP products.

 Awhile back, I found this random script online made by David Barrett - I think this is the single most powerful and complete script I've ever found via ze google lifeline.
 I encourage you to read the github and check it out for yourself.
 Merge MailboxFolders.ps1 · David-Barrett-MS/PowerShell-EWS-Scripts Wiki · GitHub 
 ​
 I just really wanted to take a moment and publicly thank this guy - Hopefully he reads r/sysadmin
 You could package this script into a full app and make a fortune -- instead, this guy updates and provides this script for free for anyone to benefit.
 and sure enough, it supports oauth/modern auth
 Thank You David Barrett. You have saved quite possibly hundreds of hours of my life.

 I work remotely so physically seeing and talking and getting to know your local sysadmin is even harder than it is.
 I had simple questions to ask him to gain some personal perspective on how he got to where he is now.
 And I was immediately shot down by my supervisor, being told to please do not contact him, only supervisors and up can do that.
 And you know what? I sorta get it. I would imagine having 10s or even 100s of agents contacting you could get tiring.
 But it still sucks that I'm pretty much forbidden to gain a little wisdom from him. Oh well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a tad confused by Microsoft's documentation on this topic.... I'm looking at doing a proof of concept for a possible project to migrate ALL user, group, resource data from one tenant to another and there appears to be two different pathways - both updated within the last 6 months by Microsoft and neither has any reference to the other (with the exception of recommended content).
 ​
  
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrate-mailboxes-across-tenants vs https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-mailbox-migration?view=o365-worldwide 
  
 ​
 Which is the better method?
 Notes: 
 The primary domain in the source tenant will remain as the primary domain for the users migrated into the target (and ONLY for these users, everyone else already on the target tenant will use the company's normal domain).
 The source tenant is only 3 months old but user accounts contain data and calendars migrated from an on-prem Kerio server.
 Both tenants have their own Mimecast Email Gateway, but after migration is complete, there will be only the target's Mimecast service.

Our network operates on a far greater scale than anything I've studied so I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction for a resource I can read to help me get up to speed. 
 So long story short... At the CCNA level there is not much BGP required. As long as you know "its the routing protocol of the internet" your about good... Well anyways we have our core and 2 wan edge devices. These wan edge devices have tunnels to each of our some 300+ locations. Each location has a BGP AS number... all in the 65000 private range (at least as far as I understand it). 
 So I guess what I'm asking is does anyone have a resource I can read and study up on using BGP as a primary internal routing protocol? I have googled iBGP but man... the amount of info out there is nuts. It's so much to the point I dont even know where to begin reading...
 Thanks in advance.

 Please share with me something :/ I have been just a hobbyist in computers since I was a kid, I guess. Building my first computer at a young age, growing in to help-desk after flipping them burgers for X years after college.. A typical story, I assume...
 Was on helpdesk in large org for 5 years, now I have been a SysAdmin for a year and some change (Age 31) and I have been overwhelmed by the sheer infinite amount of things you need to learn. My feelings gravitate to 'why am I even doing this?'..
 My boss is amazing. My team is amazing. I have finally landed a kush job with a description that I thought I always wanted (small shop now doing some networking, security wherever, being new to virtualization, everything a sysadmin would do with an IT team of 3 in the datacenter and 300 employees).
 My motivation is fucked. Every day I want to do good for my co-workers and boss but I just don't feel like I have it in me to learn and think and be creative every day... I just had a very overdue vacation a few months ago and I already have this burnout feeling.. whyyyy.. I question if I am even interested in IT.. working in the dirt or cleaning toilets can NOT be a better deal for me but it is what I fantasize about. something mindless...but idk.. I can continue to rant but I think anyone reading this get's the point. Work is getting hard and I want to be motivated.
 (Possible remedy? Can changing my habits and routine give me a better outlook? ie start waking up earlier and getting some exercise. Can I coax my mind in to enjoying this job by employing other changes in different parts of my life?)

 Have had a s2s tunnel built between site a & site b for quite some time... never seemed to be a super big issue, performed well, but lately I feel like there are times where bandwidth is just yuck... I know it's a broad question, but I have a maybe 7 subnets going across this to 3 or 4 other subnets at the secondary location. AES256 and SHA256 for algorithms with DH14. Not sure if this is a factor? But looking to understand if this is a best solution for site to site locations still or if there is something else I should be pursuing... This area is not my number 1 - so forgive me. Both units are Fortigate. Both sites are on 1000/1000 fiber... Just seems like I can count to 4 before I see anything load up like an SMB query on a file server... etc... but latency between sites is a solid 5ms....

 I've been team team for over a decade and can afford them but recently, I've seen more and more problems with them. I even had a bug that TAC said "We will wait until someone reports this bug to see if code comes out to fix it" when THEY discovered the bug with me while working on the case. I asked if THEY might be the right team to report said bug and they blew me off. I don't need anything crazy -10G uplinks, 48-1G ports, stackable. Right now I'm running 9200 switches and was looking for recommendations. 
 I'm leaning toward HP/Aruba but need to dig into which model is closest to these 9200s and want to stay away from anything that handcuffs you with licensing (I.E. charges you to make a 1G port a 10G). Any recommendations? I'll end up with about 350 spread out across all of my remote sites so I wanted to buy a few now and plug them in on an upcoming small project to get some time with them. Thanks in advance!

I'm in my first semester of college (computer technology) and just got a job as a network technician by dumb luck. One of my first tasks is to get an old managed HP 1910 switch up and running to be added to the network. I have a brand new USB to rj45 console cable. I'm using putty with serial connection enabled. Bits per second 38400. Data bits 8. Stop bits 1. With both parity and flow control set to none. Com 3 is the only serial line that pulls up a terminal. However the terminal is blank and after waiting 10+ mins multiple times and even power cycling during the terminal or before trying to connect, I am unable to get any text to appear on the terminal screen. Am I missing something? I'm feeling kinda dumb here. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

 There is Cat6 cabling between my MDF and IDF. It's OK for now but an opportunity presented itself to have fiber run between them at almost no extra cost as part of another project. I don't have any equipment right now that would be using it so it would be kind of future proofing and would be nice to have an option of 10Gig as I can easily see that being asked for in the future. Now, having never used fiber before I'm not sure what fiber should be run? I was asked if I want single- or multi-mode. What should I choose? I traditionally stick with Cisco switches, in case this is important and the distance between the locations is at most 200 ft. Are there any other questions that I should ask at this time or when I'm ready to use that link?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know using them is frowned upon but I am curious. 
 Does MAC address whitelisting (I one this is also not good, but 802.1x is not on the table for a while) configured on firewall still work for devices that connect to unmanaged switch, like desktop connected to netgear 8 port desk switch over Ethernet?
 My company can’t afford wiring new lines right now and we have some machines that can’t use Wi-Fi, they must be plugged in. The topic of unmanaged switches came up. 
 If I can at least whitelist devices on the firewall to allow/deny computers that plug into the unmanaged switch it would be ok for a little bit.
 Would love to hear what everyone thinks about it!

 Have a PC that needs to talk to a device over IPV6. Hooked the PC to the device using ethernet and attempted to set a static IPv6 address. 
 Device has a static IP of fe80::def set up by manufacturer. Don't have an option to change this. Attempted to set static IP on computer to fe80:abc, prefix to 64, and default gateway to fe80::1.
 Whenever I leave the ethernet properties page the static IP reverts to automatic IPV6 address rather than static. Any idea what I am missing?

She called just to say thank you and she really appreciated the support I had given her while I was there, and that was it.
 She was just one of the 300ish users I supported, never had any extensive dealings with her, never anything beyond answering the phone/Teams when she called for support.
 Meanwhile, the guy who owned the company, the guy who was supposedly my boss to whom I was supposed to report to, after keeping his company running 24/7 for all those years never talked to me while I was there, "negotiated" with me when I turned in my notice by sending verbal messages through somebody who then relayed them through HR who then verbally passed the message to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early last week PC across our org starting having one of three types of error:
 1 - PC would BSOD, possibly multiple times with no obvious cause and disparate error codes
 2 - Every application would crash in turn with an error indicating issues with Trend Micro's dlls
 3 - PC would boot to a black screen, but be online (even on wifi) and respond to remote commands (though any form of remote control would still yield a black screen)
 Eventually issues 1 and 2 would evolve into 3 in many, though not all cases. An upgrade of TM's client was complete or in progress at the time of the first presentation, which coupled with issue 2 made us conclude a botched update was the cause.
 Unfortunately repair didn't seem to work and TM's support suggested we proceed with a hard uninstall using their CUT program. The problem was this took an extremely long time (over a day in one notable case). We dug through the logs and discovered CUT was attempting dozens of tries with long timeouts for each operation, before eventually failing and moving to a more aggressive option (ie removing a service after failing to stop it).
 We discovered that an ini file was created upon launching the CUT executable and we could, if we were quick enough, replace that ini file with a modded one that reduced timeouts and # of attempts to something more manageable. This brought down removal time from hours to about 20 minutes per machine, which could be run in parallel.
 On some machines CUT would complete on first try, others would require a second application even though CUT logged its successful completion.
 After that we could reinstall the TM client with no further issue.
 TM support told us this has never happened before (when does it ever) and we're the only ones reporting it (what good luck), so I thought it'd be useful to put it here for anyone that should happen to suffer this issue or something similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone had any success reinstalling/resetting Windows Defender in Windows 10?
 We use crowdstrike as our main AV but would like to start using scheduled scanning on our devices per recommendations from our SoC.
 Our devices are in Intune, and I’ve found out that Defender will automatically run in “passive Mode” if we onboard our devices to Defender for Endpoint.
 This works fine on our newer deployed devices (via autopilot), but it won’t work on our previous ones that were “imaged” using MDT. I have a feeling that the previous image broke defender somehow since it included crowdstrike on the install, rather than installing after enrolling via autopilot in the new deployment.
 I’ve tried the commands I’ve found online to reset the app using AppX, re-registering it again using add-appx using the built in windows 10 manifest.xml, and resetting the app via “Windows Settings”. I’ve also tried restarting the Windows Defender service, modifying registry entries to enable “passive mode”, and simply enabling periodic scanning on the device itself. Windows defender seem to just won’t start at all. I checked group policy and Defender is not blocked.
 Any other ideas you guys may have to get defender running again? I could try uninstalling crowdstrike, but thats not really feasible if it’s the only way to deploy it on our older devices.

 I'm not talking about learning an app (for example Chef and building cookbooks) or generic stuff like automation (for example learning Python for scripting). I'm thinking like where will AI be or quantum computing and what kinds of roles there will be for the admins.
 Big industry-changing stuff like when Windows 95 came on the scene and the world hustled to move to distributed systems hiring anyone who could spell PC. Or when Amazon released commercial cloud computing and suddenly the "cloud engineer" title was the fat paycheck.
 Or maybe I just say screw it to cutting-edge tech and get a job supporting the Mainframe and COBOL? That stuff will be around long after I'm retired. Plus from what I see folks to support that is in very high demand.

 Im a entry-Level Sys-Admin and doing a Server upgrade at my workplace right now.
 We are switching from a Terra 7220 G1 to a 7220 G4, and are using VMware for Virtualisation.
 The G1 runs ESXI 5.5, which I plan to Upgrade to 6.5/6.7 before migrating the VMs to the G4 Server, which is expected to run ESXI 7.X on it.
 ​
 Therefore i need to know wheter my Hardware is compatibel with ESXI 6.5
 I already went to Vmware Hardware compatibility Guide to check it, but the list ends with a Terra G2 modell. 
 ​
 Does anyone know how to find out if my G1 is compatibel?
 Its equiped with 2x Intel Xeon E5-2600-v2 Series, which are supported by ESXI 6.5/6.7.
 Or do you think I should just try to upgrade?

Exchange picks up on it and blocks the legitimate email from sending emails since it is flagging it as spam. This disables and user and the only way to get around it is to create a rule in Exchange with a "body contains" rule. We use MWB Nebula to locate vulnerabilities and I do not see one on our Exchange server. I am a Jr. System Admin so Cybersecurity is something I am learning.

 Also i could put MBR2GPT.exe to a MECM task sequence which boots into WinPE, converts the disk and shuts down, which is convenient.
 Has anyone faced a similar issue? How did you solve it? How to automate this as much as possible so that EFI partition is first on the disk?

 Can anyone tell me how "User Account Control: Detect application installations and prompt for elevation" actually works?
 Enabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install are detected and the user is prompted for administrative credentials.
 Disabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install aren't detected and the user isn't prompted for administrative credentials.
 ​
 Microsoft says to set it to whatever fits my environment, CIS Benchmark says to enable it. But: Auditor actually recommends disabling it.
 So, which one is more secure? Does "Disabled" mean additional packages are simply not installed at all or does it install them without a UAC prompt?

 So heres the scenario: Our client has Active Directory, and we implemented Folder Redirection via GPO for all users (even AppData) and now it creates so many problems that i have no idea what to do. 
 For example: User is logged out from apps whenever he logs on other computer. He logs with his domain user on one PC then logs off and then logs on the other computer. When he logs off and comes back to his main pc and logs onto it, he is logged out in every app he was logged in. Google Chrome doesn't work properly, sometimes it doesn't even want to open.
 Do I remove AppData from Folder Redirection? Are there any other solutions that allow to load Users Profile on different computers? Maybe Folder Redirection should be completely removed?
 If i missed something that you need to help me, tell me in the comments, English isn't my first language so sorry about that.

The machine was then turned on at the weekend and has updated to Windows 11 for the 3rd time.
 Their server is 2012R2 so we're trying to keep the machines on Windows 10 until the new one is installed, does anyone have other methods of blocking the updates? I have been informed that installing the ADMX to try the group policy method just caused other issues with the server, which is why I went down the registry route.

 I've seen this problem for quite some time and always ignored but I guess it's time to figure out how to fix it. So I'm looking for any advice on how to proceed with fixing it once and for all.
 Here's what I've looked into:
  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Preload has correct number of keyboard layouts - the two I've set (00000409 and 00000419, English and russian) - as expected
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Keyboard Layout\Preload has English only (00000409) - as expected
 
In settings > time and language > language I only have two languages selected, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
powershell's Get-WinUserLanguageList returns two languages, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
 And yet, there are three keyboard layouts to select from in tray - being two I've selected and 1 extra called QAA, which is basically English.
 Logging out and back in again doesn't fix it. Rebooting doesn't fix it. The only way to fix it is to override current settings - either using powershell or manually resetting up all that. But problem appears again sooner or later - maybe next reboot or maybe 4 months in - appears to be random.
 Googling leads nowhere as all there either temporal fixes that I've mentioned or common useless advice like "run sfc scannow"
 Has anyone figured out how to get rid of that problem permanently?

 Is there a way to remotely force a physical drive into down state on a Dell SCv3020 array?
 One disk in the array has very high (>300ms) latency and filling the log with "[Aborted]" messages but for whatever reason the array controller hasn't taken the disk out of the RAID. The high latency on one disk is breaking everything connected to the array.
 I can only find "Release Disk" in Storage Manager but that is trying to rebalance the RAID by moving the data away from the failing disk which will take a very long time.
 I'd like to force the disk into failed state without rebalancing. I know I could pull the disk, but I'm trying to avoid a long car journey.

We can bring in unmanaged devices on their network and our software works fine but it's only when we try and connect using their managed devices do we get blocked. 
 We've disabled their Sophos AV, apparently they've had a look at their inbound/outbound ports on Windows Defender and can't see any blocks on 7100 so my question is - how else can we find out what's blocking this port? Any scanning tools that will point us to some kind of GPO or other application block?

 I'm unable to setup the Process Explorer to run at startup via Task Scheduler. Regardless if I create the task via the Process Explorer menu 'Run at startup' or manually I am unable to make it work.
 I've installed Systeinternals via winget: ````
  
winget list sysinternals
 Name Id Version Source
 Sysinternals Suite 9P7KNL5RWT25 2022.10.1.0 msstore ````
  
Running the task does nothing and there are no errors in the task history log. It is as if nothing happens. 'Run with highest privileges' also does nothing What I find very odd about the installation is that procexp.exe is a 0kb file in the Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps folder. It has no icon but I can run it normally by double-clicking on it. However if I use Task Scheduler and I try to selected it (via Browser on Actions) I get the following error:  procexp.exe The file cannot be accessed by the system. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[we've recently started to move our default deployed image to win11. We've since noticed that activation is behaving weird and so far i cannot get to the bottom of whats going on.
 We deploy our image via ConfMgr. Enterprise version is selected from the iso as a untouched image. All our changes are done via GPO or CM after the iso. Originally it did not have a key defined (overlooked/assumed AD KMS would take over), but thats now been corrected in the Task Sequence.
 I stumbled on the fact my laptop is one thats affected; it's using the Pro retail key thats burnt into UEFI. ok - no problem; slmgr /upk, /ipk {GVLK}, /ato and /dli to confirm. /dli shows the expected KMS activation from AD. Great, job done i'll get that pushed out to existing clients via a Task Sequence that runs those same commands. A week later i noticed my laptop is back to the pro licence (i reboot weekly; sleep the laptop during the week)
 redo the slmgr process, reboot and now the key has reverted back to the pro retail key again.
 has anyone seen this behaviour or know why it's occuring?

 I am attempting to identify a specific planning tool that I have encountered in the past, but cannot for the life of me remember the name of. My Google foo seems to be pretty bad today as well.
 In summary, this is a tool published by a company (can’t remember the name) that allows you to pay an annual license fee to get access to part libraries from various vendors and then use these to build BOMs to submit to suppliers. I know it has libraries from Aruba, Cisco, Extreme, to name but a few. 
 Before anyone says it, I am not thinking about Visio or anything like that. This tool allows you to select e.g. an Aruba CX6300 switch and then can show you which addon modules are compatible with this switch and would then allow you build a complete BOM around this, including PSUs, SFP transceivers, interconnect cables, etc.
 Please, if anybody knows this tool, I am trying to identify it, as I need to submit budget approval for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi There , 
 ​
 ​
 I have a scenario and couple questions 
 ​
 Here is the following configuration of the two organizations:
 ​
 Organization 1:
 ​
 Exchange 2013 CU23
 ​
 Organization 2:
 ​
 Exchange 2016 CU19 & Hybrid 
 ​
 Both organizations have an internal connection between them and a Full Trust Relationship.
 ​
 ​
 I am very confused related to the Organization Relationships.
 ​
 I have found an article like below.
 ​
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/the-hybrid-mesh/ba-p/605910
 ​
 MS says:
 ​
  
Create an Organization Relationship between Contoso on-premises and Tailspin on-premises. Use a unique SMTP namespace for the domain name in the Organization Relationship like OnPrem.Tailspintoys.com
  
Note: In most environments, the shared namespace “TailspinToys.com” can be used as the Target address for on-premises users and you would not need the additional namespace of onprem.TailspinToys.com. However, to account for all complex partnerships that could be in place, a unique namespace used as the target address will ensure free busy works properly.
 ​
 Note: The domain name “TailspinToys.com” is not present in any of the Organization Relationships in the Contoso environment. Keeping this name out of the Organization Relationship will ensure that you can continue to use the shared namespace and see free/busy information.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Do I have to use unique address like OnPrem.companyb.com? Because We dont have any DNS record such as OnPrem.companyb.com. I want to use companyb.com as domain name for Organization Relationship between Company A on-premises and Company B on-premises.

 We are designing a network for our new medical center within the region. When designing a hierarchical network, we were having brainstorming discussion with internal engineering team to take a decide on using 3-tier network for Data Center and 2-Tier for Campus (endpoints and end devices)
 The center would occupy 2000+ endpoints in the network. We propose two main core switches, setup as VSS and aggregating approx. 70 access switches installed in different floors in the building communication rooms. Single stack contains 5 or 6 access switches with 10G uplinks to upstream core switches. Access are all L2, and we route between VLANs using SVIs on the core switches and some VLANs are firewalled for Guest and IoT devices.
 Pair of high specs firewalls connected to cores for perimeter (internet, wan & dmz) and internal segmentation (servers & end devices, depending on the use case and security controls requirements.
 Eventually, with regard to servers, we are thinking about having 3-tier network: access > distribution > main campus core
 Two distribution switches with Servers SVIs on them or Firewalls. 
 L2 links terminated on Cores with Point-to-Point transit VLAN. Servers connecting to TOR access switches. 
 Please share your thoughts and comments for 3-tier approach and feel free to add your invaluable inputs if anything is wrong in the design.

 Have 12 other ProCurve edge switches connecting to it with 2 or 3 1GbE trunks. It does my VLAN routing. All copper currently, might add fiber in a few years when we expand. Kept it simple. IP cameras are the top bandwidth devices. 
 I updated the firmware 400 days ago, which was the last reboot. I have a spare eBay 5412zl on a shelf for parts. 
 How much risk is involved with running a 10+ core switch? Am I crazy to run this another 5 years before replacing it? Do you see switches fail after 10+ years frequently?

It wouldn't let me as the img backup and the initial boot (loading the macrium iso) of the vm can't both be from the external hdd apparently? Just want to test and see if the backup works/is stable. Thanks all.
 ​
 EDIT: More info. I set the vm file location to the external hdd and when I tried to enable the physical usb external hdd to connect to the vm to load the disk img backup, an error popped up basically saying I can't do those 2 things from an external drive?? It wouldn't let me boot and recover the backup since if I enabled the physical external hdd to the vm to access the img backup, it would disable the external hdd to the main pc which is what the vm is running from. 
 Is there a way for the external hdd to work in the vm and with the main pc at the same time?
 ​
 Have I just missed something obvious? I am confused lol. 
 ​
 I must've done something wrong. Most people can't just boot up their backup on the internal drive because who has enough space for that? (Essentially 2 copies of a whole computer on the same drive) Mine is only 240gb, how do guys with maxed 3tb drives test their backups? Nobody just assumes their giant backup works?

 I generally try to be really civil, but sometimes the answer to an issue is so glaringly obvious, and becomes a real waste of time have to go through all the rigmarole to prove that the problem is a user problem, not a system/network/IT problem, that I feel I need to be a bit more blunt and not worry too much about how I'm coming across.
 To give you an example, just recently I had person in senior management raise a ticket because an important document couldn't be found on SharePoint. The ticket was escalated to me, and after looking into it, it just looks like someone moved the doc into another folder (probably accidentally). The user was trying to access the file from a URL link, and when it didn't work (because the file was moved), they panicked and assumed IT had done something. When I told the user that the file was most likely moved, their response is still implying that IT had something to do with it, as no one in their team (over 10 people, all with edit access to the file) would have moved the file. I reiterated that it was probably an accident by someone in the team, and a fairly common and easily addressable mistake, but the user has now involved their manager, to make sure the problem doesn't happen again. It's now become a way bigger issue than it ever needed to be, all because someone just accidentally moved an important file, and the user just can't accept that this happened and it wasn't someone IT behind it.
 This is just a recent scenario. Issues like these seem to happen all the time, where frustrated users just don't believe what you're telling them and seem to just blame anything on either IT staff or systems that they don't understand, yet speak with authority on.
 Any advice?

 I'm designing an EVPN-BGP network. I have never gone into etails wrt BGP.I read Krattiger's book about EVPN-BGP a Nexus 9000's perspective and there he always mentions that two fashions of eBGP might be used:
  
one AS for the spines, one for all the leaves; here the ption of accepting prefixes from own's AS must be cnfigured, otherwise all the announcements will be discarded
 one AS for the spines and one AS for each VTEP; here I only see a bit of complexity in configuring each VTEP because I cannot apply the same settings.
  
eBGP was proposed because, I think, if a peer goes down, then all the family memebers announce by it will be witdrawn in the peer's BGP table.
 Then somebody proposed to use
 3) iBGP but with Route Reflectors, because when a VTEP goes down all the family members announced by it will be withdrawn by the BGP tables of of al lthe clients.
 What do you implement in your own EVPN-BGP design and why?Any preferences among the 3 options above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The idea is simple: We need dynamic allocation of an incoming request via https, which will use a domain, e.g subdomain1.domain.org, which needs to be mapped to internal IP X.X.X.X and Port Y. Then, subdomain2.domain.org needs to go on a different port and IP. 
 Nothing special so far.
 ​
 Dynamic meaning on the fly, without having to edit a config file. These mapping need to be editable by another program.
 ​
 The subdomains can be created at will and need to be routed to the correct instance of our program (where each instance runs on a different port).
 There is nothing special needed, just a simple domain -> IP:PORT mapping like HAProxy can do.
 However, HAProxy has its Runtime API, which seems to not be able to hold up to this task.
 ​
 Do I need to create a custom forwarding solution, or are there existing ones which i could use?
 I personally think that HAProxy is really made for this, but it does not feature a way for dyamic creation. Since adding needs to be done ASAP, these edits cannot be done by hand and have to happen automatically.
 ​
 Has anyone here experience regarding automatic proxying? It seems like NGINX has some kind of feature like this, but then i'd had to pay a few thousands bucks for their NGINX plus model.
 ​
 Please let me know if more clarification is needed.

 I'd like to hear what laptop you have and how it differs from what your users have, or if you have multiple tiers.
 The market really is Dell, HP and Lenovo. I'm not really interested in HP.
 They say IT should have what the users have. We're a bit tricky since we have a ton of tech employees and engineers.
 A lot of people are running docker on their laptops but do not need absolutely absurd power but this just means the low end is out.
 I think we can cross off anything extremely low end, but also 9 pound workstation devices.

We recently merged with several other “local” businesses and are looking to build out a core network between the sites. Our CIO has already indicated his desire that the core will be a DWDM fiber ring but has left the rest to me (with assistance from some of our consultants).
 I’m curious if anyone has any insights that they learned from doing something similar. Anything you wished you incorporated into the design? Any vendor preferences or experience? We are currently looking at Ciena and Adva for DWDM and Cisco and Extreme for Core Routing. And I’d like to have the same vendor supply both core routing and Data Center switches. Corporate Network itself will be Cisco for the foreseeable future.
 Size wise (for context) Site is Core Chassis, 24 IDFs (30 9400 chassis) and ~400 Access Switches. ~65-70000 endpoints according to ISE. The other three sites are about 1/3-1/2 that size

 I want to have an internal LAN, for internal equipment, which can also be accessible through WiFi. I also want to create a public LAN for guests, wireless as well as wired (from selected places). The private lan should not be reachable from the public lan, but the opposite is ok.
 We managed to lay our hands on a Cisco WLC plus 5 APs as well as two Cisco manageable switches, so I believe that the only thing missing here is a router (preferably Cisco). Can anyone please suggest a suitable model? It needs to be able to handle Gigabit Ethernet, otherwise I don’t believe it needs any fancy features 
 I have found a used Cisco ISR 4331 for about $250 which is within my budget. Would this be a good choice?
 Thanks.

 My question is: is it better try try to supernet and add large ranges of IP, and maybe misalign some ranges, or to add all of the smaller ranges and ensure we have the right sites associated with each subnet?
 There is a business case for the smaller subnets, but I'm not sure if it creates issues with lag on site lookup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the fourth job in 7 years I'm getting laid off due to mergers or outsourcing and it's getting tiring. I'm in my mid-30s, right here when age discrimination starts becoming a real thing, and just want a stable company for the next 15 years. 
 So the good news is the company is giving us 10 months severance plus 1 week's pay for every year and 6 months of insurance after we are let go.
 The bad news. When our director called us into the conference call to give the news he was very candid and probably told us more than he should have. Basically, it boils down to money, the business leaders found they can hire in Europe/UK for 60% of US wages. They can hire Indians for 20% of US wages. Australian wages were a wash with the US. They also decided it's cheaper to move the HQ to Ireland (with much lower corporate taxes) and import to the US. 
 I work with folks from Ireland and UK every day and their work is every bit as good as what we do in the states. I'm not bashing their skills but more concerned if we, Americans with insane salaries, have priced ourselves out of the global market. The state I live in has an average income of $61k. I make $153k. I make this kind of money with no degrees, a couple of entry-level certs, and to be honest very little effort on my part. I just kind of have been the guy people get along with and every few years some past co-worker DMs me if I'm interested in a new job. 
 Add in the sharp rise in remote work capabilities it's easier than ever for companies to look abroad for workers. Hell, even Canada and Mexico have much cheaper labor.

 So I have 15 Surface Go with Windows 10 with S mode. I need to make all of them have Windows 10 Home(via the free switch using Microsoft Store) with the same set of software. I figured the easiest way to do this is to clone a "master" Surface Go and clone them to the other 14 machines using Clonezilla.
 I am wondering if the master Surface Go's license key will get cloned to the other machines or if their key is already burnt into bios and I don't have to worry about them. Or do I have to find the keys for each machine and "re-key" them after cloning? 
 As of now, I don't have a budget to get VLs or Enterprise licensing but if that is the only way to do it properly I'll have to do some convincing to my bosses...

 I understand in place upgrade on DC is not recommended. Would it be ok to demote, in place upgrade, promote? (of course, health check, migrate FSMO etc).
 I guess the next best option is deploy new VM, demote the old server and change IP of new server, then promote. But i lose the name and for matters of convenience, i'd rather not. Could i safely use the first option?

It happened to totally randomly and I have no idea what it's talking about. Even if I knew the code that it wants, it won't allow me to type anything in the space provided. Underneath this is an option to change languages which I am able to click so the entire screen is not Frozen it's just it won't let me get the cursor going....
 Is there something I can do like a key I can press upon starting up to bypass this requirement? Please help there is so so much valuable information on this laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So its been about a year since I have been with this public community college. 
 One of the things they do here is when an employee retires they get to keep there email address. 
 I personally feel that that's not a good thing. I did some PowerShell here and there and basically did this. 
 1) Who are all the retired employees?
 2) When was the last time they have logged in to there exchange 2016 or Online. 
 Nearly all have not logged in within a year or more. 
 ​
 My concerns are that;
 1) They don't have MFA enabled. 
 2) They may contain sensitive information in those emails. So if the email becomes compromised that becomes accessible information. 
 3) If the account becomes compromised, they can use that email to communicate to other employees and make it easier to social engineer them. 
 4) A wasted license. 
 I am still new to my role and I may be paranoid for nothing, so from a more experienced individual what are your thoughts on this and if its best to get rid of this plan what are the reasons? 
 I have some directors that agree with me, but my VP of technology doesn't (Ironic I think). 
 ​
 But of course if a user isn't trying to log into there account would it really get compromised? I don't know, but I appreciate every input! Thanks.

 Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I'm trying to recreate it from scratch and I'm having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I've managed to set the 'admin' password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using 'cn=admin,cn=config', but that's about it. I can't change, create, or delete anything.
 I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don't remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can't even do that as the admin user itself is RO.
 What's even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I've been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can't write anything except its own password apparently.
 How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? 
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently onboarded a group of test engineers that are constantly running automated tests 24/7 (all conducted on their own VLAN network). Ever since they’ve joined everyone has started complaining about slow internet and we cannot upgrade our main ISP connection since we’re already on the highest (albeit slow in general) service tier. 
 Luckily a new ISP became available and we are about to sign up with them. 
 So I had a question about how to best configure my firewall appliance now that I’ll have two ISPs. 
 What are the pros/cons of these ideas:
  
Load balance WAN1 and WAN2. 
 
Get the testers on a dedicated switch that would connect to a dedicated interface port on the firewall and route that traffic to WAN2. 
 
 Which of these two would be the better option? If there are any better ideas let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. Just looking for some advice. I work in a public hospital system with 8500+ employees. Myself and one other person are responsible for Mobile Technology in all forms: Vocera, Encrypted Flash drives/Ironkey, iPads/iPhones and MDM (Intune), the corporate cellular account, and BYOD support. 
 We've basically been slammed since COVID happened. We work 50 hours a week, then get paged off hours because we didn't get to that one ticket that is now suddenly "patient impacting". Despite working without a lunch break, being in many meetings for projects (6-10hrs a week), and working my ticket queue when possible, we never catch up. For the past two years, we've never been under 100 requests, and we've been building two new sites that have many different mobile applications in which I'll somehow be supporting. As of current, my team of two support over 17k devices including 5k personal devices in BYOD. 
 I know nowhere is perfect, but I feel my boss is being arrogant when I ask him about hiring more people. His response is always "this is only a phase" or "we're fully staffed at what we have, we'll have to get caught up". But other internal IT depts are hiring like crazy. The apps team hired 5 in the last two years and the epic team brought in a whole company of 20 contractors to do their breakfix while they worked on our new sites. Just as examples
 I guess what I'm asking is is this situation everywhere? Am I dreaming that IT life doesn't have to be so understaffed and overworked? I'm salary and don't break 75k, and my coworker is at 55k. We get great healthcare, which is why I stay, but just wondering if you all think I should man up and realize I work in a stressful environment and IT is that way everywhere, or is there better out there somewhere? What's it like for you all in similar roles? Thanks for your thoughts!

 I’ve heard nothing from MS. I also suspect there is nothing sensitive I’ve given MS.
 I’m curious if anyone has been informed by MS that they were affected. 
 MS’ statement says, in part, “ Our investigation found no indication customer accounts or systems were compromised. We have directly notified the affected customers.”
 I’m also curious how they define “affected customers.”

 I am hoping that the collective minds here on Reddit can help me out. 
 I am the administrator of an air gapped network inside of our Enterprise-Wide Network 
 In order to access it the users must be on the EWN. 
 The network has its own domain which does not trust the EWN. 
 There is no smtp traffic allowed out. 
 The only way the end users can get it is to have an account on in my domain, as well as on the Enterprise domain. They can access 1 server over RDP.
 Now my problem is this, the accounts are set to expire every 30 days for security purposes. BUT there is no way the user can log in via RDP if their account is expired, to reset the account. 
 I am looking for a method for the users can manage their own accounts, so they don’t have to call me to reset their passwords. Are any of you in the same situation, and how do you resolve it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow IT professionals. I need your help and advise regarding PSU configuration issues in a Dell Poweredge r6515. It is running RHEL 8. I hope I can explain this clearly…
 We recently upgraded PSU’s in the server from 550w to 700w. According to the Dell website, the new PSU you install will take on the firmware of the previously installed PSU. So, in this case our 700w PSU is using the firmware of the 550w PSU. Obviously we just need to install the firmware for the 700w PSU’s. Here’s the catch, Dell doesn’t have any firmware for 700w PSU’s for this server available to download. There should be firmware available for download because you can buy the r6515 server from Dell with the 700w PSU’s installed. 
 When we boot up the server it enters the bios and gives a low power warning. 
 IDRAC says the input wattage is 666 and output wattage - rated: 700, actual: 550. 
 We have been talking back and forth with Dell tech support and their tier 1 support has no clue what’s going on. They sent technicians out this week to install a new power board but that didn’t do anything to help. The technicians got one of the Dell tier 2 support guys in the phone but he didn’t help much either. 
 Anyone have any ideas or have any experience with this situation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m looking for some career advice in regard to moving into a network automation role. I am a network engineer with just over 10 years of experience. I am the one on my team tasked with automating. However, automation isn’t my primary job. I have an associates degree and some Cisco certs (including DEVNETASC). I’ve created web apps, automated network configuration, and created scheduled scripts to automate repeatable tasks. I have seen job postings for “Network Development Engineer” roles at large companies like Amazon and was wondering if anyone here is in a similar role and can give me advice on what hiring managers are looking for. Do I need a computer science degree? I actually just started a journey to get a CS degree, but man is it time consuming(especially with a family), expensive, and a lot of math (four more math classes). Or would my time be better spent getting DEVNET Professional and maybe some cloud certs?

 But it was a story of one custom application, not some giant system. Can it scale? Would it still be useful for later use if it was a large document?
 Some people know what will be useful, but not always you will catch everything.

 Basically, something like a jason file that creates a desired server according to my specification quickly, without manually installing pieces, copy pasting configs, setting up user accounts, etc. I then simply keep track of this config file. 
 What software does that? Should I learn ansible?

 there is a leaver every 2 weeks( infra/apps/IT mgmt/business)
 average tenure is 3-6 mths 
 some cowboys ( 1-2 senior admins with medium to high skill / age in IT but only worked at the place for 12 mths maybe 24) who play guessing games and have to discover the env as they go ( no up to date /accurate documentation ) fix stuff which break without telling the rest exactly how and also don’t document or share their knowledge 
 stuff keeps breaking - cowboys on leave or not available leaving juniors or newbies 
 Majority of Apps team and senior mgmt is very new too and clueless and just trying to outsource to solve the issues
 lots of politics /pushback between teams ( especially apps/infra/security )and finger pointing 
 only good thing is deep/wide /complex tech stack and playground as admins have full access to a whole stack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the question I have relates to Cisco Jabber. The User (or Users) can make calls from Jabber going from Jabber on his laptop to External company numbers. However they are not able to contact Internal company numbers.
 Naturally someone said it sounds like a routing issue. (Most of the company has Jabber working this is a new group being stood up working from vpns)
 User(who is on a vpn) can ping all the way into the Datacenter to the call manager server, I can ping from the switch the server is connected to, to the User PC. I can ping both directions from the Data Center Backbone switch. Routing seems to work. 
 ​
 So here's my thoughts. If they are able to talk to external numbers then the traffic has to go all the way into the datacenter anyways and hit the server before going back out again. Also from what I saw in emails of previous troubleshooting the Jabber Client on the PC is saying connected as far as registering with the server goes.
 (also for your knowledge I'm mainly from networking side of the house, we have a separate dept for the phone stuff so typically don't get too much into phone issues most of the time.)
 ​
 Jabber Outgoing - > External Number - Works
 Jabber Incoming<- External Number - Works
 Jabber Outgoing -> Internal Number - Not Work
 Jabber Incoming -> Internal Number - Not Work
 ​
 Any thoughts of what more to look into or questions I should ask?

 However, I'm also having issues at boot with iDRAC. Very similar to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cw7esz/idrac_initialization_error_on_poweredge_t420/ where fans are blowing at max speeds, the light at the back of the machine is flashing orange with the following error message:
  
Warning! iDRAC initialization error. Continuing to boot may yield unexpected power loss due to unknown power inventory and various features lost such as Remote Access, Active Power Management, Thermal Management, Inventory, LCD, or System Error Reporting. 
  
I guess my question is, do I have two separate issues going on here? Or is the iDRAC issue related to the missing raid controller. Just wondering if I purchase a replacement RAID controller am I going to still be stuck with more problems. This is my first Dell Server and have no experience with how iDRAC works.

It's running as a DC, a file server, and there's an Access database that clients access through some program installed on the workstations. There're two client workstations that can't have the program installed and so have to access the database directly on the server. Their previous IT set up RDS but never installed licenses; they just kept renewing the trial. We've had to fix a lot of how the previous IT did things and we are trying to get licensing for the two workstations that need to RDP into the server to access the database. I believe you can have the RDS session host and the RDS licensing manager on the same box, but correct me if I'm wrong. Can I use 2022 Server CALs for this situation or do I have to use Server 2016 CALs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I'm looking for recommendations of and experiences with Linux antivirus options for on-premise company servers. We already use Symantec on our Windows servers and clients, and while it has a Linux version, it lags behind in supporting recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) and it doesn't play nice with containers. We have a bunch of Ubuntu servers at various locations running QEMU/KVM virtualization, Docker (in VM), Kubernetes (nodes in VMs) und LXD containers (on bare metal) backed by local ZFS storage.
 We're looking for an option that is capable of dealing with containers, so that we'd only need to install the AV on hosts and VMs, and that offers sensible licensing/pricing, ideally per physical server instead of full price per install or at least reduced price for a VM install. Centralized management would be nice but not a requirement, log and/or mail based alerts would suffice. Needless to say we require good detection rates, timely signature updates and the capability to prevent the execution of malware. The main threat scenarios are malware getting on the servers either via compromised clients, exposed vulnerable services (hello Atlassian) or supply chain compromise (hello npm).
 The state of AV websites is a sad affair, with a general lack of clear statements about capabilities and business licensing options and costs (its all "Contact us!"), thus I turn to you.

 Left Switch: Vlan 10 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 10 computer
 (Connecting both Switches I have a trunk port configured in both Switches) 
 Right Switch: Vlan 30 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Router configured with subinterfaces for each Vlan (10,20,30), when "show ip route" shows everything allright
 So my problem is that I have configured everything exactly the same for each Vlan to make Router-On-A-Stick possible and it works, for example I can ping Vlan 30 computer to Vlan 20 computer or the opposite case but no computer on any Vlan can ping Vlan 10 and Vlan 10 can't ping the other Vlans. So what could be the problem? I swear to God I configured every Vlan in the same way and I have deleted the lab and started again several times and happens the same issue. Thanks in advance

I understand perhaps there's something different with the formatting of different data such as files or videos but on a digital level they're just a bunch of ones and zeros so why bother making different types?
 ​
 Also, I've tried cutting an ethernet cable in half and I can't seem to find any additional circuitry. All I saw was just a bunch of wires together. So what makes this ethernet cable different from a USB cable? Is there a circuit inside that I didn't see that processes or sends data differently?
 ​
 Also read that HDMI is better designed for sending media such as video, but why so? why is it better than a USB? Does it have some additional circuitry? If yes, what does it do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently anxious about a counteroffer I made today. So the job offered me $25 an hr which is $52K. I had the interview this past Monday-nailed my interview including the interview with the V.P. However, I made it clear that I had other interviews that week and could not formally respond until Friday. Another job offered me $28 or $56,160 a year. I called back Job A, recruiter was kind and asked me how my other interviews went. I said great and thanked him for being patient, I said another job offered $28 and wanted to see if they could match it. I stressed that I really wanted to work with them. He asked if I’d take anything lower so I said $27. This is about a $4K difference than their original offer. Normally I wouldn’t negotiate but I feel I’m the perfect person for the role-they actually sought me out from a job site-hounded me for about two weeks for an interview. They ended up offering me the role hours after my interview. My question is, did I screw up? If they reject my counteroffer, can I go back to their original offer? I didn’t make the counteroffer as a non-negotiable, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. He said the latest I should be hearing back is early next week. I wouldn’t start this job until Nov 7, after my two weeks notice with my current company so the delayed acceptance is not an issue.

 I have determined that this is happening on multiple cable based business comcast networks all with static IPs.
 If anyone can check and report back also? If so, no idea how or to whom to report this?It's fine on a Verizon static FIOS network and on a Comcast fiber network, and on a home Comcast cable network just not on a static cable based business Comcast network...
 And i also tried changing DNS servers within nslookup with the same result... so something is blocking MX resolution for verizon.net but just on Comcast business cable connections!?!
 If anyone else is experiencing this as a workaround i setup a send connector scoped for that one domain using smarthost:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We use Symantec Email.Security Cloud. Yes, I know, Broadcom stuff. Don't ask about it.
 This week, Microsoft 365 just disabled Basic Auth from our tenant.
 So, if you are using Schemus (their sync tool) and syncing from Exchange Online (EXO), app passwords won't work anymore. 
 Worked with Broadcom's support. Surprinsingly, so far so good. 
 Support adviced to:
 - upgrade Schemus to latest downloadable version ( Schemus Synchronization Tool – Mandatory Upgrade (broadcom.com) ) and apply a support-supplied patch. This will enable Microsoft Graph as a source and enables usage of Exchange Online Cert-based auth.
 - Install Powershell 7.03+ plus EXO v3. If using Server 2012 R2 (like me...don't ask again) you need to create a config file so Schemus knows where to look for PoSh 7.
 - Configure an App Registration in Azure AD to allow to authenticate against EXO with a certificate (CBA, App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell | Microsoft Learn )
 - Reconfigure Schemus to use EXO CBA. 
 - And that's it...supposedly.
 Why supposedly? Well, seems like Schemus still uses EXO v1 "get-recipient" and that causes a timeout for us for just the "user" sync part (which is optional, but we use it). I managed to reproduce that error and compared against "get-EXOrecipient", which worked fine. Already told them that, so I guess we will have to wait for another patch from Broadcom's developer, Metanate (the one who develops Schemus).
 Hopefully this will help others who are stuck with Broadcom's stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some suggestions on what hardware to purchase for a firewall and switch. We are a small company and the budget is limited. We would prefer (though this is not essential) a single box and something that does not require subscriptions. One of the key requirements is that the stack has no single point of failure as we need to meet high uptime guarantees and so I am looking for something with a redundant power supply (I suppose 2 cheaper switches might be ok). We also need to be able to access the device management interfaces (iDRAC, IPMI) of devices on the internal network remotely and so need to have some facility to create a VPN (this seems preferable to a jump host). So, the requirements are: 1) Redundant power supply 2) Firewall 3) VPN 4) 10GbE minimum (SPF+ is preferred to RJ45) 5) <10 ports required
 Our main issue is that everything available that has redundant PSUs has 40+ ports and costs $$$. We only really need a single WAN port and 5 LAN ports (make that 10 to allow for expansion). Techbuyer have a useful product filter here: https://www.techbuyer.com/uk/catalog/category/view/s/network-switch-selector/id/482/ but all the results are switches with 40+ ports. Does anyone know of other product databases one can use or have any personal suggestions (including a different design utilising multiple boxes)? Any help much appreciated.

 The catch is, from my understanding Autopilot requires Azure Premium licenses, but we would only need that feature for the minority of users we have on Windows.

 So in the meantime, I'm looking for the simplest way to get a Mesh VPN network with the ASAs. Is this feasible? I can't find much on the topic. Or do I just wait and implement when we get new gear?

 I spoke with my manager and the other tech about all the things happening right now and they both told me in confidence they are already applying for another job. Also the people on our IT helpdesk are already fired.
 The fun fact is that I'm also busy finding another job and the three of us (manager, other tech and me) are the last sys admins for the company. So we are probably all going to leave the company in a couple of weeks without a replacement and I want to leave as much information behind for my successor(s).
 Besides of documentation, what can I do to make it as easy as possible for the people that will replace us?

Don't need to be outdoor rated per se, will be indoors, just not a climate controller indoors, so harsh temperature/humidity exposure.
  
L2 only is fine
 at least 5 10/100/1000 PoE or PoE+ ports
 at least 2 SFP+ (might be able to compromise with SFP)
 AC powered preferred (no need for dual/redundant power)
  
Looking at the usual suspects, Mikrotik CSS610-8G-2S+IN looks like it might be a price winner, but only lists ambient temperatures and not operating temperatures? None of the Mikrotik outdoor-rated switches seem to check all the boxes. Aruba's rugged CX 4100i seems perfect on paper, anyone have experience they can share with those?
 Would also be open to older generation, used/refurbished units if it means I don't have to wait for any huge supply chain backlogs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are working for multiple customers. Mostly we administrate some servers or databases for those (so we run Ansible, we connect to databases, replace certificates and such tasks). Every customer is sharing us a VPN – mostly personal accounts with 2FA, not a site-to-site or a general VPN account. This means that every new colleague is getting a new VPN account. Some VPNs require additional configurations (f.ex. setting routes/DNS manually), some not. And we have plenty of technologies: OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, FortiClient VPN, Cisco, …
 As some are using Linux, some Windows, some macOS – there are always troubles setting the VPN's up.
 We first started using OpenConnect, which supports a lot of different VPN services. But we had the problem that some configurations did not apply correctly and that some IDS systems detected this and it was forbidden by the IT.
 So: I'm looking for a way how my co-workers easily can connect to the different VPN's. I'm currently thinking of creating an RDS Server for each customer with everything preconfigured, authenticated by a certificate – or maybe something with Amazon WorkSpaces. But I think there must be a better solution to this.
 How do you handle this? Do you have an idea how we could gain some efficiency instead of a long on-boarding process and big documentations? It can be a technical solution, as we're mostly developers, system engineers or similar.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I oversee a few campus networks where each campus currently has 1 subnet/network for voice and data that spans multiple buildings.
 I'd like to create a VLAN (200) specifically for the phones but use a unique subnet per building. This will allow us to tell the phone system if network = 1.0.1.0/24 use e911 number 555-555-0001.
 Building A (with the firewall) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.1.0/24
 Building B (uplinks to Building A) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.2.0/24
 Building C (uplinks to either Building A or B) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.3.0/24 
 Currently all Buildings have a 'data' VLAN (1) using the subnet 1.0.0.0/24 
 IIRC, this can be done via VLAN Mapping or Translation? Not something i've every used. Unfortunately, our HPE OfficeConnect (1820/1920 mostly) switches don't seem to support this. (I hate these switches) 
 My first thought was to create a VLAN on the firewall per building with a DHCP scope/relay and somehow convert that VLAN to the same phone vlan on the switch. However, I realized this isn't easily doable - I could connect two untagged ports together to accomplish this but, ew. 
 My next thought would be to utilize the switches to handle VLAN 200 and set up a DHCP relay (our switches won't act as DHCP servers (nor do i think i want to manage that..) I believe all of our switches are Layer 3 lite - allowing for routing. This would work but i'd have to let the voice traffic traverse the data network and add in routes on the firewall to point to each network switch.. it sounds messy. 
 Is there a solution that I'm not seeing to accomplish this? (Besides buying new switches lol)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently our company has a weekly rotation of technicians who end up on call. Last night I had about 6 alerts come in from one location. It was about 1.5 hours of afterhours work and then it was resolved at about 11:00 PM.
 Later throughout the night, I had two more alerts come in around 1:45 and 3:00 AM that were short term disruptions that resolved themselves. In addition, I had two clients call in at 3:00 AM and then 5:00 AM about their VPN connection not operating. I missed these two calls, and my manager is furious with me because "that is what is expected of the on-call person."
 Is it reasonable to expect someone who receives alerts like this, respond to them throughout the night and be expected to start work at 8:00AM the next day and work a full 8-hour shift? Yes, we do get additional compensation for the week of being on call, but my thinking is that setting these expectations is what results in mistakes being made and on the job injuries. I'm not saying that you shouldn't work the next day but expecting someone to be up and running first thing and being sleep deprived is not a healthy thing.
 Am I wrong for thinking about it this way? What are your thoughts on this or what expectations does your company set?

My ceilings are going to be 10ft for the most part, so I don't think building something with static height will work very well.

 Basically C-Suite says: I want all the computers to be unlocked and working before I get near them
 But my experience says: 2FA everything, lock every screen after 10-20 minutes of no activity, detect and disconnect mouse jigglers if needed, and always use unique accounts even at public kiosks
 This company is constantly under attack from phishing/spoofing and can't afford to pay for better M365 tiers to mitigate it. One of the IT Directors used the password Passwerd2020 a couple years ago, and the pen tester was able to use that account to find and access a full AD backup (don't have more detail on this, but it was bad).
 Seems they should be freaking out about how bad their security is, instead the execs are just trying to poke more convenience holes. Is there a psychological trick or some kind of magic words that get this through? Can I just say it's synergetic and get them to turn around? I'm not great at dealing with people who don't accept the truth and want to see IT as an obstruction.
 It's like having people say "It's really inconvenient, remove the deadbolts on my doors. The handle has a lock, why do I need two?" over and over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to run a script to check complaince with switches. I got it working for the most part, but ran into a roadblock.
 My task I am trying to do now is to check is a specific ACL exists, and then to also verify it is placed on one of the vty lines. Normally, I would start by doing something like this....
 Output = net_connect.send_command ('show ip access-list') if "ACL NAME" in Output: print ('Compliant') else: print ('Not Compliant') 
 That works, but I also want to verify that it is place in the right location. So I could do another function like above to run a "show run | sec line vty" and verify that "ACL NAME" is in the Output. But that would be 2 different functions and 2 different print statements.
 Is there a way I can run both of those checks and have one print statement if they are both compliant?
 I was thinking I could do something like this....
 def check_acl(Output) if "ACL NAME" in Output: return True return False Output = net_connect.send_command ('show ip access-list') if check_acl(Output): print ('Compliant') else: print ('Not Compliant') 
 I was thinking I could do 2 def statements then have the function check for both def statements, but I am getting lost with that.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks

 Until I presented him with the laptop usage agreement. See, about a year ago, shortly after we added this client, we helped them draft Device Usage Agreements for users. 
 Pretty basic stuff. Date, Serial Number, condition issued, agreement for work purposes, cannot install/uninstall software, etc.
 Dude loses his absolute mind. Refuses to sign. Starts talking about how "No one is going to tell him what he can or can't do with his laptop!"
 Anyway, owner was walking by during the rant. Guy no longer has a job or a laptop. Owner is convinced they dodged a bullet.

 I am trying to start a new project where I need some devices which will be configured with OSPF and stacking or MLAG. So far I had setups with Cisco 6500 (no stacking here but dual supervisors), 2x Brocade ICX 6610 in stacking, 2x Dell 6224 in stacking. What I can say is that cisco and brocade were both extremely stable while dell had CPU usage issues along side other minor issues. Obviously all options I used so far are very old and I would like to try something new which consume less power.
 I was looking at Arista DCS-7050TX or Dell S4048-ON (I know there is a risk of Clock Signal failure, or was there?). Any suggestions or maybe different options? And yes I am sure these options are a bit older too but for this personal project I would go with something refurbished. Thank you :)

 We are looking into using this for a different org (about 40 users), and found that it's a bit cheaper through a 3rd-party. But I'm wondering if we will not have the same "admin center" abilities as the one I purchased through Microsoft.

 i now got a job in a tech startup (30+ employees 70 R&D) I have never worked in a start up before and most of my experience has been from larger organizations or enterprises. 
 Before i joined the company all systems administration has been done by DevOps and the CISO, so most if not all systems have never been setup properly, lots of software or other systems are still running trial versions that in some cases are expired with limited functionality. every day is a new challenge to just maintain a proper production. 
 I am hired as the IT systems administrator, so everything with IT, user management, Governance, risk and compliance falls under my scope. 
 With this whole mess that i am trying to balance I am slowly starting to lose my mind, and my motivation is long gone. 
 How do you keep the motivation up?
 it has been so bad for me that i have even considered if i should start working in a completely different line of work (oh yeah, I applied for a job in the local Lidl because the benefits are better then what i get now) 
 I actually don't expect any replies, just needed to get this off my chest

When I looked at their device it shows that it is enabled and the config profile assigned is the same as the one on my test device.
 What is weird is that my device shows as disabled, we have the exact same config profile assigned and all I can see is that the developer options settings is allowed from the list of settings.
 Anyone know where this setting sits or is named under in android config profile settings.

 We can reproduce the issue regularly by going onto a network that doesn't have permission to the print serve, open word, and edit margins. Word then locks up while searching for the printer (which it can't find the default printer because they are not on the VPN or Network with permission to the printer). Eventually times out and seems to remember the time out for that session of word. It does cause other delays also
 Others are saying they get around it by setting a default printer to the local PDF writer but that isn't really the best option. 
 It seems office is trying to connect to get the page setup information from the printer. Is there a setting somewhere to change this behavior. We are kind of stumped at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saw the post about the HR person who had to feel what we go through all the time. It really got me thinking about all the abuse I've had to deal with over the past 20-odd years. Fellow employees yelling over the phone about tickets that aren't even in your queue. Long nights migrating servers or rewiring entire buildings, come in after zero sleep for "one tiny thing" and still get chewed out by the Executive's assistant about it. Ask someone to follow a process and make a ticket before grabbing me in a hallway and you'd think I killed their cat.
 Our pay scales are out of wack, every company is just looking to undercut IT salaries because we "make too much". So no one talks about it except on Glassdoor because we don't want to find out the guy who barely does anything makes 10x my salary.
 Our responsibilities are usually not clearly defined, training is on our own time, unpaid overtime is 'normal', and we have to take abuse from many sides. "Other duties as needed" doesn't mean I know how to fix the HVAC.
 Would a Worker's Union be beneficial to SysAdmins/DevOps/IT/IS? Why or why not?
 I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. I guess I kind of wanted to vent. Have an awesome Read-Only Friday everyone.

 Before I tell the user again that IE11 is (currently) PART OF Win10, and trying to install IE3.0 or IE 3.0 libraries for active X doesn't make any sense - I'm doing a sanity check. How likely is this to break the Win 10 install if it'll even install at all?

 I’m posting here because i’m a bit lost and I don’t know what to do with my career. I’m a network engineer currently working in the banking industry. Currently I work a lot on campus networking and especially Wifi (Cisco and Aruba) and NAC stuff (mostly ISE), but I’m one of the few in the team which is able to work on almost every perimeter (LAN, WIFI, Automation, Routing, Security).
 Right now I don’t really know what would be best for my career, I could dig more in WIFI for exemple and become a specialist in one of those field or keep being a « jack of all trade master of none ». But i’m always afraid by choosing to become a specialist on a field, WiFi, i’m closing myself some doors and be less futur proof in my career.
 So I’m interested from your experience what do you think would be best to do ?
 Thanks a lot

 If I replace it with a short cable it works fine, so it is definitely the cable.
 Not sure if it's a dodgy cable or if I am getting lots of electromagnetic interference.
 Should I buy a shielded cable? or perhaps a cat 7. or is there some way to make linux run on a more unstable connecton since windows seems fine with it.

But people still reported issues which I isolated to Google Calendar invites. So I set up DKIM for Gmail and go the DNS provider to add that TX record. 
 After enabling authentication, I'm finding the "Sending email" dialog in Thunderbird on my laptop sat there for ages before sending. Sending email from the GMail web UI didn't do this. Now, some ten minutes or so later, I tried again from Thunderbird and there was a flicker of a pause, but nothing like before. So I'm hoping the initial long delays were just because the DNS changes were propagating. Can I hope this is the case? Can anyone verify that just after enabling DKIM, a pause sending emails is expected and is due to DNS which will ease over the next 24-48 hours?

 I've done a netsh winsock reset and a reboot, which I thought fixed it (I could resolve a hostname that wasn't previously working) but just seems to have made it a little better, not fixed it altogether. I've removed the virtual NIC and put a new one in. I've switched temporarily to DHCP. The issue persists. It's using the two domain controllers as DNS servers, the same as every other server in that domain, and they're all fine.
 "Test-Netconnection DC1 -p 53" connects successfully (as does DC2).
 If I do an nslookup for anything, it finds it. But if I immediately ping it, chances are, it won't resolve the name.
 Name resolution fails regardless of whether I just search for the NETBIOS name or the FQDN. I've tried putting a random dot at the end of both as per some ancient article I found on Google, but that doesn't work either.
 This server has just gone live to the whole business, so I really don't want to rebuild it if I can avoid it, but I'll try most non-destructive things out of hours. I've got good backups of it but I don't really know when this started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 I'm looking for ways to centrally manage access to customer, and internal servers. Servers are 95% accessed by RDP, if not, TeamViewer.
 Some customers we've got shared admin credentials to, others we've got personal credentials on, and we'll need to be able to use both - with personal ones only known to the individual user.
 Today we're using Royal TS and managing document (RDP/gateway/credential folder) access with Azure Security Groups -> AADDS Security Groups.
 We're a Windows house, fully onboard with Azure, with all that it entails.
 ​
 Need to have:
  
Centrally managed access controle. This can happen any which way, fx via Security Groups.
 
Logging. Access log is a must have.
 
Automated emergency access.
 
Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory Domain Services integration.
 
Windows and Mac support.
 
Helpful vendor support.
 
Session recording.
 
GDPR compliant. 
 
Admin and user rights.
 
 ​
 Nice to have:
  
PIM/PAM support.
 
Password management from the same vendor - for passwords not related to the servers.
 
PowerShell manageable if applicable (it's nice not to have to go through every single setup point, for hundreds of customers).
 
Auditing for GDPR (if applicable).
 
 ​
 If PAM is included, I'm looking for cheaper alternatives than Delinia/Thycotic and Cyberark. (Though if a good price can be provided, they're in the loop)

 A really strange but replicable issue has arised.
 When a user forwards an email in the ios outlook app that contains pictures (such as a logo in the signature or inline images) ALL images in the email (including previous mails in the same email) become one of the images. 
 This only happens if you select "Expand previous mesasge" (rough translation, sorry) during the forward. You can see that all images gets turned inte one of the images in the "edit-mode" but that is not necessarily the same one that gets sent.
 We have the lates ios outlook and ios 16.03
 Have you seen anything like this?
 To try it yourself: 
  
Open an email with pictures 
 
Select Forward
 
Click "Expand Message" / "Show full message"
 
All the images gets turned into one of the pictures
 
 Optional:
  
Send the email
 
All the images could turn into one of the other images in the mail

 I'm looking to get a new UPS for our office as the current one is essentially a very heavy paper weight. 
 I'm not looking to spend loads and really only need enough backup time to shut everything down safely (5-10 minutes max).
 The equipment I have is below:
 Watchguard M270: 75W
 US-48-500W: 500W x 2
 UAP-AC-Pro: 9W x 3
 Poweredge R320: 350W x 2
 HP Microserver: 200W 
 Total: 2002W 
 Preferably I'd like it under £1000 but could stretch to perhaps £1250-1500 if really required.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Never ran across this before in 15 years... 
 Existing gear in IDF1 was a Cisco 2960x with 1gig link back to MDF (Meraki ms425).
 Upgraded IDF1 to Meraki ms225 and new 10gig MMF SFP last night. Had issues trying to get the fiber link up. Tried rolling fiber at IDF. Tried rolling fiber at MDF. Tried different patch cable at IDF side. Now what worked was rolling at BOTH sides. Once that link came up (and at 10gig), I was like - that doesn't make sense so we tested and rolled them both back and tried all other combinations, fail.
 Fast forward to tonight. Same site, different IDF, same MDF switch. Link wouldn't come up after new gear was in. I said let's roll both sides at the same time. Link came up. What the hell?
 The only thing I can think of is - at the MDF side, fiber patch cables are orange, but there's about a foot of distance leading starting at its LC connector where ONE of the strands turns yellow. Where it transitions orange, there's about 2 inches of some sort of shrink wrap and the cable gets slightly bulkier there. The other strand is orange the whole way. It looks factory made. I haven't been able to find an image of those online. 
 Who know what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow Sysadmins,
 I've been working at an old fashioned (small and rather niche) MSP for the last 10 years and will soon make the move to a well-known and bigger company. With a good bump to my salary. As smaller MSPs are, I've got a rather broad spectrum of skills but I am no master in a lot of those. Well, that may be knocking myself a bit down, but you get the gist.
 My new employer put me into a department that will also be focused on providing managed services with some focus on cloudy stuff as well as even providing private cloud instances to customers. I am destined to be a network-guy (but it could change to something else if it fits, I am pretty open to other positions), which fits the focus of my previous position, but with a lot of focus to newer technologies like software defined networking / SD-WAN and the like which I have pretty much no clue about. (Well, I setup a vxlan peering on my proxmox-homelab-cluster and connected three VMs with it, but that's about it :-D)
 I guess I made a good impression and I was pretty honest about this lack of knowledge on my part, so there will probably be provided training at the start and I will not be expected to have this knowledge. I think I showed enough willingness to learn new stuff and general interest in IT to be a future asset to my employer.
 Be that as it may, tldr, I'd love to read up and learn about the newer network-concepts like SDN/SD-WAN and stuff in this direction but I am not sure where to start exactly. Can someone point me in the right direction? Or maybe recommend some good papers/videos about this stuff? I'd like not to focus on a specific manufacturer, but if they provide good content I don't mind.
 Thank you very, very much!

 Problem 8(using link): I know that the window size is how many frames it can transfer at a time. 
 In this scenario, the first 3 frames are sent, and B would have to send an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec and therefore, 30 msec after the frame transmission begins. 
 How I interpret it:
  
Frame 1 takes 10 msec to arrive from A to B
 I don't understand "The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec, and therefore, 30 msec" Are we still talking about frame 1? 
  
​
 This is the diagram i've written to help me understand it:
  
I have 10 frames(10 boxes)
 A sender with vert line, and B is receiver with vert line: frames 1,2,3 are sent.
 Frame 1 takes 10 msec to transmit from A to B
 Frame 2 takes 10 msec after frame A is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 Frame 3 takes 10 msec after frame B is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 3 frames fill up the window, so receiver has to send out an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. Window slides, and A is able to send another frame to B, then B sends acknowledgement again and it repeats. 
  
The bullet point I bolded is what I am struggling with. My teacher has tried explaining this to me, but I'm not grasping that way of interpreting it.

 Our current plan is to stick the SFP into the switch for the clients (Most clients only have 1-2 switches, generally a Cisco of some sort, 24-48 ports with 2-4 SFP ports.) and then setting one single SFP and one single RJ45 port into their own VLAN and using that to bridge the SFP Modem with WAN interface on the router. However, for the router to connect to the ISP over this SFP modem, it requires tagging a VLAN on the WAN interface.
 If we were to set the SFP and RJ45 ports to access ports to some random VLAN - e.g. 2000, and then set the router to tag VLAN2 on the WAN port, would the switch see the VLAN2 tag on these access ports and then just strip the VLAN tag?
 One of our other options is just a SFP to RJ45 media converter, but then that requires extra plugs, and an extra point if failure, not to mention more cost rather than just plugging the SFP into a switch and partitioning the switch out, not as costly as a router but a cost that the client would need to bear.
 Alternatively, we could just upgrade all of our clients to routers with SFP ports, but then we're going to need to convince the clients to put the money in to upgrade their routers in the cases where they don't already have routers with SFP ports.
 Any opinions on the best way forward while still being cost efficient?
 Thanks all!

 We have a MS CA but we also have the ability to grab a third party cert. There are about 10 people that will need to be able to sign. We use yubikeys so we have the ability to leverage them. 
 Anyone else do this in a small dev team with no code being sent externally? To be honest I've never dabbled with code signing before and most info is for Dev firms and large companies needing a lot of people to do it..

Currently, it's a flat network 192.168.1.1 /24 with our 48 port switch on eth1 port of ubiquiti edgerouter 4. The switch has multiple desktops(~10) and printers connecting to some win servers (setup as a terminal server). The voip phones would be added at each station sitting in front of the respective desktop on the same line. In order to power the phones, a second poe switch will be added as well.
  
 1) Firstly, should I be plugging one switch into another daisy chain style so the phones can see the SBC controller I've setup on the win server? In doing so, all uplink data will be running through a single shared 1GB line which is not great but it's only 10 u…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I maintain a small coaxial cable TV plant for a campus with a few dormitory buildings (about 400 rooms total). It's really simple with the CATV headend (digital QAM modulator) and we pipe in our licensed channels to it in addition to a few in house channels for signage and information. We're making a new dormitory that will be all ethernet and no coax to the room to use simple digital CATV enabled TVs. 
 It appears the hospitality IPTV market is large from fancy ones that have splash pages that welcome you with customized information to your room. I do notice that at the hotels a lot of them have set top boxes behind the hospitality TV and this seems complex. I feel like buying hospitality grade smart TVs will lock us in or perhaps the set top box is the way to go? How much do these systems cost to maintain and license? is it even worth it?
 I really like the simplicity of coax CATV, just scan for new channels (the channel plan rarely changes) and go, so I can just push to get coax installed in the new dorm to each room and extend CATV to the dorm with HFC fiber. Change my mind?
 One possible driving factor for IPTV is to also allow users to watch IPTV on their desktop or mobile devices. I can technically hit the multicast IP on the distribution side (source to QAM modulator) and watch it in VLC but it's not too user friendly. I don't know how many users would actually watch our channels on mobile. I have tested Haivison's HMP product and have always wondered if there are competition products to this. Is there anything open source in this space at all?

I am looking for thoughts on how to improve this process so I can stop spending my days playing Whac-A-Mole with VLAN changes. I have started adventuring down the idea of possibly creating a Ansible or Python script that would search the network, find the port and configure the list of MAC’s for that VLAN.

It is giving esoteric errors that the MSP says DATTO says are due to a corrupted disk. The whole ordeal has been dragging out over weeks and I'm basically 
 "can i replace the disk?" no answer to that question.... 
 "can they check the disk" "ok we'll ask them....". Two days later I finally get a response that the disk is fine... but something is wrong with the (out of warranty) device. They want me to sign a new 3 year agreement and they'll give me a free box (I'm on the cusp of not wanting to work with this MSP anymore so a commitment is not high on my list!). But they also increase the rate by about 30% - which seems extravagant. I hate not being backed up and I'm pretty angry at myself for not getting VEAMM community up and running as part of my 2 onsite backup system. 
 I haven't had offsite replication in over two weeks. I'm unsure if my onsite/on-device backups are good or not. My SQL server backups are backing up to the attached NAS share without error, so... i guess those are ok... but they're not offsite. After weeks of no backup I'm ready to sign fucking anything, but such a strong increase sounds like a ball twist. 
 Is DATTO, now owned by kaseya (mind you, DATTO saved me from ransomware that a Kaseya server distributed so... fuck Kaseya and I'm extremely sad that they purchased DATTO), jacking up prices? Or is my MSP taking me for a ride? A $2000increase on top of an already expensive service is pretty fucking harsh, in my opinion.

 I'm searching for aggregation switch for UniFi Pro access switches but the thing is that it must not be neither UniFi nor Cisco. I really don't want to answer why so don't ask please.
 I would like that switch to aggregate UniFi over 10G SFP+ link each. Switch should be at least 12 ports, better 24. Can have any additional over for ex. 40G but I don't care about it much.
 If I could use Ubiquiti I would choose USW-Pro-Aggregation.
 If I could use Cisco I would choose Nexus 3064.
 I'm looking for something around these. Was given a tip for Huawei but I'm not sure. I personally worked with Juniper and HP (before aruba lines) and I don't see a problem with either.
 Not really fond of MikroTik but I'm not even sure if they offer anything around what I'm looking for.
 Any other ideas? Switch can be used, it doesn't need to be brand new (so I allow older EoLed models).
 Would be great if anyone could post models that I can look for and which definitely not even consider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client who has a PtP setup with Unifi NanoBeam 5AC's between their home and an event area about 900 feet away, distanced is reported by the Unifi device. At the home I get about 700 Mbps on wired LAN with speed test at fast.com. When I plug my computer in to the end of the PtP link at the event area, I get about 190 Mbps down and 180 Mbps up after the speed test. Event area is at the other end of a farm area so as far as I know, no electrical/wireless interference in the path.
 The speeds are more than enough for what is needed at the event area but the client wants to expand internet to a barn that has line of sight with the event area, it is about 1400 feet away (distanced is reported by the Unifi device). The barn will then have a PtMP that aims to 3 homes. I would include an aerial view but I can't share images here.
 My concerns are as follows:
  
How can I increase bandwidth between home and event area so that the barn and 3 homes can also benefit from the Internet circuit? What stats do I need to review and settings to tweak to try to increase bandwidth to near theoretical max throughput?
 If the home reaches consistently 700 Mbps, what is the max I should expect after the first PtP hop?
  
Do you have any specific resources I can read or watch to have a better understanding on how to optimize the wireless links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we've been dealing with some issues regarding Spectrum speeds/reliability for awhile now. We're being charged $400 a month for the 50x50 line itself (In the city), along with additional costs for things like a managed firewall. We've had stability issues quite frequently in the past with this line, but the stability seems to be better now. 
 50mb/s is not meeting our needs though. I understand the high cost is to guarantee these minimum speeds, though our speeds don't seem to really ever go above that. A shared line could give us 20 times the speeds for a quarter of the price. I would think that the 50mb/s is a minimum amount of bandwidth we'd get, shouldn't we still be able to get higher speeds despite them not being guaranteed? Or are we being capped at that 50mb mark? It seems like that 50mb/s minimum is our maximum, which seems a bit absurd. I'm not really sure if we're being throttled at that bandwidth. 
 If spectrum doesn't throttle dedicated lines at their guaranteed speeds, I suppose another cause may be the managed firewall that we have with them. It seems to be an older model, and from my knowledge it is performing tasks like Deep Packet Inspection. 
 We also use a shared building, with 2 other tenants in it. By paying for a dedicated line, would the other tenants in the building be using that line? From the agreement we signed, it looks like there are 3 address entries with the same address, so it seems plausible that we may not be getting that dedicated access, and that this may be a cost we should talk to the landlord about. 
 These are the theories I've come up with so far. I understand the value/cost associated with getting dedicated speeds, but it seems like we're pretty much being limited at these speeds. Any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client whose Windows Server 2003 device's motherboard died. He wants to get the system running on another computer again as the system contains software that powers some important industrial machines.
 I know that with Windows 10 and later you can just plug in a hard drive into any computer and it will re-adjust to new hardware and boot but with older Windows operating systems it will just blue screen because you will have to sysprep it first to be able to move it to another machine. But I can't boot this device anymore to sysprep it.
 What are my options to revive this operating system into another machine?
 Thanks in advance.

 Traffic for these VLANS can interact and all. For the sake of this post, this traffic all occurs on 192.168.5.0 / 255.255.255.0

 VLAN 2
 VLAN 3 and so on.
 
 Traffic for the special VLAN can interact and all. For the sake of this post, this traffic all occurs on 13.10.5.0 / 255.255.0.0. Any traffic in this network ID should be able to communicate only on this VLAN and outside (e.g. 192.168.5.0 cannot access this traffic).
  
VLAN 20 (Limited Traffic hidden from other VLAN's)
 
 As it stands now I can hit the 13.10.5.0 traffic from 192.168.5.0 .

 seems to have fixed issues related to office apps / teams / network dropouts
 been battling these issues for months, and only in the last 24 hours I've tried uninstalling this app and it seems to have helped a lot of my users.
 fingers crossed this is the permanent fix.
 ​
 EDIT: lots of people saying "image/MDT ur endpoints"... These laptops are sent straight from vendor and are pushed via azure autopilot/Intune. This isn't uncommon for larger enterprises. Manufacturer's drivers still end up on these machines even though they are specced for our org,, this scenario is just different to what you'd see if you have the opportunity to get hands on with every single laptop you order.
 EDIT #2: removed some snarkiness from my initial edit. It was a long day, sorry 🙂
 EDIT #3: if this is helping you, u/SpongederpSquarefab pointed out that "Annoyling Dell Command installs Dell Optimizer lol". Important to note.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 I am having an issue with my HP ProCurve 2510s, they are randomly shutting down the interfaces which go back to my router and the event log states that a loop was detected and the port was shut down, but im not sure where the loop actually is.
 This is my config:
 Checkpoint 1450 Appliance (Router & FW)
 Multiple Port-Based VLANS, EG 10.0.70.0/24, 10.1.70.0/24 etc you get the idea. These are not tagged vlans. 
 Switch 1 (one dropping ports)
 The switch is configured to have untagged uplinks back to the checkpoint appliance. These links randomly drop for network loops being detected, but there is no logs on the checkpoint to suggest a network loop was detected either. The uplink to my other switch (100mbps half duplex) does not drop, but these are tagged vlans. No ports on the other 2510 drop either
 Each Port-Based vlan has its own IP (EG 10.0.70.1, 10.0.70.2 etc)
 im genuinely unsure where to look next in finding this network loop
 any help will be appreciated, i can share configs if required

 What happens with smartphones and tablets that promiscuously share wifi PSK-personal keys? Do they also attempt to share IPSK? 
 I see the Cisco implementation can tie it to a MAC address but these are also easily copied, so it seems like IPSK still has the potential to be widely shared and used by unauthorized devices.
 Probably a more important question is if there is some way for a wifi network to tell the clients, do not share our PSKs with other devices.

 I managed Sonicwall firewalls at my old job and honestly loved them. The Cisco Firepower’s that replaced them I did not care for haha. 
 My question for anyone with experience with both Sonicwall and PaloAlto - is there any reason to look at the SMB line from Palo Alto over Sonicwall? Advantages, ease of management, new/better features? From my experience the sonicwall were easy to manage and rarely had issues. 
 Thanks!

 Basic auth is gone for Exchange online, which isn't an issue for Windows or Mac users, but for our wonderful Linux userbase this is getting quite problematic it seems. 
 Microsoft is saying use an OAuth app to authenticate via IMAP/POP/SMTP.
 I am not new to OAuth app integrations, but this is a bit out of my league, and I have quite some concerns: 
  
It is saying to give "application" level access for IMAP and POP - not delegated
 It is saying to give the service principal for that specific application access to a specific Mailbox
  
Now this combination makes me think that I need to create a unique App integration for each linux user and assign this unique service principal to the users mailbox? 
 I cannot create one App integration with one secret, which I give to every linux user, and then assign the service principal to each of their mailboxes, each linux user can access every linux users mailbox?
 I don't really see an easy solution for this mess, how are you doing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have two edge SRX1500 firewalls, that I am replacing old cisco routers and firewalls with. My problem is just figuring out the failover situation during an ISP failover without using an edge switch or routers.
 Basically ISP1 would connect to the active SRX and ISP2 would connect to the passive SRX. My goal is to have it failover to the Passive SRX and ISP2, if ISP1 is down (i.e bgp down, link down etc...). I am thinking IP monitoring would be best for this situation. But I wanted to see if someone here has done something like this that maybe has a better way of doing it or if I am missing something?
 ​
 Other questions:
  
With an active/passive cluster, anything connected to the passive SRX never passes traffic, so presumably the BGP session with ISP2 would never come up until a failover occurs, correct? 
 With IP monitoring, if I wanted to fail back to ISP1 I presume that has to be done manually?

 My issue is that I have a NAT map table setup but my IP routes are not following said map. Instead of the internal IP using the statically mapped external IP, it is using the "dynamic NAT". There is no way to disable Dynamic NAT and it's not even a range of IPs it a singular "dynamic NAT" IP. I believe this is the cause of said dynamic NAT IP being block listed since I am trying to send out newsletters. How can I get my IP routes to follow my NAT map properly?
 I've been one the phone with my ISP and they've told me they cannot disable this dynamic NAT and that they really don't even have anymore control than I do.

 However, I have a user reporting they cannot delete any quarantined messages, even old ones, from the quarantine page. I don't recall configuring a setting for this behavior, is this the global default? How long do they stay until being auto-deleted?

They're getting signed up to hundreds of different websites, lots of different languages, mostly european, some asian, lots of dutch, german and polish, and we're getting all the account creation emails. Obviously they're on a list somewhere that got sold, but wondered if there some sort of new wordpress form or other vulnerability that's being exploited. Whatever bot it is, seems to hit a website multiple times; whatever it's filling out in the forms for a name is random characters as some of those forms copy back that data to the email.
 Blocking some of it with geoip policies, some with language polices, but it's hardly making a dent. We're using barracuda. I can't find any commonality in the headers other than some have references to a php mailer in the xheaders, but that's not nearly enough to fingerprint on to block.
 Told the user that if it doesn't settle down in a couple of days, we may have to dump his current email to a group and get him a new address.
 Anyone seeing similar or know the source? Better yet, have some sort of magic regex that catches all of it?

 I would like to build a preproduction environment completely isolated from my production env.
 I'm looking at the best way to do it.
 Of course I would like to build something that is fully replicated from my prod. 
 Right now my production Vms are hosted in a vcenter.
 My company does alreay have a lab vcenter and we would like to clone the prod Vms into this lab vcenter.
 We don't have the entreprise license of vmware, so the crossed vcenter functionnality is not available. 
 My question is more about how am I supposed to replicate the production ? 
 I can use cron with rsync or ansible to transfer files from the prod to the lab but I'm wondering if there isn't a better solution ? 
 Do you guys have any feedback on how to build a pre production environment, fully replicated with the production servers ? 
 Thanks in advance.

Google meet obviously for the google meetings, Apple TV for mirroring the iPads when nobody is joining remotely, and the PC for all other meeting solutions that don't work with Google Meet. Since it's budget time we're looking for an all-in-one solution for joining meetings and the Smart board 6000s Pro seems like a pretty legit solution but I just don't know anybody who's actually used it. According to the product page it can join all of the major video conferencing platforms, and supports AirPlay mirroring, so it would wipe out all of the extra we have and users wouldn't have to change much. Does it have a lot of hardware compatibility in terms of webcams? Is it easy for users to use? Does it give a good experience when using it on all of the different meeting platforms? Anything I'm not thinking of?

 Is there an API I can use to update the teams room's calendar with events from an external source to keep them "in sync" with each other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've created this PS script to check on something in Citrix, but I don't know how to get it to email via our internal SMTP server, I'm tried a few examples via Google.
 The PS is:
 $obj = Get-BrokerDesktopGroup | Where-Object PublishedName -eq GSelector_W10 | Select-Object TotalDesktops, DesktopsAvailable, DesktopsInUse, Sessions, DesktopsUnregistered, DesktopsDisconnected, DesktopsFaulted, DesktopsPreparing If (($obj.DesktopsAvailable -eq 0) -or ($obj.TotalDesktops -eq 0)) { Send-MailMessage -From citrix-alert@domain.com -to me@domain.com -subject "Test Email" -body "Test message" -smtpserver smtpinternal.domain.com -port 25 } 
 Nothing arrives.
 However I was also trying to add the other values from the PS script so the body of the email message is something like:
  TotalDesktops = DesktopsAvailable = DesktopsInUse = Sessions = DesktopsUnregistered = DesktopsDisconnected = DesktopsFaulted = DesktopsPreparing = 
 Is this possible? I'm getting a little lost.
 Thanks

 This is a two part question. First part neccessary, in second topic I am not so sure about.
 Has anybody scripted to check for new updates, when found, do download and export to share? Later Dell servers iDRAC-s will check the share and upgrade its firmwares (BIOS, iDRAC) without reboot. 
 Once a month or so when operating systems get updates, servers will be rebooted automatically and upgraded firmwares will be in use. Do I dare to automate many server reboots in a mentioned way at once and soon possibly find out that many servers are not booting in case of firmware bug or something like that?

 So I am trying to solve a very annoying issue that users are starting to notice and while I am aware this probably should go to the r/office365 section I am more interested to see if sysadmins have seen this and if they have, how did you solve it?
 Basically the users would be working in Outlook with calendars open capturing meetings and the like. When changing from one day to the next at one point Outlook will not draw the bottom part of the calendar and wherever you click Outlook will click that amount of cells not rendered up or down. See screenshot for the example, I clicked in the blank space but the selection was above my click. https://imgur.com/a/KxOkHv6
 Initially I thought this was an Azure Virtual Machine issue but I have since been able to recreate it on a physical machine as well. I have tried the latest Office beta but the issue persists. I have reinstalled Office, recreated the profile, used Online only mode, tried the reg key to disable hardware acceleration, tried different hardware, tried different accounts. At this point I don't know what else to try and suspect it is a flaw in Office because I have seen this with a different user who has reproduced it in Excel workbooks that have formulas that changes the display while it is running.
 I have a open ticket with MS on this but I thought I would ask here as well. Anyone else seen this before? If so how did you solve it?

 (here, mesh = wired mesh)
 I was checking a few mesh devices but all of them had this connection up to x number of devices.
 My question is, can we increase the number of devices that can be connected by increasing the number of APs in a mesh? (Assuming interference is not a problem)
 I checked Tp-link Deco XE75.
 Tp-link has written that it supports 200 devices but has not clarified that 200 in mesh or per AP.
 And if per AP, Does that mean 3AP = 600 devices in mesh?
 Thank you.

Is there a requirement for software dev? Before you ask I’m also reflecting these questions to the employer.

 I'm trying to hit a web server on a short lived AWS EC2 instance to diagnose an issue. I'm looking to tunnel web traffic back over SSH but I'm not having much luck.
 There isn't direct access to the VPC so I'm using a proxy command in my SSH config using AWS session manager to access it. Connecting via SSH works fine but now I'm trying to tunnel on top of that to hit the web server and I'm hitting a wall.
 My current SSH config looks something like ... And it allows me to SSH to the instance
 Host i-* IndentityFile ~important.pem User ec2-user UserKnownHostsfike /dev/null ServerKeepAlive 60 ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target &h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
 I've tried adding a Dynamic forward and and tweaking my browser to use that as the proxy but no dice
 Anyone got any ideas? I'm stumped

 I'm tasked with a very nice task from HR :-)
 They want to display a splash screen on computers after logging in on a specific date.
 It will be used to congratulate endusers with their birthday/wish them a happy halloween/happy new year and so on.
 In this first phase they will only use this for halloween. They want to play a short movie/gif to wish users a happy halloween. So this is static on a specific date/for every user.
 With GPO I can create a taskschd for this.
 Does anyone know a program or something like that (lightweight ofcourse) to perform this task? Eg: a media player that starts immediate full screen and exit/quit automatically for example.
 Thanks for giving me tips in this "nice" task ;-)

Cache static content vs Force cache all content. I think we will go with foce all content since we want all content to be cached.
 Client time to live: I see no reason to refresh the media ever. The videos cannot be changed by the users. Once uploaded they can just delete the post or keep it. So I see no reason to have such time to live at all. We would just set it to 1 year as that is the maximum time to select. Is that the right choice?
 Custom response headers and Negative Caching Policy: Do we need this at the beginning? Or should we just consider it later to further improve things?

 - 2 PC hangs in the first 24h.
 - Snipping tool --> Print, attempts to open a print dialog then disappears without doing nothing.
 - Copy that same picture and paste into notepad --> Print. Stays "printing" forever but it doesn't print.
 - Printers --> [Select printer] --> Open queue --> "You need an app to open ms-print-queue". Going "shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}", print queue opens fine. Test page from the printer prints no issues.
 - Run ESET installer --> "Do you want to look for the app in the Store?" instead of just installing. Even selecting "Yes", it throws an error.
 Everything above wasn't happening 24h ago with W10. Dear Microsoft, if the product is not ready, DON'T RELEASE IT.

 Recently I changed my LDAP login credentials, and I need to update them on SnipeIT configuration also.
 When I try to update it on LDAP Settings page it doesn't change anything. Every time I click "Save" nothing is saved and everything stays the same as before I entered new stuff.
 Thanks

 Not good.
 I'm not allowed to just jank the time several hours leaving overlaps or gaps in the timestamps. So I have to be very gentle.
 What is a good way to very slowly correct the time over a few days, weeks even. Adjust a minute every hour or something like that.

 We have since last week, blue screens on 3 platforms / Microsoft Surface - HP laptop - HP desktop
 People can connect to their session but when it finishes to load, they have a blue screen, this can happens 3/4 times in a row when users restart before they can use their computer.
 The errors are either Kernel Failure or Driver failure.
 We deploy our OS (Win10 21h2) with sccm.
 We are trying to find what is happening, we looked into event logs, updated drivers and firmware, forced Windows Update but it keeps happening. We have quite a few GPO at logon and some script at startup but nothing was changed these past 2 weeks. We don't understand why we get these blue screens like that.
 Do you have any other ideas for this ?

I asked why not just drop spectrum and go full AT&T he explained he saw an article in 2020 saying companies should have isp redundancy in case of outages. I don’t see how this wouldn’t do anything but cause a potential headache trying to trunk and manage seperate isps. Any thoughts on this?

 Just want to get ideas and best practices to achieve this. Essentially in the case that there are multiple branches and each branch has to pay/communicate with a vendors etc.
 Management wants to say create a PayPal account per branch. Is it best to create an entire new email for the branch specifically for this service. Branch already has an email ex: " [branch01@xyz.com](mailto:branch01@xyz.com) "
 My idea is to create a DL as ["pp-branch01@xyz.com](mailto:"pp-branch01@xyz.com)" and set its users ( managment) to view these emails and request as apposed to using the " [branch01@xyz.com](mailto:branch01@xyz.com)" .
 I know a drawback is that DL wont have a stored location compared to a mailbox but I feel like creating 2 emails is unnecessary. 
 Using a DL will also avoid the branch email reading the PayPal email not intended for them or even delete it.
 Im all ears to know how your org handles this, thank you!

 Others ask me to take tests that attempt to identify how I think, solve problems, get along with others, ECT. These I can sympathize with a little more, but they always ask you to take them after talking to the hiring person, not anyone that knows a ton about the job
 Am I way off base here? I think they're just looking to weed out applicants...

 Got kind of a weird question. 
 I got asked to configure some Juniper switches as a one time fee with certain QoS requirements. 
 I started making custom classifiers / queues but then after asking specific questions about what traffic was going to flow over this, the contacts response was "it's a standalone PA system. The only traffic going through it is PA traffic / multicast traffic, so just a single vlan"
 He wants 4 different queues setup, each with a different DSCP ranking but...
 if the ONLY traffic is multicast traffic running on one vlan...what's the point?

 Just came out of a long ass meeting with this guy (Bob), and every department manager under the sun. Bob was trying to throw me under the bus because his software installed on half of our endpoints couldn’t report back to the management console for 6 months now. He's saying how my environment is trash, that I botched the deployment, that I didn't go to him to test, blah blah blah...
 Rewind 6 months.. Bob reached out to me asking for help because suddenly nothing is reporting back to the console. I was running a project at the time, so I didn't have a lot of time to do a deep dive but a quick look was showing that the proxy is blocking the software from contacting the console. I sent an email saying just that and that he would need to log a ticket to the security team to get the sorted.
 I guess he didn't do that, now everything is urgent and it's my fault. Everyone is starting to side with Bob then having a go at me. So, I pull one of my contacts from security into the meeting, asked him to whitelist the URLs used by the software, and voila! Suddenly it's working. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT BOB?
 In my livid state, I dug up that email I sent and forwarded to everyone in that meeting, then left meeting abruptly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Our main corporate location has been suffering from a rather annoying issue for almost a year now. We have a 600 user office in the midwestern United States. The trouble is, Google is classifying our public IP addresses as being in Brazil. This is rather annoying for our users, as search results return the Brazilian versions of websites as well as the search results appearing in Portuguese.
 We can easily switch the search results to English, but the Brazilian websites still appear as first results.
 Normally you can enable the browser to detect your location (probably also through public IP), however we have an Edge group policy disabling this. We are unable to enable this due to security concerns (even though every website can view our public IP anyways).
 Ultimately it looks like the issue is an incorrect location mapping in Google’s geo-cache. I have submitted multiple automated requests to get this updated (using this: https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en). However after around 50 submissions over various months, nothing has changed.
 We are a full Microsoft shop with no Google products (so no line of sight to any direct Google support). Looking up our public IP’s using ARIN show the correct address information. Other browser and IP based location services also correctly identify our location.
 Has anyone ever ran into this issue or have any ideas on how to remediate it? I know it’s nothing on our computers because Google correctly identifies the IP location of our remote users and all of our other offices. Unfortunately it is this one office with the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Team, I've been fighting with a Vendor who is putting all the blame on us for slowness - say's it's our network.
 Here are FACTS: (All tests done during off hours, no backups running)
 Location A >> IPsec VPN >> Location B
  
127Mbps TCP Upload
 156Mbps TCP Download
 635Mbps UDP Upload
 654Mbps UDP Download
  
Location A >> IPsec VPN >> Vendor's Azure Instance
  
64Mbps TCP Upload
 284Mbps TCP Download
 420Mbps UDP Upload
 483Mbps UDP Download
  
Location B >> IPsec VPN >> Vendor's Azure Instance (Same Instance)
  
326Mbps TCP Upload
 278Mbps TCP Download
 411Mbps UDP Upload
 461Mbps UDP Download
  
All traffic we pass to the vendor is TCP.
 Vendor says there is a problem on Office A's Network.
 This is my argument - Office A (My main site) can pass 127Mbps of TCP Traffic to Office B (My remote site) over an IPsec VPN Tunnel. This should mean, at a minimum, I should be able to see at least 127Mbps of traffic from Office A, to the Vendors Azure Instance. I know our Router can pass at least 127Mbps, however we're only able to pass 56Mbps to the vendor.
 The vendor says their Azure server is not setup with an active/active VPN, just failover. They're stating there is no load balancers in place.
 What am I missing? This has to be some sort of routing issue between the ISP to Azure, or, some sort of bottleneck in the vendors Azure environment right?

 I work for a small but quickly growing business that has a number of employees working partly or fully remote. The company has been upgrading all of the networking equipment for our relatively small on-premise server/domain, but I'm still running into issues with RDP accessed through the client VPN provided through a Cisco Meraki MX64 SD-WAN.
 The RDP/VPN connection seems to struggle mostly with video but it also sometimes drops for no real apparent reason. It's out of my normal scope of work but I've been attempting to troubleshoot down to at least a general root cause.
 After doing quite a few pings/traceroutes/MTRs from the MX64 I've noticed that the ping to the local ISP node (50.46.181.20) seems to spike semi-regularly from very respectable numbers (1-10ms) to strangely much higher numbers (20-40ms). The connection can cope when I'm just doing office work but seems to push latency tests (performed via testmy.net/latency) on my local machine into the 200-300ms on certain video calls.
 I'm not hoping to pin down a specific cause with these tests, but would highly appreciate any insight into where I should look further.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone ever seen static routes just show up in the routing table for host addresses?
 This switch runs IOS 3.6.5e and license is IP base. You can see the static host addresses below with 0 AD and 0 for metric. Some point to a .2 address and others to .254 (172.31.11.235). There are no routing protocols enabled and no static routes in the config. Does anyone know what is injecting these routes and how the switch is ingesting them?
 ​
 SwitchStack1#sh ip route
 Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
 D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area
 N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
 E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2
 i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2
 ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route
 o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP
 + - replicated route, % - next hop override

 EDIT: My Environment is large enough that we may different kinds of climates, requirements and goals in many different situations with varying budgets. We have a few vendors but, not all needs are for servers. I'm not so sure that they care either.
 That said, its nice to know whats out there and what people are using and what their projects are.
 For example i didn't know Eaton had Lithium based Batteries in their UPS line. I happen to know if not over charged Lithium Ion can last notably longer than lead acid, and Lithium Iron Phosphate Far longer than Lithium Ion. So the idea of Lithium based Units is quite interesting!

 We use an ITIL based system so some tickets are termination requests where they were properly termed, just not archived yet. Those I'm not too worried about (actually looks to be about 100 of them)
 But how do you handle 100s of incidents/break-fixes? Sometimes getting answers from people are pulling teeth with tweezers. Sometimes its a legit issue but there's just no good fix at the moment. I'd love to get this under control. I've added rules and tweaked the logic on the ticket system to require people to reply to tickets if I've replied to them (7 days from my reply, ticket automatically closed).

 [My cell phone rings - personal phone, but I also use it for business]Some Guy: Hi! I work for [company]. I got your info from LinkedIn [NOTE: my LinkedIn profile DOES NOT include my phone number at all] and I was wondering if you have a few minutes to talk about what tools you're currently using to secure your cloud infrastructure?
 Me: [context-switching and baffled] I can't talk now.
 SG: When can I give you a call later?
 Me: You can't.
 [CLICK, END]
 Listen, I'm not sure who needs to hear this, but if you are in sales and your job description includes a part where basically you need to cold call companies and try to social engineer their tech people, then I need to inform you that you, your job, the company you work for, or some combination of all three, truly suck and you should feel ashamed of yourself.
 If, however, you are actually a Black Hat, then.... you're doing a bang-up job! Keep going with your bad self!

On some of my switches I have trunking ports where every VLAN is tagged, but somehow you you can access the management IP of the switch. The only time I have been able to access the management IP on switches (on other networks) is when I untag the management interface on the switch, but tag ever other vlan.
 ​
 Am I doing something wrong, is it bad to untag a vlan in a trunking port?

 ex:
 Trunk1
 Vlan1 Tagged
 Vlan2 Tagged
 Vlan3 Untagged

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to RDMA technology, and I'm confused by several rdma libraries. I cannot figure out the relationship among them. The libraries and kernel headers I'm confused with are as follows: 
 1.rdma-core/libibverbs
 2.rdma-core/librdmacm
 3.linux-5.4.2/include/rdma
 4.linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi/rdma
 My question is: 
 1.As far as I know. libibverbs provides the userspace applications with verbs api(i.e. functions with prefix ibv_), but it does not offer any connection-related functions, so applications need to exchange connection information using sockets(I see this operation in the libibverbs example rc_pingpong.c). librdmacm provides the user with easier connection management mechanism(e.g. rdma_get_cm_event). However, it seems that librdmacm does more work than connection management, since it also defines several apis(e.g. rdma_create_qp in rdma_cma.h) which looks similar to the ibv_function in libibverbs. So I do not know whether librdmacm is a superset of libibverbs? If not, what's the relationship between them?
 2.In the example rc_pingpong.c of libibverbs, I cound see it includes the header file verbs.h, and it seems that linux-5.4.2/include/rdma and linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi do not play any role in the program(no heaer files in these two directories are included). So what are the header files in these two directories aimed at? 
 I have refer to several materials but have not made it clear. Any explanation or related resources are well-appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently have been working on moving our org to a security-key based MFA solution considering the various attacks against more traditional push, SMS, call, or TOTP MFA solutions. 
 As part of this process, I started looking at the various avenues of attack that could bypass FIDO/FIDO2/U2F MFA style authentication. Previously I would use something like EvilGoPhish to phish employees/customers and steal their session cookies to bypass MFA but this does not work with U2F.
 Then I came across an article that mentioned using WebUSB to defeat YubiKey and of course where one attack exists, other attacks also exist.
 The important quote from this entire article.
  
"Vervier and Orrù found that they could code a website to connect to the Yubikey Neo with that WebUSB feature, instead of with the usual Chrome API for U2F that it's designed to use. In doing so, they could circumvent the checks that the browser performs before querying the Yubikey—the checks that confirm that websites are the ones they claimed to be." 
  
Thankfully STIG has descriptions of how to disable both WebUSB and its sister technology WebBluetooth.
  
Disable WebUSB
 Disable WebBluetooth
 
 TL;DR WebUSB can be used for novel attacks to attack local security keys and bypass MFA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In CISCO- and Linksys-documentation it states:
 The device reserves VID 4095 as the Discard VLAN and VID 4094 for 802.1x. All packets classified to the Discard VLAN are discarded at ingress, and are not forwarded to a port.
 Can someone explain to me what the purpose of a "Discard VLAN" is and how it can help shape traffic in a network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm setting up a lab in GNS3 to pilot enabling DHCP snooping and Dynamic ARP inspection. I got this setup and working properly with a Nexus 7k image, but it doesn't support port channels and I want to setup my lab to mirror the real environment as closely as possible. I got the Nexus 9k 10.1.1 image from Cisco and have it all configured, but I can't enable arp inspection because it says the ether-region needs to be set in TCAM. I've tried to do this but it throws an error. Trying to set any of the existing TCAM region entries to 0, saving the config, and rebooting results in no changes being made. There is a screenshot here - https://imgur.com/92E7B3a with more detail.
 Does anyone have any advice on how I can make this work?

 We have now run into the problem of to many SSIDs
 These SSIDs span over 2000 access points across the entire plant and we need them on every ap for roaming (I can't profile down any further)
 From what I can see from other large deployments companies are moving towards a few SSIDs with a large capacity -- eg instead of 4 SSIDs with 2000 clients we would have 1 ssid and call it "Manufacturing" and create a /20 network for it.. this also allows us to add more vlans to the blank group if we ever need to expand its size.
 We might also create 2 SSIDs 1 with FT and another with just adaptive.
 What are you large wireless folks doing.. looking for advice and reasons why to go one way over another

We're talking 100+ or so of them. This was done about a week or so ago. Monday, while i was checking my MM a bunch of the (down) APs popped up again on the MM. Minor nuisance really, as my APs in prod are working fine, but it's just weird that some came back. A lot of them had partial names to them too: e.g. an AP labelled "A-102" showed up as "A-10", etc. 
 ​
 Any idea what happened here? The only thing i can think of that changed was our Solarwinds alerting was enabled after the deployment was done. It wouldn't make sense since that's on the SW side.

It appears from message trace in Exchange Online, that one person on a distribution list (used for enquiries are sent from their website) are having them sent straight to their Junk Folder. 
 I've asked them to mark the domain as safe, but they are still being delivered to junk. I've looked in PowerShell using the get-inbox rule to see if they've set anything, but it gets no results. 
 It seems odd behavior that an internal email address would marked as junk for one user. Has anyone else seen this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in my IT shop the security teams seems to run everything, and make all the decisions. The security team is not super tech savvy to put it nicely , but will just log into server and make changes not knowing what they are doing. An example it logging into Windows servers and stop/disabling the firewall service. They seem to be making all the decisions for the enterprise environment, software to use or not use. I am not talking like we will not allow some software because we see it as a security issue which is actually their job, but like running the evaluation of major software like Okta (which i like by the way) then buying it and forcing it on the rest of IT without their testing or input. They seem to spec out the hardware not just say ever device needs to be from proper sources and have TPM etc. But they have no idea about hardware or how it works. They are opposed to anything open source which kills me. I am very cautious about open source, but sometimes it just is needed. To many example for non open source vendors with huge security issues that they don't fix or disclose. Security by obscurity. They love to hold everyone's feet to the fire about change control but do impacting things without using the change board, nor notifying the impacted persons. Like someday getting an e-mail from the application that your admin privileges are gone without any notice. CIO seems to be ok with this. Like cyber is doing all the work on the move the cloud? 
 This all seems really backwards for me, but I need perspective. My idea of security it to set policy, weigh in on enforcement changes, set infrastructure goals for the actual sysadmins to move toward a more secure posture, deal with incidents, and stuff like that. Not hands on doing IT's job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all - Our org wil be making a decision to consolidate some dated hardware next year and we are on the hunt for a decent HCI solution to host our VMware cluster which is currently running 3 tier on UCS for compute, cisco FIs and nexus for network, and Pure for Storage.
 I'm a past Nutanix customer and had nothing but good experiences with those appliances, but for whatever reason our higher ups dislike the name and brand because our past appliances were "slow" and "clunky" and didn't seem interested in hearing about how we were past due for refreshes as we were one of the early adopters of nutanix back in 2013 and were still running essentially 8 year old gear. its a bit of a long and complicated story, but we had to gut all our nutanix stuff after covid budget cuts happened, So i just have a feeling Nutanix wont be considered.
 the other 2 contenders we are looking at are Dell vxrail and HPE dHCI. I'd like to ask which of these 2 would you go with if you had a choice? or if there is something different all together you'd recommend? the VM cluster is very overprovisioned for what we have, so this will be a bit of a rightsizing attempt based on current workloads. consuming about 40-50GHz of CPU at rest, 500GB of Memory, and about 15TB of storage. a full flash solution would be my preference to keep our IOPS performance equivalent to Pure. Cloud is not an option at this point

 Despite my many efforts to use a ticketing system, they say "we have tried in the past but it just doesn't work" we have a Microsoft to-do list because according to them it's essentially the same thing. This leads me to often get either in trouble or my wrist slapped because I'm "working on things that are not important" and it leads me to get calls from my boss regularly, or when I have all my obvious projects done for the day I get the "What are you doing right now" which sometimes is "Nothing" which is never a good answer but its an honest one. 
 I've just been so frustrated, especially since the pay is $4 an hour less than my best friend who does very similar work 10 minutes away. it Doesn't help that my boss seems bipolar half the time, I am 21, and he is around 24 so we will often talk about girls, cars, etc. but a lot of the time I feel treated like a dog, it's like he treats me like I don't know anything and will talk down to me and just generally treats me bad. 
 I'm really conflicted, I overall like it here, and I've only been here a year but it's becoming so much more often that I think "I could just leave right here and now"

 Today... that update is gone and I'm back on the older version. I don't know if this is Microsoft backpedaling or just something weird with my machine.
 Anyone else noticing the changes and/or experience user calls? 
 More info: the latest version for windows - October 12th presents a significant update to the Electron Framework. from 10.x to 16.x Likely the cause of the issues/bugs, because you know, Microsoft likes to QA/Beta Test on customers now.

 I've been configuring an Intune environment, which is working fine for Windows/Autopilot, however I do see there are MacOS options. I'm wondering how useful this is, to those of you that have worked with Mac in Intune.
 I'm assuming autopilot is out of the question, and our help desk will still need to do some manual stuff, but I'm hoping some could shed light on a few questions:
  
Is there an OS deployment function for MacOS, similar to Autopilot?
 These are just going for be for a full AzureAD environment, not hybrid. Does that make a difference?
 The laptop will need a local user account created, right?
 Can we register all of the Macs to a single Apple ID, in the event of a user forgetting their password or something?
 Is a local admin account possible, if so, doable through Intune?
 Lastly, any recommendations for remote control software. I've used ManageEngine, TeamViewer, Dameware in the past. Not sure Dameware is even a thing anymore, TeamViewer might be possible but looking for what you guys have found to be most efficient.

 Apparently, OME is using ECB encryption which seems to be not much of a step above message obfuscation instead of being a secure encryption method.
 So, if you have a requirement to send secure email, OME is not meeting that requirement.

My theory is if it can do that, I could trunk it to a dummy switch and have it power my trailer. Help? Anyone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 We have a product which sends out system notifications to our customers Sysadmins etc. We use SendGrid to send these emails (which works like a charm BTW).
 However - several of our customers are asking if we can send the e-mail from their domain (so that the FROM field would be ["someone@customerdomain.com](mailto:"@customerdomain.com)".
 I've looked into the whole authenticated domain setup in SendGrid (which we went through ourselves) - and this seems like the correct approach. However: 
 1) What would the most "correct" approach be? Should we create a subuser and then authenticate domains for each of our customers on this subuser? Sending our customers the SPF record etc. generated by SendGrid.
 2) We're not all that interested in doing this manually every time a customer asks. Does anyone have experience with using the SendGrid API for authenticating domains? 
 I'm a developer (not a Sysadmin), so I'm a bit worried to mess something up. Basically we just want to use our SendGrid account to send emails from different domains (approved by the owners of the domains).
 Could anyone walk me through the correct way to do this?
 I've tried reaching out to SendGrid support, but they just keep sending me to the same "How authenticated domains work"-article, which doesn't explain the scenario I'm interested in. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I currently have a MAN with ~20 sites interconnected with dark fibers, in a sort of a ring topology, plus a dozen WAN sites. All these sites are l2 connected (even WAN sites with metro-ethernet) so I have sometimes typical l2 issues (broadcast storm, stp misconfig...). To overcome these problems, I am thinking of doing a redesign of this network with consultants but before meeting them, I would like your views on what are the current technologies used for this type of network and what are the pro/cons.
 My needs: 
 - L3VPN but also sometimes L2VPN for legacy applications, 
 - the simpler solution the best from an exploitation point of view, 
 - ideally throughtput between sites should be 40+/50+ Gbps
 - and stable (but does it really need to be specified :-)
 I did some research, there seems to be 3 main technologies for this type of network: evpn/vxlan, traditional mpls, and sr mpls which seems to be the "new simplified" mpls (perhaps i overlooked some). From a budget standpoint, the evpn/vxlan solution seems cheaper because available on switchs, and mpls seems to be available only on router hardware which could be expensive if i need to go for 50+ Gbps interfaces.
 ​
 Thank you for your help.

I don't see anything different in the communication either before or after the nic disabling except that the browser loads. I see no certificate failures and that is not something showing as the issue on the browser. It also happens if the page is internal to our company or external. We have had the desktop tech update the nic drivers but I don't think that's the cause. We have had the proxy server bypassed for the testing machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We are used to have dedicated management interfaces on network devices. As more and more functions/features are hosted on x86 devices, it's natural to implement the same management mechanism.
 To avoid mixing management and data planes, multiple routing tables have to be implemented. There are, from my understanding, three ways to do it :
 - namespace
 - table + ip rule from/to
 - vrf (added to linux kernel thanks to cumulus)
 Excluding namespaces which are too heavy for this need, what could differenciate the two last propositions?
 I can feel that vrf have a stronger implementation/traffic isolation but it seems that the result are approximately the same ?
 Thank you,
 Romain

I was wondering if there was any benefit to blacklisting these clients after repeated failed auth for a period of time? Am I right to think this would free up some AP capacity as they will ignore that client for the duration of the blacklisting meaning less resources are wasted on talking to a client that is failing auth. Any other suggestions on how to improve welcome. Thanks.

According to a new study from Wanclouds, 81% of IT leaders say their C-suite has directed them to reduce or take on no additional cloud spending as costs skyrocket and market headwinds worsen. After multiple years of unimpeded cloud growth, the findings suggest enterprises’ soaring cloud spending may tempered as talks of a looming downturn heat up.
 As organizations move forward with digital transformations they set out on at the beginning of the pandemic, multicloud usage is becoming increasingly unwieldy, and costs are difficult to manage across hybrid environments.
 Furthermore, a wrench has been thrown into IT teams’ plans over the last two quarters in the form of the market tumult. Rising inflation and interest rates, along with fears of a potential recession have put increasing financial and operational strain on organizations. As a result, many companies are reevaluating their digital ambitions as cloud spending is brought under the microscope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Since about a year, Microsoft refuses to offer us support through Teams-calls and instead only wants to reach out by phone. For us, having calls over the phone instead of Teams is quite inconvenient as we prefer having multiple team-members on the support call at the same time. Of course, it's possible to have multi-person phone calls, but it's obviously not as optimized as Teams. Also, scheduling Teams-meetings through the calendar in Outlook (which we used to do) instead of 'verbally' by mail brings the added benefit of not having to miss calls because the support-engineer mixed up his timezones. Finally, sharing single screens through Teams is better than being forced to share your entire desktop through Quick Assist.
 Does anybody know why they do this? When we ask, they avoid the question. For us, it's both inconvenient, irritating and strange, because it looks like they deem Teams to be an unsafe way of communicating. Before this, I generally had great experiences with MS Support, but this is just really annoying.

 I own a company that does apartments and storage rentals and it is way less stressful. Sure you have to deal with tenants, but you don't have another IT department making you use their systems just to do business with them.

 Here's the deal:
  
There is an office with two floors, each with a different type of user. Type "A" use the Windows keyboard layout "X" and type "B" use the Windows keyboard layout "Y".
 Each floor has its own VLAN and DHCP server.
 Computers may be arbitrarily moved between floors, so the same computer may be used by both user types.
 All computers and users are domain joined. All computers are in the same OU. "A" type users are in the "A" OU and "B" type users are in the "B" OU.
 Each computer has a hypervisor running a Windows VM. Every time a computer is shut down, the VM goes back to its original state.
 All computers shut down automatically at 21:00 and turn on automatically at 07:00.
  
How would you ensure user type "A" has the Windows keyboard layout "X" preconfigured on the Windows logon screen?
 How would you ensure user type "B" has the Windows keyboard layout "Y" preconfigured on the Windows logon screen?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I have tried with a powershell computer startup script that changes the relevant registry values depending on the Windows VM gateway, but it doesn't work (it works if executed manually after user login, so it's not a scripting issue), maybe because when the script is executed Windows doesn't have a gateway yet?
 Here's the part of the script I used to get the gateway:
  
$ip = Get-NetIPConfiguration | Foreach IPv4DefaultGateway | Select-Object NextHop
 $gateway = $ip.NextHop.ToString()
  
Going passwordless is my last resort!

 I have a server and I need to read around 200files per second, they are image TIFF sequences and the size per file can be from 100kps to 3megas. I need to read this files in Real Time and it works but after a while (30seconds) the read times slow down a bit as the drives/bandwidth has reached the limit and needs more time to deliver the files.
 I currently have a server grade NVME PCI gen 3 raid controller (don't have the server in hand) and it handles 8nvmes. I have it set for Raid 0 but maybe on my specific case could Raid 1 be more beneficial?
 The reason I'm wondering this that if the controller asks for a single 100kps file to 8 diferent drives and needs to wait for all 8 to provide the data before it can proceed to the next file and it needs to do this 200 times a second maybe on Raid 1 2 drives have the same file and could potentially provide a more consistent random access performance?
 This is very specific and um trying to get some more knowledge. Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently looking at the possibility of installing Windows Hello for Business across our organisation. However, for security reasons, we would like to force users to type their password in at least once week, instead of a PIN or using their face/biometrics. This will mean that they will have to type their long passwords and the system would block them from using any other sign-in method in particular instance.
 We plan to roll out Windows Hello for Business via Intune.
 Is this possible to do and if so, how can we go about doing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing some clever (stupid?) routing between leaf (bgp, L3 fabric) and openstack (software routing in overlays).
 I got to the point, when I have two (or more) routes, and only one is valid (i.e. can deliver traffic to the consumer). The difference between them is that in one case there is active nexthop IP, and in other there is none. Nexthop is connected through a bridge, therefore it's impossible to use link state to check if nexthop is available or not. The single way is to check if it can be resolved via arp.
 There are other ways to solve my problem (healthchecks, hooks into openstack code, etc), but I wanted to investigate feasibility of the nexthop 'resolving' (in this context, resolving of IP into MAC, i.e. arp). Are there the name of this technique? Is someone using it?
 Basically, I have a route:
  x.x.x.0/24 via y.y.y.y dev foobar 
 And this route should only be taken in account when y.y.y.y can be seen as a neighbor in ip neighbors, and ignored, if not.
 I use bird for bgp, so it's either bird feature (check nexthop resolvability), or linux routing feature.
 Is this a thing, or should I try other ways?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We planning to migrate the CA within the same domain. The Old Certificate Authority (Legacy Cryptographic Provider) has permission to issue the Old smartcard logon v3 certificate template. The new Certificate Authority (Crypto Next Generation) has permission to issue the New smartcard logon v4 certificate template (both templates are configured the same except for the cryptography tab). The most interesting customization in the templates below:
 In both templates, the following parameters are configured in the Issuance Requirements tab:
 This number of authorized signatures 1
 application policy
 Certificate Request Agent
 Valid existing certificate
 We have a lot of users using smart cards to logon, to reduce the load on our help desk (enrollment agent) we want to use the Supersedence template. So that our users can reissue certificates on their own / autoenrollment. To do this, use the criterion in the Issuance Requirements tab: Valid existing certificate
 In the New smart card logon certificate template, the Supersedens template tab contains the Old smartcard logon certificate template, certificate templates are replaced correctly with us.
 The question is:
 The user receives a request to renew/autoenroll the certificate in tray OS balloon, the user sees the required template that has been replaced ( New smartcard logon ), but when continuing to work with the certificate issuance wizard, the user is requested to sign the enrollment agent.
 Tell me, is this because the certificate issued by the Old smartcard logon template does not fall under the Valid existing certificate flag for the New smartcard logon template certificate?
 Do I understand correctly that this will not work without an enrollment agent in such a configuration?
 We cannot refuse to use the enrollment agent, we must control new users and issue a certificate for them.
 Thank you for help.

Basically my role is to take care of a POC environment AKA lab manager for their pre & post sales engineers to deploy their respective solutions for demo to their potential customers. The problem is, I have no idea what's going on with my lab and my reporting manager then was too busy to entertain my inquiry, most of the time they outright ignore me.
 After a year for some reason I've been assigned to a new reporting manager who happens to be the principal SA for the lab. Met them privately to discuss my dissatisfaction and what I really want for years to come. In the end they promised to get me involved more in whatever pertaining to the lab and to be frank, I don't buy it. I was right though because so far it's same shit just different person.
 This really demotivates me as I believe what they're doing devalues me as an experienced engineer for 7 years not to mention the jobscope that they promised during the hiring is far from the reality. I'm more than just that guy who holds CMDB for the lab and gives "consultation" to presales engineers every single day. Been thinking of jumping ship so far not landing any gig.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm currently looking for console server data solution for mainly Cisco devices. What do you think about out of band (SIM CARD or wifi based(?) ) console servers - theoretically sounds very good - how about the practice ?
 Also there're some other requirements we would like to have:
  
minimum of 16 interfaces
 possibility to use RJ45 to RJ45 UTP cables for simplicity and longer range cross-rack connectivity (than simple Cisco console cables).
 Continuing from 2 - the device should be able to rollover programmatically that cable (also - how this function is called - (software selectable pins) ?). Because manually changing pins from straight through to rollover in UTP cable from standard is not very sustainable solution. In Ethernet world similar thing is called auto-mdix - it's interesting how this thing is called in serial world :)
  
Any suggestions ? Thanks

When testing LAPS, we have set the name of the administrator account to manage to be RAccess, and were expecting to see the LAPS password applied to that account. What is happening is that the disabled built in administrator account is being re-enabled, renamed to RAccess2 and the LAPS password is being applied to that account. We're rolling out the client via SCCM, and have tried installing it both before and after adding the devices to an OU with LAPS set up. Any ideas where to go next would be appreciated. Everything that I have read suggests that LAPS will not create, enable or rename accounts. We can recover the LAPS password OK, so it looks as all Schema and OU setup has been done correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 A bit of background - I'm helping out a small tax office that has two sites. Site one has 5 desktops and the other has 2. 
 Site one has a Synology Nas Active Directory environment. 
 Site two the users have an account on each pc. 
 They want to be able to share files between the two sites and use roaming profiles.
 I don't like the Synology and would like them on a windows environment. 
 I'm use to supporting a large corporate IT environment. So the solutions that I'm use to just don't make business sense to a Small office. 
 If one of you can prescribe us a setup that would be awesome!
 A traditional option and a cloud hybrid option.
 Thank you for reading :D

 I currently operate an enterprise network that had almost no distribution layer. Our biggest campuses go switched access layer -> SVIs on the core switches. Recently I implemented a routed distribution layer across an ELAN. I am toying with the idea of using QinQ to support a cookie cutter config style for access layer switches while preserving unique address space per different access areas under the same distribution or core switch. 
 For example, building group A will have different /24s for it's SVIs than building group B, even though both use a switched access layer that goes back to the same routing distro switch in building group A. The standar…]]></summary>

 I'm testing a firewall in my lab, decided to do a little BGP just for kicks and ended up here. In the past few hours, I've learned all sorts of strange things in regards to rules that some ISPs have when peering with customers. Are ISPs generally that anal when peering with customers? With the ease of filtering with BGP, why?

A week later (Today) a head hunting company contacts me on indeed about a job "i would be PERFECT for".. Guess which job it was for.. Yep, the one that rejected me. I told them they rejected me and they asked if I want to apply anyways I told em "Screw it, Go for it lets see what happens". Thats when I get another email about a job in my town from a different head hunter company, and then another, and another, and another. So far 7 different head hunters from different companies have contacted me regarding this position. I've said yes to every single one. Why? Because f--k them, thats why.

 Had an engineer be a complete asshole because, "outlook" wasn't working. Spent an hour and half with him fixing things that didn't need fixing.
 Been at this specific company for almost 4 years and this is the 2nd occurrence of a worker having an attitude towards me ever. The first was just a new hire that needed an attitude check and literally was an asshole in front of the IT manager and IT director. So they backed me and even commended me for not retaliating. 
 We have no help desk. I was promoted years ago and they never replaced me. So for about 200+ it's primarily me juggling stupid help desk and admin/engineering work with my boss helping occasionally. 
 All of this guys tickets are closed and resolved. Like it's my fault he doesn't ask to reopen tickets or put new ones in if something reoccurs. My bad I'm not babysitting you non stop while I have 1000 other things to do.
 Now my evening is off to a irate start because this jackass can't put tickets in or be a normal person like literally everyone else. My bad!

 Is that practice still considered best? I've been seeing automated emails from vendors with the FROM address being the root domain. Are they just being careless? Obviously best practices are likely applied, (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)... but is that considered enough to the point where companies are using their root domain to send automated emails out that way.

I'm also now trying to include in my question are there any specific certifications that are within reach of my high school kids?

 Hi folks,
 ​
 I'm a high school teacher, running a great computer science department and we recently added a (for college credit) course in information security.
 ​
 I'm attempting to find out some information for the sake of my students interested in working in this field. I was hoping to get some guidance on credentials, certifications, college education, that sort of thing.
 I'm not the type of teacher who wants to just tell all of his students to go get a bachelor's degree if it's not necessarily going to suit them well for their career. Are there other ideas out there that are more appropriate? Do you need a B.S. to even get in the door? What subject area(s)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For any ISPs offering 10G DIA or XGSPON links to residential and SMB customers, what sort of gateway are they using and how is the performance?
 I don't have any 10G equipped gateways to play with so I'm messing around with some servers and 10G NICs. Here's the lab, all are Dell R620s with dual Xeon E5-2670, 32GB of memory, and Intel X520-DA2 NICs connected with DACs:
 Server A 172.16.0.1/30 | Server B "WAN" 172.16.0.2/30 "LAN" 192.168.1.1/24 | Server C 192.168.1.100/24 (DHCP) 
 Servers A and C are running Debian 11 on fresh installs. Server B is running pfsense with a basic NAT configuration. Server A is running iperf3 as a server. Server C is iperf3 client.
 If I boot up iperf3 and do a regular test from Server C to Server A:
 upload [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [ 5] 0.00-60.04 sec 38.0 GBytes 5.44 Gbits/sec receiver download [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [ 5] 0.00-60.04 sec 26.3 GBytes 3.76 Gbits/sec 89 sender bidir [ ID][Role] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [ 5][RX-S] 0.00-60.03 sec 37.0 GBytes 5.29 Gbits/sec receiver [ 8][TX-S] 0.00-60.03 sec 25.7 GBytes 3.68 Gbits/sec 72 sender 
 Of course, better results with 8 threads:
 upload (-P8) [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [SUM] 0.00-60.02 sec 54.6 GBytes 7.82 Gbits/sec receiver download (-P8) [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [SUM] 0.00-60.01 sec 49.6 GBytes 7.10 Gbits/sec 685 sender bidir (-P8) [ ID][Role] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [SUM][RX-S] 0.00-60.01 sec 40.3 GBytes 5.77 Gbits/sec receiver [SUM][TX-S] 0.00-60.01 sec 26.8 GBytes 3.84 Gbits/sec 224 sender 
 I notice the bidirectional performance is slightly better, but basically the same with more threads. Is this a NIC limitation or possibly tuning? I know the x520 is fairly old by now. 
 Has anyone done any testing like this? Has anyone tested NAT throughput on more affordable hardware like Mikrotik or Ubiquiti?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding is that if let's say there are multiple devices in a LAN and device A wants to make request to a webserver on the internet -
 Source IP of A will be replaced with the IP of the router from the packet which is going out to the WAN.
 So if the source was 10.10.0.1:9876 and IP of router was 125.12.31.7 then router will translate source to 125.12.31.7:5000 (5000 being a random available port) 
 Now the router will note down :
 Source : 125.12.31.7:5000 = 10.10.0.1:9876 
 So that when the packet comes back from the server it will look up in the table and send it to the Computer A. 
 If this computer A had made multiple requests, they all would have been allotted different portnumbers from the available pool. Same if Computer B had made a request. 
 So basically it's the unique port number which is being used here to determine where to send the packed when it enters router from outside world. 
 What if the number of requests from within the LAN to WAN exceeded the number of available port numbers? What would happen? I mean there are only 64,512 (65,535 -1,023) available ports at max.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! Been lurking in this thread for a LONG time, but figured this would be as good a time as any to finally post. My IT Director asked me to look into finding a Smart Card solution so that employees can log into PCs. We're a small Hospital and many of the nurse stations have give or take 5 communal PCs that they need to log into the domain to use. I've tried convincing my boss to remove that step and just use a limited Kiosk account as all patient information is locked behind a second login and a remote connection (Parallells), but that's been like trying to pull teeth. So, I'm trying to make this as easy as possible for our staff to log into their accounts and get things done. Any ideas for a badge scan or fingerprint solution to speed up the process? I really don't have a lot of experience in this very specific subject and Googling this subject has been a mess. Figured you guys would have at least some recommendations.

 Do a little recon and digging - his .ost file (Outlook is locally caching) is just under 50GB. He "has" to be delegate on 10+ people's accounts too. "Shockingly", he is not accepting this as the reason for his problem.
 He definitely is not liking my suggestions.
 Edit: please note, per the below MS article
  
Very large (25 GB or larger): An .ost file of this size increases the frequency of short pauses, especially while you are downloading new email messages.
  
and
  
In Outlook 2010 and later versions, the maximum size for a .pst file is 50 GB.

 Edit 2: so, I think I've talked him down off the cliff. I removed his profile and created a new one. I am watching the .ost grow though so we'll see where this story ends...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to solve an issue in our environment where, as developers continue to work remotely, we have homebrew devices that need to be on our network to recieve code pushes from our Jenkins servers. These devices are all custom and not capable of having additional software installed on them.
 I have attempted to connect these devices to GlobalProtect enabled RaspberryPi devices, sharing the GP IP, which gives them access into our network, but this solution fails because the devices are not visible behind the Pi, and are not reachable to have code pushed to them.
 We have deployed at least 1 home firewall for a key developer but this is not a sustainable approach. Is anyone familiar with a product that would fit this need, or deployed something similar?
 Also, ideally the solution would have some sort of security (at least MAC auth) so that any random device can not connect to our network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I'm wondering what sort of laptops your companies are giving out to users these days? 
 We formerly had desktops, but we moved to a new office that the CEO insisted on setting up as a flexible workspace, so everyone needed laptops, and then covid showed up and we went remote.
 We currently have MS Surfaces (the CEO's choice) through a 3rd party vendor. Most people seem to really like them, but I'm getting complaints from a few people that then need more powerful ones. Particularly a few people complain about the amount of ram they come with. I've got a user insisting they need at least 64 GB of ram to work properly, more than is available in a surface. I'm deeply skeptical of this particular user's claim, but that's a different issue. I sent him to his department head to argue with him about getting the budget. If he actually gets budget to buy one, I'll need to source it whether I think he really needs it or not. 
 Anyway, what sort of laptops do you all like to send out? How much ram do they typically have?

 I recently took a new job and was hired to help get a new software up and running. As I'm going through the requirements, I can't find the options they want. I do my best, then email the software support asking if I'm missing anything. The support emails back that what I need isn't even an option available. 
 So who authorized this? If the software can't do the main thing you want it to do, who agreed to purchase it?!? Was the request even asked to the selling company before purchasing? What am I going to do with this software now? Thousands of dollars wasted.
 I'll never know because I joined on after it was already purchased. But holy shit does it get me heated. End rant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've inherited a network that is using public IPs inside it's LAN. I've been tasked to begin cleaning these up and make them proper private IPs. Another fun fact about this network is that the original designer tagged Vlan 1 on all uplink ports. Of course Vlan 1 is still also the default & native vlan throughout the network. Our main data subnet, cameras and door controls are all on Vlan 1 across the entire company.
 The project requirement is to implement department vlans at our main site and have a few other vlans at other remote sites as needed. Of course they want to move the cameras off the data subnet and also use vlans for IOT, printers, and a few other departments at some sites.
 Our WAN is connected using AT&T Metro ASE Layer 2. We have an Aruba 3810 L3 Switch as the gateway at each site. IP Routing is enabled on each of these L3 Switches.
 We have 12 remote sites, STP is in use at each site, but we only connect using static routes. No ospf, rip, bgp, etc.
 My initial thought is to first install all of the new subnets/vlans throughout the network. Then slowly begin moving the Vlan 1 devices over to the new subnets. We have a server team that will handle most of the systems that will need their IP changed so my main task is to ensure connectivity.
 How would you handle moving users off of Vlan 1 onto the new subnets? For all you L2 WAN folks, is there a better way to approach this?
 I appreciate your thoughts & inputs.

 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-22h2
 ​
  
Microsoft has received reports that after installing KB5018427, some types of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) connections might have handshake failures. Note for developers: Affected connections are likely to be sending multiple frames within a single input buffer, specifically one or more complete records with a partial record that is less than 5 bytes all sent in a single buffer. When this issue is encountered, your app will receive SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE when the connection fails.
  
​
 I am about to do some testing with the monthly update and wondering what I should look for that might necessitate the OoB patch to also be deployed along with the cumulative.

 In my last position, the remotes used RDP over VPN (with 2FA) which was plenty snappy with fiber at the office, and I also used ConnectWise for support. I found ConnectWise a less responsive in general than RDP but not unbearable, but I preferred RDP for fulltime work.
 RDS/Citrix would be overkill at my present position as a one-man show in a small office with just a couple of FT remotes and a few people who sometimes work remotely.
 ConnectWise Control Access pricing is very attractive. I would prefer to use it for support anyway, so I wanted to hear what others were doing in smaller offices with limited remote users.

 I've recently started working as a sysadmin + network guy for a small business, around 50 employees and up to a 100 devices if we take into account mobile phones.
 The company has a dumpster tier firewall that's basically not doing anything and a vm running pfsense for openvpn. There are around 8 ubiquiti 'enterprise' switches in the network and a few APs. 
 I would like to replace the firewall with something a bit more manageable and feature rich. Naturally i'm thinking of Fortinet etc for the price but I've also seen the Dream Machine Pro from Ubiquiti which has the features we need at a really low price (I assume it's not a great unit...) and would allow me to manage the rest of our switches centrally. You can't even monitor traffic on the switches without a gateway anyway which sucks so I'm tempted to go down this route instead.
 If the dream machine pro supported openvpn for remote workers I would grab it but it doesn't so I'm still hesitant. 
 Do you guys think it's better to grab an actual enterprise level switch from Fortinet or maybe a pfsense plus box from netgate instead of a dream machine pro?

 Do you have a smaller banlist which be usable on low config ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing this, because unfortunately - on an almost daily basis - I see people that have this habit.
 Do not run the PowerShell as an Administrator, unless you absolutely need to. So, when do you need to? When you are changing local system setting or deleting/modifying files that only Administrators have access to. When in doubt, run PowerShell normally and just try to run the command you wanna run.
 You never need to run a PowerShell as an Administrator, when you are remotely configuring resources, through PSSessions, CIM/WMI, or when using any other cmdlet that has a -Credentialparameter, such as the AD module.
 The gist of it is this: If you do not know why you need admin permissions, you should not use admin permissions.

 My question is, what specific certificate does it need? I would assume either SSL or code-signing, but as this is neither necessarily a website or an actual program to be deployed (it's just for PS automation), I'm not sure what would be considered appropriate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, more details here, I couldn't catch the first BSOD, but while updating it also crashed a couple times, then it successfully installed the update, but even then it kept crashing.
 The errors I got were:
  
Irql not less or equal
 
Kmode exception not handled
 
Page fault in nonpaged area
 
Unexpected kernel mode trap
 
 This was all very late into the night so I decided to shut it off from bios when I got the chance and now today I decided to remove some plugged in USB devices and I also removed my second monitor (which uses a DVI adapter)
 Today it hasn't crash once so far, I have plugged back in the usb devices but not the second monitor.
 I kinda suspect on the SSD because windows is installed in it, it's also a drive I bought back in 2019, and it's a 256gb drive with over 30TB of writes according to crystal disk info, but it also says that it's in good health. The drive also has tons of hours since I usually let the PC on 24/7.
 Now, should I replace this drive nonetheless? Could the problem really be the DVI adapter? (I ran into problems with it before but it had been working for months until yesterday)
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel as though I'm going insane. For the life of me, I cannot track down the cause of why this is happening. 
 A website I host https://semdeck.com (for reasons I cannot figure out) is showing two forward slashes at the end of it so it appears as semdeck.com//
 I've set it up the same as every other website I've ever built. Here is part of the .htaccess file:
  
# Always use https for secure connections 
 # Replace 'www.example.com' with your domain name 
 # (as it appears on your SSL certificate) 
 RewriteEngine On 
 RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
 RewriteRule ^(.\)$ https://semdeck.com//$1 [R=301,L]* 
 <IfModule mod\_rewrite.c> 
 RewriteBase / 
 # rule 1: remove multiple leading slashes (directly after the TLD) 
 RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \s/{2,} 
 RewriteRule (.\) $1 [R=301,L]* 
 # rule 2: remove multiple slashes in the requested path 
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.\)/{2,}(.*)$* 
 RewriteRule (.\) %1/%2 [R=301,L]* 
 </IfModule>
  
And the functions.php file contains the following:
  
/\** 
 \ Define Constants* 
 \/* 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_VERSION', '3.9.2' ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_SETTINGS', 'astra-settings' ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_DIR', trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_URI', trailingslashit( esc_url( get_template_directory_uri() ) ) );
  
I thought that both of those are signaling that there should only be one "/" at the end of the domain but I guess not. Either way, I am completely out of guesses as to why this is happening. Perhaps a plugin conflict? I've gone into Yoast SEO and even modded the canonical URL for the homepage to no avail.
 Anyone have any idea what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some context:
 I work for a computer refurbishing/resale shop. We operate mostly through online sales and handle hundreds of laptops and desktops a month. I typically am responsible for refurbishing and repairing units for resale.
 We set up a WDS server just running on a local network (not connected publicly) using an old netgear router for handling DHCP to quickly load units. The WDS is configured properly and works , as long as the images are good.
 The issue I run into is sometimes is dism doesnt pull a good image from a unit, and breaks the WDS (Shows no available images if a bad image is present) . It took me a solid 3 weeks to figure out what was going on, but eventually came to the conclusion that if I delete the bad image from the server, then the WDS continues working properly.
 ​
 My question is this,
 Why are some images bad? and how can I fix it? 85% of images I make work flawlessly, while some simply refuse to make a working image. 
 Steps taken so far:
 Most recently we got some Dell 7460 AIO's in, around 40 of them. I created an image as I always do, and loaded it on to the server. The issue occurred so I deleted the image and used a different unit to make an image, still no dice. I then tried using dism healthcheck and repair commands, dism sees nothing wrong with the image. I tried using compression on the image to see if that would make a difference. The image is Windows 11 Pro, and the Dell Optiplex 7460 is fully updated. I also tried making a Windows 10 image and that did not work either.
 I'm not sure if there is a correlation but here are some of the other models I cant get a working image for:
 Lenovo T540P
 Dell Latitude 5491
 Lenovo T460
 ​
 I cant understand why the WDS will simply reject some models. I'm hoping someone has some insight.
 ​
 Disclaimer: Ive only been studying and experimenting with networking stuff for the last year, so if there is information missing please feel free to ask. I apologize for my ignorance.

There’s still remnants of the old layer 2 192.168.x.x around and the ultimate goal is to get rid of it completely but that is going to be a rather complex and lengthy process due to VPN tunnels and a bunch of other things. 
 What I need to figure out is how to get that 192.168.x.x network on to the new side of the network. I need to migrate VMs that are on the 192 side over to new hardware that lives on the other side of the firewall. It is both physically and logically separated other than the firewall that has an interface for each side. New fiber and cables have been ran for the new side of the network. The image below shows an example of how the network is designed and what I’m trying to accomplish. I thought about changing vlan tags and tagging everything on the new side and trying an untagged vlan for the 192 but I’m needing some help and ideas.

 Does anyone have a good example of naming conventions for fixing the "employee type" problem? We have all the data/okta to solve this. Its mostly just doing a better job this time.
 "management" has proposed:
  
all@ for full/contingent workers
 all-extended@ for everyone human(no service accounts)
 contractors@ for contractors
  
This scenario would be CFO sending out internal financials, wants to not send to contractors.
 I personally hate all-extended. It reeks of all-except-some, and global-not-sales vibes.

But, few admins run the scripts (which are downloaded from the internet) directly in the production domain. It's not good to run any scripts directly to the production. 
 Admins can maintain the Office 365 test lab without an additional cost through Microsoft 365 Developer Program. You can use the test tenant for years if you use it regularly. Otherwise, it would expire in 90 days. You can't retrieve data from the deleted tenant. So, If you have a budget that you can spend for your test tenant, then you better go with a business subscription.
 How do you maintain Office 365 test setups? You can share your techniques with fellow admins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greeting,
 I find my self looking for a program that a small team could use to log what work they have done so that if in the future one of the other members needs to look up information on a old project he can find it easely. 
 A little more explanation as English is my third language and the explanaion on top is a bit vague.
 Recently a senior colleague unfortanatly passed away unexpectedly and now the 3 of us that are left find our self in a bit of a pickle as we are getting questions on how to manage past systems he has set up withouth having any documentation on the process he used to set up said systems. Most of the time things are written down in Word and stored locally somewhere or backed up to the archive under vague names. 
 So this got me thinking that there should be a program out there that is on prem (since we cannot use cloud features due to security reasons) that one can get, where whe can use it as a work log that anyone of use can access and see how and what other people have done on past projects.
 P.S. I hope this is the correct subreddit for this question, if not let me know and I will delete the post (also if you know the correct subredit, I would appreciate that info).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, the past few days besides all other tasks I do. I am looking into the possibility to containerize Local Administrative Rights in Windows 10. I have found some information but they are talking about gMSA and "run as" / "give full control" to an application as domain admin.
 The situation is, that in our organisation we develop applications ourselves and to execute them administrative permissions are neccessary to update / install and/or run the application. 
 I don't want to give myself a lot of work in maintaining and continously sending an IT employee their way to authorize an installation.
 Anyone has some tips to get around this issue? Without losing security? Because I preferrably want to withdraw all admin permissions and only give them out when needed. So I am curious if sysadmins here have a creative solution for this?
 Again thanks for the help in advance!

However i have searched far and wide over the Ethernet and i could not come up with a possible implementation that already exist more because the terms "ip scheduling" provide result in different topics.
 For my current project i have a couple of devices connected over a closed network to my main server. This server is publicly reachable on another Ethernet interface. The devices are normally accessed because packages are forwarded from the server by nginx/iptables config through the server. The idea was that there is a front-end hosted on the main server where people can reserve a time slot to gain access to one of these internal devices. Then only in said time slot would the packages be forwarded and else dropped.
 ​
 It feels like i am not the first one to implement such a feature. However i have searched far and wide over the Ethernet and i could not come up with a possible implementation that already exist more because the terms "ip scheduling" and like wise search queries provide result in different topics like human resources or dhcp static ip reservation (github was full of people making there own hotel reservations systems which would often popup).
 ​
 Therefore the question if someone may now if such a system already exist? If not i could write my own with nginx or iptables something as the gatekeeper is my plan.

The main reason why I was so careless is because the sender name was very similar to one of our customers. The virus itself was bundled inside of an img file. We use sophos central email gateway with all bells and whistles enabled - including the sandbox. The mail made it through all of that, windows 11 defender (also with all bells and whistles enabled) didn't catch it either. 
 With the help of someone smarter than me we managed to gain access to the ftp server that the virus uses to upload extracted login information. Afterwards we sent an abuse notice to the hoster who immediately deleted all contents and locked the customer out. 
 We use the default sophos list for blocked attachment file types (sophos specifically recommends using it instead of making a list on your own!). I'm trying to change that to a whitelist so for example only PDF files are allowed everything else goes into quarantine. But apparently sophos central doesn't even have that option or am I blind?

 ​
 First, if this is not supposed to be posted here, you all have my sincere apologies.
 ​
 I am a web developer (don't throw stones yet ^^ ) and I come to you looking for advice.
 ​
 As a pet project, I am building an application to streamline data collection in non technical teams.
 It is a server based application (PHP) with a web interface so I would see it either as a cloud product or on an in house server.
 I am trying to do things the right way, and one of my next steps is to think about user authentication.
 For the basics, i made a username or email | password authentication, users stored in the database, password encrypted using bcrypt. The administrator create user accounts and generate an account specific url for account activation. Transmission of the url is the responsibility of the admin.
 To go further, I plan on implementing some SSO methods.
 My guesses are:
  
google
 openId
 microsoft AD (this one will be fun to debug, as I never understood windows server XD)
  
Finally come the question:
 If you had to sysadmin such a solution, what SSO solution would you expect to find by default ?
 (And to go further, what kind of functionnality would you expect to find out of the box ? )
 ​
 Thank you in advance :)

 I know that when the users are de-provisioned, they are moved to an OU in AD that is not synchronized by AAD-Connect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We're currently trying to secure the network even more and we'd like to setup 802.1x auth for printers to put allowed printers in the correct vlan, and unknown devices in a quarantine vlan.
 Computers are authenticated using their AD computer account, and printer don't have that.
 Certificates are also not a good solution since printers are not able to request renewal themselves... 
 I've seen posts saying "you just have to create a AD user account with the macaddress and same for the password" but no one seems to care about the fact that this is a huge security issue.
 The only thing I found was to create a "Connection Request Policy" for each MAC and put them above every other regular policies.
 Conditions are :
 - Calling station ID = mac address
 - NAS Port Type = Ethernet
 Settings :
 - Authentication : Accept users without validating credentials
 It does not have to be 100% secure but at least prevent users from connecting untrusted devices like some 3rd party contractor who comes for the day and needs "internet"... but I'm still looking for ideas or a better way to do it.
 Thanks in advance :)

 https://imgur.com/a/nrG2JcM for a basic network diagram
 Had an issue where *out of nowhere, after years of this setup* the Cisco ASA got flooded with 169.254 addresses and killed the network. 
 I know what you're thinking - why the f*** do you have such cheap dumb ass unmanaged networking equipment for a 30 user environment? Because we're cheap and stupid and have no money. Believe me I've tried. I don't want to go any further into my thoughts in case of this post being found to be honest, but it is not a favourable position I am in.
 Anyways,
 I figured there was maybe a network loop happening, with this being just as the office was closing I got everyone to leave and I powered everything off. I determined that 1 small switch with 2 computers hanging off it was tripping the network when powered back on. The other switches/computers were repowered and are OK.
 The 2 computers appear fine, like I have pretty detailed software inventories using our endpoint protection agent, and indeed plugging the laptops in elsewhere, no issue.
 This is where I am out of diagnosis, knowledge, experience and wit. So I guess I can blame the switch being worth about $10, but why would it be spamming 169.254 addresses?
 I have now plugged the "faulty" switch in elsewhere and it no longer trips the network. Has this been a red herring all along?
 Moral of story is - we need better equipment so I can actually see which ports/devices these addresses were coming from. But I am still in the sad situation where I cannot properly explain the outage, so hoping for ideas.
 ***Disclaimer. I bring this post with great humility, regret and pleading forgiveness. Yes, it is barely an amateur setup for a business turning over millions of $. Just trying to get by.

 Checking the event viewer in the GroupPolicy log, for every client side extension I see an entry like the following:

 In the system log I find one entry:
 The Group Policy settings for the user were processed successfully. New settings from 0 Group Policy objects were detected and applied.
 Both log sources indicate that all user GPOs vanished from the client. gpresult shows for the user details under "Organizational Unit" that I am in a OU where inheritance is blocked and no GPO applies. However, this is not the case. My user is in the right OU!
 When I manually run a gpupdate /force everything goes back to normal. Nothing else was changed, indicating that it should have worked the whole time.

 Since SPMT didnt give me any sort of errors, and telling me that no files was skipped, i belived that everything was in perfect order.
 However, i can see that it is far from in perfect order. Lots of files and folders is missing. And it seems random which files is missing and which dont. There is no difference in rights on the folders, where files is missing, and there are no obvious reason to why the files are missing.
 Running an incremental task with SPMT makes no difference, it wont acknowledge that there are files it doesn't sync up.
 Its quite a large filedrive. My original plan was to sync everything with OneDrive to a temp location on a fileserver, and then have something like FreeFileSync to compare files and sync the missing files. But is not a viable way since OneDrive taking a really long time to get something in sync, and i dont really believe that it can handle all that data, because its also freezing up on me.
 ​
 TLDR;
 So im looking for some tool, not SPMT, since experience, that can compare my files on the fileserver to a Sharepoint site and sync the missing files. Preferably free.
 Ideas?

I asked the tech about removing the 3-way splitter in place, wondering if it had degraded and possibly causing issues. The tech tested the signals with an expensive looking tool and determined the signals coming in were good. At one point, he did indicate we could remove the splitter without issue. But, them he tested it again before proceeding and noticed an issue. 
 The way the tech explained it was if we remove the splitter, we would gain 5dB somewhere, but then lose 5dB somewhere else which would push past a certain threshold that would cause sync issues. Im not even sure it was dB, but I have to assume. He wasnt great at talking smart and I wasnt great at knowing what he was talkinh about. Im not an expert in coax cable signaling and understanding readings. I have worked at an ISP in tech support and understand the basics and sync issues, but I never got trained or learned much about this. Any help is appreciated.

I've sent out a handful of applications and am having no luck so far. I've realized that there is a huge gap in knowledge and experience between tech support and sysadmin.
 I am "level 2" at my company and deal with our business products so I work with admins vs home users which has given me some understanding of what a sysadmin is, but I'm still missing a lot of what's required for a sysadmin position.
 Is a helpdesk job going to be my best option for getting into a sysadmin role? I'm hesitant to pursue helpdesk since I'll more than likely lose a noticeable amount of pay, but there is no more growth for me in tech support and I would be able to make more in the long run as a sysadmin.
 Has anyone here gone directly from tech support to sysadmin? If so, any advice on making that switch?

 I work in IT for a small insurance firm. I accidentally discovered that our website was having issues loading when troubleshooting a different problem and found some random text in german appearing on the homepage. Upon inspecting the source code there are TONS of links that point to gambling websites and other stuff involving crypto. Our insureds use the website to log into their portal which doesn’t contain any PHI but it does have PII such as addresses, phone numbers, etc.. Is it safe to assume that there are keyloggers stealing login credentials and possibly worse things going on?
 I emailed our webdev but he isn’t in the office today and hasn’t responded yet. I’m not sure what our next steps should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grumpy old IT guy, coming in hot again.
 We had a filesystem migration to a new server this weekend. Figured there would be a few hiccups, given how thorough (/s) our testing team was. Sure enough got a P1 ticket that they are unable to process files from a system this morning. Turns out they were using sftp to push files up to the old server for one of the data flows.
 So, easy enough fix. Once I was sucked into the P1 group call this morning, I told them exactly what needed to be done. Put in a request to get ssh access to the new server, and here is the new path to the directory. Easy peasy, just like I sent out last week.
 Cut to 6 hours later. The call now has over 20 people on it, including management. They are dissecting all the data flow diagrams, and just ruled out the application server as the issue about an hour ago. Two managers asked me to rejoin the call, and before they could even 'recap' everything they've done so far, I pasted a screenshot of what I told them needed to be done from 6 hours ago, and got dead silence.
 Seems one of the offshore managers (yes, this is ALL coming from our offshore "support partner"), stepped in at the end of the call this morning to manage the issue. They are supposedly working on the access requests now and will let me know. In other news, now management wants me to write up an RCA as to the problem, and corrective instructions. Sure, no one read my emails over the last couple weeks warning of this change, they ignored my instructions for the fix this morning, and the still don't seem to fathom what they did wrong. That about covers it.

We're running out of IP addresses on the /23 network, would it be okay to increase the network to a /22 without causing broadcast issues or, is a /22 too large of a broadcast domain?
 Normally I would just create a additional subnet/ VLAN however, creating a second network/ VLAN wouldn't be ideal as ideally we need a single SSID.
 We use DHCP exclusively on this subnet with no static addresses - would it be a good idea to increase the network to a /22 but only increase our DHCP scope to 6-700 IP addresses to limit the size of the broadcast domain as much as possible?

Then the question would be whether to replace it with, well, nothing (i.e let them use browsers) or instead deploy Foxit or PDF-Xchange or whatever.
 Anyone ever covered anything like that?
 ADDENDUM: I don't mean Adobe Acrobat. Just Reader. Acrobat certainly has its vulnerabilities too but a hugely smaller foothold in the fleet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 We are currently using EAP-TLS with Computer Certificates to authenticate corporate assets before granting them access to our network using EAP-TLS. We have recently been discussing whether to extend this to the chaining of both Machine and User authentication.
 We are currently discussing whether to perform the User Authentication using PEAP (EAP-MSCHAPV2) or EAP-TLS with a User Certificate. 
 For Machine Auth I would always use Certificates rather than PEAP, but is it just as easy to manage user certificates? And are there any security concerns? From a Machine Auth perspective, the user has no business touching the certificate unless they have local administrator rights on the PC (And they don't).
 In this case, the Certificate will be issued to the User itself, so what kind of access do they get to the certificate? Will they be able to possibly export it with a few tweaks even though we issue it as 'non-exportable' from a PKI perspective? The fact that they have just the slightest access to the certificate itself, makes me wonder if it would be best to stick with PEAP for User Auth and keep Certificate Based Auth for the Machine only.

I spotted a PowerEdge R740 Server at a company that recently did a partial hardware refresh. They have 5x 3.84 TB SAS SSD's in this server, which seems a bit unusual to me. I would have expected to see an even number of drives for SSD's, not an odd number. I thought RAID5 shouldn't be used with SSD's? A single boot drive doesn't seem like a good idea (plus 3.84 TB is a lot for a boot drive). I suppose one could be a hot spare since they don't have on-site IT Staff, nor do they have an MSP. Their IT Department is at their main office hundreds of miles away and they fly in as-needed. 
 Anyway, just curious as to why there would be a 5x 3.84TB SAS SSD Setup?

 This specific use case is printing AP bills and reports, all black and white, medium volume. A few hundred pages once or twice a week. ethernet connection is preferred in our environment. 500-700 range preferred price. As far as size goes the 401n fits perfectly on his desk.

The full conversation is [here](https://community.netdata.cloud/t/critical-mdstat-disks-alert-on-4-bay-synology-nas-with-3-drives-shr1/3387). What do you think? Is it ok for mdstat to be showing a failed disk that's just not there and will never be there?

 So, 5 for 5 on customers that after turning on exchange archiving, that archive is not visible within their Outlook Desktop application unless I create a new mail profile. 
 Is it possible to get the In-Place archiving from exchange to show up without creating a new mail profile?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I am a developer and manage a few IIS servers serving mostly ASP.net classic and core web applications. I am bombarded by probing hits to various attacks. Like someone incessantly hitting /xmlrpc.php or /wordpress/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml, neither which are a feature supported on the server. They are mostly Asia or RIPE hits. I cannot do geo blocking as I do allow access to many of these countries. 
 I use a product called RDPguard that intercepts attempts to RDP, FTP and other services and bans IPs via Windows firewall for n hours when they fail out. I am wondering, is there a means via a module or small addin to do something like this but only for IIS 403/404 requests that fail? One IP has hit that wordpress URL 80 times before failing out, only to try again an hour later. Obviously I added their IP to a deny list but they will just come back on another stolen IP or proxy later.
 I realize I can use IIS to deny patterns, but the 404 handler is doing that already. I want to block that IP if possible on the 10'th time for 4 hours. 
 Ideally I would set up 10 or so common strings I am seeing in logs. Some are even just basic SQL injection phrases, like a select * in the query string. I don't want to implement a full IPS just yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Afternoon all
 ​
 I have under my care a Windows Server 2019 Standard, V1809, OS Build 17763.3532
 It's main purpose is Backup
 It Runs Veeam Backup and Replication.
 ​
 It is Directly connected to a cluster of ISCSI Switches. a 10GB connection into either one and setup with Nic Teaming for the two 10GB Nic's
 We have also tried this with just the singular 10gb with no Teaming and experience the same issues.
 ​
 Now onto my issue
 ​
 Randomly we have a major ISCSI failure which results in a total network loss which results in failed backups.
 I have attempted to get support from Veeam But as far as they are concerned its an infrastructure issue and not their problem to deal with.
 ​
 ​
 Now onto my issue
 It all starts with an error IScsiPrt Error 20 in eventviewer
 then we get in mixed order Event ID - 129,9,39,27,63,43,10
 ​
 In Eventviewer i see those Event ID's in no particular order and often 9 repeats a few times in a row.
 what this represents physically is a total network loss 
 ​
 After a few Hrs systems seem to stabilise the errors stop and the network re-establishes
 and backup pick up where they left off.
 ​
 We do eventually have successful backups
 ​
 This issue occurs at what appears to be random to me (i cannot find a solid item to pinpoint the start of this issue from)
 I am at the end of my tether, have attempted every fix i could find, including registry edits and as men=tioned above adding a secondary 10Gb Nic.
 ​
 But the issue keeps re-occuring
 Please help

 I ask you if you know of any other operators that allow you to view the statistics of your network, such as WeatherMap or traffic graphs on the backbones.
 An example is OVH, which displays its backbones and relative "load" percentages at this address: http://weathermap.ovh.net/#europe
 Another example is the GARR network which allows you to view more data than the previous one, also including graphs of aggregate traffic on the links.
 Also Nerim (France ISP) if you click on "Accès Invité" its share own graphs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping to get a second set of eyes to make sure I'm not overlooking something obvious on this one (likely). I did reach out to my vendor, but they weren't really much help.
 ​
 A user of mine appears to have had their mailbox compromised. It was then used to communicate with their accountant to request etransfers be made. The email itself was very poorly crafted and shouldn't have fooled a 6 year old, and it was even filtered to spam. My concern though is making sure I'm reading the logs correctly and making sure any security holes I stupidly left open get closed, so it doesn't happen again.
 ​
 The mailbox had a randomized password with enforced MFA and no app passwords in use. These measures were in place before the supposed compromise happened.
 There are no secondary SPF records that would be allowing sending from another source (website, mail service, etc).
 If I do a message trace on the sender's mailbox, the message shows up. The sending mail server is a godaddy address.
 There are no send connectors, custom user mailbox rules, etc in place and I've confirmed there's no delegate/send as access for the account.
 ​
 ​
 TLDR: I'm positive I'm overlooking something basic here. Would I just be sleepily misreading the logs and it's a junk spoofing attempt which is why it would have initially been filtered in spam? I haven't dug into 365 logs much in the past but had assumed unauthenticated mail wouldn't be showing in a user's message trace.

 Hope y'all are having a nice Monday so far.
 ​
 Question.... I am currently implementing a new Client Authentication template that will be configured to use Autoenrollment in order to get deployed to client machines.
 ​
 This new template in question, I have also decided to configure Template Supersedence. I have added 2-3 templates that I want this certificate to supersede. 
 ​
 After logging into a test machine that has older certificates deployed in it's store, I do receive the new template and it also removes the older certificate as is expected with the supersedence.
 ​
 Now, here comes the million dollar question. If my machine was provisoned using Autopilot and this process installs a certificate using SCEP, would this certificate also get removed from the machine if the template is configured as a superseded template?
 ​
 Reason I am asking is that this scep certificate doesn't seem to be removed when I log on to the machine. I'm wondering why. The only difference with other certificates was the method by which it was deployed (Configuration Profile instead of Autoenrollment through group policy).

 Apparently, it's been happening since last week, but not many users complained. When we investigated this issue today, we found several other users have the same issue, and they all had KB5018410 installed, and those that didn't have this issue didn't have the update installed. We uninstalled this update from the affected machines, and everything started working again!
 We do use RDS Farm with UDP, so not sure if it's related.

 It offers my two options
  
 X20 LTE-A (DW5821e) with eSIM
  X20 LTE-A (DW5821e) without eSIM
  
They are both the same price.
 Why would I choose the "without eSIM" variant? Does the "with eSIM" variant no support regular SIMs as well?
 To add confusion, I have found DW5821e chips only that mention "eSIM only". I can't imagine this is true but still... very confusing

 I can narrow down our list of suspects by running Wireshark captures while correlating local ports to process IDs with TCPview, which is fine on my own machines, but not really feasible with impacted clients who we're pulling out of their production work to run test cases for us.
 The sticking point is preserving the list of PIDs and correlating to source ports. I can get the PIDs from tasklist, but that's just a single point in time. I can get the PID to local port linkage from netstat, but that's also just a single point in time. I could enable process auditing, but our Security event logs already roll over too fast to scope troubleshooting across a full day because of file auditing (Splunk is tightly controlled with a formal change process, so that's out for stretching the log storage in any kind of timely fashion).
 I'm aware I may be able to catch this in ETL format, but my ETW game is weak and limited to: pktmon capture > pktmon etl2pcap > read in Wireshark; I have no experience at all with collecting app data in ETL.
 At the end of the day, I'm just looking for a single tool I can run that can get me these four fields for diagnostic purposes:
  
<PID>
 <Process Name>
 <Source IP>:<Source Port>
 <Destination IP>:<Destination Port>

 There are a plethora of snippet manager apps for developers, with syntax highlighting, etc, available for macOS, eg: - SnipperApp - Snip - massCode - SnippetsLab - Quiver
 ...and so on. 
 Some of those are free, some are one time payment, and some are subscription. Some are simple, some more elaborate, but all of the ones above are really designed for Developers - the syntax highlighting supports only programming and scripting languages, really. 
 I was wondering if any of you guys who are network engineers and also mac users have an app that would serve well as a snippet manager with syntax highlighting for Cisco, Juniper and other network config formats? 
 I'm currently using MacVim with vim-wiki plugin, and it works reasonably well, but I would like something with a bit more structure, where I can more easily search through and look for notes / config snippets.

I'm not confortable with this setup, but perhaps it's just me;
 I wonder if there's a downside in using many disks vs growing an existing one and modifying the partition table. Apparently the volume overhead is minimal, so it shouldn't be an issue. What do you think?

 Afaik there should be a more easier way then this? (e.g. ask for their static IP at the very least and they can use their in-house email server to send emails to/from)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm working with a vendor and they have their SMTP system where they input the normal settings for SMTP. It keeps failing in their system (Says check credentials, even though I'm 100% sure it's not the credentials), I thought it was their system because when I use the website below, it works fine and sends me an email using the SMTP information I provide. Also, we use SMTP for scan to email on printers for this same account which also works fine. So I know for a fact SMTP is working correctly for this account that we are testing.
 https://dnschecker.org/smtp-test-tool.php
 Settings used:
 SMTP SERVER: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Email From: Scanner@G**********.com
 Email to: (Myself)
 Use Secured Connection enabled
 Use Authentication enabled
 username: Scanner@G**********.com
 Password: (Scanner's Password)
 Outcome: Success
 ​
 However, I just checked a different tool, using the exact same settings and it's failing on the below website that requires the exact same information.
 https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test
 Settings used:
 SMTP SERVER: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Email From: Scanner@G**********.com
 Email to: (Myself)
 Use Secured Connection enabled
 Use Authentication enabled
 username: Scanner@G**********.com
 Password: (Scanner's Password)
 Outcome: Failed
 ​
 Anyone know why SMTP would work for somethings but not others? I would expect as long as it's using the same Port. server, security and username information it would work if it's working for other SMTP tools.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 we are a medium sized dev company. As of today, any application is developed in our own tenant. Devs are able to register new apps, grant (most) delegated permissions and start hacking away (loosely speaking).
 There are a couple of issues I see with that approach:
  
Apps grant permissions to production data.
 Bugs or misuse can lead to data loss.
 App credential stealing can lead to data loss and leaks.
 Registering enterprise apps can lead to data leaks.
  
For that reason, I'd wish that development is out-sourced to a non-production tenant. Or better: Each project gets their own tenant. We have a couple of dozen parallel projects and this could prevent teams getting in each others way - even if that would be only by accident.
 There are currently two ways I can imagine how this works:
  
For every new project, a standalone tenant must be registered. If licenses are needed, they must buy-in. Ideally, this is managed completely separate from IT e.g., by the project manager or a designated tenant-owner. They manage the tenant registration, credit-card info and payments, licensing. We have a devops-department, maybe also they could take over dev-tenant management company-wide.
 For every new project, a M365 developer subscription sandbox is registered. The upside to this is that it is batteries-included with licensing and sample data in most used areas like EXO and SP. The downside is that this tenant is linked to a person in the company, who may leave the company at any point in time. (Now that I think of it, we could use service accounts to have this not linked to real people.)
  
I imagine that this tenant should not be managed by IT at all. The project members are responsible for security, compliance and data privacy.
 How are you guys managing this kind of stuff? Are there other solutions I have not thought of yet?

Neither he nor I have tons of experience. Today a server rebooted and when it came up again the SQL server was down due to expired evaluation as I found out, when reviewing the logs.
 Turns out the reason for not having a license was that it was too expensive for us, but as long as the DB was >10GB it shouldn't be a problem I was told, but tuns out that only applies if you use the express version. We only need this particular server for 1.5 months more before it will be taken down anyway.
 Is it possible to migrate the db from the standard edition to the express? I also read an article saying that I can turn back the clock on the server, but I fear that may lead to complications with other systems, though that would be an easy solution given we only need it for 6 more weeks.
 I am frankly a little out of my depth here. I'm good at figuring stuff out by furiously googling and never giving up and I have worked as a junior sysadmin for two years and have been dabbling with homelabs etc for many years. I'm decent with networking and Linux, but I have not worked much at all with SQL, especially not MS SQL. 
 Could I buy a license for just two months perhaps? Please help, this is a production system.
 What should I do?

 We are looking for electronic document signing solutions, we need to cover two scenarios:
  
About 30 people work with external entities - NDAs, quality certificates etc. Very low frequency of use, one or two per user per month. Something similar to DocuSign. 
 
About 150 people internal use only - to establish formal traceability in various internal process documents. High frequency of use, up to several dozen per day.
 
 DocuSign and other similar products rack up costs exceedingly fast.
 Can anyone suggest more economical solutions? We can live with two different products for external and internal use if there is a cost benefit.

Our contracted network engineer has refused to have a Linux VM or an Internal CA on our network to make this project work according to any documentation I find online.
 He has provided me with a third-party wildcard certificate for our domain and has set up a Windows Server 2016 for me to use for the project. Is there any way for me to specify the wildcard certificate in the CaddyFile to be used for each reverse proxy without needing to declare a DNS challenge as according to the documentation. I currently have it creating local certificates with Caddy's internal CA but it will still give a warning to end users and most will not know how to allow exceptions.
 As I am new to using Caddy and failed miserably trying to set up a reverse proxy through IIS any suggestions would be appreciated.

 Depending on my sleep or coffee levels, it's either amusing or infuriating the sort of things I see because DMARC. I'll ignore everything else for now, this is just DMARC.
 Common, daily occurrences include:
  
Sending DMARC reports for received DMARC reports
 Receiving a "mailbox full" error for dmarc@some-idiot.com
 Receiving a "message rejected by spam filter" because the message attachment contains blacklisted IPs. Huh I wonder why those are there
 Receiving a "mailbox does not exist" error, because reasons.
  
And my new, personal favorite: 
 "INEPT-COMPANY Request received - Report Domain: inept-company.com Submitter: dmarc-sender.com Report-ID: inept-company.com.1665896400.1665982800"
 That's right, their DMARC address is listed as support@ which is their Zendesk address. So any DMARC reports sent are going to end up automatically creating a ticket!
 I don't know what's worse, their ineptitude at understanding how to setup a mailbox to take a set of messages every day, or how their support team feels dealing with the daily ticket influx of a completely automated and unactionable message.

 I figured it might be the cert (somehow), so I tried adding our wildcard cert to the RD Gateway instead. Sure enough, same error. Put the original rds.domain .com cert back in, it works.
 I found various articles suggesting setting EnforceChannelBinding to 0 (via regedit) on the RDG server, which out of curiosity I've done - no difference. I also set LMCompatibilityLevel on my PC to 3, no good. No other posts I've found so far that have to do with that error code have much else info i'm afraid.
 Has anyone else ever seen a new SSL cert cause users to fail logging in? Or does anyone have any ideas where to start looking? Nothing has changed server-side other than the cert, and besides - you'd think if it had, the old cert would have broken... Thanks in advance!
 ​
 EDIT: The only thing different from the last time is that there's a new firewall in that does HTTPS inspection (or something along those lines, it's managed by a 3rd-party). I'm reaching out to them, in case it's the difference in SSL certs causing this, but does that sound likely to anyone else? (i'm fairly new to HTTPS inspection sorry)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've got a branch office that was previously sending Internet traffic to the ISP and local office subnet over an IPsec tunnel w/ bgp. The plan now is to send local subnet traffic AND all internet traffic over this tunnel (in this case, the other end is Prisma cloud, but scenario should be the same if it was the HQ) This is my first time sending all traffic over the tunnel, so the routing intricacies escape me a bit. 
 https://imgur.com/a/jYJZweo A scribble diagram to help visualize and give better detail.
 ​
 So initially, changing the next hop for 0.0.0.0/0 to Tunnel.1 would bring the office completely down. My understanding now is that it's basically trying to send the IKE and ESP traffic etc over a tunnel that doesn't exist yet.
 ​
 So I've done a little bit of research and it sound like I have to have a static route that goes to the ISP still, but at a lower priority:
 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop eth1.4 172.0.0.2 (isp) Priority 15
 for the IKE/ESP traffic for tunnel creation.
 ​
 Then have another route for all other traffic (local subnet and Internet) with a higher priority, so local office traffic flows as before and so Internet traffic can pass to Prisma/HQ for inspection.
 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop tunnel.1 Priority 10
 ​
 The tunnel traffic is also using BGP, the traffic to the ISP is not.
 ​
 Any insight and/or corrections welcome! Thank you all in advance!

 I'm in the process of deploying a new 2-tier PKI so will consist of a Root CA and subordinate CA. I've done plenty of research around recommended validity periods for Root CA and subordinate CA - however I've recently read up on the Y2038 bug.
 The idea was to deploy the new Root CA with a validity period of 20 years and then the subordinate for half of that period however this will take the expiry date past the year 2038 - I'm just curious how is everyone else dealing with this bug - are you deploying CA certificate with a date prior to this date?
 Reading the bug it only seems to effect legacy systems that use 32bit integer for the time.
 Just curious how y'all are working around this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this to the CCNP subreddit but got no response, hope it's okay to ask here.
 I'm reading the OCG CCNP book and I'm a little confused at its explanation of how BPDU filter works when enabled globally. Here's what it says:
 "The global BPDU filter configuration uses the command spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default, and the port sends a series of 10 to 12 BPDUs. If the switch receives any BPDUs, it checks to identify which switch is more preferred.
 ■ The preferred switch does not process any BPDUs that it receives, but it still transmits BPDUs to inferior downstream switches.
 ■ A switch that is not the preferred switch processes BPDUs that are received, but it does not transmit BPDUs to the superior upstream switch"
 My understanding is that when BPDU filter is configured globally it applies to all portfast ports and if a port receives a BPDU it converts to a regular STP port. Applied at the interface and it basically stops the port from participating in STP. 
 I feel like it's just explaining regular STP operation but I'm confused by the wording.

Currently the network utilizes Auto QoS at the access switch level for the end users. It is recommended to mark the traffic DSCP AF41. I am not sure if Auto QoS will mark this traffic appropriately or if I need to create a custom class-map/policy-map. I need some clarification on this statement in the 9300 documentation
 " After auto-QoS is enabled, do not modify a policy map or aggregate policer that includes AutoQoS in its name. If you need to modify the policy map or aggregate policer, make a copy of it, and change the copied policy map or policer. To use the new policy map instead of the generated one, remove the generated policy map from the interface, and apply the new policy map. " - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9500/software/release/17-3/command_reference/b_173_9500_cr/qos_commands.htm
 So is this saying copy the Auto QoS policy and create a duplicate with my custom class-maps then disable Auto QoS and apply to the interface?
 I am very weak in this area, any help is much appreciative.

 we are a fairly large organization with a couple of small offices around the world.
 For example we have an office in Tokyo with approx a dozen users. We have a small vSphere platform there which we want to dismantle and go serverless. We have already two EC2 DCs in the AWS Frankfurt region (they are an extention of our on-prem AD).
 Something I'm wondering, we also have offices in Singapore, Manila, Seoul and a few more in the region. So I believe it may make sense to use a single region (Singapore ?) to serve all these regions ?
 I'm curious as to what kind of best practice analysis and implementation (if one exists) I should follow for this kind of implementation. Has anyone gone through this before ? Just trying to see if there is a known practice I should follow.
 Thanks in advance!

The connection once works and once does not work. I was able to determine that the public FQDN resolves to a lot of public IPs from different subnets. The ASA does not always have the IP address in the DNS cache to which the FQDN on the server was resolved. Server and the ASA have exactly the same DNS server set up. Unfortunately, I am unable to obtain a complete list of the IP addresses of the subnets to which the FQDN is resolved, so traffic needs to be filtered to FQDN. I have noticed that the FQDN on the server changes every 30-40 seconds or so, and on the ASA in the DNS cache I see a TTL for the FQDN of up to 2 minutes. Does anyone have any idea how to solve this so that in the DNS cache on the ASA the FQDN address is always the same as on the server? I know that the server first resolves the FQDN and then with the IP address it gets from DNS it goes to ASA. The ASA must have there the IP address to which the FQDN on the server was resolved.

 I’ve noticed with my work Dell, that when under heavy load, it drains from the battery as well as the mains. At first I thought there was something wrong with it, but apparently this is normal for modern laptops and makes sense as it saves on money for the manufacturer as they can use a weaker power supply and regulators. 
 In addition, I’ve noticed that if the battery dies completely, the laptop won’t switch back on for five or so minutes until the battery has charged a bit even though the power cable is plugged in - just like a flat phone…
 So is the battery now essential? I’m asking partly because I wonder what will happen to certain laptops in a few years once the battery is fully aged and useless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working with some network automation over the last while at my organization. The senior tech's haven't enabled HTTP on any of the network appliances because as far as they're concerned, it simply expands the attack surface to yet another port on the device when SSH, NETCONF, and SNMP are open. 
 I've been working with Python and Ansible to script some automated actions and generate reports for certain bits of data, but now I'm genuinely curious. 
 Ansible has the ability to utilize either netconf (XML via SSH), restapi (HTTP API), or network_cli (CLI via SSH) for its connection method to the devices. In the same vein, I can use Netmiko (CLI via SSH) or NAPALM (HTTP API) when using Python/Nornir.
 Our monitoring tools make extensive use of SNMP. This includes DNAC pushing downstream changes. 
 Q: What are the immediate benefits to enabling HTTP within the direct scope of network automation and API usage? Can it be reasonably boiled down to "aimlessly expanding the attack surface", or is there tangible benefit that I'm not seeing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing some weekend work for a second school district and I've been getting complaints about staff not being able to pull up certain videos falling under restricted. I have the staff OU set to be able to verify and approve restricted content and in chrome device policies I have restricted mode disabled for the staff OU as well.
 It works fine in Edge and when I pull the policies JSON it seems to be flagged as a machine policy override, but I can't seem to find a toggle for it, assuming it's some Chrome browser specific setting but I'm not finding anything under Chrome device policies.
  "ForceYouTubeRestrict": { "conflicts": [ { "level": "mandatory", "scope": "user", "source": "cloud", "value": 0 } ], "level": "mandatory", "scope": "machine", "source": "cloud", "value": 2, "warning": "This policy is working as intended but a conflicting value is set elsewhere and is overridden by this policy." }, 
 Any ideas?
 Edit: From what I can see it's doing at the level of the Chrome application as an HTTP header restriction to the individual machine/browser, going into a guest mode in the browser continues to apply the policy, and I can see the policy is being applied at the machine level in the admin console, but not where the policy is coming from...
 Edit: Changed machine policy at root level to allow, and at student level to disable, which resolved the issue. For some reason it was prioritizing/inheriting the root level machine policy instead of overriding it.

 Has anyone used the Cat8000 as an LNS? Are there any restrictions or caveats
 The router should be integrated as MPLS Edge with IS-IS, MPLS-SR and L3VPN. From the licensing point of view the Network Advantage stack gives all this. Has anyone already gathered experience with this?
 Up to now i never implemented a C8k as plain IOS-XE device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I describe the problem everyone will probably be happy to know that I've already told them to change the hostname of Device B and to never talk to be about this again. But I have a bug up my butt because I should be able to detect where this is coming from, but so far I can't.
 My company writes custom applications that create custom problems. Today's problem is that something is creating dynamic DNS entries on our DNS server on behalf of another device, and the DNS entry it is creating has an IP that conflicts with another device on the network.
 Device A is a Windows 10 PC with IP 192.168.1.100 and hostname Device-A. Device B is some embedded device with IP 192.168.1.200 and hostname Device-A. That's right, duplicate hostname. So the DNS entry for Device A gets over-written with the 192.168.1.200 address and then they can't reach Device A on the network.
 The problem is that it isn't Device B that is creating the entries on the DNS server. We turned Device B off for 24 hours and something still was creating the DNS entry, but I can't find what is doing that. I've run Wireshark captures, Microsoft Network Monitor captures, ProcMon captures, and checked the DNS-Server Audit log in Event Viewer. I can see plenty of entries of Active Directory dynamic updates, arp/LLMNR/NBNS/MDNS queries and responses, SMB advertisements, but none of them are for Device B that I'm looking for. 
 Clearly the problem is that I don't have a deep enough understanding of the mechanisms behind this behavior. So I'm hoping someone can throw some terms my way that I can Google and read up on. Or some articles that describe what's going on. I've been doing some Google searches but I'm only finding generic articles/tutorials that don't give any insight into what I'm looking for.
 Thanks in advance for any info you can send my way!
 Edit: Both devices have static IPs configured, no DHCP is involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 TL;DR: What are the real MFA triggers for Azure Security Defaults? Is it sufficient for SMB?
 Ages ago I read up on Azure security defaults (link on bottom), and it appeared to only register users for authentication methods, but it did not enforce MFA use for users, instead only admins. 
 Shortly after the announcement - it appeared that they added a "smart tracking" (per se) that would have users use MGA when it is necessary. 
 With that in mind, does anyone know the exact rules to when users will need to reauthenticate?
 Is this sufficient for SMBs (less than 30 users), or should I use per-user MFA/force upgrades to licensing for Conditional Access?
 I understand that there are many factors, but I would like to understand more in depth. Through testing, I have confirmed that new IPs trigger MFA, but I want to be sure that after some time it get's triggered again.

 Two Domain Controllers. Both 2016, say A and B. B is relatively new.
 Using our VPN appliance and AD authentication, if the VPN connects to A, it will allow users on, it will allow the users connect and read the users group membership.
 If A is down and B is up, the VPN will connect to B but return wrong credentials for the user 
 There's no error messages in DCdiag for both. Repadmin is fine.
 I can setup a user in AD, shut down DC A and can log the brand new user onto a new laptop and it will show their logon server is B.
 I have a ticket with the VPN vendor, but still feel something must be up with B. Just can't think of any troubleshooting. Any ideas? Or any way to test the user with flow or get logs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm building an AD tiered access model and using the "Deny logon on..." User Rights Assignment GPO's. However most guides talk about how you need to include all the users of the other tiers in the deny policy. For instance for the T0 GPO you need to deny T1 and T2 users.
 However, I wanted to reverse this logic. I would like to deny access to ALL users and exclude the current tier users only. Tried doing this by denying all authenticated users and changing the GPO's permission of "Apply group policy" to deny the GPO being applied to the T0 users. But, since the GPO is a computer policy it won't do much to deny users from the GPO. 
 Is there another way to handle this logic of having denied logon access to everyone except some group?

 What are the tools you must have with you at all times? I am pretty nomadic with my IT tool-set. I typically have my laptop backpack that contains all sorts of items. Some to share are:
 iFixIt screw drivers, rechargeable battery pack, Ethernet cables, HDMI cable, USB-C Hub with Ethernet adapter, USB drives. I have some other cables too and carry an inverter in my car.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked by my new job to implement some power apps governance.
 It looks like its been halfway setup 
 -we have a CoE environment
 -microsoft Flow is under the solutions
 -we have a service account as the creator of half the flows (other flows are the ex-employee that set it up a few months ago)
 -I cannot see any of the flows from the ex-employee, it errors out
 ​
 I do not think anything is actively running in the CoE environment. I ran an audit on the service account to see if its actually doing anything and nothing came up.
 I want to redo the entire environment, as it seems the CoE governance apps have updated since that time the user implemented it. It also was halfway finished, with some of the crucial flows belonging to the ex-employee that it used to belong to.
 ​
 That being said, has anyone ran into this or setup something similar? If I reset the password on the service account via AAD, will anything break? I need to log into it to set up our CoE environment from scratch as this current one is a mess.

 I'm just worried that I will be anxious all the time about answering my work phone when I'm home. What if I wanted to go see a movie? What if I wanted to go away for a weekend, out of state? I would be a technical specialist meaning I'm the first line of contact for issues that may arrise.

 Has anyone had any experience with them? PayG is $5.99/month with no fees on egress/API requests, and it just seems so suspiciously cheap to me. 
 I intend to backup about 100GB of 365 data via object storage, and then a backup store via a scale out repo... We'll be well under 1TB, but still, 5.99 just seems ridiculous? I'm aware that deletion of anything younger than 90 days will result in a charge; that won't be an issue..

In the short term, I would like to get an entry level job as a linux sys admin after some time spent at the NOC, the end game maybe dive into Azure.
 Although my main focus is to set my self up for success after the NOC and get a job working as a sys admin. Which of the two certs would best help me achieve this ? LPIC 1 - 3 or LFCA ?

 I run Fedora 36 on my home PC and I've setup an Alma Linux 8 VM in work that I want to use as a jumpbox to access our systems however I also want all my special keystrokes to go to that VM like the Windows Key, Alt Tab, Ctrl-Shift-Tab etc....
 The connection to the office uses OpenVPN which I keep running in a terminal on my Desktop PC.
 I was thinking that using XDMCP over ssh would be the way to go by starting X in tty2 and connecting that to the VM but also keeping tty1(my current local XFCE4 DE) available to use by jumping between the two.
 Does this sound like a good idea?My aim is to maximize the performance but also for it to be stable. 
 For reference: My Fedora install makes no use of Wayland at all, it started as the absolute minimum install and I opted for X. The reason being that I wanted to try building up the system only with packages I needed as I went along.

 I’ve seen quite a few companies in which majority of the infrastructure is hosted in AWS but are still utilizing services from Microsoft such as Intune, Office 365 suite, AD connect, etc. The companies I work with traditionally have only Windows Servers along with a few custom apps their developers manage and maintain. To me, it seems more rational to host everything in Azure instead of splitting services out between the two platforms. Any ideas on the rational here?
 Edit: I’m aware that there may be cost difference and such but from my experience, Azure and AWS seem fairly similar in regards to pricing and data center locations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A slight rant, but curious how common this is as it’s the first time it has happened to me in 22 years of software purchasing. 
 We had been using a particular piece of software for phishing simulation exercises for 4 years, but when Microsoft introduced their own version of campaigns within 365 admin centre I decided to use that, and not renew the paid product. 
 So, when the renewal hit my inbox some 2 months before the current licence term was up, I told them that I we did not wish to renew. 
 However, they insisted that we were under contract as we hadn’t given them 3 months notice to cancel. I tried speaking to the account manager and even to their legal dept, but they insisted that we pay. I tried to negotiate a smaller termination fee based on us not using it for around 18 months but they wouldn’t budge and finance eventually paid after I had it in writing that it would not auto renew next year. 
 I just found the whole experience really shitty customer service from them and would never recommend them or a company that operates the same.
 //edit. Since a few have asked. The company in question is Metacompliance

 This is maddening for me and anxiety enducing. I had three tasks in 1 hour to do, had about 10-15 each to do them. The first was to write a docker container to make a small python game work. I did it but not the exact way they wanted with the container using CMD to launch the game itself. This wasn't for lack of knowledge, this was how my mind functions, I write what feels like it should work, test, iterate, troubleshoot, test, etc. In the end it worked but I had to exec into the container to manually run it. 5 minutes longer or someone not watching me…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just going to go on a little rant here, so pardon my french, but for the love of god and all that is holy, please name your servers, your network infrastructure, hell even your datacenters something logical. 
 So far, in my travails, I have encountered naming conventions centered around:
  
Comic book characters
 Greek/Norse mythology
 Capitals
 Painters
 Biblical characters
 Musical terminology (things like "Crescendo" and "Modulation")
 Types of rock (think "Graphite" and "Gneiss")
  
This isn't the Da Vinci code, you're not adding "depth" by dropping obscure references in your environment. When my external consultant ass walks into your office, it's to help you with your problems. I'm not here to decipher three layers of bullshit to figure out what you mean by saying your Pikachu can't connect to your Charizard because Snorlax is down. Obtuse naming conventions like this cost time, focus and therefor money. I get that it adds a little flair to something sterile and "dull", but it's also actively hindering me from doing a good job. 
 Now, as a disclaimer, what you do in the privacy of your own home is not my business. If you want to name your server farm after the Bad Dragon catalog, be my guest, you're the god of your domain. But if you're setting up an environment to be maintained by a dozen or so people, you have to understand that not everyone will hear "Chance" and think "Domain Controller".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The company I'm working for is an ISP owning a small fibre network. We use GPON to rent internet accesses to private customers. As we are expanding our network we need to automate the provisioning of the devices to keep up with the workload.
 I've created a small proof of concept using netbox as a single source of truth and Ansible running on AWX as our automation controller. This is suboptimal as there is no Ansible role/collection for the Nokia ISAM FD series. Developing one would mean substantial costs in allocated engineering time.
 Before commiting to this model I'd like to know what automation concepts you folks use in your networks. Have you got multi / single vendor concepts, what software do you use, how do you handle (legacy) devices which are not supported by the automation software? Do you use monolithic or vendor specific solutions or do you use a stack of different solutions communicating by API? If possible please put the model in context of how many devices are automated, and how large the supporting team is. 
 Many thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am looking for a best bang-for-buck solution - be it refurbished or otherwise - of a server for the following uses.
 It can hold hyper-v with 3 x VM's. 
 A VM for "us" so basically a jumpbox for our techs to work from (want DC access only when absolutely necessary).
 A VM for basic file backups (to supplement our cloud solution)
 A VM for testing - so if we want to test a login before handing it out, we have a prebuilt vm to test login etc.
 That's all, and none of them have to run super speedy or anything.
 Finally, it must be low footprint, to fit into a locked cabinet. It can either be small or a rack mounted item.
 I've literally never used a mini server... so not sure what might fit these needs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have been wanting to do this for a long time, One of the things that I am really passionate about is using a data driven approach to save money on Cloud spend. The most rewarding jobs I have undertaken in the past are going into an AWS environment and saving money on cloud spend and optimising the best performance for less money! 
 It's a great value add for any organisation. 
 Alot of the organisations spend more on fancy tools to try and save money on Monthly cloud spend which I think is pointless as it often outweighs the cost of the money they try and save. Also I have seen tools that don't even check the basics. The data is already there for you in AWS and it's simply a case of extrapolating it using a bit of engineering time which you pay for anyway and the result is that you can often save more money! 
 Certainly I have seen it a lot here in Reddit, Cost is becoming ever more prevalent in many AWS environments. 
 Two things to mention, There are copies I will give away for free to those engineers who will agree to read it and implement the savings ideas in their environments and give me feedback and comments, So it would be good to see how much you saved over a month. It would be interesting to gauge feedback. 
 I have to spend a bit of time mentoring Juniors in the past so I know especially at the moment how the job market is. So I will give away free copies to Junior engineers looking for ideas how to break into the market and some handy tips to increase your chances of standing out when going to for an interview. 
 If you feel this is you, Feel free to DM me. 
 Anyway without giving too much away, I have produced a guide for it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. Good day!
 So, I was planning to take off the password on my laptop because my brother will use it so he will not call me every time. I dont know what I did but I managed to change my only account on the laptop to local guest user from administrator. Now, there are things that I cannot access becuase it says it needs the approval of admin.
 Usually there will be a prompt like, "Do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device" and it has an option of "Yes" or "No", but since there is no admin now, it only has "No".
 I'm stupid I know (lol) but i dont know what to do. hahaha. Highly appreciate it if somebody can suggest what I need to do. Thank you :)
 edit: I have the windows 11 now

 I have just done an audit of local accounts on servers and noticed a jdkadmin account on one. Appears to be a full admin on the server.
 Doing a google it could be a java account. According to logging, the jdkadmin account has been there for a few days. This server has an internal only web app on it so could be java related. Also has Firefox on it and Chrome. External access is via reverse proxy in Azure.
 As a precaution, I have changed all domain admin accounts, audited the admin usage accounts, and changed all 30-odd service accounts. Also changed the ADMINISTRATOR accounts and made sure it hasn't been used. Also revoked all VPN credentials from third-party support companies and suspended all their accounts just in case.

 We have 802.1X enabled and I’ve read that you shouldn’t use that together with MAC port-security since it may cause other issues.
 What is the best and simplest way to get rid of unmanaged switches that doesn’t talk STP?
 Might I add, we use Catalyst 9200/9300 mainly with some 2960x here and there.

We have a bios password but they may know it so we think it was rebuilt. It's a Dell if that helps.

 Hard decision has to be made -
 Should we buy $1,000 desktops + $1,000 laptops? or forget the desktops and spend the full $2,000 on laptops with docking stations and use it like a desktop with employees taking it home when needed.
 The desktop+laptop option seems enticing but having twice the equipment to keep track of, maintain, keeping track of files on two devices... could get messy, at least compared to just having the simplicity of one laptop for everyone.
 We're looking to get 5 years out of the equipment. What would your preferred set up be for work if you had the option? what makes the most sense? Are surface pros with docks worth considering?

 There are two sets of switches. 
 One set of switches has multimode transceivers with duplex multimode patch cables plugging into the fiber patch panel at each end on pair 1. 
 The other set of switches are using single mode transceivers with duplex single mode patch cables and plugged into the same patch panel using pair 2. 
 I can confirm that they are from the same cable. (6 wires that make 3 pairs). 
 Both setups work. How is that possible running over the same type of fibre? Assuming the fibre in between the patch panels is single mode, then multimode should not work or vice versa correct?
 Thanks.

Like "check if AV is working by trying to download EICAR test file" or "check if Port X,Y,Z are generally closed towards internet by trying to connect to destinations that would generally allow those ports" etc.
 I don't know if I'm googling the correct terms, as I couldn't find any good resources on this topic.
 My first idea was setting up nagios or librenms or something and just use active checks for this. Curling EICAR test file or setting up tcp checks for certain ports / destinations and stuff.
 Am I on the right track for this? Is there dedicated software for this purpose?

My problem is the ISP on my main router is pretty crappy and has outages all the time. I would like to utilize the 1GB on my 2nd router for failover. I figured there must be a way to configure the lan port on the pfsense router to be able to utilize the circuit on the main router. Any ideas on how i should proceed with this configuration? vlans, bridge mode,??? help please!

looks more Mac like and that is a positive thing 
 snap layouts are super useful
 people are actually using virtual desktops (I did bill virtual desktops as a “new feature” even though it was in windows 10) 
 the simplified interface on the surface seems more intuitive 
 the learning curve is very shallow since most conventions from 10 carried over
 new context menu missing buttons is a sticking point 
  
For the most part feedback has been positive. I haven’t received any hate for bringing things from 10 > 11, when I did receive some hatemail last time upgrading people from 7 > 10. Totally anecdotal, but thought the upgrade being relatively easy on end users was notable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have Cisco WLCs and are looking at Clearpass in our Higher Ed environment. I'm curious if anyone has these two features working with both vendors? 
  
Client network isolation based on student account for IOT devices (Clearpass AirGroups)
 Multi pre-shared key (Aruba term) or Identity pre-shared key (Cisco term)
  
It looks like Aruba can do both, if you have both Clearpass and Aruba APs. Cisco can do both with ISE and Cisco APs, but I'm having a hard time finding a documented solution with both vendors. 
 I did find this Aruba doc showing iPSK setup in Clearpass, but I'm not sure how the policy is enforced on the WLC side or if you can dynamically setup PSK's on a per account basis. 
 Thanks for the help!

She has been a great director - doesn't micromanage, tons of flexibility, plays the politics well, and buffers us from users / admin if necessary. We are a small dept. and everyone gets along. Sure there are things I would change but overall no major complaints.
 Everyone's a little spooked that we will get someone with a bunch of accolades in here that don't know what they are doing, or starts micromanaging way more than they need to. Truth be told we do need a little more accountability and more focused job descriptions - but just a little...
 In the end its probably out of our hands and we just continue to do what we do, but who has been through this and are there any ways to prepare? Obviously we all want to "appear" to have our shit together for a new boss. Some of us don't really care we been doing it long enough though.

 So it's just a general question to you my peers, what would you expect to pay to connect 2 buildings a couple of miles apart?

 I'm helping setup a new network at a local church. They are using all Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment for firewall, switch, Wifi, etc. I'm wondering what others recommend for how to handle a Guest network.
 People will come in every weekend for a service and we want to have wifi available. Device Isolation and bandwidth throttling will definitely be enabled regardless of the options below. I've come up with 3 options for handling the Guest access:
  
Portal - Unifi has a portal available where you have to tap "I Agree" in order to use wifi. This does not require a password of any kind, which is nice, but some devices don't play well with those type of portals
 WPA Key - We could print a passcode on a sign and post them around the building (it's a small building). People enter that and get on the wifi. Pretty straight forward. Could change the password every once in a while if needed.
 Open - No password, no portal, just join and away you go. Most user friendly but least secure.
  
Just curious what others do, or would do, in a situation like this.
 Thank!

 So, I chat with NewEgg to try and resolve the issue...I'm quickly told the message refers to NewEgg's website neweggbusiness.com and that I would have to place the order there, and they supplied a link to the account application page. 
 I asked our accounting person to complete the application to establish the account. Next day, I have my new login to neweggbusiness.com.
 Off I go to shop for my needed M.2 cards...huh, uh, but wait...now the pricing is different, the vendors are different, delivery is a 30 day window? WTF????
 After explaining this to my supervisor, who reports to the owner of the company who despises Amazon, I et permission to use Amazon. I head off to Amazon, where there is no limit, $50 each cheaper, and they will be here Monday...

 My question is: Why do they use these random-looking filenames vs. a standard updater that I could allow once? Is this kind of like password rotation but with executable rotation, to prevent people from being too trusting of any one updater? Might it not backfire in a similar fashion, with people getting used to allowing things to dial out from the temp directory?

 I recently jumped from a 'generalist' sysadmin position to a more specified role within the same organization.
 The generalist position was within a niche part of the org with a small team/little documentation/complex environment. 
 My old boss is requesting I perform both job duties. His words on my replacement "we don't have one we will just wing it." New boss is aware of the requests. He's already looking out for me, wants to make sure old boss does not take advantage of me. These requests were NOT on the offer letter I signed regarding the promotion.
 I respect my old boss, I respect my old small team, I don't want to leave them high and dry... but I'm also excited to move into this specialized role, and I need to spend some time getting up to speed to perform... and honestly, I'm just done with the generalist life, I want to move on, close that chapter.
 Any advice on how I go about this?

 Both modules are green and have a status of "ok." The 10/40 gbps module's interfaces came up and I allocated all except one to the proper VDCs; however, the 1/10 module's interfaces do not show in the management VDC or the production VDCs that they were originally assigned to.
 The second issue is that on the 10/40 card, interface 7 unlike the other interfaces on the card, is broken down into subinterfaces eth1/7/1 - eth1/7/4. Eth1/7/1 does not appear when I do a "show interface status" and when I try to allocate the other three subinterfaces to a VDC I get this error "Port allocate not supported on this interface!"
 Does anybody have an idea of what the cause of these issues are?

 My question is this, though. What qualifies someone as a Senior Network Engineer? Is it just a title? Is it professional level certifications? Is it years of experience?
 ​
 I know this is a very weighted question and will vary based on opinion, but I'm interested in everyone's opinions. At what point do I know that I've achieved my goal? I'm a life-long learner and will continue to grow, but I have to have reasonable, attainable goals (short-term, long-term, or otherwise). Without them being reasonable/attainable they will forever hang above me like a badge of dishonor and no one wants that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I have a topic to get my head around. We´re a small company - not going into details here - going heavy on SQL servers. By now, we have a small on premise infrastructure (4 Hyper-V hosts) which I wanna bring towards Azure in the future. While I plan the migration, I also want to enhance our daylie routines, workflows and such. The network is/was a mess when I took over.
 Back to the topic:
 Our users require access to MSSQL, create/restore backups and make changes to different databases (I want them to be able to spin up their own databases according to their needs). For now, they install MSSQL Server XXXX locally and use a per-core license, which is working completely fine. My problem: I´m sure the licensing is not correct, so I see urgent need to change this.
 My assumtions there is no difference between licensing SQL Server (Per-Core) on a server system or a client system. 
 So my idea was to spin up SQL servers (Dev, Test, Pdroc) with 100% correct licensing, give users access to it with permissions as needed and ban the locally installed SQL servers completely. Any thoughts on this? How are you guys handleing it if the Express edition is not an option due to the restrictions? 
 Thanks for your ideas, have a great weekend!

 Password Managers provide convenience to the end user and enhanced security for the IT departments responsible for that security. Many also allow you to store 2FA tokens in the same place you're storing credentials for that account, thus removing the 'two device' rule 2FA is built on. So the questions every IT department will eventually run into during implementation will be 'Do I provide my end users the convenience of managing their 2FA tokens in a Password Manager?' or 'Do I disable this functionality as a best practice to managing the security aspect of the 2FA rule and keep it segregated to a separate physical …]]></summary>

Why isnt there 3 networks?

 In Azure Active Directory, I would like to change the state of my computers from Azure Registered to Hybrid AD Join.
 As mentioned by Microsoft, we have to use ADConnect to apply this task.
 (In my case, i am using an ADFS server to authenticate our users in different apps and my target (in the future) is to avoid ADFS server to authenticate...)
 ADConnect give us the choice between Federated or Managed domain.
 Even I am using ADFS, can I choose Managed Domain to "Hybrid AD JOIN" my computers???
 ​
 Thanks for your advices.

 Now my problem is my computers are on W10 22H2 and can't get the kb5018410 who patch 0-day vulerabilities. Because no kb5018410 for Windows 10 22H2
 Have you an idea to solve this or when Microsoft plan to release officially 22H2 ?

 I was thinking about things like ZScaler (I still need to look into it) and looking for a DNS service, but beyond that, I'm having trouble coming up with things, so I though I'd see what others are planning on doing.

 EDIT: We have an MDM, ticketing is outside my sphere of influence, but yeah, we do need to improve that too.

I joined about a month ago and I have been mostly learning about the infrastructure system here. I am part of a Security Services Department, which mean we provide Cyber Security solution to other enterprise and my team deals with all the infrastructure devices to ensure the connection works. Our department used many different types of hardwares and softwares. My supervisor is quite busy and doesnt have much time for me.Over my time here so far, my team has been mainly dealing with patch update and migration. Since I think I have gotten the hang on the things here, I want to try and initate areas of improvement and make an impact here. 
 I can share some of the hardware and software we used. VPN: Pulse Secure Firewall: SRX345 Backup:Datadomain AAA: Cisco ACS(Upgrading to ISE soon) Management: Servicenow, BigFix
 Other than those I mentioned above, we have also others like palo alto, fortinet , solarwinds , Vmware and I can share more info if you need more with confidentialty of course. 
 Looking for suggestions on areas I can focus on where I can you know help save time/save costs/save manpower. Thanks you so much!

 I think it would be an amazing oppurtunity, but I’m also scared that it’s a lot of responsibility and I’m not really sure how people at non-ISPs react to people working ”at the root of it all” as it were. 
 So in short, do you consider it just another IT vendor, or is there anything in particular I should know about the ISP industry?

 However I've also tested and it all seems to work with no issues at all so I'm confused. Is it a case that it used to require full desktop client licences and no longer does?

 I originally had 2 domain controllers in my environment, DC and DC2. DC is currently not functioning, the desktop environment doesn't load and a bunch of services are crapping out.
 I moved all FSMO roles successfully from DC to DC2 so now DC2 is the master. I spun up a new DC3, and want to remove DC from the environment by demotion.
 This is the error I am receiving when trying to demote via Server Manager on either DC2/DC3: https://imgur.com/a/Kwoswwv
 Because I cannot log into DC and demote from itself, I'm doing it from the other domain controller's Server Manager by adding the server and removing the AD role / DNS role that way.
 Any idea what this error means and why it is showing up? If there is no way of cleanly removing from the environment, does anyone have a document on how to manually remove and clean up from the domain?
 Thanks in advance.

 I have a very strange "issue" on new machines after they have been imaged using our SCCM task sequence build. So I do apologize if this doesn't make much sense... it isn't very clear for me either.
 When you reboot or turn on these new built machines the device tries to automatically log in to an account and says password incorrect. I can't see this account referenced anywhere in the sccm task sequence and i have no idea why its trying to log into this account when the device turns on...
 Is there any way to control this via a task sequence? When a user turns on the machine, I want the log in screen showing only options for the previous logged in user and "Other User".
 Any advice its really stumping me...

 Recently we started building up our secondary domain here at this school for just our department. Background is that we wanna use VMware Horizon and everyone else doesn't. And with "we" I mean "my boss". 
 Anyhow, we set up a new domain (first time for me going away from open source/linux), got a trust with the main domain. unidirective, transitive. Beacuse of privacy laws and whatnot the users will reside on the remote AD, but they are supposed to log in in our domain.
 This is all fine and dandy, everything works alright, except one thing that I have no idea how to replicate:
 The main domain is called something like domain1.school.int but they log in with [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int)
 now our domain is also underneath school.int like this: domain2.it.school.int 
 I want to be able to login with the same [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int) that they can in their domain, all that works now is domain1\Username or [user@domain1.school.int](mailto:user@domain1.school.int) 
 what exactly am i looking for to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We require a CAA record. We use Sectigo, so I assume our records will look something like this (as per the Sectigo FAQ):
 0 issue "sectigo.com"
 0 issuewild "sectigo.com"
 I'm not entirely sure if Sectigo wants these 2 records or just one of them; their FAQ is a bit vague? Input much appreciated.
 Is there anything else I should keep in mind adding these records?
  
I understand this record only affects the renewal or newly issued certificates, so no matter how much we'd fuck this record up right now, our sites won't be affected as of today, have I correctly understood this? This is crucial - Our certificates are present in a lot of places, so it'd, frankly, be an absolute disaster if these records could negatively impact the sites today.
 Are there any other advice or tips you could give me that I should keep in mind?
 Thank you so very much!

 First time here, newbie on networking problems.
 I'm having problems to make an ssh connection from my host machine (ubuntu 22.04) and my virtual machine in Gnome Boxes (Ubuntu server 20.04). After failing to succeed, I relied on the following guide: https://bytefreaks.net/gnulinux/an-easy-way-to-ssh-into-a-gnome-boxes-os, with which I was able to open the ssh tunnel.
 The problem is that currently, I don't know for what reason, the method no longer works and fails me in a generic: "Network unreachable" error. Do you have any idea why? Also do you know if there is a better way to connect me from host to guest using gnome boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I'm pretty new in the sysadmin world, currently undergoing my training. My first year or something is in the endpoint management/helpdesk team.
 Atm I'm taking care of setting up new notebooks for users. Here's a short description of the workflow:
 Supervisor sends hardware request - > I send out a premade mail requesting info about software the user needs - > I install the software and set up their HCL Notes - > hand out to user
 Now the issue is that the mail that I send out also asks for the user's Windows and Notes passwords. Every cybersecurity workshop will tell users that their sysadmin will NEVER ask for their password (which is totally correct, right?)
 Obviously we'd somehow get into their accounts anyway so handing out the passwords doesn't really change anything, it just feels wrong I guess? And it probably actually is. 
 We need the passwords for a few minor settings in Notes and that's it. I asked my colleagues about it and they answered it with concerns that if users did these settings by themselves they'd scew it up and we'd get more tickets.
 My point of view is that I think that this could be done by the users with a well made tutorial.
 I've been getting more and more confused/negative answers towards the password mails that I sent out so it's also a personal issue because I don't want to answer a mail like "Yes you are totally right, however...". 
 How do handle this at work and how could I change this situation for the better? Thank you for your answers in advance :).

 I’m currently running Kiwi Syslog Server but I’m not very found of it so I’m considering changing it for something better. I feel like I’m missing some nice report features.
 Cloud or on prem, free or paid does not matter much. (As long as it is not too expensive)
 I would like to be able to do the basic things like setting up e-mail alerts, analyze logs, etc. I should also be able to set up alerts based on priority, keywords and more.
 I’m currently picking up logs from firewalls, switches, network thermometers, UPSes and more. Less than 100 devices I think.
 So, what are you using and are you pleased with it?

 What concerns me is on paper it can look like I have a lot of experience, Networking is definitely not my strongest point, but I know all the fundamentals to manage an enterprise network and in general what best practices are. Can I troubleshoot a moderate Networking issue? probably not if it's outside general vlan/firewall traffic rules. If you were to put a Cisco switch Infront of me, can I configure it via CLI? Absolutely not without spending a few good hours googling. I've been spoilt by the luxury of using Meraki and how easy everything is to configure and manage on the GUI that I'm afraid my next gig will be expecting way too highly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this process is to give the CPU something to execute in case there is nothing else to do (thus it is called idle ;-). Let’s think about the next situation, we have a process using 30% of CPU, in that case PID 0 (System Idle) will consume the remaining 70%. Also, Idle is the first process that the kernel starts. Moreover, there is a kernel thread of System Idle for each vCPU the OS has identified .
 The reason for having an “Idle Process” is to avoid an edge case in which the scheduler (Windows schedule based on threads) does not have any thread in a “Ready” state to execute next. By the way, there are also other schedulers IO and Memory, which we will talk about in one of the next posts/writeups.
 When the kernel threads are executed they can also perform different power saving tricks regarding the CPU. One of them could be halting different components which are not in use until the next interrupt arrives. The kernel threads can also call functions in the HAL (hardware abstraction layer, more on that in the future) in order to perform tasks such as reducing the CPU clock speed. Which optimization is performed is based on the version of Windows, hardware and the firmware installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have this setup: 
  
AD domain company.local
 Azure AD hybrid sync (one way only AD -> Azure AD) for Office365 SSO
  
A new domain company.public has been created for training purposes. This AD is completely separated, lives in the DMZ and this is how it should be. 
 We now would like the company.local admins to have access to the company.public AD, just to avoid having multiple credentials as admins. 
 As AD Federation, as I see it, only needs port 80/443 this seems to me the safest way to implement this without "really" connecting the two AD domains (as we really don't want to have them seeing each other).

Ultimately we want to make it so that users can only login with a Yubikey and they won’t have a password at all. In Windows there is no way to disable the username/password login. So I figured we could just change everyone’s password and then just not give the password to them unless they need it for RDP or to setup their Microsoft 365 account on their work phone.
 So my question is, is their a tool that can do this, or can we change every password using PowerShell?

 We have Always on VPN. Deployed as Per the Richard Hicks Book. Works Great. 
 I am deploying the User VPN and Device Tunnels using Intune
 99% of the time the User VPN works and connects Automatically but the Device Tunnel never connects before the login screen. 
 Was hoping to have the device tunnel connect before login incase the user on the computer changes (EG at a site with no DC connectivity)
 I have a Windows 10 Computer. Works fine. Windows 11 won't connect unless I do it manually
 We also have the issue in Intune where it says it failed to deploy but I can see both tunnels on the machine.
 Sort of annoying as I like Direct Access and it was connected when the computer got internet.

 I have been trying to do some research in regards to switch daisy chaining and unfortunately I have been getting a lot of conflicting answers and I am reaching out to see if anyone here as any experience in regards to this.
 I am working on a property that has appx 20 buildings and we have connected each building together via cat6 cable and network switches.
 However it seems like some devices, specifically the devices on the end of the chain not all but some are having connection issues. I did notice some high ms when i ping the devices around 300 - 800. I was told that every switch kind of relights the signal and that I shouldn't be having any issues. It seems like when i try to access the devices web gui it can take several minutes to load. We have appx 30 switches on this chain.
 Any info would be appreciated it.
 ​
 Hope someone can help me out!
 ​
 Thanks
 ​
 Here is some more details.
 Switches are 5 Port or 8 Port Gigabit POE SwitchesDevices - Hikvision Cameras 10/100 POE
 The switches are daisy chained one to the next to the next etc
 CAT6 Cable between the longest switch is less than 100m.

 I have ~2 years of generic sysadmin experience. I got an engineer role centered around power platforms / teams / 365 / exchange (on prem and cloud) around two months ago. I was administering 365 previously and had exchange online experience but no real exchange experience (patching, migrating on prem to 365 and dealing with all that).
 ​
 I feel pretty lost every day, I feel underqualified for this position and am hoping I can fake it until I make it.
 Lately Ive been tasked with automating governance with our power apps platform (Making a CoE environment group that purges inactive groups, sends emails to groups that never had apps/flows made etc). I've zero experience in power apps in general and even after a couple days of learning etc I still feel utterly clueless. For instance, I cannot figure out how to see what the contents are of an orphaned flow, when I share I just get an error about sharing to myself to see what was in the solution flow (which apparently only exists with these).
 ​
 I suppose I'm just seeing if anyone was ever in my situation (went from generic admin to a specialized engineer role) and had success with it. I've feel I'm a pretty competent individual but my God, I have never had job this difficult before. Truly night and day from what I used to do.

 Yesterday using my iPhone running iOS I caught public transport, and opened Word for the first time in a long time and was prompted to login, from the app itself which brought up the standard MFA screen from Microsoft. I selected the SMS option (I know, I've already moved to the auth app) and received the standard "We texted your phone +XX XXXXXXXX12" screen.
 After waiting about 45 seconds (normally, I get them after 3-5 seconds) I received an SMS from: +61 480 458 495 with the body "Hi Use XXXXXX". I immediately called an on-staff engineer, and had them disable and…]]></summary>

Right now if i search what is my public IP it is giving me the public IP that belongs to the private lan, which by way of an ACL or something does not allow external incoming connections. This was something I was told by the managed networks services team. 
 I manually configured the interface metrics in each of the adapter's properties to 10 and 20, with the lower one configured on the adapter I want the public IP to actually be. When I disable the private lan adapter the appropriate public ip is displayed but as soon as I enable, the wrong public IP is back.
 Any thoughts on what I am overlooking here? This used to work but we did some cable management and now it's not working. All of the physical connections are the same as before.

        <updated>2022-10-13T18:45:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 I'm setting up a business 10GbE internal network using a Synology DS1821+ with (8) 16TB 7200 Seagate EXOS drives and two 10GbE RJ45 ports in the rear. This is for a video production company that wants the maximum data throughput to their devices since they frequently edit 4k 120fps uncompressed footage. My plan is to run both 10GbE ports from the Synology to a QNAP QSW M1208-8C through RJ45 to SFP+ adapters, then connect my 8 users to the switch through the remaining (8) RJ-45 ports with Cat6 Cable (all less than 75 foot runs). Additionally, I was planning to connect their modem to the switch using a 1GbE RJ45 to SFP adapter since their current internet speeds are 500/500. 
 My current issue is that I can't find a compatible 10GbE or 1GbE adapter that QNAP lists as compatible with the network switch. Would a generic adapter from FS suffice? Is compatibility required?
 My second issue is future expandability. With the NAS and the internet modem taking up of the (3) SFP ports using adapters, the remaining (8) RJ45/SPF combo 10GbE ports are taken up by the (8) users with RJ45 CAT6 cables. Would the smartest move when it's time to expand be to daisy-chain another switch in through the SFP port? Or purchase a new switch that has more ports?
 My third question is regarding bottlenecks. In each of the computers we have PCIE network cards that are rated for at least 5GbE, most 10GbE. Will our bottleneck be the computer connection or the speed of the Synology in RAID 6? Either way we should have plenty of bandwidth for editing 4k/120fps uncompressed, but I want to be getting the maximum throughput possible out of this system. 
 Thanks so much in advance.

Any time I visit this company he stops me to see if "there's anything you can do to make it faster". At this point Im just at a loss. The computer isnt especially slow, but the user will not accept 'Have less programs open at once' as a solution. I am not sure what he expects, I even told him there's not secret potential on this laptop that I can unlock for you. The company does not want to buy him a new laptop as what he has is pretty nice and would work well for most users. Now I just go in, walk him through PRAM setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a customer that purchased a Layer 2 circuit to connect their remote branch with the main office. Currently, each office has a unique subnet, which is managed by a SonicWALL device at each location. The customer isn't very tech/network savvy, but I've only really dealt with Layer 3 (networking support is more of a side-service our company provides), so I've not had experience trying to connect things over Layer 2. 
 My understanding (forgive me for my ignorance) is that Layer 2 only deals with MAC addresses, so it doesn't know how to route anything to do with Layer 3 (e.g. IP addresses). 
 Per the Layer 2 vendor, we connected the SonicWALLs to the designated ports on the Layer 2 appliances they installed at each location, but I haven't been able to figure out the appropriate configuration to get the two subnets to talk to each other, if that's even possible.
 Here's a rudimentary diagram of how things are currently connected; basically each SonicWALL is connected to the vendor-provided appliance
 Subnet 192.168.10.0/24 SonicWALL A (Port X2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | SonicWALL B (Port X3) Subnet 192.168.12.0/24 
 Since the subnets are separate, I tried setting up a static route on each SonicWALL so that traffic bound for the other office's subnet use the interface that's connected to the Layer 2 devices rather than the default gateway, but it doesn't seem to get through.
 I can try to provide additional information if that would be helpful; I'm just uncertain of what would be relevant here.
 Many thanks for any insight and apologies for my unfamiliarity with this stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So essentially, I'm setting up a network for a client and my boss wants to see if there's a way to setup a VPN before we install the network on site. We do support post-install so we just need a simple VPN to be able to access the network equipment if need be. The site is across the country, so we want to get as much done off-site to save money travelling, hence why we'd like the VPN setup before install. The issue being that we don't know what the broadcast IP of the network will be until we actually go and install it. 
 Is there any way to setup this VPN to connect in a different method? Or does it need to know the target network's broadcast IP to connect?
 VPN setup for remote access isn't something I'm super familiar with so sorry if this is a dumb question/wrong place for it.

 Here's the situation..
 HP C7000 Blade chassis with dual Flex-10 modules. Each module has 2 connections coming out. One goes to one top of rack extreme switch and the other to a secondary extreme switch. The Flex-10 is configured to use both.
 One of the Extreme switches decided to malfunction but not go down hard. So, the Flex-10 still thinks it's there and therefore continues to try and use it (and fails). My guys had to go into the Flex-10 and redirect it all to go to the secondary switch, restart the malfunctioning switch at a remote data center and then go back into the Flex-10 and put it all back. This takes a lot of time and does not help my SLA's.
 I find it hard to get my head around that in 2022, we don't have anything that can determine health of the network traffic beyond a heartbeat. Is there anything out there that you all know of that would work better? I have to have 99.99% uptime so whatever improvements I need to make, I need to do that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tooling around in the MS Graph powershell module as of late because it's the only way to retrieve certain bits of data from AAD. It is my finding that Graph (perhaps just the powershell module, I don't know as I haven't yet started to work directly with the API) is likely the most unreliable system I have ever had the pleasure of using.
 - Every single time I load the module it takes different amounts of time to just do that
 - Switching to the beta profile might take a second, a minute or multiple minutes
 - Running Get-MGUser on a larger dataset might finish, it might not, if it does it might take one minute or it might take twenty minutes. When it fails VSCode just reports the connection was aborted.
 Graph has been around since what, 2019? I haven't talked to a single person that had positive things to say about it at this point. Is this the normal experience with graph? Or is it just the powershell module?

 From what I'm reading off google it has to be implemented on the DC in order to work but just wanted to make sure. Anyone have thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background : we have some Excel files that are probably 15+years old that people just keep updating through different office iterations. Some are to the point where they throw tons of errors any time they open it. I know myself and others in IT have spent countless hours doing our best to assist. Microsoft has said that different Office versions can change formulas or other variables and that likely is where the errors come from. I’ve tried explaining this to the end users that they will need to address the files themselves (fix or recreate. But it seems like quarterly or annually when they need to access some of these problem files the end users keep coming to IT with the same issue that we don’t have the tools, or time to address for what is ultimately an end-user problem.
 So in a broader sense how do you politely tell end-users that the problem they’re having is one that is their responsibility to fix, not IT’s?

 So by years end my job title and role in the company I work for will be changing. I am going from network support engineer to technology project lead. I work for a property management company so we have a lot of turn over as far as properties go. 
 I have been tasked with trying to find a tool or way to better organization the entire process from start to finish of taking on and transitioning away a property. My side of things is still heavy on the network and voip aspect of it all. It would be great if it had sharepoint integration but a big plus for me would be the ability for the rest of our small IT department to look through it when needed. Main focus would be tracking contacts and network information.

Most inkjects are garbage that's to be expected, but I have never seen printers in my life with this level of disconnections, software/hardware bugs, privacy intrusion, etc. The worst is I cannot even TURN OFF WSD on these F&$($ printers! 
 The nature of the business we have most employees working out of third party clinics or from home, so they usually purchase their own printers or the clinics will purchase these crappy things for the staff to use, and it has been an absolute nightmare.
 Don't get me started with the printer models ending with the -e, where you can't set up wifi or even print from the device until you create a stupid ass HP account. I don't encounter even 1/4 of these type of issues with inkjects from manufacturers like Brother or Canon, it's always the crappy HP printers.

 i am currently enrolled in learning programming and one of our recent topics is basic network/-ing.
 So our vm broke down and currently won't be fixed until the end of this course and we're all learning from home.
 I read that thread https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/2r5mgn/best_way_to_learn_networking/ but since it's 8 years old, i want to make sure that maybe some newer stuff is available.
 Long story short, is there any way for me to virtualise or emulate a "basic" network and configure virtual router/switches/vlan and so on?
 Should i install linux on a 2nd pc or rather emulate on my 1st.
 I would be grateful for any guidance, tips, books, youtube whatever.

 Thanks and cheers!

I logged into my account today and after receiving my 2fa from number 122395, I received another from 1-855-909-0331. Hmmmm. Now I am trying to figure out who is at fault here. How did a 3rd party know I just logged into NS in order to send me a fake auth code and how did they know my number? Does NS have a breach? Cant be my phone vendor, for I logged in from a laptop. If traffic was sniffed on my network or pc, there wouldnt be anyway to see the phone number. NS tier1 support didnt know what I was talking about and escalated the case. Hope to get an email from support soon. 
 If anyone reading this could log into their NS account to see if the same thing happens and share your feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.
 Side Thought: Why is NS still using SMS for authentication. They have been around a long time. Would be nice if I could use my Yubikey or even an Authentication App.

 📷
 About a year ago I created a pretty foolproof way to have a shared Service Account that would still require MFA in the cloud, using some Azure Automation and run as accounts. Not keeping up on upcoming changes I see Run As accounts are no longer an option and am trying to adjust my Script to use the managed Identity that is created with the Automation resource. The way it worked before was the Run as Account would get a few permissions once it was created the App Reg would get
  
Application Permissions
 Select User.ReadWrite. All
 GroupMember.ReadWrite. All
 Delegated Permissions
 User.ReadWrite
  
It would also get User Admin RBAC role. All of these permission were needed to change the password of a Synced up account and also was used to Read group membership of a security group that had all users with access in it so if one was disabled it would then force a password change Now with a managed Identity I understand it is suppose to be easier but am not able to get it to Write the changed password . I assume it will also have issues with the group membership changes script also.
 Here is the only snippet of the Script where the Run as account was called
 ## get automation account: $connection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection $azconnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection Connect-AzureAD -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $connection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $connection.CertificateThumbprint write-output "Connected Azure AD" Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $azconnection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $azconnection.CertificateThumbprint write-output "Connected AZ Accounts"

 UK ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-frequently-asked-questions ):
  
Yes, you can mix and match Microsoft 365 plans. Please note that there are some license limitations at the plan level. The Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans each have a limit of 300 users, while the Enterprise plans are for an unlimited number of users. For example, you can purchase 300 Business Premium seats, 300 Business Standard seats, and 500 Enterprise E3 seats on a single tenant.

Yes, you can mix and match Microsoft 365 plans. Please note that there are some license limitations at the plan level. The Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans have a collective limit of 300 users, while the Enterprise plans are for an unlimited number of users. For example, you can purchase 200 Business Premium seats, 100 Business Standard seats, and 500 Enterprise E3 seats on a single tenant.
  
There's no mention of a collective limit on the UK page...is this accurate?

 I'm relatively new to working with Layer 3 and am in the process of rolling out some new routers to some of our satellite sites using Aruba Layer 3 (2930f, 3810m) switches. In my head, I'd like each VLAN to have ip ospf x.x.x.x area backbone so that they show in routing tables as IntraArea (as I think that's technically what they are). 
 However, it seems the 2930s can only support 8 OSPF interfaces? This means I'm forced to use redistribute connected on the OSPF router which makes routes show as External2 (doesn't feel right to me).
 Is this the accepted correct way to configure this or am I missing something somewhere? Thanks!

 I'm currently testing with a laptop into the connection so to bypass any possibility it's something internal
 Ethernet shows connected at 100Mb Speed test results from https://www.speedtest.net/ show download speed in the 20-50Mb, upload looks better as we get 75-90 sometimes. A speed test via Google gets similar download speeds.
 Is there a better tool for checking speed? 
 I understand we won't get 100Mb and that they only offer the speed within their own network but I'd hope to be getting faster speeds than what we have. We've not used Vodafone before and this is not a good experience so far, support has pretty much got me to run ping on the laptop for a few minutes - thankfully this is a backup connection.

 Context is I need to set the ecs cluster instance IP as a var inside all containers for specific logging requirements. The instances rotate frequently for new upgrades etc so the ip changes hence this needs to be automated.
 I've tried a bunch of stuff, and aws even provide a Metadata file that's accessible in all containers for this but I'm unable to retrieve this in a system wide environment variable and it looks like ECS doesn't support this and just passes in the var as a literal string even though it's using docker under the hood and it works in docker fine. 
 I've tried using entrypoint and command parameters and can export variables but this isn't system wide in the containers and they need to be sourced from file or require an interactive shell login e.g /etc/environment or /etc/profile etc
 Any ideas would be appreciated!

 I am not sure if this is right community for my question but maybe someone will be able to comment.
 I am working with 5G enabled technology and I was wondering if there exists any networking device that is compatible with 3GPP release 16 5G network (similar to this https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g_ax but would support rel.16 features). Since release 16 is probably not rolled out by mobile network operators I was wondering if it is even possible to buy rel.16 compatible device in advance. My concerns arise from specific features promised by 3GPP rel.16 for example Integrated Access and Backhaul, CV2X (Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything) which doesnt sound like regular 5G features therefore would require specific modems, right? Another thing is that for example Mikrotik on its product page doesnt even specify specific 3GPP release, only available 5G bands which I think indicates that this release doesnt even matter and this model will be compatible with future versions of 5G. Is that correct?
 I guess my question boils down to - is there any public information from MNO vendors wheter these 3GPP features will even be enabled and if they will be - can I buy hardware for it in advance?

 Throwaway for reasons.
 Posting here as a fallback in case anyone else is seeing this.
 I work for a small-medium MSP and we have a data center where we host customer servers on a Windows Failover Cluster.
 In the last month or so we are seeing (seemingly randomly) RDS Session hosts reporting "offline" in our RMM.
 Notes / Symptoms
  
You can still ping the server (internally)
 You CANNOT browse to any UNC Share (C$, Admin$ etc)
 The FO Role is still "Running" you can open a console session however it will not authenticate to the DC (Domain not available)
 All current users are kicked from the session host
 It DOES NOT happen to all session hosts at once (ie in a farm of 5, 1 will go offline and the others remain online)
 We THINK it is related to Sophos, uninstalled and the issue does not occur (it occured once but we are taking that as a one off)
 Seemingly not related to a Windows Patch
  
Environment(s)
  
Server 2019
 FSLogix with dedicated profile server
 AV Sophos Intercept X Advanced
  
The only way to get it back is to hard power the role down in FO Cluster Manager and then back on, it comes back up fine as if nothing happened.
 Currently we are shifting problem customers/servers to our VMware farm which seems a lot more stable but this is not really something we can do quickly.
 Anyone else seeing this at all? MSFT and Sophos are being very little help indeed, but we are plugging away with them in any case.

 Our school had everything very locked down as most did for a student. The limitations were as I would compare to an exam/ kiosk type account at the time. One IT lesson, I was looking at the pxe boot options and found they were using SCCM. I was hit with a login screen and almost admitted defeat. I thought, what the hell and tried my student details. They worked 
 Turns out the sysadmins had just added the \domainusers group to authenticate. Once launched, I was able to re deploy a Windows environment and more notably to me at the time, create a local admin account. Once I found this out, I was able to sit at my allocated computer and happily install all the programs I wanted and hide my tracks. ICT lessons then turned into 100% fun. 
 One day, I got caught out by a teacher remotely viewing my screen and got called to the IT office. Had to explain what I had done and instead of a slap on the wrist, I was praised for finding the exploit! 
 2 years after I left the school, I then got a job as a system admin at the same school and even used that scenario to my advantage during my interview. 
 And we all lived happily ever after!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Lately at my company, we have a bunch of mails that are send from our own mail server to someone of us, where the mail is detected as spam by our antivirus software. Upon inspecting the source code of the mail itself, we found the following.
 <a [href=mailto:name@domain.com](mailto:href=mailto:name@domain.com)><span lang=FR-LU>[name@domain.co](mailto:name@domain.co)</Span><span lang=NL-BE>m</Span>
 Visually it will write [name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com) but behind the stage it's writing [name@domain.co](mailto:name@domain.co) span span m which doesn't make sense.
 In a normal case it should write this instead.
 <a [href="mailto:name@domain.com](mailto:href="mailto:name@domain.com)">[name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com)</a>
 Does anyone have some ideas as to why this is happening?

 We have a vxlan deployment and have leaf/spine setup. We have POD's where 2 leafs is making up a pod. These 2 are vpc connected.
 Today we have some tracking that is not working at all.
 What i am asking is if i lose uplinks towards the spine, i am very likely to stop forwarding vxlan traffic on the leaf that lost uplinks.
 Cisco states you could have a l3 link between the leafs ( System nve infra-vlans )
 How have you guys done it?

 I know it's been asked a million times but wanted some fresh insight.
 We are a small business, 15TB of data on our server. After migrating servers I was made aware of crashplans terrible speeds...
 I searched other posts and a lot of people reccomend Backblaze.
 We only pay ~$18 a month for Crashplan, with Backblaze it would be about $75 a month for storage alone, with another $20 a month (I believe) for something like cloudberry to pair with Backblaze.
 It's a pretty extreme price jump, and considering our office is in Australia (Blazeback is US based), would you guys have any suggestions?

 This has ruffled feathers with some of the more seasoned end users, who get frustrated with us and sometimes even get snarky when they find out that a license has been deactivated and they’re now expected to change a workflow. 
 While I’m now in a senior position, I spent many previous years in pure HelpDesk getting here and I’ve come to realize that that I’ve got the hero, people pleaser DNA inside of me. I pride myself on exceeding expectations and giving end users the best service I possibly can. On the flip side, I struggle a lot with conflict or disappointing end users to the point that it gives me anxiety. 
 I’ve come to realize now that saying “No” is a critical skill I need to get better at if I want to grow further in my career. I know that you can’t please everyone, and often the company you work for is going to expect you to enforce policies whether you personally agree or not. 
 Does anyone have any insight, advice or strategies on how I could get better at this kind of thing? Thanks!

I click smart card and it shows "Insert a smart card" but doesn't seem to be reading it (no certificates pop up). 
 I believe I enabled the correct GPO settings, since I'm able to connect to the RD Gateway:
 -Force the reading of all certificates from the smart card
 -Turn on Smart Card Plug and Play Service 
 Is there something I'm missing?

Typically when I see that the email server is some random VPC or a compromised host, but today I encountered one involving a thirdparty_with_typo.com hosted on Exchange online, and targetcompany_with_typo.com hosted on G Suite. 
 I reported both to their registrars, and then went to look into reporting the G Suite and M365 tenants themselves and found that a bit more interesting.
 For G Suite I couldn't even find where to do it (everything seemed to point towards individual gmail accounts, not G Suite), and for Microsoft I found https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/cars - but they closed the case after a couple minutes stating:
  
The activity reported is associated with a customer account within the Microsoft Azure service. Microsoft Azure provides a cloud computing platform in which customers can deploy their own software applications. Customers, not Microsoft, control what applications are deployed on their account.
  
So, does Microsoft not actually care about crimes committed using their services, or did I just luck into the wrong support rep responding and closing without understanding.
 FWIW too, the one on Exchange online is spoofing a massive global company (250k+ employees) registered about a month prior to the target, so I wouldn't be surprised if my guys weren't the only ones targeted.

 Hi All! I’ve got a bit of a decision to make….stay in my current role or move out.
 I have a significant background in networking (17yrs) and transitioned to a leadership position as a manager of the network team at my current company. 
 Recently, I was given an opportunity to transition from networking to cloud due to an organizational re-alignment. So I’ve been spending my recent days learning our Cloud platform, Terraform, CI/CD, etc….
 I knew this was going to be a big challenge - but it would come with big opportunities - especially for future growth. It’s been less than a year and things aren’t going great in the role. I have a new leader and everything just feels disorganized and faltering. Our Cloud strategy isn’t strategic and i feel like im fighting against the tide (ex. Let’s migrate everything..Cloud is simple).
 Even the new direction the company is taking has me concerned about its long term viability.
 I have an opportunity to transition back to a Network Manager role with a different company. I love networking!
 My concern…am I making a short term and short sighted move? Cloud is 100% in more demand that networking. Will I look back in 5yrs or 10yrs and kick myself? Should I stick it out at my current company (10yrs seniority) and hope for the best and gain as much experience I can as a Cloud Manager….which isn’t a lot of hands on exposure.
 On the other hand I go into work each day fearing for my job, I’m not happy, and I’m starting to worry that if I wait too long the job market might shift shortly that might result in limited opportunities.
 Looking for the opinion of my peers 😊

 I ran into 2 cases of the issue this week and tried every which way to fix --- my users' Win10 VDI terminals would auto-lock after 1 minute. However, if I rebooted them and logged in, the problem didn't happen. Then, if I logged out and back in, the problem started up again. Very annoying and tricky to troubleshoot. To make it more annoying, the problem would eventually fix itself over night and the user could log in again and work normally. I'm relatively new here and my coworker said he'd never been able to fix it, confirming as well that it would eventually fix itself over-night.
 Repairing VMWare Tools didn't help either. A complete, total uninstall of VMWare Tools and a reboot completely fixed the issue. What clued me in was reading in some forum about a person that updated their mouse driver and had that fix the problem. Sure enough, that was it.

When the MPLS circuit goes down we’d like a failover and failback option. A couple of issues, when MPLS goes down, the link does always go down with it, so a link-state protocol is not the most reliable. Our equipment does NOT support IP SLA. Any advice? We’re hoping to not buy any new equipment right now or gut our entire network at both sites with suitable routers. 
 Thanks!

I understand it needs to go on the access switches and their upstream links to the core of the network but do I also need to put it on the uplink of every device until I get to the DHCP server? Or is it just needed on the source of the originating request and the interface connected to the DHCP server? Sorry if that’s a mouthful. I’m just hesitant to push to production if I don’t understand the big picture

Not that people can't ask, but I think this might be a bit of an overdrawn topic, and if possible, we can have a thread where we refer people whenever they ask.
 Now, there is no shortage of IT asset management software options available, but the difference between them, or any of them, is that they are either open-source or cloud-based. What factors influence your decision? Simple. Your organization's size, the types and quantities of assets you want to track/record, and frankly, how much money you're willing to spend. Anything else is a bonus. Does it integrate well with other platforms? Grand. Has a reasonable API? You might have str…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a couple of issues where the built-in TDR cable test on a Meraki MS120 switch reports cable length of over 100 meters when the actual length is 40 meters or less. Right now I'm looking at one where a MR70 AP is connected and can only get 100 Mbps. The cable test shows an estimated length of 120.75 meters and no connection on pairs 3 & 4. The tech on site had a basic connectivity tester and showed good connectivity on all conductors. Considering where the switch and AP are, I can't imagine the actual cable length being much over 25 meters even with a service loop. (I don't expect the built-in test to be super accurate on cable length, but being like 500% high is a bit much.)
 Has anyone else seen cable issues that cause such high length reports and know what kind of things might cause it?

 We're getting close to having to replace our current SDWAN solution due to the vendor EOLing the product. Currently we use it to tie all our remote site DIAs into a tunnel back to 2 central sites for our workers there to access central resources, with all the SDWAN goodies thrown in as well. 
 We already have FGT firewalls at all our sites and will most likely continue to use them in the future. Currently we use their SLAs and other traffic steering features that their SDWAN presents at face value, but are the advanced features comparable to a full SDWAN solution that would provide a tunnel back to a central location? 
 We're a pretty big SDWAN shop, I'd like to utilize our current hardware but if it can't match up to something independent like Cisco's or Riverbed then we will have to explore that route instead (I really would like to avoid Cisco SDWAN, had enough of a time w/ that in the updated CCNP).

 Current "links in the chain" are:
  
Core switch: TP-Link T1600G-52PS, codename "Colonel"
 SFP module LC/UPC (TP-Link TL-SM311LS)
 60M OS2 single mode fiber (SMF) LC/LC patch cable from Amazon.
 Access switch: TP-Link TL-SG2210MP, codename "Sarge"
  
The SFP module and the cable seem to be compatible and connected fine with an audible *click*.
 VLANS:
  
80: Management. Each managed switch has a static IP in subnet 80:

 OtherSwitch1=192.168.80.5
 OtherSwitch2=192.168.80.6

 I'm working with a client trying to figure out some email deliverability issues. While investigating, I discovered one of their ESP is using their domain and not the client's for the DKIM domain. That's getting that switched to use my client's domain, but I didn't even think this was possible.
 Relevant headers from a test message showing it passing SPF (client's domain) and DKIM (ESP's domain):
  
Authentication-Results:
 spf=pass (sender IP is x.x.x.x) smtp.mailfrom=service.client.com;
 dkim=pass (signature was verified) header.d=esp.com; dmarc=bestguesspass action=none
 header.from=client.com; compauth=pass reason=109
 DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=esp.com; i=@esp.com; s=dkim; c=relaxed/relaxed;
 q=dns/txt; t=1665520754; x=1668112754; h=content-transfer-encoding:content-type:subject:date:to:from:mime-version:list-unsubscribe:x-thread-info:subject:to:from:cc:reply-to;bh=jdBAlGXcZ<snipped>KDm8k=
 From: donotreply@client.com
  
If there doesn't need to be any type of domain name alignment, what prevents a rogue actor from just putting their own DKIM-Signature there. Yeah it could be discovered...but who looks at SMTP headers of all their messages. The damage from a phishing attack or similar may have already been done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I inherited an EMC VNXe3300 years back and have decided I'd like to just sell it for parts, as I have no personal need for it. I'd like to be able to get into the device and securely format all of the data on all of the drives before I sell them.
 The problem is, I cannot get into the interface, and I no longer have access to the EMC/Dell support portal to get the connection utility. I also do not have a miniDBB9 serial cable to connect to the unit, and those cables are ridiculously expensive. Same with SAS USB enclosures.
 Can anyone recommend a cheap way to wipe these drives so I can sell them?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I don't have access to a server to throw these drives in. All i have access to currently is a laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some general input as I'm having trouble coming up with reasons for a specific implementation use case.
 Assumptions:
 - All network access requires Machine Auth 802.1x
 - VLANs separate various computer groups
 - Currently we have a VLAN for Corp WiFi and Corp Network (wired computers)
 - Devices at each branch will never surpass a /23 which is what the corp network (wired computers) is configured for
 - Only the devices which also have the access to join Corp Network (wired) can connect to WiFi
 - Max Devices connected to a single AP would be 50 devices
 ​
 Question:
 Is there any reason why a corp devices which connects via 802.1x WiFi should be put on a separate VLAN or would it be advisable just to join them to the same VLAN they'd join if they were wired?
 ​
 I've seen every business I've worked for separate these networks but while thinking of it I can't really decide why this is happening. I guessed it could be something to do with limiting broadcasts but I'm not sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of my users are on the road a lot, and while the standard built in antennas on Verizon's jetpacks are OK for most areas, we're having issues in specific spots at certain times of day. Talking to my users, here is what they are experiencing:
  
Still getting 4 bars of service
 Intermittent connection drops (download/upload arrows go away) despite the 4 bars remaining
 Apps that require a constant connection drop and need to be logged into again
 Moving the unit around seems to reacquire download/upload (possibly placebo effect)
  
I'm looking into solutions to improve their connection. What I'm not clear on is what the issue is. Doing a bit of research leads me to believe this might be more of an issue of traffic congestion on the tower they are connecting to, or signal interference due to being in a busy area/time of day, than the connection to the tower itself, since they are still getting full bars but receiving poor quality connection.
 Would a signal boosting antenna even help in this case? To me it sounds more like there's too much interference and/or the towers are too busy in these locations and times of day.

 The offer is for a network manager role at a more senior level. Its again a small ISP, the network needs a lot of work, a full redesign. Which is exciting. Fully remote, occasional on site meetings. I do have my doubts about work load as I'd basically be architect and people manager.
 I've accepted and signed the contract.
 But then, yesterday, another role that I'd been waiting on for a while finally came through. This job would push me harder from a technical perspective, but it comes with no seniority. It also requires 3 days a week in the office and would be far less flexible. Did feel more rapport with the interviewers here. 
 I know only I can make this decision. But any tips on how I make it?! They both have their pros and cons, they both offer good progression for my career one way or another. Can't stop thinking about it and still not getting any closer to making a decision!

 We're in the process of configuring various parts of Intune and currently use SCCM. All our devices are now enrolled into Into intune and are Hybrid Azure AD Joined.
 I’m trying to get Windows Update notification popups working for all our Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune, but can’t seem to find the right settings. Currently we have the small restart icon at the bottom right in the task bar but we want to have a pop-up notification so users will be notified in a more obvious way. I think the problem is the following setting in the Advanced Windows Update Settings on all devices. 
 'Show a notification when your PC requires a restart to finish updating' 
 This is grayed out and looks to be set to ‘Off’ but I cannot find where this setting is controlled. As these are all Hybrid Joined devices in Co-management I’ve checked through Group Policy and in our Update Rings policy and Windows Update Configuration Policy but I cant find where to enable this setting.
 Does anyone know where this setting is?

 Accountability isn't a problem, we just need to get better and avoid the "hey did you see that email/dashboard message?" That's the plan right now, just making sure we take turns being proactive about reading a distro and heading to the health dashboard.

PBR has become game changer for us as security guys no more has to deal with unnecessary chunk of traffic which makes firewall use resources to the limit. Now while http traffic between two servers is being redirected to firewall, logging traffic between same servers forwarded directly by ACI thanks to specific contracts.
 We are thinking on what else we can implement on ACI to make life easier. How do you use ACI?

 I have a client who has just bought himself a new mac book running MacOS 12. When I have gotten the device connected into their file shares running on their on prem Server 2012R2. Whenever he creates a folder on the server it will appear immediately, however if he tries to add or edit a file the changes will take up to 3 minutes to show on the server. The changes can take place almost immediately or after a few minutes (almost like it has some kind of polling rate?)
 Interestingly enough if he tries to change a file somebody else is accessing then it will duplicate and show a '°' at the end of the duplicate file.
 I have searched up on the Internet and could see that there were numerous other people having similar problems online specifically with using SMB with this version of MacOS.
 It is worth noting he still has his old mac book that can use the file shares without issue.
 I have tried creating a separate file share and setting the permissions with full access for everyone but still experiencing the same problems.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. And I can provide any further details if needed.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got several cases, where users complain that after Monthly patches being installed they see only one notification from Software Center (Config Manager), it's the last one which gives them 15 minutes to a forced reboot. It was not a case for everyone so I started digging and I found that it happens only for people who use the "Focus Assist" feature in Windows 10 (former name "Quiet hours"). So it was obvious that people who have set "Alarms only" won't see the reboot notifications, but there is also an option called "Priority only", where you can select applications that can show notifications - this works well when the user chooses Software Center as a priority app manually, via the GUI.
 I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to centrally add items to the priority applications list (via GPO or script)?
 The ideal solution would be to:
  
Disable "Alarms only" mode in Focus Assist
 have a possibility to add "Software Center" to the priority list applications

 I dont want them to see and configure anything on our site/Domain, thats why i want to implement an External Domain Trust - Non-Transitive with Selective Authentication.
 I set it up in my lab and the only thing i dont understand is, how the other Domain should make use of the Selective Authentication when he doesnt have access to our Domain to select the Users which should be able to authenticate on their resources.
 When i click on the resource domain on ntfs settings, i can change the location to the other Domain but will be prompted for credentials access it.
 How can i manage it so the other Site can configure their Selective Authentication without Domain Credentials from my Domain?
 i cant really find any resource on that.. Just some Videos where they enter the Domain Admin from the Domain, which is a huge security concern for me.
 ​
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, just seeking advice here.
 My IT team has recently been hired to work at a 1300+ user school and have taken over the whole operation from the old staff. It’s a mix of around 300 BYOD laptops and 1000 supplied Windows laptops.
 The virtual infrastructure is an absolute mess. Blends of Server 2012/2016 VM’s running on an outdated ESXI host.
 We would like to rebuild the VM’s for starters (File/Print, DC1, DC2, NPS) but we’re not sure how to do this to minimise downtime, especially for the BYOD devices.
 The file/print server would be the biggest headache. Next would be cutting over NPS and making sure all of the devices connect up okay.
 How do you even begin to do this to prevent any downtime/issues with a site of this scale?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This problem stumps me and my colleagues to no end...
 I'm hoping someone here can help think this through?
 One of our endusers has the problem where his ethernet connection drops at random intervals, and his Wi-Fi doesn't pick up the slack automatically either.
 Here's what we tried:
  
New UTP cable
 New docking station
 Connected the cable directly (without docking station)
 Gave him another laptop (issue occurs on 2 laptops now)
 Colleagues tried the same outlets/the same cables, and they can work just fine
  
There are no overarching GPOs on his laptop that cause this.
 One thing we saw was that his domain firewall profile was set to ON while it should be OFF.
 That can't be the cause because it was the same for me and I have no issues whatsoever.
 I started checking winevt logs.
 We can pinpoint when the system dropped UTP and the user had to manually connect to Wi-Fi instead:
 A request was made to authenticate to a wireless network.
 Logged: 12/10/2022 11:05:32
 Checked the Security winevt logs; all we saw was the firewall started to check all policies right after the system lost UTP connection. After Googling possible ethernet drop issues I wanted to disable the Energy/Green Energy/Wake on Magic settings in his ethernet adapter to see if that could help, but I can't reach his device right now. When he's forced to make a manual switch to Wi-Fi we have to reverse connect to his laptop and then run an ipconfig /registerdns before we can continue troubleshooting (most likely due to the fact we are in the middle of a DNS server cutover and those managing the transfer are veggies...).
 Even though, these are all things that shouldn't transfer from one laptop to another yet he's had the problem on 2 laptops one after the other now.
 Anyone have any clue on what could be causing this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I have a UDM Pro SE which has fiber on WAN1 and a 4G router on WAN2 (a Teltonika RUT241).
 The 4G router does CGNAT, so in order to easily reach the Web GUI for admin purposes I've installed ZeroTier on it and it works well, I can reach it from a LAN device (a mac mini) with ZeroTier installed.
 BUT, Tailscale works so much better for me, so that's what I'm using on all other devices (the 4G router doesn't support Tailscale, only ZeroTier).
 My question is if I can somehow bride the LAN to the ZeroTier network using the mac mini as a bridge since it has a network interface for both networks? When I'm inside my LAN using Tailscale I'd like to route traffic to the Zerotier network (192.168.192.0/24) via the mac mini.
 I'm guessing I should setup a static route, pointing traffic going to the destination network 192.168.192.0/24 through the LAN device on 192.168.5.142 (the mac mini), but do I need to do something on the mac mini to make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Not sure if I’m somehow missing it, but we’re implementing some 80KM dark fiber and we purchased some 100G 80KM QSFP28 modules at 1310nm. However, the loss is a bit high (no link possible) so we wanted to try 1550nm which of course has better attenuation figures, but I can’t locate any QSFP28 100G modules operating at 1550nm??
 Funnily enough though I have found posts in this subreddit with people saying that at 80KM all DWDM modules will be 1550nm - but the exact opposite seems to be true.
 The loss over the link appears to be about 23-26dBm according to our 10G 1650nm 80KM modules, so I’d expect at 1310 it’s closer to 36db of loss.
 I assume the recommendation would be EDFA, but any other suggestions for reliable 100G over this link would be appreciated :)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's put aside the fact that throughout the years whenever I faced a problem with CPU usage/high clock I usually faced a 95+ System idle. I faced similar situations on Linux with 100% of the cases ending in htop (linux command) showing me the exact culprit. If not by CPU usage then by CPU wakes.
 Recently my opinion solidified when facing the highest CPU usage I've ever seen on Windows 10 on my laptop. This time I knew the culprit upfront (broken windows search, confirmed by windows reliability history error messages). Windows Search constantly banged the CPU and failed to start, CPU die constantly at 65 deg C. As soon as I fixed Windos Search the CPU die temperature dropped to ~40 deg C! The thing is the entire time neither of the built-in Windows Tools (including the Sysinternals Process Explorer) showed any useful information on the issue. No listed component spiked to more than 3-5% of CPU. Even the memory usage tab in Resource Monitor was better at hinting the culprit than the releavant CPU sections!
 What are your thoughts?

 I'm running a small scale test on 802.1x in preparation for a company-wide rollout. We're using Cisco catalyst + Microsoft NPS with EAPTLS. On the Windows side of thing everything is working flawlessly but I'm struggling to get a working MAB policy on NPS for the IP Phones (This model does not support 802.1x) 
 I have seen a few methods of configuring MAB on NPS. One involves setting up a user with username/password as the MAC address. This wont work in my environment as the password is just getting rejected due to complexity requirements. 
 The 2nd method I have seen involves setting up a connection request policy like so : 
 Conditions: 
  
NAS Port Type = Ethernet
 Calling Station ID = ^00-00-00-00-00$|^11-11-11-11-11$ 
  
Authentication: 
  
'Accept users without verifying credentials'
  
The the switchport is configured like so: 
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1 description Access-Port switchport access vlan 101 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 107 access-session host-mode multi-domain access-session closed access-session port-control auto mab dot1x pae authenticator spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable service-policy type control subscriber DOT1X2MAB end 
 When connecting the PC works fine, but the IP phone is failing , then the switchport gets err disabled as a result. Is anyone able to advise on where I am going wrong ? Documentation on MAB in NPS seems to be lacking

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a bind to look for an elegant solution to get the following failover solution working and I wondered if anyone here might have any ideas? 
 Diagram as follows : Diagram 
 Simple two site setup with both sites having their own WAN link for internet as well as site to site connectivity. 
 The MPLS wans are setup with eBGP so each Cisco router receives the prefix of the other site via that WAN link for reachability to each other. 
 The LANs of both routers are setup with two subnets and are setup using VRRP. with each router acting as the active VRRP group for each subnet: 
 Site1 : 192.168.1.254
 Site2 : 192.168.0.254
 VRRP is setup so in the event of the WAN going down the other router takes over as VRRP master. 
 This means that as well as resilience that both WAN links are fully utilised instead of all traffic just using the one WAN link. All good! 
 The issue is that due to the point to point interface and VRRP that if the point to point dies so site1 can no longer reach site2 using the point to point that you would want that traffic to go out via the WAN into the MPLS to reach the other site. 
 The problem is of course it won't do that due to each of the Cisco routers having LAN's which belong to both subnets. So if traffic was going from Site1 to Site2 then as soon as those packets destined for 192.168.0.0/24 hit the Site1 router then it would just not send it out's its WAN as it has an interface belonging to that subnet which is up and part of the VRRP group. 
 This is the problem I'm trying to solve. A solution which I don't like is to create a EMM script which will shut down that LAN in the event traffic is no longer using the P2P but I don't like how messy that could be. 
 Anyone got any ideas or suggestions then I'm open to them :) 
 I hope that made at least some sense?

Every time we onboard a new user and plug in their new device it just gives us a unidentified network. But any other user on the network that was there a couple months back can get an address. I've tried statically assigning the wired endpoints with no luck. The other weird thing is when we connect to the Main wifi, it states not internet and when I statically assign an unused IP address, it then works just fine. We have 3 managed switches that I have tried plugging my laptop directly in and still have no luck.

Will be migrating items from two source locations to M365 GCC/Gov't Tenant as the destination (hence the reason I am migrating to a new tenant). Destination M365 tenant will be cloud only/no AD Connect in place. 
 Source locations and use are:
  
Google Workspace -mail, contacts, calendars, Drive data - migrating using BitTitan (no issues here and the migration is already pre-staged/processing)
 M365 Commercial/Non Gov't Tenant- Used for MS Office licensing and small bit of unexpected OneDrive use. This tenant uses AD Connect to sync users to local AD at the moment and has the company domain name in use as the primary domain for all users.
  
I am planning on performing this migration this weekend and need to confirm what my process should be to either disable or decommission AD Connect from the existing M365 commercial tenant but keep the users intact (just in case I need to manually move any data over)- while allowing me to remove the company domain in use on the existing M365 tenant. 
 I'm familiar on the process of decommissioning AD Connect in full, but know that can take up to 72 hours and I can't make any changes during that time. What process should I be following if I want to make the users cloud only/change their usernames to .onmicrosoft.com addresses from the tenant so I can remove the company domain from the existing M365 tenant at the same time (hopefully in one evening?)

They would like to supply an ethernet wire to the deli so they can connect their switch and other wired devices (think POS / credit card terminal / PC) to said switch.
 From my short research, it seems like I would need a managed switch separating the two networks via VLAN. So basically, ISP Modem / Router > Managed switch:
 > Ports 1&2 for the food store > Add another switch (does it matter if its managed or unmanaged?) for the food store's wired devices
 > Ports 3&4 for the Deli > Add another switch (does it matter if its managed or unmanaged?) for the deli's wired devices 
 Wifi SSID will not be broadcasted to limit wireless devices. 
 Am I even remotely on the right path to accomplish this? There is only one ISP available at this location and they can't provide a separate service just for the deli.

 So I'm in charge of setting up the 802.1x for a new site we are moving to. I work for a company with around 200 sites around the country and a pretty big DC with ACI, ISE, SD-WAN etc.... all across these sites.
 The normal way of doing things like segregating users has been via VLANS and FW rules. However with this new site I've setup and tested an 802.1x config I've done with TEAP for Windows users, EAP-TLS for MAC'S and MAB for cameras etc... all working. My plan was to see what AD group the user coming into ISE was in and the delegate them a VLAN tag on ISE and pass it back to the Authenticator switch, it all works. But after speaking to my lead today, he suggested a couple of things or ways of going about doing user segregation at the new site.
 We have been talking about what is the best way to go about IP addressing schemes for users at the site, do we create seperate VLAN's for infrastructure/networks, finance, HR etc.... with their own subnets or do we put them all into one big range (a big broadcast L2 domain I know, but kit these days can handle it to be honest) and then look to use SGT's on ISE and assign them segregation based off them that way.
 Any opinions or other suggestions would be welcome.
 Thanks everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we are having an issue when some of our spoke sites that have 2x MPLS circuts (no broadband etc...) and one circut is a higher bandwidth than the other in all of them, I never set the solution up but it is live in production now and if the primary link fails, then it takes a good few mins to switch over to the second lower bandwidth link. There are 2 static routes going out both links (same administrative distance) but the second lower bandwidth link has been set to the "last resort circuit" command and the primary higher bandwidth link is the only link/interface that appears in the routing table.
 In comparison, the same setup is also on sites that have the same bandwidth across both links, if the primary circuit fails then it is a seamless transition to the second circuit and both static routes are in the routing table to.
 Anyone any advice on where/what I could look to change in order to make this work better and for the second link at the sites with unequal bandwidth links, to be able to seamlessly switch over to the second link?
 Cheers

 We are working on a project where a run from the network room will lead outside, underground through a conduit, and then to an outdoor area. This is about 300ft. Then there will be a run from that outdoor area to another outdoor area roughly 300ft out. To me, that is something multimode fiber can easily handle, but I'd like to hear what others have experience with. I know the cost will be higher for transceivers, but this is for a third party client. Im not trying to nickel or dime or mess with a sale for a cable company, but I also want to learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've taken over responsibility for an Aruba 6000 48G R8N86A switch that in another state and I cannot get signed in. I have an old config file showing the local accounts with ciphertext passwords, as well as the radius config with ciphertext of the pre-shared key.
 Access-Requests hit the radius server (Windows server NPS) and are rejected with "Authentication failed due to a user credentials mismatch. Either the user name provided does not map to an existing user account or the password was incorrect."
 I am using known good credentials.
 If I change the PSK in NPS, I continue to get the same error message so I suspect NPS client config might have the wrong PSK.
 Question 1. Is there a way to reverse the cipher text on the PSK?
 I attempted to set up new connection request policy in NPS, and under SETTINGS->AUTHENTICATION I checked the box for "Accept users without validating credentials" and then I see Access-Accept sent back to the switch, but the switch still rejects with "Access Denied".
 Question 2. Does this not work how I think it would? Any other way to force a successful authentication in NPS to get logged in?
 I also blocked radius traffic from switch->Radius server to get it to time out and attempt local creds. No documented creds will work.
 Question 3. Similar to Q1. Is there a way to recover local password from the ciphertext?
 There is no remote support at this location. I'll have to drive 6 hours to reset it if needed... Lol

 When rounded to the nearest thousandth, most input errors are 0.002%. I read a Net craftsmen post saying that anything above 0.001% should be investigated.
 In most cases, the switch is reporting a 0.000% output error rate.
 In some cases, both the switch and the node show an error rate. Examples below.
 Most of the connections are to the same switch; I'm not sure this matters.

 Node Node input error rate Switch output error rate 
  
 1 0.002% 0.000% 
  2 0.002% 0.009%

Do you agree with that threshold for error rate troubleshooting?
 If yes, would you clean only the SFP/Fiber on the node side if the node is showing errors but the switch is not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm inheriting a job supporting a SATCOM hub network at a teleport. It's a small-ish site that provides Internet or managed network access to a few hundred remote SATCOM terminals via a small number of high bandwidth uplinks. My background is in radio networking (MANET, microwave, trunked voice & data, etc) but I'm fairly competent with Cisco R&S gear.
 This site has been badly neglected and is in acute need of a tech refresh. It currently has about 12-14 access switches and six routers that manage IP traffic between the modems and other infrastructure, and an old ASA that connects to the Internet and provides remote access via AnyConnect. I plan to replace the switches and routers pretty quickly, and the firewall soon after.
 I'm going to write a preliminary proposal to outline the tech refresh project and justify funding for subsequent trade studies and eventual capital purchase.
 Now for my question: I'm a little turned off by Cisco's extremely high prices, the complexity of their feature licensing, and also their super long lead times right now. I have positive impressions towards Juniper and Extreme gear, though my experience with them is limited. Given the relative simplicity of this network, I've wondered if I could get by using Ubiquiti or Mikrotik, but ultimately I think we'll want a paid support option. Assuming a homogeneous environment meaningfully reduces complexity and risk, is there a single brand that might be best suited for this application?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years back there was a post here from a traveling data center technician in NYC(?). I may be a bit murky on the details but he had a portable standing desk for data center work. From what I remember, it was basically a platform with a single telescoping pole in the center with a rubber foot on the bottom. It came apart easily and packed into a backpack so he could travel from data center to data center working. There was a link to it and it was a small company making these specifically for technician field work. 
 Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? I've searched and have been unable to find anything beyond cheap plasticy tripod options on Amazon that don't look like they'll hold up for professional use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I design IOT devices and a feature I’m adding allows my devices to identify one another on a network. The goal is for each device to be able to scan the subnet and find one another so they can show users “devices found on your network” rather than requiring them to type in each IP/host name. I’ll allow typing in for cross-VLAN or other setups, but would like to suggest them units where possible to make it easier. 
 What is the best way to do this? I see this with things like my tplink controller where it can find my access points on the network and suggest them to me. Is this just brute force pinging each IP in the subnet at a specific endpoint and looking for a certain response?
 Not looking for a full on explanation, just need a term or concept to be able to research more into. And looking for suggestions as I’m sure there are many ways to do this. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assumptions are the root of all evil.
 I constantly screw myself on a daily basis by making assumptions. I can't count the amount of times where I have been handed an issue by a junior tech and started working on more complex solutions but in the end it was something simple that someone forgot to check or assumed was correct.
 The only safe assumption is that no one has done anything correctly ever and everyone is lying to you. Users will make things sound extremely severe to get a problem solved quicker, techs will make assumptions and pass those assumptions on to you. If you haven't seen that information yourself, then you're working off of a paper foundation in the middle of a hurricane. I know this sounds extremely pessimistic, but Dr. House was right all along.
 The amount of time wasted double-checking something is almost never as long as the amount of time wasted trying to solve a problem that you may already know the solution too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, seems like I should be swimming in solutions here, but I'm struggling a bit. Company is standing up a new enterprise application that is going to be the backbone of the organization. Needs to be extremely highly available and fully support blue/green deployments. The application has a content storage component that just needs to point to an NFS share. Making that NFS share highly available / fully redundant is an exercise left to the implementer, and I'm waffling a bit on deciding what makes sense.
 Solution needs to be fully replicated, clustered, and highly available (instant failover either during outage or during deployments). We also need to be able to support our DR process which currently is replicating on prem VMware VMs to Azure.
 We were going to go with GlusterFS, but just found out that Redhat has killed that product and we definitely want enterprise support for whatever solution we choose. Their replacement, Cephs, seems to be way overkill for what we need.
 Would love some suggestions! Thanks!

 The problem is we don't control what an app (Teams, Outlook, 1000 in house apps, 300 SaaS apps, and more) chooses to use.
 From LDAP alone the apps can get SN, CN, givenName, lastName, displayName, etc. Then you have HR legal name, Peoplesoft preferred name, etc.
 Edit: add job title to the mix while we are at it.
 We just can't force all apps to use the same source. And if we did, the name would still be wrong from the user's perspective many times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Short version: What is the best way to do a local domain mesh that supports local broadcast protocols, as well as some L2 jiggery pokery on an airgapped network?
 Long version:
 Large scale professional audio/video/lighting networks currently all setup as airgapped switched only networks with a lot of protocols relying on local broadcast for discovery and function. As these networks get bigger we run in to topology problems trying to maintain HA/resiliency/redundancy.
 It gets very awkward when your network is down, the show is stopped and you have a live audience of 20000 people and millions watching on television.
 Most networks end up as a ring (with RSTP or EAPS), or as one long daisy-chain (broken ring). Some folks will run parallel links (that are unconnected until one fails and then the spare gets manually plugged in)
 It looks like TRILL would have been a solution, but it seems that it really never took off, so I am looking at routing solutions.
 Requirements: fast convergence times, once routers are configured the first time: plug and play operation in the field, loop/feedback protection, mesh ability, and the endpoints see all local broadcast traffic.
 From what I gather OSPF/EVPN/VXLAN might be the solution?!? Any other ideas, links or info on configuring those together? Pitfalls?
 For reference, some lighting networks:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is more of a vent if anything. I think this move Zoom made to rebrand 'Chat' to 'Team Chat' was such an oversight. Idk if their marketing people and PMs have no idea what they are doing. or if they simply don't care to review changes. 
 My first gripe:
 the changed the name to Team chat. gag. 
  
there is already a product called... teams. nice move Zoom
 not everyone who i am messaging is part of my 'team'- like someone from a different team or an external person like my sales rep. it would have made 100% more sense to call this Company Chat. 
 there reason for doing this was because people got 'confused' when using meeting chat vs Zoom Chat. So they changed it for everyone because the free users and guest users got confused. lol
  
But this is the part that got me. is this blog post:
 https://blog.zoom.us/work-better-together-with-zoom-team-chat/
 they try to talk about 'toggle tax' and then try to justify not using email and just use Zoom Team chat. This is a major SMH 
 "Need to share an important design and the context behind it with a colleague? Don’t break focus by signing into your email account and drafting an email — simply pop into Team Chat, type up a message, attach the file at the click of a button, and hit send!" 
 Can't say i have ever had an app tell me "use our app to talk instead of sending an email" that shit is funny. who writes this shit.

We had a leadership change and he pointed to the sky aka cloud. So that's where we are, multicloud whether we were planning it or not. It's in better shape than that sounds. 
 It's renewal time and we just don't need the complexity or cost of ACI. Knowing the switches (some of em) also support NX-OS mode and with the reduction in footprint we've had since the cloud migration I'm thinking we can migrate out of ACI by shuffling some links around, Converting some stuff to NX-OS mode and shuffling back. I don't have a fully fleshed out plan but has anyone else done it? You know how it is, if you're doing something you're probably not the first.
 Edit: I know it’s easy to switch between modes. That’s not really what I’m talking about. Asking if anyone has done it and more importantly did you hit your head on the way out? Crazy gotchas etc.

We are looking to set up a hybrid Azure AD system, as we use 365 but still have various on prem required software, and whilst watching a Microsoft video on the subject, they are trying to suggest people move away from on prem entirely, unless they're using software or older systems that explicitly require it. Is this just Microsoft trying to sell Azure and 365, or is it much more of a trend than I initially thought?
 For smaller companies, I don't see any reason not to use Azure, but it strikes me that even with a full Azure AD and Endpoint Manager suite of tools, you still lose out on a lot of configuration that group policies offer, albeit it with other advantages too

Is copper going bye bye? Will there only be optical switches in the next 5-10 years? How will I get cables with pretty cultures to satisfy my OCD?
 EDIT: By optical I mean SFP/QSFP where you can still use copper but many use the SFP+ DAC cables.
 EDIT2: just want to say I appreciate the great responses.

 I currently have a pair of fairly critical ASR1002-X routers in our DC that haven't been upgraded/rebooted in about three years. They're both on asr1002x-universalk9.16.09.05.SPA.bin currently, running in bundle mode and need to be upgraded to asr1002x-universalk9.17.03.05.SPA.bin (will also require a ROMMON upgrade to asr1000-rommon.173-1r.SPA.pkg).
 Can anyone that's done a similar upgrade path (16.X.X to 17.X.X) guide me towards any pitfalls/recommendations for the upgrade procedure? Pretty much every upgrade documentation I've found talks about install mode being the best option, should I convert these or does it really matter? 
 Also with the ROMMON upgrade, can that be done in one go alongside the IOS before a reboot or does it require multiple reboots (ROMMON upgrade > reboot > IOS upgrade > reboot)?
 Thanks for the assistance!

 Trying to cover all possible permutations of configuration is a monumental task and cardinality quickly becomes an issue. For example, say I have 1 physical topology with 2 CE devices connected to 2 PE devices, connected to the other side across …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm configuring an Intune environment and testing with drive mappings. I have a single Z: drive using OMA-URI configurations similar to this article, initially works fine. But every day it seems to try to remap it. I end up with an inaccessible Z: drive with a red X over it saying the drive letter is already in use, and then I have a Y: drive mapped to the location the Z: drive originally was, also saying the path isn't available.
 I have to remove both, remap Z: and it's fine again.
 What I'm looking to do is a (hopefully) simple powershell script that maps that drive, that I can package as an app instead of a script or configuration profile.
 I can make a script that simply maps the drive with net use easy enough and send output to a file that I can use for "install" detection, but I feel that having a check for the existing drive letter(s) first would be best since there are plenty of already-deployed Intune machines in production that will end up getting this new "app"/script applied.
 I realize I'm "asking for the fish" here, when I'd normally prefer to learn how to fish myself, but given that this is already in production I'm hoping a few of you might have the time and be willing to help me out.
 I can do a basic script in the meantime that will just blanket remove Z: and Y:, remap Z:, and send the output somewhere the user won't accidentally delete it, but I'm sure there are much more efficient ways to do so.
 Ultimately what I am hoping to accomplish:
  
Check existing drive mappings (I've found that it doesn't add a 3rd letter, so can probably focus directly on Z: and Y:)
 Remove existing mappings
 Remap Z: to the proper path
 Check Z: to confirm its accessible
 If Z: is fine, send some output to a text file that can be used for program detection so that it's not constantly executing against the same machines

 I have a situation where I have some clients working from home. Due to compliance, I have to prevent them from being able to talk to other devices on the network (such as home PCs, IoT devices, etc...).
 We use ESET Endpoint Antivirus and RocketCyber SIEM/SOC software. Both of those applications have an isolation mode that prevents that PC from talking to anything other than the ESET/RocketCyber console.
 Is there anyway to achieve this type of protection using only software, but still allow WAN/Internet access (so basically it can talk to the gateway and nothing else). The isolation modes in the applications I mention, prevent general WAN/Internet access as well... so they won't work in this situation.
 However, since they are able to lock it down to a specific port/application... I assume there must be some way to do what I am describing. I searched around looking for Windows Firewall rules, but those seem to be limited to very specific protocols/ports. I would like true isolation like Wireless access points do in Guest mode.
 Since this is in multiple home networks, I don't really have the option to create network segmentation (VLANs, etc...).
 Any help is greatly appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm well versed in remote desktop, having operated several for coming up to two decades. However, this is something new to me...
 We have a customer who's got 30-40 users within a latency of circa 5-10ms to the remote desktop session host. However, they've just had 4 outsourced users added from India (we're in the UK). Each Indian user is around 150-200ms.
 When we have 40 UK-based users concurrently online, the server CPU can sit roughly at 60%. However, if you swap a couple of UK users for Indians, the server CPU will spike and sometimes sit at 90% with spikes to 100% and the associated freezes you get when out of resource.
 Strangely, this manifests itself in a Windows Explorer process taking between 10-20% CPU for each user. However, if you right-click the Windows Explorer process and choose to restart it, the user sees a brief flash on their session as the explorer is reset, and CPU usage dips back to the circa 0% that it normally uses for other users. It quickly returns to the 10-20% range though.
 I was just wondering whether anyone has noticed the correlation between client latency and server CPU usage?

 Quotes / Sales Orders do not seem to have a cost price or margin? If you are supplying a Laptop to a customer, tracking profit is crucial. 
 It does have a Services section, which is a big plus as most CRM do not. We were thinking of adding monthly services, IT Support per X users, 365 licences etc. However it seems to be hell bent on having services as a per hour item. Which means it doesnt really work. 
 Why is this always so complicated?
 Do I try to customise it, or is there something better out there?

 I wasn't able to find any relevant user groups except maybe for this subreddit as I saw many posts about EATON UPSses here. The device itself is working fine and I am really happy. But some tiny thing is bugging me.
 I am running an audio interface (RME Fireface UCX II) via this UPS , next to a monitor, active studio speakers and a mac studio. When I turn the outlets of this UPS off in the evening, and wait a little, I can see the display of my Fireface briefly flashing on and off again - every 30 seconds or so.
 The power doesn't seem to cause it boot up, so I don't see anything on the display, just the backlight briefly turning on and off for a split second.
 This doesn't happen if my interface is connected to a different wall socket next to the EATON UPS.
 I have the EATON Ellipse ECO 1200W
 Is this anything to worry about? Can this cause wear on the electronics on high-precision audio devices like these?
 Already sent an email to EATON customer support but you know how these things are - sometimes you hear from them, sometimes you don't. Curious to hear your input on this!
 Thanks in advance!

(We have multiple locations - most of which have 50mb fiber as the primary connection and some flavor of cable or non-dedicated fiber as the backup.) The proposal looked promising and would save us around $200/mo per location. There would be no managed router, and supposedly I would get an online portal where I can throttle speed in real time. Not a huge need, but an interesting proposition, none the less. Of course, the ATT rep couldn't/wouldn't give me any other 'cons' that might be an issue and even said they could get us out of our current contracts and give us the same or better SLAs that we have now.
 So, I come to you, good people of Reddit. Who has experience with this ASEoD product, can offer insight as it compares to DIA fiber, or any other advice along these lines. Have you used this portal they speak of? Is it awesome or meh? Pros? Cons? TIA

 Which cloud service would you recommend me to use for backing up the data from my phone like photos, contacts, etc., which I can also use for my laptops? I would have 4 devices, in total, for which I would use the cloud service(s). I can use the Microsoft 365 Personal for the phone like I would use the Google One cloud service, or the single option is to use Google One for phone back-up and Microsoft 365 Personal for laptops?

 I am again in the position to generate another 1000 free places on my Udemy JNCIA course, I have been asked why I am offering it free to Reddit / LinkedIn ect and its because if I can give away the course that will benefit others.
 Some instructors just post their courses on giveaway sites and end up getting enrolments that are never used, I want to offer it to people that might at some point have a look and maybe find it useful.
 As a new instructor myself I have found the feedback to be most helpful and once my other courses are completed, they will be offered free to.
 Any feedback is welcome.
 The below code is valid for 5 days however once signed up you have the course for life.
 I thank you in advance and good luck in your studies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let me preface this by saying that this is absolutely their choice and I'm not going to try to stop them, I just want to see if there is an alternative.
 The company I work for has been purchased by another company in another continent. It's a really good business move for all involved. We're now talking about the collaboration between our IT departments, and they would like to migrate into their 365 tenant, which they have done for all of their previous acquisitions.
 I don't inherently have an issue with this, but we are considerably larger than their previous acquisitions, and utilise O365 a lot more than these smaller companies (and it sounds like we utilize more than the new parent does with regards to Azure and Intune/Autopilot, etc.).
 I did a very brief stint at an MSP before working here, and there we used some kind of Partner Portal to look after all of our 365 tenants. Is this something that the parent company can do and onboard our tenant as a whole, separate entity? I thought this was the case, but the more I look at it, the more it looks like the Partner Centre scheme is something for resellers (which the parent isn't, but the aim is for them to provide licences to us, along with collaboration on projects, so there might be some overlap there).
 Am I barking up the wrong tree here and have the wrong idea about the Partner Centre? Is there something else I should be looking at and have been searching for the wrong terminology? Or is them merging us into their tenant the best practice here?

 ​
 So all OK so far, Preview updates by default are not pushed to WSUS.
 But If we have Azure VMs, and they use Azure Update Management and for the repository they use Microsoft Update, we will probably get this "Preview" updates by default or not?
 Since we want to get rid of WSUS for the Azure VMs, what will actually happened...?
 If we have for example test environments on WSUS which are without "Preview" updates and then for production use Azure, we are going to have different updates installed there... How do you solve this in your environments, should we also deploy WSUS to Azure, or include preview updates on test environments?

The weird thing is, this only happens for regular users, not admin users. I have been searching online and found that I could run the following command: 
  
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode –Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”} 
  
This doesn't work for me because it gets blocked by applocker. Also in the eventviewer under 'Applications and Service Logs/Microsoft/Windows/AppXDeployment-server' I see a lot of errors regarding packages that cannot be installed/updated due to applocker restrictions. Example of the error: 
  
AppX Deployment operation failed for package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy with error 0x80073D01.

I tried to allow the packages in our applocker GPO and reboot the servers, but that didn't fix the issue either.

 I also tried to delete the firewall rules in the registery, but that does not seem to work either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ridiculous task of the week, we've been tasked with securing access to Office 365 for someone using a personal MacBook. With Windows 10 of course, we would Azure register the device and use MAM in Intune/Endpoint Manager with Windows Information Protection. And of course on iPads, iPhones, and Android phones, there's app policies available too
 Obviously this is not something we can do with Mac. And as it's a BYOD laptop, we are not at liberty to lock the entire laptop down. Is there any sort of data protection policy or software we can use with Mac, or are we SOL? They're basically just going to be using Office and OneDrive
 Edit: I did find this from MS, which seems to offer some level of support, but as commenters have already stated, it's just a terrible idea and I'm going to strongly make that point

 Wondering if there are any recommendations fellow sys admins have when it comes to professional password managers for a team? We're only small but would ideally like all members of the team to have access to the same password vault for admin accounts etc. Doesn't need to be anything special, just easy to setup and use ideally.

 Of course, we in IT say that this must not be opened under any circumstances!
 ​
 I am a sysadmin, not a security specialist. Nevertheless, I (and my colleagues) are curious about what would happen if a potential virus is executed or a link is followed.
 ​
 To test something like this, we currently have an old notebook with Windows 7. The notebook is of course not in the domain and in a separate VLAN without access to the LAN.
 We would like to replace this notebook with a new one (more performance, Win10 etc.).
 ​
 Now to my question: do you have a special computer to test potential viruses, malware, phishing links etc.?
 If so, what is your configuration of the computer?
 ​
 - separate VLAN -> no access to the LAN
 - no domain join
 - Office installed
 - 7zip
 - Wireshark
 Have you created a way to reset the computer after running the file? Restore Point, Backup, Hyper-V or something else?
 ​
 The reason for this computer is primarily curiosity and to rule out any false positives.

 We had this issue on HP Elitebook 845 G7 and Elitebook 855 G7 but i think Elitebook 835 G7 will have this issue too.
 Since the release of Windows 11 we are Testing this new OS version in our environment. A clean install is working great an all policies are prepared. But every upgrade attempt from Windows 10 to Windows 11 ended in a Bluescreen. (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP)
 Because we had other project ongoing we have waited until Windows 11 22H2. Maybe the problem was solved in this release but we had the same issue. Both scenarios upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 22H2 and upgrade Windows 11 21H2 to 22H2.
 After this bad experience we created a case at the HP Support. After some troubleshooting and sending them our logs we have found the issue.
 It's the Synaptics touchpad driver. 
 When we remove the driver the upgrade is working fine. Now we wait for a response from HP if they will release a fixed driver.
 I will update this post when i receive some new information.

 we need a mail service like mailjet to do bulkmail.
 I would like to avoid using our primary domain for this, or set up a 2nd DKIM and SPF to coexist with our primary mail system, due to "i have a bad feeling about this".
 I guess because i don't want to jeopardize domain reputation, risk being blacklisted, or deal with the consequences of the mailservice being compromised. 
 Which is why i proposed to buy a new domain, with one or two mail accounts attached to it, for bulk mails only, without interfering with other productive mail services.
 A follow up question to this was:
 Would protective services like Microsofts Defender P1 or P2 (or other vendors) recognize those massmails as Phishing or Impersonation? Because there will be <a href> links and images within the body that point towards our primary domain, while the sender address would be from the new domain.
 I don't think that's the case, but since i'm stuck in the overthinking game now, i'm not so sure anymore. Anyone had to deal with this before?

 https://www.reddit.com/r/gpg4win/comments/y0y28b/command_line_encryptiondecryption/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 
 Hi, I'm relatively new to gpg4win, and am trying to accomplish what I *think* is a relatively simple task.
 I'd like to encrypt and decrypt files from a command line, such that I can script a process to automatically parse files in a folder to be encrypted at regular intervals, or decrypted. I have only one certificate with private key stored in Kleopatra, and it's set to my default identity, and "ultimate" trusted.
 I've googled for hours, read through documentation, found examples, but a few of the option switches that are widely referenced don't seem to work with gpg4win (IE, --passphrase-file or --passphrase_fl, or even just --passphrase).
 Here's my current syntax for a test encryption
 .\gpg -r "KEYNAME" -o testencrypt.gpg --pinentry-mode=loopback --passphrase "PASSPHRASE" --default-recipient-self --always-trust -encrypt test.txt
 yeilds :
 gpg: ypt: skipped: No public keygpg: test.txt: encryption failed: No public key
 I'm not sure if I even need the passphrase for encryption, rather than decryption - but if I omit --passphrase, it prompts for one.
 I haven't gotten to decryption syntax, but figure it will be pretty much just the opposite process. I noticed the gpg-preset-passphrase.exe program, and ran it and entered the password there - not sure if that impacts anything.
 Thanks for any insight!
 edit : using gpg4win 4.0.3

 Our plan is...
  
Use GPO to redirect our user folders (Desktop, Documents etc) to a windows file share using the in-built offline files feature.
 The share will be hosted on DFS and replicated between fileservers across regions.
 Configure folder quotas to prevent users running riot with local files
  
Does this sound like a bad idea?

 First question was : https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y06smj/sysadminsoftware_enginners_is_this_normal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
 I got another question, as i am wondering if this is a common practice which i have not experinced as i feel that it is a bad pratice, or am i wrong, 
 So for example, Customer creates a ticket, ticket gets assigned to wtv team i.e. Hardware team. Hardware team resolves the issues, comments on the ticket saying issue has been resolved, can we proceed to close the ticket, customer comments back about a quey on something that is not related the issue i.e. warranty status of the HD which we have to email the OEM and await their reply. Which will extend the SLA even though the main issue has been resolved. 
 Do you get the customer to create a new ticket or keep the ticket open?
 For me i think it is a bad practice to keep the ticket open, from my experience usually we'd get the customer to create a new ticket. 
 But then again, back then i was working for companies had some of control i.e. HPE, big IT corps. 
 But the new company i just joined, i am still getting used to the practice, and i was wondering if i should address this as this might give the customer too much power to dictate and of course my previous question
 I find such practices bad and is making things very confusing which in turn would reduce productivity.
 ​
 Am i wrong?
 Or should i address this? 
 I dont wanan address something that would shoot myself in the foot

Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

The two commands both accept every VLAN configured on the switch on the trunk ports. So my question is, if there are any disadvantages for network, when the trunks are configured in that way instead of specifying the exact VLANs. We have some delays and higher TTLs in our network and/or some black magic we can't figure out. So my boss hat the opinion its caused by the trunk all command. Is that true? We are talking about a VLAN configuration of 20-30 VLANs.

 Today, something odd happened. We noticed that old users account that were once deleted now appeared back in AD. To add to this, a bunch of users that were removed from security groups for licensing purposes, were also suddenly added back to those sec groups. The MSP had dropped the ball on doing back ups for the last few months and we noticed a couple weeks ago and they have been working to get their crap together. So they have been in and out of the network working on this. 
 I’m not entirely sure what happened and why Active Directory suddenly looks like old stuff is there and/or reverted in some way or idk, cause it’s not reverted in its entirety. 
 What are some events or things I can look at in AD to help determined what happened here???

 ​
 Would really appreciate some help with AD delegation please?
 ​
 with a delegated user,
 I'm having a problem where, if I keep a users password as is, (for test purposes) and untick the box that says user must change password at next logon, the password is changed successfully.
 But if I access the account tab in ADUC, I still see the "user must change password at logon" box is ticked.
 If I untick and ok, I get that access is denied.
 ​
 what I've done thus far,
 I've created an OU, put some users in it and created a group to whom I'd like to delegate the permissions of change, reset password, read and write lockout time, read-write pwd last reset
 I've also added read and write user account control, but I'm not having any luck.
 ​
 Your help would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 Just trying to get a client up with Starlink - we are using tunnels to deliver their public IP and starlink as a backhaul - this all works fine.
 Deployment testing internally - we just setup a dhcp server and added routes based on DHCP like so:
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 dhcp 100
 And a few other routes back to management IP's in case of tunnel issues
 ip route 1.2.3.4 255.255.255.255 dhcp 100
 This worked in testing with normal DHCP server, but what we've found since deploying is that starlink's IPoE doesn't deliver a default route via the 'dhcp' keyword - i.e. DHCP Option 3 (I believe) and is instead providing the default static route via classless routes (option 121) ?
 The big tell is that a default route is there, but its 254 distance instead of the configured 100, and the /32 routes we added do not get picked up.
 So my question is thus - given we can not get that gateway using the 'dhcp' keyword on the routes, is there any way to kind of add a route for the /32's based on the default route given out in what we assume is option 121?
 I am remote to the site, so can't really reliably debug DHCP without kicking my access off, so any help is appreciated to understand my options.
 Thanks!

 I have a data network that is roughly 75 drops. The installer mixed the runs for voice and data. So each cable is terminated into two jacks, 2 pair for data, 2 pair for voice. Nothing is labeled, and my toner does not seem to work with these mixed cable runs. The toner tests out fine on a standard patch cable.
 Do I need a different\better toner or is this expected on cables terminated this way?

 Next time I'll encourage a customer power cycle before our maintenance window begins. We do have larger customers with scheduled reboots and monitoring via zabbix if it's been too long with reboots queued but this is a smaller division.
 Just a quick sanity check, I have vm console access, I couldn't have chosen 'shutdown without updates' without credentials, correct?
 My other choice would have been to have them shut it down from inside OS, and patch when it came up instead.

 edit: the therapeutic power of bitching and moaning made the box relinquish it's hold on my time. 2.2TB to migrate and hopefully up by start of business.

 Is there something glaring about Juniper that I'm missing? On paper Junos seems to tick the right boxes of not being a monolithic kernel, linux-based, EVPN/VXLAN support, SDN management and they've been around for decades. I'm getting my talking points together to talk with management about it, but I "don't know what I don't know" so I'm hoping reddit can educate me as to if there is something in production with this gear's operation that someone with tribal knowledge would know. Could definitely use some career advice as, the only downside I see is having to learn something new but I could be way off base. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Having a bit of a problem driving me nuts and hoping someone can lend a bone.
 I've done a similiar setup before and never had any trouble.
 I have two physical sites with an ESX host in each. All networking machines are inside of ESX. There is a virtual firewall at each site. The two have a Site2Site VTI (Route based) VPN Tunnel between them. Over it I'm sending VXLan traffic. The VxLan endpoint is behind each of the firewalls, running OpnSense in another VM. No NAT going on inside the VTI. Subnet to subnet. VxLan link is established and I have a stretched layer 2 segment with the IP range of 10.20.171.0/24. I can ping across it. I can browse http across it. But the second I swap the same test/set of ips for https - I'm unable to browse. In other words, I believed that it is a TLS problem. curl -k -vvv showed it hanging on "Client Hello".
 ​
 Using the same http host I succeeded with but https did not work with, I did a client side wireshark twice:
  
On Net
 Across VxLink
  
For #1, it worked (ie: the vms live next to each other on the same time).
 For #2, last thing client sends is a tls "client hello" and never receives the server hello back.
 I did another wire shark on the server side, and the server hello IS being sent back, just not arriving at back at the client. OVER THE SAME LINK that plain old http (stateful) and icmp work.
 I'm absolutely dizzy trying to chase the packets for that particular conversation at this stage. 
 Can anyone think of anything?

This is a brownfield deployment, so we have lots of workloads that are already talking to each other and we need to do some kind of discovery to determine what's talking to what on what ports.
 VMware's solution is to pay a lot of money for vRealize Network Insight. I'm balking partly on the cost and partly on the principle of the thing.... lots of firewall products have this visibility for no extra cost once you buy the product.
 Anyone have suggestions for alternative approaches?

When working with the vendor, their recommendation is to turn this off or make our customers who are receiving these emails whitelist the vendors domain.

 1) move systems to a different account receivable software that will sending information 
 2) email all customers to whitelist the domain
 3) turn off DMARC quarantine option.

 Personally I don't think 3 is an option but my direct manager wanted it there. I am leaning strongly towards 1 if the vendor cannot find a way to sending this in a secure fashion. Any helpful tips?

It’s the same on both Nexuses, they both think they’re learning it from the other device. We can’t clear it out of the mac table because it’s a static (it will only let you clear dynamic), and when checking the running config on both devices there are no static MAC’s assigned to any interfaces. 
 Has anyone seen this issue before, or found a resolution? 
 TLDR: both our nexuses think they’re learning a static mac from the other side via the vPC peer link, but there is no static mac configured.

We currently have WAN links (fiber LES) to the building but the connection is sometimes problematic, and only 1gbit when its working at its best. We are going to be moving our entire office to the building so to ease this transition we want to link back to the original office with the fastest link we can reasonably set up without spending mad amounts of cash.
 We have looked at possibly using the Unifi UBB-XG https://dl.ui.com/ds/ubb-xg_ds.pdf But its not clear if this is encrypted and/or secure. Regular raw wifi isnt an option in our setup, and laying a VPN over the top means a lot of reconfiguration of routing etc. Ideally we want to extend our broadcast domain over the wifi (not ideal but its only short term) to avoid having to reconfigure all the equipment. Also the speed appears to only be ~6gbit on a good day, despite it having 10gbit SPF+ ports.
 Can anyone suggest a better option? Preferably someone with some experiential knowledge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. I’m having kind of a dilemma here. We are trying to achieve network segmentation with port security at our work but there is something I just can’t seem to grasp on how to fix.
 We want to use 802.1x on all access switch ports, the problem is that we use different vlans for difference devices. So printers in VLAN20, clients in VLAN10 etcetera. I want to somehow push the VLAN through authorization policies so that users can move printers without having them stop functioning.
 I want to know what we can do about this in an event where the ISE goes down completely. I know that you can revert to a specified VLAN if the radius server goes dead. But I want that for every VLAN we use. 
 Is that even possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We're considering to buy few new DC Internet Edge routers, we need them just for routing, no need MPLS or segment routing, or other 'fancy' features, currently we're using Cisco NCS-5501-SE. But it has only 4x100G ports, which is not sufficient. So we started to look to other options:
 Cisco NCS55A1-24H - it has 24x100G, but limited scale - supports only ~2.2millions of prefixes. The maximum could be reached in a few next years. So this is not very good. Filter all /24 prefixes would be a workaround for future, but it could bring some new un expected problems, so we're looking very carefully to this.
 Cisco NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S - It has 36x100G with Extended scale for prefixes - support 4millions of prefixes, but seems too expensive.
 Maybe you know so other models would be not so expensive as NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S ? Maybe something from Juniper series ? I think every DC operator with quite much internet traffic are having similar head ache these days. Any advices ? Thanks !

 Thoughts? Suggestions?
 My firewall SLA's use Packet Loss, Latency and Jitter to determine best connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had this discussion and it reminded me that I wanted to raise this point here.
 My current team lead gifted me with this concept - the turd system. A 'turd' is a task that shouldn't exist, doesn't make sense to exist in its current form, and is a pain in the ass to handle, especially in bulk. Turds tends to naturally accumulate into heaps of shit, until either some poor responsible souls goes shovel them, or they get stomped down the drain.
 My team lead is of the firm beliefs that it's a good thing for turds to accumulate, as this triggers the 'turd system' - someone eventually complains that the turds aren't being passed in a timely fashion, and after a few iterations this provides the impetus to restructure or remove the task so as to eliminate the source of turds.
 This strikes me as something that is typical of organizations in general. Dumb shit creates work no one wants to do it, least of all the people who realize it's pointless. If someone handles it, that process never gets reviewed. However, if it's left to break, then eventually decision-makers will resign themselves to changing the process.
 Does your shop have a turd system too?

 Normally a firewall with stateful inspection allows outbound traffic to return unless explicitly denied.
 I have a policy configured with the following rules:
 Mandatory
  
Log all connections - Monitor only
 Allow specific applications
 Block 'very high risk' applications.
 Geoblocking rule
  
Default
  
Allow traffic inside zone to outside zone and inspect.
  
Default Action: Access Control: Block all traffic.
 However, most return traffic is still being blocked on the outside ingress.
 What is the proper way to configure such a policy for a perimeter FPR?

 We are building a collapsed core topology with our 4 sites (30m apart from eachother)
 The site in the middle has two HA firewalls and each site will have a ring design in the access layer. Each site will also have a l3 switch for inter-vlan routing, connected to the firewall in the middle.
 I am wondering if the l3 switches are even needed since the routing between vlans could be accomplished directly via the firewalls?

AzureAD > Security > Identity Protection > Multifactor Authentication Registration policy
  
This is not configurable, all of the options are grayed out (I'm signed in with a Global admin account). Not sure why I can't edit anything, the default policy does not let me change the assigned users/groups, all grayed out.
 
 
Using a conditional access policy seems to work, forced my account to sign out and register a phone number (also had phone call and the app as options).
  
When I go into the test user's Azure Profile > Authentication Methods, it's empty. When I worked a support role, I'd see the registered phone number there which could be cleared, or changed. Has this been moved? The "new" menu (blue ribbon at the top stating the "new authentication experience) doesn't have anything either
 
I also can't seem to specify methods, I'd like to remove phone call as an option, and possibly remove text as well to force the authenticator app, as I've come to understand text is rather not secure, and the authenticator app seems to be generally regarded as a good method. Would this be done through the menu I mentioned in the first issue, the registration policy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[External email tagging has been available in OWA, Outlook mobile, and Outlook for Mac since 2021. The most awaited support for "Outlook for Windows" is available now.
 In phishing attacks, attackers send emails pretending to be trusted persons or organizations. To prevent users from clicking malicious links and attachments sent by external users, admins can enable an external email warning tag in Outlook. It helps Outlook users handle those emails with extra attention. 
 Now admins can switch from the transport rule as it has few disadvantages,
  
It takes up a lot of space in the subject line, making it hard to preview the subject.
 As the transport rule might not be aware of the end user’s language, it leads to localization issues.
 Multiple external tags: If the external users keep replying to the thread, it will add multiple [External] tags in the subject.
 When you reply to the external email, they won't get any clue that you have enabled external tagging.
  
Admins can enable it through PowerShell. Start enabling external email tagging to alert users, irrespective of device usage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few days ago, we discussed the newly-released grant control that helps us to apply phishing-resistant MFA.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xxy1hl/apply_this_new_phishingresistant_mfa_setting_to/
 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

 ​
 We have two domains: CompanyA.local and CompanyB.local
 ​
 We have also a file server companyA.local
 ​
 The users from the domain CompanyB.local want to access the shared folders.
 ​
 ​
 also , how about file server permission procedure?
 ​
 This environment has two domains involved in a trust relationship. So both sides can authenticate to the other.

 Thank for your help!

 https://fkeep.io/imgs/i/ptbR.jpg

 Basically, I want the vouchers to be usable up to X HOURS based on actual use and not when the voucher was activated (which forces the user to use it up all the moment it's activated).
 Say user one is issued an 8 hour voucher
 User can use it for a total of 8 hours worth meaning that the user can disconnect from portal when he's done browsing online for the moment, in order to have more time to browser online later.
 In the future, I would also need to generate some vouchers that will expire based on when it was first activated (used).
 But basically, I can't tell which is which.

 I like to use windows terminal, and I like it to default to wsl when opening. 
 But I'm using winget more and more, and so I also would like to have a different shortcut that will open windows terminal directly in power shell. To achieve so I've created a shortcut with parameters like so:
 "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_1.15.2524.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\wt.exe" -p "Windows PowerShell" 
 As you can see the path to windows terminal executable will change at every new update, breaking my shortcut. Taking the time to fix the shortcut every time is not worth the hassle.
 Do anyone knows how to create a dynamic shortcut that will handle the continuous change in the path? I was thinking something like this:
 "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_*\wt.exe" -p "Windows PowerShell" 
 But of course it will not work

I think that besides the basic SNMP theory, I will give some Net-SNMP examples first and then dig into an NMS.
 My instructor has given me two NMSs to choose from: Nagios core and Zenoss core.
 Which NMS would be better to use for creating lab exercises, which are intended to give a basic concept of network management. Should I even pick one or rather use both?
 I have Nagios Cookbook and Zenoss Core Network and system Administration as my source material for both NMSs.

 or turn one into a switch and connect it to the second router via lan cable. (with the process, i think i wont be able to access the services of both routers.
 Or i can get a third old router, turn it into a switch and connect the two routers to it. AM not sure if the 3rd rout/switch would be able to broadcast a wifi with the two wifis merged.
 Is it possible to do so or to do routing in a router/switch?

 its a thought experiment. Glad for any suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Friends, 
 Can you please help clarify following doubts?
  
In OSPF, While forwarding a received Type5 LSA to other area, why does the ABR not change the Advertising Router IP of the Type 5 LSA to it's own IP? What is te basic reason behind this? If ABR is able to change the Advertising Router's IP in the Type5 LSA, then there was no need of Type 4 LSA which meant less OSPF overhead on the network.
 BGP Split Horizon Rule says, "Don't advertise IBGP learned routes to another IBGP peer." The purpose is to avoide loop because as per standard, it is assumed that all of the IBGP Peers will be on full mesh connectivity. - What is the reason that the BGP Protocol designers made this standard assumption?
 Why is does the Route Reflector not change the next hop IP while advertising an IBGP learned route to client? I am trying to understand what made the BGP designers decide for RR to not change the next Hop IP for IBGP learned routes?
 What is the reason due to which BGP designers did not consider EBGP router to automatically change Next Hop IP for EBGP learned routes while advertising towards IBGP Peers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 I'm hoping someone can shed some light before I go a little crazy.
 I know others have also had this problem as I've seen threads, but everyones is slightly different.
 2019 environment running RDS (With FSLogix) (Hosted in a DC)
 365 Apps for Enterprise - Shared License (E3)
 Back in May/June - all users received an activation issue - office wouldn't activate at all
 Microsoft pushed me around, placing registries keys like EnableADAL and DisableADALatopWAMOverride then it started to work but I didn't really want to use either of these keys long term... I was also advised to use: AlwaysUseMSOAuthForAutoDiscover=1 but I haven't removed this key as of yet.
 We continued to have problems for the months with Activation (not licensed) or 'these set of folders can't be opened'
 The main fix after a lot of research seemed to have been the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin was missing/corrupted. I've been able to mostly fix this with a logon script that checks + reinstall with the following:
 if (-not (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin)) { Add-AppxPackage -Register "$env:windir\SystemApps\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\Appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode -ForceApplicationShutdown } Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin 
 For the most part, this script has fixed the daily problems but occasionally, for different people, randomly when they logon in the morning, they won't be able to open Outlook as it'll say 'these set of folders can't be opened' - AAD BrokerPlugin is installed and the main fix is to open Word, go to File > Accounts > Sign out and then sign straight back in. You can then open Outlook straight away - it's a frustrating little resolution.
 Has this else experienced this too? Anyone able to provide some insight or suggestions for a final fix?
 Thanks!

 We have a hybrid Exchange 2016 organisation. I finished migrating the last mailbox to exchange online. I have updated MX records and autodiscover (now pointing to EXO). We keep AD on prem.
 A the moment firewall port 25, 80 and 443 are still forwarded to our on prem mailserver. 
 The purpose of migrating to exchange online was to avoid the vulnerabilities of exchange on prem.
 So how can I disable OWA, and all unnecessary access from WAN to our exchange server?
 Do the ports still need to be forwarded? I read that some are necessary for AD connect?

 This is my only client using load balancing & I can’t find anything online for this but I’m certain this is due to the load balancing on his sever.

 We're taking part in this years Gone Phishing Tournament and have gone through the setup process as instructed. The test email came through, bypassing the mail server filters and I uploaded a list of all users as instructed.
 This morning, I get an email from an end user saying they had received an email over the weekend about a "Gone Phishing Tournament". It appears they have been sent the same initial setup instructions that I received in September. A quick message trace shows that everyone in the company has received the same setup email! So now this tournament is no longer a surprise to anyone and has basically been ruined. 
 Has this happened to anyone else? I've contacted their support team and await their reply. I've looked back through the instructions and at no point does it say the uploaded user list will receive this email.

 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

 I've got a few logical networks at the office. Internal LAN/Ethernet, Phones/VOIP, Internal Wifi, Guest Wifi, pretty basic). For the network equipment I have a firewall/router appliance, two managed switches, and three wireless access points. 
 Should I have one interface port on the Firewall appliance configured as a trunk for each of the logical networks setup as VLANs? Or would splitting wired and wireless device types into their own switches, each connected to a dedicated interface on the appliance be the better choice?
 What are the pros & cons, and which would give me better or worse performance? Is either approach sound?

We have several (like 10) synology NAS devices in the network for our backup solution. Veeam backs up to these devices. Can anyone give me a good reason these are not ready for enterprise setup? To me they are just a solution thats not really expensive, but maybe not the ideal solution. 
 I have had a 3rd party in our stuff saying X is wrong or Y is wrong and so far its been things that are not actually a big deal. Example: They complained about the m.2 drives the NAS uses as not being enterprise. (The m.2 is simply a cache drive). They have also been looking at the network side of things and making, honestly dumb suggestions. Dumb as in replacing our backbone with a different manufacturer for network hardware.

 I have some questions I want to ask. The hosts are going to have 2x1G and 2x10G nics with the 10G being used for storage. 
 I'm trying to figure out what TOR switch I should use. I'm also trying to figure out if I should do all the routing on the TOR switch and even do the bgp sessions on said switch or should I just trunk the uplink to its own router and a firewall behind it. I have a xeon d host where I was planning on virtualizing most network functions.
 I'm probably not going to be able to afford any brand new high end switch so used switch recommendations are highly welcome.

 Basically in one of our servers We got an alert about the CMOS battery
 I contacted IBM with the logs and they sent me a CMOS battery
 I managed to finally remove the old CMOS battery and insert this new one 
 However the CMOS battery bay holder is lose
 The CMOS battery bay in the server 
 ibm 3550 m5 
 Sits like this 
 https://i.postimg.cc/5053cmm0/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-23-48-027-edit-com-android-chrome.jpg
 And the CMOS battery bay that seems lose has these plastic things as shown below
 https://i.postimg.cc/gkjv4p1r/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-15-52-984-edit-com-miui-gallery.jpg
 that holds it ( it is NOT soldered to the board ) when I was trying to clip off the last battery I may have losened it
 Now when I plugged the new battery in the IBM server ImM console gives the same error saying something about a faulty battery so my questions are
 @ the server boots up and is functional without any noises and when the new CMOS battery was inserted it changed the IBM IMM time date to 1999 - does this mean anything ?
 @ also do I have to replace the whole motherboard or the CMOS battery being lose could it be a problem ? I mean it's placed fine - or could I tighten it from the back ? 
 @ does anyone know what the problem is ?
 Thanks !

Right now we're using Mikrotik but its so unstable that we decides to get a more better device with limited budget. Any advise what device that should we acquired ? We're needs some device that can do traffic engineering and VPLS , capable to the fast reroute on OSPF, and running P/PE roles. Throughput right now is approximately 3-5Gbps, but seems we also need advise to if our traffic reaches 10Gbps between site. Thanks before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I have some networking knowledge and experience, but I am still growing my skills and advancing my career. 
 I was thinking about how layer 3 switching for interVLAN routing is more efficient and quicker due to the ASICs and such for routing traffic between VLANs compared to a standard firewall with inspection and such. But layer 3 switching ACLs are very basic and doesn't allow any sort of traffic inspection/analysis. 
 Firewalls have all the great security features for traffic inspection and analysis, but can the bottleneck/slower for interVLAN routing to internal systems.
 One scenario I can think of is; lets say you have a media department (10+ people) that works with a lot of large files and directly edits off a network share through a 10gb link connected to their desktops. Using a firewall to separate the server network and their desktop network (as well as all the other standard user networks) may be the bottleneck when it comes to those connections but more secure for internal threats. Layer 3 switching would be faster, but way less security to defend against internal threats as well as more complicated to maintain with ACLs the larger the distribution layer grows. Or is this just a money problem and a beefier firewall should be purchased to handle something like this?
 I guess the question is, at what point do you choose firewall or layer 3 switch for interVLAN routing and ensuring the network is properly secure and why?

One of our network engineers noticed a lot of Broadcast (ARP) traffic with the info stating "Who has <internal IP>? Tell <Orion IP>". Does SolarWinds Orion normally behave like that in a corporate network? I sort of get the idea that it might, but it seems excessive the amount of broadcast traffic we are seeing at any given point, even if we aren't doing discoveries at that point.

 so I have this one client who wants to migrate from O365 to Google Workspace (reason is not important). Circa 50 users.
 I already tried all the tools that Google recommend for migrating from O365 but NONE of them worked and the documentation is DOG SHIT. The only way I was able to migrate a mailbox (test mail) was manual process by making a content search on O365 and uploading the PST file to Gmail. I need to automate the migration and I am now thinking if I should rather just create my own migrating tool with powershell/C# and use Google/Graph REST apis... but that could potentially scale the price 3 times the initial budget.
 Has anyone here migrated from O365 to Google workspace (Gmail primarily)? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 So, I will need your help on this one.
 I have users that work on company laptops (ad-joined), they log in using their AD credentials as Standard Users.
 When they work from home, they connect to the company VPN. However, if they won't connect to VPN, their credentials are cached on the laptop so they can still log in to their account.
 Sometimes, let's assume that the VPN connection is broken, I want to remotely configure a setting or two (via Anydesk) using a local administrator account without being connected to the VPN. Not being connected to VPN means that I cannot grant a user local admin rights to overcome this.
 How can I configure a local admin account (maybe with cached creds) so that I can still support these remote users? Actually, what I am asking is the best practice covering both security and ease of access, how are you guys implementing a similar case?
 I should mention that we are not using LAPS or any other Endpoint Privilege Management software, we are considering this scenario though.

 Is there a better way to achieve the same result? This way feels outdated, but I can't seem to think of a better answer.

 ls of my users root directly would hang until ctrl+c
 tab autocomplete when used in home directory would hang and lock up the shell
 other random issues which turned out to be things trying to look in the home directory 
 turns out its the windows 11 RDP bug causing an issue with XRDP and the thinclient_drives directory causes this unusual behaviour. 
 disabling the UDP part of the rdp client on the windows box solves the issue.
 more info on the issue that seems to cause this behaviour here:
 https://pureinfotech.com/windows-11-22h2-bug-remote-desktop/ 
 there may be a way to block the issue server side too but I havent looked
 this had me going around in circles for a bit as linking "ls" not working on linux server to a windows rdp client problem was unexpected... 
 although probably an edge case of using rdp to connect to a linux box I figured I would drop this here just in case someone is pulling their hair out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Either I’m having a brain fart or it actually has to be setup this way. 
 We have around 500+ street cabinets all providing FTTP to residential properties. The business will be rolling out open gear to provide out of band console access to each and every cab. 
 From what I’ve been told for the rollout the open gear has cellular connectivity and will run an IPSec tunnel back to the DC. Now, in my mind that means we’ll have 500+ IPSec tunnels terminating on the firewall. That’s a heck of a lot of tunnels, is this a typical deployment for OpenGear or is there a better way I’m just not seeing?

 so in the experience section where we put our projects and all, HR and recruiters insist on in addition to the thing you do you also should add and quantify the impact of what you did in other words the added value of the project, I totally understand this but as network engineers how we can quantify this?
 for example, let's say that I deployed the X firewall in the Y company or I configured a VPN between the main site and the secondary site how can I quantify and measure the added value/impact for these projects? if we take let's say a digital marketing agent he can just say that he did the X marketing campaign that increased traffic by Y% to the client's website or increased sales by Z amount, i cant figure out how to have a similar take for network engineering?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there. First time post long time lurker.
 My general question is this: When should I generally start looking at migrating over to the sysadmin side?
 I always find it hard to determine when to move up due to the incessant voice in the back of my head telling me I don't know enough yet. Basically just looking to get outside opinions on if its time to move onwards and upwards. 
 My experience is as follows:
 3 years government contractor service desk
 2.5 years MSP work as a "engineer" but still basically a t2 service desk that handled everything that could be remotely done
 Currently at a top backup solutions company as a support engineer for about a year
 Salary is around 65k currently so im only slightly lower than the sys admin range already for my area
 Certs:
 Windows operation system fundamentals
 Fortinet NSE 1-3
 Cloud +
 Could pass Security+ in about a week or 2 
 Any opinions helpful and feel free to remove if this isnt the right place for this but just looking for some help!

 Also tried to cast from company laptop to a microsoft wirelessdisplay adapter, same issue.

 Have read items about GPOs, but so far I've found no GPO affecting wireless settings that would block miracast (allow creation of public profiles, uncheck "don't allow wifi-direct groups")
 ​
 Tried a brand new pc and installed to it the web proxy, antivirus, firewalls, etc.. and it still seems to connect fine. So something to the other pcs is causing the connection to block but can't pin point anything.
 ​
 Checked on Event viewer, wlan autoconfig log and I do see it starts and connects and then stops it, but nothing telling anything as to why it's doing it.
 ​
 Anybody ran into anything similar?
 ​
 Company just built new state of the art facilities with lots of TVs and well this will look terribly on me unable to cast laptop display on these screens. I've put HDMI on some, but I know it's just convenient to do the miracast. 
 ​
 Tried an HDMI wireless transmitter, that works, but image quality sucks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In packet-switching networks, there exist four types of delays:
  
Processing delay
 Queuing delay
 Propagation delay
 Transmission delay
  
Are these delays due to the implementation of the store-and-forward flow control?
 And if another flow control (like cut-through switching or worm-hole switching) doesn't that affect these kinds of latency?
 For example (according to my understanding) in cut-through switching the processing delay is almost eliminated if not at all.

I was chatting with him via text to say hi and asking him about the job, etc. He mentioned they don't use NAT and that all the devices are assigned public IPs, which he also said are all behind a firewall. I replied with concern and confusion and he just said that the college was issued a /16 block back in the early Internet days and that they've just been using those. We didn't really chat much more but I was wondering about this. 
 Wouldn't this be a massive security concern as well as a massive waste of public IP addresses? Also, how would you be behind a firewall and also be using public IPs without NAT unless your router/firewall was right at the ISP level? 
 I'm assuming I'm missing something here so I figured I'd ask for some insight in this sub.

 I do not see the need for these roles to be added to the service account to remove another point of attack but unsure of any repercussions that may happen if removed.

 As far as I see all the service account needs is to have the owner role for the Azure stuff that is separate from administrating anything related to AD Azure or O365 but want a second thought.

 Question I am really asking is about Googles decision to charge for 4k video. Is Google having to pay extra for the incremental bandwidth to the ISP exchange sites? Don't they just turn up an additional lambda on a link to deliver more bandwidth from their Datacenters \ Edge centers to the ISP exchange? 
 I am assuming they are using 10 of the 16 lambdas that their gear has available, and they just need to increase to the 11th lambda, and there is no cost for that incremental lambda.
 Obviously when they need to bring up an additional fiber link, and activate a full port and pay the full freight for that link.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing a lab research where for the same topology I have a configuration for the IS-IS point-to-point and OSPF point-to-point protocols. I measure the network convergence time (not in the event of a failure, but in what time from the moment of starting the network the convergence is achieved, of course, excluding the times of starting the router) and the lower time results are achieved by IS-IS. I can't understand why this is happening, because to my knowledge both protocols calculate the route with the same SPF algorithm, and in the point-to-point setting both skip the DR/BDR and DIS selection step. Research is done on the same equipment, repeated many times, the trend is always the same. Could someone explain where the better result for IS-IS might be coming from?

 I hope everyone is doing well this weekend. 
 First time posting on reddit and here, we have a hypervisor in which we are going to repurpose into a file server using TrueNAS. 
 The server motherboard is: X9QR7-TF+
 I would like to know if I can perform a firmware upgrade so that IPMI uses HTML 5 instead of Java, I can't seem to find any information on it and I was wondering if anyone else has the answer? 
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I apologize if this post is against the rules. I'm not asking for support. I'm wanting to either confirm or deny a perception I've made.
 It seems like Windows can occasionally become erratic in small ways until I install pending updates. This can be anything from weirdness with a mouse being difficult to control to losing internet connection on a single machine seemingly at random. Other devices are fine. What has me pointing to Windows updates specifically is that even though my apps, test pings, etc. all return error responses Windows update can sure as shit download updates and install them no problem.
 These usually go away with the handy dandy restart as well (even if I don't install the updates yet) but crop up soon again before long. I've noticed this for years and ran into it again today (the no internet issue specifically) and finally thought to ask. Between these periods my experience is pretty good until they happen again and quite usually there are pending updates. Rinse and repeat. It's not even an every time thing though quite often I am prompt about installing them once I notice the icon. Occasionally when I'm not though is when I've noticed this behavior.
 What gives? Am I mixing correlation/causation? It's hard to imagine Windows having poison pill code to prod users into installing updates, but honestly it wouldn't surprise me either.
 Edit: Thank god I'm not alone. 🙏

Client B gateway address is connected to the Client A's network interface.
 Client B is running a Web browser which is sending requests to 127.0.0.1:1234 HTTP Proxy, which encrypts and sends the packets ahead to Client A's machine then to -> ISP -> Public Internet.
 
  
By what means could it be possible for Client A's machine to sniff or intercept the unencrypted<>decrypted packets between Client B's web browser and the HTTP proxy on 0.0.0.0:1234? Means such as firewall turned off on B, open ports on B, attaching a listener, promiscuous mode, DHCP, or any kind of poisoning, or any other way?
 How can this be done?

 I got it working. For some reason opnsense did not like using only tagged VLANS on an interface. Once I chose and setup one of the VLANS to be untagged, I could setup all others as tagged. 
  
I've been trying to get a little lab setup using two Zyxel GS1900-XX switches. It works fine if using just the main (GS-1900-24) switch. But no go if using a port on the office (GS1900-16) switch. It seems that VLAN 5 (LAB VLAN) is not traversing the link between the two switches (port 24 on main switch & port 15 on office switch), although VLAN 1 does just fine.
 If I plug my laptop into port 5 on the main switch (untagged VLAN 5), it successfully pulls a DHCP address from the VLAN 5 interface on my router connected to the main switch (ports 3-4, LAGG, tagged VLAN 5).
 If I try to plug the laptop into any of the 6 x VLAN 5 ports (ports 1-6, untagged on office switch) it will not pull a DHCP address and cannot ping the VLAN 5 router interface (10.71.17.254) if I set the address manually.
 I am including screenshots of all applicable switch and router settings.
 I would really appreciate any help I could get from you fine people.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I set out to implement syncing with cloud-hosted Snipe-It, I wanted a solution flexible enough to deal with possible problems in the source data. The result is a set of PowerShell scripts utilizing snazy2000's excellent SnipeitPS module ( https://github.com/snazy2000/SnipeitPS). The main premise is flexibility, working off cache wherever possible, and creating and assigning entities in snipe-it when needed (departments, companies, locations, etc.). The scripts can be found on github at https://github.com/mattcarras/SnipeItSyncPS.
 Quick tidbits about each script:
 - SnipeIt-Sync-PS.ps1: The main API script, which is dot-sourced by the other two scripts. Requires snazy2000's SnipeitPS module.
 - SnipeIt-AD-Sync.ps1: Complete script for syncing user information from AD. Syncs the SID to the EmployeeNum field by default for greater flexibility. Supports all fields supported by SnipeitPS, including syncing info about departments, companies, and managers, as well as setting groups. Also supports flagging or deleting users which no longer exist in AD. Should work with minimal changes. Also technically supports updating passwords, it's recommended to use SSO instead.
 - SnipeIt-Asset-Sync.ps1: Script for syncing asset information from previously exported CSV, direct from SCCM via WMI, direct from AD, or direct WMI queries. You will need to set the fields in each function to match whatever you're importing.
 Hopefully the scripts may prove useful in some way. Feel free to build your own syncing solution using parts or all of the API. And while the scripts are currently being used in an enterprise environment without issue, feel free to submit bug reports on github if you encounter any problems.

 I have a Dell M1000e with 4 M630 blades with Intel X710 10Gb network adapters and a single M8024-k in slot A1. I cannot seem to get any of the blades to connect at 10Gb/s, they all negotiate to 1Gb/s.
 I have one blade running Ubuntu Server 20.04, and three running Windows Server 2019. None of them will negotiate the 10Gb/s link. The Ubuntu box gives me an option to force the link to 10Gb/s but it loses connection, and the Windows ones provide no configuration for it.
 I have also tried forcing the connected switch ports to 10Gb/s for the blades (also tested with forcing it on the Ubuntu blade) to no avail.
 The M1000e has the v1.1 midplane, the switch has been upgraded to the latest firmware, and I've installed the latest intel drivers on the windows blades.
 I also have another 10Gb/s switch and a 10Gb/s NAS plugged in to the external SFP+ ports and both of those negotiate 10Gb/s without issue.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

 We’re managing Chrome updates via Intune policy (the old method with OMA-URI components). Found that several user groups weren’t being governed by this policy and added them. Now I’m potentially in some dire straits…
 Some users who had newer versions than what we needed to use had their Chrome installs rolled back to the assigned version. When this happened, is basically reset the browser to zero - all bookmarks, passwords, auto fill data, etc. is gone. I verified by doing it to my computer that you can restore the data if you were signed into a Google account before the reset (sign back in and turn on sync).
 However, if a user wasn’t signed into a Google account before their browser was reset, does anyone know if there is any way to restore this data short of a full system rollback?

 We struggle to keep a lid on subscriptions and cloud resources for our tiny organization. Large companies (and government!) are probably oversubscribed massively.
 ​
 Since inception, one of the top reasons to "go cloud" was the flexibility of ramping up and down as the business climate dictates. Now many organizations don't even have a handle on their cloud spend. It's going to be almost impossible to cut back on these expenditures.

Recently, when starting the computer do not get into the network. Only some do not find the network. And it may be that this does not occur every day. We have a DHCP server which distributes the IP addresses. Sometimes computers just don't get an IP address and they get a default IP and are not in the domain because they can't find the DNS and DHCP server. The workaround is when you unplug the network cable and plug it back in or turn the PC off and on again. Both does not always work and you have to test which variant works. Of the 250 computers, not always the same computers are affected, but different ones. Now my consideration is to give each computer a fixed IP address, there is otherwise no solution. Is it usual with a company size to give the computers fixed IP addresses? Or is a DHCP server the better choice? Sorry for my bad english

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a Citrix environment with Server 2019 servers. We would like to have our users Outlook mailboxes indexed and be able to roam this index between the Citrix servers. We use O365/Exchange Online so the mailboxes are in cached mode. We are using Citrix UPM for handling the user profiles, and FSLogix Office Containers for handling the cached ost-files.
 ​
 Everything seems to be working fine, except the fact that the search index for Outlook does not seem to work. We are letting Server 2019 handle the search database - not UPM or FSLogix - as per MS recommendation. We can see that the per-user database (.edb file) is created in the user profiles. However, they do not seem to update and the size of the .edb files never increases from the initial size of 8196 KB. 
 When we look at the indexing status in Outlook, it shows that Outlook is a location that should be indexed, but it also shows that 0 items have been indexed. And it shows that 0 items are still needed to be indexed. 
 On a normal Windows 10 PC with Outlook it shows how many items have been indexed. And I've read somewhere that the size of the per-user database .edb should increase, when indexing large mailboxes. 
 So what is your experience - is it normal that Outlook shows 0 items indexed? To me this indicates that something is not right? And should't the size of the .edb in the user profile increase, when indexing large mailboxes (10-15 GB ost-files)? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I recently got a used LTO-7 for quite a bargain - almost for free so no hard feelings here.
 Its IBM FC HH drive, connected via FC 8gb qlogic qle2562 to server, put in a BDT Flexstor II (oem tl2000/ts3100/msl2024...) 24 slot library
 The drive however acts a bit strange. When booting up everything is ok, no errors, no faults, no lights...
 The drive passes ITDT health test with all passed. Since i only use lto6 at home i also only tested lto6. Speed it does in health test is 151 mb/s, not full 160, but no failure either.
 I then started full write test. That fails after about 1 hour with EC 6 in ITDT and F3 01 SCD 5 Dtive broken on the library. Wont accept tapes or anything unless powercycled. After powercycle all good.
 What i dont understand is, why does the drive pass health test but fails full write. Both failed ok, but one passed one failed doesnt add up for me.
 Use data: 12/2018 built, 1200 day Power on time, 40 power cycles, 40 cleans so far in lifetime, 3000 catridge loads.
 Newest firmware is installed.
 My first guess due to the high load count is worn out head. But can you really wear out a drive in just 3 years? My other hp drives are 8-10y old and work super fine. Or do you have any other ideas, suggestions, tips?
 If its the head: does anyone have a source for the spare? I am not afraid of a bit DIY, and wont pay 1500 eur to a company to fix it for my home use case (used just for me ar home, have 3 working lto6 drives so i am fine).
 Would be great to find some help.

 I'm interested in seeing if any other admins are experiencing consistent issues with Cisco AnyConnect in macOS Monterey whether it's a Mac upgrading to macOS Monterey or a new Mac fresh out of the box and provisioned.
 The "Certificate Validation Failure" is hitting our Mac community hard and is a growing issue for us. Certificates are deployed and placed in the System keychain via MDM w/ access to the required cert granted to the AnyConnect VPN client.
 Everything else in our configuration can read and access keychain items without issue but AnyConnect appears to have a really hard time validating the certificate it needs.
 When a user is hit with the cert validation error, they can "fix" it by running "security unlock-keychain" in Terminal and successfully activate VPN on the next attempt.
 Is anyone else dealing with this in macOS Monterey as a consistent issue?

 I guess a question for those who were sys admins at one point and have moved onto other specifically non-management roles?
 How'd you do it and did you choose or was it more of a progression from your previous role?
 I've been working in IT since 1998. I did what I guess was the natural progression of 1st level helpdesk ->desktop support ->sys admin. Made it from my 1st job to sys admin in 2.5 years and aside from a few failed forays into other areas, I've remained a sys admin almost exclusively since early 2001. I had a brief go as a team leader/management and discovered very quickly it was not for me. 
 I've been working project implementations exclusively for 5 years now and do enjoy the work. I tend to become the goto guy fairly quickly on projects (not saying I am perfect or know everything, far from it. I think it's just an age/experience thing and probably happens to everyone who has been around for 20+ years and a lot of the ppl I work with are younger than me)
 I'm curious about infra architecture roles but really don't know what the day to day is like and how to go about moving into that area.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a user who works off site behind a double NAT network. They routinely have issues being able to ping our local subnet which means they can't get to a server they need. They never have issues establishing the tunnel so I don't know why double NAT would come into play. I just noticed the issue while troubleshooting today. It feels more like an issue with their route table on Windows or a corrupted TCP/IP stack? Its weird because they are the only one having this issue as well. Im wondering if the VPN is getting confused, but as far as I know thats only inbound connections.
 Edit: I also want to add that nothing changes with the remote network that I know of and nothing with our local network. Its seemingly random when they can ping the server and when they cant. But, again, never an issue establishing the tunnel.

Client A: Linux, Northern California, in datacenter (1gbps)
 Client B: MacOS, Northern California, residential (500mbps)
 Server A: Virgina, US (1gbps)
 Server B: London, UK (1gbps)
  
Latency is pretty similar between both clients and servers, but TCP throughput is wildly different:
  
  Server A (Virginia) Server B (London) 
  
 Client A 60ms, 400Mbits/sec 136ms, 180Mbits/sec 
  Client B 68ms, 15Mbits/sec 🔴 140ms, 120Mbits/sec 
 
 I uploaded the raw iperf3 output, as well as mtr reports to server a
 I'm trying to understand why the performance of Client B is so poor to Server A, yet is much better to Server B which is further away.
 What stands out to be from the iperf3 data is:
  
MUCH bigger Cwnd with Client A (6mb vs ~120kb)
 MUCH greater Retr count with Client B
  
Additional info about Client B:
  
Cloudflare speed test shows 550mbps.
 0% packet loss to Server A, reported via `ping -i 0.1 <Server A>` for 60s.

 Any ideas on what might be happening, or how to debug this?

 So recently, there has been packet drops on our network in both internal network and external. Whenever we are downloading a file, the speed will gradually slow down and eventually come to 0 kbps then say it has network issues and stop downloading.
 At first, we isolated the issue to be our ISP. And after some testing from them they said that their radio was misaligned causing the packet drops. They fixed the issue on their end. We tested this by just plugging a computer straight into the router and downloading the same file we've been using as a test. There was no issue with downloading.
 So we tested the download on an access switch and on WiFi to see if the issue lies within the internal network. I plugged a laptop straight into the core switch and tested the download. The issue…]]></summary>

What I don't really understand is why a link would become unidirectional in the first place, rather than simply stopping. An example I saw was a fibre pair, one for recieving and one for transmitting. However, my understanding is that if a core went down, the link would simply drop.
 Am I missing something more obvious, or is it only for special use cases?

 So let me start off by saying I was recently offered a position as a Systems Administrator for a medium sized business with about 100 - 200 employees. Prior to this my only experience was working at a PC and cell phone repair shop. I do have a bachelors in IT, A+, CCNA, SEC+, Project+, LPI Linux Essentials, AWS Cloud Certified and ITIL V4 certifications. But I have like literally 0 help desk experience.
 I don't have much experience besides homelabs. I've never worked in an office IT setting. Frankly, I'm not even sure why they hired me. I have 0 terminal skills. I understand basic networking concepts and I can Google myself through most user-related issues. The pay is 70k in a medium-cost of living area.
 Am I being overpaid? I feel very guilty because my boss is the nicest boss I have ever worked for, and I almost feel like I am scamming them.

 Whats the difference between the two? How are you configuring CGNAT?
 I came across a comment saying that on CGNAT, we can limit the NAT entries for a user, or even session. I wonder if thats the only difference between the two, whereas normal NAT / masquerade doesnt limit the NAT entries and router will keep on NATting until it ran out of ports.
 When I say normal NAT, in Cisco command: ip nat inside source <source address acl> pool xyz overload

 I'm currently testing AlwaysOn VPN to replace Directaccess.
 It's working well, much much faster than DA.
 ​
 But I have a problem regarding migration in a real world scenario.
 when I deploy VPN configuration to a computer, the AOVPN goes up, and DirectAccess stop connecting (as the computer can join the NLS server)
 but as the DirectAccess GPO still applied, we have conflict with NRPT rules and some services doesn't work
 I can't exclude AOVPN device from DA Policy, because I'm not sure at which moment the device will get is AOVPN configuration up and running 
 If I remove immediatly, the computer will remove is DA configuration without having AOVPN configuration, and the user will loose corporate access
 Due to covid, we have a lot of remote user. and we don't want to have users without connection, having to go to work to repair etc
 Have any of you performed migrations from DA to AOVPN without asking users to come back to the office to have their computer reconfigured by the IT department?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks,
 Hope this helps some people out who need it. I covered the full SC-900 - Microsoft Security, Compliance & Identity Fundamentals course in one video, the editing for this nearly killed me, well not really, it was just a lot of work to make lol.
 Anyway the video is about almost 5 hours long since it covers the whole dang course obviously. With that said, if someone is looking for something specific in the course, it would take them forever to find it so I added a list in the video description with most of the main topics that are covered with time stamps next to each topic.
 The time stamps will make it quicker and easier for people to find what they are looking for if they don't want to watch the whole thing and are just looking for something specific.
 I will be adding a extra video after the course which will have practice questions in it to help prepare for the exam. Now before anyone goes and asks, no, those practice questions are NOT the questions out of the actual official exam, those kinds of questions are against Microsoft's rules and not allowed.
 The practice questions I make will however cover the same topics and measure you on the same skills so they are legal and allowed by Microsoft.
 As I said in the beginning, I hope this helps some of you out since I know what it's like when your boss/company forces you to write an exam and not being able to find any study resources for it.
 Same can be said for folks who can't afford to pay courses or who just can't find anything online. This should plug that hole.
 Below is a short 4-5 min course intro video I made which explains the course. The full course will be in the playlist or you can just go look on the channel, whatever floats your boat:

 I am thinking I should instead purchase a single wildcard certificate for use with all services on my localdomain.com domain. I just don't know how that works from the server / CSR perspective. Like I can make a CSR from server1 but I would have to do the same on the others, but it would be the same certificate. 
 I'm just a little unclear on the best approach. I use DigiCert mainly for 99% of our certs.

 Justin from Blackpoint Cyber here!
 If you're already a Blackpoint Cyber partner you should have gotten this (sorry for the double alert), but if you're not we wanted to make sure it got out to everyone else!
 Blackpoint Cyber is actively monitoring a Fortinet vulnerability involving authentication bypass. Tracked as CVE-2022-40684, users of the following products are vulnerable to attacks:
  
FortiOS: From 7.0.0 to 7.0.6 and from 7.2.0 to 7.2.1
 FortiProxy: From 7.0.0 to 7.0.6 and 7.2.0
  
This vulnerability could lead to remote threat actors logging into unpatched devices and performing operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.
 How to Mitigate:
 Fortinet released security patches on Thursday, October 6th, advising users to do the following:
  
Update vulnerable devices to FortiOS/FortiProxy versions 7.0.7 or 7.2.2., or
 Perform this workaround: Block remote attackers from bypassing authentication and logging into vulnerable FortiGate and FortiProxy deployments by limiting the IP addresses that can reach the administrative interface using a local-in-policy
  
Important: Blackpoint’s SOC has not seen any indicators of compromise in our partners’ environments.
 Blackpoint’s SOC will continue to actively monitor for any indicators of compromise associated with this vulnerability. We are confident that our experienced MDR analysts and technology will continue to protect your business and clients.
 Sincerely,
 Blackpoint Cyber

 Just looking for some advice on what to do. I'll keep this short as I can. 
 I was asked to refresh our storage infrastructure earlier this year. So I gave all of the required information on % growth rates and forecast projects to the supplier who we get hardware from to spec out a new solution. The solution has run out of space only after 6 months of prod usage My boss is fuming and long story short we are buying more storage, however he has said I should have been more vigilant even though they were the ones who used the forecast data to build the under-spec solution and the costs will be coming out of my pay
 Obviously I can't afford the cost of this and don't believe I should be liable for the failed solution. Is there anything I can do or any recourse?

We also tought about doing a document center but read that it was depreciated. There is also the idee of creating more site! Any idea anyone?

 Maggie commands
 Analysis of the malware revealed that it disguises as an Extended Stored Procedure DLL (“sqlmaggieAntiVirus_64.dll”) that is digitally signed by DEEPSoft Co. Ltd, a company that appears to be based in South Korea.
 Extended Stored Procedure files extend the functionality of SQL queries by using an API that accepts remote user arguments and responds with unstructured data.
 Maggie abuses this technical behavior to enable remote backdoor access with a rich set of 51 commands.
 A report from DCSO CyTec says that the variety of commands supported by Maggie allow querying for system information, executing programs, interacting with files and folders, enabling remote desktop services (TermService), running a SOCKS5 proxy, and setting up port forwarding.
 The attackers can append arguments to these commands, and Maggie even offers usage instructions for the supported arguments in some cases.

 I know that every VAR, and their great-great-great -grandmother's cat, swears they can do it.

 ​
 we have 2 domains each in their own location. There is a VPN connecting between both sites each domain with their own firewall, DNS and DHCP services. We would like to create a two-way trust relationship from Site A to Site B.
 ​
 Does anyone have the correct steps required to create a trust relationship? 
 ​
 My questions are :
 ​
 ​
 1- Here's a shortlist of the minimum amount of ports: Am I Correct ?
 ​
 Port Protocol Service
 ​
 53 TCP/UDP DNS
 ​
 88 TCP/UDP Kerberos
 ​
 389 TCP/UDP LDAP
 ​
 445 TCP SMB
 ​
 636 TCP LDAP (SSL)
 ​
 ​
 ​
 2 - Do I have to create two-way tust between the PDC emulator in both domains ?
 ​
 ​
 ​
 My environment:
 ​
 COMPANY A : We have 4 DC & DNS.
 ​
 DC1 is holding all FSMO roles.
 ​
 C:\Windows\system32>netdom query fsmo
 Schema master dc1.contoso.local
 Domain naming master dc1.contoso.local
 PDC dc1.contoso.local
 RID pool manager dc1.contoso.local
 Infrastructure master dc1.contoso.local
 The command completed successfully.
 ​
 ​
 COMPANY B : We have 4 DC & DNS.
 ​
 DC1 is holding all FSMO roles.
 ​
 C:\Windows\system32>netdom query fsmo
 Schema master dc1.companyB.local
 Domain naming master dc1.companyB.local
 PDC dc1.companyB.local
 RID pool manager dc1.companyB.local
 Infrastructure master dc1.companyB.local
 The command completed successfully.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not all MFAs are equal!! As we know, we're seeing a spike in multiple MFA attacks like MFA Fatigue on push notification authentication. With all these suspicious MFA attacks, it's been hard to cope.
 Thankfully, Microsoft has finally understood our concerns and provided options to choose different MFA security levels for different users. You can find this newly released grant control "require authentication strength in Microsoft conditional access." Navigate to the path below to find the newly released “require authentication strength” checkbox:
 Azure AD Admin Center --> Azure Active Directory ---> Security (Under Manage Tab) --> Conditional Access.
  
Hereafter, you can opt to allow SMS for base-level workers and implement stronger phishing-resistant MFA for admin & executive accounts.
  
Following a thorough analysis of all authentication methods, Microsoft has categorized three different authentication modes under the grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 
Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 
Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Note: This is still in "preview" mode. Sadly, it won't be available for everyone. Hope it will be rolled out for you soon if you don't see it!

 Stupid question here and Cisco hasn't given me a good answer yet. We're working on migrating about 2000 access points off a Cisco 8540 to a Cisco 9800. We've been using the CSV tool within the Configuration piece in the GUI and importing static tags with the format <mac addr>, <policy-tag>, <site-tag>, <rf-tag>. After we upload the CSV and point the APs to the 9800, they come up perfectly as designed.
 ​
 As we look to move wider chunks of APs, I want to make sure this work is done in advance of moving the APs. Cisco has said there is no way to dump all this IF the AP is not actively on the controller. This doesn't sound right since it's stored somewhere in the controller for when the AP does eventually join. Does anyone know of a way via CLI/GUI/API to dump these "staged" static tags?
 ​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have gone through the whole process to setup FIDO for my organization, the last remaining issue is I absolutely cannot get the workstations to display the security key option for authentication. Or any Windows Hello method for auth.
 I've set the GPO, windows deployment package, I even went through the hassle of adding my devices into intune and setting policy and enabling windows hello. I have all the options on the workstation in accounts after logging in, but cannot choose the method for authentication.
 Does anyone have suggestions? The troubleshooting flow in the KBs are quite worthless...

 We exclusively use Linux, and don't touch Windows so Veeam is unfortunately not an option. 
 Is there anything like this out there that can handle sending to S3 directly from each server? Everything I've found seems to be single server and either relies on mounting an S3 bucket as a disk or has no cloud based support at all.

 In the updates screen, it shows "Policies set on your device" as "Disable Automatic Updates"
 Is there something I can check? Based on the event log, the update was installed yesterday sometime, though I can't tell if the install was user initiated or not (if user initiated, then this makes sense).
 EDIT: Running wmic qfe list shows the update was installed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (while I see updates I know were done manually show domain/username). So doesn't seem user initiated. 
 How do I stop this behavior? This was running hyper-v workloads, and windows still decided to reboot.

 Should I just get them as traditional books or is a kindle suitable?

 Do you have any idea to test all switch/router ports at the same time just with two testing ports? I want to ensure that the device can do 240 Gbps switching without any problem.
 My idea is to configure each pair of ports in a separate VLAN and connect each VLAN to the next VLAN by connecting one port of the VLAN's pair to one of the ports on the next VLAN. The first port and last port of the device are connected to the testing ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have several DNS-Servers in your environment with dedicated servers for internet-resolution and internal servers that forward the external queries to them, there should be no outgoing queries except for the internet-DNS systems. Or at least there should be a concept on how queries move through the network.
 Check your config, esp. regarding forwarding config or internal root-NS and then validate on the firewalls if there's anything that shouldn't be there. 
 We got urgent requests from some customers over the last months where the guys managing DNS got informed (or saw for themselves) that servers contact the internet root-NS that shouldn't do that according to the config, and ofc their reaction covered the spectrum from "btw guys, i found that in the firewall, is this normal?" to "OMG, DID WE GET COMPROMISED!? Please do the needful to mitigate and provide turnaround time for resolution!"
 Turns out, the resolver (the OS-component, not a DNS-Server) on some linux systems regularly checks the Root-NS directly for the trust anchors. Not really critical and can be turned off with 2 commands.
 What i found strange is that it has been like that for several years and only a handful of customers was either paranoid, curious or bored enough to actually notice this so far. 
 So yeah...maybe look into that in advance if you have spare time before somethings pops up during an audit on the firewall and it becomes a high-prio issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two devices on the same wifi network can have the same public IP address. So when the router receives a packet, it has to translate the destination public IP address to the private IP of the intended device. This means NAT can only use the port numbers to identify a device on a local network, as well as which port of that device to send the packet to.
 Does this practice reduce the number of available ports that all of the devices combined can use at a time? Because each device can have a maximum of 65,536 ports and for multiple devices, the total number of ports increases with each new device, but the router can support a maximum of 65,536 ports itself.

nslookup works without issues. Disabled IPv6 for ethernet connection, manually configured to use different DNS server IPs as well. Even tried "netsh winsock reset" command.
 I can ping our DC & DNS IPs, disjoined/rejoined to domain without issues. Can recreate this on other Windows 11 PCs that were upgraded. Haven't tried a completely fresh PC yet, though. This was all done on client PCs so far. Not seeing anything in Event Viewer application/server logs on DC servers.
 I'm about at the end of my rope and thinking we should just revert these PCs back to Windows 10. I'd appreciate any helpful advice.

 https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/why-big-tech-shreds-millions-of-storage-devices-it-could-reuse/?comments=1
 They do mention some issues that have happened in the past when companies don't wipe/destroy data properly, either cos they outsource it to people/companies that don't do it properly or because someone got lazy, leading to fines and or lawsuits.
 I've wiped a few drives in my time working in tech and used them elsewhere in the company with an assurance the data is zeroed out but these have always been for internal use within the company. Looking around a bit I had a hard time finding guidance for a good methodology for erasing/wiping drives. Perhaps I'm looking for the wrong terms, or looking at the wrong sources.
 How do you guys do it? Any particular sources you trust that keep current with practices?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got called into a project to install a wireless Point to Point between two buildings at a client. The buildings have fiber, but they want a redundant link to avoid downtime. Apparently there's some upcoming construction and the boss is worried the fiber may get accidentally get cut in construction. 
 I've installed the Ubiquiti Power beam on each building and connected each end to a Cisco switch. I am using the PoE injectors. 
 In the testing phase, the PtP is working fine. The warehouse end comes out of a trunk port on the Cisco Switch, go through a PoE injector, then wireless goes across the parking lot to the admin building and then comes through another PoE injector. 
 If you plug a laptop straight to the injector, it joins you to the LAN. If you put an unmanaged switch on the injector, and then plug in, you're on the LAN. 
 But if you run the injector into the second switch, it doesn't go anywhere. The CLI doesn't even show the port (port 2) as active. 
 What am I missing? I have full access to the switches, but I don't really have a good background of Cisco Training.
 Ideally, I'd like both links to be active, so if the fiber broke, the PtP would keep everything online, and I believe STP would prevent a loop, if activated. 
 If all else fails, it's fine if the PtP stays unplugged from the switch until actually needed. 
 I've tested it both with the fiber plugged and unplugged, and it does not make a difference.

I did a show mac address-table and got the list of MAC addresses that were listed on all the ports, I then fed them into the MAB policy in ISE and successfully was able to MAB the hyper v port but almost all the ports went down and didn’t come back up once I applied MAB and bounced the port and one of them the minute I added the port that was the physical host in the server it went down and would not come back up until I removed all the authentication and tagged it directly into the vlan again with a “switchport access vlan xxx”command. In the end 99% of the ports either wouldn’t come up the minute I applied MAB to the port or went down when I applied MAB to some other port. I can’t imagine it’s not possible to MAB virtual servers and I must just be missing something.

 My team wants to make improvements in the lab and we are frequently asked by management what we would need to make it happen. Unfortunately, everyone currently working in the lab has really only experienced this lab environment and aren't aware of other technologies or improvements that could be made to run things a little more efficiently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy fellow sysadmins! I do some pro-bono consultation work for a small company (15 employees). They don't have significant financial resources, but they're cresting the amount of "random" systems that I can support without some management capability. 
 Setting up an entire active directory domain is extremely cost-prohibitive for them, so I'm looking for solutions. They already have a new Synology NAS, and it appears that Synology's offering for their Directory Server is pretty alright for what I think I need.
 I'm looking for a way to standardize accounts & permissions across their workstations, as well as a way to push group policies to the machines. It looks on the surface that all of this is supported. 
 They currently use a paid Google service for all their email, etc. but I've also thought of Microsoft 365 for them if the juice is worth the squeeze. From what I've been reading, they'd be paying the same price, but I would get all the added benefit of AD features (not all, but the critical ones).
 So, my question is this... 
  
Does anyone here have any experience using Synology's DS offering?
 
What are you using for secondary DNS? I know the primary DNS is recommended to be run on the Synology along with the DS. 
 Currently DNS is on their pfsense, but I wouldn't mind turning that into the secondary if it would support all the weird things needed for DS to work correctly.
 
 Has anyone use the Microsoft 365 offering? Is that worth checking out? How does it handle Group Policy, etc.
  
I'm sure this conversation will evolve, but I'd love to hear folks impressions.
 Full disclosure: For my background, I spent 10 years as a Windows System admin from 2000-2010 and am very comfortable in that environment. I then switched careers into Cyber and now focus on OT, so I've been Linux focused for the last 12 or so. Extremely comfortable in both environments and have been running Linux workstations and servers for 20 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not entirely understanding what the best practice is for managing VLANs, subnets, and broadcast domains is when designing an enterprise LAN. 
 Here's a basic LAN segment to reference throughout this post.
 Across an organization, let's assume that at that a small size site with a single switch has VLAN 69 specified for interfaces connecting to PCs. 
 At a larger site, there will be multiple switches connecting to a central core switch (or switch cluster), which then connected upstream to a router (router-on-a-stick). If I deploy VLAN 69 on both of the access switches, despite them being in different subnets, the trunk links connecting the access switches to the core switch will expand my broadcast domain to include both of these networks. The L3 traffic will be contained to whatever the mask is set to (in this case, the two /24s as shown in the diagram), but the L2 traffic will include all three switches and the LAN-facing router interface. 
 Q: Is it possible to keep the broadcast domain limited to the scope of only the respective /24 networks without having to specify two separate VLAN IDs, or do I have to make one of the switches operate on a different VLAN ID? 
 If separate VLAN IDs are required, how do you best design your VLAN deployments? Do you have ranges of VLAN IDs for specific purposes (i.e. VLAN 60-69 for PCs, VLAN 70-79 for Servers, etc.)?

I'm talking about printers, monitors, docking stations and any other semi-expensive tech one might deploy. Do you simply slap some type of asset tag on those device? I know there is countless asset management systems, but what about the smaller businesses? Typically, they are understaffed in IT as it is, and hardly pay for the necessities let alone an asset management system. I know there are free options out there, but I can't vouch for helpful those might be. Aside from that, we still have to rely on other people to physically return or ship these devices back, at least this is the case in my role. That's the part I hate, depending on someone else to do their job. How the hell do you make sure so and so returns all the equipment they should have in possession at the end of their employment? I mean printers and monitors don't exactly go back into their boxes nice and neatly if they still even have them. I sure as hell can't depend on an end user to pack things up nice and safely. What about disgruntled terminated employees? They obviously are bitter and are less cooperative. Do you have to get company council involved for them? 
 I know this turned more into a rant as I went on. I just am tired of that sense of searching for needles in a haystack and pulling teeth trying to keep up with tracking tech all over the county.

 I’m trying to navigate the world of ruggedized laptops. At the moment my company continues to deploy refurbished Panasonic tough books, and while they’ve been somewhat reliable the fact is that most of these devices are 9 to 11 years old. Even replacing the HDD for a SSD is starting to become problematic as other components of these devices are continuing to fail. Third generation i5’s that have been heavily used aren’t having much fun anymore and I’m not having much fun supporting them at this point. 
 If you currently deploy laptops of these nature, then what is your go to? I know we’re currently paying ~$800 a piece for these older CF-53 laptops from a private refurbisher. There’s been discussion about going back to “standard” laptops for these guys as they aren’t exactly roughing it in the backwoods but I want to present a more current option for a rugged device if possible. Please note that I know they would be perfectly okay with refurbished devices if that isn’t obvious enough.

 Does anyone know what the comparison would be for Nokia's NOKIA 7250 IXR-E in a VSR enviroment and the equivalent of the HUAWEI CX600-M2K as a virtual router? I have a client that wants the capabilities of those devices but on the software version. Any leads on dealers?
 TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a lecture hall with six Cisco 3602 APs. I counted 115 clients during today's class session with 90% of them on the 5GHz band. The students and professor are complaining about the wifi. 
 The distribution of clients heavily favors 2 APs. One 5Ghz radio had 35; the other had 30. Other APs in the area had 0-10 clients. I have tried adjusting the power levels and will do further tests to try to determine why so many APs are favoring 1-2 5GHz radios when there are 4+ more to choose from in the immediate area. 
 This lecture hall has tables for each row so the clients aren't as densely packed as you're imagining and the APs are evenly distributed overhead. The only way to fit ~100 people in this room is to have an even distribution of bodies in seats. I think that rules out favoring 1-2 radios based on proximity. But I'm no expert
 Load balancing is not enabled on the controller. Does anyone have experience with this feature? I can't find much information on it aside from Cisco saying it will totally work. 
 We do have band-select enabled and that appears to be working. The controller is a 5508 running 8.5.171.0

 This last one was for a "Greek Sqaud" renewal that was an image with no text other than "HELLO USER". Complaints fall into a black hole, but they're never from the same address twice, so even if Google did block the user, they're just back using ImaDickweed298 instead of ImaDickweed297.
 There are only a handful of domains that I can't consider putting a blanket ban on, and they're one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a email filter to block/quarantine all the obvious spam & malicious intent emails but curious what everybody else does for spoofed emails? So, the sender is using Gmail for example but lists their name as someone in the company usually an exec's name or as a service such as "IT Admin". 
 Right now I prepend the emails Subject line with "**** WARNING ****" and also include a large yellow box in the message body that says in so many words Caution, External Sender , Fake, Stranger Danger, etc. 
 I understand how a person might breeze past the subject line but the yellow box cannot be missed. At least that's what I thought. I still get folks contacting me asking if emails are legit or not. Their email includes the two prepended warnings but they are still unsure. I am happy everyone is being safe but I thought the warnings make it obvious.
 Again, curious what other people's strategies are for spoofed emails and warning the user base.
 (I would prefer to block them outright but, numerous Execs use personal gmail, yahoo, outlook etc. to email themselves)

 We have a client that was having slow download speeds while on the Global VPN client. I did some digging and found an article that describes a technology called Receive Segment Coalescing which from what I could gather is used to offload processing to NIC of the machine. They stated that Microsoft recommended disabling this feature so I gave a try with the client. Sure enough it worked like a charm but I'm trying to understand why this fixed the issue. Maybe I have to do some more digging but was curious if anyone on here happen to know anything about this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, looking for some advice.
 We are moving to a new 9500sq. ft. heavy equipment shop (aprox. 12 bays).
 basic info:
 -ISP will be starlink (remote location)
 -5-15 admin users doing only ERP + google suite(email, drive)
 -big empty warehouse, 115x85ft, 24ft tall. Only obstructions would be actual steel columns and equipment sitting there
 -small 9x20ft drywall office in the middle
 -remote location means IT support will be mostly remote
 -EDIT, forgot to add, 6-10 poe security cameras.
 ​
 Project needs:
 We need a good wifi coverage in the entire warehouse, use will be on the light side. Initially I wanted to avoid running utp cables in my service racks (oil, air, etc) so I wanted to explore a mesh solution that would only require a central node with data plus 4-6 antennas connected to power outlets. Is there a commercial/enterprise mesh wifi that you guys would recommend or instead invest in a switch, running utp cables, and APs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: When you have a duplicate address problem, it's probably because you set things up incorrectly so that there is a duplicate IP on the network. 
 Our order is still trickling in, but I got a few devices so I figured I'd set up a Switch and AP so I can start getting our RADIUS / Eduroam / WPN set up on the AP. 
 Plugged the Meraki into the Cisco 2960S with both sides on a Trunk port. 
 Am able to use multiple VLans on the Meraki. Can see the internet, can ping other VLans. Routing is working fine, DHCP to a new test Server is working fine, and DNS is working fine. 
 The issue is that on the core switch we're getting that error %IP-4-DUPADDR: Duplicate address which is seeing the downlink interface MAC as assigned to the Gateway IP for the Meraki Management VLan, but that Gateway IP is also assigned to the SVI on the Core Switch (Cisco 4500x). 
 You can easily see this by either pinging outside from the Windows Server (Google DNS is the main test IP), but it's the same from the Windows Server to the 4500x (Pure Storage -> Nexus -> 4500x). But pinging from the 4500x to the ASA it fails not at all. 
 I believe that by removing BDPU Guard on the 2960S downlink interface so I could attach the Meraki I should also enable Root Guard on the Meraki to allow BDPU frames to flow down and to not have the Meraki think the uplink interface is the root bridge in its little STP brain. 
 Any assistance would be appreciated.

 And hell we even have Oracle products that support it out of the box... (I mean these are the guys with "If you choose to have a firewall in your organization." in their documentation)

 We have tested Zabbix and Open NMS but we really don't have the resources to self host and maintain. We are considering Open NMS Meridian at this time but was wondering if anyone has any suggestions. It does not need to be free or open source. It also cannot require a PC or some type of equipment onsite to run an agent. 
 The Dude was very simple to use with its ability to build the maps, add separate sites, add notes and add objects. We have not really found anything exactly the same. Anyone know of anything similar? We also use ConnectWise Manage. Integration would be nice but not necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I have a issue that i can’t seem to solve:
 I have a WDS server running, make boot images and install images. Now i want them to run unattended, i made a answer file and attached it to my test image. But when i PXE boot and select my boot image there is no sign that i uses the unattended file and makes me go through the full setup.
 What could be the issue?
 It should just connect to the server, sign in and run through the setup by itself.
 It seems that the boot image is not using the unattended file.
 Thanks in advance for any help given 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let me start off by saying that I recently started a new job, where I'm trying to implement MDT for imaging. I came from a position where I was using SCCM for imaging, so I'm familiar with Task Sequences, but I'm familiar with SCCM TS, which are a bit different from the MDT. (SCCM provides more options in the TS - More steps that aren't available in vanilla MDT)
 That being said, I've got my TS to install the Operating System, but it won't install applications. If I try to install applications without rebooting, it says that it can't install applications from WinPE, so it's going to reboot. Then it reboots and never finishes the TS.
 From doing some Google searching, it seems that it's the WinRE that performs this step. However, I can't get my TS to boot into WinRE to do that step. When I do the reboot step, it reboots into the main Windows OS, and just finishes the windows setup. The steps after that reboot never run. What am I doing wrong? How can I get it to reboot and still finish the task sequence?

Some, their network was taken down completely as well. I've seen some quick dirty lists of controls to implement for this but damn it stresses me out because some of those with seemingly everything in place, still get hit. The fact that I would be at the office 24/7 rebuilding basically everything if that were to happen. Even if you have backups that don't get hit, restoring everything and making sure its clean would be a nightmare in itself.
 It's literally the only "stressor" in my role, wondering if/when you'll get hit and what that will be like... How do you push that out of your mind?

 I am under the impression that if I get a tone, the line is working as intended. Could there still be an issue that IT could fix even if I am getting my tone to traverse the whole line? These lines have been underground for about 50 years now so I am assuming it is normal wear and tear issues but I have to meet with the head of facilities to explain that to him and I'm not sure how to put it.

 I’ve been given a task to find suitable governance tools for MS Teams, that can enforce some simple governance tools across a few thousand teams.
 The basics: - we want to see orphaned Teams and be able to quickly delete them
  
we want to force all current and future Teams to have at least 2 owners (so the specific departments themselves prevent orphaning their teams)
  
Does anyone know of a tool like that? We’re a very cybersecurity-minded org, with all our eggs in the MS basket, so we definitely need it securely integrate with MS.
 What solutions are you guys using? Do you think it would be better to just enforce it with PowerShell and angry emails?

I have another switch that is my DHCP, when I connected the 1920s to that switch with the patch cord, the 1920s doesn't get any IP address at all. I don't see this in the log. I found that the default IP for HP 1920s switche is 192.168.1.1 My main switch is also configured for this IP. Ok, I tried to connect directly to the laptop. I have configured IPv4 on the Windows machine to be IP - 192.168.1.10 Mask default 255.25.255.0. The switch is not accessible on 192.168.1. And I can see it's connected with 100MB but should be 1G. Does it mean the switch is dead? Or I am doing something wrong? Thanks

When the machine boots up I am greeted by a "Program Compatibility assistant" warning saying that the driver iqvw64e.sys is vulnerable and that it cannot load.
 I looked it up and that looks like this bug: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00051.html
 So I went and installed this:
 https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15084/intel-ethernet-adapter-complete-driver-pack.html
 And when I reboot it is still telling me that the file is vulnerable.
 I noticed that when I installed the update from Intel the driver never changed at all, there are 4 copies of it on this system and they are all this file:
 05/22/2019 02:57 AM 58,304 iqvw64e.sys
 Is anyone aware if it is possible to correct this?

An RDS server with Office 365 (haven't tried, but apparently is very resource expensive as well)

 What kind of shelving/cabinets/storage set up do you have for your spare parts in the data center? I have a few Bakers shelves and some miscellaneous totes. However, it has now ended up where I have stuff laying around all over the place on the floor in different cages because there’s not enough shelving and no real system. 
 Wondering what you all do, and if you’d be willing to share some pictures of your set up. I would really like to do better.

 I’m looking for a platform that will update the warranty status of our endpoints (we use major manufacturers like MS, Dell, Lenovo, and Apple). We currently use Solarwinds Service Desk, which is fine, but won’t give us warranty information unless that info is already on the device, so it’s hit or miss. I’m looking for something that will pull the warranty status from the manufacturer for the most up to date information.
 Please let me know if you have any recommendations, thank you!

 I have N (e.g. 2) vrfs with associated routing tables. For simplicity, let's call it as usual, red/blue. Each of vrfs has veth interface linking into depth of Openstack, (but it's not important). red should have route to 10.0.1.0/24 via veth_red and blue should have route to 10.0.2.0/24 via veth_blue.
 I also has 10.0.3.0/24 on the dummy0 on host.
 I want to make both 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/14 to be reachable from dummy0. And I can't undestand what route and where should I put.
 I need to put route to blue vrf for 10.0.1.0/24 (and corresponding red). But how should I force host to look into those tables?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a catch-all IT manager and the latest thing to fall on my lap is joining an international office to our UK-based domain. We have a handful of staff abroad and we want to get their computers fully corporate/policy/etc.
 I don’t know where to begin as networking is my least strongest subject within my many, many hats.
 Right now those in the international office will VPN in to access network resources. But this is just like “working from home”.
 What I want is a second AD DS server over there which will act as a backup DC and allow “local” authentication, etc. Corporate laptops will therefore always be domain joined.
 Where do I begin?
 My research says something like purchasing: a router/firewall, a switch, a windows server, then the various cabling/infrastructure and probably an Aruba Instant-on AP for wireless.
 Do I configure the windows server to VPN on over to our domain? 
 I’m getting a flight over and buying a Netgate 4100 running Pfsense. Do I configure the VPN there?
 I appreciate this is a big question and a big can of worms, and I can see why people might suggest employing a 3rd party network specialist to sort it over there, but I reckon getting over the domain join hurdle and setting up the firewall are the 2 only obstacles I have.
 Any thoughts greatly appreciated – thanks from an overworked, overhatted, accidental sysadmin.

 First: (copies all and the permissions)
 ROBOCOPY "\\oldserver\folder1" "G:\folder1" /E /ZB /XD DfsrPrivate /PURGE /COPYALL /R:0 /NP /tee 
 Second: (hopefully just changes)
 ROBOCOPY "\\oldserver\folder1" "G:\newserver" /mir /R:0 /np 
 The second 1 can take just as long to run/finish. The folder is about 1TB.
 Is that about normal in terms of time. Bother servers are VMs on the same 10GB network. CPU/Mem all seem low too.

 We have a Net2 server/setup located in one office and a number of doors/ACUs connected to it locally, but we are now in the process of setting 5 doors/ACUs in a remote office – we have the network configuration in place and from the server that is hosting our Net2 server I can ping the remote office ACUs by the IP addresses they have been assigned (this only proves ICMP but I all add more on)
 The issue I note is that when I try to detect doors with the detect button I am not seeing any new doors appear in the list, however if I try to manually add one of the ACUs/Doors by MAC it lets me but when entering the IP it gives me an error/status that the IP is already in use by a device with the same MAC address
 I am not sure what exactly could be the issue here but I have noted it does get added into the Net2 Access Control tool so we can somewhat configure and use it.
 The issue is that it is not working fully as expected with the error/notice above, is there anything major we could be missing?
 To me it looks like the door is being seen by our server but not detected correctly.
 Anyone has experience with this?

 He doesn't message me directly to ask for stuff(He only messages when he can't fix something and wants help which I am no longer providing) During office working hours whenever something breaks and he can't fix it - Old guys fault, no idea what to do.
 now normally I wouldn't care, but I have tons of non technical colleagues there and it's my reputation on line, should I get in touch with ex boss and inform him about this stuff?

 We have 14 devices (mostly Dell laptops, different models, and one Surface Pro) with this issue. The screen locks after 5 min regardless of power/screensaver settings.
 Some devices are running win10 others win11.
 Troubleshooting steps tried:
 - Restore power settings to default
 - Assign a different power plan
 - Modified screensaver settings or disable screensaver
 - Local Policies > Security Options > “Interactive Logon: Machine inactivity limit” set it to 900 seconds or more...
 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20\7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0 -> set attributes to 2 and then modify system unattended sleep timeout option to 30 min or whatever number above 5.
 - Checked dell optimizer proximity sensor 
 - Run power troubleshooter
 - Uninstall recent windows updates
 - All Dell updates for device are done
 Any other ideas?

 Or do the cameras need something to them as well? Like do the cameras need to support 802.11w or something for this to work? My cameras doesn't have Ethernet support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 tldr: Got computers getting DHCP leases from the wrong VLAN
 Got a weird issue. At my current $job we have multiple VLANs for various systems, the basic network is CLIENT (untagged) --> Cisco Phone (Tagged) --> Meraki/Netgear Switch --> Cisco Nexus --> Router (VyOS) --> HyperFlex + Vmware --> Windows Server 2019 with DHCP (in fail over) + MDT Server.
 The VyOS router has DHCP relay listeners on all the client networks to route them to the Windows servers for DHCP (or MDT).
 Now the issue is VLAN 1 (as the default) is only used for network management, everything else is on their own VLANs.
 100 - VoIP / 200-202 - Client / 300 - Servers
 So the issue is, some PCs (Dell desktops) or laptops (Dell Laptop + Dock OR Lenovo Laptop + Dock) picks up a DHCP offer from the wrong network. Some times it could be on the old client VLAN or currently it's attempting to bind to VLAN 1's range.
 Most of the PCs, if we get Windows (10 or 11) to do a network reset (or manually do netsh winsock reset & netsh ip int reset), the system comes good.
 Notes
  
Statically setting the IP address, allows the computer to work on the correct VLAN
 The computer gets the IP but fails to release OR communicate with anything (IE if it's on the wrong VLAN)
 All the DHCP is running from 2 servers in a failover configuration under M$ on Windows
 The computers are either freshly built or been running for about 3-9 months
 Everything is updated to the latest versions (as per M$ for Windows, Dell/Lenovo for drivers, Cisco/Netgear for switches, VyOS for router)
 Each port is configured for the native VLAN to be the correct client VLAN + the VoIP VLAN being tagged for the phones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently we've been increasing security on some of our important domain accounts, mainly privileged dev & sysadmin users. Adding them to the Protected Users group was one of those measures.
 Ever since, we're not able to authenticate to our SQL Server using these accounts, neither using Windows Authentication nor SQL Server Authentication. Removing the protected users group completely removes the problem. We're aware this is due to the data not being stored in the local cache which is used in the authentication process.
 I wonder if there are workarounds, or if there's similar security features which would not break our authentication.

 ​
 Sorry if it sounds dumb or not. 
 So we have our own /24 ip-block and have connections in the 350 E Cermak data center, and we get everything routed correctly in our market, except google.
 Analyzing our traffic, any type of google traffic is not reaching the Chicago region, but going to Amsterdam which is a whole other country.
 What throws me off, any google traffic from our /24 blocks goes to Amsterdam, but if use our carrier network from DC I am able to reach google in our Chicago Market... 
 I have verified everything from Geo-Location is correct to anything, still makes me pull my hair out lol.
 Verified from our carrier that they are peering with google in the same building.
 ​
 Any reason why only Google tossing our traffic to another country?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this one has been a doozy, I just wanted to see if anyone has experienced anything similar. 
 We recently had our static IP pool increased from a /30 to a /29. Ever since the change, we've had persistent bandwidth issues. Upload is pitiful, download is meh on what's supposed to be 200 symmetrical. I spent way too much time this week digging through firewall configs, running iperf tests throughout the network, checkin MTU size, cables, and generally tearing our network apart while the ISP was unresponsive. 
 I tested multiple devices of different brands isolated on the direct connection, all capable of pulling gigabit+, and all pulled 60 max. Configured the firewalls to be glorified routers, both still pulled pitiful speeds. 
 I was running a tracert during this diagnosis and saw an interesting IP in there... our old gateway for the previous static pool we had. But the firewalls and routers I tested on the connection all had the new IP and gateway set. On each, packets hit the router, hit the old gateway ip, then went on their way. All show the new public static. 
 I'm not sure if that's the cause of the bandwidth issues we're having (though I believe I've conclusively ruled out anything on our end causing it unless like 6 different routers/firewalls with no extra configs have the same issue). 
 Anyone seen an ISP route you through the wrong gateway regardless of the config on your end? Definitely a first for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep going round and round with the security guy at my work. He believes it is a perfectly acceptable solution to have an internal server accessible from the internet as long as it passes through some type of "proxy" in the DMZ. These proxies can range from an F5 virtual server that is NOT doing any WAF, to just an IIS box setup to reverse proxy. 
 In my mind I believe this is a bad idea because these proxies just do trash-in trash-out and any compromise that were to occur would now be in an internal server network instead of a DMZ.
 Is this really not as bad as I think it is, or am I right to question this practice?

 Basically, if a client gets blacklisted, the firewall stop responding at some point in the process which will often make http clients just hang eternally. I've seen CMS providers do this before where once blocked, python http requests, curl, wget will all just hang up until the process is killed or if a explicit timeout is defined.
 Is there a term given for this type of technique in networking?

 It's a stack of (3) Cisco 9300's, and they're all 48 copper port switches, however in the config it's showing the following:
 switch 1 provision c9300-48t switch 2 provision c9300-24t switch 3 provision c9300-24t 
 I tried to just overwrite it by entering "switch 2 provision c9300-48t" while in global config mode but it doesn't seem to change anything. After, I tried to remove the 24t entry first, but it says "Error: A switch is already physically present at this location". 
 How can I get this to show up correctly so I can access/configure all 48 ports on switches 2 and 3?

 These new HP printers require this software package to install them that doesn't run on Windows Server OS's. 
 For instance: https://support.hp.com/ca-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-3001-3008dne-dwe-hp-printer-series/38120047/model/38120950
 The HP Universal Print Driver would not install as a driver for this device.
 To get this printer setup on our print server, I had to start the install on a Win10 workstation, Download the driver package, Move the package up to the server, Extract the files inside the .exe file, and install a driver using those extracted files. 
 What the heck am I missing here? I've started to see this on new HP Business printers more and more. How does HP want us to handle setting up these printers in an environment with AD? I want to be able to push them out with GPOs... What gives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I am having a problem with an automation I am writing but I am having some difficulty with troubleshooting SCP on a Cisco 2960X. 
 ​
 I have two different Ansible servers. One is local to the switch, same subnet, etc. The other is a remote host in Azure, with a port forward for this specific IP to translate TCP 2222 to 22 to this test switch. The local Ansible server appears to start SCP sessions as intended. No problems, nothing in the logs to indicate any problem, multiple 40 mb files transferred. The remote one is able to open a SSH connection, but SCP sessions fail. 
 I have turned debugging on in the switch and while I do see the remote Ansible server is able to start a session, there is little to nothing in the log to indicate a problem. Same with a packet capture. It appears to start a session, start a second session, then gracefully closes both sessions. 
 The code sample I am using on both Ansible servers is identical and a direct SCP session using Ubuntu CLI does not work either. 
 The only relevant error I am seeing is from the playbook when it fails:
 ​
  
TASK [Copying image to the switch... This can take time, please wait...] ************************************************************** 
 fatal: [%hostName%]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "destination": "flash:/test.txt", "msg": "Exception received: Error transferring file to flash:/test.txt: Initializing SCP session of remote file [flash:/test.txt] for write failed with error [b'Socket error: No such file or directory']"}
  
I am frankly running out of ideas, as this makes no sense as to why its not working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a set of network access requirements for some systems:
  
Domains or IP addresses
 Ports
  
I would need to block connections that are not to one of those domain/IP and port combination.
 In a firewall, I am able to hardcode IP addresses that need to be allowed. For example, I can create a rule to allow traffic:
  
TCP
 IP : 123.123.123.123
 Port : 25
  
And block all other Port 25 requests, for example.
 However, the tricky thing is when domains are involved. For example, if I need to allow:
  
TCP
 Domain : Reddit.com
 Port : 443
  
I need to allow Port 443 through my firewall, but I cannot hardcore any IP addresses.
 I am now using Cisco Umbrella for DNS filtering, so that I can block DNS requests to domains that are not approved. So in the above example, I would add Reddit.com to the allow list.
 However, with port 443 now open in the firewall, and since I cannot hardcore IP addresses and rely on DNS filtering, a virus could use an IP address to exploit port 443 (no DNS request to Cisco Umbrella).
 Cisco Umbrella has an agent to guard against this, but I can’t install it because I have a Ubuntu system.
 Cisco Umbrella aside, how can you guard against viruses using hardcoded IP addresses and circumventing DNS filtering?
 I should add : I am using Ubuntu Linux as a WireGuard sever, so not a NGFW

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been tasked with taking over management of a small management company in our organization. They are completely legally separate from our main org, so they can't be on our main infrastructure. 
 They're only 10 employees, but need an RDS server as they have an old-school financial system and a couple apps which need to run on a server (and need SQL). Currently they have an older RDS server managed by an outgoing MSP. That server is attached to the MSP's domain, so the users use separate credentials for logging in to RDS.
 We're replacing/upgrading the RDS server, which on the surface is easy enough. The challenge is - this company has no domain environment otherwise, so on top of an RDS server, we'd have to spin up a DC. They do have 365 / Azure AD though.
 Just wondering - is there a more graceful way of handling RDS without the domain? Could people login using Azure auth. I'm looking for the simplist and most gaceful way of hosting a small RDS environment for 10-12 users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Or in other words: Do I need a backup MX?
 The situation is this: I want to receive newsletters from news sites. Some senders are high traffic senders that send out a lot of emails to each subscriber, sometimes even 1 per minute, or 1 per 10 minutes on average.
 I have trouble with receiving this amount with various email service providers, because I run into receiving rate limits. So, I’m considering hosting my own mail server for this purpose.
 But self-hosting on a VPS can have outages…
 I don’t mind if some emails get lost if the senders don’t retry, but I don’t want them to stop sending me all together if my server goes down temporarily.
 Let’s say my server goes down for 1 or 2 days for whatever reason. (Let’s not discuss how likely it is. There may be an outage, or I may screw something up.) Also, let’s assume my server is either up or down, but when it’s up, it’s accepting mails normally. So, I’m not rejecting mails.
 So, the question is this: If there is a busy sender that sends out a huge number of emails, and they see my server went offline or port 25 is not responding for a day or two, then what happens? What’s the most common behaviour? Will they resume sending me when my server comes online again? Or will they consider me gone forever?
 Phrasing it in another way: How long would a receiving mail server need to be down in order for a busy sender to stop sending to it all together?
 Or does it depend on the sender and the situation, and there is no standard behaviour?
 The special situation here is that these are busy senders. I understand that normally a sender should and will retry. But when a sender sends out hundreds of emails a day or more to each of its subscribers, they may handle this differently.
 Again, I don’t mind lost mails, I just don’t want to re-subscribe to the newsletters after every outage I may have.
 And I don’t really want to have a backup MX unless I really need to.
 Some expert advice would be appreciated… Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I’m a sysadmin with a little over 3 years of professional experience in IT. I’m coming up on a year in my current role and am becoming stagnant. I don’t see any potential of upward mobility and my learning is decreasing over time. This has me looking for the next move. It’s no secret that DevOps and cloud are some of the hottest spaces in IT right now. Pondering transitioning into one of the other, some questions that come to mind are:
 -What are the pros and cons of each?
 -How similar are they? It seems like oftentimes I’ll see cloud and DevOps in the same sentence.
 -As a current sysadmin, what are the most important skills for me to acquire to land one of these roles?
 To expand a bit more on the last one, my current technical skillset includes general Windows enterprise management (AD, DNS, server administration w/ VMWare), intermediate scripting skill in PowerShell, automation experience with Ansible, exposure to monitoring/alerting with Prometheus & Grafana… just to name a few. So pretty general sysadmin in the modern world I would say.
 To create a plan of action, I’m looking to determine what skills to develop and how to prioritize them. Some that immediately come to mind are:
 -AWS -Terraform -Python
 What am I missing from this list, and what are your thoughts?

 I've inherited an infrastructure with an Hyper-V Cluster running in Windows server 2012 over 4 PowerEdge FC630 in a FX Cluster , there was a crash of one of the blades, and I started to get around to understand how all of this was setup (knowing the previous Admin that worked on itisn't there anymore)
 Basically right now I am facing an issue on SCVMM 2012/Hyper-V Cluter manager where I have the subnet created for LIVE Migration showing 2 subnets, the one for live migration (10.0.12.0/24) and the one for Heartbeat (10.0.11.0/24) and if I look at the Live migration settings on HyperV/SCVMM, there is indeed 10.0.11.0/24 configured as a subnet, and the delete button is greyed out, even if I add 10.0.12.0/24 and put it first, same thing if I run a powershell command, the subnet 11.0 won't disappear
 How the setup is, NIC1 and NIC2 are bonded/teamed on the windows server, there's a virtual switch created from SCVMM, with 3 interfaces on different vlan/subnet for Heartbeat/LiveMigration/HostHyperV
 Thanks for reading through and any help appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have been having issues with a switch we recently put into place in a building on our base. The setup is as follows....
 Core switch > 3850 fiber switch > 3560 access switch
 With this setup, we have been having some problems and we believe they are related to AAA. Our AAA server is ISE and it is doing TACACS as well as RADIUS and MAB for clients.
 The failures seem to be intermittent, but basically out of 4 clients, only 2 of them will authenticate. The other 2 are not failing authentication, but the MACs are also not showing up anywhere. Its like they aren't even there, even though the interface is up. The 2 devices will briefly be put into the correct VLAN, but then after a minute or so, they go back into our "black hole" vlan, and nothing about them shows up in the switch logs or ISE logs. 
 So my question is, could the issue be the fact that we are daisy chaining the 3560 and not going directly to our core switch? My boss seems to think that a setup like this is not how networking should be done. I do agree that it probably is not best practice, but I feel like the issue would be more so if the 3850 switch can handle the load of traffic going over it. Would there be any special type of configuration that needs done with a setup like this, besides just configuring a normal trunk port?
 Another thing that just popped up is we noticed that we have "switchport block unicast" on the trunk ports. We referenced another network that we managed and on that network, we only have that command on the access ports. Could that possibly be causing the inconsistent authentication errors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, Posted this in the Office 365 Subreddit but haven't had any reply's yet so thought I'd try here.
 Have a bit of a strange one... This morning we've had loads of users complaining that they received multiple Teams meeting cancellation emails for various old meetings in the early hours of the morning (4:00am UK time). I've spoken to one organizer of one of these meetings. It was set up in October 2020 and he's adamant that he hasn't manually cancelled it himself. It appears its been automatically cancelled and then a notification email was sent to all users of said meeting at 4:00am.
 Is this something Outlook / Teams does automatically?
 Are there any settings available to control this behavior - particularly not to send these emails in the early hours?
 Any help, greatly appreciated.

 I have user account that keeps locking out every couple of hours, the users account has been migrated to 365 but the logs say it is locking out against our on-prem exchange server and the source network address is an IP address from a Microsoft data center. 
 I’ve used netwrix and that says it is an Android 1.0 device with an incorrect password, the user says they don’t have an android device and using powershell the only mobile I can see that the user has with their email on is an iPhone which has successfully synced today. 
 Does anyone have any other solutions or things I could look at? I’m really starting to run out of ideas.

Save. 3 hours later it's back to Sale. Log in again, this time make sure it's updated in AzureAD and Exchange, query with PS. 3 hours later it's changed back again. Log in with PS and update it again. Query with PS, check Exchange, Active Users, and AzureAD. 3 hours later it's changed back.

 For example let's say I have experience with Debian but the company I want to apply to is using Ubuntu, so when the interview comes should I'd say I know linux but not Ubuntu specifically. Would this lower my chances of being hired by alot?
 When I know something in theory but don't remeber the commands should i say I know how to do it and then watch online for the commands?
  
Thanks all in advance to all the replies, I'm a bit anxious and I don't want to do bad in my first job!

 We have a hybrid environment (Win2016/Exchange 2016), that I am gradually migrating to Office 365.
 Migrating users is going fluently.
 However we also have some distribution groups, used for 'generic' email addresses. 
 The issue is that these distribution groups are not synced to Office 365 (by AD Connect). So as they are not visible in Office365, I can't migrate them to Office 365. 
 For Ad Connect, I have made a security group "AD Sync Office 365", that I have added all users to. And in AD Connect wizard, I am have selected this security group in the filtering page. So AD connect is only syncing object in this security group.
 So I am suspecting that our distribution groups are not syncing because these distribution groups are not a member of the mentioned security group. And I can't find a way to add he distribution groups to this security group.
 In AD connect troubleshooting these distribution groups , I also get this error :
 Object is not present in sync scope as group filtering is enabled and the object is not a member of filtering group "CN=AD_Sync_Office365,OU=Security Groups,OU=MyBusiness,DC=xxxxx,DC=local".
 Do you have some advice?

 . We maintain a sd wan network with remote sites all over the world and one of them was complaining about a server not being reachable intermittently, this server is accessed by this site only so we only got this complaint from them, interestingly, we are able to ping this server once or twice successfully from Site A core switch, but the rest of the attempts fail to reach for some time, then works again and so forth, meanwhile site B is able to reach it the same time A couldn't, the same thing happens when trying from B when B couldn't reach while A could, this is not a packet loss issue btw, when it pings, it pings perfectly without latency or loss even 10k reps, but when it fails, it fails completely. I understand the issue has to be with the server, but can't figure out what, probably multiple session related, I would like to know if you guys have experienced any such issues, Im not deeply experienced myself but haven't come across this issue.

 Due to issues with roaming profiles, we want to restrict this RemoteApp group to a single session per user as much as possible.
 I'm at the point where I've managed to change the sessions limit so individual session host VM will only accept 1 active/disconnected session per user, which is great cause it means we can't have Mike logging into RDS #4 twice at the same time from 2 clients.
 ​
 However because the Session Hosts are load balanced using a broker, I can't control on which server someone is going to get a session. Which means that even though Mike is logged into RDS #4, there's a possibility he'll also get a new session on RDS #2 if he logs on from a different PC.
 Preferably in this case want session RDS #4 to get disconnected and reactivated on his new client.
 ​
 Does anyone know whether this is possible?

 Also, note the fundamental policy template starts in blocking mode right away..
 And even with 7 days of enforcement period, the automatic policy builder will restart the policy building process everytime it detects new traffic right? How does this work exactly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to run my Rust API web server on Hetzner's cheapest cloud offering called CX11 for 4.55 €/month. Specs are:
 CX11
 vCPU 1 Intel
 RAM 2 GB
 Disk space 20 GB
 Traffic 20 TB
 The backend Rust app (using Actix) is a non-issue - it's under 20MB and no RAM spikes at all even under benchmarking via wrk etc.
 The proxy server will by Nginx which is also a non-issue when it comes to RAM consumption.
 I want to use Ubuntu 22.04 but if it eat too much RAM perhaps I could try Alpine - I want to run things like wkhtmltopdf (this will spike the RAM for a few seconds unfortunatelly) etc. but perhaps that is a non-issue.
 I don't want to use Docker - the 2 GB RAM would be an issue and with one file deployment of the Rust binary app it's not worth it.
 The most important question I have is about the SQL db I will use.
 So, it has to be relational database and I have only a couple of options: MySQL, PostgreSQL and perhaps some forks like MariaDB or something else.
 Can you recommend a DB that is the most RAM efficient under heavy load? I am mostly interested in reads, not so much writes into the DB. As I said it is an API backend that mostly serves JSON via relatively simple selects and an occassional joint here and there - nothing too crazy though.
 I will probably off-load the homepage for not-logged in users and some mostly accessed parts of the app to Redis, but still, I want something that would work relatively well when it comes to the available 2 GB RAM even without Redis - at least from the beginning ;)
 It will be mostly mobile apps accessing the API, so frontend rendering etc. is not the problem here.
 Thanks for your recommendation and advice - especially if you have used Hetzner CX11 servers or some other servers like this with databases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 Recently I have got into I.T, in our warehouse prob( 300-400 people overall) as someone with no IT background. We are working as system administrators even though we do not access to a lot of stuff, we have a HQ group called Central , they have to give permissions for certain stuff( I assue they are level 2 or level 3 ). So recently for preaparation for Black Friday our packing department have been prepared and did some mock test with like 50 packers at the same time. 
 The problem is that as soon as people (30-50 start to work the invoice from our printer gets really slow to print sometimes (1- 2 minutes, normally it takes like 5-10 second).
 We use DLX as a WMS. We have given a list to Central with all the cabinets and sockets that these printers are using so they can monitor it. They said they have not seen any slowness from that part. ok.
 In DLX we have a thing called "Run Task". It basically shows when the sytem processed the order. So if you check the time from the moment you press the print button after you packed an order until the run task actually run you can see the time it took to process it. its quick like couple seconds. ok. 
 And then we have a print server where we have all the printers added ( something like a print host). This is the last idea we have currently to check how long does it take from the DLX to send the information to this print server. Everything we have checked or sent to Central came back as no issues or signs for slowness.
 Also its confusing because during people's breaktime there were like 25 packers only, printing went back to like 5 second. And then after an hour with like 30 or 35 ish people it just slowed down to 1 minute again. ( it is kind of inconsistent.)
 ​
 Does anybody have any other idea what would worth to be checked?

I’ve gone from job to job working various sys admin and cloud roles and they are all the same, public and private sector. Between the overnight maintenance windows, the early morning releases, the horrible on call, the boss who expects you in at your regular time despite being up at 2-4am for maintenance while on call, the sleep deprivation, constant projects and dealing with non technical people with big dreams but no idea how to achieve them so they look to you. I am so done with it all and feel like a failure to my family when I have to leave a job due to absolutely becoming a zombie of a person. 
 I remember being way happier when I worked at McDonald’s as a youth. At least I could go home and do whatever for the rest of the night and not have to worry about work. 
 My most care free time in IT was working as a 3rd tier Support Analyst, just working tickets out of Service Now all day and being on call once every 3 months where you could go years without getting called. I either need to try and do something like that again or change industries completely because IT Infrastructure is not it for me.

They know I'm a junior in this role but I still feel incredibly in over my head, today was my first day and tomorrow I'm going to be doing my first actual tasks/problems, any veteran sysadmins got advice for keeping the anxiety down and also moving relatively quickly, I've already poured heavily over documentation used to run our infrastructure and the architecture of it, it's your standard k8s-docker setup with some virtual machines and bare metal, with a bit of Ansible and ovirt.
 Feeling like I'm going to do something stupid that will get me fired or reveal myself as too incompetent (honestly probably not that justified of a fear considering the company is having a hard time finding people but still and they had no problems with me being a junior but i dunno, expectations are hard to measure!). 
 (My previous work was in security testing, compliance and a small amount of security maintainance/implementation on infrastructure, although not containerised at all, just bare metal servers).

 One of my personal favorite things about IT is, I get to see the amazement on people's faces when I show them something that they rarely get to see or experience. (showed a friend a 2Petabyte Ceph Cluster that I helped create for a company (permission given from the company, of course)) That and I just love tinkering with stuff, its like playing with Legos, there's always something to create, rebuild, make better, etc. There's many reasons why I like IT but those are just the some of the reasons.

 Now they want people coming back to the office. And people are just quitting, especially managers. And when we interview people, we tell them that we want them in 2 days a week. We make them an offer, and they don't even return our calls to accept it.
 My manager is still there, but her boss is gone. All of my manager's peers have left in the last 2 months.
 Everyone says that they're more than willing to come into the office, but only if there is a reason to. There's no point in dragging yourself into the office if you're just going to be on Teams calls and remotely connecting to stuff. You can do all that at home and save yourself the commute.
 There's a rumor they're going to start reviewing badge access logs to make sure people are coming in.
 I'm curious how this is going to end. We're bleeding IT staff every month.

What happens when a link drop/trace disconnect occurs when there are several successors but no FS (all the routes have the same metric)? Is the algorithm not activated and just the next successors take the place of the predecessor, or is the algorithm being ran and the successors are recalculated?
 Edit: Maybe I have not specified enough, I mean such a specific case as in the screenshot. It is a route from R2 to R7, R2 has 3 tracks, all are successors (each link has the same cost) and no FS. If the link between R2 and R3 fails, will one of the two other successors be added to the routing table immediately, or will the algorithm restart and recalculate the routes?

We have a small network with a file server, Unifi edgerouter and UAP 2.4/5 access point. Because of the nature of the nonprofit's work, specialists need to bring their work laptops in and out and switch rooms frequently, and so hardwiring really isn't an option. Recently, users have been getting disconnected from the wifi intermittently in the afternoons between about 2 and 4. I added a second AP to a corner of the office where a lot of interruptions were reported, but it hasn't seemed to help. I've tried different channels, as it is a crowded environment, but no luck, and the APs automatically choose channels in normal operation anyway). I've confirmed that it isn't an issue with the network itself; hardwired devices work fine, and network activity appears normal. The issue is disconnection from the access points. I've spoken to several of our neighbors; a next-door neighbor reports the same thing, the one on the other side doesn't. 
 I'm wondering if there's some kind of RF interference that's causing this, but I'm at a loss as to how to track it down. The issue of whether it's a 2.4ghz vs 5ghz issue is a bit murky to me, since (as is common) the two bands share the same SSID, so it's difficult to know which one a device is connecting to. The building is kind of a beast, so the 5ghz AP doesn't penetrate walls well. In any case, I don't want to confuse users by splitting them up, though.
 How would y'all proceed from here?

Actions to Help Protect Against Russian State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Activity:
From November 2021 through January 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responded to advanced persistent threat (APT) activity on a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization’s enterprise network. During incident response activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple APT groups compromised the organization’s network, and some APT actors had long-term access to the environment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit called Impacket to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Looking to get some help with this device but before I start I just wanted to mention I have some basic networking knowledge and was just given this to figure out and configure. 
 Problem: After setting up the AP with an IP and Name. I assigned a DHCP pool(with gateway & DNS). Everything works fine until I power it off and back on to see if it will come back up and the SSID doesn't broadcast. 
 How I configured: 1. connected to POE+ switch, AP powered on
 2. connected to the AP via putty to view the status
 3. connected to the AP's default SSD
 3. opened https://mywifi.cisco.com/webui/ and logged w/ webui/cisco credentials
 4. Followed the initial config steps with admin account, SSID name and IP for the AP
 5. reconnected to the AP via the new SSID
 6. configured an IP to my laptop of the same subnet and opened the webui via the IP I assigned, logged in with admin I created
 7. created a DHCP pool(assigned gateway and DNS)
 8. removed the static IP and reconnected to see if the DHCP works 
 After those steps it looked to be working fine, until I rebooted it and the SSID is no where to be found.
 Appreciate any help & suggestions

 I have been tasked with finding laptops for new hires and the CEO would like a "range of options" from $100 - $400. Usually, finding laptops is easy. However, looking for laptops in this cheaper, budget range has been difficult. Every list, forum post, recommendation, etc. for employee laptops are all over $400.
 Is anyone here knowledgeable about reliable, lower end budget laptops? I am going to convince the CEO that anything near $100 is not going to work (unless I am wrong here) and we will want something solid closer to the $300 - 400 range.
 Any insights? Thank you in advance. 
 WOW! Thank you for all of the responses everyone - I gained some great insights here.

 In like half of deployments I've seen that the default passwords on printers were not changed.
 I get it, I was guilty of this as a sysadmin as well. "It's just a printer, what damage can it do".
 Well, once I started pentesting, I realized that if a service is setup with credentials in the printer (LDAP, SMTP, SMB, etc) I could point it back at my machine, and capture the credentials.
 Sometimes it's just gives me access to a regular domain account.
 But in several engagements I've used this to priv esc and become domain admin.
 A few examples of how I became domain admin:-The accounts had DCsync privileges, so I could sync all the domain account NTLM hashes and privesc that way-Password reuse and printer service account shared the same password with a domain admin-One service account had domain admin rights
 This isn't a new attack. After I discovered this attack path, I stumbled across a presentation from Defcon 19 (which was 11 years ago) talking about these sort of attacks.
 The remediation is simple though, just change your MFPs' default passwords.

 With which version can I make my requirements:

 - Apply local profile to the user from Azure AD (this should then log in)
 Can someone roughly describe the steps to be taken?

Do some thing get corrected automagically during an upgrade?
 I am mainly talking about historic misconfigurations. Is there any way to really clean this stuff up. Think of the current domain you are running.. who was running it when it was NT4, receptionist?, Some random office guy? What did they do to it? Inexperienced Admins?
 I know I made errors that I had to clean up later. I also had to clean up things I noticed wrong. I am sure I left some dirty socks somewhere as well. 
 Where do these problems come back and bite us in the ass? Is this part of the growth process of a large secure mature network that has someone go through a total clean up of the domain threw some involved process in the manner a domain must be cleaned after a breach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. We are a small company looking to replace our SonicWall. 
 We have three sites : one main site with TZ600 in HA cluster (40 users/computers - 2 esx) and two other sites with TZ300 (5 users/computers - 1 small server and 20 users/computers - 1 small server).
 Our biggest site has a main internet fiber (200 Mbs) with backup link, some VOIP phones with dedicated fiber (20 Mbs). The other two sites only have one internet link each (about 50 Mbs per site).
 The current needs we have/features we use : traffic/content/geo filtering, load balancing for wan interfaces, site to site VPN (with the physical sites and Azure), user VPN, DPI, IDS/IPS.
 In the future I know for sure our CEO will ask us for internet usage reports and such things.
 Management would also love to reduce the cost of the annual licence (budget is max 2000$ for all three sites per year) and even better, go with pfSense and only pay support. Even though we are a small company, I am not convinced with pfSense as I have only seen them in homelabs situation.
 Also Fortinet would be the cherry on top but it is probably too expensive for us ?
 As I am mostly a sys/cloud admin, I am looking for your kind help if you have any recommendations and hope I provided enough details.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I just need an idea or a few and some criticism from someone with experience in PS scripting, if any of you has the patience. I have just a bit of experience with scripting, but mainly simple commands (I don't dare calling them scripts) like get-something|foreach{ do some stuff}. And I composed this first big script that I intend to use in automated AzAD user provisioning. 
 The script will take the employee data (Firstname, lastname, workmail, etc) from the HR System (BambooHR) with an API call and it then creates users/modify them in AzAD using a foreach loop, some identifiers from BambooHR attributes+AzAD attributes and IFs to identify the operations needed to be performed. I also wanted to have logging as good as possible, there are still some things to be improved on this part too. It's not yet completed, this is the first working and tested version, (I did run it in production, yes :) but before I did, I exported every single user attribute/licenses info to a csv and prepared a script to restore everything back to the state using this csv) I will also adjust the documentation based on the final result. I'm also thinking of a better...logical way to go for 3 big IF-s. But I was thinking, what else can I use instead of those many many If-s? I thought of array comparison, but there would still be IF-s....some custom function? Please let me know some suggestions, and how good I'm doing.
 Overall, the script performance looks "ok" from my perspective (the company has less than 150 employees right now) and, when it had to modify about 10 users and create 2 accounts, it took 2 minutes to run. And when it just checked stuff, with applying only 2 modifications, it took 34 seconds.
 Here you can find it
 Thanks a lot!

 I work in IT with a university. My question is, how often should users turn off their workstations? There is alot faculty that work from home and they need their pc on so they could remote in. Im not sure about leaving a computer on 24/7, should i tell them to shut it down at least once a week? 
 Some hate restarting their workstations because it might go to an update mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have an issue we are trying to troubleshoot. Our setup is this....
 Core > 3850 fiber switch > 3560 switch
 All switches are using ISE for tacacs.
 The issue is with the 3rd switch that is not connected directly to the core. It will sometimes let us log in with the usernames we have saved on ISE, and then sometimes those wont work and we will have to use the local account that is setup on the switch as an account of last resort. 
 When we have the login issues, all the switch logs tell us is that authentication has failed with that username. We don't see any logs about losing connection to ISE or anything like that. Just the username authentication failures. 
 When we look at ISE, we do not see the authentication failures, all we see are the successful authentications. So that tells me that when we are having the authentication issues, we some how are losing connection to ISE because these failures are not shown. 
 We are also using ISE for RADIUS and doing client authentication with MAB. Clients are also losing their authentication intermittently. Same thing though, this failure is not shown on ISE.
 This issue only occurs with the switch that is "daisy chained" and not directly connected to the core. And again, nothing in the logs indicating a loss with the ISE server.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be the issue? We are on a webex with TAC at the moment, but seem to not be getting anywhere. My assumption is that the daisy chained switch is some how losing connection to ISE, but again not seeing any logs indicating this. Connection to the switch is not an issue, because like I said , when this issue occurs, I can still reach the switch and login with the local account.

We have one customer where we provided internet for them, when we tested it from the laptop, it worked fine. But when plugging it into the router, it does not work. We tried 6 different routers, from home ones to business ones. We tried to check for any policies with the IT team and everything is alright. We've used the same switch for diff. companies and it worked fine. In fact, we have the same exact setup at a diff. location and it works just fine. The connection is through a microwave link. We've tried to add multiple public IPs, and extend but nothing worked. We contacted our main provider and they said the issue is not from their side (their customer service is non existent) we have 48 hours before the customer cancels their service. the only solution i can think of is to use the server as a router but obv there's a deeper issue. Any help would be HIGHLY appreciated

 I am currently working on onboarding our new OCI environment which will be connected to our On-prem DC via a Layer 2 Cloud Cross Connect that has been provided to us by Megaport. I have configured both BGP on Fast Connect within OCI, and BGP on the 9K that is again hosted on our On-Prem DC. Thus far I am able to ping from the 9K to the OCI side just fine however BGP is stuck in IDLE.. From what I see from parsing through the BGP debugs it looks like a " maximum number of prefixes reached", however, I am unsure of how since I have not set any limiters on this and I am also not sure if this is what is preventing BGP peering to form.. Thanks for any of your provided advice/tips.

 I obviously started with looking up on Google and there's lots of services that look like they would fit the bill, but before I start submitting my email and number to companies for quotes I Thought it would be best off to get the communities advice.
 We are currently a company of 64 users but quickly growing and Ideally looking for the following as minimum:
  
Spam Blocking
 Phishing blocking
 Email Spoofing
 A services that allows for easy scalability as we grow with numbers.
  
If anyone can recommend a product and price per user then I'd be eternally grateful.

 I have installed updates via wsus before but there is currently a filter created for the updates so all I do every month is approve the updates for the applicable servers. If I am dealing with a new server, presumably I need a lot of updates. So do you put this new vm in its own group, then go into the wsus and approve all the updates I need for this 1 group? (that way only this pc gets all these updates) how do I know which updates will need to be installed? I figured I would then remove the pc from this group and put it into the permanent group I use for Server 2019 computers.
 I am asking you guys so that I at least have the right idea. I can figure out how to implement it.
 I need clarification because on my own personal computer, when it's brand new, it usually gets a bunch of updates. I imagine this is the same way that things work for a brand new windows server. Perhaps this is not the case?
 thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We're currently in the process of moving to 2022 server. The new servers have been promoted as DCs and are replicating with no issues. 
 When running repadmin /showrepl and repadmin /replsummary there are no issues. But when running DCDiag we see:
 Starting test: DFSREvent
 There are warning or error events within the last 24 hours after the
 SYSVOL has been shared. Failing SYSVOL replication problems may cause
 Group Policy problems.
 ......................... DC1 failed test DFSREvent
 ​
 We're wanting to move the FSMO roles across. However not sure where to proceed with the following errors. 
 We get a warning first:
 The DFS Replication service is stopping communication with partner DC2 for replication group Domain System Volume due to an error. The service will retry the connection periodically. 
 Additional Information: 
 Error: 9036 (Paused for backup or restore) 
 Connection ID: 
 Replication Group ID: 
 Followed by an informational: (This happens about 20 seconds later)
 The DFS Replication service successfully established an inbound connection with partner DC2 for replication group Domain System Volume. 
 Additional Information: 
 Connection Address Used: DC2
 Connection ID: 
 Replication Group ID: 
 ​
 My main concern is if we move the FSMO with these current warnings and something fails we're stuck.
 A google hasn't really brought up much advices.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be great.

 Thought I would share. I bought my first server today. It is old, but I'm super happy with it. Only ever rented hardware in DCs so never had the opportunity to interact with physical servers. I plan on just using it to learn. I am only 20 and saved for a bit to get it.
 If anyone wants to give some advice, tips and tricks, etc., or even things to do that are interesting, would love to hear it! Very passionate about hardware, hosting, etc.
 For those interested specs and photos are below :)

 Would be good to know how people are blocking Windows 11 who are managing many devices.
 We use N-Able RMM Patching which has not been successful in blocking Windows 11 and when we called support they simply provided a script to set the target release.
 Many of our clients are Intune but we've chosen to use N-Able for patching primarily to cover third party patching but we're unsure if we enable the Feature Update Ring in Intune whether that would work in stopping Windows 11. I think we found if N-Able is on the device it takes over all elements of the patching aspect and ignores Intune.
 In any case we are meandering options but would be good to know what you do.
 Another question - if you set the target release on a device does that prompt it to update immediately or does that just say to the device you can only go up to this release as and when its made available?
 ​
 Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wasn't sure if this was the best place to ask this, but let's give it a go!
 I have a client that uses a few hosted internal HTTP sites. These sites are also forwarded on from the router so external access is possible. They have now requested for the sites to be secure, and use HTTPS (when accessing externally via the forwarded port) as that complies with their external IT team's policies. I am aware you need an SSL certificate to do this, and probably need one with a SAN of the external IP address.
 Where do you install this though? On the router? On each of the HTTP web servers?
 All help would be appreciated!

Asked the recruiter who I was meeting (ie role on company) and didn't get a reply. Yesterday, completely blindsided by a network admin who leaned heavily into security. I'm a bit worried that I've come across a bit foolish, as if I'd known who they they were, I'd have been better prepped.
 Am I right to be worried, or was this person just an extreme case? I've had 1 other interview at this stage and it wasn't as bad, more like what technologies I know etc.
 Also, is this amount of interviews at this stage normal (based in EMEA)

I did this a couple a days ago, and ever since that I am unable to use this account to do administrative tasks on my computer.
 My admin account work on other computers, and other accounts work on my computer (as long as I remember to activate my PIM role before I try to do an administrative task). 
 My computer is an Azure AD only device managed with Intune. I have tried several reboots and made sure to activate my PIM role before i try to use the account. Normally I use "run as" on my administrative task, but the same issue occurs even when I log in to the computer with the admin account. After doing some testing the same issue appears when logging in other computers without enabling the PIM role.
 Based on this I believe that my admin account is somhow cached on my device, and it believes that it is not an admin. Is there a way to make my computer know that my admin user has admin rights (hopefully remote and without admin access)?

They connected to the jack on the wall, but were unable to get out to the internet. We can plug any other device into this port and receive a DHCP address and ping other devices on the LAN and out to internet. Whenever this desktop is plugged in, it has always received the same IP address even after removing reservation. Could be lease time I guess. The only switches I found onsite are Cisco SGs that dont seem to have any port security or port channel configs. Another weird thing is when the desktop was plugged into the problem port, the firewall's arp table shows the device's MAC address. 
 The DHCP address its receiving is fine and from correct server. I tried a static and same issue. Also the desktop works fine elsewhere. Its just this desktop with this port. Very confused. Looking for ideas. New to environment and past employees are gone. No idea when switches were last powercycled, but I do have CLI access.

 I wanted to see if anyone has run into a similar situation. 
 I have a setup where I am using a core transport router for aggregation into an edge router. Both are handed off using an ASR 9k. 
 We recently swapped the ASR 9k (running IOS XR) for the transport out from an ASR 900 (running IOS XE). 
 Out of around 50 mpls LDP l2vpn's, 7 or so would not come up on the new router, so we had to hand them off on a different router that is in the same DC. The router that works with the remote peers is an IOS XE device. 
 Everything that we can see is matching (MTU, tag manipulation, etc.) 
 The xconnect/psuedowires are coming up/establishing, but are not performing two-way traffic on the connection. We can see this in some cases first-hand since we own the connections ourselves on both sides of the interfaces. 
 I have also started a TAC case to see if we have encountered some bug in the code, etc. 
 Thanks!

Therefore, I wondered if anyone here had recent job interview with them and would mind sharing some advice on how to ace it or at the very least your strategy for passing the technical interview. Some folks in Glasdoor says that the q&a is quite difficult.
 It appears that some of the Q&A require a deep understanding of the TCP even the required years of experience are equal to associate level. lol I definitely need to prepare for and refresh on that.... already forgot some foundations and basics. :) Do I need to write any code for the automation part, or can I just explain the method and procedure (ex func, modules etc).
 Ive been watching a lot of youtube vids, and I'm wondering if I should just use the Star approach or if I also need to have the 16 Leader Principles in my pocket for the phone interviewer or for the Loop interview.
 They say that, before the pandemic they sponsored the applicant's flight and accommodation to Sydney for a face-to-face interview.. 5-6hrs interview haha... but has been replaced by this loop interview which is virtual :(.
 Anyways, whatever happens, it seems like this will be a positive experience.

 Why the 10G-SR was showing down/down despite the rx was -3db? The duplex was full and the speed was 10Gbps. I can see the red light at the end of the cable.
 The working one is 1G SX and the switch interface being used was the "ten1/1/x" instead of g1/1/x. 
 What does it mean if the SFP+ SR not showing any light from its tx port? Does the LR modules show light on its tx port?

 We're rolling out remote access to 100+ remote workers at a health care organization (mid-size and fast growing). Their different offices are geographically separated and each office has an-prem SQL based application isolated behind a firewall. They are using Fortinet for their firewall stack. Using VPN based approach gave pretty poor results in terms of launching the application. It took about 10-15 minutes just to load the application over VPN. Whereas in normal cases it takes about 10-15 seconds to fully load the application.
 I came across some other technologies like ZTNA, SDP, and SASE but I'm not very familiar with these solutions, however we're open to any ideas. 
 Any suggestions on how to improve performance and eliminate as much latencies as possible would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently I've had to migrate the VM servers into a new hypervisor. 
 The issue I have is that I've only been with this company for a year, and everyone that knew anything about them is long gone. There is no documentation on each VM anywhere. 
 So obviously the simplest answer is shut it down and when some one complains then I'll know, but I would like not to do that. 
 I have to shut down the server for the migration, but I would like to know what services I'm bring down. Obviously there's simple ones like AD, DNS and DHCP, but others are leaving me puzzled. Some have a webserver service installed, but there's no real files with any information saved in the server. I used the comman netstat to see traffic and there really isn't anything and if there is its not enough information to go off of. 
 So what advice do you guys have when it comes to figuring out what the purpose of a server is?

The rub is they need to find documents containing T:\, and Windows will not process the backslash. Every document has T: in the header for the phone number, and even if I search (quotes included) "T:\" documents with only T: show up. I've pulled out all my hair and I'm about to start on my eyebrows. All of the index settings are correct, folder settings are correct, but Windows still search T: instead of T:.

There is already a pre-existing topology and I was given just excel sheets for the various IP addresses, point-to-point connections, and usernames and passwords for the whole setup (although it's useful, it's still not the most put together but I am grateful).
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a potential, better way to keep track of everything, and maybe I even get to see the whole topology, virtually, so I can have a better idea of how everything is interconnected? I was thinking of something like one of the two major network simulation tools. How have you kept track of your environment?

 Just wanted to let everyone know that if you're using PDQ without LAPS, that's a method I'll usually use to privesc from local admin to domain admin.
 I've only been pen testing for a couple of months and I've already used PDQ to privesc in a few clients environments already. Basically every place I've seen PDQ. Sure, PDQ added LAPS functionality somewhat recently, but I haven't seen a client that has used LAPS with PDQ. Usually they'll create a service account with domain admin rights and that's what they'll use for PDQ.
 I tried bringing this up a couple of months ago in /r/pdq, but they did not want to hear it. I loved using PDQ as a sysadmin, but I think its users need to know this.
 Edit: typo
 Also, here’s the link from PDQ on how to setup PDQ with LAPS.

 We have a very old ethernet switch: 3COM Baseline Switch 2924-SFP Plus (it was installed in the year 2009) and one of the ports has this SFP transceiver:
 Sfp transceiver
 My boss asked me to replace this switch and to accomplish this task, I need to know the type of transceiver.
 I plan to turn off the switch, disconnect the fiber optic patch cord and extract the transceiver to take photos of the patch cord and the transceiver.
 I have never in my life handled fiber optics sfps and patch cords and I don't have any spares to replace them in case of problems.
 Now my questions:
 ¿Is this the proper, safe way to handle the sfp and fiber optics patch cord, without harming them?
 ¿If if fine to assume that when I insert the transceiver, connect the patch cord and turn on the switch everything is going to work again?
 Thanks in advance for your kind help.
 ​
 EDIT1: My boss told me that this fiber optic link was installed 20 to 22 years ago and this was not the first switch where it was connected.
 EDIT2: This a better photo of the fiber optic:

 EDIT3: Accoding to web page of the switch, the link is 1000M of speed:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heads up, this is a theoretical design for my College Network Design class. 
 So we were tasked to create a network for our assigned business. We got assigned a sales company, 50 users. In our original design, we have a PA-820 doing the internal routing along with it's firewall duties. One of my classmates was giving me shit about how it wouldn't be able to handle internal traffic for 50 users and handle the SSL/TLS Decryption and other features. I'm not sure if he's blowing smoke up my ass or what... I would like to try and prove him wrong but I don't really have any metrics as to what kind of internal traffic we would be handling - as it's all theoretical. 
 Which leads me to my question. Is it common practice for small / medium sized businesses to buy separate equipment for their router and firewall? Is it really not reasonable to have a FW of that caliber do the internal routing? At my workplace we have multiple branch offices with 20-80 people and our older MX64's handle it just fine.

 Customer needs a site to site VPN set up. Policy based ikev2.
 Internal networks are say 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.100.0/24
 Remote site consists of 2 IPs - say 192.168.10.10 and 192.168.10.20.
 The problem is that the remote site will only accept traffic coming from 172.16.0.0/28 .
 I'd like any suggestions on how to accomplish this inside the ASA. I'm at a loss of how to re-address traffic from 10.0.1.0 / 10.0.100.0 to 172.16.0.0 before it heads to the outside interface.
 Additionally due to the size discrepancies of the 10 vs 172 networks - it seems like it would somehow need to involve a nat dynamic interface type setup...

 And we see that everyday.
 People have been doing this at scale in the modern western workforce for decades, such as those with retirement on the horizon or people who only come to work to shop online and forward email. Add into that mix all the office politics and nepotism, and it's ubiquitous.
 If you suffer an injury, are recovering from surgery, a personal situation occurs (death of a loved one, divorce, new baby, etc.), anything along those lines, obviously that may demand more time away from work and/or less ability to perform the work when doing it. I understand quiet quitting to be checking out just because.
 I'm open to discussion here. If there's no clear definition, then we are arguing points on entirely different concepts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been chasing down this strange issue where devices randomly become inaccessible. So far I've had about a dozen different devices (NAS, Printers, Moxas) in different vlans in the past week. We notice suddenly we are not able to ping a device. If you get on the same vlan, you can ping it. When I check the network switch, it does not show a mac address associated with that device. Unplugging and plugging back in doesn't work neither does changing to another static IP (same vlan). If you change the vlan and slap on a different IP, it'll ping; then if you change it back to the original vlan, it'll still ping. 
 The one thing in common with all of these issues is that the mac address does not appear on the switch it's connected to (different switches/models/locations). The switches all connect to a router, which also does not show the mac address. So I'm assuming since that information isn't anywhere, when I ping a device, the router doesn't know where to send it. Anyone ever deal with this?

 I know there are lots of post about different firewalls and heck I have used most of them myself.
 I am in a rare position where I am building out some new infrastructure and the C suite truly just wants to provide me the budget to purchase the best of what I need. 
 I am leaning towards Palo as its just a rock solid product and in my experience it has been great. Their lead times are a little out of control so I do need to look at other options if that doesn't pan out. 
 My VAR is pushing a juniper solution but I have never used juniper and I'm not really sure I want to go down that rabbit hole. 
 All that being said if you had a blank check which product would you go with an why? 
 ​
 I should mention we are a pretty small shop. We will be running an MPLS some basic routing (This isn't configured yet so I'm not tied to any specific protocol as of now), VPN's and just a handful of networks. We do have client facing web servers and some other services but nothing so complex that it would rule any one enterprise product out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Within our datacenter we use a lot of SR optics and OM4 patch cables. I'm currently planning on migrating a machine from using 1g copper to 10g fiber. I'm running into the decision on what optics/cabling to go with.
 Are there any real advantages/disadvantages to using SR/LRM Singlemode/Multimode for short distances within a datacenter?
 The cost is very similar so that shouldn't be a factor.

 I have 5 AP's on campus. For safety reasons, they do not have cat 6 because switches cannot be fielded, so I have one root AP and 4 client AP's that bridge wirelessly back to the root AP with line of sight. Now I need to add more AP's but they are too far from the root bridge and no line of sight. However, they do have line of sight to and are close enough to some of the client/non-root AP's. Is there a way I can set up an AP in wireless repeater mode that peers to the non-root bridge while the non-root bridge maintains it's wireless bridge connection to the root bridge?
 i.e. Repeater AP-------------Non-Root Bridge AP-----------------Root Bridge AP--------------------Core.
 The only cable involved here is the on on the root bridge back to the core. Everything else would be wireless peering.

 I know how to restrict users to NOT be able to log into RDS, but what if I want them ONLY to be able to log into the RDS server?
 You can't use the "Log On To..." option within AD as it appears that with RDS it also requires the user login access on in connecting PC too - but these users are remote (WFH). 
 So how do I go about allowing remote users ONLY access to the RDS server?
 Thanks, and I'm going to go get some more coffee.

 Other switches have taken the update without question, but I can't find anything specific about this one that would explain it.
 A previous update attempt failed with "./fw-install.sh: line 57: can't create /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update/update.log: nonexistent directory" but I fixed that with 'mkdir /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update' followed by 'touch /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update/update.log' -- however I suspect that this indicates some wrongness.
 If anyone had any ideas I'd be very grateful - needless to say this system is not under any form of support.

 For our purposes we're looking to mostly manage vendor privileges and a handful of "Super Users" who occasionally need admin access to update schematic and map software we use. AD integration is a must, but it would also be nice to have a solution that will play nice with our SolarWinds ticketing system. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I was able to RDP into a domain controller to verify I wasn't locked out. Tried hitting multiple file shares, no dice. I was prompted for user creds. My older Surface was recently upgraded, so I verified the same failures on that as well. 
 All told, three 22H2 laptops seem to have a major issue with domain authentications. The Surface was upgraded, so I was able to roll back to 21H2, and all of the issues were resolved. 
 Has anyone encountered this yet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days back, I came across a setting to restrict user access to the administration portal. After checking, I realize how easily we let users access the organization's information without any privileges. To make you all aware of this setting, I came up with a blog that includes the steps to restrict users' access to Azure AD data and PowerShell modules. But, I got a negative impact from a few Redditors saying that it is invalid and nothing can be changed with this setting as it is a directory.
 Though it is a directory, do non-admins really need to access the organization's information? Even one single vulnerability can easily break the security chain nowadays. Isn't it? But, the comments made me conclude that restricting user access is not as significant as other security measures. 
 But today, I came across an update from MS on the recent two zero-day vulnerability issues and the required mitigation steps. Their strong recommendation is to disable the non-admin access to the remote PowerShell module. Now, I have a question, Isn't it necessary to restrict non-admins?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Hope I'm in the correct subreddit. I just had an idea yesterday, hoping to confirm it here.
 My home only has copper cables (no fiber possible) which prevents me to subscribe to any internetplan above 100Mbit/s.
 I've been thinking of buying a 5G-Router which in my country/location achieves roughly 2Gbit/s down (I know that latency is different over 5G than Fiber but this is something I'm willing to accept). 
 The issue is, that 99% of routers I've seen don't have a SFP port but only 1Gbit LAN-Ports and the ones that do have an SFP-Port cost more than 1600€.
 Now, my idea is to buy a 5G-Router like this one from MikroTik https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g . I have a SuperMicro CSE-118 lying around with an Intel 340-T4 (Quad Port RJ45) and an Intel X520-DA2 (SFP+) in it which I would use as an pfSense Server.
 Would it be possible to connect 4 Ports of the 5G Router to the Server, link aggregate them, connect the SFP-Port to a switch, and distribute the whole possible bandwith of 2Gbit to other devices?
 This is just a rough idea and I haven't thought about possible hickups (or none came to my mind thinking about this)
 Thank you all in advance!

 Now I need to find a setup that can work like that. Do you guys have any good suggestions to solve this?
 I was thinking maybe a Surface Go tablet with a pen that is domain joined then cast it to the display... Or a secondary touch display that people can connect to their laptop, and that is mirrored to the big screen...

 For a trading application, I need to do an HTTP request to a certain endpoint, which in turn resolves to a CloudFlare IP. This CloudFlare IP is "hosted" in the NWAX Internet Exchange Point in Portland, and I would like to have the lowest latency possible to this IP. Right now I have my sever hosted in AWS Oregon and when I do traceroute I can see it does multiple hops to reach this CloudFlare IP.
 How can I reduce latency and even get to this IP address with only one hop? (I know this is possible since other people connecting to the same IP are already doing it) Will I need some kind of colocation service within NWAX, a cable, or a direct connection? (Sorry I'm a big networking noob)
 Thank you.

 Currently, we can see similar attacks made by tricky cybercriminals in almost every place, be it on-premise or the cloud. Every crime initiates with going over all the organization information to uncover the weakest links in the security chain to creep in their attack. Thus, their key target would be standard users, as getting their credentials using password spray or purchasing via cybercriminal economy becomes effortless.
 Few days back, I wrote a blog with the steps to restrict users' access to the Azure AD portal. When considering Office 365 environment, the organization info will be scattered and viewable through multiple places like Azure AD portal, PowerShell, MS Graph, etc.But, many Redditors commented it was invalid and unnecessary as it is a directory. 
 Though it is a directory and non-admins have access to it, do they really use portal.azure.com or PowerShell to view Azure information? Even a single loophole make the attack worse. Moreover, why shouldn't we restrict them from accessing crucial information when we can do it? What's the point in letting the weakest security link be active right before our eyes? Isn't it essential to restrict them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody, i have an issue with some Aruba CX Virtual.10.07.0004 version.
 To give some context, i'm making a lab on EVE-NG to create static VXLAN tunnels. I made IPv4 underlay with OSPF and BGP, and everything works fine, I can reach every Routing devices. Also the VXLAN tunnels seems to be up, with the command "sh int vxlan 1" i can see the other vtep-peer IP adn MAC address on the other side of the topology. I'm going through the process following guides and the official Aruba documentation https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.07/PDF/5200-7890.pdf
 Onto the switches which are vteps i've created vlan 50 and associated it to vni 100. Then i went on the interfaces where i have VirtualPCs attached, i put them in "no routing" and then into "vlan access 50" (obv i enter "no shutdown" command). So this is only L2 configuration, no routing interested here. I gave ip addresses to the vpcs 172.16.0.10/24 and 172.16.0.15 /24. They're in the same subnet but CANNOT ping, giving me "host not reachable" as feedback.
 I replicated the vlan configuration on Aruba CX 10.04.0001 version (which NOT support vxlan interfaces) and worked, the vpcs can ping each other.
 Is this a bug for the Aruba CX Virtual 10.07.0004 version or i have misconfigured something? Anyone had same issue? 
 [EDIT] Probably i can confirm it is a BUG. I downloaded 10.05 version, that support vxlan, recreated vlan scenarios and they can ping.

 Windows Server 2019 running as a VM on VMWare sporadically loses network connection. The icon goes to the yellow exclamation point, saying it has no internet and I am not even able to ping the networks' gateway address. The way to "solve" it is by disabling, and enabling the network device. This immediately brings up the network device again and I can ping everything. I have checked that the power settings will not put the device to sleep (which should any way wake up when I log in via the console) . I cannot find ANYTHING in event viewer (probably looking in the wrong place) that would indicate why this happens. There are no events/alarms in VMware either.
 I am at a loss and would appreciate any help I can get.

 What makes me love it is that i can easily add a mail as task. 
 My question is what else do you use to manage your day-to-day tasks and is there any form of notification you can get when you set a reminder on a task? Does it also notify you what your tasks are for the day?

 I'll try keep the story short, I found out that when MTU size is 1500 for IPv6 interface I have problems (some sites unreachable or takes forever to open, speed test on speed.measurementlab.net is abyssal) and if I set it to 1490 it is fixed. The problem is thought, that when I use the command:
 netsh interface ipv6 set subinterface "Ethernet 2" mtu=1490 store=persistent
 it works great, but after a few minutes it is back to 1500 and everything starts breaking again.. Does anybody know how I can make sure it stays 1490 ? I guess there's some "smart" functionality in windows that resets it for some reason ?
 P.S. The interface/subinterface is a "Remote NDIS compatible device" (I'm sharing my 5G mobile internet from my smartphone via USB Tethering if that gives any context.

 ​
 As of saturday all of the VM's on a single Hyper-V host have lost the ability to connect to the internet. Nothing has changed, no updates, no nothing. Eventviewer seems to be clean.
 The Hyper-V host has internet connectivity and we can ping the VM's from the host and from the VM's to the host but that's it. We have checked DNS (it never is DNS but everything in me is screaming it is...), LAN settings, everything... However we still cannot seem to find the issue.
 We even went as far to try and add google DNS or open DNS to one of the servers DNS server to no avail.
 ​
 Any pointers?
 ​
 EDIT (mostly for laughter)...: Router settings somehow got reset and was blasting DHCP over the network. This blocked everything. Turning DHCP off and restarting the servers solved everything. Still weird how nothing about this showed up in eventviewer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, I read about 802.11y-2008, including the FCC's "light licensing" scheme.
 Do actual, off-the-shelf products that someone can go and purchase as a semi-normal "off the shelf" item actually EXIST? Like, say (in descending order of sophistication & usability):
  
802.11n/ac to 802.11y-2008 router/bridge (so, two could connect to each other via 802.11y-2008, then "normal" wi-fi/ethernet devices could connect to one & communicate with devices connected to the other
 
PCIe (or mPCIe) 802.11y-2008 network card with working drivers for Windows & Linux (so, you could build a PC, install a pair of network cards... one for wi-fi or ethernet, one for 802.11y-2008, install Linux, and configure it AS a homebrew router/bridge).
 
Any half-baked (but working) FCC-approved module that can do 802.11y-2008 & interface via something like SPI, i2c, etc? Yeah, really scraping the bottom of the barrel here...
 
 Once or twice a year, I get in a new mood to see whether 802.11y-2008 finally exists yet. Every time, it seems like 802.11y-2008 has never actually existed anywhere besides as a theoretical paper standard. 
 Am I wrong?
 Example use case: splitting the cost of rarely-needed Starlink with a dozen or so people within a mile or two, shared via 802.11y-2008 backhaul, to bring the per-user-per-month cost down to something sane enough to get "for the hell of it" when some future hurricane knocks the local cellular network out of commission for days or weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: Thank you for the replies. I will ask for a change to cat 6, (he can say yes or no, then it's on him). They're going to work stations mostly but I just added some meeting rooms, etc., unspecified what actual devices they'll be using, assuming a PC per person. I'll do 2 per workstation. Cost isn't an issue as it's fake and the budget is almost irrelevant, just need to justify the design. 
 I'm in a networking course and part of the class is to design a medium-sized business network. We have never covered the logistics of physically laying out cables, business standards, parts necessary, etc. yet all of this is required for the assignment. So I apologize for this low level question but I have 0 real-world experience. The assignment specifies cat5e.
 My question is, when running the cat5e cables out, is there a standard number of cables per destination (to rooms, workstations, etc.), or should it be exactly as many as needed? Is it 1:1 end component per cable (like if a room is expected to have 5 PCs, should there be 5 cat5s, extra? twice as many?)?
 I've tried googling this and watched videos of people but I still haven't figured out a specific answer. I've read all the rules, I think this question is allowed. You don't have to explain it like I'm 5, I just literally don't know what real businesses do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've not worked with a lot of Network Teams directly, but I'm noticing they always seem to be very defensive and a bit isolationist with other departments.
 Is this a common theme everywhere? Or just a specific trend I've encountered? 
 If this is common, I'm guessing it's because everybody is always quick to blame "the network" and spending half their time proving that the faults are in fact. Not a network problem. Which I understand, it's just a frustrating when they get cagey, especially as once we're off work topics they tend to open up and actually talk to you easily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sys Admins of Reddit it’s been a year since I learned how to check the uptime on our company laptops. This year I learned that many help tickets come from users who go days, weeks, and months without restarting or shutting down their computers.
 Some insist they are shutting down, but the uptime logs states different. The high score I recorded so far is 135 days of uptime. I’ve had users complain they’re falling behind because of their computers performance speed. Users who don’t restart because restarting takes forever to boot. Users who insist they tried restarting multiple times before reaching out to the help desk. There are many examples but my favorite come from power users who try to resolve the problem without restarting thus making the issue more complex.
 I share with you all my journey of enlightenment. Though it may sound annoying, I love my career field.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone said sub going downhill thought I'd post this? Anyone use the sysinternal? 
 I use them at work and they've always come in useful. While working I'll sometimes put Mark Russinovich Case of the Uxexplained talks on and listen to them in background. Nearly all the time I'll suddenly hear a bit I've never noticed before.
 Remember in the old company I was in we had a weird issue on laptops only. Still on XP (they were behind. Was in about 2012) The user would go to explorer and the laptops would freeze for about 5 mins. Then eventually the network drives would appear. I'd grab process monitor traces where I could but instead of giving me time to look our manager would say "Just rebuild them. Don't waste time". Rebuilding them was a cocking waste of time.
 Eventually her own laptop got hit with the issue just as she was going on leave. So convinced her to let me look at hers. Ran process monitor as it happened but couldn't see anything obvious so ran process explorer. Just like in Task Manager you could see explorer at 50% but we all know task manager is useless. Looked into the explorer deeper with procexp and could see one .dll it was using running at 50%
 Ooo, could it be that? The .dll was being used by PGP the software we used to encrypt the laptops. Googled what the .dll did. All it did was scan the network looking for encrypted files so it could change their icon. We never used encrypted files so wasn't needed & apparently there were rare issues with it. So I unregistered it.
 Problem solved. Now instead of having to rebuild the laptops that took quite a while, I could fix them in under 5mins.
 I still take traces of issues wherever I can to look at them later. Started to build up a collection now and keep notes with the traces where I used the tools to fix issues.

 https://i.imgur.com/s5Bkwhj.png
 The AS has two networks, but for testing purposes I am announcing them in different VMs,
 VM1 advertises fdad:23e:f50::/48
 VM2 advertises fdba:54:32::/48
 Between VM1 and VM2 I have a wireguard tunnel and can reach/ping the networks
 In VM3 I would like to use network fdba:54:32::2/64, I have a wireguad tunnel between VM2 and VM3 and I can ping/reach the IP's.
 The problem I have is that from VM1 I can't reach VM3 and viceversa, this is my ospf config:
 VM2 configuration:
 protocol ospf v3 wg6 { ipv6 { export all; }; area 0 { interface "wg.4242421477"; interface "wg.stub"; }; } 
 VM3 configuration
 protocol ospf v3 wg6 { ipv6 { export all; }; area 0 { interface "wg.stub"; interface "ens192"; }; } 
 From VM3 (the stub) This is the output of show route for the IP In VM1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I've been following this sub for a while but I have never posted anything.
 I request the help of a good soul to understand :) 
 Let me detail the situation : I am currently building a game server with i9 10850k and I am looking for a motherboard. I have choosen one, the SuperMicro X12SCA-F (pictured here) but I have some questions about adding a 10 GB network card on it.
 I have already an ASUS NVMe PCIe x16 Card, which allows me to add up to 4 NVMe Drives (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 lanes) destined to be mounted on the first PCIe slot (X16).
 Consequently, the 2nd PCIe x16 slot will be disconnected. Which leaves me one PCIe x4 Slot.
 I have found this Intel x550 T1 PCIe 3 x4 that seems to be ok to pair with, but I have 2 questions before I click to buy it :
 1 – How will a NIC plugged on this slot affect the latency of my internet connection since it is linked to the MB chipset (PCH) and not directly to the CPU ?
 2 – Is this slot shared with the M.2 slot or anything else ? In other words, do I have to expect some troubles or bottleneck from using this slot for my purpose ?
 Thanks a lot for your reply!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I'm the proud owner (haha) of a VPS that I'm intending to use as a thin client to access my machines over the net. So far, after checking my options, I'm leaning towards a solution including a VPN (probably OpenVPN over Wireguard due to the firewalls), Guacamole, and a Let's Encrypt autorenewal system to SSL' the whole thing.
 Process would be : connect machine A to VPN, use Guacamole on VPS, use VPN on VPS to connect to machine A.
 I'm now pondering what would be the best solution to handle this - and I like Docker quite a bit. So I'm asking here if there is a "full solution" already available for Docker (for what I searched, it's always "bits" : either there is VPN + Guacamole, either Guacamole + LetsEncrypt, etc. but not the whole thing), if I should install it on the machine without Docker, or if I should make my own Dockerfile.
 This is considering I want to set up some OTP (at least) to guard the thing off.
 What do you guys think? What would you suggest? Is there something easier?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 apparently there is a function in the MS Office applications to send an email with the spreadsheet directly from the application (now I know it).
 Last month (a week after the August patches were applied) the first user from company A complains that this function does not work and an authentication window appears. -> enter AD credentials -> "general error - restart microsoft excel", window appears again. Tried domain-netbios\username, username@domain-fqdn and username only. Since it's not really a critical function, just dragging and dropping the file from File Manager into Outlook, I decided to put the ticket on hold until I have time to investigate.
 Today (Sunday) the 2nd manager of company B called me that this is not working, tried the same -> no success.
 My findings so far:
 - All systems with issues are Windows 2016 Server with Office 2016 (sometimes 32 bit, sometimes 64 bit), September Windows and Office patches applied, both RDS farms and Citrix systems.
 - The issue may have been introduced with the August patches and has not been fixed with the September patches.
 - Sending an email from Word works fine, Outlook opens and the user can write their message.
 - it's not user specific it's maschine-wide
 - it seems that only customers with on prem exchange have problems, IMAP / POP seems fine, exchange online is not used by our customers, so i can't test.
 - Googling was not really helpful -> only old articles with reinstalling Office.
 ​
 Does anyone else have a similar problem? Anyone have any ideas ?
 ​
 Edit: All systems are fully OnPrem with also fully patched DCs; If I add an pop / imap account to the outlook profile and make it the default one everything works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have just spend a whole day trying (and failing) to implement an internal CA setup. One offline Root and one intermediary to issue certs. I was following one or two guides I found on the internet.
 Turns out, internet outdates way too quickly. A test cert I issued to a website got outright rejected by Google Chrome (with no option to move forward) despite having the whole cert chain imported to my system. 
 I ran a cert lint tool on the certs using online (https://crt.sh/lintcert) tool, and it spew out so many errors, I was questioning my ability as a sysadmin. 
 I won't go into details of what the errors are since they are pointless at this stage. But stuff like mandatory Subject alternative names, and the abolishment of CNs, requirement for policy extensions, are some of the few things that have changed over the past few years, and none of the guides I used bothered to address any of this either.
 Hence, my question is, do any of you guys have a good reference guide that I can follow to create an internal CA the way the internet overlords intended in the current day and age, since apparently all the guides I have followed on the internet are all very much outdated. 
 And yes, I am aware I can bypass these warnings by manual adding to chrome, and using secret codes or whatever, but remember that this is going to be used in a real production environment so such work arounds are not a permanent solution. 
 P.S. For OpenSSL only please. I don't want to touch Windows ADCS.

 Going to be implementing a Root CA with ICAs for a company network and need some advice.
 The Root CA will be offline (it will live within XCA) and the ICA will be a Windows Enterprise CA.
 The certs will mainly be issued for machine auth, smart card auth and simple https web servers.
 What are the best practices today with regards to key type and cert expiry? Is RSA-2048 enough? I was thinking of going EC (ed25519) but apparently this has compatibility problems.
 How long does my RCA and ICA expiry need to be?
 I've seen the occasional 99 year RCA expiry but that can't be the right way to do things.
 I know that individual certs for websites can't be more than 398 days, but how about the rest?
 Would love to hear what you guys are doing.
 Thank you so much!

Something I’ve been wanting to do recently is see if it might be possible to write a custom host-based IDS in Python to analyze capture files for “indicators of compromise”. I was wondering if there are any straightforward parsing methods I could apply to a capture file that might simulate an IDS but instead using Pyshark? Maybe I just need to look into Wireshark forensics and copy those techniques? I’m new to all of this so if I sound naive, it’s because I am. If this sounds ridiculous or infeasible please let me know.

 I work at a hospital where we have multiple Nurses/Doctors signing into multiple computers and not logging out after their done for the day and account lockouts are a problem when it comes time for password changes or forgotten passwords. 
 Unfortunately turning off "switch user" is not an option as much as I'd love to. 
 There is an option in group policy for this exact problem but it only exists for Remote Desktop Servers... Great.
 Policy for Reference:
 Computer Configuration=> Administrative Templates=>Windows Components=>Remote Desktop Services=>Remote Desktop Session Host=>Session Time Limits.

 Any input would be much appreciated, Cheers Legends

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So there will be a central server to which all the configured systems will send their system data which will be analyzed and displayed visually. This is the main goal of the project.
 ​
 What different data can be collected from a given computer system and represented as JSON to be sent to the central server periodically ?
 ​
 I've been able to come up with the following list till now:
 - Hostname
 - OS
 - OS version/kernel version
 - Total disk space
 - Available disk space
 - IP address
 - Open ports
 - Current running processes
 - Battery percentage
 - CPU utilization over the last "x" hours
 - Users
 ​
 What else can be added ? It's for a group project and there are no fixed criteria

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I know... it was an old Drobo that I got from my previous workplace. Does anyone know if there is another vendor's NAS that has the ability for me to just move the disks into their device and recover the array? If not it wasn't the most important data in the world and I have cloud backups of the important stuff, but it's quite a bit to download. 
 It's a 5 bay Drobo 5N, so I'm looking to replace it as well. Something like a Synology or QNAP. Any suggestions? If someone tells me TrueNAS is a possibility I'll do that as well, I've been looking for a reason to build a new server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working in IT for a while now, about 10 years ago I started my apprenticeship.
 And for the first time, I honestly feel like I am being paid what I am worth!
 I start Monday and it feels great, I have had a few roles in that time and each time I felt like I went for a “safe” role and when I started I soon realised that I could do a lot more than my job description. (Mainly think that is because some job job descriptions are far more broader than you actual responsibilities, if I saw SQL database, I would assume I needed to be a SME)
 Now I have gained some pretty desirable skills (such as PowerShell, Microsoft 365 expert, Cloud knowledge, etc) I went for a £50k role with no hesitation, it will be challenging but in a good way.
 And I feel like I will be far more motivated knowing I am getting a salary worth my knowledge, skills and experience.
 I also have been offered contract work on the side, which I’ve always felt IT was hard to side hustle.
 But my PowerShell and modern workplace knowledge has been very desirable as of late. All that training paid off!
 So this post is just to say… go for it, as long as you are willing and train when required, maybe that role your eyeing up will work for you.
 Wish me luck!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Apologize in advance for my poor english skills, it is not my first language. However, I hope you could help with my issue:
 I have to update the company's DC so I did set up a a new DC with Win2022 as secondary DC, joined to the AD forest, and make sure the replication of AD Sites and Services, DNS, and GPOs were fine. The old one is a Win2012, I kept both running for a while, until I had some free time to decommission the old one.
 Finally, today I did transfer all the FSMO roles to the secondary DC make it as primary, the old DC is hosting the DNS server as well, so I added the new DC to each Forward Lookup Zone FQDN and changed the DNS in the network settings pointing our AWS Route53 (which I don't manage). At first, until the old DC was online and after I transferred the FSMO roles, all the clients and workspaces were able to resolve the new DC as DNS server, the group policies update correctly, everything looks fine. 
 Unfortunately, after I shut down the old DC, the new DC could not resolve out domain and lost the all the metadata it replicated before. Starting back the old DC resolved the issue, and everything went back to normal.
 Now I don't know what exactly where the issue is, I suspect this is something to do with the DNS but I really don't know what I missed.
 Thank you for your help!
