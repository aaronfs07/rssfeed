        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early last week PC across our org starting having one of three types of error:
 1 - PC would BSOD, possibly multiple times with no obvious cause and disparate error codes
 2 - Every application would crash in turn with an error indicating issues with Trend Micro's dlls
 3 - PC would boot to a black screen, but be online (even on wifi) and respond to remote commands (though any form of remote control would still yield a black screen)
 Eventually issues 1 and 2 would evolve into 3 in many, though not all cases. An upgrade of TM's client was complete or in progress at the time of the first presentation, which coupled with issue 2 made us conclude a botched update was the cause.
 Unfortunately repair didn't seem to work and TM's support suggested we proceed with a hard uninstall using their CUT program. The problem was this took an extremely long time (over a day in one notable case). We dug through the logs and discovered CUT was attempting dozens of tries with long timeouts for each operation, before eventually failing and moving to a more aggressive option (ie removing a service after failing to stop it).
 We discovered that an ini file was created upon launching the CUT executable and we could, if we were quick enough, replace that ini file with a modded one that reduced timeouts and # of attempts to something more manageable. This brought down removal time from hours to about 20 minutes per machine, which could be run in parallel.
 On some machines CUT would complete on first try, others would require a second application even though CUT logged its successful completion.
 After that we could reinstall the TM client with no further issue.
 TM support told us this has never happened before (when does it ever) and we're the only ones reporting it (what good luck), so I thought it'd be useful to put it here for anyone that should happen to suffer this issue or something similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone had any success reinstalling/resetting Windows Defender in Windows 10?
 We use crowdstrike as our main AV but would like to start using scheduled scanning on our devices per recommendations from our SoC.
 Our devices are in Intune, and I’ve found out that Defender will automatically run in “passive Mode” if we onboard our devices to Defender for Endpoint.
 This works fine on our newer deployed devices (via autopilot), but it won’t work on our previous ones that were “imaged” using MDT. I have a feeling that the previous image broke defender somehow since it included crowdstrike on the install, rather than installing after enrolling via autopilot in the new deployment.
 I’ve tried the commands I’ve found online to reset the app using AppX, re-registering it again using add-appx using the built in windows 10 manifest.xml, and resetting the app via “Windows Settings”. I’ve also tried restarting the Windows Defender service, modifying registry entries to enable “passive mode”, and simply enabling periodic scanning on the device itself. Windows defender seem to just won’t start at all. I checked group policy and Defender is not blocked.
 Any other ideas you guys may have to get defender running again? I could try uninstalling crowdstrike, but thats not really feasible if it’s the only way to deploy it on our older devices.

 I'm not talking about learning an app (for example Chef and building cookbooks) or generic stuff like automation (for example learning Python for scripting). I'm thinking like where will AI be or quantum computing and what kinds of roles there will be for the admins.
 Big industry-changing stuff like when Windows 95 came on the scene and the world hustled to move to distributed systems hiring anyone who could spell PC. Or when Amazon released commercial cloud computing and suddenly the "cloud engineer" title was the fat paycheck.
 Or maybe I just say screw it to cutting-edge tech and get a job supporting the Mainframe and COBOL? That stuff will be around long after I'm retired. Plus from what I see folks to support that is in very high demand.

 ​
 Im a entry-Level Sys-Admin and doing a Server upgrade at my workplace right now.
 We are switching from a Terra 7220 G1 to a 7220 G4, and are using VMware for Virtualisation.
 The G1 runs ESXI 5.5, which I plan to Upgrade to 6.5/6.7 before migrating the VMs to the G4 Server, which is expected to run ESXI 7.X on it.
 ​
 Therefore i need to know wheter my Hardware is compatibel with ESXI 6.5
 I already went to Vmware Hardware compatibility Guide to check it, but the list ends with a Terra G2 modell. 
 ​
 Does anyone know how to find out if my G1 is compatibel?
 Its equiped with 2x Intel Xeon E5-2600-v2 Series, which are supported by ESXI 6.5/6.7.
 Or do you think I should just try to upgrade?

Exchange picks up on it and blocks the legitimate email from sending emails since it is flagging it as spam. This disables and user and the only way to get around it is to create a rule in Exchange with a "body contains" rule. We use MWB Nebula to locate vulnerabilities and I do not see one on our Exchange server. I am a Jr. System Admin so Cybersecurity is something I am learning. I believe this would obviously be a Blue Team issue. We do have a vendor we work with for issues like this, but would like anyone's input if possible. Any more info just ask.

 We have a bunch of WMware VM's with BIOS firmware but goal is to get them to UEFI. We found that we can convert the disk using MBR2GPT.exe, but it brings an unexpected issue, the EFI partition is created at the end of the disk and the main partition is not extendable after that :(
 Also i could put MBR2GPT.exe to a MECM task sequence which boots into WinPE, converts the disk and shuts down, which is convenient.
 Has anyone faced a similar issue? How did you solve it? How to automate this as much as possible so that EFI partition is first on the disk?

 Disabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install aren't detected and the user isn't prompted for administrative credentials.

 Microsoft says to set it to whatever fits my environment, CIS Benchmark says to enable it. But: Auditor actually recommends disabling it.

 So heres the scenario: Our client has Active Directory, and we implemented Folder Redirection via GPO for all users (even AppData) and now it creates so many problems that i have no idea what to do. 
 For example: User is logged out from apps whenever he logs on other computer. He logs with his domain user on one PC then logs off and then logs on the other computer. When he logs off and comes back to his main pc and logs onto it, he is logged out in every app he was logged in. Google Chrome doesn't work properly, sometimes it doesn't even want to open.
 Do I remove AppData from Folder Redirection? Are there any other solutions that allow to load Users Profile on different computers? Maybe Folder Redirection should be completely removed?
 If i missed something that you need to help me, tell me in the comments, English isn't my first language so sorry about that.

Forest Trust;
 Two-Way;
 Forest-wide Authentication; 
 DNS have each other zones as secondary
 Both domains at forest function level 2008. 
 Domain A has one master DC and when Global catalog redundant, both in windows 2016
 Domain B has one single DC on Windows 2008.
 
  
From Domain A to Domain B all is super. I can assign permissions to either network shares or remote desktop service access at will on both domains.
 Now from Domain B to Domain A, If a network share is within a Domain A machine, all is super again. I can assign permissions to both domain users.
 Now here comes trouble:
  
if the network share is on a Domain B device, i can list domain A just fine, but when i'm about to assign a permission i get the error that the domain controller can't be found (but wait a minute you just gave me the complete list of users a moment ago?!);
 If i need to assign remote desktop permission to a domain B machine, again i can list all the users on domain A just fine, but when i'm about to commit the assign to a domain A user, again the error that DC couldn't be reached.
  
I have recreated trust countless times, i have deleted and reassigned DNS zones both as secondaries and as Conditional Forwarders, to no avail any help?
 EDIT: "The Active Directory Domain Controllers required to find the selected objects in the following domains are not avaiable: Domain A. Ensure the Active Directory Domain Controllers are avaiable, and try to select the objects again" 
 Hello?! Who gave the list that i picked a specific user in the previous screen? c'mon man...

The machine was then turned on at the weekend and has updated to Windows 11 for the 3rd time.
 Their server is 2012R2 so we're trying to keep the machines on Windows 10 until the new one is installed, does anyone have other methods of blocking the updates?

 I've seen this problem for quite some time and always ignored but I guess it's time to figure out how to fix it. So I'm looking for any advice on how to proceed with fixing it once and for all.
 Here's what I've looked into:
  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Preload has correct number of keyboard layouts - the two I've set (00000409 and 00000419, English and russian) - as expected
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Keyboard Layout\Preload has English only (00000409) - as expected
 
In settings > time and language > language I only have two languages selected, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
powershell's Get-WinUserLanguageList returns two languages, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
 And yet, there are three keyboard layouts to select from in tray - being two I've selected and 1 extra called QAA, which is basically English.
 Logging out and back in again doesn't fix it. Rebooting doesn't fix it. The only way to fix it is to override current settings - either using powershell or manually resetting up all that. But problem appears again sooner or later - maybe next reboot or maybe 4 months in - appears to be random.
 Googling leads nowhere as all there either temporal fixes that I've mentioned or common useless advice like "run sfc scannow"
 Has anyone figured out how to get rid of that problem permanently?

 Is there a way to remotely force a physical drive into down state on a Dell SCv3020 array?
 One disk in the array has very high (>300ms) latency and filling the log with "[Aborted]" messages but for whatever reason the array controller hasn't taken the disk out of the RAID. The high latency on one disk is breaking everything connected to the array.
 I can only find "Release Disk" in Storage Manager but that is trying to rebalance the RAID by moving the data away from the failing disk which will take a very long time.
 I'd like to force the disk into failed state without rebalancing. I know I could pull the disk, but I'm trying to avoid a long car journey.

We can bring in unmanaged devices on their network and our software works fine but it's only when we try and connect using their managed devices do we get blocked. 
 We've disabled their Sophos AV, apparently they've had a look at their inbound/outbound ports on Windows Defender and can't see any blocks on 7100 so my question is - how else can we find out what's blocking this port? Any scanning tools that will point us to some kind of GPO or other application block?

 I'm unable to setup the Process Explorer to run at startup via Task Scheduler. Regardless if I create the task via the Process Explorer menu 'Run at startup' or manually I am unable to make it work.
 I've installed Systeinternals via winget: ````
  
winget list sysinternals
 Name Id Version Source
 Sysinternals Suite 9P7KNL5RWT25 2022.10.1.0 msstore ````
  
Running the task does nothing and there are no errors in the task history log. It is as if nothing happens. 'Run with highest privileges' also does nothing What I find very odd about the installation is that procexp.exe is a 0kb file in the Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps folder. It has no icon but I can run it normally by double-clicking on it. However if I use Task Scheduler and I try to selected it (via Browser on Actions) I get the following error:  procexp.exe The file cannot be accessed by the system. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

 We deploy our image via ConfMgr. Enterprise version is selected from the iso as a untouched image. All our changes are done via GPO or CM after the iso. Originally it did not have a key defined (overlooked/assumed AD KMS would take over), but thats now been corrected in the Task Sequence.
 I stumbled on the fact my laptop is one thats affected; it's using the Pro retail key thats burnt into UEFI. ok - no problem; slmgr /upk, /ipk {GVLK}, /ato and /dli to confirm. /dli shows the expected KMS activation from AD. Great, job done i'll get that pushed out to existing clients via a Task Sequence that runs those same commands. A week later i noticed my laptop is back to the pro licence (i reboot weekly; sleep the laptop during the week)
 redo the slmgr process, reboot and now the key has reverted back to the pro retail key again.
 has anyone seen this behaviour or know why it's occuring?

 I am attempting to identify a specific planning tool that I have encountered in the past, but cannot for the life of me remember the name of. My Google foo seems to be pretty bad today as well.
 In summary, this is a tool published by a company (can’t remember the name) that allows you to pay an annual license fee to get access to part libraries from various vendors and then use these to build BOMs to submit to suppliers. I know it has libraries from Aruba, Cisco, Extreme, to name but a few. 
 Before anyone says it, I am not thinking about Visio or anything like that. This tool allows you to select e.g. an Aruba CX6300 switch and then can show you which addon modules are compatible with this switch and would then allow you build a complete BOM around this, including PSUs, SFP transceivers, interconnect cables, etc.
 Please, if anybody knows this tool, I am trying to identify it, as I need to submit budget approval for it.

 ​
 ​
 I have a scenario and couple questions 
 ​
 Here is the following configuration of the two organizations:
 ​
 Organization 1:
 ​
 Exchange 2013 CU23
 ​
 Organization 2:
 ​
 Exchange 2016 CU19 & Hybrid 
 ​
 Both organizations have an internal connection between them and a Full Trust Relationship.
 ​
 ​
 I am very confused related to the Organization Relationships.
 ​
 I have found an article like below.
 ​
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/the-hybrid-mesh/ba-p/605910
 ​
 MS says:
 ​
  
Create an Organization Relationship between Contoso on-premises and Tailspin on-premises. Use a unique SMTP namespace for the domain name in the Organization Relationship like OnPrem.Tailspintoys.com
  
Note: In most environments, the shared namespace “TailspinToys.com” can be used as the Target address for on-premises users and you would not need the additional namespace of onprem.TailspinToys.com. However, to account for all complex partnerships that could be in place, a unique namespace used as the target address will ensure free busy works properly.
 ​
 Note: The domain name “TailspinToys.com” is not present in any of the Organization Relationships in the Contoso environment. Keeping this name out of the Organization Relationship will ensure that you can continue to use the shared namespace and see free/busy information.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Do I have to use unique address like OnPrem.companyb.com? Because We dont have any DNS record such as OnPrem.companyb.com. I want to use companyb.com as domain name for Organization Relationship between Company A on-premises and Company B on-premises.

 We are designing a network for our new medical center within the region. When designing a hierarchical network, we were having brainstorming discussion with internal engineering team to take a decide on using 3-tier network for Data Center and 2-Tier for Campus (endpoints and end devices)
 The center would occupy 2000+ endpoints in the network. We propose two main core switches, setup as VSS and aggregating approx. 70 access switches installed in different floors in the building communication rooms. Single stack contains 5 or 6 access switches with 10G uplinks to upstream core switches. Access are all L2, and we route between VLANs using SVIs on the core switches and some VLANs are firewalled for Guest and IoT devices.
 Pair of high specs firewalls connected to cores for perimeter (internet, wan & dmz) and internal segmentation (servers & end devices, depending on the use case and security controls requirements.
 Eventually, with regard to servers, we are thinking about having 3-tier network: access > distribution > main campus core
 Two distribution switches with Servers SVIs on them or Firewalls. 
 L2 links terminated on Cores with Point-to-Point transit VLAN. Servers connecting to TOR access switches. 
 Please share your thoughts and comments for 3-tier approach and feel free to add your invaluable inputs if anything is wrong in the design.

 How much risk is involved with running a 10+ core switch? Am I crazy to run this another 5 years before replacing it? Do you see switches fail after 10+ years frequently?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did img backup using macrium of windows 10 ssd 240gb (full) to my external 2tb hdd, how do I boot into a vm from my external hdd since the internal ssd is full? It wouldn't let me as the img backup and the initial boot (loading the macrium iso) of the vm can't both be from the external hdd apparently? Just want to test and see if the backup works/is stable. Thanks all.
 ​
 EDIT: More info. I set the vm file location to the external hdd and when I tried to enable the physical usb external hdd to connect to the vm to load the disk img backup, an error popped up basically saying I can't do those 2 things from an external drive?? It wouldn't let me boot and recover the backup since if I enabled the physical external hdd to the vm to access the img backup, it would disable the external hdd to the main pc which is what the vm is running from. 
 Is there a way for the external hdd to work in the vm and with the main pc at the same time?
 ​
 Have I just missed something obvious? I am confused lol. 
 ​
 I must've done something wrong. Most people can't just boot up their backup on the internal drive because who has enough space for that? (Essentially 2 copies of a whole computer on the same drive) Mine is only 240gb, how do guys with maxed 3tb drives test their backups? Nobody just assumes their giant backup works?

 We even tried to reimported the SSL certificate and it seems that the whole ssl certificate IIS store stemmed broken

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a university, and most staff that have IT issues seem to think they already know the answer, or just have general "hmm I still think IT is at fault" demeanour when you're giving an answer to their problem.
 I generally try to be really civil, but sometimes the answer to an issue is so glaringly obvious, and becomes a real waste of time have to go through all the rigmarole to prove that the problem is a user problem, not a system/network/IT problem, that I feel I need to be a bit more blunt and not worry too much about how I'm coming across.
 To give you an example, just recently I had person in senior management raise a ticket because an important document couldn't be found on SharePoint. The ticket was escalated to me, and after looking into it, it just looks like someone moved the doc into another folder (probably accidentally). The user was trying to access the file from a URL link, and when it didn't work (because the file was moved), they panicked and assumed IT had done something. When I told the user that the file was most likely moved, their response is still implying that IT had something to do with it, as no one in their team (over 10 people, all with edit access to the file) would have moved the file. I reiterated that it was probably an accident by someone in the team, and a fairly common and easily addressable mistake, but the user has now involved their manager, to make sure the problem doesn't happen again. It's now become a way bigger issue than it ever needed to be, all because someone just accidentally moved an important file, and the user just can't accept that this happened and it wasn't someone IT behind it.
 This is just a recent scenario. Issues like these seem to happen all the time, where frustrated users just don't believe what you're telling them and seem to just blame anything on either IT staff or systems that they don't understand, yet speak with authority on.
 Any advice?

 I'm designing an EVPN-BGP network. I have never gone into etails wrt BGP.I read Krattiger's book about EVPN-BGP a Nexus 9000's perspective and there he always mentions that two fashions of eBGP might be used:
  
one AS for the spines, one for all the leaves; here the ption of accepting prefixes from own's AS must be cnfigured, otherwise all the announcements will be discarded
 one AS for the spines and one AS for each VTEP; here I only see a bit of complexity in configuring each VTEP because I cannot apply the same settings.
  
eBGP was proposed because, I think, if a peer goes down, then all the family memebers announce by it will be witdrawn in the peer's BGP table.
 Then somebody proposed to use
 3) iBGP but with Route Reflectors, because when a VTEP goes down all the family members announced by it will be withdrawn by the BGP tables of of al lthe clients.
 What do you implement in your own EVPN-BGP design and why?Any preferences among the 3 options above?
 TIA, Pan

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The idea is simple: We need dynamic allocation of an incoming request via https, which will use a domain, e.g subdomain1.domain.org, which needs to be mapped to internal IP X.X.X.X and Port Y. Then, subdomain2.domain.org needs to go on a different port and IP. 
 Nothing special so far.
 ​
 Dynamic meaning on the fly, without having to edit a config file. These mapping need to be editable by another program.
 ​
 The subdomains can be created at will and need to be routed to the correct instance of our program (where each instance runs on a different port).
 There is nothing special needed, just a simple domain -> IP:PORT mapping like HAProxy can do.
 However, HAProxy has its Runtime API, which seems to not be able to hold up to this task.
 ​
 Do I need to create a custom forwarding solution, or are there existing ones which i could use?
 I personally think that HAProxy is really made for this, but it does not feature a way for dyamic creation. Since adding needs to be done ASAP, these edits cannot be done by hand and have to happen automatically.
 ​
 Has anyone here experience regarding automatic proxying? It seems like NGINX has some kind of feature like this, but then i'd had to pay a few thousands bucks for their NGINX plus model.
 ​
 Please let me know if more clarification is needed.

 I'd like to hear what laptop you have and how it differs from what your users have, or if you have multiple tiers.
 The market really is Dell, HP and Lenovo. I'm not really interested in HP.
 They say IT should have what the users have. We're a bit tricky since we have a ton of tech employees and engineers.
 A lot of people are running docker on their laptops but do not need absolutely absurd power but this just means the low end is out.

We recently merged with several other “local” businesses and are looking to build out a core network between the sites. Our CIO has already indicated his desire that the core will be a DWDM fiber ring but has left the rest to me (with assistance from some of our consultants).
 I’m curious if anyone has any insights that they learned from doing something similar. Anything you wished you incorporated into the design? Any vendor preferences or experience? We are currently looking at Ciena and Adva for DWDM and Cisco and Extreme for Core Routing. And I’d like to have the same vendor supply both core routing and Data Center switches. Corporate Network itself will be Cisco for the foreseeable future.
 Size wise (for context) Site is Core Chassis, 24 IDFs (30 9400 chassis) and ~400 Access Switches. ~65-70000 endpoints according to ISE. The other three sites are about 1/3-1/2 that size

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am responsible for a community building in my village where we want to improve the network. The budget is limited of course.
 I want to have an internal LAN, for internal equipment, which can also be accessible through WiFi. I also want to create a public LAN for guests, wireless as well as wired (from selected places). The private lan should not be reachable from the public lan, but the opposite is ok.
 We managed to lay our hands on a Cisco WLC plus 5 APs as well as two Cisco manageable switches, so I believe that the only thing missing here is a router (preferably Cisco). Can anyone please suggest a suitable model? It needs to be able to handle Gigabit Ethernet, otherwise I don’t believe it needs any fancy features 
 I have found a used Cisco ISR 4331 for about $250 which is within my budget. Would this be a good choice?
 Thanks.

 My question is: is it better try try to supernet and add large ranges of IP, and maybe misalign some ranges, or to add all of the smaller ranges and ensure we have the right sites associated with each subnet?
 There is a business case for the smaller subnets, but I'm not sure if it creates issues with lag on site lookup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the fourth job in 7 years I'm getting laid off due to mergers or outsourcing and it's getting tiring. I'm in my mid-30s, right here when age discrimination starts becoming a real thing, and just want a stable company for the next 15 years. 
 So the good news is the company is giving us 10 months severance plus 1 week's pay for every year and 6 months of insurance after we are let go.
 The bad news. When our director called us into the conference call to give the news he was very candid and probably told us more than he should have. Basically, it boils down to money, the business leaders found they can hire in Europe/UK for 60% of US wages. They can hire Indians for 20% of US wages. Australian wages were a wash with the US. They also decided it's cheaper to move the HQ to Ireland (with much lower corporate taxes) and import to the US. 
 I work with folks from Ireland and UK every day and their work is every bit as good as what we do in the states. I'm not bashing their skills but more concerned if we, Americans with insane salaries, have priced ourselves out of the global market. The state I live in has an average income of $61k. I make $153k. I make this kind of money with no degrees, a couple of entry-level certs, and to be honest very little effort on my part. I just kind of have been the guy people get along with and every few years some past co-worker DMs me if I'm interested in a new job. 
 Add in the sharp rise in remote work capabilities it's easier than ever for companies to look abroad for workers. Hell, even Canada and Mexico have much cheaper labor.

 So I have 15 Surface Go with Windows 10 with S mode. I need to make all of them have Windows 10 Home(via the free switch using Microsoft Store) with the same set of software. I figured the easiest way to do this is to clone a "master" Surface Go and clone them to the other 14 machines using Clonezilla.
 I am wondering if the master Surface Go's license key will get cloned to the other machines or if their key is already burnt into bios and I don't have to worry about them. Or do I have to find the keys for each machine and "re-key" them after cloning? 
 As of now, I don't have a budget to get VLs or Enterprise licensing but if that is the only way to do it properly I'll have to do some convincing to my bosses...

 I understand in place upgrade on DC is not recommended. Would it be ok to demote, in place upgrade, promote? (of course, health check, migrate FSMO etc).
 I guess the next best option is deploy new VM, demote the old server and change IP of new server, then promote. But i lose the name and for matters of convenience, i'd rather not. Could i safely use the first option?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So its been about a year since I have been with this public community college. 
 One of the things they do here is when an employee retires they get to keep there email address. 
 I personally feel that that's not a good thing. I did some PowerShell here and there and basically did this. 
 1) Who are all the retired employees?
 2) When was the last time they have logged in to there exchange 2016 or Online. 
 Nearly all have not logged in within a year or more. 
 ​
 My concerns are that;
 1) They don't have MFA enabled. 
 2) They may contain sensitive information in those emails. So if the email becomes compromised that becomes accessible information. 
 3) If the account becomes compromised, they can use that email to communicate to other employees and make it easier to social engineer them. 
 4) A wasted license. 
 I am still new to my role and I may be paranoid for nothing, so from a more experienced individual what are your thoughts on this and if its best to get rid of this plan what are the reasons? 
 I have some directors that agree with me, but my VP of technology doesn't (Ironic I think). 
 ​
 But of course if a user isn't trying to log into there account would it really get compromised? I don't know, but I appreciate every input! Thanks.

 Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I'm trying to recreate it from scratch and I'm having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I've managed to set the 'admin' password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using 'cn=admin,cn=config', but that's about it. I can't change, create, or delete anything.
 I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don't remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can't even do that as the admin user itself is RO.
 What's even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I've been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can't write anything except its own password apparently.
 How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? 
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently onboarded a group of test engineers that are constantly running automated tests 24/7 (all conducted on their own VLAN network). Ever since they’ve joined everyone has started complaining about slow internet and we cannot upgrade our main ISP connection since we’re already on the highest (albeit slow in general) service tier. 
 Luckily a new ISP became available and we are about to sign up with them. 
 So I had a question about how to best configure my firewall appliance now that I’ll have two ISPs. 
 What are the pros/cons of these ideas:
  
Load balance WAN1 and WAN2. 
 
Get the testers on a dedicated switch that would connect to a dedicated interface port on the firewall and route that traffic to WAN2. 
 
 Which of these two would be the better option? If there are any better ideas let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. Just looking for some advice. I work in a public hospital system with 8500+ employees. Myself and one other person are responsible for Mobile Technology in all forms: Vocera, Encrypted Flash drives/Ironkey, iPads/iPhones and MDM (Intune), the corporate cellular account, and BYOD support. 
 We've basically been slammed since COVID happened. We work 50 hours a week, then get paged off hours because we didn't get to that one ticket that is now suddenly "patient impacting". Despite working without a lunch break, being in many meetings for projects (6-10hrs a week), and working my ticket queue when possible, we never catch up. For the past two years, we've never been under 100 requests, and we've been building two new sites that have many different mobile applications in which I'll somehow be supporting. As of current, my team of two support over 17k devices including 5k personal devices in BYOD. 
 I know nowhere is perfect, but I feel my boss is being arrogant when I ask him about hiring more people. His response is always "this is only a phase" or "we're fully staffed at what we have, we'll have to get caught up". But other internal IT depts are hiring like crazy. The apps team hired 5 in the last two years and the epic team brought in a whole company of 20 contractors to do their breakfix while they worked on our new sites. Just as examples
 I guess what I'm asking is is this situation everywhere? Am I dreaming that IT life doesn't have to be so understaffed and overworked? I'm salary and don't break 75k, and my coworker is at 55k. We get great healthcare, which is why I stay, but just wondering if you all think I should man up and realize I work in a stressful environment and IT is that way everywhere, or is there better out there somewhere? What's it like for you all in similar roles? Thanks for your thoughts!

 I’ve heard nothing from MS. I also suspect there is nothing sensitive I’ve given MS.
 I’m curious if anyone has been informed by MS that they were affected. 
 MS’ statement says, in part, “ Our investigation found no indication customer accounts or systems were compromised. We have directly notified the affected customers.”
 I’m also curious how they define “affected customers.”

 I am hoping that the collective minds here on Reddit can help me out. 
 I am the administrator of an air gapped network inside of our Enterprise-Wide Network 
 In order to access it the users must be on the EWN. 
 The network has its own domain which does not trust the EWN. 
 There is no smtp traffic allowed out. 
 The only way the end users can get it is to have an account on in my domain, as well as on the Enterprise domain. They can access 1 server over RDP.
 Now my problem is this, the accounts are set to expire every 30 days for security purposes. BUT there is no way the user can log in via RDP if their account is expired, to reset the account. 
 I am looking for a method for the users can manage their own accounts, so they don’t have to call me to reset their passwords. Are any of you in the same situation, and how do you resolve it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow IT professionals. I need your help and advise regarding PSU configuration issues in a Dell Poweredge r6515. It is running RHEL 8. I hope I can explain this clearly…
 We recently upgraded PSU’s in the server from 550w to 700w. According to the Dell website, the new PSU you install will take on the firmware of the previously installed PSU. So, in this case our 700w PSU is using the firmware of the 550w PSU. Obviously we just need to install the firmware for the 700w PSU’s. Here’s the catch, Dell doesn’t have any firmware for 700w PSU’s for this server available to download. There should be firmware available for download because you can buy the r6515 server from Dell with the 700w PSU’s installed. 
 When we boot up the server it enters the bios and gives a low power warning. 
 IDRAC says the input wattage is 666 and output wattage - rated: 700, actual: 550. 
 We have been talking back and forth with Dell tech support and their tier 1 support has no clue what’s going on. They sent technicians out this week to install a new power board but that didn’t do anything to help. The technicians got one of the Dell tier 2 support guys in the phone but he didn’t help much either. 
 Anyone have any ideas or have any experience with this situation?

I am the one on my team tasked with automating. However, automation isn’t my primary job. I have an associates degree and some Cisco certs (including DEVNETASC). I’ve created web apps, automated network configuration, and created scheduled scripts to automate repeatable tasks. I have seen job postings for “Network Development Engineer” roles at large companies like Amazon and was wondering if anyone here is in a similar role and can give me advice on what hiring managers are looking for. Do I need a computer science degree? I actually just started a journey to get a CS degree, but man is it time consuming(especially with a family), expensive, and a lot of math (four more math classes). Or would my time be better spent getting DEVNET Professional and maybe some cloud certs?

 Basically, something like a jason file that creates a desired server according to my specification quickly, without manually installing pieces, copy pasting configs, setting up user accounts, etc. I then simply keep track of this config file. 
 What software does that? Should I learn ansible?

 Majority of Apps team and senior mgmt is very new too and clueless and just trying to outsource to solve the issues
 lots of politics /pushback between teams ( especially apps/infra/security )and finger pointing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the question I have relates to Cisco Jabber. The User (or Users) can make calls from Jabber going from Jabber on his laptop to External company numbers. However they are not able to contact Internal company numbers.
 Naturally someone said it sounds like a routing issue. (Most of the company has Jabber working this is a new group being stood up working from vpns)
 User(who is on a vpn) can ping all the way into the Datacenter to the call manager server, I can ping from the switch the server is connected to, to the User PC. I can ping both directions from the Data Center Backbone switch. Routing seems to work. 
 ​
 So here's my thoughts. If they are able to talk to external numbers then the traffic has to go all the way into the datacenter anyways and hit the server before going back out again. Also from what I saw in emails of previous troubleshooting the Jabber Client on the PC is saying connected as far as registering with the server goes.
 (also for your knowledge I'm mainly from networking side of the house, we have a separate dept for the phone stuff so typically don't get too much into phone issues most of the time.)
 ​
 Jabber Outgoing - > External Number - Works
 Jabber Incoming<- External Number - Works
 Jabber Outgoing -> Internal Number - Not Work
 Jabber Incoming -> Internal Number - Not Work
 ​
 Any thoughts of what more to look into or questions I should ask?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently acquired a decommissioned Poweredge T420 that appears to be in okay condition, other than a missing RAID controller. 
 However, I'm also having issues at boot with iDRAC. Very similar to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cw7esz/idrac_initialization_error_on_poweredge_t420/ where fans are blowing at max speeds, the light at the back of the machine is flashing orange with the following error message:
  
Warning! iDRAC initialization error. Continuing to boot may yield unexpected power loss due to unknown power inventory and various features lost such as Remote Access, Active Power Management, Thermal Management, Inventory, LCD, or System Error Reporting. 
  
I guess my question is, do I have two separate issues going on here? Or is the iDRAC issue related to the missing raid controller. Just wondering if I purchase a replacement RAID controller am I going to still be stuck with more problems. This is my first Dell Server and have no experience with how iDRAC works.

 The thing is that the students are using O365 for their email and authentication but it does not appear that they have an Azure DC service. Faculty is using a hybrid prem/azure deployment with Clear pass access rules to provide services to the Faculty wireless network. 
 I am familiar with opening services up on a Meraki Wireless and clearpass is a new animal for me. If someone can point me to a doc or tutorial on opening up a domain/server to these guys i would appreciate it. My googlefu is weak.

 I looked in the OCG ENCOR book and it doesn't mention anything about how NAT would work in an environment like this. I imagine there's some way that 2 routers could share NAT translations but my Google skills are failing me.

It's running as a DC, a file server, and there's an Access database that clients access through some program installed on the workstations. There're two client workstations that can't have the program installed and so have to access the database directly on the server. Their previous IT set up RDS but never installed licenses; they just kept renewing the trial. We've had to fix a lot of how the previous IT did things and we are trying to get licensing for the two workstations that need to RDP into the server to access the database. I believe you can have the RDS session host and the RDS licensing manager on the same box, but correct me if I'm wrong. Can I use 2022 Server CALs for this situation or do I have to use Server 2016 CALs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I'm looking for recommendations of and experiences with Linux antivirus options for on-premise company servers. We already use Symantec on our Windows servers and clients, and while it has a Linux version, it lags behind in supporting recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) and it doesn't play nice with containers. We have a bunch of Ubuntu servers at various locations running QEMU/KVM virtualization, Docker (in VM), Kubernetes (nodes in VMs) und LXD containers (on bare metal) backed by local ZFS storage.
 We're looking for an option that is capable of dealing with containers, so that we'd only need to install the AV on hosts and VMs, and that offers sensible licensing/pricing, ideally per physical server instead of full price per install or at least reduced price for a VM install. Centralized management would be nice but not a requirement, log and/or mail based alerts would suffice. Needless to say we require good detection rates, timely signature updates and the capability to prevent the execution of malware. The main threat scenarios are malware getting on the servers either via compromised clients, exposed vulnerable services (hello Atlassian) or supply chain compromise (hello npm).
 The state of AV websites is a sad affair, with a general lack of clear statements about capabilities and business licensing options and costs (its all "Contact us!"), thus I turn to you.

 Left Switch: Vlan 10 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 10 computer
 (Connecting both Switches I have a trunk port configured in both Switches) 
 Right Switch: Vlan 30 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Router configured with subinterfaces for each Vlan (10,20,30), when "show ip route" shows everything allright
 So my problem is that I have configured everything exactly the same for each Vlan to make Router-On-A-Stick possible and it works, for example I can ping Vlan 30 computer to Vlan 20 computer or the opposite case but no computer on any Vlan can ping Vlan 10 and Vlan 10 can't ping the other Vlans. So what could be the problem? I swear to God I configured every Vlan in the same way and I have deleted the lab and started again several times and happens the same issue. Thanks in advance

I understand perhaps there's something different with the formatting of different data such as files or videos but on a digital level they're just a bunch of ones and zeros so why bother making different types?
 ​
 Also, I've tried cutting an ethernet cable in half and I can't seem to find any additional circuitry. All I saw was just a bunch of wires together. So what makes this ethernet cable different from a USB cable? Is there a circuit inside that I didn't see that processes or sends data differently?
 ​
 Also read that HDMI is better designed for sending media such as video, but why so? why is it better than a USB? Does it have some additional circuitry? If yes, what does it do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently anxious about a counteroffer I made today. So the job offered me $25 an hr which is $52K. I had the interview this past Monday-nailed my interview including the interview with the V.P. However, I made it clear that I had other interviews that week and could not formally respond until Friday. Another job offered me $28 or $56,160 a year. I called back Job A, recruiter was kind and asked me how my other interviews went. I said great and thanked him for being patient, I said another job offered $28 and wanted to see if they could match it. I stressed that I really wanted to work with them. He asked if I’d take anything lower so I said $27. This is about a $4K difference than their original offer. Normally I wouldn’t negotiate but I feel I’m the perfect person for the role-they actually sought me out from a job site-hounded me for about two weeks for an interview. They ended up offering me the role hours after my interview. My question is, did I screw up? If they reject my counteroffer, can I go back to their original offer? I didn’t make the counteroffer as a non-negotiable, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. He said the latest I should be hearing back is early next week. I wouldn’t start this job until Nov 7, after my two weeks notice with my current company so the delayed acceptance is not an issue.

 I have no idea what to do with so much RAM. Like, I was running a bunch of VMs and all kinds of craziness and I was hitting 10% utilization at its peak. 
 There must be something cool I can run on this server that would need this much. Any ideas?

 I work for a health org, so we have about 1200 or so Windows Servers (99% virtualized, on-prem). We monitor just about everything through vROPs when it comes to CPU/RAM/Disk/IOPS etc; but most important of all, Windows Services. All related tickets go to our 24/7 NOC
 We are currently on a vROPs version that is... well past N-1, so we were directed to switch. We chose vROPs cloud.
 When I first heard of the riddance of End Point Operations Management Agent (EPOPS) with vROPs cloud, I felt relief. That agent was truly a POS for some reason in our environment and a pain to deal with if it broke... Anyways...

 Network: Comcast static IP on business cable modem not resolving MX record for verizon.net
 I am trying to resolve an MX record for verizon.net and it's failing with no records found.
 C:\Windows\system32>nslookup
 Default Server: HAL.xxx.local
 Address: x.x.x.x
 > set type=mx
 > verizon.net
 Server: HAL.xxx.local
 Address: x.x.x.x
 *** No mail exchange (MX) records available for verizon.net
 I have determined that this is happening on multiple cable based business comcast networks all with static IPs.
 If anyone can check and report back also? If so, no idea how or to whom to report this?It's fine on a Verizon static FIOS network and on a Comcast fiber network, and on a home Comcast cable network just not on a static cable based business Comcast network...
 And i also tried changing DNS servers within nslookup with the same result... so something is blocking MX resolution for verizon.net but just on Comcast business cable connections!?!
 If anyone else is experiencing this as a workaround i setup a send connector scoped for that one domain using smarthost:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We use Symantec Email.Security Cloud. Yes, I know, Broadcom stuff. Don't ask about it.
 This week, Microsoft 365 just disabled Basic Auth from our tenant.
 So, if you are using Schemus (their sync tool) and syncing from Exchange Online (EXO), app passwords won't work anymore. 
 Worked with Broadcom's support. Surprinsingly, so far so good. 
 Support adviced to:
 - upgrade Schemus to latest downloadable version ( Schemus Synchronization Tool – Mandatory Upgrade (broadcom.com) ) and apply a support-supplied patch. This will enable Microsoft Graph as a source and enables usage of Exchange Online Cert-based auth.
 - Install Powershell 7.03+ plus EXO v3. If using Server 2012 R2 (like me...don't ask again) you need to create a config file so Schemus knows where to look for PoSh 7.
 - Configure an App Registration in Azure AD to allow to authenticate against EXO with a certificate (CBA, App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell | Microsoft Learn )
 - Reconfigure Schemus to use EXO CBA. 
 - And that's it...supposedly.
 Why supposedly? Well, seems like Schemus still uses EXO v1 "get-recipient" and that causes a timeout for us for just the "user" sync part (which is optional, but we use it). I managed to reproduce that error and compared against "get-EXOrecipient", which worked fine. Already told them that, so I guess we will have to wait for another patch from Broadcom's developer, Metanate (the one who develops Schemus).
 Hopefully this will help others who are stuck with Broadcom's stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some suggestions on what hardware to purchase for a firewall and switch. We are a small company and the budget is limited. We would prefer (though this is not essential) a single box and something that does not require subscriptions. One of the key requirements is that the stack has no single point of failure as we need to meet high uptime guarantees and so I am looking for something with a redundant power supply (I suppose 2 cheaper switches might be ok). We also need to be able to access the device management interfaces (iDRAC, IPMI) of devices on the internal network remotely and so need to have some facility to create a VPN (this seems preferable to a jump host). So, the requirements are: 1) Redundant power supply 2) Firewall 3) VPN 4) 10GbE minimum (SPF+ is preferred to RJ45) 5) <10 ports required
 Our main issue is that everything available that has redundant PSUs has 40+ ports and costs $$$. We only really need a single WAN port and 5 LAN ports (make that 10 to allow for expansion). Techbuyer have a useful product filter here: https://www.techbuyer.com/uk/catalog/category/view/s/network-switch-selector/id/482/ but all the results are switches with 40+ ports. Does anyone know of other product databases one can use or have any personal suggestions (including a different design utilising multiple boxes)? Any help much appreciated.

Don't need to be outdoor rated per se, will be indoors, just not a climate controller indoors, so harsh temperature/humidity exposure.
  
L2 only is fine
 at least 5 10/100/1000 PoE or PoE+ ports
 at least 2 SFP+ (might be able to compromise with SFP)
 AC powered preferred (no need for dual/redundant power)
  
Looking at the usual suspects, Mikrotik CSS610-8G-2S+IN looks like it might be a price winner, but only lists ambient temperatures and not operating temperatures? None of the Mikrotik outdoor-rated switches seem to check all the boxes. Aruba's rugged CX 4100i seems perfect on paper, anyone have experience they can share with those?
 Would also be open to older generation, used/refurbished units if it means I don't have to wait for any huge supply chain backlogs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are working for multiple customers. Mostly we administrate some servers or databases for those (so we run Ansible, we connect to databases, replace certificates and such tasks). Every customer is sharing us a VPN – mostly personal accounts with 2FA, not a site-to-site or a general VPN account. This means that every new colleague is getting a new VPN account. Some VPNs require additional configurations (f.ex. setting routes/DNS manually), some not. And we have plenty of technologies: OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, FortiClient VPN, Cisco, …
 As some are using Linux, some Windows, some macOS – there are always troubles setting the VPN's up.
 We first started using OpenConnect, which supports a lot of different VPN services. But we had the problem that some configurations did not apply correctly and that some IDS systems detected this and it was forbidden by the IT.
 So: I'm looking for a way how my co-workers easily can connect to the different VPN's. I'm currently thinking of creating an RDS Server for each customer with everything preconfigured, authenticated by a certificate – or maybe something with Amazon WorkSpaces. But I think there must be a better solution to this.
 How do you handle this? Do you have an idea how we could gain some efficiency instead of a long on-boarding process and big documentations? It can be a technical solution, as we're mostly developers, system engineers or similar.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I oversee a few campus networks where each campus currently has 1 subnet/network for voice and data that spans multiple buildings.
 I'd like to create a VLAN (200) specifically for the phones but use a unique subnet per building. This will allow us to tell the phone system if network = 1.0.1.0/24 use e911 number 555-555-0001.
 Building A (with the firewall) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.1.0/24
 Building B (uplinks to Building A) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.2.0/24
 Building C (uplinks to either Building A or B) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.3.0/24 
 Currently all Buildings have a 'data' VLAN (1) using the subnet 1.0.0.0/24 
 IIRC, this can be done via VLAN Mapping or Translation? Not something i've every used. Unfortunately, our HPE OfficeConnect (1820/1920 mostly) switches don't seem to support this. (I hate these switches) 
 My first thought was to create a VLAN on the firewall per building with a DHCP scope/relay and somehow convert that VLAN to the same phone vlan on the switch. However, I realized this isn't easily doable - I could connect two untagged ports together to accomplish this but, ew. 
 My next thought would be to utilize the switches to handle VLAN 200 and set up a DHCP relay (our switches won't act as DHCP servers (nor do i think i want to manage that..) I believe all of our switches are Layer 3 lite - allowing for routing. This would work but i'd have to let the voice traffic traverse the data network and add in routes on the firewall to point to each network switch.. it sounds messy. 
 Is there a solution that I'm not seeing to accomplish this? (Besides buying new switches lol)

Yes, we do get additional compensation for the week of being on call, but my thinking is that setting these expectations is what results in mistakes being made and on the job injuries. I'm not saying that you shouldn't work the next day but expecting someone to be up and running first thing and being sleep deprived is not a healthy thing.
 Am I wrong for thinking about it this way? What are your thoughts on this or what expectations does your company set?

 was wondering if port aggregation coupled with load ballancing the two connections could make more use of the available WAN bandwidth?

 I have not found any resources or guides on how to audit "activity type = calls" with PowerShell.
 Currently, I can navigate to admin.teams.microsoft.com > Users > Manage user > $user > Meetings & calls and I can see call history there. But I can't find any resources on how to grab that with PowerShell and export it to a different data source. Ideally I would like to get it into a CSV and later visualize it with PowerBI.

 I am going to be doing some wireless surveys pretty soon, and was looking to see if anyone had suggestions on building an AP on a stick cart? I have an AP, I have one of those standard two shelf utility carts, UPS, and a small PoE switch for power conversion. What I don't know is how I can get the height that I need to lift a pole up and down? My ceilings are going to be 10ft for the most part, so I don't think building something with static height will work very well.
 ​
 Thanks!

 Some of our users access another company's application, they use their email address and password from our sync'd AD.
 The thing is, their accounts all have expired passwords, yet they are still validated and can use this application.
 Should Microsoft not recognize its an expired password and deny access?
 If they log in locally on our domain they are prompted to change their password and can't login until they do - but this cloud app simply authenticates them.
 Friends, what am I missing?

 Does the fact that I have the VF in the function now mean that I am bypassing the host os networking stack and could theoretically achieve line performance or is there more I need to do? 
 I've done lots of research but I'm still pretty confused how this actually works. My current understanding is the network driver mounted into the kernel does the magic that means the standard network stack is avoided allowing the performance improvements, is this right?

 We have several Rukus Zoneflex R310 access points in our network, which was originally set up by a third party. I need to change the IP address for our access points which are currently on a 172.16 range. They need to be changed to a 192.168 range. However, whenever I enter the correct IP address to access the browser login page for the AP, I get a 503 service unavailable error. The IP address is definately correct and I have tried accessing it both wirelessly and through a physical connection via our LAN switch. Either way I'm getting the same 503 error and therefore can't make the necessary changes. 
 Any ideas? 
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically all the people who get paid more than they should at this company and think they are very important, are suddenly demanding I find a way to turn off 2FA on all their sites and services. Those here before me started the process of turning it on everywhere, and got stopped and canned for attempting it, even after getting the okay and explaining/communicating the process company-wide. They also want to make it so screens don't lock automatically, and want to use a single shared account for all the public workstations (meeting rooms and such) instead of logging in with their own account or bringing a laptop for presentations.
 Basically C-Suite says: I want all the computers to be unlocked and working before I get near them
 But my experience says: 2FA everything, lock every screen after 10-20 minutes of no activity, detect and disconnect mouse jigglers if needed, and always use unique accounts even at public kiosks
 This company is constantly under attack from phishing/spoofing and can't afford to pay for better M365 tiers to mitigate it. One of the IT Directors used the password Passwerd2020 a couple years ago, and the pen tester was able to use that account to find and access a full AD backup (don't have more detail on this, but it was bad).
 Seems they should be freaking out about how bad their security is, instead the execs are just trying to poke more convenience holes. Is there a psychological trick or some kind of magic words that get this through? Can I just say it's synergetic and get them to turn around? I'm not great at dealing with people who don't accept the truth and want to see IT as an obstruction.
 It's like having people say "It's really inconvenient, remove the deadbolts on my doors. The handle has a lock, why do I need two?" over and over.

 My task I am trying to do now is to check is a specific ACL exists, and then to also verify it is placed on one of the vty lines. Normally, I would start by doing something like this....
 Output = net_connect.send_command ('show ip access-list') if "ACL NAME" in Output: print ('Compliant') else: print ('Not Compliant') 
 That works, but I also want to verify that it is place in the right location. So I could do another function like above to run a "show run | sec line vty" and verify that "ACL NAME" is in the Output. But that would be 2 different functions and 2 different print statements.
 Is there a way I can run both of those checks and have one print statement if they are both compliant?
 I was thinking I could do something like this....
 def check_acl(Output) if "ACL NAME" in Output: return True return False Output = net_connect.send_command ('show ip access-list') if check_acl(Output): print ('Compliant') else: print ('Not Compliant') 
 I was thinking I could do 2 def statements then have the function check for both def statements, but I am getting lost with that.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks

 Until I presented him with the laptop usage agreement. See, about a year ago, shortly after we added this client, we helped them draft Device Usage Agreements for users. 
 Pretty basic stuff. Date, Serial Number, condition issued, agreement for work purposes, cannot install/uninstall software, etc.
 Dude loses his absolute mind. Refuses to sign. Starts talking about how "No one is going to tell him what he can or can't do with his laptop!"

 I am trying to start a new project where I need some devices which will be configured with OSPF and stacking or MLAG. So far I had setups with Cisco 6500 (no stacking here but dual supervisors), 2x Brocade ICX 6610 in stacking, 2x Dell 6224 in stacking. What I can say is that cisco and brocade were both extremely stable while dell had CPU usage issues along side other minor issues. Obviously all options I used so far are very old and I would like to try something new which consume less power.
 I was looking at Arista DCS-7050TX or Dell S4048-ON (I know there is a risk of Clock Signal failure, or was there?). Any suggestions or maybe different options? And yes I am sure these options are a bit older too but for this personal project I would go with something refurbished. Thank you :)

 Just got a new role at a new place and noticed every switch here is a layer 3 switch performing some routing capabilities.
 Just curious about the industry and architecture. Is it typical to have access layer switches have ip routing enabled on it? (I saw some post that said there’s no need to turn it off)
 What are your thoughts!

 I want to make a rule that checks if an email is part of our exchange and if not than to reject the message. we are pretty small only about 80 email users spread between 3 buildings. we never get hit with spoofed email of real people in our company but we always get hit with spoofed emails of our domain with a fake person and our users get tricked into giving info because they think this is someone new at a different building.
 I know I can do this in exchange rules but I would always need to add a new user to the approved list\ Group every time a new person is hired. I want it to be automatic when a user is created.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[some time ago i decided to change jobs in a hope to get some motivation back (I was working night-shift in a medium sized enterprise). 
 i now got a job in a tech startup (30+ employees 70 R&D) I have never worked in a start up before and most of my experience has been from larger organizations or enterprises. 
 Before i joined the company all systems administration has been done by DevOps and the CISO, so most if not all systems have never been setup properly, lots of software or other systems are still running trial versions that in some cases are expired with limited functionality. every day is a new challenge to just maintain a proper production. 
 I am hired as the IT systems administrator, so everything with IT, user management, Governance, risk and compliance falls under my scope. 
 With this whole mess that i am trying to balance I am slowly starting to lose my mind, and my motivation is long gone. 
 How do you keep the motivation up?
 it has been so bad for me that i have even considered if i should start working in a completely different line of work (oh yeah, I applied for a job in the local Lidl because the benefits are better then what i get now) 
 I actually don't expect any replies, just needed to get this off my chest

 So we have had an Android developer inform us that they were trying to use Android Studio with emulated (enrolled) devices but when trying to use certain features that require "Verify Apps over USB" to be disabled they can't. When I looked at their device it shows that it is enabled and the config profile assigned is the same as the one on my test device.
 What is weird is that my device shows as disabled, we have the exact same config profile assigned and all I can see is that the developer options settings is allowed from the list of settings.
 Anyone know where this setting sits or is named under in android config profile settings.
 Thanks

 We can reproduce the issue regularly by going onto a network that doesn't have permission to the print serve, open word, and edit margins. Word then locks up while searching for the printer (which it can't find the default printer because they are not on the VPN or Network with permission to the printer). Eventually times out and seems to remember the time out for that session of word. It does cause other delays also
 Others are saying they get around it by setting a default printer to the local PDF writer but that isn't really the best option. 
 It seems office is trying to connect to get the page setup information from the printer. Is there a setting somewhere to change this behavior. We are kind of stumped at the moment.

It really got me thinking about all the abuse I've had to deal with over the past 20-odd years. Fellow employees yelling over the phone about tickets that aren't even in your queue. Long nights migrating servers or rewiring entire buildings, come in after zero sleep for "one tiny thing" and still get chewed out by the Executive's assistant about it. Ask someone to follow a process and make a ticket before grabbing me in a hallway and you'd think I killed their cat.
 Our pay scales are out of wack, every company is just looking to undercut IT salaries because we "make too much". So no one talks about it except on Glassdoor because we don't want to find out the guy who barely does anything makes 10x my salary.
 Our responsibilities are usually not clearly defined, training is on our own time, unpaid overtime is 'normal', and we have to take abuse from many sides. "Other duties as needed" doesn't mean I know how to fix the HVAC.
 Would a Worker's Union be beneficial to SysAdmins/DevOps/IT/IS? Why or why not?
 I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. I guess I kind of wanted to vent. Have an awesome Read-Only Friday everyone.

 I’m posting here because i’m a bit lost and I don’t know what to do with my career. I’m a network engineer currently working in the banking industry. Currently I work a lot on campus networking and especially Wifi (Cisco and Aruba) and NAC stuff (mostly ISE), but I’m one of the few in the team which is able to work on almost every perimeter (LAN, WIFI, Automation, Routing, Security).
 Right now I don’t really know what would be best for my career, I could dig more in WIFI for exemple and become a specialist in one of those field or keep being a « jack of all trade master of none ». But i’m always afraid by choosing to become a specialist on a field, WiFi, i’m closing myself some doors and be less futur proof in my career.
 So I’m interested from your experience what do you think would be best to do ?
 Thanks a lot

 If I replace it with a short cable it works fine, so it is definitely the cable.
 Not sure if it's a dodgy cable or if I am getting lots of electromagnetic interference.
 Should I buy a shielded cable? or perhaps a cat 7. or is there some way to make linux run on a more unstable connecton since windows seems fine with it.

But people still reported issues which I isolated to Google Calendar invites. So I set up DKIM for Gmail and go the DNS provider to add that TX record. 
 After enabling authentication, I'm finding the "Sending email" dialog in Thunderbird on my laptop sat there for ages before sending. Sending email from the GMail web UI didn't do this. Now, some ten minutes or so later, I tried again from Thunderbird and there was a flicker of a pause, but nothing like before. So I'm hoping the initial long delays were just because the DNS changes were propagating. Can I hope this is the case? Can anyone verify that just after enabling DKIM, a pause sending emails is expected and is due to DNS which will ease over the next 24-48 hours?

 I'm running the application as an administrator with my domain admin account, I can see a successful login for my Service Account in Azure when I get to the Azure AD sign in stage, but I get this error!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, of course it's DNS....
 I've got one server (Windows Server 2022 VM on Nutanix AHV) that's having problems doing DNS lookups. Not consistently, it can usually ping the DCs in its domain and in the forest root above it. But the lookups tend to be slow. And many other servers in the domain don't resolve.
 I've done a netsh winsock reset and a reboot, which I thought fixed it (I could resolve a hostname that wasn't previously working) but just seems to have made it a little better, not fixed it altogether. I've removed the virtual NIC and put a new one in. I've switched temporarily to DHCP. The issue persists. It's using the two domain controllers as DNS servers, the same as every other server in that domain, and they're all fine.
 "Test-Netconnection DC1 -p 53" connects successfully (as does DC2).
 If I do an nslookup for anything, it finds it. But if I immediately ping it, chances are, it won't resolve the name.
 Name resolution fails regardless of whether I just search for the NETBIOS name or the FQDN. I've tried putting a random dot at the end of both as per some ancient article I found on Google, but that doesn't work either.
 This server has just gone live to the whole business, so I really don't want to rebuild it if I can avoid it, but I'll try most non-destructive things out of hours. I've got good backups of it but I don't really know when this started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 I'm looking for ways to centrally manage access to customer, and internal servers. Servers are 95% accessed by RDP, if not, TeamViewer.
 Some customers we've got shared admin credentials to, others we've got personal credentials on, and we'll need to be able to use both - with personal ones only known to the individual user.
 Today we're using Royal TS and managing document (RDP/gateway/credential folder) access with Azure Security Groups -> AADDS Security Groups.
 We're a Windows house, fully onboard with Azure, with all that it entails.
 ​
 Need to have:
  
Centrally managed access controle. This can happen any which way, fx via Security Groups.
 
Logging. Access log is a must have.
 
Automated emergency access.
 
Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory Domain Services integration.
 
Windows and Mac support.
 
Helpful vendor support.
 
Session recording.
 
GDPR compliant. 
 
Admin and user rights.
 
 ​
 Nice to have:
  
PIM/PAM support.
 
Password management from the same vendor - for passwords not related to the servers.
 
PowerShell manageable if applicable (it's nice not to have to go through every single setup point, for hundreds of customers).
 
Auditing for GDPR (if applicable).
 
 ​
 If PAM is included, I'm looking for cheaper alternatives than Delinia/Thycotic and Cyberark. (Though if a good price can be provided, they're in the loop)

 But when i try to add the url in the "RemoteApp andf Remote Desktop Connections" under controlpanel it says "Incorrect username or password", this makes the auto deployment of the url impossible.
 Is there a setting i have forgotten to set or is this a lost cause?

 A really strange but replicable issue has arised.
 When a user forwards an email in the ios outlook app that contains pictures (such as a logo in the signature or inline images) ALL images in the email (including previous mails in the same email) become one of the images. 
 This only happens if you select "Expand previous mesasge" (rough translation, sorry) during the forward. You can see that all images gets turned inte one of the images in the "edit-mode" but that is not necessarily the same one that gets sent.
 We have the lates ios outlook and ios 16.03
 Have you seen anything like this?
 To try it yourself: 
  
Open an email with pictures 
 
Select Forward
 
Click "Expand Message" / "Show full message"
 
All the images gets turned into one of the pictures
 
 Optional:
  
Send the email
 
All the images could turn into one of the other images in the mail

 The equipment I have is below:

 UAP-AC-Pro: 9W x 3
 Poweredge R320: 350W x 2
 HP Microserver: 200W

 Preferably I'd like it under £1000 but could stretch to perhaps £1250-1500 if really required.

 Existing gear in IDF1 was a Cisco 2960x with 1gig link back to MDF (Meraki ms425).
 Upgraded IDF1 to Meraki ms225 and new 10gig MMF SFP last night. Had issues trying to get the fiber link up. Tried rolling fiber at IDF. Tried rolling fiber at MDF. Tried different patch cable at IDF side. Now what worked was rolling at BOTH sides. Once that link came up (and at 10gig), I was like - that doesn't make sense so we tested and rolled them both back and tried all other combinations, fail.
 Fast forward to tonight. Same site, different IDF, same MDF switch. Link wouldn't come up after new gear was in. I said let's roll both sides at the same time. Link came up. What the hell?
 The only thing I can think of is - at the MDF side, fiber patch cables are orange, but there's about a foot of distance leading starting at its LC connector where ONE of the strands turns yellow. Where it transitions orange, there's about 2 inches of some sort of shrink wrap and the cable gets slightly bulkier there. The other strand is orange the whole way. It looks factory made. I haven't been able to find an image of those online. 
 Who know what's going on here?

I am destined to be a network-guy (but it could change to something else if it fits, I am pretty open to other positions), which fits the focus of my previous position, but with a lot of focus to newer technologies like software defined networking / SD-WAN and the like which I have pretty much no clue about. (Well, I setup a vxlan peering on my proxmox-homelab-cluster and connected three VMs with it, but that's about it :-D)
 I guess I made a good impression and I was pretty honest about this lack of knowledge on my part, so there will probably be provided training at the start and I will not be expected to have this knowledge. I think I showed enough willingness to learn new stuff and general interest in IT to be a future asset to my employer.
 Be that as it may, tldr, I'd love to read up and learn about the newer network-concepts like SDN/SD-WAN and stuff in this direction but I am not sure where to start exactly. Can someone point me in the right direction? Or maybe recommend some good papers/videos about this stuff? I'd like not to focus on a specific manufacturer, but if they provide good content I don't mind.
 Thank you very, very much!

 Problem 8(using link): I know that the window size is how many frames it can transfer at a time. 
 In this scenario, the first 3 frames are sent, and B would have to send an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec and therefore, 30 msec after the frame transmission begins. 
 How I interpret it:
  
Frame 1 takes 10 msec to arrive from A to B
 I don't understand "The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec, and therefore, 30 msec" Are we still talking about frame 1? 
  
​
 This is the diagram i've written to help me understand it:
  
I have 10 frames(10 boxes)
 A sender with vert line, and B is receiver with vert line: frames 1,2,3 are sent.
 Frame 1 takes 10 msec to transmit from A to B
 Frame 2 takes 10 msec after frame A is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 Frame 3 takes 10 msec after frame B is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 3 frames fill up the window, so receiver has to send out an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. Window slides, and A is able to send another frame to B, then B sends acknowledgement again and it repeats. 
  
The bullet point I bolded is what I am struggling with. My teacher has tried explaining this to me, but I'm not grasping that way of interpreting it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I work for a MSP and we're thinking of trying to replace some Cisco VDSL modems with the Proscend VDSL2 SFP, just trying to wrap my head around the potential configurations that we might use for this.
 Our current plan is to stick the SFP into the switch for the clients (Most clients only have 1-2 switches, generally a Cisco of some sort, 24-48 ports with 2-4 SFP ports.) and then setting one single SFP and one single RJ45 port into their own VLAN and using that to bridge the SFP Modem with WAN interface on the router. However, for the router to connect to the ISP over this SFP modem, it requires tagging a VLAN on the WAN interface.
 If we were to set the SFP and RJ45 ports to access ports to some random VLAN - e.g. 2000, and then set the router to tag VLAN2 on the WAN port, would the switch see the VLAN2 tag on these access ports and then just strip the VLAN tag?
 One of our other options is just a SFP to RJ45 media converter, but then that requires extra plugs, and an extra point if failure, not to mention more cost rather than just plugging the SFP into a switch and partitioning the switch out, not as costly as a router but a cost that the client would need to bear.
 Alternatively, we could just upgrade all of our clients to routers with SFP ports, but then we're going to need to convince the clients to put the money in to upgrade their routers in the cases where they don't already have routers with SFP ports.
 Any opinions on the best way forward while still being cost efficient?
 Thanks all!

 We have a MS CA but we also have the ability to grab a third party cert. There are about 10 people that will need to be able to sign. We use yubikeys so we have the ability to leverage them. 
 Anyone else do this in a small dev team with no code being sent externally? To be honest I've never dabbled with code signing before and most info is for Dev firms and large companies needing a lot of people to do it..

Currently, it's a flat network 192.168.1.1 /24 with our 48 port switch on eth1 port of ubiquiti edgerouter 4. The switch has multiple desktops(~10) and printers connecting to some win servers (setup as a terminal server). The voip phones would be added at each station sitting in front of the respective desktop on the same line. In order to power the phones, a second poe switch will be added as well.
  
 1) Firstly, should I be plugging one switch into another daisy chain style so the phones can see the SBC controller I've setup on the win server? In doing so, all uplink data will be running through a single shared 1GB line which is not great but it's only 10 u…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I maintain a small coaxial cable TV plant for a campus with a few dormitory buildings (about 400 rooms total). It's really simple with the CATV headend (digital QAM modulator) and we pipe in our licensed channels to it in addition to a few in house channels for signage and information. We're making a new dormitory that will be all ethernet and no coax to the room to use simple digital CATV enabled TVs. 
 It appears the hospitality IPTV market is large from fancy ones that have splash pages that welcome you with customized information to your room. I do notice that at the hotels a lot of them have set top boxes behind the hospitality TV and this seems complex. I feel like buying hospitality grade smart TVs will lock us in or perhaps the set top box is the way to go? How much do these systems cost to maintain and license? is it even worth it?
 I really like the simplicity of coax CATV, just scan for new channels (the channel plan rarely changes) and go, so I can just push to get coax installed in the new dorm to each room and extend CATV to the dorm with HFC fiber. Change my mind?
 One possible driving factor for IPTV is to also allow users to watch IPTV on their desktop or mobile devices. I can technically hit the multicast IP on the distribution side (source to QAM modulator) and watch it in VLC but it's not too user friendly. I don't know how many users would actually watch our channels on mobile. I have tested Haivison's HMP product and have always wondered if there are competition products to this. Is there anything open source in this space at all?

It is giving esoteric errors that the MSP says DATTO says are due to a corrupted disk. The whole ordeal has been dragging out over weeks and I'm basically 
 "can i replace the disk?" no answer to that question.... 
 "can they check the disk" "ok we'll ask them....". Two days later I finally get a response that the disk is fine... but something is wrong with the (out of warranty) device. They want me to sign a new 3 year agreement and they'll give me a free box (I'm on the cusp of not wanting to work with this MSP anymore so a commitment is not high on my list!). But they also increase the rate by about 30% - which seems extravagant. I hate not being backed up and I'm pretty angry at myself for not getting VEAMM community up and running as part of my 2 onsite backup system. 
 I haven't had offsite replication in over two weeks. I'm unsure if my onsite/on-device backups are good or not. My SQL server backups are backing up to the attached NAS share without error, so... i guess those are ok... but they're not offsite. After weeks of no backup I'm ready to sign fucking anything, but such a strong increase sounds like a ball twist. 
 Is DATTO, now owned by kaseya (mind you, DATTO saved me from ransomware that a Kaseya server distributed so... fuck Kaseya and I'm extremely sad that they purchased DATTO), jacking up prices? Or is my MSP taking me for a ride? A $2000increase on top of an already expensive service is pretty fucking harsh, in my opinion.

 If I could use Ubiquiti I would choose USW-Pro-Aggregation.
 If I could use Cisco I would choose Nexus 3064.
 I'm looking for something around these. Was given a tip for Huawei but I'm not sure. I personally worked with Juniper and HP (before aruba lines) and I don't see a problem with either.
 Not really fond of MikroTik but I'm not even sure if they offer anything around what I'm looking for.
 Any other ideas? Switch can be used, it doesn't need to be brand new (so I allow older EoLed models).
 Would be great if anyone could post models that I can look for and which definitely not even consider.

 The VLAN these IPs belong to only exists on this switch and is not allowed on any trunks. I have also crosschecked the access ports assigned to the VLAN and confirmed that none of them have any of these IPs. While there is obviously reference to the network these IPs belong to in the config there are no direct references to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client who has a PtP setup with Unifi NanoBeam 5AC's between their home and an event area about 900 feet away, distanced is reported by the Unifi device. At the home I get about 700 Mbps on wired LAN with speed test at fast.com. When I plug my computer in to the end of the PtP link at the event area, I get about 190 Mbps down and 180 Mbps up after the speed test. Event area is at the other end of a farm area so as far as I know, no electrical/wireless interference in the path.
 The speeds are more than enough for what is needed at the event area but the client wants to expand internet to a barn that has line of sight with the event area, it is about 1400 feet away (distanced is reported by the Unifi device). The barn will then have a PtMP that aims to 3 homes. I would include an aerial view but I can't share images here.
 My concerns are as follows:
  
How can I increase bandwidth between home and event area so that the barn and 3 homes can also benefit from the Internet circuit? What stats do I need to review and settings to tweak to try to increase bandwidth to near theoretical max throughput?
 If the home reaches consistently 700 Mbps, what is the max I should expect after the first PtP hop?
  
Do you have any specific resources I can read or watch to have a better understanding on how to optimize the wireless links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we've been dealing with some issues regarding Spectrum speeds/reliability for awhile now. We're being charged $400 a month for the 50x50 line itself (In the city), along with additional costs for things like a managed firewall. We've had stability issues quite frequently in the past with this line, but the stability seems to be better now. 
 50mb/s is not meeting our needs though. I understand the high cost is to guarantee these minimum speeds, though our speeds don't seem to really ever go above that. A shared line could give us 20 times the speeds for a quarter of the price. I would think that the 50mb/s is a minimum amount of bandwidth we'd get, shouldn't we still be able to get higher speeds despite them not being guaranteed? Or are we being capped at that 50mb mark? It seems like that 50mb/s minimum is our maximum, which seems a bit absurd. I'm not really sure if we're being throttled at that bandwidth. 
 If spectrum doesn't throttle dedicated lines at their guaranteed speeds, I suppose another cause may be the managed firewall that we have with them. It seems to be an older model, and from my knowledge it is performing tasks like Deep Packet Inspection. 
 We also use a shared building, with 2 other tenants in it. By paying for a dedicated line, would the other tenants in the building be using that line? From the agreement we signed, it looks like there are 3 address entries with the same address, so it seems plausible that we may not be getting that dedicated access, and that this may be a cost we should talk to the landlord about. 
 These are the theories I've come up with so far. I understand the value/cost associated with getting dedicated speeds, but it seems like we're pretty much being limited at these speeds. Any help is appreciated!

 I know that with Windows 10 and later you can just plug in a hard drive into any computer and it will re-adjust to new hardware and boot but with older Windows operating systems it will just blue screen because you will have to sysprep it first to be able to move it to another machine. But I can't boot this device anymore to sysprep it.
 What are my options to revive this operating system into another machine?

VLAN 20 (Limited Traffic hidden from other VLAN's)
 
 As it stands now I can hit the 13.10.5.0 traffic from 192.168.5.0 .

 seems to have fixed issues related to office apps / teams / network dropouts
 been battling these issues for months, and only in the last 24 hours I've tried uninstalling this app and it seems to have helped a lot of my users.
 fingers crossed this is the permanent fix.
 ​
 EDIT: lots of people saying "image/MDT ur endpoints"... These laptops are sent straight from vendor and are pushed via azure autopilot/Intune. This isn't uncommon for larger enterprises. Manufacturer's drivers still end up on these machines even though they are specced for our org,, this scenario is just different to what you'd see if you have the opportunity to get hands on with every single laptop you order.
 EDIT #2: removed some snarkiness from my initial edit. It was a long day, sorry 🙂
 EDIT #3: if this is helping you, u/SpongederpSquarefab pointed out that "Annoyling Dell Command installs Dell Optimizer lol". Important to note.

 I am having an issue with my HP ProCurve 2510s, they are randomly shutting down the interfaces which go back to my router and the event log states that a loop was detected and the port was shut down, but im not sure where the loop actually is.
 This is my config:
 Checkpoint 1450 Appliance (Router & FW)
 Multiple Port-Based VLANS, EG 10.0.70.0/24, 10.1.70.0/24 etc you get the idea. These are not tagged vlans. 
 Switch 1 (one dropping ports)
 The switch is configured to have untagged uplinks back to the checkpoint appliance. These links randomly drop for network loops being detected, but there is no logs on the checkpoint to suggest a network loop was detected either. The uplink to my other switch (100mbps half duplex) does not drop, but these are tagged vlans. No ports on the other 2510 drop either
 Each Port-Based vlan has its own IP (EG 10.0.70.1, 10.0.70.2 etc)
 im genuinely unsure where to look next in finding this network loop
 any help will be appreciated, i can share configs if required

 What happens with smartphones and tablets that promiscuously share wifi PSK-personal keys? Do they also attempt to share IPSK? 
 I see the Cisco implementation can tie it to a MAC address but these are also easily copied, so it seems like IPSK still has the potential to be widely shared and used by unauthorized devices.
 Probably a more important question is if there is some way for a wifi network to tell the clients, do not share our PSKs with other devices.

 Basic auth is gone for Exchange online, which isn't an issue for Windows or Mac users, but for our wonderful Linux userbase this is getting quite problematic it seems. 
 Microsoft is saying use an OAuth app to authenticate via IMAP/POP/SMTP.
 I am not new to OAuth app integrations, but this is a bit out of my league, and I have quite some concerns: 
  
It is saying to give "application" level access for IMAP and POP - not delegated
 It is saying to give the service principal for that specific application access to a specific Mailbox
  
Now this combination makes me think that I need to create a unique App integration for each linux user and assign this unique service principal to the users mailbox? 
 I cannot create one App integration with one secret, which I give to every linux user, and then assign the service principal to each of their mailboxes, each linux user can access every linux users mailbox?
 I don't really see an easy solution for this mess, how are you doing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have two edge SRX1500 firewalls, that I am replacing old cisco routers and firewalls with. My problem is just figuring out the failover situation during an ISP failover without using an edge switch or routers.
 Basically ISP1 would connect to the active SRX and ISP2 would connect to the passive SRX. My goal is to have it failover to the Passive SRX and ISP2, if ISP1 is down (i.e bgp down, link down etc...). I am thinking IP monitoring would be best for this situation. But I wanted to see if someone here has done something like this that maybe has a better way of doing it or if I am missing something?
 ​
 Other questions:
  
With an active/passive cluster, anything connected to the passive SRX never passes traffic, so presumably the BGP session with ISP2 would never come up until a failover occurs, correct? 
 With IP monitoring, if I wanted to fail back to ISP1 I presume that has to be done manually?

 As a side quest, what other sites are out there that give you the ability to easily store an offline copy that you update every few weeks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi thanks for clicking.
 My issue is that I have a NAT map table setup but my IP routes are not following said map. Instead of the internal IP using the statically mapped external IP, it is using the "dynamic NAT". There is no way to disable Dynamic NAT and it's not even a range of IPs it a singular "dynamic NAT" IP. I believe this is the cause of said dynamic NAT IP being block listed since I am trying to send out newsletters. How can I get my IP routes to follow my NAT map properly?
 I've been one the phone with my ISP and they've told me they cannot disable this dynamic NAT and that they really don't even have anymore control than I do.

 ​
 Since then the radius hasnt worked. gives an error message of 
 "An Access-Request message was received from RADIUS client 10.3.0.231 with a Message-Authenticator attribute that is not valid."
 ​
 This is on a windows 2012 server on latest october updates. Originally the merakis were on dhcp so the ip changed, which i assumed the issue was, changed and didnt work. changed the shared key incase it was wrong, didnt work, turned off needs to containg authenticator attrible ... still nothing.

 Any suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got one user at one client that, starting yesterday, is getting hammered with spam, but it's not your typical viagra or porn spam. They're getting signed up to hundreds of different websites, lots of different languages, mostly european, some asian, lots of dutch, german and polish, and we're getting all the account creation emails. Obviously they're on a list somewhere that got sold, but wondered if there some sort of new wordpress form or other vulnerability that's being exploited. Whatever bot it is, seems to hit a website multiple times; whatever it's filling out in the forms for a name is random characters as some of those forms copy back that data to the email.
 Blocking some of it with geoip policies, some with language polices, but it's hardly making a dent. We're using barracuda. I can't find any commonality in the headers other than some have references to a php mailer in the xheaders, but that's not nearly enough to fingerprint on to block.
 Told the user that if it doesn't settle down in a couple of days, we may have to dump his current email to a group and get him a new address.
 Anyone seeing similar or know the source? Better yet, have some sort of magic regex that catches all of it?

 I'm looking at the best way to do it.
 Of course I would like to build something that is fully replicated from my prod. 
 Right now my production Vms are hosted in a vcenter.
 My company does alreay have a lab vcenter and we would like to clone the prod Vms into this lab vcenter.
 We don't have the entreprise license of vmware, so the crossed vcenter functionnality is not available. 
 My question is more about how am I supposed to replicate the production ? 
 I can use cron with rsync or ansible to transfer files from the prod to the lab but I'm wondering if there isn't a better solution ? 
 Do you guys have any feedback on how to build a pre production environment, fully replicated with the production servers ?

Google meet obviously for the google meetings, Apple TV for mirroring the iPads when nobody is joining remotely, and the PC for all other meeting solutions that don't work with Google Meet. Since it's budget time we're looking for an all-in-one solution for joining meetings and the Smart board 6000s Pro seems like a pretty legit solution but I just don't know anybody who's actually used it. According to the product page it can join all of the major video conferencing platforms, and supports AirPlay mirroring, so it would wipe out all of the extra we have and users wouldn't have to change much. Does it have a lot of hardware compatibility in terms of webcams? Is it easy for users to use? Does it give a good experience when using it on all of the different meeting platforms? Anything I'm not thinking of?

 I've created this PS script to check on something in Citrix, but I don't know how to get it to email via our internal SMTP server, I'm tried a few examples via Google.
 The PS is:
 $obj = Get-BrokerDesktopGroup | Where-Object PublishedName -eq GSelector_W10 | Select-Object TotalDesktops, DesktopsAvailable, DesktopsInUse, Sessions, DesktopsUnregistered, DesktopsDisconnected, DesktopsFaulted, DesktopsPreparing If (($obj.DesktopsAvailable -eq 0) -or ($obj.TotalDesktops -eq 0)) { Send-MailMessage -From citrix-alert@domain.com -to me@domain.com -subject "Test Email" -body "Test message" -smtpserver smtpinternal.domain.com -port 25 } 
 Nothing arrives.
 However I was also trying to add the other values from the PS script so the body of the email message is something like:
  TotalDesktops = DesktopsAvailable = DesktopsInUse = Sessions = DesktopsUnregistered = DesktopsDisconnected = DesktopsFaulted = DesktopsPreparing = 
 Is this possible? I'm getting a little lost.
 Thanks

 This is a two part question. First part neccessary, in second topic I am not so sure about.
 Has anybody scripted to check for new updates, when found, do download and export to share? Later Dell servers iDRAC-s will check the share and upgrade its firmwares (BIOS, iDRAC) without reboot. 
 Once a month or so when operating systems get updates, servers will be rebooted automatically and upgraded firmwares will be in use. Do I dare to automate many server reboots in a mentioned way at once and soon possibly find out that many servers are not booting in case of firmware bug or something like that?

 So I am trying to solve a very annoying issue that users are starting to notice and while I am aware this probably should go to the r/office365 section I am more interested to see if sysadmins have seen this and if they have, how did you solve it?
 Basically the users would be working in Outlook with calendars open capturing meetings and the like. When changing from one day to the next at one point Outlook will not draw the bottom part of the calendar and wherever you click Outlook will click that amount of cells not rendered up or down. See screenshot for the example, I clicked in the blank space but the selection was above my click. https://imgur.com/a/KxOkHv6
 Initially I thought this was an Azure Virtual Machine issue but I have since been able to recreate it on a physical machine as well. I have tried the latest Office beta but the issue persists. I have reinstalled Office, recreated the profile, used Online only mode, tried the reg key to disable hardware acceleration, tried different hardware, tried different accounts. At this point I don't know what else to try and suspect it is a flaw in Office because I have seen this with a different user who has reproduced it in Excel workbooks that have formulas that changes the display while it is running.
 I have a open ticket with MS on this but I thought I would ask here as well. Anyone else seen this before? If so how did you solve it?

 I was checking a few mesh devices but all of them had this connection up to x number of devices.
 My question is, can we increase the number of devices that can be connected by increasing the number of APs in a mesh? (Assuming interference is not a problem)
 I checked Tp-link Deco XE75.
 Tp-link has written that it supports 200 devices but has not clarified that 200 in mesh or per AP.
 And if per AP, Does that mean 3AP = 600 devices in mesh?
 Thank you.

Is there a requirement for software dev? Before you ask I’m also reflecting these questions to the employer.

 There isn't direct access to the VPC so I'm using a proxy command in my SSH config using AWS session manager to access it. Connecting via SSH works fine but now I'm trying to tunnel on top of that to hit the web server and I'm hitting a wall.
 My current SSH config looks something like ... And it allows me to SSH to the instance
 Host i-* IndentityFile ~important.pem User ec2-user UserKnownHostsfike /dev/null ServerKeepAlive 60 ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target &h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
 I've tried adding a Dynamic forward and and tweaking my browser to use that as the proxy but no dice
 Anyone got any ideas? I'm stumped

 In this first phase they will only use this for halloween. They want to play a short movie/gif to wish users a happy halloween. So this is static on a specific date/for every user.
 With GPO I can create a taskschd for this.
 Does anyone know a program or something like that (lightweight ofcourse) to perform this task? Eg: a media player that starts immediate full screen and exit/quit automatically for example.
 Thanks for giving me tips in this "nice" task ;-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have an app similar to TikTok, so the media being served is mainly videos. We are adding a CDN now to both, reduce the costs and make the loading faster (Google Cloud CDN), and are not sure how to configure it.
  
Cache static content vs Force cache all content. I think we will go with foce all content since we want all content to be cached.
 Client time to live: I see no reason to refresh the media ever. The videos cannot be changed by the users. Once uploaded they can just delete the post or keep it. So I see no reason to have such time to live at all. We would just set it to 1 year as that is the maximum time to select. Is that the right choice?
 Custom response headers and Negative Caching Policy: Do we need this at the beginning? Or should we just consider it later to further improve things?

 - 2 PC hangs in the first 24h.
 - Snipping tool --> Print, attempts to open a print dialog then disappears without doing nothing.
 - Copy that same picture and paste into notepad --> Print. Stays "printing" forever but it doesn't print.
 - Printers --> [Select printer] --> Open queue --> "You need an app to open ms-print-queue". Going "shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}", print queue opens fine. Test page from the printer prints no issues.
 - Run ESET installer --> "Do you want to look for the app in the Store?" instead of just installing. Even selecting "Yes", it throws an error.
 Everything above wasn't happening 24h ago with W10. Dear Microsoft, if the product is not ready, DON'T RELEASE IT.
 I'm sorry, but needed that rant.

 Not good.
 I'm not allowed to just jank the time several hours leaving overlaps or gaps in the timestamps. So I have to be very gentle.
 What is a good way to very slowly correct the time over a few days, weeks even. Adjust a minute every hour or something like that.

 We have since last week, blue screens on 3 platforms / Microsoft Surface - HP laptop - HP desktop
 People can connect to their session but when it finishes to load, they have a blue screen, this can happens 3/4 times in a row when users restart before they can use their computer.
 The errors are either Kernel Failure or Driver failure.
 We deploy our OS (Win10 21h2) with sccm.
 We are trying to find what is happening, we looked into event logs, updated drivers and firmware, forced Windows Update but it keeps happening. We have quite a few GPO at logon and some script at startup but nothing was changed these past 2 weeks. We don't understand why we get these blue screens like that.
 Do you have any other ideas for this ?

I asked why not just drop spectrum and go full AT&T he explained he saw an article in 2020 saying companies should have isp redundancy in case of outages. I don’t see how this wouldn’t do anything but cause a potential headache trying to trunk and manage seperate isps. Any thoughts on this?

 Just want to get ideas and best practices to achieve this. Essentially in the case that there are multiple branches and each branch has to pay/communicate with a vendors etc.
 Management wants to say create a PayPal account per branch. Is it best to create an entire new email for the branch specifically for this service. Branch already has an email ex: " [branch01@xyz.com](mailto:branch01@xyz.com) "
 My idea is to create a DL as ["pp-branch01@xyz.com](mailto:"pp-branch01@xyz.com)" and set its users ( managment) to view these emails and request as apposed to using the " [branch01@xyz.com](mailto:branch01@xyz.com)" .
 I know a drawback is that DL wont have a stored location compared to a mailbox but I feel like creating 2 emails is unnecessary. 
 Using a DL will also avoid the branch email reading the PayPal email not intended for them or even delete it.
 Im all ears to know how your org handles this, thank you!

 Others ask me to take tests that attempt to identify how I think, solve problems, get along with others, ECT. These I can sympathize with a little more, but they always ask you to take them after talking to the hiring person, not anyone that knows a ton about the job
 Am I way off base here? I think they're just looking to weed out applicants...

 I started making custom classifiers / queues but then after asking specific questions about what traffic was going to flow over this, the contacts response was "it's a standalone PA system. The only traffic going through it is PA traffic / multicast traffic, so just a single vlan"
 He wants 4 different queues setup, each with a different DSCP ranking but...
 if the ONLY traffic is multicast traffic running on one vlan...what's the point?

 Just came out of a long ass meeting with this guy (Bob), and every department manager under the sun. Bob was trying to throw me under the bus because his software installed on half of our endpoints couldn’t report back to the management console for 6 months now. He's saying how my environment is trash, that I botched the deployment, that I didn't go to him to test, blah blah blah...
 Rewind 6 months.. Bob reached out to me asking for help because suddenly nothing is reporting back to the console. I was running a project at the time, so I didn't have a lot of time to do a deep dive but a quick look was showing that the proxy is blocking the software from contacting the console. I sent an email saying just that and that he would need to log a ticket to the security team to get the sorted.
 I guess he didn't do that, now everything is urgent and it's my fault. Everyone is starting to side with Bob then having a go at me. So, I pull one of my contacts from security into the meeting, asked him to whitelist the URLs used by the software, and voila! Suddenly it's working. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT BOB?
 In my livid state, I dug up that email I sent and forwarded to everyone in that meeting, then left meeting abruptly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Our main corporate location has been suffering from a rather annoying issue for almost a year now. We have a 600 user office in the midwestern United States. The trouble is, Google is classifying our public IP addresses as being in Brazil. This is rather annoying for our users, as search results return the Brazilian versions of websites as well as the search results appearing in Portuguese.
 We can easily switch the search results to English, but the Brazilian websites still appear as first results.
 Normally you can enable the browser to detect your location (probably also through public IP), however we have an Edge group policy disabling this. We are unable to enable this due to security concerns (even though every website can view our public IP anyways).
 Ultimately it looks like the issue is an incorrect location mapping in Google’s geo-cache. I have submitted multiple automated requests to get this updated (using this: https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en). However after around 50 submissions over various months, nothing has changed.
 We are a full Microsoft shop with no Google products (so no line of sight to any direct Google support). Looking up our public IP’s using ARIN show the correct address information. Other browser and IP based location services also correctly identify our location.
 Has anyone ever ran into this issue or have any ideas on how to remediate it? I know it’s nothing on our computers because Google correctly identifies the IP location of our remote users and all of our other offices. Unfortunately it is this one office with the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Team, I've been fighting with a Vendor who is putting all the blame on us for slowness - say's it's our network.
 Here are FACTS: (All tests done during off hours, no backups running)
 Location A >> IPsec VPN >> Location B
  
127Mbps TCP Upload
 156Mbps TCP Download
 635Mbps UDP Upload
 654Mbps UDP Download
  
Location A >> IPsec VPN >> Vendor's Azure Instance
  
64Mbps TCP Upload
 284Mbps TCP Download
 420Mbps UDP Upload
 483Mbps UDP Download
  
Location B >> IPsec VPN >> Vendor's Azure Instance (Same Instance)
  
326Mbps TCP Upload
 278Mbps TCP Download
 411Mbps UDP Upload
 461Mbps UDP Download
  
All traffic we pass to the vendor is TCP.
 Vendor says there is a problem on Office A's Network.
 This is my argument - Office A (My main site) can pass 127Mbps of TCP Traffic to Office B (My remote site) over an IPsec VPN Tunnel. This should mean, at a minimum, I should be able to see at least 127Mbps of traffic from Office A, to the Vendors Azure Instance. I know our Router can pass at least 127Mbps, however we're only able to pass 56Mbps to the vendor.
 The vendor says their Azure server is not setup with an active/active VPN, just failover. They're stating there is no load balancers in place.
 What am I missing? This has to be some sort of routing issue between the ISP to Azure, or, some sort of bottleneck in the vendors Azure environment right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had my Masters in Electrical and computer engineering. I was earlier interested in automation and robotics so I started working as a controls engineer. It is interesting working with CNCs, PLCs, and robots but I’m tired of working longer hours. With a job like this I either see longer hours, remote location or lots of travel. I’m unable to give my family much time as I’d like to. 
 I’m looking for something where I can also work from home. I had courses from networking in engineering and I’m fascinated so I started to learn a bit more for CCNA. I’m just worried I’ll have to start from scratch and will have to take a pay cut. I currently make between 90-100k. Is this a smart move or no? Can I make more pay once I get skilled in networking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I work for a small but quickly growing business that has a number of employees working partly or fully remote. The company has been upgrading all of the networking equipment for our relatively small on-premise server/domain, but I'm still running into issues with RDP accessed through the client VPN provided through a Cisco Meraki MX64 SD-WAN.
 The RDP/VPN connection seems to struggle mostly with video but it also sometimes drops for no real apparent reason. It's out of my normal scope of work but I've been attempting to troubleshoot down to at least a general root cause.
 After doing quite a few pings/traceroutes/MTRs from the MX64 I've noticed that the ping to the local ISP node (50.46.181.20) seems to spike semi-regularly from very respectable numbers (1-10ms) to strangely much higher numbers (20-40ms). The connection can cope when I'm just doing office work but seems to push latency tests (performed via testmy.net/latency) on my local machine into the 200-300ms on certain video calls.
 I'm not hoping to pin down a specific cause with these tests, but would highly appreciate any insight into where I should look further.

 That said, its nice to know whats out there and what people are using and what their projects are.
 For example i didn't know Eaton had Lithium based Batteries in their UPS line. I happen to know if not over charged Lithium Ion can last notably longer than lead acid, and Lithium Iron Phosphate Far longer than Lithium Ion. So the idea of Lithium based Units is quite interesting!

 We use an ITIL based system so some tickets are termination requests where they were properly termed, just not archived yet. Those I'm not too worried about (actually looks to be about 100 of them)
 But how do you handle 100s of incidents/break-fixes? Sometimes getting answers from people are pulling teeth with tweezers. Sometimes its a legit issue but there's just no good fix at the moment. I'd love to get this under control. I've added rules and tweaked the logic on the ticket system to require people to reply to tickets if I've replied to them (7 days from my reply, ticket automatically closed).

 [My cell phone rings - personal phone, but I also use it for business]Some Guy: Hi! I work for [company]. I got your info from LinkedIn [NOTE: my LinkedIn profile DOES NOT include my phone number at all] and I was wondering if you have a few minutes to talk about what tools you're currently using to secure your cloud infrastructure?
 Me: [context-switching and baffled] I can't talk now.
 SG: When can I give you a call later?
 Me: You can't.
 [CLICK, END]
 Listen, I'm not sure who needs to hear this, but if you are in sales and your job description includes a part where basically you need to cold call companies and try to social engineer their tech people, then I need to inform you that you, your job, the company you work for, or some combination of all three, truly suck and you should feel ashamed of yourself.
 If, however, you are actually a Black Hat, then.... you're doing a bang-up job! Keep going with your bad self!

 Am I doing something wrong, is it bad to untag a vlan in a trunking port?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to RDMA technology, and I'm confused by several rdma libraries. I cannot figure out the relationship among them. The libraries and kernel headers I'm confused with are as follows: 
 1.rdma-core/libibverbs
 2.rdma-core/librdmacm
 3.linux-5.4.2/include/rdma
 4.linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi/rdma
 My question is: 
 1.As far as I know. libibverbs provides the userspace applications with verbs api(i.e. functions with prefix ibv_), but it does not offer any connection-related functions, so applications need to exchange connection information using sockets(I see this operation in the libibverbs example rc_pingpong.c). librdmacm provides the user with easier connection management mechanism(e.g. rdma_get_cm_event). However, it seems that librdmacm does more work than connection management, since it also defines several apis(e.g. rdma_create_qp in rdma_cma.h) which looks similar to the ibv_function in libibverbs. So I do not know whether librdmacm is a superset of libibverbs? If not, what's the relationship between them?
 2.In the example rc_pingpong.c of libibverbs, I cound see it includes the header file verbs.h, and it seems that linux-5.4.2/include/rdma and linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi do not play any role in the program(no heaer files in these two directories are included). So what are the header files in these two directories aimed at? 
 I have refer to several materials but have not made it clear. Any explanation or related resources are well-appreciated. Thanks!
 taken from here but nobody had answered hence asking here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently have been working on moving our org to a security-key based MFA solution considering the various attacks against more traditional push, SMS, call, or TOTP MFA solutions. 
 As part of this process, I started looking at the various avenues of attack that could bypass FIDO/FIDO2/U2F MFA style authentication. Previously I would use something like EvilGoPhish to phish employees/customers and steal their session cookies to bypass MFA but this does not work with U2F.
 Then I came across an article that mentioned using WebUSB to defeat YubiKey and of course where one attack exists, other attacks also exist.
 The important quote from this entire article.
  
"Vervier and Orrù found that they could code a website to connect to the Yubikey Neo with that WebUSB feature, instead of with the usual Chrome API for U2F that it's designed to use. In doing so, they could circumvent the checks that the browser performs before querying the Yubikey—the checks that confirm that websites are the ones they claimed to be." 
  
Thankfully STIG has descriptions of how to disable both WebUSB and its sister technology WebBluetooth.
  
Disable WebUSB
 Disable WebBluetooth
 
 TL;DR WebUSB can be used for novel attacks to attack local security keys and bypass MFA.

 I'm setting up a lab in GNS3 to pilot enabling DHCP snooping and Dynamic ARP inspection. I got this setup and working properly with a Nexus 7k image, but it doesn't support port channels and I want to setup my lab to mirror the real environment as closely as possible. I got the Nexus 9k 10.1.1 image from Cisco and have it all configured, but I can't enable arp inspection because it says the ether-region needs to be set in TCAM. I've tried to do this but it throws an error. Trying to set any of the existing TCAM region entries to 0, saving the config, and rebooting results in no changes being made. There is a screenshot here - https://imgur.com/92E7B3a with more detail.
 Does anyone have any advice on how I can make this work?

 We have now run into the problem of to many SSIDs
 These SSIDs span over 2000 access points across the entire plant and we need them on every ap for roaming (I can't profile down any further)
 From what I can see from other large deployments companies are moving towards a few SSIDs with a large capacity -- eg instead of 4 SSIDs with 2000 clients we would have 1 ssid and call it "Manufacturing" and create a /20 network for it.. this also allows us to add more vlans to the blank group if we ever need to expand its size.
 We might also create 2 SSIDs 1 with FT and another with just adaptive.
 What are you large wireless folks doing.. looking for advice and reasons why to go one way over another

We're talking 100+ or so of them. This was done about a week or so ago. Monday, while i was checking my MM a bunch of the (down) APs popped up again on the MM. Minor nuisance really, as my APs in prod are working fine, but it's just weird that some came back. A lot of them had partial names to them too: e.g. an AP labelled "A-102" showed up as "A-10", etc. 
 ​
 Any idea what happened here? The only thing i can think of that changed was our Solarwinds alerting was enabled after the deployment was done. It wouldn't make sense since that's on the SW side.

It appears from message trace in Exchange Online, that one person on a distribution list (used for enquiries are sent from their website) are having them sent straight to their Junk Folder. 
 I've asked them to mark the domain as safe, but they are still being delivered to junk. I've looked in PowerShell using the get-inbox rule to see if they've set anything, but it gets no results. 
 It seems odd behavior that an internal email address would marked as junk for one user. Has anyone else seen this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in my IT shop the security teams seems to run everything, and make all the decisions. The security team is not super tech savvy to put it nicely , but will just log into server and make changes not knowing what they are doing. An example it logging into Windows servers and stop/disabling the firewall service. They seem to be making all the decisions for the enterprise environment, software to use or not use. I am not talking like we will not allow some software because we see it as a security issue which is actually their job, but like running the evaluation of major software like Okta (which i like by the way) then buying it and forcing it on the rest of IT without their testing or input. They seem to spec out the hardware not just say ever device needs to be from proper sources and have TPM etc. But they have no idea about hardware or how it works. They are opposed to anything open source which kills me. I am very cautious about open source, but sometimes it just is needed. To many example for non open source vendors with huge security issues that they don't fix or disclose. Security by obscurity. They love to hold everyone's feet to the fire about change control but do impacting things without using the change board, nor notifying the impacted persons. Like someday getting an e-mail from the application that your admin privileges are gone without any notice. CIO seems to be ok with this. Like cyber is doing all the work on the move the cloud? 
 This all seems really backwards for me, but I need perspective. My idea of security it to set policy, weigh in on enforcement changes, set infrastructure goals for the actual sysadmins to move toward a more secure posture, deal with incidents, and stuff like that. Not hands on doing IT's job.

 I'm a past Nutanix customer and had nothing but good experiences with those appliances, but for whatever reason our higher ups dislike the name and brand because our past appliances were "slow" and "clunky" and didn't seem interested in hearing about how we were past due for refreshes as we were one of the early adopters of nutanix back in 2013 and were still running essentially 8 year old gear. its a bit of a long and complicated story, but we had to gut all our nutanix stuff after covid budget cuts happened, So i just have a feeling Nutanix wont be considered.
 the other 2 contenders we are looking at are Dell vxrail and HPE dHCI. I'd like to ask which of these 2 would you go with if you had a choice? or if there is something different all together you'd recommend? the VM cluster is very overprovisioned for what we have, so this will be a bit of a rightsizing attempt based on current workloads. consuming about 40-50GHz of CPU at rest, 500GB of Memory, and about 15TB of storage. a full flash solution would be my preference to keep our IOPS performance equivalent to Pure. Cloud is not an option at this point

 Despite my many efforts to use a ticketing system, they say "we have tried in the past but it just doesn't work" we have a Microsoft to-do list because according to them it's essentially the same thing. This leads me to often get either in trouble or my wrist slapped because I'm "working on things that are not important" and it leads me to get calls from my boss regularly, or when I have all my obvious projects done for the day I get the "What are you doing right now" which sometimes is "Nothing" which is never a good answer but its an honest one. 
 I've just been so frustrated, especially since the pay is $4 an hour less than my best friend who does very similar work 10 minutes away. it Doesn't help that my boss seems bipolar half the time, I am 21, and he is around 24 so we will often talk about girls, cars, etc. but a lot of the time I feel treated like a dog, it's like he treats me like I don't know anything and will talk down to me and just generally treats me bad. 
 I'm really conflicted, I overall like it here, and I've only been here a year but it's becoming so much more often that I think "I could just leave right here and now"

 Today... that update is gone and I'm back on the older version. I don't know if this is Microsoft backpedaling or just something weird with my machine.
 Anyone else noticing the changes and/or experience user calls? 
 More info: the latest version for windows - October 12th presents a significant update to the Electron Framework. from 10.x to 16.x Likely the cause of the issues/bugs, because you know, Microsoft likes to QA/Beta Test on customers now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know the first answer everyone's going to want to post is JAMF, but my current Mac presence is not that strong, and there are plans to stop issuing Macs altogether, but for the time being I'm trying to come up with a solution that doesn't involve a new service, with yet another set of licensing.
 I've been configuring an Intune environment, which is working fine for Windows/Autopilot, however I do see there are MacOS options. I'm wondering how useful this is, to those of you that have worked with Mac in Intune.
 I'm assuming autopilot is out of the question, and our help desk will still need to do some manual stuff, but I'm hoping some could shed light on a few questions:
  
Is there an OS deployment function for MacOS, similar to Autopilot?
 These are just going for be for a full AzureAD environment, not hybrid. Does that make a difference?
 The laptop will need a local user account created, right?
 Can we register all of the Macs to a single Apple ID, in the event of a user forgetting their password or something?
 Is a local admin account possible, if so, doable through Intune?
 Lastly, any recommendations for remote control software. I've used ManageEngine, TeamViewer, Dameware in the past. Not sure Dameware is even a thing anymore, TeamViewer might be possible but looking for what you guys have found to be most efficient.

 Apparently, OME is using ECB encryption which seems to be not much of a step above message obfuscation instead of being a secure encryption method.
 So, if you have a requirement to send secure email, OME is not meeting that requirement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 We have a product which sends out system notifications to our customers Sysadmins etc. We use SendGrid to send these emails (which works like a charm BTW).
 However - several of our customers are asking if we can send the e-mail from their domain (so that the FROM field would be ["someone@customerdomain.com](mailto:"@customerdomain.com)".
 I've looked into the whole authenticated domain setup in SendGrid (which we went through ourselves) - and this seems like the correct approach. However: 
 1) What would the most "correct" approach be? Should we create a subuser and then authenticate domains for each of our customers on this subuser? Sending our customers the SPF record etc. generated by SendGrid.
 2) We're not all that interested in doing this manually every time a customer asks. Does anyone have experience with using the SendGrid API for authenticating domains? 
 I'm a developer (not a Sysadmin), so I'm a bit worried to mess something up. Basically we just want to use our SendGrid account to send emails from different domains (approved by the owners of the domains).
 Could anyone walk me through the correct way to do this?
 I've tried reaching out to SendGrid support, but they just keep sending me to the same "How authenticated domains work"-article, which doesn't explain the scenario I'm interested in. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I currently have a MAN with ~20 sites interconnected with dark fibers, in a sort of a ring topology, plus a dozen WAN sites. All these sites are l2 connected (even WAN sites with metro-ethernet) so I have sometimes typical l2 issues (broadcast storm, stp misconfig...). To overcome these problems, I am thinking of doing a redesign of this network with consultants but before meeting them, I would like your views on what are the current technologies used for this type of network and what are the pro/cons.
 My needs: 
 - L3VPN but also sometimes L2VPN for legacy applications, 
 - the simpler solution the best from an exploitation point of view, 
 - ideally throughtput between sites should be 40+/50+ Gbps
 - and stable (but does it really need to be specified :-)
 I did some research, there seems to be 3 main technologies for this type of network: evpn/vxlan, traditional mpls, and sr mpls which seems to be the "new simplified" mpls (perhaps i overlooked some). From a budget standpoint, the evpn/vxlan solution seems cheaper because available on switchs, and mpls seems to be available only on router hardware which could be expensive if i need to go for 50+ Gbps interfaces.
 ​
 Thank you for your help.

I ran a Wireshark capture on one of the machines exhibiting this behavior consistently and it showed that the machine was communicating with the website but the page continues to spin. I don't see anything different in the communication either before or after the nic disabling except that the browser loads. I see no certificate failures and that is not something showing as the issue on the browser. It also happens if the page is internal to our company or external. We have had the desktop tech update the nic drivers but I don't think that's the cause. We have had the proxy server bypassed for the testing machine. I have not had the anti-virus turned off yet because I don't see any failures communicating with the server in the Wireshark capture.
 Has anyone ever seen this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We are used to have dedicated management interfaces on network devices. As more and more functions/features are hosted on x86 devices, it's natural to implement the same management mechanism.
 To avoid mixing management and data planes, multiple routing tables have to be implemented. There are, from my understanding, three ways to do it :
 - namespace
 - table + ip rule from/to
 - vrf (added to linux kernel thanks to cumulus)
 Excluding namespaces which are too heavy for this need, what could differenciate the two last propositions?
 I can feel that vrf have a stronger implementation/traffic isolation but it seems that the result are approximately the same ?
 Thank you,
 Romain

I was wondering if there was any benefit to blacklisting these clients after repeated failed auth for a period of time? Am I right to think this would free up some AP capacity as they will ignore that client for the duration of the blacklisting meaning less resources are wasted on talking to a client that is failing auth. Any other suggestions on how to improve welcome. Thanks.

According to a new study from Wanclouds, 81% of IT leaders say their C-suite has directed them to reduce or take on no additional cloud spending as costs skyrocket and market headwinds worsen. After multiple years of unimpeded cloud growth, the findings suggest enterprises’ soaring cloud spending may tempered as talks of a looming downturn heat up.
 As organizations move forward with digital transformations they set out on at the beginning of the pandemic, multicloud usage is becoming increasingly unwieldy, and costs are difficult to manage across hybrid environments.
 Furthermore, a wrench has been thrown into IT teams’ plans over the last two quarters in the form of the market tumult. Rising inflation and interest rates, along with fears of a potential recession have put increasing financial and operational strain on organizations. As a result, many companies are reevaluating their digital ambitions as cloud spending is brought under the microscope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Since about a year, Microsoft refuses to offer us support through Teams-calls and instead only wants to reach out by phone. For us, having calls over the phone instead of Teams is quite inconvenient as we prefer having multiple team-members on the support call at the same time. Of course, it's possible to have multi-person phone calls, but it's obviously not as optimized as Teams. Also, scheduling Teams-meetings through the calendar in Outlook (which we used to do) instead of 'verbally' by mail brings the added benefit of not having to miss calls because the support-engineer mixed up his timezones. Finally, sharing single screens through Teams is better than being forced to share your entire desktop through Quick Assist.
 Does anybody know why they do this? When we ask, they avoid the question. For us, it's both inconvenient, irritating and strange, because it looks like they deem Teams to be an unsafe way of communicating. Before this, I generally had great experiences with MS Support, but this is just really annoying.

 Here's the deal:
  
There is an office with two floors, each with a different type of user. Type "A" use the Windows keyboard layout "X" and type "B" use the Windows keyboard layout "Y".
 Each floor has its own VLAN and DHCP server.
 Computers may be arbitrarily moved between floors, so the same computer may be used by both user types.
 All computers and users are domain joined. All computers are in the same OU. "A" type users are in the "A" OU and "B" type users are in the "B" OU.
 Each computer has a hypervisor running a Windows VM. Every time a computer is shut down, the VM goes back to its original state.
 All computers shut down automatically at 21:00 and turn on automatically at 07:00.
  
How would you ensure user type "A" has the Windows keyboard layout "X" preconfigured on the Windows logon screen?
 How would you ensure user type "B" has the Windows keyboard layout "Y" preconfigured on the Windows logon screen?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I have tried with a powershell computer startup script that changes the relevant registry values depending on the Windows VM gateway, but it doesn't work (it works if executed manually after user login, so it's not a scripting issue), maybe because when the script is executed Windows doesn't have a gateway yet?
 Here's the part of the script I used to get the gateway:
  
$ip = Get-NetIPConfiguration | Foreach IPv4DefaultGateway | Select-Object NextHop
 $gateway = $ip.NextHop.ToString()
  
Going passwordless is my last resort!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow geeks! I need some suggestions for my application.
 I have a server and I need to read around 200files per second, they are image TIFF sequences and the size per file can be from 100kps to 3megas. I need to read this files in Real Time and it works but after a while (30seconds) the read times slow down a bit as the drives/bandwidth has reached the limit and needs more time to deliver the files.
 I currently have a server grade NVME PCI gen 3 raid controller (don't have the server in hand) and it handles 8nvmes. I have it set for Raid 0 but maybe on my specific case could Raid 1 be more beneficial?
 The reason I'm wondering this that if the controller asks for a single 100kps file to 8 diferent drives and needs to wait for all 8 to provide the data before it can proceed to the next file and it needs to do this 200 times a second maybe on Raid 1 2 drives have the same file and could potentially provide a more consistent random access performance?
 This is very specific and um trying to get some more knowledge. Thanks in advance

However, for security reasons, we would like to force users to type their password in at least once week, instead of a PIN or using their face/biometrics. This will mean that they will have to type their long passwords and the system would block them from using any other sign-in method in particular instance.
 We plan to roll out Windows Hello for Business via Intune.
 Is this possible to do and if so, how can we go about doing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing some clever (stupid?) routing between leaf (bgp, L3 fabric) and openstack (software routing in overlays).
 I got to the point, when I have two (or more) routes, and only one is valid (i.e. can deliver traffic to the consumer). The difference between them is that in one case there is active nexthop IP, and in other there is none. Nexthop is connected through a bridge, therefore it's impossible to use link state to check if nexthop is available or not. The single way is to check if it can be resolved via arp.
 There are other ways to solve my problem (healthchecks, hooks into openstack code, etc), but I wanted to investigate feasibility of the nexthop 'resolving' (in this context, resolving of IP into MAC, i.e. arp). Are there the name of this technique? Is someone using it?
 Basically, I have a route:
  x.x.x.0/24 via y.y.y.y dev foobar 
 And this route should only be taken in account when y.y.y.y can be seen as a neighbor in ip neighbors, and ignored, if not.
 I use bird for bgp, so it's either bird feature (check nexthop resolvability), or linux routing feature.
 Is this a thing, or should I try other ways?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We planning to migrate the CA within the same domain. The Old Certificate Authority (Legacy Cryptographic Provider) has permission to issue the Old smartcard logon v3 certificate template. The new Certificate Authority (Crypto Next Generation) has permission to issue the New smartcard logon v4 certificate template (both templates are configured the same except for the cryptography tab). The most interesting customization in the templates below:
 In both templates, the following parameters are configured in the Issuance Requirements tab:
 This number of authorized signatures 1
 application policy
 Certificate Request Agent
 Valid existing certificate
 We have a lot of users using smart cards to logon, to reduce the load on our help desk (enrollment agent) we want to use the Supersedence template. So that our users can reissue certificates on their own / autoenrollment. To do this, use the criterion in the Issuance Requirements tab: Valid existing certificate
 In the New smart card logon certificate template, the Supersedens template tab contains the Old smartcard logon certificate template, certificate templates are replaced correctly with us.
 The question is:
 The user receives a request to renew/autoenroll the certificate in tray OS balloon, the user sees the required template that has been replaced ( New smartcard logon ), but when continuing to work with the certificate issuance wizard, the user is requested to sign the enrollment agent.
 Tell me, is this because the certificate issued by the Old smartcard logon template does not fall under the Valid existing certificate flag for the New smartcard logon template certificate?
 Do I understand correctly that this will not work without an enrollment agent in such a configuration?
 We cannot refuse to use the enrollment agent, we must control new users and issue a certificate for them.
 Thank you for help.

Basically my role is to take care of a POC environment AKA lab manager for their pre & post sales engineers to deploy their respective solutions for demo to their potential customers. The problem is, I have no idea what's going on with my lab and my reporting manager then was too busy to entertain my inquiry, most of the time they outright ignore me.
 After a year for some reason I've been assigned to a new reporting manager who happens to be the principal SA for the lab. Met them privately to discuss my dissatisfaction and what I really want for years to come. In the end they promised to get me involved more in whatever pertaining to the lab and to be frank, I don't buy it. I was right though because so far it's same shit just different person.
 This really demotivates me as I believe what they're doing devalues me as an experienced engineer for 7 years not to mention the jobscope that they promised during the hiring is far from the reality. I'm more than just that guy who holds CMDB for the lab and gives "consultation" to presales engineers every single day. Been thinking of jumping ship so far not landing any gig.

 I'm currently looking for console server data solution for mainly Cisco devices. What do you think about out of band (SIM CARD or wifi based(?) ) console servers - theoretically sounds very good - how about the practice ?
 Also there're some other requirements we would like to have:
  
minimum of 16 interfaces
 possibility to use RJ45 to RJ45 UTP cables for simplicity and longer range cross-rack connectivity (than simple Cisco console cables).
 Continuing from 2 - the device should be able to rollover programmatically that cable (also - how this function is called - (software selectable pins) ?). Because manually changing pins from straight through to rollover in UTP cable from standard is not very sustainable solution. In Ethernet world similar thing is called auto-mdix - it's interesting how this thing is called in serial world :)
  
Any suggestions ? Thanks

When testing LAPS, we have set the name of the administrator account to manage to be RAccess, and were expecting to see the LAPS password applied to that account. What is happening is that the disabled built in administrator account is being re-enabled, renamed to RAccess2 and the LAPS password is being applied to that account. We're rolling out the client via SCCM, and have tried installing it both before and after adding the devices to an OU with LAPS set up. Any ideas where to go next would be appreciated. Everything that I have read suggests that LAPS will not create, enable or rename accounts. We can recover the LAPS password OK, so it looks as all Schema and OU setup has been done correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been running the numbers and for a small organization with a file, app, and SQL server doing a fairly nominal amount of processing, Azure seems to make financial sense when looking at on-prem alternatives (physical host running ESXi or HyperV). Are any of you migrating existing environments totally to Azure at this point? Especially given the uncertainty of VMware licensing with Broadcom, I’m thinking this might be the last big wave of on-prem for SMBs. Am I missing anything on the horizon?

 It would be a lot of work and not something that I would find particularly enjoyable. Furthermore, it almost seems like admitting defeat: our stuff is so complicated, evidently, that you need a book to understand it!

Could one of you be hired into such a situation, where nobody has any Domain Admin access and there was no remaining account left (all admins used smart cards with unknown PINs). Would you figure it out before it's too late, as a total outsider? You could get datacenter access of course, just no ideas on accounts/credentials. Let's say, a mishmash of 300 servers (mostly VMs, Server 2012 R2 or Server 2019), 1500 workstations (mostly W10), up to 300 users on VDI, and 2000 employees total.
 Are there reasonably-priced outside services that specialize in recovering in such situations to save a company that accidentally their SysAdmins?

 A bit of background - I'm helping out a small tax office that has two sites. Site one has 5 desktops and the other has 2. 
 Site one has a Synology Nas Active Directory environment. 
 Site two the users have an account on each pc. 
 They want to be able to share files between the two sites and use roaming profiles.
 I don't like the Synology and would like them on a windows environment. 
 I'm use to supporting a large corporate IT environment. So the solutions that I'm use to just don't make business sense to a Small office. 
 If one of you can prescribe us a setup that would be awesome!
 A traditional option and a cloud hybrid option.
 Thank you for reading :D

 I'm testing a firewall in my lab, decided to do a little BGP just for kicks and ended up here. In the past few hours, I've learned all sorts of strange things in regards to rules that some ISPs have when peering with customers. Are ISPs generally that anal when peering with customers?

A week later (Today) a head hunting company contacts me on indeed about a job "i would be PERFECT for".. Guess which job it was for.. Yep, the one that rejected me. I told them they rejected me and they asked if I want to apply anyways I told em "Screw it, Go for it lets see what happens". Thats when I get another email about a job in my town from a different head hunter company, and then another, and another, and another. So far 7 different head hunters from different companies have contacted me regarding this position. I've said yes to every single one. Why? Because f--k them, thats why.

The first was just a new hire that needed an attitude check and literally was an asshole in front of the IT manager and IT director. So they backed me and even commended me for not retaliating. 
 We have no help desk. I was promoted years ago and they never replaced me. So for about 200+ it's primarily me juggling stupid help desk and admin/engineering work with my boss helping occasionally. 
 All of this guys tickets are closed and resolved. Like it's my fault he doesn't ask to reopen tickets or put new ones in if something reoccurs. My bad I'm not babysitting you non stop while I have 1000 other things to do.

 Is that practice still considered best? I've been seeing automated emails from vendors with the FROM address being the root domain. Are they just being careless? Obviously best practices are likely applied, (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)... but is that considered enough to the point where companies are using their root domain to send automated emails out that way.

 Hi folks,
 ​
 I'm a high school teacher, running a great computer science department and we recently added a (for college credit) course in information security.
 ​
 I'm attempting to find out some information for the sake of my students interested in working in this field. I was hoping to get some guidance on credentials, certifications, college education, that sort of thing.
 I'm not the type of teacher who wants to just tell all of his students to go get a bachelor's degree if it's not necessarily going to suit them well for their career. Are there other ideas out there that are more appropriate? Do you need a B.S. to even get in the door? What subject area(s)?

 Thank you for any insight you might be able to share!

 upload [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [ 5] 0.00-60.04 sec 38.0 GBytes 5.44 Gbits/sec receiver download [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [ 5] 0.00-60.04 sec 26.3 GBytes 3.76 Gbits/sec 89 sender bidir [ ID][Role] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [ 5][RX-S] 0.00-60.03 sec 37.0 GBytes 5.29 Gbits/sec receiver [ 8][TX-S] 0.00-60.03 sec 25.7 GBytes 3.68 Gbits/sec 72 sender 
 Of course, better results with 8 threads:
 upload (-P8) [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [SUM] 0.00-60.02 sec 54.6 GBytes 7.82 Gbits/sec receiver download (-P8) [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [SUM] 0.00-60.01 sec 49.6 GBytes 7.10 Gbits/sec 685 sender bidir (-P8) [ ID][Role] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [SUM][RX-S] 0.00-60.01 sec 40.3 GBytes 5.77 Gbits/sec receiver [SUM][TX-S] 0.00-60.01 sec 26.8 GBytes 3.84 Gbits/sec 224 sender 
 I notice the bidirectional performance is slightly better, but basically the same with more threads. Is this a NIC limitation or possibly tuning? I know the x520 is fairly old by now. 
 Has anyone done any testing like this? Has anyone tested NAT throughput on more affordable hardware like Mikrotik or Ubiquiti?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding is that if let's say there are multiple devices in a LAN and device A wants to make request to a webserver on the internet -
 Source IP of A will be replaced with the IP of the router from the packet which is going out to the WAN.
 So if the source was 10.10.0.1:9876 and IP of router was 125.12.31.7 then router will translate source to 125.12.31.7:5000 (5000 being a random available port) 
 Now the router will note down :
 Source : 125.12.31.7:5000 = 10.10.0.1:9876 
 So that when the packet comes back from the server it will look up in the table and send it to the Computer A. 
 If this computer A had made multiple requests, they all would have been allotted different portnumbers from the available pool. Same if Computer B had made a request. 
 So basically it's the unique port number which is being used here to determine where to send the packed when it enters router from outside world. 
 What if the number of requests from within the LAN to WAN exceeded the number of available port numbers? What would happen? I mean there are only 64,512 (65,535 -1,023) available ports at max.

My IT Director asked me to look into finding a Smart Card solution so that employees can log into PCs. We're a small Hospital and many of the nurse stations have give or take 5 communal PCs that they need to log into the domain to use. I've tried convincing my boss to remove that step and just use a limited Kiosk account as all patient information is locked behind a second login and a remote connection (Parallells), but that's been like trying to pull teeth. So, I'm trying to make this as easy as possible for our staff to log into their accounts and get things done. Any ideas for a badge scan or fingerprint solution to speed up the process? I really don't have a lot of experience in this very specific subject and Googling this subject has been a mess. Figured you guys would have at least some recommendations.

 He definitely is not liking my suggestions.
 Edit: please note, per the below MS article
  
Very large (25 GB or larger): An .ost file of this size increases the frequency of short pauses, especially while you are downloading new email messages.

These devices are all custom and not capable of having additional software installed on them.
 I have attempted to connect these devices to GlobalProtect enabled RaspberryPi devices, sharing the GP IP, which gives them access into our network, but this solution fails because the devices are not visible behind the Pi, and are not reachable to have code pushed to them.
 We have deployed at least 1 home firewall for a key developer but this is not a sustainable approach. Is anyone familiar with a product that would fit this need, or deployed something similar?
 Also, ideally the solution would have some sort of security (at least MAC auth) so that any random device can not connect to our network.

 We formerly had desktops, but we moved to a new office that the CEO insisted on setting up as a flexible workspace, so everyone needed laptops, and then covid showed up and we went remote.
 We currently have MS Surfaces (the CEO's choice) through a 3rd party vendor. Most people seem to really like them, but I'm getting complaints from a few people that then need more powerful ones. Particularly a few people complain about the amount of ram they come with. I've got a user insisting they need at least 64 GB of ram to work properly, more than is available in a surface. I'm deeply skeptical of this particular user's claim, but that's a different issue. I sent him to his department head to argue with him about getting the budget. If he actually gets budget to buy one, I'll need to source it whether I think he really needs it or not. 
 Anyway, what sort of laptops do you all like to send out? How much ram do they typically have?

 I recently took a new job and was hired to help get a new software up and running. As I'm going through the requirements, I can't find the options they want. I do my best, then email the software support asking if I'm missing anything. The support emails back that what I need isn't even an option available. 
 So who authorized this? If the software can't do the main thing you want it to do, who agreed to purchase it?!? Was the request even asked to the selling company before purchasing? What am I going to do with this software now? Thousands of dollars wasted.
 I'll never know because I joined on after it was already purchased. But holy shit does it get me heated. End rant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've inherited a network that is using public IPs inside it's LAN. I've been tasked to begin cleaning these up and make them proper private IPs. Another fun fact about this network is that the original designer tagged Vlan 1 on all uplink ports. Of course Vlan 1 is still also the default & native vlan throughout the network. Our main data subnet, cameras and door controls are all on Vlan 1 across the entire company.
 The project requirement is to implement department vlans at our main site and have a few other vlans at other remote sites as needed. Of course they want to move the cameras off the data subnet and also use vlans for IOT, printers, and a few other departments at some sites.
 Our WAN is connected using AT&T Metro ASE Layer 2. We have an Aruba 3810 L3 Switch as the gateway at each site. IP Routing is enabled on each of these L3 Switches.
 We have 12 remote sites, STP is in use at each site, but we only connect using static routes. No ospf, rip, bgp, etc.
 My initial thought is to first install all of the new subnets/vlans throughout the network. Then slowly begin moving the Vlan 1 devices over to the new subnets. We have a server team that will handle most of the systems that will need their IP changed so my main task is to ensure connectivity.
 How would you handle moving users off of Vlan 1 onto the new subnets? For all you L2 WAN folks, is there a better way to approach this?
 I appreciate your thoughts & inputs.

 ​
  
Microsoft has received reports that after installing KB5018427, some types of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) connections might have handshake failures. Note for developers: Affected connections are likely to be sending multiple frames within a single input buffer, specifically one or more complete records with a partial record that is less than 5 bytes all sent in a single buffer. When this issue is encountered, your app will receive SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE when the connection fails.

 I am about to do some testing with the monthly update and wondering what I should look for that might necessitate the OoB patch to also be deployed along with the cumulative.

 RDS/Citrix would be overkill at my present position as a one-man show in a small office with just a couple of FT remotes and a few people who sometimes work remotely.
 ConnectWise Control Access pricing is very attractive. I would prefer to use it for support anyway, so I wanted to hear what others were doing in smaller offices with limited remote users.

 I've recently started working as a sysadmin + network guy for a small business, around 50 employees and up to a 100 devices if we take into account mobile phones.
 The company has a dumpster tier firewall that's basically not doing anything and a vm running pfsense for openvpn. There are around 8 ubiquiti 'enterprise' switches in the network and a few APs. 
 I would like to replace the firewall with something a bit more manageable and feature rich. Naturally i'm thinking of Fortinet etc for the price but I've also seen the Dream Machine Pro from Ubiquiti which has the features we need at a really low price (I assume it's not a great unit...) and would allow me to manage the rest of our switches centrally. You can't even monitor traffic on the switches without a gateway anyway which sucks so I'm tempted to go down this route instead.
 If the dream machine pro supported openvpn for remote workers I would grab it but it doesn't so I'm still hesitant. 
 Do you guys think it's better to grab an actual enterprise level switch from Fortinet or maybe a pfsense plus box from netgate instead of a dream machine pro?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I just got hired as an "IT Specialist" at a non-profit. I have little networking experience outside of installing switches, etc. (Fieldnation). They did not have a IT person before me. I am starting mostly starting from scratch.
 What I would like help with is building my stack. Currently, they are using Google Workspace and trying out Goodday for task management. They are a hybrid of Macs and a few pcs that they purchaced before hiring me. I am thinking about moving from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 because that is what I am used to. In addition too, they are willing and able to move to a windows environment. This company has been very reassuring that I can move them in any direction and they will pay for it. Their major priority for is a new phone system. I am looking for a VOIP option. They also purchased a Sharp BP-70C55/70C65 before I got hired. It will get installed soon.
 We are about to split the current office team and move to a different floor.
 I feel like with help and research, I can groom this organization to a greater level.

 I appreciate you all's help!!

 ​
 I'm managing the (2) computers of a small library few hours a week, and i want to block adults sites on them.
 I've tried to block them using hosts file with this list : https://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/blacklists/
 But it froze explorer.exe, maybe due to the length of the file (4.5M lines) and the poor capacity of the computers.
 ​
 Do you have a smaller banlist which be usable on low config ?
 Should i try something else like changing the DNS ? (is openDNS good ?)
 Or do you have good parental control software to suggest ?
 ​

 Do not run the PowerShell as an Administrator, unless you absolutely need to. So, when do you need to? When you are changing local system setting or deleting/modifying files that only Administrators have access to. When in doubt, run PowerShell normally and just try to run the command you wanna run.
 You never need to run a PowerShell as an Administrator, when you are remotely configuring resources, through PSSessions, CIM/WMI, or when using any other cmdlet that has a -Credentialparameter, such as the AD module.
 The gist of it is this: If you do not know why you need admin permissions, you should not use admin permissions.

 The errors I got were:
  
Irql not less or equal
 
Kmode exception not handled
 
Page fault in nonpaged area
 
Unexpected kernel mode trap
 
 This was all very late into the night so I decided to shut it off from bios when I got the chance and now today I decided to remove some plugged in USB devices and I also removed my second monitor (which uses a DVI adapter)
 Today it hasn't crash once so far, I have plugged back in the usb devices but not the second monitor.
 I kinda suspect on the SSD because windows is installed in it, it's also a drive I bought back in 2019, and it's a 256gb drive with over 30TB of writes according to crystal disk info, but it also says that it's in good health. The drive also has tons of hours since I usually let the PC on 24/7.
 Now, should I replace this drive nonetheless? Could the problem really be the DVI adapter? (I ran into problems with it before but it had been working for months until yesterday)
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel as though I'm going insane. For the life of me, I cannot track down the cause of why this is happening. 
 A website I host https://semdeck.com (for reasons I cannot figure out) is showing two forward slashes at the end of it so it appears as semdeck.com//
 I've set it up the same as every other website I've ever built. Here is part of the .htaccess file:
  
# Always use https for secure connections 
 # Replace 'www.example.com' with your domain name 
 # (as it appears on your SSL certificate) 
 RewriteEngine On 
 RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
 RewriteRule ^(.\)$ https://semdeck.com//$1 [R=301,L]* 
 <IfModule mod\_rewrite.c> 
 RewriteBase / 
 # rule 1: remove multiple leading slashes (directly after the TLD) 
 RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \s/{2,} 
 RewriteRule (.\) $1 [R=301,L]* 
 # rule 2: remove multiple slashes in the requested path 
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.\)/{2,}(.*)$* 
 RewriteRule (.\) %1/%2 [R=301,L]* 
 </IfModule>
  
And the functions.php file contains the following:
  
/\** 
 \ Define Constants* 
 \/* 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_VERSION', '3.9.2' ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_SETTINGS', 'astra-settings' ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_DIR', trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_URI', trailingslashit( esc_url( get_template_directory_uri() ) ) );
  
I thought that both of those are signaling that there should only be one "/" at the end of the domain but I guess not. Either way, I am completely out of guesses as to why this is happening. Perhaps a plugin conflict? I've gone into Yoast SEO and even modded the canonical URL for the homepage to no avail.
 Anyone have any idea what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some context:
 I work for a computer refurbishing/resale shop. We operate mostly through online sales and handle hundreds of laptops and desktops a month. I typically am responsible for refurbishing and repairing units for resale.
 We set up a WDS server just running on a local network (not connected publicly) using an old netgear router for handling DHCP to quickly load units. The WDS is configured properly and works , as long as the images are good.
 The issue I run into is sometimes is dism doesnt pull a good image from a unit, and breaks the WDS (Shows no available images if a bad image is present) . It took me a solid 3 weeks to figure out what was going on, but eventually came to the conclusion that if I delete the bad image from the server, then the WDS continues working properly.
 ​
 My question is this,
 Why are some images bad? and how can I fix it? 85% of images I make work flawlessly, while some simply refuse to make a working image. 
 Steps taken so far:
 Most recently we got some Dell 7460 AIO's in, around 40 of them. I created an image as I always do, and loaded it on to the server. The issue occurred so I deleted the image and used a different unit to make an image, still no dice. I then tried using dism healthcheck and repair commands, dism sees nothing wrong with the image. I tried using compression on the image to see if that would make a difference. The image is Windows 11 Pro, and the Dell Optiplex 7460 is fully updated. I also tried making a Windows 10 image and that did not work either.
 I'm not sure if there is a correlation but here are some of the other models I cant get a working image for:
 Lenovo T540P
 Dell Latitude 5491
 Lenovo T460
 ​
 I cant understand why the WDS will simply reject some models. I'm hoping someone has some insight.
 ​

There’s still remnants of the old layer 2 192.168.x.x around and the ultimate goal is to get rid of it completely but that is going to be a rather complex and lengthy process due to VPN tunnels and a bunch of other things. 
 What I need to figure out is how to get that 192.168.x.x network on to the new side of the network. I need to migrate VMs that are on the 192 side over to new hardware that lives on the other side of the firewall. It is both physically and logically separated other than the firewall that has an interface for each side. New fiber and cables have been ran for the new side of the network. The image below shows an example of how the network is designed and what I’m trying to accomplish. I thought about changing vlan tags and tagging everything on the new side and trying an untagged vlan for the 192 but I’m needing some help and ideas.

But the real issue is sometimes they don't want to include "contractors". We know who these folks are from Okta. But I cant make them use distribution lists, if they just want to send it to all.
 Does anyone have a good example of naming conventions for fixing the "employee type" problem? We have all the data/okta to solve this. Its mostly just doing a better job this time.
 "management" has proposed:
  
all@ for full/contingent workers
 all-extended@ for everyone human(no service accounts)
 contractors@ for contractors
  
This scenario would be CFO sending out internal financials, wants to not send to contractors.
 I personally hate all-extended. It reeks of all-except-some, and global-not-sales vibes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most admins have Office 365 test tenants to simulate a small corporate environment to test scripts, install apps, and explore the new configurations without affecting the production environment. But, few admins run the scripts (which are downloaded from the internet) directly in the production domain. It's not good to run any scripts directly to the production. 
 Admins can maintain the Office 365 test lab without an additional cost through Microsoft 365 Developer Program. You can use the test tenant for years if you use it regularly. Otherwise, it would expire in 90 days. You can't retrieve data from the deleted tenant. So, If you have a budget that you can spend for your test tenant, then you better go with a business subscription.
 How do you maintain Office 365 test setups? You can share your techniques with fellow admins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greeting,
 I find my self looking for a program that a small team could use to log what work they have done so that if in the future one of the other members needs to look up information on a old project he can find it easely. 
 A little more explanation as English is my third language and the explanaion on top is a bit vague.
 Recently a senior colleague unfortanatly passed away unexpectedly and now the 3 of us that are left find our self in a bit of a pickle as we are getting questions on how to manage past systems he has set up withouth having any documentation on the process he used to set up said systems. Most of the time things are written down in Word and stored locally somewhere or backed up to the archive under vague names. 
 So this got me thinking that there should be a program out there that is on prem (since we cannot use cloud features due to security reasons) that one can get, where whe can use it as a work log that anyone of use can access and see how and what other people have done on past projects.
 P.S. I hope this is the correct subreddit for this question, if not let me know and I will delete the post (also if you know the correct subredit, I would appreciate that info).

I have found some information but they are talking about gMSA and "run as" / "give full control" to an application as domain admin.
 The situation is, that in our organisation we develop applications ourselves and to execute them administrative permissions are neccessary to update / install and/or run the application. 
 I don't want to give myself a lot of work in maintaining and continously sending an IT employee their way to authorize an installation.
 Anyone has some tips to get around this issue? Without losing security? Because I preferrably want to withdraw all admin permissions and only give them out when needed. So I am curious if sysadmins here have a creative solution for this?
 Again thanks for the help in advance!

However i have searched far and wide over the Ethernet and i could not come up with a possible implementation that already exist more because the terms "ip scheduling" provide result in different topics.
 For my current project i have a couple of devices connected over a closed network to my main server. This server is publicly reachable on another Ethernet interface. The devices are normally accessed because packages are forwarded from the server by nginx/iptables config through the server. The idea was that there is a front-end hosted on the main server where people can reserve a time slot to gain access to one of these internal devices. Then only in said time slot would the packages be forwarded and else dropped.
 ​
 It feels like i am not the first one to implement such a feature. However i have searched far and wide over the Ethernet and i could not come up with a possible implementation that already exist more because the terms "ip scheduling" and like wise search queries provide result in different topics like human resources or dhcp static ip reservation (github was full of people making there own hotel reservations systems which would often popup).
 ​
 Therefore the question if someone may now if such a system already exist? If not i could write my own with nginx or iptables something as the gatekeeper is my plan.

The main reason why I was so careless is because the sender name was very similar to one of our customers. The virus itself was bundled inside of an img file. We use sophos central email gateway with all bells and whistles enabled - including the sandbox. The mail made it through all of that, windows 11 defender (also with all bells and whistles enabled) didn't catch it either. 
 With the help of someone smarter than me we managed to gain access to the ftp server that the virus uses to upload extracted login information. Afterwards we sent an abuse notice to the hoster who immediately deleted all contents and locked the customer out. 
 We use the default sophos list for blocked attachment file types (sophos specifically recommends using it instead of making a list on your own!). I'm trying to change that to a whitelist so for example only PDF files are allowed everything else goes into quarantine. But apparently sophos central doesn't even have that option or am I blind?

 ​
 First, if this is not supposed to be posted here, you all have my sincere apologies.
 ​
 I am a web developer (don't throw stones yet ^^ ) and I come to you looking for advice.
 ​
 As a pet project, I am building an application to streamline data collection in non technical teams.
 It is a server based application (PHP) with a web interface so I would see it either as a cloud product or on an in house server.
 I am trying to do things the right way, and one of my next steps is to think about user authentication.
 For the basics, i made a username or email | password authentication, users stored in the database, password encrypted using bcrypt. The administrator create user accounts and generate an account specific url for account activation. Transmission of the url is the responsibility of the admin.
 To go further, I plan on implementing some SSO methods.
 My guesses are:
  
google
 openId
 microsoft AD (this one will be fun to debug, as I never understood windows server XD)
  
Finally come the question:
 If you had to sysadmin such a solution, what SSO solution would you expect to find by default ?
 (And to go further, what kind of functionnality would you expect to find out of the box ? )
 ​
 Thank you in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am just having the discussion of whether or not to remove users from the AAD sync when de-provisioning.
 We are in a hybrid environment. During user deprovisioning, after the users are disabled and the associated license groups are removed, we currently keep them synchronized via AAD Connect.
 ​
 I know that when the users are de-provisioned, they are moved to an OU in AD that is not synchronized by AAD-Connect.
 ​
 I can't find a "best practice" or similar in the Microsoft documentation, is there a recommendation from Microsoft?
 ​
 How do you guys handle this?

 I've been trying to configure custom URL handlers that work on Mac's for our business, but without any success. We want a handler to open links to local files, and open these files with Finder.
 So far I've tried:
 Lincastor https://onflapp.github.io/blog/pages/LinCastor.html
 RCDefaultApp https://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/
 SwiftDefaultApp https://github.com/LordKamina/SwiftDefaultApps
 https://hublog.hubmed.org/archives/001154 
 RCDefaultApp & SwiftDefaultApp are outdated and not compatible with the OS version we're using, while Lincastor doesn't do anything when I add a new URL handler.
 Can anyone help me out? I'm relatively new to MacOS. The macOS version we currently have installed is Monterey.
 Thank you!

 We're currently trying to secure the network even more and we'd like to setup 802.1x auth for printers to put allowed printers in the correct vlan, and unknown devices in a quarantine vlan.
 Computers are authenticated using their AD computer account, and printer don't have that.
 Certificates are also not a good solution since printers are not able to request renewal themselves... 
 I've seen posts saying "you just have to create a AD user account with the macaddress and same for the password" but no one seems to care about the fact that this is a huge security issue.
 The only thing I found was to create a "Connection Request Policy" for each MAC and put them above every other regular policies.
 Conditions are :
 - Calling station ID = mac address
 - NAS Port Type = Ethernet
 Settings :
 - Authentication : Accept users without validating credentials
 It does not have to be 100% secure but at least prevent users from connecting untrusted devices like some 3rd party contractor who comes for the day and needs "internet"... but I'm still looking for ideas or a better way to do it.
 Thanks in advance :)

 https://imgur.com/a/nrG2JcM for a basic network diagram
 Had an issue where *out of nowhere, after years of this setup* the Cisco ASA got flooded with 169.254 addresses and killed the network. 
 I know what you're thinking - why the f*** do you have such cheap dumb ass unmanaged networking equipment for a 30 user environment? Because we're cheap and stupid and have no money. Believe me I've tried. I don't want to go any further into my thoughts in case of this post being found to be honest, but it is not a favourable position I am in.
 Anyways,
 I figured there was maybe a network loop happening, with this being just as the office was closing I got everyone to leave and I powered everything off. I determined that 1 small switch with 2 computers hanging off it was tripping the network when powered back on. The other switches/computers were repowered and are OK.
 The 2 computers appear fine, like I have pretty detailed software inventories using our endpoint protection agent, and indeed plugging the laptops in elsewhere, no issue.
 This is where I am out of diagnosis, knowledge, experience and wit. So I guess I can blame the switch being worth about $10, but why would it be spamming 169.254 addresses?
 I have now plugged the "faulty" switch in elsewhere and it no longer trips the network. Has this been a red herring all along?
 Moral of story is - we need better equipment so I can actually see which ports/devices these addresses were coming from. But I am still in the sad situation where I cannot properly explain the outage, so hoping for ideas.
 ***Disclaimer. I bring this post with great humility, regret and pleading forgiveness. Yes, it is barely an amateur setup for a business turning over millions of $. Just trying to get by.

 In the system log I find one entry:
 The Group Policy settings for the user were processed successfully. New settings from 0 Group Policy objects were detected and applied.
 Both log sources indicate that all user GPOs vanished from the client. gpresult shows for the user details under "Organizational Unit" that I am in a OU where inheritance is blocked and no GPO applies. However, this is not the case. My user is in the right OU!
 When I manually run a gpupdate /force everything goes back to normal. Nothing else was changed, indicating that it should have worked the whole time.

 Since SPMT didnt give me any sort of errors, and telling me that no files was skipped, i belived that everything was in perfect order.
 However, i can see that it is far from in perfect order. Lots of files and folders is missing. And it seems random which files is missing and which dont. There is no difference in rights on the folders, where files is missing, and there are no obvious reason to why the files are missing.
 Running an incremental task with SPMT makes no difference, it wont acknowledge that there are files it doesn't sync up.
 Its quite a large filedrive. My original plan was to sync everything with OneDrive to a temp location on a fileserver, and then have something like FreeFileSync to compare files and sync the missing files. But is not a viable way since OneDrive taking a really long time to get something in sync, and i dont really believe that it can handle all that data, because its also freezing up on me.
 ​
 TLDR;
 So im looking for some tool, not SPMT, since experience, that can compare my files on the fileserver to a Sharepoint site and sync the missing files. Preferably free.
 Ideas?

I asked the tech about removing the 3-way splitter in place, wondering if it had degraded and possibly causing issues. The tech tested the signals with an expensive looking tool and determined the signals coming in were good. At one point, he did indicate we could remove the splitter without issue. But, them he tested it again before proceeding and noticed an issue. 
 The way the tech explained it was if we remove the splitter, we would gain 5dB somewhere, but then lose 5dB somewhere else which would push past a certain threshold that would cause sync issues. Im not even sure it was dB, but I have to assume. He wasnt great at talking smart and I wasnt great at knowing what he was talkinh about. Im not an expert in coax cable signaling and understanding readings. I have worked at an ISP in tech support and understand the basics and sync issues, but I never got trained or learned much about this. Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working in tech support (just over 3 years now) and really am wanting to move over to sysadmin. I've sent out a handful of applications and am having no luck so far. I've realized that there is a huge gap in knowledge and experience between tech support and sysadmin.
 I am "level 2" at my company and deal with our business products so I work with admins vs home users which has given me some understanding of what a sysadmin is, but I'm still missing a lot of what's required for a sysadmin position.
 Is a helpdesk job going to be my best option for getting into a sysadmin role? I'm hesitant to pursue helpdesk since I'll more than likely lose a noticeable amount of pay, but there is no more growth for me in tech support and I would be able to make more in the long run as a sysadmin.
 Has anyone here gone directly from tech support to sysadmin? If so, any advice on making that switch?

 I work in IT for a small insurance firm. I accidentally discovered that our website was having issues loading when troubleshooting a different problem and found some random text in german appearing on the homepage. Upon inspecting the source code there are TONS of links that point to gambling websites and other stuff involving crypto. Our insureds use the website to log into their portal which doesn’t contain any PHI but it does have PII such as addresses, phone numbers, etc.. Is it safe to assume that there are keyloggers stealing login credentials and possibly worse things going on?
 I emailed our webdev but he isn’t in the office today and hasn’t responded yet. I’m not sure what our next steps should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grumpy old IT guy, coming in hot again.
 We had a filesystem migration to a new server this weekend. Figured there would be a few hiccups, given how thorough (/s) our testing team was. Sure enough got a P1 ticket that they are unable to process files from a system this morning. Turns out they were using sftp to push files up to the old server for one of the data flows.
 So, easy enough fix. Once I was sucked into the P1 group call this morning, I told them exactly what needed to be done. Put in a request to get ssh access to the new server, and here is the new path to the directory. Easy peasy, just like I sent out last week.
 Cut to 6 hours later. The call now has over 20 people on it, including management. They are dissecting all the data flow diagrams, and just ruled out the application server as the issue about an hour ago. Two managers asked me to rejoin the call, and before they could even 'recap' everything they've done so far, I pasted a screenshot of what I told them needed to be done from 6 hours ago, and got dead silence.
 Seems one of the offshore managers (yes, this is ALL coming from our offshore "support partner"), stepped in at the end of the call this morning to manage the issue. They are supposedly working on the access requests now and will let me know. In other news, now management wants me to write up an RCA as to the problem, and corrective instructions. Sure, no one read my emails over the last couple weeks warning of this change, they ignored my instructions for the fix this morning, and the still don't seem to fathom what they did wrong. That about covers it.

We're running out of IP addresses on the /23 network, would it be okay to increase the network to a /22 without causing broadcast issues or, is a /22 too large of a broadcast domain?
 Normally I would just create a additional subnet/ VLAN however, creating a second network/ VLAN wouldn't be ideal as ideally we need a single SSID.
 We use DHCP exclusively on this subnet with no static addresses - would it be a good idea to increase the network to a /22 but only increase our DHCP scope to 6-700 IP addresses to limit the size of the broadcast domain as much as possible?

Considering the wealth of PDF viewers available, to say nothing of the fact that most modern browsers can open them natively, I was wondering what the user backlash would be if we just uninstalled it across the board. Then the question would be whether to replace it with, well, nothing (i.e let them use browsers) or instead deploy Foxit or PDF-Xchange or whatever.
 Anyone ever covered anything like that?
 ADDENDUM: I don't mean Adobe Acrobat. Just Reader. Acrobat certainly has its vulnerabilities too but a hugely smaller foothold in the fleet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 We are currently using EAP-TLS with Computer Certificates to authenticate corporate assets before granting them access to our network using EAP-TLS. We have recently been discussing whether to extend this to the chaining of both Machine and User authentication.
 We are currently discussing whether to perform the User Authentication using PEAP (EAP-MSCHAPV2) or EAP-TLS with a User Certificate. 
 For Machine Auth I would always use Certificates rather than PEAP, but is it just as easy to manage user certificates? And are there any security concerns? From a Machine Auth perspective, the user has no business touching the certificate unless they have local administrator rights on the PC (And they don't).
 In this case, the Certificate will be issued to the User itself, so what kind of access do they get to the certificate? Will they be able to possibly export it with a few tweaks even though we issue it as 'non-exportable' from a PKI perspective? The fact that they have just the slightest access to the certificate itself, makes me wonder if it would be best to stick with PEAP for User Auth and keep Certificate Based Auth for the Machine only.

I spotted a PowerEdge R740 Server at a company that recently did a partial hardware refresh. They have 5x 3.84 TB SAS SSD's in this server, which seems a bit unusual to me. I would have expected to see an even number of drives for SSD's, not an odd number. I thought RAID5 shouldn't be used with SSD's? A single boot drive doesn't seem like a good idea (plus 3.84 TB is a lot for a boot drive). I suppose one could be a hot spare since they don't have on-site IT Staff, nor do they have an MSP. Their IT Department is at their main office hundreds of miles away and they fly in as-needed. 
 Anyway, just curious as to why there would be a 5x 3.84TB SAS SSD Setup?

 We used to run all HP printers. Recently we have picked up some Epson color printers. I had no issues with the m401n printers, they run and use off brand ink.
 I need to buy some new ones, I see the HP 4001n is a replacement. The reviews aren't great, and I have been unhappy with the newer HP LaserJet printers requiring HP ink (404dn).
 This specific use case is printing AP bills and reports, all black and white, medium volume. A few hundred pages once or twice a week. ethernet connection is preferred in our environment. 500-700 range preferred price. As far as size goes the 401n fits perfectly on his desk.
 Does anybody have anything they like?

The reason for the alert was that mdstat was showing "UUU_", which normally means that the 4th slot has a failed disk. 
 After reading a bit, I thought that perhaps he should remove that 4th disk from the array, but he didn't want to do that, so instead he'll just disable the alert. The full conversation is [here](https://community.netdata.cloud/t/critical-mdstat-disks-alert-on-4-bay-synology-nas-with-3-drives-shr1/3387). What do you think? Is it ok for mdstat to be showing a failed disk that's just not there and will never be there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I am a developer and manage a few IIS servers serving mostly ASP.net classic and core web applications. I am bombarded by probing hits to various attacks. Like someone incessantly hitting /xmlrpc.php or /wordpress/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml, neither which are a feature supported on the server. They are mostly Asia or RIPE hits. I cannot do geo blocking as I do allow access to many of these countries. 
 I use a product called RDPguard that intercepts attempts to RDP, FTP and other services and bans IPs via Windows firewall for n hours when they fail out. I am wondering, is there a means via a module or small addin to do something like this but only for IIS 403/404 requests that fail? One IP has hit that wordpress URL 80 times before failing out, only to try again an hour later. Obviously I added their IP to a deny list but they will just come back on another stolen IP or proxy later.
 I realize I can use IIS to deny patterns, but the 404 handler is doing that already. I want to block that IP if possible on the 10'th time for 4 hours. 
 Ideally I would set up 10 or so common strings I am seeing in logs. Some are even just basic SQL injection phrases, like a select * in the query string. I don't want to implement a full IPS just yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Afternoon all
 ​
 I have under my care a Windows Server 2019 Standard, V1809, OS Build 17763.3532
 It's main purpose is Backup
 It Runs Veeam Backup and Replication.
 ​
 It is Directly connected to a cluster of ISCSI Switches. a 10GB connection into either one and setup with Nic Teaming for the two 10GB Nic's
 We have also tried this with just the singular 10gb with no Teaming and experience the same issues.
 ​
 Now onto my issue
 ​
 Randomly we have a major ISCSI failure which results in a total network loss which results in failed backups.
 I have attempted to get support from Veeam But as far as they are concerned its an infrastructure issue and not their problem to deal with.
 ​
 ​
 Now onto my issue
 It all starts with an error IScsiPrt Error 20 in eventviewer
 then we get in mixed order Event ID - 129,9,39,27,63,43,10
 ​
 In Eventviewer i see those Event ID's in no particular order and often 9 repeats a few times in a row.
 what this represents physically is a total network loss 
 ​
 After a few Hrs systems seem to stabilise the errors stop and the network re-establishes
 and backup pick up where they left off.
 ​
 We do eventually have successful backups
 ​
 This issue occurs at what appears to be random to me (i cannot find a solid item to pinpoint the start of this issue from)
 I am at the end of my tether, have attempted every fix i could find, including registry edits and as men=tioned above adding a secondary 10Gb Nic.
 ​
 But the issue keeps re-occuring
 Please help

 An example is OVH, which displays its backbones and relative "load" percentages at this address: http://weathermap.ovh.net/#europe
 Another example is the GARR network which allows you to view more data than the previous one, also including graphs of aggregate traffic on the links.
 Also Nerim (France ISP) if you click on "Accès Invité" its share own graphs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping to get a second set of eyes to make sure I'm not overlooking something obvious on this one (likely). I did reach out to my vendor, but they weren't really much help.
 ​
 A user of mine appears to have had their mailbox compromised. It was then used to communicate with their accountant to request etransfers be made. The email itself was very poorly crafted and shouldn't have fooled a 6 year old, and it was even filtered to spam. My concern though is making sure I'm reading the logs correctly and making sure any security holes I stupidly left open get closed, so it doesn't happen again.
 ​
 The mailbox had a randomized password with enforced MFA and no app passwords in use. These measures were in place before the supposed compromise happened.
 There are no secondary SPF records that would be allowing sending from another source (website, mail service, etc).
 If I do a message trace on the sender's mailbox, the message shows up. The sending mail server is a godaddy address.
 There are no send connectors, custom user mailbox rules, etc in place and I've confirmed there's no delegate/send as access for the account.
 ​
 ​
 TLDR: I'm positive I'm overlooking something basic here. Would I just be sleepily misreading the logs and it's a junk spoofing attempt which is why it would have initially been filtered in spam? I haven't dug into 365 logs much in the past but had assumed unauthenticated mail wouldn't be showing in a user's message trace.

 Hope y'all are having a nice Monday so far.
 ​
 Question.... I am currently implementing a new Client Authentication template that will be configured to use Autoenrollment in order to get deployed to client machines.
 ​
 This new template in question, I have also decided to configure Template Supersedence. I have added 2-3 templates that I want this certificate to supersede. 
 ​
 After logging into a test machine that has older certificates deployed in it's store, I do receive the new template and it also removes the older certificate as is expected with the supersedence.
 ​
 Now, here comes the million dollar question. If my machine was provisoned using Autopilot and this process installs a certificate using SCEP, would this certificate also get removed from the machine if the template is configured as a superseded template?
 ​
 Reason I am asking is that this scep certificate doesn't seem to be removed when I log on to the machine. I'm wondering why. The only difference with other certificates was the method by which it was deployed (Configuration Profile instead of Autoenrollment through group policy).

 Apparently, it's been happening since last week, but not many users complained. When we investigated this issue today, we found several other users have the same issue, and they all had KB5018410 installed, and those that didn't have this issue didn't have the update installed. We uninstalled this update from the affected machines, and everything started working again!
 We do use RDS Farm with UDP, so not sure if it's related.

 It offers my two options
  
 X20 LTE-A (DW5821e) with eSIM
  X20 LTE-A (DW5821e) without eSIM
  
They are both the same price.
 Why would I choose the "without eSIM" variant? Does the "with eSIM" variant no support regular SIMs as well?
 To add confusion, I have found DW5821e chips only that mention "eSIM only". I can't imagine this is true but still... very confusing

 I can narrow down our list of suspects by running Wireshark captures while correlating local ports to process IDs with TCPview, which is fine on my own machines, but not really feasible with impacted clients who we're pulling out of their production work to run test cases for us.
 The sticking point is preserving the list of PIDs and correlating to source ports. I can get the PIDs from tasklist, but that's just a single point in time. I can get the PID to local port linkage from netstat, but that's also just a single point in time. I could enable process auditing, but our Security event logs already roll over too fast to scope troubleshooting across a full day because of file auditing (Splunk is tightly controlled with a formal change process, so that's out for stretching the log storage in any kind of timely fashion).
 I'm aware I may be able to catch this in ETL format, but my ETW game is weak and limited to: pktmon capture > pktmon etl2pcap > read in Wireshark; I have no experience at all with collecting app data in ETL.
 At the end of the day, I'm just looking for a single tool I can run that can get me these four fields for diagnostic purposes:
  
<PID>
 <Process Name>
 <Source IP>:<Source Port>
 <Destination IP>:<Destination Port>

 There are a plethora of snippet manager apps for developers, with syntax highlighting, etc, available for macOS, eg: - SnipperApp - Snip - massCode - SnippetsLab - Quiver
 ...and so on. 
 Some of those are free, some are one time payment, and some are subscription. Some are simple, some more elaborate, but all of the ones above are really designed for Developers - the syntax highlighting supports only programming and scripting languages, really. 
 I was wondering if any of you guys who are network engineers and also mac users have an app that would serve well as a snippet manager with syntax highlighting for Cisco, Juniper and other network config formats? 
 I'm currently using MacVim with vim-wiki plugin, and it works reasonably well, but I would like something with a bit more structure, where I can more easily search through and look for notes / config snippets.

I'm not confortable with this setup, but perhaps it's just me;
 I wonder if there's a downside in using many disks vs growing an existing one and modifying the partition table. Apparently the volume overhead is minimal, so it shouldn't be an issue. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm working with a vendor and they have their SMTP system where they input the normal settings for SMTP. It keeps failing in their system (Says check credentials, even though I'm 100% sure it's not the credentials), I thought it was their system because when I use the website below, it works fine and sends me an email using the SMTP information I provide. Also, we use SMTP for scan to email on printers for this same account which also works fine. So I know for a fact SMTP is working correctly for this account that we are testing.
 https://dnschecker.org/smtp-test-tool.php
 Settings used:
 SMTP SERVER: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Email From: Scanner@G**********.com
 Email to: (Myself)
 Use Secured Connection enabled
 Use Authentication enabled
 username: Scanner@G**********.com
 Password: (Scanner's Password)
 Outcome: Success
 ​
 However, I just checked a different tool, using the exact same settings and it's failing on the below website that requires the exact same information.
 https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test
 Settings used:
 SMTP SERVER: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Email From: Scanner@G**********.com
 Email to: (Myself)
 Use Secured Connection enabled
 Use Authentication enabled
 username: Scanner@G**********.com
 Password: (Scanner's Password)
 Outcome: Failed
 ​
 Anyone know why SMTP would work for somethings but not others? I would expect as long as it's using the same Port. server, security and username information it would work if it's working for other SMTP tools.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 we are a medium sized dev company. As of today, any application is developed in our own tenant. Devs are able to register new apps, grant (most) delegated permissions and start hacking away (loosely speaking).
 There are a couple of issues I see with that approach:
  
Apps grant permissions to production data.
 Bugs or misuse can lead to data loss.
 App credential stealing can lead to data loss and leaks.
 Registering enterprise apps can lead to data leaks.
  
For that reason, I'd wish that development is out-sourced to a non-production tenant. Or better: Each project gets their own tenant. We have a couple of dozen parallel projects and this could prevent teams getting in each others way - even if that would be only by accident.
 There are currently two ways I can imagine how this works:
  
For every new project, a standalone tenant must be registered. If licenses are needed, they must buy-in. Ideally, this is managed completely separate from IT e.g., by the project manager or a designated tenant-owner. They manage the tenant registration, credit-card info and payments, licensing. We have a devops-department, maybe also they could take over dev-tenant management company-wide.
 For every new project, a M365 developer subscription sandbox is registered. The upside to this is that it is batteries-included with licensing and sample data in most used areas like EXO and SP. The downside is that this tenant is linked to a person in the company, who may leave the company at any point in time. (Now that I think of it, we could use service accounts to have this not linked to real people.)
  
I imagine that this tenant should not be managed by IT at all. The project members are responsible for security, compliance and data privacy.
 How are you guys managing this kind of stuff? Are there other solutions I have not thought of yet?

Neither he nor I have tons of experience. Today a server rebooted and when it came up again the SQL server was down due to expired evaluation as I found out, when reviewing the logs.
 Turns out the reason for not having a license was that it was too expensive for us, but as long as the DB was >10GB it shouldn't be a problem I was told, but tuns out that only applies if you use the express version. We only need this particular server for 1.5 months more before it will be taken down anyway.
 Is it possible to migrate the db from the standard edition to the express? I also read an article saying that I can turn back the clock on the server, but I fear that may lead to complications with other systems, though that would be an easy solution given we only need it for 6 more weeks.
 I am frankly a little out of my depth here. I'm good at figuring stuff out by furiously googling and never giving up and I have worked as a junior sysadmin for two years and have been dabbling with homelabs etc for many years. I'm decent with networking and Linux, but I have not worked much at all with SQL, especially not MS SQL. 
 Could I buy a license for just two months perhaps? Please help, this is a production system.
 What should I do?

 We are looking for electronic document signing solutions, we need to cover two scenarios:
  
About 30 people work with external entities - NDAs, quality certificates etc. Very low frequency of use, one or two per user per month. Something similar to DocuSign. 
 
About 150 people internal use only - to establish formal traceability in various internal process documents. High frequency of use, up to several dozen per day.
 
 DocuSign and other similar products rack up costs exceedingly fast.
 Can anyone suggest more economical solutions? We can live with two different products for external and internal use if there is a cost benefit.

Our contracted network engineer has refused to have a Linux VM or an Internal CA on our network to make this project work according to any documentation I find online.
 He has provided me with a third-party wildcard certificate for our domain and has set up a Windows Server 2016 for me to use for the project. Is there any way for me to specify the wildcard certificate in the CaddyFile to be used for each reverse proxy without needing to declare a DNS challenge as according to the documentation. I currently have it creating local certificates with Caddy's internal CA but it will still give a warning to end users and most will not know how to allow exceptions.
 As I am new to using Caddy and failed miserably trying to set up a reverse proxy through IIS any suggestions would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excuse the rant.
 Depending on my sleep or coffee levels, it's either amusing or infuriating the sort of things I see because DMARC. I'll ignore everything else for now, this is just DMARC.
 Common, daily occurrences include:
  
Sending DMARC reports for received DMARC reports
 Receiving a "mailbox full" error for dmarc@some-idiot.com
 Receiving a "message rejected by spam filter" because the message attachment contains blacklisted IPs. Huh I wonder why those are there
 Receiving a "mailbox does not exist" error, because reasons.
  
And my new, personal favorite: 
 "INEPT-COMPANY Request received - Report Domain: inept-company.com Submitter: dmarc-sender.com Report-ID: inept-company.com.1665896400.1665982800"
 That's right, their DMARC address is listed as support@ which is their Zendesk address. So any DMARC reports sent are going to end up automatically creating a ticket!
 I don't know what's worse, their ineptitude at understanding how to setup a mailbox to take a set of messages every day, or how their support team feels dealing with the daily ticket influx of a completely automated and unactionable message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 ​
 Been bashing my head against a wall on this one. I am renewing an SSL cert for my RDGateway server. Done it plenty of times, never an issue. This one, however, when I apply the cert users can't login and event log shows 0xC000035B. Replace the new cert with the original one (not due to expire for a few more days), and all good again.
 I figured it might be the cert (somehow), so I tried adding our wildcard cert to the RD Gateway instead. Sure enough, same error. Put the original rds.domain .com cert back in, it works.
 I found various articles suggesting setting EnforceChannelBinding to 0 (via regedit) on the RDG server, which out of curiosity I've done - no difference. I also set LMCompatibilityLevel on my PC to 3, no good. No other posts I've found so far that have to do with that error code have much else info i'm afraid.
 Has anyone else ever seen a new SSL cert cause users to fail logging in? Or does anyone have any ideas where to start looking? Nothing has changed server-side other than the cert, and besides - you'd think if it had, the old cert would have broken... Thanks in advance!
 ​
 EDIT: The only thing different from the last time is that there's a new firewall in that does HTTPS inspection (or something along those lines, it's managed by a 3rd-party). I'm reaching out to them, in case it's the difference in SSL certs causing this, but does that sound likely to anyone else? (i'm fairly new to HTTPS inspection sorry)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've got a branch office that was previously sending Internet traffic to the ISP and local office subnet over an IPsec tunnel w/ bgp. The plan now is to send local subnet traffic AND all internet traffic over this tunnel (in this case, the other end is Prisma cloud, but scenario should be the same if it was the HQ) This is my first time sending all traffic over the tunnel, so the routing intricacies escape me a bit. 
 https://imgur.com/a/jYJZweo A scribble diagram to help visualize and give better detail.
 ​
 So initially, changing the next hop for 0.0.0.0/0 to Tunnel.1 would bring the office completely down. My understanding now is that it's basically trying to send the IKE and ESP traffic etc over a tunnel that doesn't exist yet.
 ​
 So I've done a little bit of research and it sound like I have to have a static route that goes to the ISP still, but at a lower priority:
 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop eth1.4 172.0.0.2 (isp) Priority 15
 for the IKE/ESP traffic for tunnel creation.
 ​
 Then have another route for all other traffic (local subnet and Internet) with a higher priority, so local office traffic flows as before and so Internet traffic can pass to Prisma/HQ for inspection.
 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop tunnel.1 Priority 10
 ​
 The tunnel traffic is also using BGP, the traffic to the ISP is not.
 ​
 Any insight and/or corrections welcome! Thank you all in advance!

 I'm in the process of deploying a new 2-tier PKI so will consist of a Root CA and subordinate CA. I've done plenty of research around recommended validity periods for Root CA and subordinate CA - however I've recently read up on the Y2038 bug.
 The idea was to deploy the new Root CA with a validity period of 20 years and then the subordinate for half of that period however this will take the expiry date past the year 2038 - I'm just curious how is everyone else dealing with this bug - are you deploying CA certificate with a date prior to this date?
 Reading the bug it only seems to effect legacy systems that use 32bit integer for the time.
 Just curious how y'all are working around this!
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this to the CCNP subreddit but got no response, hope it's okay to ask here.
 I'm reading the OCG CCNP book and I'm a little confused at its explanation of how BPDU filter works when enabled globally. Here's what it says:
 "The global BPDU filter configuration uses the command spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default, and the port sends a series of 10 to 12 BPDUs. If the switch receives any BPDUs, it checks to identify which switch is more preferred.
 ■ The preferred switch does not process any BPDUs that it receives, but it still transmits BPDUs to inferior downstream switches.
 ■ A switch that is not the preferred switch processes BPDUs that are received, but it does not transmit BPDUs to the superior upstream switch"
 My understanding is that when BPDU filter is configured globally it applies to all portfast ports and if a port receives a BPDU it converts to a regular STP port. Applied at the interface and it basically stops the port from participating in STP. 
 I feel like it's just explaining regular STP operation but I'm confused by the wording.

Currently the network utilizes Auto QoS at the access switch level for the end users. It is recommended to mark the traffic DSCP AF41. I am not sure if Auto QoS will mark this traffic appropriately or if I need to create a custom class-map/policy-map. I need some clarification on this statement in the 9300 documentation
 " After auto-QoS is enabled, do not modify a policy map or aggregate policer that includes AutoQoS in its name. If you need to modify the policy map or aggregate policer, make a copy of it, and change the copied policy map or policer. To use the new policy map instead of the generated one, remove the generated policy map from the interface, and apply the new policy map. " - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9500/software/release/17-3/command_reference/b_173_9500_cr/qos_commands.htm
 So is this saying copy the Auto QoS policy and create a duplicate with my custom class-maps then disable Auto QoS and apply to the interface?
 I am very weak in this area, any help is much appreciative.

 we are a fairly large organization with a couple of small offices around the world.
 For example we have an office in Tokyo with approx a dozen users. We have a small vSphere platform there which we want to dismantle and go serverless. We have already two EC2 DCs in the AWS Frankfurt region (they are an extention of our on-prem AD).
 Something I'm wondering, we also have offices in Singapore, Manila, Seoul and a few more in the region. So I believe it may make sense to use a single region (Singapore ?) to serve all these regions ?
 I'm curious as to what kind of best practice analysis and implementation (if one exists) I should follow for this kind of implementation. Has anyone gone through this before ? Just trying to see if there is a known practice I should follow.
 Thanks in advance!

The connection once works and once does not work. I was able to determine that the public FQDN resolves to a lot of public IPs from different subnets. The ASA does not always have the IP address in the DNS cache to which the FQDN on the server was resolved. Server and the ASA have exactly the same DNS server set up. Unfortunately, I am unable to obtain a complete list of the IP addresses of the subnets to which the FQDN is resolved, so traffic needs to be filtered to FQDN. I have noticed that the FQDN on the server changes every 30-40 seconds or so, and on the ASA in the DNS cache I see a TTL for the FQDN of up to 2 minutes. Does anyone have any idea how to solve this so that in the DNS cache on the ASA the FQDN address is always the same as on the server? I know that the server first resolves the FQDN and then with the IP address it gets from DNS it goes to ASA. The ASA must have there the IP address to which the FQDN on the server was resolved.

 I’ve noticed with my work Dell, that when under heavy load, it drains from the battery as well as the mains. At first I thought there was something wrong with it, but apparently this is normal for modern laptops and makes sense as it saves on money for the manufacturer as they can use a weaker power supply and regulators. 
 In addition, I’ve noticed that if the battery dies completely, the laptop won’t switch back on for five or so minutes until the battery has charged a bit even though the power cable is plugged in - just like a flat phone…
 So is the battery now essential? I’m asking partly because I wonder what will happen to certain laptops in a few years once the battery is fully aged and useless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working with some network automation over the last while at my organization. The senior tech's haven't enabled HTTP on any of the network appliances because as far as they're concerned, it simply expands the attack surface to yet another port on the device when SSH, NETCONF, and SNMP are open. 
 I've been working with Python and Ansible to script some automated actions and generate reports for certain bits of data, but now I'm genuinely curious. 
 Ansible has the ability to utilize either netconf (XML via SSH), restapi (HTTP API), or network_cli (CLI via SSH) for its connection method to the devices. In the same vein, I can use Netmiko (CLI via SSH) or NAPALM (HTTP API) when using Python/Nornir.
 Our monitoring tools make extensive use of SNMP. This includes DNAC pushing downstream changes. 
 Q: What are the immediate benefits to enabling HTTP within the direct scope of network automation and API usage? Can it be reasonably boiled down to "aimlessly expanding the attack surface", or is there tangible benefit that I'm not seeing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing some weekend work for a second school district and I've been getting complaints about staff not being able to pull up certain videos falling under restricted. I have the staff OU set to be able to verify and approve restricted content and in chrome device policies I have restricted mode disabled for the staff OU as well.
 It works fine in Edge and when I pull the policies JSON it seems to be flagged as a machine policy override, but I can't seem to find a toggle for it, assuming it's some Chrome browser specific setting but I'm not finding anything under Chrome device policies.
  "ForceYouTubeRestrict": { "conflicts": [ { "level": "mandatory", "scope": "user", "source": "cloud", "value": 0 } ], "level": "mandatory", "scope": "machine", "source": "cloud", "value": 2, "warning": "This policy is working as intended but a conflicting value is set elsewhere and is overridden by this policy." }, 
 Any ideas?
 Edit: From what I can see it's doing at the level of the Chrome application as an HTTP header restriction to the individual machine/browser, going into a guest mode in the browser continues to apply the policy, and I can see the policy is being applied at the machine level in the admin console, but not where the policy is coming from...
 Edit: Changed machine policy at root level to allow, and at student level to disable, which resolved the issue. For some reason it was prioritizing/inheriting the root level machine policy instead of overriding it.

 Has anyone used the Cat8000 as an LNS? Are there any restrictions or caveats
 The router should be integrated as MPLS Edge with IS-IS, MPLS-SR and L3VPN. From the licensing point of view the Network Advantage stack gives all this. Has anyone already gathered experience with this?
 Up to now i never implemented a C8k as plain IOS-XE device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I describe the problem everyone will probably be happy to know that I've already told them to change the hostname of Device B and to never talk to be about this again. But I have a bug up my butt because I should be able to detect where this is coming from, but so far I can't.
 My company writes custom applications that create custom problems. Today's problem is that something is creating dynamic DNS entries on our DNS server on behalf of another device, and the DNS entry it is creating has an IP that conflicts with another device on the network.
 Device A is a Windows 10 PC with IP 192.168.1.100 and hostname Device-A. Device B is some embedded device with IP 192.168.1.200 and hostname Device-A. That's right, duplicate hostname. So the DNS entry for Device A gets over-written with the 192.168.1.200 address and then they can't reach Device A on the network.
 The problem is that it isn't Device B that is creating the entries on the DNS server. We turned Device B off for 24 hours and something still was creating the DNS entry, but I can't find what is doing that. I've run Wireshark captures, Microsoft Network Monitor captures, ProcMon captures, and checked the DNS-Server Audit log in Event Viewer. I can see plenty of entries of Active Directory dynamic updates, arp/LLMNR/NBNS/MDNS queries and responses, SMB advertisements, but none of them are for Device B that I'm looking for. 
 Clearly the problem is that I don't have a deep enough understanding of the mechanisms behind this behavior. So I'm hoping someone can throw some terms my way that I can Google and read up on. Or some articles that describe what's going on. I've been doing some Google searches but I'm only finding generic articles/tutorials that don't give any insight into what I'm looking for.
 Thanks in advance for any info you can send my way!
 Edit: Both devices have static IPs configured, no DHCP is involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 TL;DR: What are the real MFA triggers for Azure Security Defaults? Is it sufficient for SMB?
 Ages ago I read up on Azure security defaults (link on bottom), and it appeared to only register users for authentication methods, but it did not enforce MFA use for users, instead only admins. 
 Shortly after the announcement - it appeared that they added a "smart tracking" (per se) that would have users use MGA when it is necessary. 
 With that in mind, does anyone know the exact rules to when users will need to reauthenticate?
 Is this sufficient for SMBs (less than 30 users), or should I use per-user MFA/force upgrades to licensing for Conditional Access?
 I understand that there are many factors, but I would like to understand more in depth. Through testing, I have confirmed that new IPs trigger MFA, but I want to be sure that after some time it get's triggered again.

 Two Domain Controllers. Both 2016, say A and B. B is relatively new.
 Using our VPN appliance and AD authentication, if the VPN connects to A, it will allow users on, it will allow the users connect and read the users group membership.
 If A is down and B is up, the VPN will connect to B but return wrong credentials for the user 
 There's no error messages in DCdiag for both. Repadmin is fine.
 I can setup a user in AD, shut down DC A and can log the brand new user onto a new laptop and it will show their logon server is B.
 I have a ticket with the VPN vendor, but still feel something must be up with B. Just can't think of any troubleshooting. Any ideas? Or any way to test the user with flow or get logs?

However most guides talk about how you need to include all the users of the other tiers in the deny policy. For instance for the T0 GPO you need to deny T1 and T2 users.
 However, I wanted to reverse this logic. I would like to deny access to ALL users and exclude the current tier users only. Tried doing this by denying all authenticated users and changing the GPO's permission of "Apply group policy" to deny the GPO being applied to the T0 users. But, since the GPO is a computer policy it won't do much to deny users from the GPO. 
 Is there another way to handle this logic of having denied logon access to everyone except some group?

 What are the tools you must have with you at all times? I am pretty nomadic with my IT tool-set. I typically have my laptop backpack that contains all sorts of items. Some to share are:
 iFixIt screw drivers, rechargeable battery pack, Ethernet cables, HDMI cable, USB-C Hub with Ethernet adapter, USB drives. I have some other cables too and carry an inverter in my car. 
 What do you all keep with you? Or are must haves in your department?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked by my new job to implement some power apps governance.
 It looks like its been halfway setup 
 -we have a CoE environment
 -microsoft Flow is under the solutions
 -we have a service account as the creator of half the flows (other flows are the ex-employee that set it up a few months ago)
 -I cannot see any of the flows from the ex-employee, it errors out
 ​
 I do not think anything is actively running in the CoE environment. I ran an audit on the service account to see if its actually doing anything and nothing came up.
 I want to redo the entire environment, as it seems the CoE governance apps have updated since that time the user implemented it. It also was halfway finished, with some of the crucial flows belonging to the ex-employee that it used to belong to.
 ​
 That being said, has anyone ran into this or setup something similar? If I reset the password on the service account via AAD, will anything break? I need to log into it to set up our CoE environment from scratch as this current one is a mess.

 Has anyone had any experience with them? PayG is $5.99/month with no fees on egress/API requests, and it just seems so suspiciously cheap to me. 
 I intend to backup about 100GB of 365 data via object storage, and then a backup store via a scale out repo... We'll be well under 1TB, but still, 5.99 just seems ridiculous? I'm aware that deletion of anything younger than 90 days will result in a charge; that won't be an issue..

In the short term, I would like to get an entry level job as a linux sys admin after some time spent at the NOC, the end game maybe dive into Azure.
 Although my main focus is to set my self up for success after the NOC and get a job working as a sys admin. Which of the two certs would best help me achieve this ? LPIC 1 - 3 or LFCA ?

 I run Fedora 36 on my home PC and I've setup an Alma Linux 8 VM in work that I want to use as a jumpbox to access our systems however I also want all my special keystrokes to go to that VM like the Windows Key, Alt Tab, Ctrl-Shift-Tab etc....
 The connection to the office uses OpenVPN which I keep running in a terminal on my Desktop PC.
 I was thinking that using XDMCP over ssh would be the way to go by starting X in tty2 and connecting that to the VM but also keeping tty1(my current local XFCE4 DE) available to use by jumping between the two.
 Does this sound like a good idea?My aim is to maximize the performance but also for it to be stable. 
 For reference: My Fedora install makes no use of Wayland at all, it started as the absolute minimum install and I opted for X. The reason being that I wanted to try building up the system only with packages I needed as I went along.

 I’ve seen quite a few companies in which majority of the infrastructure is hosted in AWS but are still utilizing services from Microsoft such as Intune, Office 365 suite, AD connect, etc. The companies I work with traditionally have only Windows Servers along with a few custom apps their developers manage and maintain. To me, it seems more rational to host everything in Azure instead of splitting services out between the two platforms. Any ideas on the rational here?
 Edit: I’m aware that there may be cost difference and such but from my experience, Azure and AWS seem fairly similar in regards to pricing and data center locations.

 We had been using a particular piece of software for phishing simulation exercises for 4 years, but when Microsoft introduced their own version of campaigns within 365 admin centre I decided to use that, and not renew the paid product. 
 So, when the renewal hit my inbox some 2 months before the current licence term was up, I told them that I we did not wish to renew. 
 However, they insisted that we were under contract as we hadn’t given them 3 months notice to cancel. I tried speaking to the account manager and even to their legal dept, but they insisted that we pay. I tried to negotiate a smaller termination fee based on us not using it for around 18 months but they wouldn’t budge and finance eventually paid after I had it in writing that it would not auto renew next year. 
 I just found the whole experience really shitty customer service from them and would never recommend them or a company that operates the same.
 //edit. Since a few have asked. The company in question is Metacompliance

 This is maddening for me and anxiety enducing. I had three tasks in 1 hour to do, had about 10-15 each to do them. The first was to write a docker container to make a small python game work. I did it but not the exact way they wanted with the container using CMD to launch the game itself. This wasn't for lack of knowledge, this was how my mind functions, I write what feels like it should work, test, iterate, troubleshoot, test, etc. In the end it worked but I had to exec into the container to manually run it. 5 minutes longer or someone not watching me…]]></summary>

 looking up the parts online through the partner reseller websites, it doesn't note what's in the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just going to go on a little rant here, so pardon my french, but for the love of god and all that is holy, please name your servers, your network infrastructure, hell even your datacenters something logical. 
 So far, in my travails, I have encountered naming conventions centered around:
  
Comic book characters
 Greek/Norse mythology
 Capitals
 Painters
 Biblical characters
 Musical terminology (things like "Crescendo" and "Modulation")
 Types of rock (think "Graphite" and "Gneiss")
  
This isn't the Da Vinci code, you're not adding "depth" by dropping obscure references in your environment. When my external consultant ass walks into your office, it's to help you with your problems. I'm not here to decipher three layers of bullshit to figure out what you mean by saying your Pikachu can't connect to your Charizard because Snorlax is down. Obtuse naming conventions like this cost time, focus and therefor money. I get that it adds a little flair to something sterile and "dull", but it's also actively hindering me from doing a good job. 
 Now, as a disclaimer, what you do in the privacy of your own home is not my business. If you want to name your server farm after the Bad Dragon catalog, be my guest, you're the god of your domain. But if you're setting up an environment to be maintained by a dozen or so people, you have to understand that not everyone will hear "Chance" and think "Domain Controller".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The company I'm working for is an ISP owning a small fibre network. We use GPON to rent internet accesses to private customers. As we are expanding our network we need to automate the provisioning of the devices to keep up with the workload.
 I've created a small proof of concept using netbox as a single source of truth and Ansible running on AWX as our automation controller. This is suboptimal as there is no Ansible role/collection for the Nokia ISAM FD series. Developing one would mean substantial costs in allocated engineering time.
 Before commiting to this model I'd like to know what automation concepts you folks use in your networks. Have you got multi / single vendor concepts, what software do you use, how do you handle (legacy) devices which are not supported by the automation software? Do you use monolithic or vendor specific solutions or do you use a stack of different solutions communicating by API? If possible please put the model in context of how many devices are automated, and how large the supporting team is. 
 Many thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am looking for a best bang-for-buck solution - be it refurbished or otherwise - of a server for the following uses.
 It can hold hyper-v with 3 x VM's. 
 A VM for "us" so basically a jumpbox for our techs to work from (want DC access only when absolutely necessary).
 A VM for basic file backups (to supplement our cloud solution)
 A VM for testing - so if we want to test a login before handing it out, we have a prebuilt vm to test login etc.
 That's all, and none of them have to run super speedy or anything.
 Finally, it must be low footprint, to fit into a locked cabinet. It can either be small or a rack mounted item.
 I've literally never used a mini server... so not sure what might fit these needs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have been wanting to do this for a long time, One of the things that I am really passionate about is using a data driven approach to save money on Cloud spend. The most rewarding jobs I have undertaken in the past are going into an AWS environment and saving money on cloud spend and optimising the best performance for less money! 
 It's a great value add for any organisation. 
 Alot of the organisations spend more on fancy tools to try and save money on Monthly cloud spend which I think is pointless as it often outweighs the cost of the money they try and save. Also I have seen tools that don't even check the basics. The data is already there for you in AWS and it's simply a case of extrapolating it using a bit of engineering time which you pay for anyway and the result is that you can often save more money! 
 Certainly I have seen it a lot here in Reddit, Cost is becoming ever more prevalent in many AWS environments. 
 Two things to mention, There are copies I will give away for free to those engineers who will agree to read it and implement the savings ideas in their environments and give me feedback and comments, So it would be good to see how much you saved over a month. It would be interesting to gauge feedback. 
 I have to spend a bit of time mentoring Juniors in the past so I know especially at the moment how the job market is. So I will give away free copies to Junior engineers looking for ideas how to break into the market and some handy tips to increase your chances of standing out when going to for an interview. 
 If you feel this is you, Feel free to DM me. 
 Anyway without giving too much away, I have produced a guide for it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. Good day!
 So, I was planning to take off the password on my laptop because my brother will use it so he will not call me every time. I dont know what I did but I managed to change my only account on the laptop to local guest user from administrator. Now, there are things that I cannot access becuase it says it needs the approval of admin.
 Usually there will be a prompt like, "Do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device" and it has an option of "Yes" or "No", but since there is no admin now, it only has "No".
 I'm stupid I know (lol) but i dont know what to do. hahaha. Highly appreciate it if somebody can suggest what I need to do. Thank you :)
 edit: I have the windows 11 now

 I have just done an audit of local accounts on servers and noticed a jdkadmin account on one. Appears to be a full admin on the server.
 Doing a google it could be a java account. According to logging, the jdkadmin account has been there for a few days. This server has an internal only web app on it so could be java related. Also has Firefox on it and Chrome. External access is via reverse proxy in Azure.
 As a precaution, I have changed all domain admin accounts, audited the admin usage accounts, and changed all 30-odd service accounts. Also changed the ADMINISTRATOR accounts and made sure it hasn't been used. Also revoked all VPN credentials from third-party support companies and suspended all their accounts just in case.

 We have 802.1X enabled and I’ve read that you shouldn’t use that together with MAC port-security since it may cause other issues.
 What is the best and simplest way to get rid of unmanaged switches that doesn’t talk STP?
 Might I add, we use Catalyst 9200/9300 mainly with some 2960x here and there.

 Hard decision has to be made -
 Should we buy $1,000 desktops + $1,000 laptops? or forget the desktops and spend the full $2,000 on laptops with docking stations and use it like a desktop with employees taking it home when needed.
 The desktop+laptop option seems enticing but having twice the equipment to keep track of, maintain, keeping track of files on two devices... could get messy, at least compared to just having the simplicity of one laptop for everyone.
 We're looking to get 5 years out of the equipment. What would your preferred set up be for work if you had the option? what makes the most sense? Are surface pros with docks worth considering?

 There are two sets of switches. 
 One set of switches has multimode transceivers with duplex multimode patch cables plugging into the fiber patch panel at each end on pair 1. 
 The other set of switches are using single mode transceivers with duplex single mode patch cables and plugged into the same patch panel using pair 2. 
 I can confirm that they are from the same cable. (6 wires that make 3 pairs). 
 Both setups work. How is that possible running over the same type of fibre? Assuming the fibre in between the patch panels is single mode, then multimode should not work or vice versa correct?
 Thanks.

Like "check if AV is working by trying to download EICAR test file" or "check if Port X,Y,Z are generally closed towards internet by trying to connect to destinations that would generally allow those ports" etc.
 I don't know if I'm googling the correct terms, as I couldn't find any good resources on this topic.
 My first idea was setting up nagios or librenms or something and just use active checks for this. Curling EICAR test file or setting up tcp checks for certain ports / destinations and stuff.
 Am I on the right track for this? Is there dedicated software for this purpose?

My problem is the ISP on my main router is pretty crappy and has outages all the time. I would like to utilize the 1GB on my 2nd router for failover. I figured there must be a way to configure the lan port on the pfsense router to be able to utilize the circuit on the main router. Any ideas on how i should proceed with this configuration? vlans, bridge mode,??? help please!

looks more Mac like and that is a positive thing 
 snap layouts are super useful
 people are actually using virtual desktops (I did bill virtual desktops as a “new feature” even though it was in windows 10) 
 the simplified interface on the surface seems more intuitive 
 the learning curve is very shallow since most conventions from 10 carried over
 new context menu missing buttons is a sticking point 
  
For the most part feedback has been positive. I haven’t received any hate for bringing things from 10 > 11, when I did receive some hatemail last time upgrading people from 7 > 10. Totally anecdotal, but thought the upgrade being relatively easy on end users was notable.

Client network isolation based on student account for IOT devices (Clearpass AirGroups)

It looks like Aruba can do both, if you have both Clearpass and Aruba APs. Cisco can do both with ISE and Cisco APs, but I'm having a hard time finding a documented solution with both vendors. 
 I did find this Aruba doc showing iPSK setup in Clearpass, but I'm not sure how the policy is enforced on the WLC side or if you can dynamically setup PSK's on a per account basis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our director of 15 years is retiring soon. This person hired me years ago. She has been a great director - doesn't micromanage, tons of flexibility, plays the politics well, and buffers us from users / admin if necessary. We are a small dept. and everyone gets along. Sure there are things I would change but overall no major complaints.
 Everyone's a little spooked that we will get someone with a bunch of accolades in here that don't know what they are doing, or starts micromanaging way more than they need to. Truth be told we do need a little more accountability and more focused job descriptions - but just a little...
 In the end its probably out of our hands and we just continue to do what we do, but who has been through this and are there any ways to prepare? Obviously we all want to "appear" to have our shit together for a new boss. Some of us don't really care we been doing it long enough though.

 After a brief chat to a contact at a local uni in the same city, who was setting up a 10gb link between buildings with dark fibre, it got me wondering if I am doing it all wrong!! :)
 So it's just a general question to you my peers, what would you expect to pay to connect 2 buildings a couple of miles apart?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm helping setup a new network at a local church. They are using all Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment for firewall, switch, Wifi, etc. I'm wondering what others recommend for how to handle a Guest network.
 People will come in every weekend for a service and we want to have wifi available. Device Isolation and bandwidth throttling will definitely be enabled regardless of the options below. I've come up with 3 options for handling the Guest access:
  
Portal - Unifi has a portal available where you have to tap "I Agree" in order to use wifi. This does not require a password of any kind, which is nice, but some devices don't play well with those type of portals
 WPA Key - We could print a passcode on a sign and post them around the building (it's a small building). People enter that and get on the wifi. Pretty straight forward. Could change the password every once in a while if needed.
 Open - No password, no portal, just join and away you go. Most user friendly but least secure.
  
Just curious what others do, or would do, in a situation like this.
 Thank!

 So, I chat with NewEgg to try and resolve the issue...I'm quickly told the message refers to NewEgg's website neweggbusiness.com and that I would have to place the order there, and they supplied a link to the account application page. 
 I asked our accounting person to complete the application to establish the account. Next day, I have my new login to neweggbusiness.com.
 Off I go to shop for my needed M.2 cards...huh, uh, but wait...now the pricing is different, the vendors are different, delivery is a 30 day window? WTF????
 After explaining this to my supervisor, who reports to the owner of the company who despises Amazon, I et permission to use Amazon. I head off to Amazon, where there is no limit, $50 each cheaper, and they will be here Monday...

 My question is: Why do they use these random-looking filenames vs. a standard updater that I could allow once? Is this kind of like password rotation but with executable rotation, to prevent people from being too trusting of any one updater? Might it not backfire in a similar fashion, with people getting used to allowing things to dial out from the temp directory?

 I recently jumped from a 'generalist' sysadmin position to a more specified role within the same organization.
 The generalist position was within a niche part of the org with a small team/little documentation/complex environment. 
 My old boss is requesting I perform both job duties. His words on my replacement "we don't have one we will just wing it." New boss is aware of the requests. He's already looking out for me, wants to make sure old boss does not take advantage of me. These requests were NOT on the offer letter I signed regarding the promotion.
 I respect my old boss, I respect my old small team, I don't want to leave them high and dry... but I'm also excited to move into this specialized role, and I need to spend some time getting up to speed to perform... and honestly, I'm just done with the generalist life, I want to move on, close that chapter.
 Any advice on how I go about this?

 Both modules are green and have a status of "ok." The 10/40 gbps module's interfaces came up and I allocated all except one to the proper VDCs; however, the 1/10 module's interfaces do not show in the management VDC or the production VDCs that they were originally assigned to.
 The second issue is that on the 10/40 card, interface 7 unlike the other interfaces on the card, is broken down into subinterfaces eth1/7/1 - eth1/7/4. Eth1/7/1 does not appear when I do a "show interface status" and when I try to allocate the other three subinterfaces to a VDC I get this error "Port allocate not supported on this interface!"
 Does anybody have an idea of what the cause of these issues are?

 My question is this, though. What qualifies someone as a Senior Network Engineer? Is it just a title? Is it professional level certifications? Is it years of experience?
 ​
 I know this is a very weighted question and will vary based on opinion, but I'm interested in everyone's opinions. At what point do I know that I've achieved my goal? I'm a life-long learner and will continue to grow, but I have to have reasonable, attainable goals (short-term, long-term, or otherwise). Without them being reasonable/attainable they will forever hang above me like a badge of dishonor and no one wants that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I have a topic to get my head around. We´re a small company - not going into details here - going heavy on SQL servers. By now, we have a small on premise infrastructure (4 Hyper-V hosts) which I wanna bring towards Azure in the future. While I plan the migration, I also want to enhance our daylie routines, workflows and such. The network is/was a mess when I took over.
 Back to the topic:
 Our users require access to MSSQL, create/restore backups and make changes to different databases (I want them to be able to spin up their own databases according to their needs). For now, they install MSSQL Server XXXX locally and use a per-core license, which is working completely fine. My problem: I´m sure the licensing is not correct, so I see urgent need to change this.
 My assumtions there is no difference between licensing SQL Server (Per-Core) on a server system or a client system. 
 So my idea was to spin up SQL servers (Dev, Test, Pdroc) with 100% correct licensing, give users access to it with permissions as needed and ban the locally installed SQL servers completely. Any thoughts on this? How are you guys handleing it if the Express edition is not an option due to the restrictions? 
 Thanks for your ideas, have a great weekend!

I checked what wifi us available around me and it appeared as one. The router on the top is connected to the ISP and the ones on the botton floor are connected to the main router with ethernet cable. Why isnt there 3 networks?

 In Azure Active Directory, I would like to change the state of my computers from Azure Registered to Hybrid AD Join.
 As mentioned by Microsoft, we have to use ADConnect to apply this task.
 (In my case, i am using an ADFS server to authenticate our users in different apps and my target (in the future) is to avoid ADFS server to authenticate...)
 ADConnect give us the choice between Federated or Managed domain.
 Even I am using ADFS, can I choose Managed Domain to "Hybrid AD JOIN" my computers???
 ​
 Thanks for your advices.

 I don't know why on my wsus kb5015684 (W10 22H2 insider pre release) had been approved instead of "insider" not checked on the Products.
 Now my problem is my computers are on W10 22H2 and can't get the kb5018410 who patch 0-day vulerabilities. Because no kb5018410 for Windows 10 22H2
 Have you an idea to solve this or when Microsoft plan to release officially 22H2 ?

I'm in a good place, mostly...I have new firewalls, new switches (assuming they ever show up), we do yearly pen tests, utilize SpecOps, are working on rolling out SSO, have an Exchange Online migration in place, ect.
 ​
 I was thinking about things like ZScaler (I still need to look into it) and looking for a DNS service, but beyond that, I'm having trouble coming up with things, so I though I'd see what others are planning on doing.
 ​
 EDIT: We have an MDM, ticketing is outside my sphere of influence, but yeah, we do need to improve that too.

I joined about a month ago and I have been mostly learning about the infrastructure system here. I am part of a Security Services Department, which mean we provide Cyber Security solution to other enterprise and my team deals with all the infrastructure devices to ensure the connection works. Our department used many different types of hardwares and softwares. My supervisor is quite busy and doesnt have much time for me.Over my time here so far, my team has been mainly dealing with patch update and migration. Since I think I have gotten the hang on the things here, I want to try and initate areas of improvement and make an impact here. 
 I can share some of the hardware and software we used. VPN: Pulse Secure Firewall: SRX345 Backup:Datadomain AAA: Cisco ACS(Upgrading to ISE soon) Management: Servicenow, BigFix
 Other than those I mentioned above, we have also others like palo alto, fortinet , solarwinds , Vmware and I can share more info if you need more with confidentialty of course. 
 Looking for suggestions on areas I can focus on where I can you know help save time/save costs/save manpower. Thanks you so much!

 I think it would be an amazing oppurtunity, but I’m also scared that it’s a lot of responsibility and I’m not really sure how people at non-ISPs react to people working ”at the root of it all” as it were. 
 So in short, do you consider it just another IT vendor, or is there anything in particular I should know about the ISP industry?

 However I've also tested and it all seems to work with no issues at all so I'm confused. Is it a case that it used to require full desktop client licences and no longer does?

 I originally had 2 domain controllers in my environment, DC and DC2. DC is currently not functioning, the desktop environment doesn't load and a bunch of services are crapping out.
 I moved all FSMO roles successfully from DC to DC2 so now DC2 is the master. I spun up a new DC3, and want to remove DC from the environment by demotion.
 This is the error I am receiving when trying to demote via Server Manager on either DC2/DC3: https://imgur.com/a/Kwoswwv
 Because I cannot log into DC and demote from itself, I'm doing it from the other domain controller's Server Manager by adding the server and removing the AD role / DNS role that way.
 Any idea what this error means and why it is showing up? If there is no way of cleanly removing from the environment, does anyone have a document on how to manually remove and clean up from the domain?
 Thanks in advance.

That time i probably overreacted and used some choice language, explained that I was very busy and the proper channels he should be using (which he knows but chose to ignore). Anyway, just wondering if it happened to anyone else. Felling a bit bad as I overreacted a bit but was very busy on 3-4 other things at the time

 I have a very strange "issue" on new machines after they have been imaged using our SCCM task sequence build. So I do apologize if this doesn't make much sense... it isn't very clear for me either.
 When you reboot or turn on these new built machines the device tries to automatically log in to an account and says password incorrect. I can't see this account referenced anywhere in the sccm task sequence and i have no idea why its trying to log into this account when the device turns on...
 Is there any way to control this via a task sequence? When a user turns on the machine, I want the log in screen showing only options for the previous logged in user and "Other User".
 Any advice its really stumping me...

 Recently we started building up our secondary domain here at this school for just our department. Background is that we wanna use VMware Horizon and everyone else doesn't. And with "we" I mean "my boss". 
 Anyhow, we set up a new domain (first time for me going away from open source/linux), got a trust with the main domain. unidirective, transitive. Beacuse of privacy laws and whatnot the users will reside on the remote AD, but they are supposed to log in in our domain.
 This is all fine and dandy, everything works alright, except one thing that I have no idea how to replicate:
 The main domain is called something like domain1.school.int but they log in with [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int)
 now our domain is also underneath school.int like this: domain2.it.school.int 
 I want to be able to login with the same [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int) that they can in their domain, all that works now is domain1\Username or [user@domain1.school.int](mailto:user@domain1.school.int) 
 what exactly am i looking for to do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We require a CAA record. We use Sectigo, so I assume our records will look something like this (as per the Sectigo FAQ):
 0 issue "sectigo.com"
 0 issuewild "sectigo.com"
 I'm not entirely sure if Sectigo wants these 2 records or just one of them; their FAQ is a bit vague? Input much appreciated.
 Is there anything else I should keep in mind adding these records?
  
I understand this record only affects the renewal or newly issued certificates, so no matter how much we'd fuck this record up right now, our sites won't be affected as of today, have I correctly understood this? This is crucial - Our certificates are present in a lot of places, so it'd, frankly, be an absolute disaster if these records could negatively impact the sites today.
 Are there any other advice or tips you could give me that I should keep in mind?
 Thank you so very much!

 First time here, newbie on networking problems.
 I'm having problems to make an ssh connection from my host machine (ubuntu 22.04) and my virtual machine in Gnome Boxes (Ubuntu server 20.04). After failing to succeed, I relied on the following guide: https://bytefreaks.net/gnulinux/an-easy-way-to-ssh-into-a-gnome-boxes-os, with which I was able to open the ssh tunnel.
 The problem is that currently, I don't know for what reason, the method no longer works and fails me in a generic: "Network unreachable" error. Do you have any idea why? Also do you know if there is a better way to connect me from host to guest using gnome boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I'm pretty new in the sysadmin world, currently undergoing my training. My first year or something is in the endpoint management/helpdesk team.
 Atm I'm taking care of setting up new notebooks for users. Here's a short description of the workflow:
 Supervisor sends hardware request - > I send out a premade mail requesting info about software the user needs - > I install the software and set up their HCL Notes - > hand out to user
 Now the issue is that the mail that I send out also asks for the user's Windows and Notes passwords. Every cybersecurity workshop will tell users that their sysadmin will NEVER ask for their password (which is totally correct, right?)
 Obviously we'd somehow get into their accounts anyway so handing out the passwords doesn't really change anything, it just feels wrong I guess? And it probably actually is. 
 We need the passwords for a few minor settings in Notes and that's it. I asked my colleagues about it and they answered it with concerns that if users did these settings by themselves they'd scew it up and we'd get more tickets.
 My point of view is that I think that this could be done by the users with a well made tutorial.
 I've been getting more and more confused/negative answers towards the password mails that I sent out so it's also a personal issue because I don't want to answer a mail like "Yes you are totally right, however...". 
 How do handle this at work and how could I change this situation for the better? Thank you for your answers in advance :).

 I would like to hear what your recommendations and experience of syslog servers are?
 I’m currently running Kiwi Syslog Server but I’m not very found of it so I’m considering changing it for something better. I feel like I’m missing some nice report features.
 Cloud or on prem, free or paid does not matter much. (As long as it is not too expensive)
 I would like to be able to do the basic things like setting up e-mail alerts, analyze logs, etc. I should also be able to set up alerts based on priority, keywords and more.
 I’m currently picking up logs from firewalls, switches, network thermometers, UPSes and more. Less than 100 devices I think.
 So, what are you using and are you pleased with it?

 I guess you could say like a lot of people I have experience in O365, your general Azure resources with very small VM hosted xp, SharePoint, Cloud backups, Physical Networking/Firewalls/Switches, Desktop and Server support.
 What concerns me is on paper it can look like I have a lot of experience, Networking is definitely not my strongest point, but I know all the fundamentals to manage an enterprise network and in general what best practices are. Can I troubleshoot a moderate Networking issue? probably not if it's outside general vlan/firewall traffic rules. If you were to put a Cisco switch Infront of me, can I configure it via CLI? Absolutely not without spending a few good hours googling. I've been spoilt by the luxury of using Meraki and how easy everything is to configure and manage on the GUI that I'm afraid my next gig will be expecting way too highly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this process is to give the CPU something to execute in case there is nothing else to do (thus it is called idle ;-). Let’s think about the next situation, we have a process using 30% of CPU, in that case PID 0 (System Idle) will consume the remaining 70%. Also, Idle is the first process that the kernel starts. Moreover, there is a kernel thread of System Idle for each vCPU the OS has identified .
 The reason for having an “Idle Process” is to avoid an edge case in which the scheduler (Windows schedule based on threads) does not have any thread in a “Ready” state to execute next. By the way, there are also other schedulers IO and Memory, which we will talk about in one of the next posts/writeups.
 When the kernel threads are executed they can also perform different power saving tricks regarding the CPU. One of them could be halting different components which are not in use until the next interrupt arrives. The kernel threads can also call functions in the HAL (hardware abstraction layer, more on that in the future) in order to perform tasks such as reducing the CPU clock speed. Which optimization is performed is based on the version of Windows, hardware and the firmware installed.

 We now would like the company.local admins to have access to the company.public AD, just to avoid having multiple credentials as admins. 
 As AD Federation, as I see it, only needs port 80/443 this seems to me the safest way to implement this without "really" connecting the two AD domains (as we really don't want to have them seeing each other).

Ultimately we want to make it so that users can only login with a Yubikey and they won’t have a password at all. In Windows there is no way to disable the username/password login. So I figured we could just change everyone’s password and then just not give the password to them unless they need it for RDP or to setup their Microsoft 365 account on their work phone.
 So my question is, is their a tool that can do this, or can we change every password using PowerShell?

 We have Always on VPN. Deployed as Per the Richard Hicks Book. Works Great. 
 I am deploying the User VPN and Device Tunnels using Intune
 99% of the time the User VPN works and connects Automatically but the Device Tunnel never connects before the login screen. 
 Was hoping to have the device tunnel connect before login incase the user on the computer changes (EG at a site with no DC connectivity)
 I have a Windows 10 Computer. Works fine. Windows 11 won't connect unless I do it manually
 We also have the issue in Intune where it says it failed to deploy but I can see both tunnels on the machine.
 Sort of annoying as I like Direct Access and it was connected when the computer got internet.

 I have been trying to do some research in regards to switch daisy chaining and unfortunately I have been getting a lot of conflicting answers and I am reaching out to see if anyone here as any experience in regards to this.
 I am working on a property that has appx 20 buildings and we have connected each building together via cat6 cable and network switches.
 However it seems like some devices, specifically the devices on the end of the chain not all but some are having connection issues. I did notice some high ms when i ping the devices around 300 - 800. I was told that every switch kind of relights the signal and that I shouldn't be having any issues. It seems like when i try to access the devices web gui it can take several minutes to load. We have appx 30 switches on this chain.
 Any info would be appreciated it.
 ​
 Hope someone can help me out!
 ​
 Thanks
 ​
 Here is some more details.
 Switches are 5 Port or 8 Port Gigabit POE SwitchesDevices - Hikvision Cameras 10/100 POE
 The switches are daisy chained one to the next to the next etc
 CAT6 Cable between the longest switch is less than 100m.

 I have ~2 years of generic sysadmin experience. I got an engineer role centered around power platforms / teams / 365 / exchange (on prem and cloud) around two months ago. I was administering 365 previously and had exchange online experience but no real exchange experience (patching, migrating on prem to 365 and dealing with all that).
 ​
 I feel pretty lost every day, I feel underqualified for this position and am hoping I can fake it until I make it.
 Lately Ive been tasked with automating governance with our power apps platform (Making a CoE environment group that purges inactive groups, sends emails to groups that never had apps/flows made etc). I've zero experience in power apps in general and even after a couple days of learning etc I still feel utterly clueless. For instance, I cannot figure out how to see what the contents are of an orphaned flow, when I share I just get an error about sharing to myself to see what was in the solution flow (which apparently only exists with these).
 ​
 I suppose I'm just seeing if anyone was ever in my situation (went from generic admin to a specialized engineer role) and had success with it. I've feel I'm a pretty competent individual but my God, I have never had job this difficult before. Truly night and day from what I used to do.

 Dell N3200 switches start at $7700. What else is likely to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using a Windows machine with an onboard NIC and a USB adapter NIC. One connected to a static, public IP and the other to the private lan. Right now if i search what is my public IP it is giving me the public IP that belongs to the private lan, which by way of an ACL or something does not allow external incoming connections. This was something I was told by the managed networks services team. 
 I manually configured the interface metrics in each of the adapter's properties to 10 and 20, with the lower one configured on the adapter I want the public IP to actually be. When I disable the private lan adapter the appropriate public ip is displayed but as soon as I enable, the wrong public IP is back.
 Any thoughts on what I am overlooking here? This used to work but we did some cable management and now it's not working. All of the physical connections are the same as before.

        <updated>2022-10-13T18:45:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 I'm setting up a business 10GbE internal network using a Synology DS1821+ with (8) 16TB 7200 Seagate EXOS drives and two 10GbE RJ45 ports in the rear. This is for a video production company that wants the maximum data throughput to their devices since they frequently edit 4k 120fps uncompressed footage. My plan is to run both 10GbE ports from the Synology to a QNAP QSW M1208-8C through RJ45 to SFP+ adapters, then connect my 8 users to the switch through the remaining (8) RJ-45 ports with Cat6 Cable (all less than 75 foot runs). Additionally, I was planning to connect their modem to the switch using a 1GbE RJ45 to SFP adapter since their current internet speeds are 500/500. 
 My current issue is that I can't find a compatible 10GbE or 1GbE adapter that QNAP lists as compatible with the network switch. Would a generic adapter from FS suffice? Is compatibility required?
 My second issue is future expandability. With the NAS and the internet modem taking up of the (3) SFP ports using adapters, the remaining (8) RJ45/SPF combo 10GbE ports are taken up by the (8) users with RJ45 CAT6 cables. Would the smartest move when it's time to expand be to daisy-chain another switch in through the SFP port? Or purchase a new switch that has more ports?
 My third question is regarding bottlenecks. In each of the computers we have PCIE network cards that are rated for at least 5GbE, most 10GbE. Will our bottleneck be the computer connection or the speed of the Synology in RAID 6? Either way we should have plenty of bandwidth for editing 4k/120fps uncompressed, but I want to be getting the maximum throughput possible out of this system. 
 Thanks so much in advance.

Any time I visit this company he stops me to see if "there's anything you can do to make it faster". At this point Im just at a loss. The computer isnt especially slow, but the user will not accept 'Have less programs open at once' as a solution.

        <updated>2022-10-13T16:49:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a customer that purchased a Layer 2 circuit to connect their remote branch with the main office. Currently, each office has a unique subnet, which is managed by a SonicWALL device at each location. The customer isn't very tech/network savvy, but I've only really dealt with Layer 3 (networking support is more of a side-service our company provides), so I've not had experience trying to connect things over Layer 2. 
 My understanding (forgive me for my ignorance) is that Layer 2 only deals with MAC addresses, so it doesn't know how to route anything to do with Layer 3 (e.g. IP addresses). 
 Per the Layer 2 vendor, we connected the SonicWALLs to the designated ports on the Layer 2 appliances they installed at each location, but I haven't been able to figure out the appropriate configuration to get the two subnets to talk to each other, if that's even possible.
 Here's a rudimentary diagram of how things are currently connected; basically each SonicWALL is connected to the vendor-provided appliance
 Subnet 192.168.10.0/24 SonicWALL A (Port X2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | SonicWALL B (Port X3) Subnet 192.168.12.0/24 
 Since the subnets are separate, I tried setting up a static route on each SonicWALL so that traffic bound for the other office's subnet use the interface that's connected to the Layer 2 devices rather than the default gateway, but it doesn't seem to get through.
 I can try to provide additional information if that would be helpful; I'm just uncertain of what would be relevant here.
 Many thanks for any insight and apologies for my unfamiliarity with this stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So essentially, I'm setting up a network for a client and my boss wants to see if there's a way to setup a VPN before we install the network on site. We do support post-install so we just need a simple VPN to be able to access the network equipment if need be. The site is across the country, so we want to get as much done off-site to save money travelling, hence why we'd like the VPN setup before install. The issue being that we don't know what the broadcast IP of the network will be until we actually go and install it. 
 Is there any way to setup this VPN to connect in a different method? Or does it need to know the target network's broadcast IP to connect?
 VPN setup for remote access isn't something I'm super familiar with so sorry if this is a dumb question/wrong place for it.

 Here's the situation..
 HP C7000 Blade chassis with dual Flex-10 modules. Each module has 2 connections coming out. One goes to one top of rack extreme switch and the other to a secondary extreme switch. The Flex-10 is configured to use both.
 One of the Extreme switches decided to malfunction but not go down hard. So, the Flex-10 still thinks it's there and therefore continues to try and use it (and fails). My guys had to go into the Flex-10 and redirect it all to go to the secondary switch, restart the malfunctioning switch at a remote data center and then go back into the Flex-10 and put it all back. This takes a lot of time and does not help my SLA's.
 I find it hard to get my head around that in 2022, we don't have anything that can determine health of the network traffic beyond a heartbeat. Is there anything out there that you all know of that would work better? I have to have 99.99% uptime so whatever improvements I need to make, I need to do that.

It is my finding that Graph (perhaps just the powershell module, I don't know as I haven't yet started to work directly with the API) is likely the most unreliable system I have ever had the pleasure of using.
 - Every single time I load the module it takes different amounts of time to just do that
 - Switching to the beta profile might take a second, a minute or multiple minutes
 - Running Get-MGUser on a larger dataset might finish, it might not, if it does it might take one minute or it might take twenty minutes. When it fails VSCode just reports the connection was aborted.
 Graph has been around since what, 2019? I haven't talked to a single person that had positive things to say about it at this point. Is this the normal experience with graph? Or is it just the powershell module?

I was wondering if I could install it on a VM that I can give them all access to that would be on the same network as the DC. 
 From what I'm reading off google it has to be implemented on the DC in order to work but just wanted to make sure. Anyone have thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background : we have some Excel files that are probably 15+years old that people just keep updating through different office iterations. Some are to the point where they throw tons of errors any time they open it. I know myself and others in IT have spent countless hours doing our best to assist. Microsoft has said that different Office versions can change formulas or other variables and that likely is where the errors come from. I’ve tried explaining this to the end users that they will need to address the files themselves (fix or recreate. But it seems like quarterly or annually when they need to access some of these problem files the end users keep coming to IT with the same issue that we don’t have the tools, or time to address for what is ultimately an end-user problem.
 So in a broader sense how do you politely tell end-users that the problem they’re having is one that is their responsibility to fix, not IT’s?

 So by years end my job title and role in the company I work for will be changing. I am going from network support engineer to technology project lead. I work for a property management company so we have a lot of turn over as far as properties go. 
 I have been tasked with trying to find a tool or way to better organization the entire process from start to finish of taking on and transitioning away a property. My side of things is still heavy on the network and voip aspect of it all. It would be great if it had sharepoint integration but a big plus for me would be the ability for the rest of our small IT department to look through it when needed. Main focus would be tracking contacts and network information.

Most inkjects are garbage that's to be expected, but I have never seen printers in my life with this level of disconnections, software/hardware bugs, privacy intrusion, etc. The worst is I cannot even TURN OFF WSD on these F&$($ printers! 
 The nature of the business we have most employees working out of third party clinics or from home, so they usually purchase their own printers or the clinics will purchase these crappy things for the staff to use, and it has been an absolute nightmare.
 Don't get me started with the printer models ending with the -e, where you can't set up wifi or even print from the device until you create a stupid ass HP account. I don't encounter even 1/4 of these type of issues with inkjects from manufacturers like Brother or Canon, it's always the crappy HP printers.

 i am currently enrolled in learning programming and one of our recent topics is basic network/-ing.
 So our vm broke down and currently won't be fixed until the end of this course and we're all learning from home.
 I read that thread https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/2r5mgn/best_way_to_learn_networking/ but since it's 8 years old, i want to make sure that maybe some newer stuff is available.
 Long story short, is there any way for me to virtualise or emulate a "basic" network and configure virtual router/switches/vlan and so on?
 Should i install linux on a 2nd pc or rather emulate on my 1st.
 I would be grateful for any guidance, tips, books, youtube whatever.

 Thanks and cheers!

I logged into my account today and after receiving my 2fa from number 122395, I received another from 1-855-909-0331. Hmmmm. Now I am trying to figure out who is at fault here. How did a 3rd party know I just logged into NS in order to send me a fake auth code and how did they know my number? Does NS have a breach? Cant be my phone vendor, for I logged in from a laptop. If traffic was sniffed on my network or pc, there wouldnt be anyway to see the phone number. NS tier1 support didnt know what I was talking about and escalated the case. Hope to get an email from support soon. 
 If anyone reading this could log into their NS account to see if the same thing happens and share your feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.
 Side Thought: Why is NS still using SMS for authentication. They have been around a long time. Would be nice if I could use my Yubikey or even an Authentication App.

 📷
 About a year ago I created a pretty foolproof way to have a shared Service Account that would still require MFA in the cloud, using some Azure Automation and run as accounts. Not keeping up on upcoming changes I see Run As accounts are no longer an option and am trying to adjust my Script to use the managed Identity that is created with the Automation resource. The way it worked before was the Run as Account would get a few permissions once it was created the App Reg would get
  
Application Permissions
 Select User.ReadWrite. All
 GroupMember.ReadWrite. All
 Delegated Permissions
 User.ReadWrite
  
It would also get User Admin RBAC role. All of these permission were needed to change the password of a Synced up account and also was used to Read group membership of a security group that had all users with access in it so if one was disabled it would then force a password change Now with a managed Identity I understand it is suppose to be easier but am not able to get it to Write the changed password . I assume it will also have issues with the group membership changes script also.
 Here is the only snippet of the Script where the Run as account was called
 ## get automation account: $connection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection $azconnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection Connect-AzureAD -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $connection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $connection.CertificateThumbprint write-output "Connected Azure AD" Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $azconnection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $azconnection.CertificateThumbprint write-output "Connected AZ Accounts"

Yes, you can mix and match Microsoft 365 plans. Please note that there are some license limitations at the plan level. The Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans each have a limit of 300 users, while the Enterprise plans are for an unlimited number of users.

 I'm relatively new to working with Layer 3 and am in the process of rolling out some new routers to some of our satellite sites using Aruba Layer 3 (2930f, 3810m) switches.

 However, it seems the 2930s can only support 8 OSPF interfaces? This means I'm forced to use redistribute connected on the OSPF router which makes routes show as External2 (doesn't feel right to me).
 Is this the accepted correct way to configure this or am I missing something somewhere? Thanks!

 I'm currently testing with a laptop into the connection so to bypass any possibility it's something internal
 Ethernet shows connected at 100Mb Speed test results from https://www.speedtest.net/ show download speed in the 20-50Mb, upload looks better as we get 75-90 sometimes. A speed test via Google gets similar download speeds.
 Is there a better tool for checking speed? 
 I understand we won't get 100Mb and that they only offer the speed within their own network but I'd hope to be getting faster speeds than what we have. We've not used Vodafone before and this is not a good experience so far, support has pretty much got me to run ping on the laptop for a few minutes - thankfully this is a backup connection.

 Context is I need to set the ecs cluster instance IP as a var inside all containers for specific logging requirements. The instances rotate frequently for new upgrades etc so the ip changes hence this needs to be automated.
 I've tried a bunch of stuff, and aws even provide a Metadata file that's accessible in all containers for this but I'm unable to retrieve this in a system wide environment variable and it looks like ECS doesn't support this and just passes in the var as a literal string even though it's using docker under the hood and it works in docker fine. 
 I've tried using entrypoint and command parameters and can export variables but this isn't system wide in the containers and they need to be sourced from file or require an interactive shell login e.g /etc/environment or /etc/profile etc
 Any ideas would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I am not sure if this is right community for my question but maybe someone will be able to comment.
 I am working with 5G enabled technology and I was wondering if there exists any networking device that is compatible with 3GPP release 16 5G network (similar to this https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g_ax but would support rel.16 features). Since release 16 is probably not rolled out by mobile network operators I was wondering if it is even possible to buy rel.16 compatible device in advance. My concerns arise from specific features promised by 3GPP rel.16 for example Integrated Access and Backhaul, CV2X (Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything) which doesnt sound like regular 5G features therefore would require specific modems, right? Another thing is that for example Mikrotik on its product page doesnt even specify specific 3GPP release, only available 5G bands which I think indicates that this release doesnt even matter and this model will be compatible with future versions of 5G. Is that correct?
 I guess my question boils down to - is there any public information from MNO vendors wheter these 3GPP features will even be enabled and if they will be - can I buy hardware for it in advance?

 Throwaway for reasons.
 Posting here as a fallback in case anyone else is seeing this.
 I work for a small-medium MSP and we have a data center where we host customer servers on a Windows Failover Cluster.
 In the last month or so we are seeing (seemingly randomly) RDS Session hosts reporting "offline" in our RMM.
 Notes / Symptoms
  
You can still ping the server (internally)
 You CANNOT browse to any UNC Share (C$, Admin$ etc)
 The FO Role is still "Running" you can open a console session however it will not authenticate to the DC (Domain not available)
 All current users are kicked from the session host
 It DOES NOT happen to all session hosts at once (ie in a farm of 5, 1 will go offline and the others remain online)
 We THINK it is related to Sophos, uninstalled and the issue does not occur (it occured once but we are taking that as a one off)
 Seemingly not related to a Windows Patch
  
Environment(s)
  
Server 2019
 FSLogix with dedicated profile server
 AV Sophos Intercept X Advanced
  
The only way to get it back is to hard power the role down in FO Cluster Manager and then back on, it comes back up fine as if nothing happened.
 Currently we are shifting problem customers/servers to our VMware farm which seems a lot more stable but this is not really something we can do quickly.
 Anyone else seeing this at all? MSFT and Sophos are being very little help indeed, but we are plugging away with them in any case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR; manipulated the school system, got caught, then got the job as an admin a few years down the line. 
 When I was at secondary / high school, my ICT lessons were always the best. It was a time where I did 20% work, and 80% trying to exploit the system to gain some sort of advantage over the other standard student accounts. Now, I wasn’t doing this for any malicious intent, just for personal satisfaction. 
 Our school had everything very locked down as most did for a student. The limitations were as I would compare to an exam/ kiosk type account at the time. One IT lesson, I was looking at the pxe boot options and found they were using SCCM. I was hit with a login screen and almost admitted defeat. I thought, what the hell and tried my student details. They worked 
 Turns out the sysadmins had just added the \domainusers group to authenticate. Once launched, I was able to re deploy a Windows environment and more notably to me at the time, create a local admin account. Once I found this out, I was able to sit at my allocated computer and happily install all the programs I wanted and hide my tracks. ICT lessons then turned into 100% fun. 
 One day, I got caught out by a teacher remotely viewing my screen and got called to the IT office. Had to explain what I had done and instead of a slap on the wrist, I was praised for finding the exploit! 
 2 years after I left the school, I then got a job as a system admin at the same school and even used that scenario to my advantage during my interview. 
 And we all lived happily ever after!

 Visually it will write [name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com) but behind the stage it's writing [name@domain.co](mailto:name@domain.co) span span m which doesn't make sense.
 In a normal case it should write this instead.

 I know it's been asked a million times but wanted some fresh insight.
 We are a small business, 15TB of data on our server. After migrating servers I was made aware of crashplans terrible speeds...
 I searched other posts and a lot of people reccomend Backblaze.
 We only pay ~$18 a month for Crashplan, with Backblaze it would be about $75 a month for storage alone, with another $20 a month (I believe) for something like cloudberry to pair with Backblaze.
 It's a pretty extreme price jump, and considering our office is in Australia (Blazeback is US based), would you guys have any suggestions?
 Server:
 Windows Server 2022 (VM)
 64GB of ram

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a newer company that has grown rapidly over the past 10 years and has had a “whatever it takes” approach to things in the past, but is now pushing to mature by standardizing our tools, software and procedures. 
 This has ruffled feathers with some of the more seasoned end users, who get frustrated with us and sometimes even get snarky when they find out that a license has been deactivated and they’re now expected to change a workflow. 
 While I’m now in a senior position, I spent many previous years in pure HelpDesk getting here and I’ve come to realize that that I’ve got the hero, people pleaser DNA inside of me. I pride myself on exceeding expectations and giving end users the best service I possibly can. On the flip side, I struggle a lot with conflict or disappointing end users to the point that it gives me anxiety. 
 I’ve come to realize now that saying “No” is a critical skill I need to get better at if I want to grow further in my career. I know that you can’t please everyone, and often the company you work for is going to expect you to enforce policies whether you personally agree or not. 
 Does anyone have any insight, advice or strategies on how I could get better at this kind of thing? Thanks!

 When I launch my RDP session and click "Connect" it prompts me for my pin and after entering it, fully connects through the gateway. But once the connection hits my workstation, it prompts me for either smart card or username/password. I click smart card and it shows "Insert a smart card" but doesn't seem to be reading it (no certificates pop up). 
 I believe I enabled the correct GPO settings, since I'm able to connect to the RD Gateway:
 -Force the reading of all certificates from the smart card
 -Turn on Smart Card Plug and Play Service 
 Is there something I'm missing? 
 RDP Settings: All settings checked under "Local devices and resources->More..." Advanced Tab->"Settings..." -Use these RD Gateway server settings: -Servername: *RD GATEWAY server name* -Logon Method: Smart Card or Windows Hello for Business -Logon Settings->Checked "Use my RD Gateway credentials for the remote computer"

Typically when I see that the email server is some random VPC or a compromised host, but today I encountered one involving a thirdparty_with_typo.com hosted on Exchange online, and targetcompany_with_typo.com hosted on G Suite. 
 I reported both to their registrars, and then went to look into reporting the G Suite and M365 tenants themselves and found that a bit more interesting.
 For G Suite I couldn't even find where to do it (everything seemed to point towards individual gmail accounts, not G Suite), and for Microsoft I found https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/cars - but they closed the case after a couple minutes stating:
  
The activity reported is associated with a customer account within the Microsoft Azure service. Microsoft Azure provides a cloud computing platform in which customers can deploy their own software applications. Customers, not Microsoft, control what applications are deployed on their account.
  
So, does Microsoft not actually care about crimes committed using their services, or did I just luck into the wrong support rep responding and closing without understanding.
 FWIW too, the one on Exchange online is spoofing a massive global company (250k+ employees) registered about a month prior to the target, so I wouldn't be surprised if my guys weren't the only ones targeted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinion & Advice - Cloud / Network
 Hi All! I’ve got a bit of a decision to make….stay in my current role or move out.
 I have a significant background in networking (17yrs) and transitioned to a leadership position as a manager of the network team at my current company. 
 Recently, I was given an opportunity to transition from networking to cloud due to an organizational re-alignment. So I’ve been spending my recent days learning our Cloud platform, Terraform, CI/CD, etc….
 I knew this was going to be a big challenge - but it would come with big opportunities - especially for future growth. It’s been less than a year and things aren’t going great in the role. I have a new leader and everything just feels disorganized and faltering. Our Cloud strategy isn’t strategic and i feel like im fighting against the tide (ex. Let’s migrate everything..Cloud is simple).
 Even the new direction the company is taking has me concerned about its long term viability.
 I have an opportunity to transition back to a Network Manager role with a different company. I love networking!
 My concern…am I making a short term and short sighted move? Cloud is 100% in more demand that networking. Will I look back in 5yrs or 10yrs and kick myself? Should I stick it out at my current company (10yrs seniority) and hope for the best and gain as much experience I can as a Cloud Manager….which isn’t a lot of hands on exposure.
 On the other hand I go into work each day fearing for my job, I’m not happy, and I’m starting to worry that if I wait too long the job market might shift shortly that might result in limited opportunities.
 Looking for the opinion of my peers 😊

 I ran into 2 cases of the issue this week and tried every which way to fix --- my users' Win10 VDI terminals would auto-lock after 1 minute. However, if I rebooted them and logged in, the problem didn't happen. Then, if I logged out and back in, the problem started up again. Very annoying and tricky to troubleshoot. To make it more annoying, the problem would eventually fix itself over night and the user could log in again and work normally. I'm relatively new here and my coworker said he'd never been able to fix it, confirming as well that it would eventually fix itself over-night.
 Repairing VMWare Tools didn't help either. A complete, total uninstall of VMWare Tools and a reboot completely fixed the issue. What clued me in was reading in some forum about a person that updated their mouse driver and had that fix the problem. Sure enough, that was it.

 Now, there is no shortage of IT asset management software options available, but the difference between them, or any of them, is that they are either open-source or cloud-based. What factors influence your decision? Simple. Your organization's size, the types and quantities of assets you want to track/record, and frankly, how much money you're willing to spend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Junos has a feature called 'load replace'.
  
with XR7 'commit replace' is basically 'write erase' it deletes the whole config.
 'load harddisk:configfile.txt' is merging with existing config.
  
Is there a way to do replace the entire config in a single step? something like this: 'commit replace harddisk:newconfig.txt confirmed 180'
 I sort of found a way with xrreplace in ZTP_helpers but wondering if there's a simpler/better way to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a couple of issues where the built-in TDR cable test on a Meraki MS120 switch reports cable length of over 100 meters when the actual length is 40 meters or less. Right now I'm looking at one where a MR70 AP is connected and can only get 100 Mbps. The cable test shows an estimated length of 120.75 meters and no connection on pairs 3 & 4. The tech on site had a basic connectivity tester and showed good connectivity on all conductors. Considering where the switch and AP are, I can't imagine the actual cable length being much over 25 meters even with a service loop. (I don't expect the built-in test to be super accurate on cable length, but being like 500% high is a bit much.)
 Has anyone else seen cable issues that cause such high length reports and know what kind of things might cause it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 We're getting close to having to replace our current SDWAN solution due to the vendor EOLing the product. Currently we use it to tie all our remote site DIAs into a tunnel back to 2 central sites for our workers there to access central resources, with all the SDWAN goodies thrown in as well. 
 We already have FGT firewalls at all our sites and will most likely continue to use them in the future. Currently we use their SLAs and other traffic steering features that their SDWAN presents at face value, but are the advanced features comparable to a full SDWAN solution that would provide a tunnel back to a central location? 
 We're a pretty big SDWAN shop, I'd like to utilize our current hardware but if it can't match up to something independent like Cisco's or Riverbed then we will have to explore that route instead (I really would like to avoid Cisco SDWAN, had enough of a time w/ that in the updated CCNP).

 Current "links in the chain" are:
  
Core switch: TP-Link T1600G-52PS, codename "Colonel"
 SFP module LC/UPC (TP-Link TL-SM311LS)
 60M OS2 single mode fiber (SMF) LC/LC patch cable from Amazon.

The SFP module and the cable seem to be compatible and connected fine with an audible *click*.
 VLANS:
  
80: Management. Each managed switch has a static IP in subnet 80:

 OtherSwitch1=192.168.80.5
 OtherSwitch2=192.168.80.6

 I'm working with a client trying to figure out some email deliverability issues. While investigating, I discovered one of their ESP is using their domain and not the client's for the DKIM domain. That's getting that switched to use my client's domain, but I didn't even think this was possible.
 Relevant headers from a test message showing it passing SPF (client's domain) and DKIM (ESP's domain):
  
Authentication-Results:
 spf=pass (sender IP is x.x.x.x) smtp.mailfrom=service.client.com;
 dkim=pass (signature was verified) header.d=esp.com; dmarc=bestguesspass action=none
 header.from=client.com; compauth=pass reason=109
 DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=esp.com; i=@esp.com; s=dkim; c=relaxed/relaxed;
 q=dns/txt; t=1665520754; x=1668112754; h=content-transfer-encoding:content-type:subject:date:to:from:mime-version:list-unsubscribe:x-thread-info:subject:to:from:cc:reply-to;bh=jdBAlGXcZ<snipped>KDm8k=
 From: donotreply@client.com
  
If there doesn't need to be any type of domain name alignment, what prevents a rogue actor from just putting their own DKIM-Signature there. Yeah it could be discovered...but who looks at SMTP headers of all their messages. The damage from a phishing attack or similar may have already been done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some general input as I'm having trouble coming up with reasons for a specific implementation use case.
 Assumptions:
 - All network access requires Machine Auth 802.1x
 - VLANs separate various computer groups
 - Currently we have a VLAN for Corp WiFi and Corp Network (wired computers)
 - Devices at each branch will never surpass a /23 which is what the corp network (wired computers) is configured for
 - Only the devices which also have the access to join Corp Network (wired) can connect to WiFi
 - Max Devices connected to a single AP would be 50 devices
 ​
 Question:
 Is there any reason why a corp devices which connects via 802.1x WiFi should be put on a separate VLAN or would it be advisable just to join them to the same VLAN they'd join if they were wired?
 ​
 I've seen every business I've worked for separate these networks but while thinking of it I can't really decide why this is happening. I guessed it could be something to do with limiting broadcasts but I'm not sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of my users are on the road a lot, and while the standard built in antennas on Verizon's jetpacks are OK for most areas, we're having issues in specific spots at certain times of day. Talking to my users, here is what they are experiencing:
  
Still getting 4 bars of service
 Intermittent connection drops (download/upload arrows go away) despite the 4 bars remaining
 Apps that require a constant connection drop and need to be logged into again
 Moving the unit around seems to reacquire download/upload (possibly placebo effect)
  
I'm looking into solutions to improve their connection. What I'm not clear on is what the issue is. Doing a bit of research leads me to believe this might be more of an issue of traffic congestion on the tower they are connecting to, or signal interference due to being in a busy area/time of day, than the connection to the tower itself, since they are still getting full bars but receiving poor quality connection.
 Would a signal boosting antenna even help in this case? To me it sounds more like there's too much interference and/or the towers are too busy in these locations and times of day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm currently a mid level manager at a small ISP. I recently started looking for new roles and have been offered what seems like a great opportunity.
 The offer is for a network manager role at a more senior level. Its again a small ISP, the network needs a lot of work, a full redesign. Which is exciting. Fully remote, occasional on site meetings. I do have my doubts about work load as I'd basically be architect and people manager.
 I've accepted and signed the contract.
 But then, yesterday, another role that I'd been waiting on for a while finally came through. This job would push me harder from a technical perspective, but it comes with no seniority. It also requires 3 days a week in the office and would be far less flexible. Did feel more rapport with the interviewers here. 
 I know only I can make this decision. But any tips on how I make it?! They both have their pros and cons, they both offer good progression for my career one way or another. Can't stop thinking about it and still not getting any closer to making a decision!

 We're in the process of configuring various parts of Intune and currently use SCCM. All our devices are now enrolled into Into intune and are Hybrid Azure AD Joined.
 I’m trying to get Windows Update notification popups working for all our Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune, but can’t seem to find the right settings. Currently we have the small restart icon at the bottom right in the task bar but we want to have a pop-up notification so users will be notified in a more obvious way. I think the problem is the following setting in the Advanced Windows Update Settings on all devices. 
 'Show a notification when your PC requires a restart to finish updating' 
 This is grayed out and looks to be set to ‘Off’ but I cannot find where this setting is controlled. As these are all Hybrid Joined devices in Co-management I’ve checked through Group Policy and in our Update Rings policy and Windows Update Configuration Policy but I cant find where to enable this setting.
 Does anyone know where this setting is?

 Accountability isn't a problem, we just need to get better and avoid the "hey did you see that email/dashboard message?" That's the plan right now, just making sure we take turns being proactive about reading a distro and heading to the health dashboard. 
 What do you guys do? Any fancy technology or process to get advised and take action?

In first year we used it as big l2 switch, later we implemented ospf l3outs and became gateway for some networks and now we implemented PBR to selectively forward traffic to PBR firewall. PBR has become game changer for us as security guys no more has to deal with unnecessary chunk of traffic which makes firewall use resources to the limit. Now while http traffic between two servers is being redirected to firewall, logging traffic between same servers forwarded directly by ACI thanks to specific contracts.
 We are thinking on what else we can implement on ACI to make life easier. How do you use ACI?

 I have a client who has just bought himself a new mac book running MacOS 12. When I have gotten the device connected into their file shares running on their on prem Server 2012R2. Whenever he creates a folder on the server it will appear immediately, however if he tries to add or edit a file the changes will take up to 3 minutes to show on the server. The changes can take place almost immediately or after a few minutes (almost like it has some kind of polling rate?)
 Interestingly enough if he tries to change a file somebody else is accessing then it will duplicate and show a '°' at the end of the duplicate file.
 I have searched up on the Internet and could see that there were numerous other people having similar problems online specifically with using SMB with this version of MacOS.
 It is worth noting he still has his old mac book that can use the file shares without issue.
 I have tried creating a separate file share and setting the permissions with full access for everyone but still experiencing the same problems.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. And I can provide any further details if needed.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got several cases, where users complain that after Monthly patches being installed they see only one notification from Software Center (Config Manager), it's the last one which gives them 15 minutes to a forced reboot. It was not a case for everyone so I started digging and I found that it happens only for people who use the "Focus Assist" feature in Windows 10 (former name "Quiet hours"). So it was obvious that people who have set "Alarms only" won't see the reboot notifications, but there is also an option called "Priority only", where you can select applications that can show notifications - this works well when the user chooses Software Center as a priority app manually, via the GUI.
 I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to centrally add items to the priority applications list (via GPO or script)?
 The ideal solution would be to:
  
Disable "Alarms only" mode in Focus Assist
 have a possibility to add "Software Center" to the priority list applications

 I set it up in my lab and the only thing i dont understand is, how the other Domain should make use of the Selective Authentication when he doesnt have access to our Domain to select the Users which should be able to authenticate on their resources.
 When i click on the resource domain on ntfs settings, i can change the location to the other Domain but will be prompted for credentials access it.
 How can i manage it so the other Site can configure their Selective Authentication without Domain Credentials from my Domain?
 i cant really find any resource on that.. Just some Videos where they enter the Domain Admin from the Domain, which is a huge security concern for me.

 My IT team has recently been hired to work at a 1300+ user school and have taken over the whole operation from the old staff. It’s a mix of around 300 BYOD laptops and 1000 supplied Windows laptops.
 The virtual infrastructure is an absolute mess. Blends of Server 2012/2016 VM’s running on an outdated ESXI host.
 We would like to rebuild the VM’s for starters (File/Print, DC1, DC2, NPS) but we’re not sure how to do this to minimise downtime, especially for the BYOD devices.
 The file/print server would be the biggest headache. Next would be cutting over NPS and making sure all of the devices connect up okay.
 How do you even begin to do this to prevent any downtime/issues with a site of this scale?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This problem stumps me and my colleagues to no end...
 I'm hoping someone here can help think this through?
 One of our endusers has the problem where his ethernet connection drops at random intervals, and his Wi-Fi doesn't pick up the slack automatically either.
 Here's what we tried:
  
New UTP cable
 New docking station
 Connected the cable directly (without docking station)
 Gave him another laptop (issue occurs on 2 laptops now)
 Colleagues tried the same outlets/the same cables, and they can work just fine
  
There are no overarching GPOs on his laptop that cause this.
 One thing we saw was that his domain firewall profile was set to ON while it should be OFF.
 That can't be the cause because it was the same for me and I have no issues whatsoever.
 I started checking winevt logs.
 We can pinpoint when the system dropped UTP and the user had to manually connect to Wi-Fi instead:
 A request was made to authenticate to a wireless network.
 Logged: 12/10/2022 11:05:32
 Checked the Security winevt logs; all we saw was the firewall started to check all policies right after the system lost UTP connection. After Googling possible ethernet drop issues I wanted to disable the Energy/Green Energy/Wake on Magic settings in his ethernet adapter to see if that could help, but I can't reach his device right now. When he's forced to make a manual switch to Wi-Fi we have to reverse connect to his laptop and then run an ipconfig /registerdns before we can continue troubleshooting (most likely due to the fact we are in the middle of a DNS server cutover and those managing the transfer are veggies...).
 Even though, these are all things that shouldn't transfer from one laptop to another yet he's had the problem on 2 laptops one after the other now.
 Anyone have any clue on what could be causing this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I have a UDM Pro SE which has fiber on WAN1 and a 4G router on WAN2 (a Teltonika RUT241).
 The 4G router does CGNAT, so in order to easily reach the Web GUI for admin purposes I've installed ZeroTier on it and it works well, I can reach it from a LAN device (a mac mini) with ZeroTier installed.
 BUT, Tailscale works so much better for me, so that's what I'm using on all other devices (the 4G router doesn't support Tailscale, only ZeroTier).
 My question is if I can somehow bride the LAN to the ZeroTier network using the mac mini as a bridge since it has a network interface for both networks? When I'm inside my LAN using Tailscale I'd like to route traffic to the Zerotier network (192.168.192.0/24) via the mac mini.
 I'm guessing I should setup a static route, pointing traffic going to the destination network 192.168.192.0/24 through the LAN device on 192.168.5.142 (the mac mini), but do I need to do something on the mac mini to make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Not sure if I’m somehow missing it, but we’re implementing some 80KM dark fiber and we purchased some 100G 80KM QSFP28 modules at 1310nm. However, the loss is a bit high (no link possible) so we wanted to try 1550nm which of course has better attenuation figures, but I can’t locate any QSFP28 100G modules operating at 1550nm??
 Funnily enough though I have found posts in this subreddit with people saying that at 80KM all DWDM modules will be 1550nm - but the exact opposite seems to be true.
 The loss over the link appears to be about 23-26dBm according to our 10G 1650nm 80KM modules, so I’d expect at 1310 it’s closer to 36db of loss.
 I assume the recommendation would be EDFA, but any other suggestions for reliable 100G over this link would be appreciated :)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's put aside the fact that throughout the years whenever I faced a problem with CPU usage/high clock I usually faced a 95+ System idle. I faced similar situations on Linux with 100% of the cases ending in htop (linux command) showing me the exact culprit. If not by CPU usage then by CPU wakes.
 Recently my opinion solidified when facing the highest CPU usage I've ever seen on Windows 10 on my laptop. This time I knew the culprit upfront (broken windows search, confirmed by windows reliability history error messages). Windows Search constantly banged the CPU and failed to start, CPU die constantly at 65 deg C. As soon as I fixed Windos Search the CPU die temperature dropped to ~40 deg C! The thing is the entire time neither of the built-in Windows Tools (including the Sysinternals Process Explorer) showed any useful information on the issue. No listed component spiked to more than 3-5% of CPU. Even the memory usage tab in Resource Monitor was better at hinting the culprit than the releavant CPU sections!
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 I'm running a small scale test on 802.1x in preparation for a company-wide rollout. We're using Cisco catalyst + Microsoft NPS with EAPTLS. On the Windows side of thing everything is working flawlessly but I'm struggling to get a working MAB policy on NPS for the IP Phones (This model does not support 802.1x) 
 I have seen a few methods of configuring MAB on NPS. One involves setting up a user with username/password as the MAC address. This wont work in my environment as the password is just getting rejected due to complexity requirements. 
 The 2nd method I have seen involves setting up a connection request policy like so : 
 Conditions: 
  
NAS Port Type = Ethernet
 Calling Station ID = ^00-00-00-00-00$|^11-11-11-11-11$ 
  
Authentication: 
  
'Accept users without verifying credentials'
  
The the switchport is configured like so: 
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1 description Access-Port switchport access vlan 101 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 107 access-session host-mode multi-domain access-session closed access-session port-control auto mab dot1x pae authenticator spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable service-policy type control subscriber DOT1X2MAB end 
 When connecting the PC works fine, but the IP phone is failing , then the switchport gets err disabled as a result. Is anyone able to advise on where I am going wrong ? Documentation on MAB in NPS seems to be lacking

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a bind to look for an elegant solution to get the following failover solution working and I wondered if anyone here might have any ideas? 
 Diagram as follows : Diagram 
 Simple two site setup with both sites having their own WAN link for internet as well as site to site connectivity. 
 The MPLS wans are setup with eBGP so each Cisco router receives the prefix of the other site via that WAN link for reachability to each other. 
 The LANs of both routers are setup with two subnets and are setup using VRRP. with each router acting as the active VRRP group for each subnet: 
 Site1 : 192.168.1.254
 Site2 : 192.168.0.254
 VRRP is setup so in the event of the WAN going down the other router takes over as VRRP master. 
 This means that as well as resilience that both WAN links are fully utilised instead of all traffic just using the one WAN link. All good! 
 The issue is that due to the point to point interface and VRRP that if the point to point dies so site1 can no longer reach site2 using the point to point that you would want that traffic to go out via the WAN into the MPLS to reach the other site. 
 The problem is of course it won't do that due to each of the Cisco routers having LAN's which belong to both subnets. So if traffic was going from Site1 to Site2 then as soon as those packets destined for 192.168.0.0/24 hit the Site1 router then it would just not send it out's its WAN as it has an interface belonging to that subnet which is up and part of the VRRP group. 
 This is the problem I'm trying to solve. A solution which I don't like is to create a EMM script which will shut down that LAN in the event traffic is no longer using the P2P but I don't like how messy that could be. 
 Anyone got any ideas or suggestions then I'm open to them :) 
 I hope that made at least some sense?

Will be migrating items from two source locations to M365 GCC/Gov't Tenant as the destination (hence the reason I am migrating to a new tenant). Destination M365 tenant will be cloud only/no AD Connect in place. 
 Source locations and use are:
  
Google Workspace -mail, contacts, calendars, Drive data - migrating using BitTitan (no issues here and the migration is already pre-staged/processing)
 M365 Commercial/Non Gov't Tenant- Used for MS Office licensing and small bit of unexpected OneDrive use. This tenant uses AD Connect to sync users to local AD at the moment and has the company domain name in use as the primary domain for all users.
  
I am planning on performing this migration this weekend and need to confirm what my process should be to either disable or decommission AD Connect from the existing M365 commercial tenant but keep the users intact (just in case I need to manually move any data over)- while allowing me to remove the company domain in use on the existing M365 tenant. 
 I'm familiar on the process of decommissioning AD Connect in full, but know that can take up to 72 hours and I can't make any changes during that time. What process should I be following if I want to make the users cloud only/change their usernames to .onmicrosoft.com addresses from the tenant so I can remove the company domain from the existing M365 tenant at the same time (hopefully in one evening?)

 Wifi SSID will not be broadcasted to limit wireless devices. 
 Am I even remotely on the right path to accomplish this? There is only one ISP available at this location and they can't provide a separate service just for the deli.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I'm in charge of setting up the 802.1x for a new site we are moving to. I work for a company with around 200 sites around the country and a pretty big DC with ACI, ISE, SD-WAN etc.... all across these sites.
 The normal way of doing things like segregating users has been via VLANS and FW rules. However with this new site I've setup and tested an 802.1x config I've done with TEAP for Windows users, EAP-TLS for MAC'S and MAB for cameras etc... all working. My plan was to see what AD group the user coming into ISE was in and the delegate them a VLAN tag on ISE and pass it back to the Authenticator switch, it all works. But after speaking to my lead today, he suggested a couple of things or ways of going about doing user segregation at the new site.
 We have been talking about what is the best way to go about IP addressing schemes for users at the site, do we create seperate VLAN's for infrastructure/networks, finance, HR etc.... with their own subnets or do we put them all into one big range (a big broadcast L2 domain I know, but kit these days can handle it to be honest) and then look to use SGT's on ISE and assign them segregation based off them that way.
 Any opinions or other suggestions would be welcome.
 Thanks everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we are having an issue when some of our spoke sites that have 2x MPLS circuts (no broadband etc...) and one circut is a higher bandwidth than the other in all of them, I never set the solution up but it is live in production now and if the primary link fails, then it takes a good few mins to switch over to the second lower bandwidth link. There are 2 static routes going out both links (same administrative distance) but the second lower bandwidth link has been set to the "last resort circuit" command and the primary higher bandwidth link is the only link/interface that appears in the routing table.
 In comparison, the same setup is also on sites that have the same bandwidth across both links, if the primary circuit fails then it is a seamless transition to the second circuit and both static routes are in the routing table to.
 Anyone any advice on where/what I could look to change in order to make this work better and for the second link at the sites with unequal bandwidth links, to be able to seamlessly switch over to the second link?
 Cheers

 We are working on a project where a run from the network room will lead outside, underground through a conduit, and then to an outdoor area. This is about 300ft. Then there will be a run from that outdoor area to another outdoor area roughly 300ft out. To me, that is something multimode fiber can easily handle, but I'd like to hear what others have experience with. I know the cost will be higher for transceivers, but this is for a third party client. Im not trying to nickel or dime or mess with a sale for a cable company, but I also want to learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've taken over responsibility for an Aruba 6000 48G R8N86A switch that in another state and I cannot get signed in. I have an old config file showing the local accounts with ciphertext passwords, as well as the radius config with ciphertext of the pre-shared key.
 Access-Requests hit the radius server (Windows server NPS) and are rejected with "Authentication failed due to a user credentials mismatch. Either the user name provided does not map to an existing user account or the password was incorrect."
 I am using known good credentials.
 If I change the PSK in NPS, I continue to get the same error message so I suspect NPS client config might have the wrong PSK.
 Question 1. Is there a way to reverse the cipher text on the PSK?
 I attempted to set up new connection request policy in NPS, and under SETTINGS->AUTHENTICATION I checked the box for "Accept users without validating credentials" and then I see Access-Accept sent back to the switch, but the switch still rejects with "Access Denied".
 Question 2. Does this not work how I think it would? Any other way to force a successful authentication in NPS to get logged in?
 I also blocked radius traffic from switch->Radius server to get it to time out and attempt local creds. No documented creds will work.
 Question 3. Similar to Q1. Is there a way to recover local password from the ciphertext?
 There is no remote support at this location. I'll have to drive 6 hours to reset it if needed... Lol

 When rounded to the nearest thousandth, most input errors are 0.002%. I read a Net craftsmen post saying that anything above 0.001% should be investigated.
 In most cases, the switch is reporting a 0.000% output error rate.
 In some cases, both the switch and the node show an error rate. Examples below.
 Most of the connections are to the same switch; I'm not sure this matters.
  
​
  
 Node Node input error rate Switch output error rate 
  
 1 0.002% 0.000% 
  2 0.002% 0.009% 
 
 ​
  
Do you agree with that threshold for error rate troubleshooting?
 If yes, would you clean only the SFP/Fiber on the node side if the node is showing errors but the switch is not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm inheriting a job supporting a SATCOM hub network at a teleport. It's a small-ish site that provides Internet or managed network access to a few hundred remote SATCOM terminals via a small number of high bandwidth uplinks. My background is in radio networking (MANET, microwave, trunked voice & data, etc) but I'm fairly competent with Cisco R&S gear.
 This site has been badly neglected and is in acute need of a tech refresh. It currently has about 12-14 access switches and six routers that manage IP traffic between the modems and other infrastructure, and an old ASA that connects to the Internet and provides remote access via AnyConnect. I plan to replace the switches and routers pretty quickly, and the firewall soon after.
 I'm going to write a preliminary proposal to outline the tech refresh project and justify funding for subsequent trade studies and eventual capital purchase.
 Now for my question: I'm a little turned off by Cisco's extremely high prices, the complexity of their feature licensing, and also their super long lead times right now. I have positive impressions towards Juniper and Extreme gear, though my experience with them is limited. Given the relative simplicity of this network, I've wondered if I could get by using Ubiquiti or Mikrotik, but ultimately I think we'll want a paid support option. Assuming a homogeneous environment meaningfully reduces complexity and risk, is there a single brand that might be best suited for this application?

It came apart easily and packed into a backpack so he could travel from data center to data center working. There was a link to it and it was a small company making these specifically for technician field work. 
 Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? I've searched and have been unable to find anything beyond cheap plasticy tripod options on Amazon that don't look like they'll hold up for professional use.

I’ll allow typing in for cross-VLAN or other setups, but would like to suggest them units where possible to make it easier. 
 What is the best way to do this? I see this with things like my tplink controller where it can find my access points on the network and suggest them to me. Is this just brute force pinging each IP in the subnet at a specific endpoint and looking for a certain response?
 Not looking for a full on explanation, just need a term or concept to be able to research more into. And looking for suggestions as I’m sure there are many ways to do this. Thanks!

 I constantly screw myself on a daily basis by making assumptions. I can't count the amount of times where I have been handed an issue by a junior tech and started working on more complex solutions but in the end it was something simple that someone forgot to check or assumed was correct.
 The only safe assumption is that no one has done anything correctly ever and everyone is lying to you. Users will make things sound extremely severe to get a problem solved quicker, techs will make assumptions and pass those assumptions on to you. If you haven't seen that information yourself, then you're working off of a paper foundation in the middle of a hurricane. I know this sounds extremely pessimistic, but Dr. House was right all along.
 The amount of time wasted double-checking something is almost never as long as the amount of time wasted trying to solve a problem that you may already know the solution too.

Making that NFS share highly available / fully redundant is an exercise left to the implementer, and I'm waffling a bit on deciding what makes sense.
 Solution needs to be fully replicated, clustered, and highly available (instant failover either during outage or during deployments). We also need to be able to support our DR process which currently is replicating on prem VMware VMs to Azure.
 We were going to go with GlusterFS, but just found out that Redhat has killed that product and we definitely want enterprise support for whatever solution we choose. Their replacement, Cephs, seems to be way overkill for what we need.
 Would love some suggestions! Thanks!

 The problem is we don't control what an app (Teams, Outlook, 1000 in house apps, 300 SaaS apps, and more) chooses to use.
 From LDAP alone the apps can get SN, CN, givenName, lastName, displayName, etc. Then you have HR legal name, Peoplesoft preferred name, etc.
 Edit: add job title to the mix while we are at it.
 We just can't force all apps to use the same source. And if we did, the name would still be wrong from the user's perspective many times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Short version: What is the best way to do a local domain mesh that supports local broadcast protocols, as well as some L2 jiggery pokery on an airgapped network?
 Long version:
 Large scale professional audio/video/lighting networks currently all setup as airgapped switched only networks with a lot of protocols relying on local broadcast for discovery and function. As these networks get bigger we run in to topology problems trying to maintain HA/resiliency/redundancy.
 It gets very awkward when your network is down, the show is stopped and you have a live audience of 20000 people and millions watching on television.
 Most networks end up as a ring (with RSTP or EAPS), or as one long daisy-chain (broken ring). Some folks will run parallel links (that are unconnected until one fails and then the spare gets manually plugged in)
 It looks like TRILL would have been a solution, but it seems that it really never took off, so I am looking at routing solutions.
 Requirements: fast convergence times, once routers are configured the first time: plug and play operation in the field, loop/feedback protection, mesh ability, and the endpoints see all local broadcast traffic.
 From what I gather OSPF/EVPN/VXLAN might be the solution?!? Any other ideas, links or info on configuring those together? Pitfalls?
 For reference, some lighting networks:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is more of a vent if anything. I think this move Zoom made to rebrand 'Chat' to 'Team Chat' was such an oversight. Idk if their marketing people and PMs have no idea what they are doing. or if they simply don't care to review changes. 
 My first gripe:
 the changed the name to Team chat. gag. 
  
there is already a product called... teams. nice move Zoom
 not everyone who i am messaging is part of my 'team'- like someone from a different team or an external person like my sales rep. it would have made 100% more sense to call this Company Chat. 
 there reason for doing this was because people got 'confused' when using meeting chat vs Zoom Chat. So they changed it for everyone because the free users and guest users got confused. lol
  
But this is the part that got me. is this blog post:
 https://blog.zoom.us/work-better-together-with-zoom-team-chat/
 they try to talk about 'toggle tax' and then try to justify not using email and just use Zoom Team chat. This is a major SMH 
 "Need to share an important design and the context behind it with a colleague? Don’t break focus by signing into your email account and drafting an email — simply pop into Team Chat, type up a message, attach the file at the click of a button, and hit send!" 
 Can't say i have ever had an app tell me "use our app to talk instead of sending an email" that shit is funny. who writes this shit.

We had a leadership change and he pointed to the sky aka cloud. So that's where we are, multicloud whether we were planning it or not. It's in better shape than that sounds. 
 It's renewal time and we just don't need the complexity or cost of ACI. Knowing the switches (some of em) also support NX-OS mode and with the reduction in footprint we've had since the cloud migration I'm thinking we can migrate out of ACI by shuffling some links around, Converting some stuff to NX-OS mode and shuffling back. I don't have a fully fleshed out plan but has anyone else done it? You know how it is, if you're doing something you're probably not the first.
 Edit: I know it’s easy to switch between modes. That’s not really what I’m talking about. Asking if anyone has done it and more importantly did you hit your head on the way out? Crazy gotchas etc.

We are looking to set up a hybrid Azure AD system, as we use 365 but still have various on prem required software, and whilst watching a Microsoft video on the subject, they are trying to suggest people move away from on prem entirely, unless they're using software or older systems that explicitly require it. Is this just Microsoft trying to sell Azure and 365, or is it much more of a trend than I initially thought?
 For smaller companies, I don't see any reason not to use Azure, but it strikes me that even with a full Azure AD and Endpoint Manager suite of tools, you still lose out on a lot of configuration that group policies offer, albeit it with other advantages too

 I am looking into refreshing our core switches. One question I am running into is optical vs copper. Most of my current infrastructure is copper, but the newer servers have optical ports as well. Is copper going bye bye? Will there only be optical switches in the next 5-10 years? How will I get cables with pretty cultures to satisfy my OCD?
 EDIT: By optical I mean SFP/QSFP where you can still use copper but many use the SFP+ DAC cables.
 EDIT2: just want to say I appreciate the great responses.

They're both on asr1002x-universalk9.16.09.05.SPA.bin currently, running in bundle mode and need to be upgraded to asr1002x-universalk9.17.03.05.SPA.bin (will also require a ROMMON upgrade to asr1000-rommon.173-1r.SPA.pkg).
 Can anyone that's done a similar upgrade path (16.X.X to 17.X.X) guide me towards any pitfalls/recommendations for the upgrade procedure? Pretty much every upgrade documentation I've found talks about install mode being the best option, should I convert these or does it really matter? 
 Also with the ROMMON upgrade, can that be done in one go alongside the IOS before a reboot or does it require multiple reboots (ROMMON upgrade > reboot > IOS upgrade > reboot)?
 Thanks for the assistance!

I have a single Z: drive using OMA-URI configurations similar to this article, initially works fine. But every day it seems to try to remap it. I end up with an inaccessible Z: drive with a red X over it saying the drive letter is already in use, and then I have a Y: drive mapped to the location the Z: drive originally was, also saying the path isn't available.
 I have to remove both, remap Z: and it's fine again.
 What I'm looking to do is a (hopefully) simple powershell script that maps that drive, that I can package as an app instead of a script or configuration profile.
 I can make a script that simply maps the drive with net use easy enough and send output to a file that I can use for "install" detection, but I feel that having a check for the existing drive letter(s) first would be best since there are plenty of already-deployed Intune machines in production that will end up getting this new "app"/script applied.
 I realize I'm "asking for the fish" here, when I'd normally prefer to learn how to fish myself, but given that this is already in production I'm hoping a few of you might have the time and be willing to help me out.
 I can do a basic script in the meantime that will just blanket remove Z: and Y:, remap Z:, and send the output somewhere the user won't accidentally delete it, but I'm sure there are much more efficient ways to do so.
 Ultimately what I am hoping to accomplish:
  
Check existing drive mappings (I've found that it doesn't add a 3rd letter, so can probably focus directly on Z: and Y:)
 Remove existing mappings
 Remap Z: to the proper path
 Check Z: to confirm its accessible
 If Z: is fine, send some output to a text file that can be used for program detection so that it's not constantly executing against the same machines

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Admins!
 I have a situation where I have some clients working from home. Due to compliance, I have to prevent them from being able to talk to other devices on the network (such as home PCs, IoT devices, etc...).
 We use ESET Endpoint Antivirus and RocketCyber SIEM/SOC software. Both of those applications have an isolation mode that prevents that PC from talking to anything other than the ESET/RocketCyber console.
 Is there anyway to achieve this type of protection using only software, but still allow WAN/Internet access (so basically it can talk to the gateway and nothing else). The isolation modes in the applications I mention, prevent general WAN/Internet access as well... so they won't work in this situation.
 However, since they are able to lock it down to a specific port/application... I assume there must be some way to do what I am describing. I searched around looking for Windows Firewall rules, but those seem to be limited to very specific protocols/ports. I would like true isolation like Wireless access points do in Guest mode.
 Since this is in multiple home networks, I don't really have the option to create network segmentation (VLANs, etc...).
 Any help is greatly appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm well versed in remote desktop, having operated several for coming up to two decades. However, this is something new to me...
 We have a customer who's got 30-40 users within a latency of circa 5-10ms to the remote desktop session host. However, they've just had 4 outsourced users added from India (we're in the UK). Each Indian user is around 150-200ms.
 When we have 40 UK-based users concurrently online, the server CPU can sit roughly at 60%. However, if you swap a couple of UK users for Indians, the server CPU will spike and sometimes sit at 90% with spikes to 100% and the associated freezes you get when out of resource.
 Strangely, this manifests itself in a Windows Explorer process taking between 10-20% CPU for each user. However, if you right-click the Windows Explorer process and choose to restart it, the user sees a brief flash on their session as the explorer is reset, and CPU usage dips back to the circa 0% that it normally uses for other users. It quickly returns to the 10-20% range though.
 I was just wondering whether anyone has noticed the correlation between client latency and server CPU usage?

 Quotes / Sales Orders do not seem to have a cost price or margin? If you are supplying a Laptop to a customer, tracking profit is crucial. 
 It does have a Services section, which is a big plus as most CRM do not. We were thinking of adding monthly services, IT Support per X users, 365 licences etc. However it seems to be hell bent on having services as a per hour item. Which means it doesnt really work. 
 Why is this always so complicated?
 Do I try to customise it, or is there something better out there?

 I wasn't able to find any relevant user groups except maybe for this subreddit as I saw many posts about EATON UPSses here. The device itself is working fine and I am really happy. But some tiny thing is bugging me.
 I am running an audio interface (RME Fireface UCX II) via this UPS , next to a monitor, active studio speakers and a mac studio. When I turn the outlets of this UPS off in the evening, and wait a little, I can see the display of my Fireface briefly flashing on and off again - every 30 seconds or so.
 The power doesn't seem to cause it boot up, so I don't see anything on the display, just the backlight briefly turning on and off for a split second.
 This doesn't happen if my interface is connected to a different wall socket next to the EATON UPS.
 I have the EATON Ellipse ECO 1200W
 Is this anything to worry about? Can this cause wear on the electronics on high-precision audio devices like these?
 Already sent an email to EATON customer support but you know how these things are - sometimes you hear from them, sometimes you don't. Curious to hear your input on this!
 Thanks in advance!

(We have multiple locations - most of which have 50mb fiber as the primary connection and some flavor of cable or non-dedicated fiber as the backup.) The proposal looked promising and would save us around $200/mo per location. There would be no managed router, and supposedly I would get an online portal where I can throttle speed in real time. Not a huge need, but an interesting proposition, none the less. Of course, the ATT rep couldn't/wouldn't give me any other 'cons' that might be an issue and even said they could get us out of our current contracts and give us the same or better SLAs that we have now.
 So, I come to you, good people of Reddit. Who has experience with this ASEoD product, can offer insight as it compares to DIA fiber, or any other advice along these lines. Have you used this portal they speak of? Is it awesome or meh? Pros? Cons? TIA

 I am again in the position to generate another 1000 free places on my Udemy JNCIA course, I have been asked why I am offering it free to Reddit / LinkedIn ect and its because if I can give away the course that will benefit others.
 Some instructors just post their courses on giveaway sites and end up getting enrolments that are never used, I want to offer it to people that might at some point have a look and maybe find it useful.
 As a new instructor myself I have found the feedback to be most helpful and once my other courses are completed, they will be offered free to.
 Any feedback is welcome.
 The below code is valid for 5 days however once signed up you have the course for life.
 I thank you in advance and good luck in your studies.

 The company I work for has been purchased by another company in another continent. It's a really good business move for all involved. We're now talking about the collaboration between our IT departments, and they would like to migrate into their 365 tenant, which they have done for all of their previous acquisitions.
 I don't inherently have an issue with this, but we are considerably larger than their previous acquisitions, and utilise O365 a lot more than these smaller companies (and it sounds like we utilize more than the new parent does with regards to Azure and Intune/Autopilot, etc.).
 I did a very brief stint at an MSP before working here, and there we used some kind of Partner Portal to look after all of our 365 tenants. Is this something that the parent company can do and onboard our tenant as a whole, separate entity? I thought this was the case, but the more I look at it, the more it looks like the Partner Centre scheme is something for resellers (which the parent isn't, but the aim is for them to provide licences to us, along with collaboration on projects, so there might be some overlap there).
 Am I barking up the wrong tree here and have the wrong idea about the Partner Centre? Is there something else I should be looking at and have been searching for the wrong terminology? Or is them merging us into their tenant the best practice here?

 ​
 So all OK so far, Preview updates by default are not pushed to WSUS.
 But If we have Azure VMs, and they use Azure Update Management and for the repository they use Microsoft Update, we will probably get this "Preview" updates by default or not?
 Since we want to get rid of WSUS for the Azure VMs, what will actually happened...?
 If we have for example test environments on WSUS which are without "Preview" updates and then for production use Azure, we are going to have different updates installed there... How do you solve this in your environments, should we also deploy WSUS to Azure, or include preview updates on test environments?

Good luck to the admin when trying to figure out who receives what.

The weird thing is, this only happens for regular users, not admin users. I have been searching online and found that I could run the following command: 
  
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode –Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”} 
  
This doesn't work for me because it gets blocked by applocker. Also in the eventviewer under 'Applications and Service Logs/Microsoft/Windows/AppXDeployment-server' I see a lot of errors regarding packages that cannot be installed/updated due to applocker restrictions. Example of the error: 
  
AppX Deployment operation failed for package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy with error 0x80073D01. The specific error text for this failure is: error 0x800704EC: Deployment of package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy was blocked by AppLocker.
  
I tried to allow the packages in our applocker GPO and reboot the servers, but that didn't fix the issue either.

 I also tried to delete the firewall rules in the registery, but that does not seem to work either.

 Obviously this is not something we can do with Mac. And as it's a BYOD laptop, we are not at liberty to lock the entire laptop down. Is there any sort of data protection policy or software we can use with Mac, or are we SOL? They're basically just going to be using Office and OneDrive

 We would like to replace this notebook with a new one (more performance, Win10 etc.).
 ​
 Now to my question: do you have a special computer to test potential viruses, malware, phishing links etc.?
 If so, what is your configuration of the computer?
 ​
 - separate VLAN -> no access to the LAN
 - no domain join
 - Office installed
 - 7zip
 - Wireshark
 Have you created a way to reset the computer after running the file? Restore Point, Backup, Hyper-V or something else?
 ​
 The reason for this computer is primarily curiosity and to rule out any false positives.

 We had this issue on HP Elitebook 845 G7 and Elitebook 855 G7 but i think Elitebook 835 G7 will have this issue too.
 Since the release of Windows 11 we are Testing this new OS version in our environment. A clean install is working great an all policies are prepared. But every upgrade attempt from Windows 10 to Windows 11 ended in a Bluescreen. (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP)
 Because we had other project ongoing we have waited until Windows 11 22H2. Maybe the problem was solved in this release but we had the same issue. Both scenarios upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 22H2 and upgrade Windows 11 21H2 to 22H2.
 After this bad experience we created a case at the HP Support. After some troubleshooting and sending them our logs we have found the issue.
 It's the Synaptics touchpad driver. 
 When we remove the driver the upgrade is working fine. Now we wait for a response from HP if they will release a fixed driver.
 I will update this post when i receive some new information.

 we need a mail service like mailjet to do bulkmail.
 I would like to avoid using our primary domain for this, or set up a 2nd DKIM and SPF to coexist with our primary mail system, due to "i have a bad feeling about this".
 I guess because i don't want to jeopardize domain reputation, risk being blacklisted, or deal with the consequences of the mailservice being compromised. 
 Which is why i proposed to buy a new domain, with one or two mail accounts attached to it, for bulk mails only, without interfering with other productive mail services.
 A follow up question to this was:
 Would protective services like Microsofts Defender P1 or P2 (or other vendors) recognize those massmails as Phishing or Impersonation? Because there will be <a href> links and images within the body that point towards our primary domain, while the sender address would be from the new domain.
 I don't think that's the case, but since i'm stuck in the overthinking game now, i'm not so sure anymore. Anyone had to deal with this before?

 https://www.reddit.com/r/gpg4win/comments/y0y28b/command_line_encryptiondecryption/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 
 Hi, I'm relatively new to gpg4win, and am trying to accomplish what I *think* is a relatively simple task.
 I'd like to encrypt and decrypt files from a command line, such that I can script a process to automatically parse files in a folder to be encrypted at regular intervals, or decrypted. I have only one certificate with private key stored in Kleopatra, and it's set to my default identity, and "ultimate" trusted.
 I've googled for hours, read through documentation, found examples, but a few of the option switches that are widely referenced don't seem to work with gpg4win (IE, --passphrase-file or --passphrase_fl, or even just --passphrase).
 Here's my current syntax for a test encryption
 .\gpg -r "KEYNAME" -o testencrypt.gpg --pinentry-mode=loopback --passphrase "PASSPHRASE" --default-recipient-self --always-trust -encrypt test.txt
 yeilds :
 gpg: ypt: skipped: No public keygpg: test.txt: encryption failed: No public key
 I'm not sure if I even need the passphrase for encryption, rather than decryption - but if I omit --passphrase, it prompts for one.
 I haven't gotten to decryption syntax, but figure it will be pretty much just the opposite process. I noticed the gpg-preset-passphrase.exe program, and ran it and entered the password there - not sure if that impacts anything.
 Thanks for any insight!
 edit : using gpg4win 4.0.3

 Our plan is...
  
Use GPO to redirect our user folders (Desktop, Documents etc) to a windows file share using the in-built offline files feature.
 The share will be hosted on DFS and replicated between fileservers across regions.
 Configure folder quotas to prevent users running riot with local files
  
Does this sound like a bad idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow IT peeps, 
 First question was : https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y06smj/sysadminsoftware_enginners_is_this_normal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
 I got another question, as i am wondering if this is a common practice which i have not experinced as i feel that it is a bad pratice, or am i wrong, 
 So for example, Customer creates a ticket, ticket gets assigned to wtv team i.e. Hardware team. Hardware team resolves the issues, comments on the ticket saying issue has been resolved, can we proceed to close the ticket, customer comments back about a quey on something that is not related the issue i.e. warranty status of the HD which we have to email the OEM and await their reply. Which will extend the SLA even though the main issue has been resolved. 
 Do you get the customer to create a new ticket or keep the ticket open?
 For me i think it is a bad practice to keep the ticket open, from my experience usually we'd get the customer to create a new ticket. 
 But then again, back then i was working for companies had some of control i.e. HPE, big IT corps. 
 But the new company i just joined, i am still getting used to the practice, and i was wondering if i should address this as this might give the customer too much power to dictate and of course my previous question
 I find such practices bad and is making things very confusing which in turn would reduce productivity.
 ​
 Am i wrong?
 Or should i address this? 
 I dont wanan address something that would shoot myself in the foot

We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

The two commands both accept every VLAN configured on the switch on the trunk ports. So my question is, if there are any disadvantages for network, when the trunks are configured in that way instead of specifying the exact VLANs. We have some delays and higher TTLs in our network and/or some black magic we can't figure out. So my boss hat the opinion its caused by the trunk all command. Is that true? We are talking about a VLAN configuration of 20-30 VLANs.

 Today, something odd happened. We noticed that old users account that were once deleted now appeared back in AD. To add to this, a bunch of users that were removed from security groups for licensing purposes, were also suddenly added back to those sec groups. The MSP had dropped the ball on doing back ups for the last few months and we noticed a couple weeks ago and they have been working to get their crap together. So they have been in and out of the network working on this. 
 I’m not entirely sure what happened and why Active Directory suddenly looks like old stuff is there and/or reverted in some way or idk, cause it’s not reverted in its entirety. 
 What are some events or things I can look at in AD to help determined what happened here???

 But if I access the account tab in ADUC, I still see the "user must change password at logon" box is ticked.
 If I untick and ok, I get that access is denied.
 ​
 what I've done thus far,
 I've created an OU, put some users in it and created a group to whom I'd like to delegate the permissions of change, reset password, read and write lockout time, read-write pwd last reset
 I've also added read and write user account control, but I'm not having any luck.

 Your help would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 Just trying to get a client up with Starlink - we are using tunnels to deliver their public IP and starlink as a backhaul - this all works fine.
 Deployment testing internally - we just setup a dhcp server and added routes based on DHCP like so:
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 dhcp 100
 And a few other routes back to management IP's in case of tunnel issues
 ip route 1.2.3.4 255.255.255.255 dhcp 100
 This worked in testing with normal DHCP server, but what we've found since deploying is that starlink's IPoE doesn't deliver a default route via the 'dhcp' keyword - i.e. DHCP Option 3 (I believe) and is instead providing the default static route via classless routes (option 121) ?
 The big tell is that a default route is there, but its 254 distance instead of the configured 100, and the /32 routes we added do not get picked up.
 So my question is thus - given we can not get that gateway using the 'dhcp' keyword on the routes, is there any way to kind of add a route for the /32's based on the default route given out in what we assume is option 121?
 I am remote to the site, so can't really reliably debug DHCP without kicking my access off, so any help is appreciated to understand my options.
 Thanks!

 Just a quick sanity check, I have vm console access, I couldn't have chosen 'shutdown without updates' without credentials, correct?
 My other choice would have been to have them shut it down from inside OS, and patch when it came up instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Having a bit of a problem driving me nuts and hoping someone can lend a bone.
 I've done a similiar setup before and never had any trouble.
 I have two physical sites with an ESX host in each. All networking machines are inside of ESX. There is a virtual firewall at each site. The two have a Site2Site VTI (Route based) VPN Tunnel between them. Over it I'm sending VXLan traffic. The VxLan endpoint is behind each of the firewalls, running OpnSense in another VM. No NAT going on inside the VTI. Subnet to subnet. VxLan link is established and I have a stretched layer 2 segment with the IP range of 10.20.171.0/24. I can ping across it. I can browse http across it. But the second I swap the same test/set of ips for https - I'm unable to browse. In other words, I believed that it is a TLS problem. curl -k -vvv showed it hanging on "Client Hello".
 ​
 Using the same http host I succeeded with but https did not work with, I did a client side wireshark twice:
  
On Net
 Across VxLink
  
For #1, it worked (ie: the vms live next to each other on the same time).
 For #2, last thing client sends is a tls "client hello" and never receives the server hello back.
 I did another wire shark on the server side, and the server hello IS being sent back, just not arriving at back at the client. OVER THE SAME LINK that plain old http (stateful) and icmp work.
 I'm absolutely dizzy trying to chase the packets for that particular conversation at this stage. 
 Can anyone think of anything?

This is a brownfield deployment, so we have lots of workloads that are already talking to each other and we need to do some kind of discovery to determine what's talking to what on what ports.
 VMware's solution is to pay a lot of money for vRealize Network Insight. I'm balking partly on the cost and partly on the principle of the thing.... lots of firewall products have this visibility for no extra cost once you buy the product.
 Anyone have suggestions for alternative approaches?

When working with the vendor, their recommendation is to turn this off or make our customers who are receiving these emails whitelist the vendors domain. For 7000 different customers this seems pretty unreasonable. I have been asked to give our management options on what to do. Here is what I have so far. 
 1) move systems to a different account receivable software that will sending information 
 2) email all customers to whitelist the domain
 3) turn off DMARC quarantine option.

 Personally I don't think 3 is an option but my direct manager wanted it there. I am leaning strongly towards 1 if the vendor cannot find a way to sending this in a secure fashion. Any helpful tips?

 We’re having an issue where some of the new workstations getting connected to the fex’s, their MAC address shows up in the table as a static mac being learned over the vPC peer link. It’s the same on both Nexuses, they both think they’re learning it from the other device. We can’t clear it out of the mac table because it’s a static (it will only let you clear dynamic), and when checking the running config on both devices there are no static MAC’s assigned to any interfaces. 
 Has anyone seen this issue before, or found a resolution? 
 TLDR: both our nexuses think they’re learning a static mac from the other side via the vPC peer link, but there is no static mac configured.

We currently have WAN links (fiber LES) to the building but the connection is sometimes problematic, and only 1gbit when its working at its best. We are going to be moving our entire office to the building so to ease this transition we want to link back to the original office with the fastest link we can reasonably set up without spending mad amounts of cash.
 We have looked at possibly using the Unifi UBB-XG https://dl.ui.com/ds/ubb-xg_ds.pdf But its not clear if this is encrypted and/or secure. Regular raw wifi isnt an option in our setup, and laying a VPN over the top means a lot of reconfiguration of routing etc. Ideally we want to extend our broadcast domain over the wifi (not ideal but its only short term) to avoid having to reconfigure all the equipment. Also the speed appears to only be ~6gbit on a good day, despite it having 10gbit SPF+ ports.
 Can anyone suggest a better option? Preferably someone with some experiential knowledge.

 We want to use 802.1x on all access switch ports, the problem is that we use different vlans for difference devices. So printers in VLAN20, clients in VLAN10 etcetera. I want to somehow push the VLAN through authorization policies so that users can move printers without having them stop functioning.
 I want to know what we can do about this in an event where the ISE goes down completely. I know that you can revert to a specified VLAN if the radius server goes dead. But I want that for every VLAN we use. 
 Is that even possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We're considering to buy few new DC Internet Edge routers, we need them just for routing, no need MPLS or segment routing, or other 'fancy' features, currently we're using Cisco NCS-5501-SE. But it has only 4x100G ports, which is not sufficient. So we started to look to other options:
 Cisco NCS55A1-24H - it has 24x100G, but limited scale - supports only ~2.2millions of prefixes. The maximum could be reached in a few next years. So this is not very good. Filter all /24 prefixes would be a workaround for future, but it could bring some new un expected problems, so we're looking very carefully to this.
 Cisco NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S - It has 36x100G with Extended scale for prefixes - support 4millions of prefixes, but seems too expensive.
 Maybe you know so other models would be not so expensive as NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S ? Maybe something from Juniper series ? I think every DC operator with quite much internet traffic are having similar head ache these days. Any advices ? Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had this discussion and it reminded me that I wanted to raise this point here.
 My current team lead gifted me with this concept - the turd system. A 'turd' is a task that shouldn't exist, doesn't make sense to exist in its current form, and is a pain in the ass to handle, especially in bulk. Turds tends to naturally accumulate into heaps of shit, until either some poor responsible souls goes shovel them, or they get stomped down the drain.
 My team lead is of the firm beliefs that it's a good thing for turds to accumulate, as this triggers the 'turd system' - someone eventually complains that the turds aren't being passed in a timely fashion, and after a few iterations this provides the impetus to restructure or remove the task so as to eliminate the source of turds.
 This strikes me as something that is typical of organizations in general. Dumb shit creates work no one wants to do it, least of all the people who realize it's pointless. If someone handles it, that process never gets reviewed. However, if it's left to break, then eventually decision-makers will resign themselves to changing the process.
 Does your shop have a turd system too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Testing an FPR-1010 with FMCv and would like come clarification on the access control policy.
 Normally a firewall with stateful inspection allows outbound traffic to return unless explicitly denied.
 I have a policy configured with the following rules:
 Mandatory
  
Log all connections - Monitor only
 Allow specific applications
 Block 'very high risk' applications.
 Geoblocking rule
  
Default
  
Allow traffic inside zone to outside zone and inspect.
  
Default Action: Access Control: Block all traffic.
 However, most return traffic is still being blocked on the outside ingress.
 What is the proper way to configure such a policy for a perimeter FPR?

 We are building a collapsed core topology with our 4 sites (30m apart from eachother)
 The site in the middle has two HA firewalls and each site will have a ring design in the access layer. Each site will also have a l3 switch for inter-vlan routing, connected to the firewall in the middle.
 I am wondering if the l3 switches are even needed since the routing between vlans could be accomplished directly via the firewalls?

I think it's better that I disable It for everyone and fix everyone that can't log in yet, so I'll have the next 3 months to think about a solution and re-enable before Jan 2023 Can you guys help me here? Extra info: OS-W7, Office 2013, I already tried to disable and re-enable modern auth, create/change the 3 Registry keys that Microsoft said that were needed in order to modern auth work, delete credencials from windows control panel, change passwords.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time configuring MFA on an AzureAD tenant. I'm having two issues currently.
  
AzureAD > Security > Identity Protection > Multifactor Authentication Registration policy
  
This is not configurable, all of the options are grayed out (I'm signed in with a Global admin account). Not sure why I can't edit anything, the default policy does not let me change the assigned users/groups, all grayed out.
 
 
Using a conditional access policy seems to work, forced my account to sign out and register a phone number (also had phone call and the app as options).
  
When I go into the test user's Azure Profile > Authentication Methods, it's empty. When I worked a support role, I'd see the registered phone number there which could be cleared, or changed. Has this been moved? The "new" menu (blue ribbon at the top stating the "new authentication experience) doesn't have anything either
 
I also can't seem to specify methods, I'd like to remove phone call as an option, and possibly remove text as well to force the authenticator app, as I've come to understand text is rather not secure, and the authenticator app seems to be generally regarded as a good method. Would this be done through the menu I mentioned in the first issue, the registration policy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[External email tagging has been available in OWA, Outlook mobile, and Outlook for Mac since 2021. The most awaited support for "Outlook for Windows" is available now.
 In phishing attacks, attackers send emails pretending to be trusted persons or organizations. To prevent users from clicking malicious links and attachments sent by external users, admins can enable an external email warning tag in Outlook. It helps Outlook users handle those emails with extra attention. 
 Now admins can switch from the transport rule as it has few disadvantages,
  
It takes up a lot of space in the subject line, making it hard to preview the subject.
 As the transport rule might not be aware of the end user’s language, it leads to localization issues.
 Multiple external tags: If the external users keep replying to the thread, it will add multiple [External] tags in the subject.
 When you reply to the external email, they won't get any clue that you have enabled external tagging.
  
Admins can enable it through PowerShell. Start enabling external email tagging to alert users, irrespective of device usage.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xxy1hl/apply_this_new_phishingresistant_mfa_setting_to/
 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

 https://fkeep.io/imgs/i/ptbR.jpg
 ​
 Basically, I want the vouchers to be usable up to X HOURS based on actual use and not when the voucher was activated (which forces the user to use it up all the moment it's activated).
 Say user one is issued an 8 hour voucher
 User can use it for a total of 8 hours worth meaning that the user can disconnect from portal when he's done browsing online for the moment, in order to have more time to browser online later.
 In the future, I would also need to generate some vouchers that will expire based on when it was first activated (used).
 But basically, I can't tell which is which.

 I like to use windows terminal, and I like it to default to wsl when opening. 
 But I'm using winget more and more, and so I also would like to have a different shortcut that will open windows terminal directly in power shell. To achieve so I've created a shortcut with parameters like so:
 "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_1.15.2524.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\wt.exe" -p "Windows PowerShell" 
 As you can see the path to windows terminal executable will change at every new update, breaking my shortcut. Taking the time to fix the shortcut every time is not worth the hassle.
 Do anyone knows how to create a dynamic shortcut that will handle the continuous change in the path? I was thinking something like this:
 "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_*\wt.exe" -p "Windows PowerShell" 
 But of course it will not work

 For this I have to create a basic test environment for students to use, and it's currently open if it's going to be a few nodes inside Virtualbox that the student runs locally, or a school-hosted Eve-NG virtualization environment. I think that besides the basic SNMP theory, I will give some Net-SNMP examples first and then dig into an NMS.
 My instructor has given me two NMSs to choose from: Nagios core and Zenoss core.
 Which NMS would be better to use for creating lab exercises, which are intended to give a basic concept of network management. Should I even pick one or rather use both?
 I have Nagios Cookbook and Zenoss Core Network and system Administration as my source material for both NMSs.

 A plus would be also something that can create or manage a mass mail for every group, I.E., got a problem with one thing, i can mass mail everyone who has that system.

 I have two routers: one for internet access, and other other is an LTE router for accessing a specialized service.
 There is no LAN infrastructure so am thinking of bridging the two wifis into one by making one behave like a switch.
 or turn one into a switch and connect it to the second router via lan cable. (with the process, i think i wont be able to access the services of both routers.
 Or i can get a third old router, turn it into a switch and connect the two routers to it. AM not sure if the 3rd rout/switch would be able to broadcast a wifi with the two wifis merged.
 Is it possible to do so or to do routing in a router/switch?
 ​
 its a thought experiment. Glad for any suggestions

 Can you please help clarify following doubts?
  
In OSPF, While forwarding a received Type5 LSA to other area, why does the ABR not change the Advertising Router IP of the Type 5 LSA to it's own IP? What is te basic reason behind this? If ABR is able to change the Advertising Router's IP in the Type5 LSA, then there was no need of Type 4 LSA which meant less OSPF overhead on the network.
 BGP Split Horizon Rule says, "Don't advertise IBGP learned routes to another IBGP peer." The purpose is to avoide loop because as per standard, it is assumed that all of the IBGP Peers will be on full mesh connectivity. - What is the reason that the BGP Protocol designers made this standard assumption?
 Why is does the Route Reflector not change the next hop IP while advertising an IBGP learned route to client? I am trying to understand what made the BGP designers decide for RR to not change the next Hop IP for IBGP learned routes?
 What is the reason due to which BGP designers did not consider EBGP router to automatically change Next Hop IP for EBGP learned routes while advertising towards IBGP Peers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 I'm hoping someone can shed some light before I go a little crazy.
 I know others have also had this problem as I've seen threads, but everyones is slightly different.
 2019 environment running RDS (With FSLogix) (Hosted in a DC)
 365 Apps for Enterprise - Shared License (E3)
 Back in May/June - all users received an activation issue - office wouldn't activate at all
 Microsoft pushed me around, placing registries keys like EnableADAL and DisableADALatopWAMOverride then it started to work but I didn't really want to use either of these keys long term... I was also advised to use: AlwaysUseMSOAuthForAutoDiscover=1 but I haven't removed this key as of yet.
 We continued to have problems for the months with Activation (not licensed) or 'these set of folders can't be opened'
 The main fix after a lot of research seemed to have been the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin was missing/corrupted. I've been able to mostly fix this with a logon script that checks + reinstall with the following:
 if (-not (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin)) { Add-AppxPackage -Register "$env:windir\SystemApps\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\Appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode -ForceApplicationShutdown } Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin 
 For the most part, this script has fixed the daily problems but occasionally, for different people, randomly when they logon in the morning, they won't be able to open Outlook as it'll say 'these set of folders can't be opened' - AAD BrokerPlugin is installed and the main fix is to open Word, go to File > Accounts > Sign out and then sign straight back in. You can then open Outlook straight away - it's a frustrating little resolution.
 Has this else experienced this too? Anyone able to provide some insight or suggestions for a final fix?
 Thanks!

 A the moment firewall port 25, 80 and 443 are still forwarded to our on prem mailserver. 
 The purpose of migrating to exchange online was to avoid the vulnerabilities of exchange on prem.

 Do the ports still need to be forwarded? I read that some are necessary for AD connect?

 We're taking part in this years Gone Phishing Tournament and have gone through the setup process as instructed. The test email came through, bypassing the mail server filters and I uploaded a list of all users as instructed.
 This morning, I get an email from an end user saying they had received an email over the weekend about a "Gone Phishing Tournament". It appears they have been sent the same initial setup instructions that I received in September. A quick message trace shows that everyone in the company has received the same setup email! So now this tournament is no longer a surprise to anyone and has basically been ruined.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few days ago, we discussed the newly -released grant control that helps us to apply phishing-resistant MFA.https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xxy1hl/apply_this_new_phishingresistant_mfa_setting_to/
 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

 I've got a few logical networks at the office. Internal LAN/Ethernet, Phones/VOIP, Internal Wifi, Guest Wifi, pretty basic). For the network equipment I have a firewall/router appliance, two managed switches, and three wireless access points. 
 Should I have one interface port on the Firewall appliance configured as a trunk for each of the logical networks setup as VLANs? Or would splitting wired and wireless device types into their own switches, each connected to a dedicated interface on the appliance be the better choice?
 What are the pros & cons, and which would give me better or worse performance? Is either approach sound?

We have several (like 10) synology NAS devices in the network for our backup solution. Veeam backs up to these devices. Can anyone give me a good reason these are not ready for enterprise setup? To me they are just a solution thats not really expensive, but maybe not the ideal solution. 
 I have had a 3rd party in our stuff saying X is wrong or Y is wrong and so far its been things that are not actually a big deal. Example: They complained about the m.2 drives the NAS uses as not being enterprise. (The m.2 is simply a cache drive). They have also been looking at the network side of things and making, honestly dumb suggestions. Dumb as in replacing our backbone with a different manufacturer for network hardware.

 I have some questions I want to ask. The hosts are going to have 2x1G and 2x10G nics with the 10G being used for storage. 
 I'm trying to figure out what TOR switch I should use. I'm also trying to figure out if I should do all the routing on the TOR switch and even do the bgp sessions on said switch or should I just trunk the uplink to its own router and a firewall behind it. I have a xeon d host where I was planning on virtualizing most network functions.
 I'm probably not going to be able to afford any brand new high end switch so used switch recommendations are highly welcome.

 Basically in one of our servers We got an alert about the CMOS battery
 I contacted IBM with the logs and they sent me a CMOS battery
 I managed to finally remove the old CMOS battery and insert this new one 
 However the CMOS battery bay holder is lose
 The CMOS battery bay in the server 
 ibm 3550 m5 
 Sits like this 
 https://i.postimg.cc/5053cmm0/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-23-48-027-edit-com-android-chrome.jpg
 And the CMOS battery bay that seems lose has these plastic things as shown below
 https://i.postimg.cc/gkjv4p1r/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-15-52-984-edit-com-miui-gallery.jpg
 that holds it ( it is NOT soldered to the board ) when I was trying to clip off the last battery I may have losened it
 Now when I plugged the new battery in the IBM server ImM console gives the same error saying something about a faulty battery so my questions are
 @ the server boots up and is functional without any noises and when the new CMOS battery was inserted it changed the IBM IMM time date to 1999 - does this mean anything ?
 @ also do I have to replace the whole motherboard or the CMOS battery being lose could it be a problem ? I mean it's placed fine - or could I tighten it from the back ? 
 @ does anyone know what the problem is ?
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I have some networking knowledge and experience, but I am still growing my skills and advancing my career. 
 I was thinking about how layer 3 switching for interVLAN routing is more efficient and quicker due to the ASICs and such for routing traffic between VLANs compared to a standard firewall with inspection and such. But layer 3 switching ACLs are very basic and doesn't allow any sort of traffic inspection/analysis. 
 Firewalls have all the great security features for traffic inspection and analysis, but can the bottleneck/slower for interVLAN routing to internal systems.
 One scenario I can think of is; lets say you have a media department (10+ people) that works with a lot of large files and directly edits off a network share through a 10gb link connected to their desktops. Using a firewall to separate the server network and their desktop network (as well as all the other standard user networks) may be the bottleneck when it comes to those connections but more secure for internal threats. Layer 3 switching would be faster, but way less security to defend against internal threats as well as more complicated to maintain with ACLs the larger the distribution layer grows. Or is this just a money problem and a beefier firewall should be purchased to handle something like this?
 I guess the question is, at what point do you choose firewall or layer 3 switch for interVLAN routing and ensuring the network is properly secure and why?

 I already tried all the tools that Google recommend for migrating from O365 but NONE of them worked and the documentation is DOG SHIT. The only way I was able to migrate a mailbox (test mail) was manual process by making a content search on O365 and uploading the PST file to Gmail. I need to automate the migration and I am now thinking if I should rather just create my own migrating tool with powershell/C# and use Google/Graph REST apis... but that could potentially scale the price 3 times the initial budget.
 Has anyone here migrated from O365 to Google workspace (Gmail primarily)? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 while https://www.leagueoflegends.com works perfectly and is their main page, if you go to https://leagueoflegends.com which should redirect you, you receive an SSL Error.
 Small blunder but that happens during "Worlds" their biggest tournament and I would love to see if the click rate dropped since the cert got invalidated (yesterday).
 Happens to all of us, so monitor your stuff and try to always have documentation for these changes in order to not forget some .conf files!

 So, I will need your help on this one.
 I have users that work on company laptops (ad-joined), they log in using their AD credentials as Standard Users.
 When they work from home, they connect to the company VPN. However, if they won't connect to VPN, their credentials are cached on the laptop so they can still log in to their account.
 Sometimes, let's assume that the VPN connection is broken, I want to remotely configure a setting or two (via Anydesk) using a local administrator account without being connected to the VPN. Not being connected to VPN means that I cannot grant a user local admin rights to overcome this.
 How can I configure a local admin account (maybe with cached creds) so that I can still support these remote users? Actually, what I am asking is the best practice covering both security and ease of access, how are you guys implementing a similar case?
 I should mention that we are not using LAPS or any other Endpoint Privilege Management software, we are considering this scenario though.

 My company has recently decided to take on a new project. There are going to be around 130 dorm rooms, all of which are going to need a private (Isolated) network.
 Our networking team are planning to just YEET 150 VLANs in a switch stack and hook each VLAN up to their own dorm.
 The question:
 Is there a better way to achieve the same result? This way feels outdated, but I can't seem to think of a better answer.
 Thanks in advance.

 ls of my users root directly would hang until ctrl+c
 tab autocomplete when used in home directory would hang and lock up the shell
 other random issues which turned out to be things trying to look in the home directory 
 turns out its the windows 11 RDP bug causing an issue with XRDP and the thinclient_drives directory causes this unusual behaviour. 
 disabling the UDP part of the rdp client on the windows box solves the issue.
 more info on the issue that seems to cause this behaviour here:
 https://pureinfotech.com/windows-11-22h2-bug-remote-desktop/ 
 there may be a way to block the issue server side too but I havent looked
 this had me going around in circles for a bit as linking "ls" not working on linux server to a windows rdp client problem was unexpected... 
 although probably an edge case of using rdp to connect to a linux box I figured I would drop this here just in case someone is pulling their hair out.

 From what I’ve been told for the rollout the open gear has cellular connectivity and will run an IPSec tunnel back to the DC. Now, in my mind that means we’ll have 500+ IPSec tunnels terminating on the firewall. That’s a heck of a lot of tunnels, is this a typical deployment for OpenGear or is there a better way I’m just not seeing?

 for example, let's say that I deployed the X firewall in the Y company or I configured a VPN between the main site and the secondary site how can I quantify and measure the added value/impact for these projects? if we take let's say a digital marketing agent he can just say that he did the X marketing campaign that increased traffic by Y% to the client's website or increased sales by Z amount, i cant figure out how to have a similar take for network engineering?

 My general question is this: When should I generally start looking at migrating over to the sysadmin side?
 I always find it hard to determine when to move up due to the incessant voice in the back of my head telling me I don't know enough yet. Basically just looking to get outside opinions on if its time to move onwards and upwards. 
 My experience is as follows:
 3 years government contractor service desk
 2.5 years MSP work as a "engineer" but still basically a t2 service desk that handled everything that could be remotely done
 Currently at a top backup solutions company as a support engineer for about a year
 Salary is around 65k currently so im only slightly lower than the sys admin range already for my area
 Certs:
 Windows operation system fundamentals
 Fortinet NSE 1-3
 Cloud +
 Could pass Security+ in about a week or 2 
 Any opinions helpful and feel free to remove if this isnt the right place for this but just looking for some help!

 Have read items about GPOs, but so far I've found no GPO affecting wireless settings that would block miracast (allow creation of public profiles, uncheck "don't allow wifi-direct groups")
 ​
 Tried a brand new pc and installed to it the web proxy, antivirus, firewalls, etc.. and it still seems to connect fine. So something to the other pcs is causing the connection to block but can't pin point anything.
 ​
 Checked on Event viewer, wlan autoconfig log and I do see it starts and connects and then stops it, but nothing telling anything as to why it's doing it.
 ​
 Anybody ran into anything similar?

 Company just built new state of the art facilities with lots of TVs and well this will look terribly on me unable to cast laptop display on these screens. I've put HDMI on some, but I know it's just convenient to do the miracast.

 Tried an HDMI wireless transmitter, that works, but image quality sucks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In packet-switching networks, there exist four types of delays:
  
Processing delay
 Queuing delay
 Propagation delay
 Transmission delay
  
Are these delays due to the implementation of the store-and-forward flow control?
 And if another flow control (like cut-through switching or worm-hole switching) doesn't that affect these kinds of latency?
 For example (according to my understanding) in cut-through switching the processing delay is almost eliminated if not at all.

I was chatting with him via text to say hi and asking him about the job, etc. He mentioned they don't use NAT and that all the devices are assigned public IPs, which he also said are all behind a firewall. I replied with concern and confusion and he just said that the college was issued a /16 block back in the early Internet days and that they've just been using those. We didn't really chat much more but I was wondering about this. 
 Wouldn't this be a massive security concern as well as a massive waste of public IP addresses? Also, how would you be behind a firewall and also be using public IPs without NAT unless your router/firewall was right at the ISP level? 
 I'm assuming I'm missing something here so I figured I'd ask for some insight in this sub.

 I do not see the need for these roles to be added to the service account to remove another point of attack but unsure of any repercussions that may happen if removed.

 As far as I see all the service account needs is to have the owner role for the Azure stuff that is separate from administrating anything related to AD Azure or O365 but want a second thought.

Don't they just turn up an additional lambda on a link to deliver more bandwidth from their Datacenters \ Edge centers to the ISP exchange? 
 I am assuming they are using 10 of the 16 lambdas that their gear has available, and they just need to increase to the 11th lambda, and there is no cost for that incremental lambda.
 Obviously when they need to bring up an additional fiber link, and activate a full port and pay the full freight for that link.

I measure the network convergence time (not in the event of a failure, but in what time from the moment of starting the network the convergence is achieved, of course, excluding the times of starting the router) and the lower time results are achieved by IS-IS. I can't understand why this is happening, because to my knowledge both protocols calculate the route with the same SPF algorithm, and in the point-to-point setting both skip the DR/BDR and DIS selection step. Research is done on the same equipment, repeated many times, the trend is always the same. Could someone explain where the better result for IS-IS might be coming from?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I apologize if this post is against the rules. I'm not asking for support. I'm wanting to either confirm or deny a perception I've made.
 It seems like Windows can occasionally become erratic in small ways until I install pending updates. This can be anything from weirdness with a mouse being difficult to control to losing internet connection on a single machine seemingly at random. Other devices are fine. What has me pointing to Windows updates specifically is that even though my apps, test pings, etc. all return error responses Windows update can sure as shit download updates and install them no problem.
 These usually go away with the handy dandy restart as well (even if I don't install the updates yet) but crop up soon again before long. I've noticed this for years and ran into it again today (the no internet issue specifically) and finally thought to ask. Between these periods my experience is pretty good until they happen again and quite usually there are pending updates. Rinse and repeat. It's not even an every time thing though quite often I am prompt about installing them once I notice the icon. Occasionally when I'm not though is when I've noticed this behavior.
 What gives? Am I mixing correlation/causation? It's hard to imagine Windows having poison pill code to prod users into installing updates, but honestly it wouldn't surprise me either.
 Edit: Thank god I'm not alone. 🙏

 I got it working. For some reason opnsense did not like using only tagged VLANS on an interface. Once I chose and setup one of the VLANS to be untagged, I could setup all others as tagged. 
  
I've been trying to get a little lab setup using two Zyxel GS1900-XX switches. It works fine if using just the main (GS-1900-24) switch. But no go if using a port on the office (GS1900-16) switch. It seems that VLAN 5 (LAB VLAN) is not traversing the link between the two switches (port 24 on main switch & port 15 on office switch), although VLAN 1 does just fine.
 If I plug my laptop into port 5 on the main switch (untagged VLAN 5), it successfully pulls a DHCP address from the VLAN 5 interface on my router connected to the main switch (ports 3-4, LAGG, tagged VLAN 5).
 If I try to plug the laptop into any of the 6 x VLAN 5 ports (ports 1-6, untagged on office switch) it will not pull a DHCP address and cannot ping the VLAN 5 router interface (10.71.17.254) if I set the address manually.
 I am including screenshots of all applicable switch and router settings.
 I would really appreciate any help I could get from you fine people.
 Thank you!

 - SnipeIt-AD-Sync.ps1: Complete script for syncing user information from AD. Syncs the SID to the EmployeeNum field by default for greater flexibility. Supports all fields supported by SnipeitPS, including syncing info about departments, companies, and managers, as well as setting groups. Also supports flagging or deleting users which no longer exist in AD. Should work with minimal changes. Also technically supports updating passwords, it's recommended to use SSO instead.
 - SnipeIt-Asset-Sync.ps1: Script for syncing asset information from previously exported CSV, direct from SCCM via WMI, direct from AD, or direct WMI queries. You will need to set the fields in each function to match whatever you're importing.
 Hopefully the scripts may prove useful in some way. Feel free to build your own syncing solution using parts or all of the API. And while the scripts are currently being used in an enterprise environment without issue, feel free to submit bug reports on github if you encounter any problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I have a Dell M1000e with 4 M630 blades with Intel X710 10Gb network adapters and a single M8024-k in slot A1. I cannot seem to get any of the blades to connect at 10Gb/s, they all negotiate to 1Gb/s.
 I have one blade running Ubuntu Server 20.04, and three running Windows Server 2019. None of them will negotiate the 10Gb/s link. The Ubuntu box gives me an option to force the link to 10Gb/s but it loses connection, and the Windows ones provide no configuration for it.
 I have also tried forcing the connected switch ports to 10Gb/s for the blades (also tested with forcing it on the Ubuntu blade) to no avail.
 The M1000e has the v1.1 midplane, the switch has been upgraded to the latest firmware, and I've installed the latest intel drivers on the windows blades.
 I also have another 10Gb/s switch and a 10Gb/s NAS plugged in to the external SFP+ ports and both of those negotiate 10Gb/s without issue.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

 We’re managing Chrome updates via Intune policy (the old method with OMA-URI components). Found that several user groups weren’t being governed by this policy and added them. Now I’m potentially in some dire straits…
 Some users who had newer versions than what we needed to use had their Chrome installs rolled back to the assigned version. When this happened, is basically reset the browser to zero - all bookmarks, passwords, auto fill data, etc. is gone. I verified by doing it to my computer that you can restore the data if you were signed into a Google account before the reset (sign back in and turn on sync).
 However, if a user wasn’t signed into a Google account before their browser was reset, does anyone know if there is any way to restore this data short of a full system rollback?

 We struggle to keep a lid on subscriptions and cloud resources for our tiny organization. Large companies (and government!) are probably oversubscribed massively.
 ​
 Since inception, one of the top reasons to "go cloud" was the flexibility of ramping up and down as the business climate dictates. Now many organizations don't even have a handle on their cloud spend. It's going to be almost impossible to cut back on these expenditures.

 I want to prepend text to the subject of messages identified as spam or potentially malicious for ALL incoming emails, but want to only move messages from certain external domains to a user’s Junk Email folder, organization-wide.
 It seems impossible to both move items to the Junk Email folder AND prepend the subject, in general. 
 Is there any possible creative way to achieve this?

Recently, when starting the computer do not get into the network. Only some do not find the network. And it may be that this does not occur every day. We have a DHCP server which distributes the IP addresses. Sometimes computers just don't get an IP address and they get a default IP and are not in the domain because they can't find the DNS and DHCP server. The workaround is when you unplug the network cable and plug it back in or turn the PC off and on again. Both does not always work and you have to test which variant works. Of the 250 computers, not always the same computers are affected, but different ones. Now my consideration is to give each computer a fixed IP address, there is otherwise no solution. Is it usual with a company size to give the computers fixed IP addresses? Or is a DHCP server the better choice? Sorry for my bad english

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a Citrix environment with Server 2019 servers. We would like to have our users Outlook mailboxes indexed and be able to roam this index between the Citrix servers. We use O365/Exchange Online so the mailboxes are in cached mode. We are using Citrix UPM for handling the user profiles, and FSLogix Office Containers for handling the cached ost-files.
 ​
 Everything seems to be working fine, except the fact that the search index for Outlook does not seem to work. We are letting Server 2019 handle the search database - not UPM or FSLogix - as per MS recommendation. We can see that the per-user database (.edb file) is created in the user profiles. However, they do not seem to update and the size of the .edb files never increases from the initial size of 8196 KB. 
 When we look at the indexing status in Outlook, it shows that Outlook is a location that should be indexed, but it also shows that 0 items have been indexed. And it shows that 0 items are still needed to be indexed. 
 On a normal Windows 10 PC with Outlook it shows how many items have been indexed. And I've read somewhere that the size of the per-user database .edb should increase, when indexing large mailboxes. 
 So what is your experience - is it normal that Outlook shows 0 items indexed? To me this indicates that something is not right? And should't the size of the .edb in the user profile increase, when indexing large mailboxes (10-15 GB ost-files)? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 I recently got a used LTO-7 for quite a bargain - almost for free so no hard feelings here.
 Its IBM FC HH drive, connected via FC 8gb qlogic qle2562 to server, put in a BDT Flexstor II (oem tl2000/ts3100/msl2024...) 24 slot library
 The drive however acts a bit strange. When booting up everything is ok, no errors, no faults, no lights...
 The drive passes ITDT health test with all passed. Since i only use lto6 at home i also only tested lto6. Speed it does in health test is 151 mb/s, not full 160, but no failure either.
 I then started full write test. That fails after about 1 hour with EC 6 in ITDT and F3 01 SCD 5 Dtive broken on the library. Wont accept tapes or anything unless powercycled. After powercycle all good.
 What i dont understand is, why does the drive pass health test but fails full write. Both failed ok, but one passed one failed doesnt add up for me.
 Use data: 12/2018 built, 1200 day Power on time, 40 power cycles, 40 cleans so far in lifetime, 3000 catridge loads.
 Newest firmware is installed.
 My first guess due to the high load count is worn out head. But can you really wear out a drive in just 3 years? My other hp drives are 8-10y old and work super fine. Or do you have any other ideas, suggestions, tips?
 If its the head: does anyone have a source for the spare? I am not afraid of a bit DIY, and wont pay 1500 eur to a company to fix it for my home use case (used just for me ar home, have 3 working lto6 drives so i am fine).
 Would be great to find some help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right. So our old manager was let go and I was promoted to technical team lead. I work for an MSP and I'm not exactly sure what a tech lead is required to do. For the most part a big chunk of this job has involved reporting and tracking projects and SLA for the support desk. 
 Any ideas of what a technical team lead is supposed to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm interested in seeing if any other admins are experiencing consistent issues with Cisco AnyConnect in macOS Monterey whether it's a Mac upgrading to macOS Monterey or a new Mac fresh out of the box and provisioned.
 The "Certificate Validation Failure" is hitting our Mac community hard and is a growing issue for us. Certificates are deployed and placed in the System keychain via MDM w/ access to the required cert granted to the AnyConnect VPN client.
 Everything else in our configuration can read and access keychain items without issue but AnyConnect appears to have a really hard time validating the certificate it needs.
 When a user is hit with the cert validation error, they can "fix" it by running "security unlock-keychain" in Terminal and successfully activate VPN on the next attempt.
 Is anyone else dealing with this in macOS Monterey as a consistent issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I guess a question for those who were sys admins at one point and have moved onto other specifically non-management roles?
 How'd you do it and did you choose or was it more of a progression from your previous role?
 I've been working in IT since 1998. I did what I guess was the natural progression of 1st level helpdesk ->desktop support ->sys admin. Made it from my 1st job to sys admin in 2.5 years and aside from a few failed forays into other areas, I've remained a sys admin almost exclusively since early 2001. I had a brief go as a team leader/management and discovered very quickly it was not for me. 
 I've been working project implementations exclusively for 5 years now and do enjoy the work. I tend to become the goto guy fairly quickly on projects (not saying I am perfect or know everything, far from it. I think it's just an age/experience thing and probably happens to everyone who has been around for 20+ years and a lot of the ppl I work with are younger than me)
 I'm curious about infra architecture roles but really don't know what the day to day is like and how to go about moving into that area.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a user who works off site behind a double NAT network. They routinely have issues being able to ping our local subnet which means they can't get to a server they need. They never have issues establishing the tunnel so I don't know why double NAT would come into play. I just noticed the issue while troubleshooting today. It feels more like an issue with their route table on Windows or a corrupted TCP/IP stack? Its weird because they are the only one having this issue as well. Im wondering if the VPN is getting confused, but as far as I know thats only inbound connections.
 Edit: I also want to add that nothing changes with the remote network that I know of and nothing with our local network. Its seemingly random when they can ping the server and when they cant. But, again, never an issue establishing the tunnel.

 What optical cable should I buy and from where ( link please) ? What tools do I need?
 The warehouse varies from 45F to 110F degrees up by the roof. Can the fiber cable span hanging from hooks on the wall about 10ft spans with out damage?
 Thank you in advance:)

Client A: Linux, Northern California, in datacenter (1gbps)
 Client B: MacOS, Northern California, residential (500mbps)
 Server A: Virgina, US (1gbps)
 Server B: London, UK (1gbps)
  
Latency is pretty similar between both clients and servers, but TCP throughput is wildly different:
  
  Server A (Virginia) Server B (London) 
  
 Client A 60ms, 400Mbits/sec 136ms, 180Mbits/sec 
  Client B 68ms, 15Mbits/sec 🔴 140ms, 120Mbits/sec 
 
 I uploaded the raw iperf3 output, as well as mtr reports to server a
 I'm trying to understand why the performance of Client B is so poor to Server A, yet is much better to Server B which is further away.
 What stands out to be from the iperf3 data is:
  
MUCH bigger Cwnd with Client A (6mb vs ~120kb)
 MUCH greater Retr count with Client B
  
Additional info about Client B:
  
Cloudflare speed test shows 550mbps.
 0% packet loss to Server A, reported via `ping -i 0.1 <Server A>` for 60s.

 Any ideas on what might be happening, or how to debug this?

Not really sure what difference it makes but anyway: Is there any windows software that can show me more detailed info about my wireless connection? Looking to see bandwidth assigned for a given channel whether its 40 or 80mhz, and to see if its using any QAM modulation technique? I have a 2x2 wifi-5 interface, and assigned the ap to have 80mhz bandwidth on channel 42 (wifiman app says the bandwidth ranges from channels 34 to 50) but am only getting at most 300mbps. I believe it might be possible for this to be higher, if it were using QAM256, but I don't know how to check this. There is minimal interference with any overlapping signal at -85dB. I am testing using iPerf3 between my laptop and a server. My network card is an intel ax201, and am connecting to a unifi AC Pro. Thanks!

 So recently, there has been packet drops on our network in both internal network and external. Whenever we are downloading a file, the speed will gradually slow down and eventually come to 0 kbps then say it has network issues and stop downloading.
 At first, we isolated the issue to be our ISP. And after some testing from them they said that their radio was misaligned causing the packet drops. They fixed the issue on their end. We tested this by just plugging a computer straight into the router and downloading the same file we've been using as a test. There was no issue with downloading.
 So we tested the download on an access switch and on WiFi to see if the issue lies within the internal network. I plugged a laptop straight into the core switch and tested the download. The issue…]]></summary>

 Am I missing something more obvious, or is it only for special use cases?

 So let me start off by saying I was recently offered a position as a Systems Administrator for a medium sized business with about 100 - 200 employees. Prior to this my only experience was working at a PC and cell phone repair shop. I do have a bachelors in IT, A+, CCNA, SEC+, Project+, LPI Linux Essentials, AWS Cloud Certified and ITIL V4 certifications. But I have like literally 0 help desk experience.
 I don't have much experience besides homelabs. I've never worked in an office IT setting. Frankly, I'm not even sure why they hired me. I have 0 terminal skills. I understand basic networking concepts and I can Google myself through most user-related issues. The pay is 70k in a medium-cost of living area.
 Am I being overpaid? I feel very guilty because my boss is the nicest boss I have ever worked for, and I almost feel like I am scamming them.

 I've worked for small ISPs and all we do is just masquerade list of CGNAT range to a public IP. Example 100.64.0.0/24 to public IP x.x.x.x.
 Whats the difference between the two? How are you configuring CGNAT?
 I came across a comment saying that on CGNAT, we can limit the NAT entries for a user, or even session. I wonder if thats the only difference between the two, whereas normal NAT / masquerade doesnt limit the NAT entries and router will keep on NATting until it ran out of ports.
 When I say normal NAT, in Cisco command: ip nat inside source <source address acl> pool xyz overload

 I'm currently testing AlwaysOn VPN to replace Directaccess.
 It's working well, much much faster than DA.
 ​
 But I have a problem regarding migration in a real world scenario.
 when I deploy VPN configuration to a computer, the AOVPN goes up, and DirectAccess stop connecting (as the computer can join the NLS server)
 but as the DirectAccess GPO still applied, we have conflict with NRPT rules and some services doesn't work
 I can't exclude AOVPN device from DA Policy, because I'm not sure at which moment the device will get is AOVPN configuration up and running 
 If I remove immediatly, the computer will remove is DA configuration without having AOVPN configuration, and the user will loose corporate access
 Due to covid, we have a lot of remote user. and we don't want to have users without connection, having to go to work to repair etc
 Have any of you performed migrations from DA to AOVPN without asking users to come back to the office to have their computer reconfigured by the IT department?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks,
 Hope this helps some people out who need it. I covered the full SC-900 - Microsoft Security, Compliance & Identity Fundamentals course in one video, the editing for this nearly killed me, well not really, it was just a lot of work to make lol.
 Anyway the video is about almost 5 hours long since it covers the whole dang course obviously. With that said, if someone is looking for something specific in the course, it would take them forever to find it so I added a list in the video description with most of the main topics that are covered with time stamps next to each topic.
 The time stamps will make it quicker and easier for people to find what they are looking for if they don't want to watch the whole thing and are just looking for something specific.
 I will be adding a extra video after the course which will have practice questions in it to help prepare for the exam. Now before anyone goes and asks, no, those practice questions are NOT the questions out of the actual official exam, those kinds of questions are against Microsoft's rules and not allowed.
 The practice questions I make will however cover the same topics and measure you on the same skills so they are legal and allowed by Microsoft.
 As I said in the beginning, I hope this helps some of you out since I know what it's like when your boss/company forces you to write an exam and not being able to find any study resources for it.
 Same can be said for folks who can't afford to pay courses or who just can't find anything online. This should plug that hole.
 Below is a short 4-5 min course intro video I made which explains the course. The full course will be in the playlist or you can just go look on the channel, whatever floats your boat:

Example: server1.localdomain.com, server2.localdomain.com, server3.localdomain.com, etc. Some are domain controllers (LDAPS) and some are IIS webservers, among other things.
 I am thinking I should instead purchase a single wildcard certificate for use with all services on my localdomain.com domain. I just don't know how that works from the server / CSR perspective. Like I can make a CSR from server1 but I would have to do the same on the others, but it would be the same certificate. 
 I'm just a little unclear on the best approach. I use DigiCert mainly for 99% of our certs.

 Justin from Blackpoint Cyber here!
 If you're already a Blackpoint Cyber partner you should have gotten this (sorry for the double alert), but if you're not we wanted to make sure it got out to everyone else!
 Blackpoint Cyber is actively monitoring a Fortinet vulnerability involving authentication bypass. Tracked as CVE-2022-40684, users of the following products are vulnerable to attacks:
  
FortiOS: From 7.0.0 to 7.0.6 and from 7.2.0 to 7.2.1
 FortiProxy: From 7.0.0 to 7.0.6 and 7.2.0
  
This vulnerability could lead to remote threat actors logging into unpatched devices and performing operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.
 How to Mitigate:
 Fortinet released security patches on Thursday, October 6th, advising users to do the following:
  
Update vulnerable devices to FortiOS/FortiProxy versions 7.0.7 or 7.2.2., or
 Perform this workaround: Block remote attackers from bypassing authentication and logging into vulnerable FortiGate and FortiProxy deployments by limiting the IP addresses that can reach the administrative interface using a local-in-policy
  
Important: Blackpoint’s SOC has not seen any indicators of compromise in our partners’ environments.
 Blackpoint’s SOC will continue to actively monitor for any indicators of compromise associated with this vulnerability. We are confident that our experienced MDR analysts and technology will continue to protect your business and clients.
 Sincerely,
 Blackpoint Cyber

 Just looking for some advice on what to do. I'll keep this short as I can. 
 I was asked to refresh our storage infrastructure earlier this year. So I gave all of the required information on % growth rates and forecast projects to the supplier who we get hardware from to spec out a new solution. The solution has run out of space only after 6 months of prod usage My boss is fuming and long story short we are buying more storage, however he has said I should have been more vigilant even though they were the ones who used the forecast data to build the under-spec solution and the costs will be coming out of my pay
 Obviously I can't afford the cost of this and don't believe I should be liable for the failed solution. Is there anything I can do or any recourse?

 Maggie commands
 Analysis of the malware revealed that it disguises as an Extended Stored Procedure DLL (“sqlmaggieAntiVirus_64.dll”) that is digitally signed by DEEPSoft Co. Ltd, a company that appears to be based in South Korea.
 Extended Stored Procedure files extend the functionality of SQL queries by using an API that accepts remote user arguments and responds with unstructured data.
 Maggie abuses this technical behavior to enable remote backdoor access with a rich set of 51 commands.
 A report from DCSO CyTec says that the variety of commands supported by Maggie allow querying for system information, executing programs, interacting with files and folders, enabling remote desktop services (TermService), running a SOCKS5 proxy, and setting up port forwarding.
 The attackers can append arguments to these commands, and Maggie even offers usage instructions for the supported arguments in some cases.

 2 - Do I have to create two-way tust between the PDC emulator in both domains ?
 ​
 ​
 ​
 My environment:
 ​
 COMPANY A : We have 4 DC & DNS.
 ​
 DC1 is holding all FSMO roles.
 ​
 C:\Windows\system32>netdom query fsmo
 Schema master dc1.contoso.local
 Domain naming master dc1.contoso.local
 PDC dc1.contoso.local
 RID pool manager dc1.contoso.local
 Infrastructure master dc1.contoso.local
 The command completed successfully.
 ​
 ​
 COMPANY B : We have 4 DC & DNS.
 ​
 DC1 is holding all FSMO roles.
 ​
 C:\Windows\system32>netdom query fsmo
 Schema master dc1.companyB.local
 Domain naming master dc1.companyB.local
 PDC dc1.companyB.local

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not all MFAs are equal!! As we know, we're seeing a spike in multiple MFA attacks like MFA Fatigue on push notification authentication. With all these suspicious MFA attacks, it's been hard to cope.
 Thankfully, Microsoft has finally understood our concerns and provided options to choose different MFA security levels for different users. You can find this newly released grant control "require authentication strength in Microsoft conditional access." Navigate to the path below to find the newly released “require authentication strength” checkbox:
 Azure AD Admin Center --> Azure Active Directory ---> Security (Under Manage Tab) --> Conditional Access.
  
Hereafter, you can opt to allow SMS for base-level workers and implement stronger phishing-resistant MFA for admin & executive accounts.
  
Following a thorough analysis of all authentication methods, Microsoft has categorized three different authentication modes under the grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 
Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 
Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Note: This is still in "preview" mode. Sadly, it won't be available for everyone. Hope it will be rolled out for you soon if you don't see it!

 Stupid question here and Cisco hasn't given me a good answer yet. We're working on migrating about 2000 access points off a Cisco 8540 to a Cisco 9800. We've been using the CSV tool within the Configuration piece in the GUI and importing static tags with the format <mac addr>, <policy-tag>, <site-tag>, <rf-tag>. After we upload the CSV and point the APs to the 9800, they come up perfectly as designed.
 ​
 As we look to move wider chunks of APs, I want to make sure this work is done in advance of moving the APs. Cisco has said there is no way to dump all this IF the AP is not actively on the controller. This doesn't sound right since it's stored somewhere in the controller for when the AP does eventually join. Does anyone know of a way via CLI/GUI/API to dump these "staged" static tags?
 ​

 I can see how some Agile/Kanban/Scrum concepts can help them to be more effective and working as a better team. But I don't want to be that "youngster that wants to change everything and introduce micromanagement". I'm walking on eggs, even if it's a lot of self-inflicted pressure.

 Is there something I can check? Based on the event log, the update was installed yesterday sometime, though I can't tell if the install was user initiated or not (if user initiated, then this makes sense).
 EDIT: Running wmic qfe list shows the update was installed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (while I see updates I know were done manually show domain/username). So doesn't seem user initiated. 
 How do I stop this behavior? This was running hyper-v workloads, and windows still decided to reboot.

 My idea is to configure each pair of ports in a separate VLAN and connect each VLAN to the next VLAN by connecting one port of the VLAN's pair to one of the ports on the next VLAN. The first port and last port of the device are connected to the testing ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have several DNS-Servers in your environment with dedicated servers for internet-resolution and internal servers that forward the external queries to them, there should be no outgoing queries except for the internet-DNS systems. Or at least there should be a concept on how queries move through the network.
 Check your config, esp. regarding forwarding config or internal root-NS and then validate on the firewalls if there's anything that shouldn't be there. 
 We got urgent requests from some customers over the last months where the guys managing DNS got informed (or saw for themselves) that servers contact the internet root-NS that shouldn't do that according to the config, and ofc their reaction covered the spectrum from "btw guys, i found that in the firewall, is this normal?" to "OMG, DID WE GET COMPROMISED!? Please do the needful to mitigate and provide turnaround time for resolution!"
 Turns out, the resolver (the OS-component, not a DNS-Server) on some linux systems regularly checks the Root-NS directly for the trust anchors. Not really critical and can be turned off with 2 commands.
 What i found strange is that it has been like that for several years and only a handful of customers was either paranoid, curious or bored enough to actually notice this so far. 
 So yeah...maybe look into that in advance if you have spare time before somethings pops up during an audit on the firewall and it becomes a high-prio issue.

 I have an strange issue since some time the windows network drives of all Windows10 Client PC´s are disconnecting one or two times a day in the branch offices. On my Servers I don´t have this issue. 
 At first I thought it is an network issue but the connection is fine.
 Does anybody has an tip what I could do? (If possible a tip or trick that can be published via GPO, but i am open for all suggestions!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two devices on the same wifi network can have the same public IP address. So when the router receives a packet, it has to translate the destination public IP address to the private IP of the intended device. This means NAT can only use the port numbers to identify a device on a local network, as well as which port of that device to send the packet to.
 Does this practice reduce the number of available ports that all of the devices combined can use at a time? Because each device can have a maximum of 65,536 ports and for multiple devices, the total number of ports increases with each new device, but the router can support a maximum of 65,536 ports itself.

The system cannot contact a domain controller to service the authentication request. Please try again later.
  
Users can manually enter in their AD credentials, but it’s only a temporary solution. Using the IP for network share works without prompting for credentials, though.
 Uninstalled antivirus, reinstalled LAN adapter drivers, also updated them from manufacturer's site. Installed all latest Windows updates. Disabled Windows firewall briefly, gave PC full internet access.
 nltest /sc_query:PCLAB.com (fake)
 Returns:
  
Flags: 30 HAS_IP HAS_TIMESERV Authentication Service: Netlogon 
 Trusted DC Name \\PCS1-001.PCLAB.COM 
 Trusted DC Connection Status Status = 0 0x0 NERR_Success 
 The command completed successfully

 nltest /dclist:PCLAB.com
 Returns:
  
Cannot DsBind to PCLAB.COM (\\PCS1-001.PCLAB.COM).Status = 2148074320 0x80090350 SEC_E_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED 
 I_NetGetDCList failed: Status = 1231 0x4cf ERROR_NETWORK_UNREACHABLE
  
nslookup works without issues. Disabled IPv6 for ethernet connection, manually configured to use different DNS server IPs as well. Even tried "netsh winsock reset" command.
 I can ping our DC & DNS IPs, disjoined/rejoined to domain without issues. Can recreate this on other Windows 11 PCs that were upgraded. Haven't tried a completely fresh PC yet, though. This was all done on client PCs so far. Not seeing anything in Event Viewer application/server logs on DC servers.
 I'm about at the end of my rope and thinking we should just revert these PCs back to Windows 10. I'd appreciate any helpful advice.

 https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/why-big-tech-shreds-millions-of-storage-devices-it-could-reuse/?comments=1
 They do mention some issues that have happened in the past when companies don't wipe/destroy data properly, either cos they outsource it to people/companies that don't do it properly or because someone got lazy, leading to fines and or lawsuits.
 I've wiped a few drives in my time working in tech and used them elsewhere in the company with an assurance the data is zeroed out but these have always been for internal use within the company. Looking around a bit I had a hard time finding guidance for a good methodology for erasing/wiping drives. Perhaps I'm looking for the wrong terms, or looking at the wrong sources.
 How do you guys do it? Any particular sources you trust that keep current with practices?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got called into a project to install a wireless Point to Point between two buildings at a client. The buildings have fiber, but they want a redundant link to avoid downtime. Apparently there's some upcoming construction and the boss is worried the fiber may get accidentally get cut in construction. 
 I've installed the Ubiquiti Power beam on each building and connected each end to a Cisco switch. I am using the PoE injectors. 
 In the testing phase, the PtP is working fine. The warehouse end comes out of a trunk port on the Cisco Switch, go through a PoE injector, then wireless goes across the parking lot to the admin building and then comes through another PoE injector. 
 If you plug a laptop straight to the injector, it joins you to the LAN. If you put an unmanaged switch on the injector, and then plug in, you're on the LAN. 
 But if you run the injector into the second switch, it doesn't go anywhere. The CLI doesn't even show the port (port 2) as active. 
 What am I missing? I have full access to the switches, but I don't really have a good background of Cisco Training.
 Ideally, I'd like both links to be active, so if the fiber broke, the PtP would keep everything online, and I believe STP would prevent a loop, if activated. 
 If all else fails, it's fine if the PtP stays unplugged from the switch until actually needed. 
 I've tested it both with the fiber plugged and unplugged, and it does not make a difference.

I did a show mac address-table and got the list of MAC addresses that were listed on all the ports, I then fed them into the MAB policy in ISE and successfully was able to MAB the hyper v port but almost all the ports went down and didn’t come back up once I applied MAB and bounced the port and one of them the minute I added the port that was the physical host in the server it went down and would not come back up until I removed all the authentication and tagged it directly into the vlan again with a “switchport access vlan xxx”command. In the end 99% of the ports either wouldn’t come up the minute I applied MAB to the port or went down when I applied MAB to some other port. I can’t imagine it’s not possible to MAB virtual servers and I must just be missing something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy fellow sysadmins! I do some pro-bono consultation work for a small company (15 employees). They don't have significant financial resources, but they're cresting the amount of "random" systems that I can support without some management capability. 
 Setting up an entire active directory domain is extremely cost-prohibitive for them, so I'm looking for solutions. They already have a new Synology NAS, and it appears that Synology's offering for their Directory Server is pretty alright for what I think I need.
 I'm looking for a way to standardize accounts & permissions across their workstations, as well as a way to push group policies to the machines. It looks on the surface that all of this is supported. 
 They currently use a paid Google service for all their email, etc. but I've also thought of Microsoft 365 for them if the juice is worth the squeeze. From what I've been reading, they'd be paying the same price, but I would get all the added benefit of AD features (not all, but the critical ones).
 So, my question is this... 
  
Does anyone here have any experience using Synology's DS offering?
 
What are you using for secondary DNS? I know the primary DNS is recommended to be run on the Synology along with the DS. 
 Currently DNS is on their pfsense, but I wouldn't mind turning that into the secondary if it would support all the weird things needed for DS to work correctly.
 
 Has anyone use the Microsoft 365 offering? Is that worth checking out? How does it handle Group Policy, etc.
  
I'm sure this conversation will evolve, but I'd love to hear folks impressions.
 Full disclosure: For my background, I spent 10 years as a Windows System admin from 2000-2010 and am very comfortable in that environment. I then switched careers into Cyber and now focus on OT, so I've been Linux focused for the last 12 or so. Extremely comfortable in both environments and have been running Linux workstations and servers for 20 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not entirely understanding what the best practice is for managing VLANs, subnets, and broadcast domains is when designing an enterprise LAN. 
 Here's a basic LAN segment to reference throughout this post.
 Across an organization, let's assume that at that a small size site with a single switch has VLAN 69 specified for interfaces connecting to PCs. 
 At a larger site, there will be multiple switches connecting to a central core switch (or switch cluster), which then connected upstream to a router (router-on-a-stick). If I deploy VLAN 69 on both of the access switches, despite them being in different subnets, the trunk links connecting the access switches to the core switch will expand my broadcast domain to include both of these networks. The L3 traffic will be contained to whatever the mask is set to (in this case, the two /24s as shown in the diagram), but the L2 traffic will include all three switches and the LAN-facing router interface. 
 Q: Is it possible to keep the broadcast domain limited to the scope of only the respective /24 networks without having to specify two separate VLAN IDs, or do I have to make one of the switches operate on a different VLAN ID? 
 If separate VLAN IDs are required, how do you best design your VLAN deployments? Do you have ranges of VLAN IDs for specific purposes (i.e. VLAN 60-69 for PCs, VLAN 70-79 for Servers, etc.)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious to hear about others solutions for managing assets aside from the standard laptop and cell phone. I'm talking about printers, monitors, docking stations and any other semi-expensive tech one might deploy. Do you simply slap some type of asset tag on those device? I know there is countless asset management systems, but what about the smaller businesses? Typically, they are understaffed in IT as it is, and hardly pay for the necessities let alone an asset management system. I know there are free options out there, but I can't vouch for helpful those might be. Aside from that, we still have to rely on other people to physically return or ship these devices back, at least this is the case in my role. That's the part I hate, depending on someone else to do their job. How the hell do you make sure so and so returns all the equipment they should have in possession at the end of their employment? I mean printers and monitors don't exactly go back into their boxes nice and neatly if they still even have them. I sure as hell can't depend on an end user to pack things up nice and safely. What about disgruntled terminated employees? They obviously are bitter and are less cooperative. Do you have to get company council involved for them? 
 I know this turned more into a rant as I went on. I just am tired of that sense of searching for needles in a haystack and pulling teeth trying to keep up with tracking tech all over the county.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I’m trying to navigate the world of ruggedized laptops. At the moment my company continues to deploy refurbished Panasonic tough books, and while they’ve been somewhat reliable the fact is that most of these devices are 9 to 11 years old. Even replacing the HDD for a SSD is starting to become problematic as other components of these devices are continuing to fail. Third generation i5’s that have been heavily used aren’t having much fun anymore and I’m not having much fun supporting them at this point. 
 If you currently deploy laptops of these nature, then what is your go to? I know we’re currently paying ~$800 a piece for these older CF-53 laptops from a private refurbisher. There’s been discussion about going back to “standard” laptops for these guys as they aren’t exactly roughing it in the backwoods but I want to present a more current option for a rugged device if possible. Please note that I know they would be perfectly okay with refurbished devices if that isn’t obvious enough.

 The distribution of clients heavily favors 2 APs. One 5Ghz radio had 35; the other had 30. Other APs in the area had 0-10 clients. I have tried adjusting the power levels and will do further tests to try to determine why so many APs are favoring 1-2 5GHz radios when there are 4+ more to choose from in the immediate area. 
 This lecture hall has tables for each row so the clients aren't as densely packed as you're imagining and the APs are evenly distributed overhead. The only way to fit ~100 people in this room is to have an even distribution of bodies in seats. I think that rules out favoring 1-2 radios based on proximity. But I'm no expert
 Load balancing is not enabled on the controller. Does anyone have experience with this feature? I can't find much information on it aside from Cisco saying it will totally work. 
 We do have band-select enabled and that appears to be working. The controller is a 5508 running 8.5.171.0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am just so damn tired of my mail queue filling up with bogus "Geek Squad" invoices. I get very little spam because of fairly aggressive filtering + SpamAssassin on my server. The only things that seem to get through are the damn spams from GMail addresses.
 This last one was for a "Greek Sqaud" renewal that was an image with no text other than "HELLO USER". Complaints fall into a black hole, but they're never from the same address twice, so even if Google did block the user, they're just back using ImaDickweed298 instead of ImaDickweed297.
 There are only a handful of domains that I can't consider putting a blanket ban on, and they're one.

So, the sender is using Gmail for example but lists their name as someone in the company usually an exec's name or as a service such as "IT Admin". 
 Right now I prepend the emails Subject line with "**** WARNING ****" and also include a large yellow box in the message body that says in so many words Caution, External Sender , Fake, Stranger Danger, etc. 
 I understand how a person might breeze past the subject line but the yellow box cannot be missed. At least that's what I thought. I still get folks contacting me asking if emails are legit or not. Their email includes the two prepended warnings but they are still unsure. I am happy everyone is being safe but I thought the warnings make it obvious.
 Again, curious what other people's strategies are for spoofed emails and warning the user base.
 (I would prefer to block them outright but, numerous Execs use personal gmail, yahoo, outlook etc. to email themselves)

 We have a client that was having slow download speeds while on the Global VPN client.

They stated that Microsoft recommended disabling this feature so I gave a try with the client. Sure enough it worked like a charm but I'm trying to understand why this fixed the issue. Maybe I have to do some more digging but was curious if anyone on here happen to know anything about this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, looking for some advice.
 We are moving to a new 9500sq. ft. heavy equipment shop (aprox. 12 bays).
 basic info:
 -ISP will be starlink (remote location)
 -5-15 admin users doing only ERP + google suite(email, drive)
 -big empty warehouse, 115x85ft, 24ft tall. Only obstructions would be actual steel columns and equipment sitting there
 -small 9x20ft drywall office in the middle
 -remote location means IT support will be mostly remote
 -EDIT, forgot to add, 6-10 poe security cameras.
 ​
 Project needs:
 We need a good wifi coverage in the entire warehouse, use will be on the light side. Initially I wanted to avoid running utp cables in my service racks (oil, air, etc) so I wanted to explore a mesh solution that would only require a central node with data plus 4-6 antennas connected to power outlets. Is there a commercial/enterprise mesh wifi that you guys would recommend or instead invest in a switch, running utp cables, and APs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: When you have a duplicate address problem, it's probably because you set things up incorrectly so that there is a duplicate IP on the network. 
 Our order is still trickling in, but I got a few devices so I figured I'd set up a Switch and AP so I can start getting our RADIUS / Eduroam / WPN set up on the AP. 
 Plugged the Meraki into the Cisco 2960S with both sides on a Trunk port. 
 Am able to use multiple VLans on the Meraki. Can see the internet, can ping other VLans. Routing is working fine, DHCP to a new test Server is working fine, and DNS is working fine. 
 The issue is that on the core switch we're getting that error %IP-4-DUPADDR: Duplicate address which is seeing the downlink interface MAC as assigned to the Gateway IP for the Meraki Management VLan, but that Gateway IP is also assigned to the SVI on the Core Switch (Cisco 4500x). 
 You can easily see this by either pinging outside from the Windows Server (Google DNS is the main test IP), but it's the same from the Windows Server to the 4500x (Pure Storage -> Nexus -> 4500x). But pinging from the 4500x to the ASA it fails not at all. 
 I believe that by removing BDPU Guard on the 2960S downlink interface so I could attach the Meraki I should also enable Root Guard on the Meraki to allow BDPU frames to flow down and to not have the Meraki think the uplink interface is the root bridge in its little STP brain. 
 Any assistance would be appreciated.

 Anyone that charges for SSO on their platform is pure BS. We have "Cadillac services" that support it out of the box with no additional "enterprise" licensing scheme. We have products that aren't "tier 1" ranked that support it out of the box.
 And hell we even have Oracle products that support it out of the box... (I mean these are the guys with "If you choose to have a firewall in your organization." in their documentation)
 In my odyssey to centralize authentication these companies have now made the shit list... And the ones that got the balls to charge per user per month... (Keep in mind these aren't the SP)

 For the last 8 years we were using the .exe version of Mikrotik's The Dude for monitoring. But it really is becoming unusable. We constantly rebuilding it after the database corrupts. 
 We have tested Zabbix and Open NMS but we really don't have the resources to self host and maintain. We are considering Open NMS Meridian at this time but was wondering if anyone has any suggestions. It does not need to be free or open source. It also cannot require a PC or some type of equipment onsite to run an agent. 
 The Dude was very simple to use with its ability to build the maps, add separate sites, add notes and add objects. We have not really found anything exactly the same. Anyone know of anything similar? We also use ConnectWise Manage. Integration would be nice but not necessary.

 I have a issue that i can’t seem to solve:
 I have a WDS server running, make boot images and install images. Now i want them to run unattended, i made a answer file and attached it to my test image. But when i PXE boot and select my boot image there is no sign that i uses the unattended file and makes me go through the full setup.
 What could be the issue?
 It should just connect to the server, sign in and run through the setup by itself.
 It seems that the boot image is not using the unattended file.
 Thanks in advance for any help given 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let me start off by saying that I recently started a new job, where I'm trying to implement MDT for imaging. I came from a position where I was using SCCM for imaging, so I'm familiar with Task Sequences, but I'm familiar with SCCM TS, which are a bit different from the MDT. (SCCM provides more options in the TS - More steps that aren't available in vanilla MDT)
 That being said, I've got my TS to install the Operating System, but it won't install applications. If I try to install applications without rebooting, it says that it can't install applications from WinPE, so it's going to reboot. Then it reboots and never finishes the TS.
 From doing some Google searching, it seems that it's the WinRE that performs this step. However, I can't get my TS to boot into WinRE to do that step. When I do the reboot step, it reboots into the main Windows OS, and just finishes the windows setup. The steps after that reboot never run. What am I doing wrong? How can I get it to reboot and still finish the task sequence?

The fact that I would be at the office 24/7 rebuilding basically everything if that were to happen.

 I’ve been given a task to find suitable governance tools for MS Teams, that can enforce some simple governance tools across a few thousand teams.
 The basics: - we want to see orphaned Teams and be able to quickly delete them
  
we want to force all current and future Teams to have at least 2 owners (so the specific departments themselves prevent orphaning their teams)
  
Does anyone know of a tool like that? We’re a very cybersecurity-minded org, with all our eggs in the MS basket, so we definitely need it securely integrate with MS.
 What solutions are you guys using? Do you think it would be better to just enforce it with PowerShell and angry emails?

When the machine boots up I am greeted by a "Program Compatibility assistant" warning saying that the driver iqvw64e.sys is vulnerable and that it cannot load.
 I looked it up and that looks like this bug: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00051.html
 So I went and installed this:
 https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15084/intel-ethernet-adapter-complete-driver-pack.html
 And when I reboot it is still telling me that the file is vulnerable.
 I noticed that when I installed the update from Intel the driver never changed at all, there are 4 copies of it on this system and they are all this file:
 05/22/2019 02:57 AM 58,304 iqvw64e.sys
 Is anyone aware if it is possible to correct this?

 I have N (e.g. 2) vrfs with associated routing tables. For simplicity, let's call it as usual, red/blue. Each of vrfs has veth interface linking into depth of Openstack, (but it's not important). red should have route to 10.0.1.0/24 via veth_red and blue should have route to 10.0.2.0/24 via veth_blue.
 I also has 10.0.3.0/24 on the dummy0 on host.
 I want to make both 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/14 to be reachable from dummy0. And I can't undestand what route and where should I put.
 I need to put route to blue vrf for 10.0.1.0/24 (and corresponding red). But how should I force host to look into those tables?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a catch-all IT manager and the latest thing to fall on my lap is joining an international office to our UK-based domain. We have a handful of staff abroad and we want to get their computers fully corporate/policy/etc.
 I don’t know where to begin as networking is my least strongest subject within my many, many hats.
 Right now those in the international office will VPN in to access network resources. But this is just like “working from home”.
 What I want is a second AD DS server over there which will act as a backup DC and allow “local” authentication, etc. Corporate laptops will therefore always be domain joined.
 Where do I begin?
 My research says something like purchasing: a router/firewall, a switch, a windows server, then the various cabling/infrastructure and probably an Aruba Instant-on AP for wireless.
 Do I configure the windows server to VPN on over to our domain? 
 I’m getting a flight over and buying a Netgate 4100 running Pfsense. Do I configure the VPN there?
 I appreciate this is a big question and a big can of worms, and I can see why people might suggest employing a 3rd party network specialist to sort it over there, but I reckon getting over the domain join hurdle and setting up the firewall are the 2 only obstacles I have.
 Any thoughts greatly appreciated – thanks from an overworked, overhatted, accidental sysadmin.

 The second 1 can take just as long to run/finish. The folder is about 1TB.

 We have a Net2 server/setup located in one office and a number of doors/ACUs connected to it locally, but we are now in the process of setting 5 doors/ACUs in a remote office – we have the network configuration in place and from the server that is hosting our Net2 server I can ping the remote office ACUs by the IP addresses they have been assigned (this only proves ICMP but I all add more on)
 The issue I note is that when I try to detect doors with the detect button I am not seeing any new doors appear in the list, however if I try to manually add one of the ACUs/Doors by MAC it lets me but when entering the IP it gives me an error/status that the IP is already in use by a device with the same MAC address
 I am not sure what exactly could be the issue here but I have noted it does get added into the Net2 Access Control tool so we can somewhat configure and use it.
 The issue is that it is not working fully as expected with the error/notice above, is there anything major we could be missing?
 To me it looks like the door is being seen by our server but not detected correctly.
 Anyone has experience with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, I changed jobs few months ago. For documentation I left following 1) Actual documentation and password for everything 2) Video training how to do specific stuff, mostly how to keep infrastructure running, intended for even non technical person to do stuff.
 Now here's the fun part, New guy comes around and starts blaming me for stuff, by stuff I mean everything Some DHCP/DNS issue arose and he started manually setting static IP for users which caused issues itself, He doesn't have any experience with Unix so logs in as root to the critical server and he accidentally deletes cron jobs He doesn't have any experience with AD and randomly messes with stuff which causes issues and other stuff I won't mention ALL of this gets blamed on me and with reason - "He didn't left enough info"
 He doesn't message me directly to ask for stuff(He only messages when he can't fix something and wants help which I am no longer providing) During office working hours whenever something breaks and he can't fix it - Old guys fault, no idea what to do.
 now normally I wouldn't care, but I have tons of non technical colleagues there and it's my reputation on line, should I get in touch with ex boss and inform him about this stuff?

 Maybe someone here can give me some new ideas...
 We have 14 devices (mostly Dell laptops, different models, and one Surface Pro) with this issue. The screen locks after 5 min regardless of power/screensaver settings.
 Some devices are running win10 others win11.
 Troubleshooting steps tried:
 - Restore power settings to default
 - Assign a different power plan
 - Modified screensaver settings or disable screensaver
 - Local Policies > Security Options > “Interactive Logon: Machine inactivity limit” set it to 900 seconds or more...
 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20\7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0 -> set attributes to 2 and then modify system unattended sleep timeout option to 30 min or whatever number above 5.
 - Checked dell optimizer proximity sensor 
 - Run power troubleshooter
 - Uninstall recent windows updates
 - All Dell updates for device are done
 Any other ideas?

I looked into creating a VPS company (https://zermous.com), however with further research I could have to pay lots of money for a colocation to support allocating external IPV4 addresses. I am able to now via routing wireguard from other VPS to the one I create, however I cannot automate this, even with programs such as ansible. I was also looking into cloud storage solutions, however there really isn't any pre-made solutions. 
 I don't have the time nor money to be constantly working on this project due to university and my job so I was hoping there was another solution to make some money off this because I don't personally need it.
 Thank you for any answers/replies.
 TLDR; 
 I have a server that I don't know what to do with.

 Question. Is it enough to have a wifi network device (router, AP, extender etc) that supports WPA3 and has the 802.11w standard (with protected management frames)? 
 Or do the cameras need something to them as well? Like do the cameras need to support 802.11w or something for this to work? My cameras doesn't have Ethernet support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 tldr: Got computers getting DHCP leases from the wrong VLAN
 Got a weird issue. At my current $job we have multiple VLANs for various systems, the basic network is CLIENT (untagged) --> Cisco Phone (Tagged) --> Meraki/Netgear Switch --> Cisco Nexus --> Router (VyOS) --> HyperFlex + Vmware --> Windows Server 2019 with DHCP (in fail over) + MDT Server.
 The VyOS router has DHCP relay listeners on all the client networks to route them to the Windows servers for DHCP (or MDT).
 Now the issue is VLAN 1 (as the default) is only used for network management, everything else is on their own VLANs.
 100 - VoIP / 200-202 - Client / 300 - Servers
 So the issue is, some PCs (Dell desktops) or laptops (Dell Laptop + Dock OR Lenovo Laptop + Dock) picks up a DHCP offer from the wrong network. Some times it could be on the old client VLAN or currently it's attempting to bind to VLAN 1's range.
 Most of the PCs, if we get Windows (10 or 11) to do a network reset (or manually do netsh winsock reset & netsh ip int reset), the system comes good.
 Notes
  
Statically setting the IP address, allows the computer to work on the correct VLAN
 The computer gets the IP but fails to release OR communicate with anything (IE if it's on the wrong VLAN)
 All the DHCP is running from 2 servers in a failover configuration under M$ on Windows
 The computers are either freshly built or been running for about 3-9 months
 Everything is updated to the latest versions (as per M$ for Windows, Dell/Lenovo for drivers, Cisco/Netgear for switches, VyOS for router)
 Each port is configured for the native VLAN to be the correct client VLAN + the VoIP VLAN being tagged for the phones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently we've been increasing security on some of our important domain accounts, mainly privileged dev & sysadmin users. Adding them to the Protected Users group was one of those measures.
 Ever since, we're not able to authenticate to our SQL Server using these accounts, neither using Windows Authentication nor SQL Server Authentication. Removing the protected users group completely removes the problem. We're aware this is due to the data not being stored in the local cache which is used in the authentication process.
 I wonder if there are workarounds, or if there's similar security features which would not break our authentication.

 Sorry if it sounds dumb or not.

 Analyzing our traffic, any type of google traffic is not reaching the Chicago region, but going to Amsterdam which is a whole other country.
 What throws me off, any google traffic from our /24 blocks goes to Amsterdam, but if use our carrier network from DC I am able to reach google in our Chicago Market... 
 I have verified everything from Geo-Location is correct to anything, still makes me pull my hair out lol.
 Verified from our carrier that they are peering with google in the same building.

 Any reason why only Google tossing our traffic to another country?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this one has been a doozy, I just wanted to see if anyone has experienced anything similar. 
 We recently had our static IP pool increased from a /30 to a /29. Ever since the change, we've had persistent bandwidth issues. Upload is pitiful, download is meh on what's supposed to be 200 symmetrical. I spent way too much time this week digging through firewall configs, running iperf tests throughout the network, checkin MTU size, cables, and generally tearing our network apart while the ISP was unresponsive. 
 I tested multiple devices of different brands isolated on the direct connection, all capable of pulling gigabit+, and all pulled 60 max. Configured the firewalls to be glorified routers, both still pulled pitiful speeds. 
 I was running a tracert during this diagnosis and saw an interesting IP in there... our old gateway for the previous static pool we had. But the firewalls and routers I tested on the connection all had the new IP and gateway set. On each, packets hit the router, hit the old gateway ip, then went on their way. All show the new public static. 
 I'm not sure if that's the cause of the bandwidth issues we're having (though I believe I've conclusively ruled out anything on our end causing it unless like 6 different routers/firewalls with no extra configs have the same issue). 
 Anyone seen an ISP route you through the wrong gateway regardless of the config on your end? Definitely a first for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep going round and round with the security guy at my work. He believes it is a perfectly acceptable solution to have an internal server accessible from the internet as long as it passes through some type of "proxy" in the DMZ. These proxies can range from an F5 virtual server that is NOT doing any WAF, to just an IIS box setup to reverse proxy. 
 In my mind I believe this is a bad idea because these proxies just do trash-in trash-out and any compromise that were to occur would now be in an internal server network instead of a DMZ.
 Is this really not as bad as I think it is, or am I right to question this practice?

 Basically, if a client gets blacklisted, the firewall stop responding at some point in the process which will often make http clients just hang eternally. I've seen CMS providers do this before where once blocked, python http requests, curl, wget will all just hang up until the process is killed or if a explicit timeout is defined.
 Is there a term given for this type of technique in networking?

 What the heck am I missing here? I've started to see this on new HP Business printers more and more. How does HP want us to handle setting up these printers in an environment with AD? I want to be able to push them out with GPOs... What gives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I am having a problem with an automation I am writing but I am having some difficulty with troubleshooting SCP on a Cisco 2960X. 
 ​
 I have two different Ansible servers. One is local to the switch, same subnet, etc. The other is a remote host in Azure, with a port forward for this specific IP to translate TCP 2222 to 22 to this test switch. The local Ansible server appears to start SCP sessions as intended. No problems, nothing in the logs to indicate any problem, multiple 40 mb files transferred. The remote one is able to open a SSH connection, but SCP sessions fail. 
 I have turned debugging on in the switch and while I do see the remote Ansible server is able to start a session, there is little to nothing in the log to indicate a problem. Same with a packet capture. It appears to start a session, start a second session, then gracefully closes both sessions. 
 The code sample I am using on both Ansible servers is identical and a direct SCP session using Ubuntu CLI does not work either. 
 The only relevant error I am seeing is from the playbook when it fails:
 ​
  
TASK [Copying image to the switch... This can take time, please wait...] ************************************************************** 
 fatal: [%hostName%]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "destination": "flash:/test.txt", "msg": "Exception received: Error transferring file to flash:/test.txt: Initializing SCP session of remote file [flash:/test.txt] for write failed with error [b'Socket error: No such file or directory']"}
  
I am frankly running out of ideas, as this makes no sense as to why its not working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I have a question regarding 802.1X. In our company we have a Development Department and guys need to run some VMs on their laptops.
 What would the behaviour be for the laptop with VMs installed?
  
Laptop will be authenticated and also VMs, since laptop (as host) is authenticated
 
Laptop will be authenticated but VMs will be not
 
Laptop will be unauthenticated also as VMs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a set of network access requirements for some systems:
  
Domains or IP addresses
 Ports
  
I would need to block connections that are not to one of those domain/IP and port combination.
 In a firewall, I am able to hardcode IP addresses that need to be allowed. For example, I can create a rule to allow traffic:
  
TCP
 IP : 123.123.123.123
 Port : 25
  
And block all other Port 25 requests, for example.
 However, the tricky thing is when domains are involved. For example, if I need to allow:
  
TCP
 Domain : Reddit.com
 Port : 443
  
I need to allow Port 443 through my firewall, but I cannot hardcore any IP addresses.
 I am now using Cisco Umbrella for DNS filtering, so that I can block DNS requests to domains that are not approved. So in the above example, I would add Reddit.com to the allow list.
 However, with port 443 now open in the firewall, and since I cannot hardcore IP addresses and rely on DNS filtering, a virus could use an IP address to exploit port 443 (no DNS request to Cisco Umbrella).
 Cisco Umbrella has an agent to guard against this, but I can’t install it because I have a Ubuntu system.
 Cisco Umbrella aside, how can you guard against viruses using hardcoded IP addresses and circumventing DNS filtering?
 I should add : I am using Ubuntu Linux as a WireGuard sever, so not a NGFW

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been tasked with taking over management of a small management company in our organization. They are completely legally separate from our main org, so they can't be on our main infrastructure. 
 They're only 10 employees, but need an RDS server as they have an old-school financial system and a couple apps which need to run on a server (and need SQL). Currently they have an older RDS server managed by an outgoing MSP. That server is attached to the MSP's domain, so the users use separate credentials for logging in to RDS.
 We're replacing/upgrading the RDS server, which on the surface is easy enough. The challenge is - this company has no domain environment otherwise, so on top of an RDS server, we'd have to spin up a DC. They do have 365 / Azure AD though.
 Just wondering - is there a more graceful way of handling RDS without the domain? Could people login using Azure auth. I'm looking for the simplist and most gaceful way of hosting a small RDS environment for 10-12 users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Or in other words: Do I need a backup MX?
 The situation is this: I want to receive newsletters from news sites. Some senders are high traffic senders that send out a lot of emails to each subscriber, sometimes even 1 per minute, or 1 per 10 minutes on average.
 I have trouble with receiving this amount with various email service providers, because I run into receiving rate limits. So, I’m considering hosting my own mail server for this purpose.
 But self-hosting on a VPS can have outages…
 I don’t mind if some emails get lost if the senders don’t retry, but I don’t want them to stop sending me all together if my server goes down temporarily.
 Let’s say my server goes down for 1 or 2 days for whatever reason. (Let’s not discuss how likely it is. There may be an outage, or I may screw something up.) Also, let’s assume my server is either up or down, but when it’s up, it’s accepting mails normally. So, I’m not rejecting mails.
 So, the question is this: If there is a busy sender that sends out a huge number of emails, and they see my server went offline or port 25 is not responding for a day or two, then what happens? What’s the most common behaviour? Will they resume sending me when my server comes online again? Or will they consider me gone forever?
 Phrasing it in another way: How long would a receiving mail server need to be down in order for a busy sender to stop sending to it all together?
 Or does it depend on the sender and the situation, and there is no standard behaviour?
 The special situation here is that these are busy senders. I understand that normally a sender should and will retry. But when a sender sends out hundreds of emails a day or more to each of its subscribers, they may handle this differently.
 Again, I don’t mind lost mails, I just don’t want to re-subscribe to the newsletters after every outage I may have.
 And I don’t really want to have a backup MX unless I really need to.
 Some expert advice would be appreciated… Thank you.

I don’t see any potential of upward mobility and my learning is decreasing over time. This has me looking for the next move. It’s no secret that DevOps and cloud are some of the hottest spaces in IT right now. Pondering transitioning into one of the other, some questions that come to mind are:
 -What are the pros and cons of each?
 -How similar are they? It seems like oftentimes I’ll see cloud and DevOps in the same sentence.
 -As a current sysadmin, what are the most important skills for me to acquire to land one of these roles?
 To expand a bit more on the last one, my current technical skillset includes general Windows enterprise management (AD, DNS, server administration w/ VMWare), intermediate scripting skill in PowerShell, automation experience with Ansible, exposure to monitoring/alerting with Prometheus & Grafana… just to name a few. So pretty general sysadmin in the modern world I would say.
 To create a plan of action, I’m looking to determine what skills to develop and how to prioritize them. Some that immediately come to mind are:
 -AWS -Terraform -Python
 What am I missing from this list, and what are your thoughts?

 I've inherited an infrastructure with an Hyper-V Cluster running in Windows server 2012 over 4 PowerEdge FC630 in a FX Cluster , there was a crash of one of the blades, and I started to get around to understand how all of this was setup (knowing the previous Admin that worked on itisn't there anymore)
 Basically right now I am facing an issue on SCVMM 2012/Hyper-V Cluter manager where I have the subnet created for LIVE Migration showing 2 subnets, the one for live migration (10.0.12.0/24) and the one for Heartbeat (10.0.11.0/24) and if I look at the Live migration settings on HyperV/SCVMM, there is indeed 10.0.11.0/24 configured as a subnet, and the delete button is greyed out, even if I add 10.0.12.0/24 and put it first, same thing if I run a powershell command, the subnet 11.0 won't disappear
 How the setup is, NIC1 and NIC2 are bonded/teamed on the windows server, there's a virtual switch created from SCVMM, with 3 interfaces on different vlan/subnet for Heartbeat/LiveMigration/HostHyperV
 Thanks for reading through and any help appreciated

I wasn't involved in setting it up so I'm trying to work out how I can fix it. When I look at our email logs, the sender email is 2 different internal domain email addresses. Our SPF record doesn't seem to include the IP address of SF's servers. Is including their IPs on our SPF record all it's going to take to fix?

 Long-time lurker, first time poster here. I hope someone here can help me get some insights on this.
 From a lot of our users, we have been getting reports that Outlook unexpectedly crashes (complete process restart).
 So far it has been impossible to reproduce, we can only analyze the logs after the fact and the only thing we know so far is that if we turn one specific add-in off, then the problem stops (it's a local add-in that helps sending e-mails with a configurable template). This add-in runs on .NET and is written in C#.
 While the support team of this add-in has been very involved with us in trying to fix this issue, there is still no way to reproduce it and management now presented us a deadline to fix it before the end of October.
 We have spent weeks gathering and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have been having issues with a switch we recently put into place in a building on our base. The setup is as follows....
 Core switch > 3850 fiber switch > 3560 access switch
 With this setup, we have been having some problems and we believe they are related to AAA. Our AAA server is ISE and it is doing TACACS as well as RADIUS and MAB for clients.
 The failures seem to be intermittent, but basically out of 4 clients, only 2 of them will authenticate. The other 2 are not failing authentication, but the MACs are also not showing up anywhere. Its like they aren't even there, even though the interface is up. The 2 devices will briefly be put into the correct VLAN, but then after a minute or so, they go back into our "black hole" vlan, and nothing about them shows up in the switch logs or ISE logs. 
 So my question is, could the issue be the fact that we are daisy chaining the 3560 and not going directly to our core switch? My boss seems to think that a setup like this is not how networking should be done. I do agree that it probably is not best practice, but I feel like the issue would be more so if the 3850 switch can handle the load of traffic going over it. Would there be any special type of configuration that needs done with a setup like this, besides just configuring a normal trunk port?
 Another thing that just popped up is we noticed that we have "switchport block unicast" on the trunk ports. We referenced another network that we managed and on that network, we only have that command on the access ports. Could that possibly be causing the inconsistent authentication errors?

 Have a bit of a strange one... This morning we've had loads of users complaining that they received multiple Teams meeting cancellation emails for various old meetings in the early hours of the morning (4:00am UK time). I've spoken to one organizer of one of these meetings. It was set up in October 2020 and he's adamant that he hasn't manually cancelled it himself. It appears its been automatically cancelled and then a notification email was sent to all users of said meeting at 4:00am.
 Is this something Outlook / Teams does automatically?
 Are there any settings available to control this behavior - particularly not to send these emails in the early hours?
 Any help, greatly appreciated.

 I’ve used netwrix and that says it is an Android 1.0 device with an incorrect password, the user says they don’t have an android device and using powershell the only mobile I can see that the user has with their email on is an iPhone which has successfully synced today. 
 Does anyone have any other solutions or things I could look at? I’m really starting to run out of ideas.

Save. 3 hours later it's back to Sale. Log in again, this time make sure it's updated in AzureAD and Exchange, query with PS. 3 hours later it's changed back again.

 For example let's say I have experience with Debian but the company I want to apply to is using Ubuntu, so when the interview comes should I'd say I know linux but not Ubuntu specifically. Would this lower my chances of being hired by alot?
 When I know something in theory but don't remeber the commands should i say I know how to do it and then watch online for the commands?

 We have a hybrid environment (Win2016/Exchange 2016), that I am gradually migrating to Office 365.
 Migrating users is going fluently.
 However we also have some distribution groups, used for 'generic' email addresses. 
 The issue is that these distribution groups are not synced to Office 365 (by AD Connect). So as they are not visible in Office365, I can't migrate them to Office 365. 
 For Ad Connect, I have made a security group "AD Sync Office 365", that I have added all users to. And in AD Connect wizard, I am have selected this security group in the filtering page. So AD connect is only syncing object in this security group.
 So I am suspecting that our distribution groups are not syncing because these distribution groups are not a member of the mentioned security group. And I can't find a way to add he distribution groups to this security group.
 In AD connect troubleshooting these distribution groups , I also get this error :
 Object is not present in sync scope as group filtering is enabled and the object is not a member of filtering group "CN=AD_Sync_Office365,OU=Security Groups,OU=MyBusiness,DC=xxxxx,DC=local".
 Do you have some advice?

 . We maintain a sd wan network with remote sites all over the world and one of them was complaining about a server not being reachable intermittently, this server is accessed by this site only so we only got this complaint from them, interestingly, we are able to ping this server once or twice successfully from Site A core switch, but the rest of the attempts fail to reach for some time, then works again and so forth, meanwhile site B is able to reach it the same time A couldn't, the same thing happens when trying from B when B couldn't reach while A could, this is not a packet loss issue btw, when it pings, it pings perfectly without latency or loss even 10k reps, but when it fails, it fails completely. I understand the issue has to be with the server, but can't figure out what, probably multiple session related, I would like to know if you guys have experienced any such issues, Im not deeply experienced myself but haven't come across this issue.

 So I assume this is just getting an intune device license and setting it up as a shared device as per this guide??
 I've not done this before as all users are normally assigned to devices with M365 Bus prem or E3. Is this the correct way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have an RDS deployment running a single RemoteApp group and 4 load balanced Session Hosts.
 Due to issues with roaming profiles, we want to restrict this RemoteApp group to a single session per user as much as possible.
 I'm at the point where I've managed to change the sessions limit so individual session host VM will only accept 1 active/disconnected session per user, which is great cause it means we can't have Mike logging into RDS #4 twice at the same time from 2 clients.
 ​
 However because the Session Hosts are load balanced using a broker, I can't control on which server someone is going to get a session. Which means that even though Mike is logged into RDS #4, there's a possibility he'll also get a new session on RDS #2 if he logs on from a different PC.
 Preferably in this case want session RDS #4 to get disconnected and reactivated on his new client.
 ​
 Does anyone know whether this is possible?

 Let's say i start the policy with fundamental template and set it to transparent and enforcement period is 7 days, now after 7 days will the policy move to blocking automatically? Or can i control the timing, because i wouldn't want the policy to move into blocking at night or something, so how can i control the timing?
 Also, note the fundamental policy template starts in blocking mode right away..
 And even with 7 days of enforcement period, the automatic policy builder will restart the policy building process everytime it detects new traffic right? How does this work exactly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to run my Rust API web server on Hetzner's cheapest cloud offering called CX11 for 4.55 €/month. Specs are:
 CX11
 vCPU 1 Intel
 RAM 2 GB
 Disk space 20 GB
 Traffic 20 TB
 The backend Rust app (using Actix) is a non-issue - it's under 20MB and no RAM spikes at all even under benchmarking via wrk etc.
 The proxy server will by Nginx which is also a non-issue when it comes to RAM consumption.
 I want to use Ubuntu 22.04 but if it eat too much RAM perhaps I could try Alpine - I want to run things like wkhtmltopdf (this will spike the RAM for a few seconds unfortunatelly) etc. but perhaps that is a non-issue.
 I don't want to use Docker - the 2 GB RAM would be an issue and with one file deployment of the Rust binary app it's not worth it.
 The most important question I have is about the SQL db I will use.
 So, it has to be relational database and I have only a couple of options: MySQL, PostgreSQL and perhaps some forks like MariaDB or something else.
 Can you recommend a DB that is the most RAM efficient under heavy load? I am mostly interested in reads, not so much writes into the DB. As I said it is an API backend that mostly serves JSON via relatively simple selects and an occassional joint here and there - nothing too crazy though.
 I will probably off-load the homepage for not-logged in users and some mostly accessed parts of the app to Redis, but still, I want something that would work relatively well when it comes to the available 2 GB RAM even without Redis - at least from the beginning ;)
 It will be mostly mobile apps accessing the API, so frontend rendering etc. is not the problem here.
 Thanks for your recommendation and advice - especially if you have used Hetzner CX11 servers or some other servers like this with databases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 Recently I have got into I.T, in our warehouse prob( 300-400 people overall) as someone with no IT background. We are working as system administrators even though we do not access to a lot of stuff, we have a HQ group called Central , they have to give permissions for certain stuff( I assue they are level 2 or level 3 ). So recently for preaparation for Black Friday our packing department have been prepared and did some mock test with like 50 packers at the same time. 
 The problem is that as soon as people (30-50 start to work the invoice from our printer gets really slow to print sometimes (1- 2 minutes, normally it takes like 5-10 second).
 We use DLX as a WMS. We have given a list to Central with all the cabinets and sockets that these printers are using so they can monitor it. They said they have not seen any slowness from that part. ok.
 In DLX we have a thing called "Run Task". It basically shows when the sytem processed the order. So if you check the time from the moment you press the print button after you packed an order until the run task actually run you can see the time it took to process it. its quick like couple seconds. ok. 
 And then we have a print server where we have all the printers added ( something like a print host). This is the last idea we have currently to check how long does it take from the DLX to send the information to this print server. Everything we have checked or sent to Central came back as no issues or signs for slowness.
 Also its confusing because during people's breaktime there were like 25 packers only, printing went back to like 5 second. And then after an hour with like 30 or 35 ish people it just slowed down to 1 minute again. ( it is kind of inconsistent.)
 ​
 Does anybody have any other idea what would worth to be checked?

I’ve gone from job to job working various sys admin and cloud roles and they are all the same, public and private sector. Between the overnight maintenance windows, the early morning releases, the horrible on call, the boss who expects you in at your regular time despite being up at 2-4am for maintenance while on call, the sleep deprivation, constant projects and dealing with non technical people with big dreams but no idea how to achieve them so they look to you. I am so done with it all and feel like a failure to my family when I have to leave a job due to absolutely becoming a zombie of a person. 
 I remember being way happier when I worked at McDonald’s as a youth. At least I could go home and do whatever for the rest of the night and not have to worry about work. 
 My most care free time in IT was working as a 3rd tier Support Analyst, just working tickets out of Service Now all day and being on call once every 3 months where you could go years without getting called. I either need to try and do something like that again or change industries completely because IT Infrastructure is not it for me.

(showed a friend a 2Petabyte Ceph Cluster that I helped create for a company (permission given from the company, of course)) That and I just love tinkering with stuff, its like playing with Legos, there's always something to create, rebuild, make better, etc. There's many reasons why I like IT but those are just the some of the reasons.

 Now they want people coming back to the office. And people are just quitting, especially managers. And when we interview people, we tell them that we want them in 2 days a week. We make them an offer, and they don't even return our calls to accept it.
 My manager is still there, but her boss is gone. All of my manager's peers have left in the last 2 months.
 Everyone says that they're more than willing to come into the office, but only if there is a reason to. There's no point in dragging yourself into the office if you're just going to be on Teams calls and remotely connecting to stuff. You can do all that at home and save yourself the commute.
 There's a rumor they're going to start reviewing badge access logs to make sure people are coming in.
 I'm curious how this is going to end. We're bleeding IT staff every month.

 From my understanding it's Employees; public key....but why would you encrypt a message with a " public " key ? The whole point or a " secret " is to keep it " private ".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question about how the DUAL algorithm works, perhaps it is obvious but overlooked in the literature. What happens when a link drop/trace disconnect occurs when there are several successors but no FS (all the routes have the same metric)? Is the algorithm not activated and just the next successors take the place of the predecessor, or is the algorithm being ran and the successors are recalculated?
 Edit: Maybe I have not specified enough, I mean such a specific case as in the screenshot. It is a route from R2 to R7, R2 has 3 tracks, all are successors (each link has the same cost) and no FS. If the link between R2 and R3 fails, will one of the two other successors be added to the routing table immediately, or will the algorithm restart and recalculate the routes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I support a nonprofit that has an office on the ground floor of a three-story mixed commercial office building. We have a small network with a file server, Unifi edgerouter and UAP 2.4/5 access point. Because of the nature of the nonprofit's work, specialists need to bring their work laptops in and out and switch rooms frequently, and so hardwiring really isn't an option. Recently, users have been getting disconnected from the wifi intermittently in the afternoons between about 2 and 4. I added a second AP to a corner of the office where a lot of interruptions were reported, but it hasn't seemed to help. I've tried different channels, as it is a crowded environment, but no luck, and the APs automatically choose channels in normal operation anyway). I've confirmed that it isn't an issue with the network itself; hardwired devices work fine, and network activity appears normal. The issue is disconnection from the access points. I've spoken to several of our neighbors; a next-door neighbor reports the same thing, the one on the other side doesn't. 
 I'm wondering if there's some kind of RF interference that's causing this, but I'm at a loss as to how to track it down. The issue of whether it's a 2.4ghz vs 5ghz issue is a bit murky to me, since (as is common) the two bands share the same SSID, so it's difficult to know which one a device is connecting to. The building is kind of a beast, so the 5ghz AP doesn't penetrate walls well. In any case, I don't want to confuse users by splitting them up, though.
 How would y'all proceed from here?

Summary
Actions to Help Protect Against Russian State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Activity:
From November 2021 through January 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responded to advanced persistent threat (APT) activity on a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization’s enterprise network. During incident response activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple APT groups compromised the organization’s network, and some APT actors had long-term access to the environment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit called Impacket to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.

 Looking to get some help with this device but before I start I just wanted to mention I have some basic networking knowledge and was just given this to figure out and configure. 
 Problem: After setting up the AP with an IP and Name. I assigned a DHCP pool(with gateway & DNS). Everything works fine until I power it off and back on to see if it will come back up and the SSID doesn't broadcast. 
 How I configured: 1. connected to POE+ switch, AP powered on
 2. connected to the AP via putty to view the status
 3. connected to the AP's default SSD
 3. opened https://mywifi.cisco.com/webui/ and logged w/ webui/cisco credentials
 4. Followed the initial config steps with admin account, SSID name and IP for the AP
 5. reconnected to the AP via the new SSID
 6. configured an IP to my laptop of the same subnet and opened the webui via the IP I assigned, logged in with admin I created
 7. created a DHCP pool(assigned gateway and DNS)
 8. removed the static IP and reconnected to see if the DHCP works 
 After those steps it looked to be working fine, until I rebooted it and the SSID is no where to be found.
 Appreciate any help & suggestions

 I have been tasked with finding laptops for new hires and the CEO would like a "range of options" from $100 - $400. Usually, finding laptops is easy. However, looking for laptops in this cheaper, budget range has been difficult. Every list, forum post, recommendation, etc. for employee laptops are all over $400.
 Is anyone here knowledgeable about reliable, lower end budget laptops? I am going to convince the CEO that anything near $100 is not going to work (unless I am wrong here) and we will want something solid closer to the $300 - 400 range.
 Any insights? Thank you in advance. 
 WOW! Thank you for all of the responses everyone - I gained some great insights here.

 In like half of deployments I've seen that the default passwords on printers were not changed.
 I get it, I was guilty of this as a sysadmin as well. "It's just a printer, what damage can it do".
 Well, once I started pentesting, I realized that if a service is setup with credentials in the printer (LDAP, SMTP, SMB, etc) I could point it back at my machine, and capture the credentials.
 Sometimes it's just gives me access to a regular domain account.
 But in several engagements I've used this to priv esc and become domain admin.
 A few examples of how I became domain admin:-The accounts had DCsync privileges, so I could sync all the domain account NTLM hashes and privesc that way-Password reuse and printer service account shared the same password with a domain admin-One service account had domain admin rights
 This isn't a new attack. After I discovered this attack path, I stumbled across a presentation from Defcon 19 (which was 11 years ago) talking about these sort of attacks.
 The remediation is simple though, just change your MFPs' default passwords.

The errors are vague but it only seems to be affecting Exchange users, not 365 (we're hybrid currently).
 Would love to know if this is affecting anyone else, and figured we can use this thread to voice any other issues with this workaround.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering how old domains and previous admins making various changes to domains at the admin level such as sweeping permission changes misconfigurations that are carried forward to each successive migration NT4, 2000, .. 2019 etc. Does Microsoft do any checks and bounds to verify any excessive permissions. Do some thing get corrected automagically during an upgrade?
 I am mainly talking about historic misconfigurations. Is there any way to really clean this stuff up. Think of the current domain you are running.. who was running it when it was NT4, receptionist?, Some random office guy? What did they do to it? Inexperienced Admins?
 I know I made errors that I had to clean up later. I also had to clean up things I noticed wrong. I am sure I left some dirty socks somewhere as well. 
 Where do these problems come back and bite us in the ass? Is this part of the growth process of a large secure mature network that has someone go through a total clean up of the domain threw some involved process in the manner a domain must be cleaned after a breach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. We are a small company looking to replace our SonicWall. 
 We have three sites : one main site with TZ600 in HA cluster (40 users/computers - 2 esx) and two other sites with TZ300 (5 users/computers - 1 small server and 20 users/computers - 1 small server).
 Our biggest site has a main internet fiber (200 Mbs) with backup link, some VOIP phones with dedicated fiber (20 Mbs). The other two sites only have one internet link each (about 50 Mbs per site).
 The current needs we have/features we use : traffic/content/geo filtering, load balancing for wan interfaces, site to site VPN (with the physical sites and Azure), user VPN, DPI, IDS/IPS.
 In the future I know for sure our CEO will ask us for internet usage reports and such things.
 Management would also love to reduce the cost of the annual licence (budget is max 2000$ for all three sites per year) and even better, go with pfSense and only pay support. Even though we are a small company, I am not convinced with pfSense as I have only seen them in homelabs situation.
 Also Fortinet would be the cherry on top but it is probably too expensive for us ?
 As I am mostly a sys/cloud admin, I am looking for your kind help if you have any recommendations and hope I provided enough details.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I just need an idea or a few and some criticism from someone with experience in PS scripting, if any of you has the patience. I have just a bit of experience with scripting, but mainly simple commands (I don't dare calling them scripts) like get-something|foreach{ do some stuff}. And I composed this first big script that I intend to use in automated AzAD user provisioning. 
 The script will take the employee data (Firstname, lastname, workmail, etc) from the HR System (BambooHR) with an API call and it then creates users/modify them in AzAD using a foreach loop, some identifiers from BambooHR attributes+AzAD attributes and IFs to identify the operations needed to be performed. I also wanted to have logging as good as possible, there are still some things to be improved on this part too. It's not yet completed, this is the first working and tested version, (I did run it in production, yes :) but before I did, I exported every single user attribute/licenses info to a csv and prepared a script to restore everything back to the state using this csv) I will also adjust the documentation based on the final result. I'm also thinking of a better...logical way to go for 3 big IF-s. But I was thinking, what else can I use instead of those many many If-s? I thought of array comparison, but there would still be IF-s....some custom function? Please let me know some suggestions, and how good I'm doing.
 Overall, the script performance looks "ok" from my perspective (the company has less than 150 employees right now) and, when it had to modify about 10 users and create 2 accounts, it took 2 minutes to run. And when it just checked stuff, with applying only 2 modifications, it took 34 seconds.
 Here you can find it
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have an issue we are trying to troubleshoot. Our setup is this....
 Core > 3850 fiber switch > 3560 switch
 All switches are using ISE for tacacs.
 The issue is with the 3rd switch that is not connected directly to the core. It will sometimes let us log in with the usernames we have saved on ISE, and then sometimes those wont work and we will have to use the local account that is setup on the switch as an account of last resort. 
 When we have the login issues, all the switch logs tell us is that authentication has failed with that username. We don't see any logs about losing connection to ISE or anything like that. Just the username authentication failures. 
 When we look at ISE, we do not see the authentication failures, all we see are the successful authentications. So that tells me that when we are having the authentication issues, we some how are losing connection to ISE because these failures are not shown. 
 We are also using ISE for RADIUS and doing client authentication with MAB. Clients are also losing their authentication intermittently. Same thing though, this failure is not shown on ISE.
 This issue only occurs with the switch that is "daisy chained" and not directly connected to the core. And again, nothing in the logs indicating a loss with the ISE server.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be the issue? We are on a webex with TAC at the moment, but seem to not be getting anywhere. My assumption is that the daisy chained switch is some how losing connection to ISE, but again not seeing any logs indicating this. Connection to the switch is not an issue, because like I said , when this issue occurs, I can still reach the switch and login with the local account.

We have one customer where we provided internet for them, when we tested it from the laptop, it worked fine. But when plugging it into the router, it does not work. We tried 6 different routers, from home ones to business ones. We tried to check for any policies with the IT team and everything is alright. We've used the same switch for diff. companies and it worked fine. In fact, we have the same exact setup at a diff. location and it works just fine. The connection is through a microwave link. We've tried to add multiple public IPs, and extend but nothing worked. We contacted our main provider and they said the issue is not from their side (their customer service is non existent) we have 48 hours before the customer cancels their service. the only solution i can think of is to use the server as a router but obv there's a deeper issue. Any help would be HIGHLY appreciated

Thus far I am able to ping from the 9K to the OCI side just fine however BGP is stuck in IDLE.. From what I see from parsing through the BGP debugs it looks like a " maximum number of prefixes reached", however, I am unsure of how since I have not set any limiters on this and I am also not sure if this is what is preventing BGP peering to form..

 I obviously started with looking up on Google and there's lots of services that look like they would fit the bill, but before I start submitting my email and number to companies for quotes I Thought it would be best off to get the communities advice.
 We are currently a company of 64 users but quickly growing and Ideally looking for the following as minimum:
  
Spam Blocking
 Phishing blocking
 Email Spoofing
 A services that allows for easy scalability as we grow with numbers.
  
If anyone can recommend a product and price per user then I'd be eternally grateful.

 I have installed updates via wsus before but there is currently a filter created for the updates so all I do every month is approve the updates for the applicable servers. If I am dealing with a new server, presumably I need a lot of updates. So do you put this new vm in its own group, then go into the wsus and approve all the updates I need for this 1 group? (that way only this pc gets all these updates) how do I know which updates will need to be installed? I figured I would then remove the pc from this group and put it into the permanent group I use for Server 2019 computers.
 I am asking you guys so that I at least have the right idea. I can figure out how to implement it.
 I need clarification because on my own personal computer, when it's brand new, it usually gets a bunch of updates. I imagine this is the same way that things work for a brand new windows server. Perhaps this is not the case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We're currently in the process of moving to 2022 server. The new servers have been promoted as DCs and are replicating with no issues. 
 When running repadmin /showrepl and repadmin /replsummary there are no issues. But when running DCDiag we see:
 Starting test: DFSREvent
 There are warning or error events within the last 24 hours after the
 SYSVOL has been shared. Failing SYSVOL replication problems may cause
 Group Policy problems.
 ......................... DC1 failed test DFSREvent
 ​
 We're wanting to move the FSMO roles across. However not sure where to proceed with the following errors. 
 We get a warning first:
 The DFS Replication service is stopping communication with partner DC2 for replication group Domain System Volume due to an error. The service will retry the connection periodically. 
 Additional Information: 
 Error: 9036 (Paused for backup or restore) 
 Connection ID: 
 Replication Group ID: 
 Followed by an informational: (This happens about 20 seconds later)
 The DFS Replication service successfully established an inbound connection with partner DC2 for replication group Domain System Volume. 
 Additional Information: 
 Connection Address Used: DC2
 Connection ID: 
 Replication Group ID: 
 ​
 My main concern is if we move the FSMO with these current warnings and something fails we're stuck.
 A google hasn't really brought up much advices.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're looking at using Windows Event Forwarding. I can find documentation on how to set it up either so clients push or the receiving server pulls, but very little on why I would favour one option over the other.
 I could describe our intended setup, but I'm really trying to understand why I'd pick push or pull so that I'll know the answer in any setup.
 Searching this sub hasn't thrown up anything too obvious so please, if you have any advice, I'll all ears. (Which makes it hard to type.)

I didn't get told at our branch this was coming..so much for change management
 Our internet has been functionally broken now for the 2 days they did it. (hsts, encryption errors all suggesting that deep ssl has broken stuff)
  
This becomes very frustrating. Our division may be sold (which I'm now more welcoming) but corp to down applies a feature, breaks our internet and I'm left holding the end user bag. I can't literally change anything just factually reply (and very carefully) about what's broken. The fact that I found about this change AFTER they did it surprises me not at all.

 Once I set the MAR attributes for the phone it works fine, but I'm trying to understand why the port just doesn't shut immediately with a phone (or any IoT device that doesn't understand 802.1x for that matter).
 I'm not trying to fix this, I'm just trying to understand why. There doesn't seem to be a lot (any) of literature that discusses this.

 Would be good to know how people are blocking Windows 11 who are managing many devices.
 We use N-Able RMM Patching which has not been successful in blocking Windows 11 and when we called support they simply provided a script to set the target release.
 Many of our clients are Intune but we've chosen to use N-Able for patching primarily to cover third party patching but we're unsure if we enable the Feature Update Ring in Intune whether that would work in stopping Windows 11. I think we found if N-Able is on the device it takes over all elements of the patching aspect and ignores Intune.
 In any case we are meandering options but would be good to know what you do.
 Another question - if you set the target release on a device does that prompt it to update immediately or does that just say to the device you can only go up to this release as and when its made available?
 ​
 Many thanks.

 I have a client that uses a few hosted internal HTTP sites. These sites are also forwarded on from the router so external access is possible. They have now requested for the sites to be secure, and use HTTPS (when accessing externally via the forwarded port) as that complies with their external IT team's policies. I am aware you need an SSL certificate to do this, and probably need one with a SAN of the external IP address.
 Where do you install this though? On the router? On each of the HTTP web servers?
 All help would be appreciated!

I'm a bit worried that I've come across a bit foolish, as if I'd known who they they were, I'd have been better prepped.
 Am I right to be worried, or was this person just an extreme case? I've had 1 other interview at this stage and it wasn't as bad, more like what technologies I know etc.
 Also, is this amount of interviews at this stage normal (based in EMEA)

I did this a couple a days ago, and ever since that I am unable to use this account to do administrative tasks on my computer.
 My admin account work on other computers, and other accounts work on my computer (as long as I remember to activate my PIM role before I try to do an administrative task). 
 My computer is an Azure AD only device managed with Intune. I have tried several reboots and made sure to activate my PIM role before i try to use the account. Normally I use "run as" on my administrative task, but the same issue occurs even when I log in to the computer with the admin account. After doing some testing the same issue appears when logging in other computers without enabling the PIM role.
 Based on this I believe that my admin account is somhow cached on my device, and it believes that it is not an admin. Is there a way to make my computer know that my admin user has admin rights (hopefully remote and without admin access)?

Whenever this desktop is plugged in, it has always received the same IP address even after removing reservation. Could be lease time I guess. The only switches I found onsite are Cisco SGs that dont seem to have any port security or port channel configs. Another weird thing is when the desktop was plugged into the problem port, the firewall's arp table shows the device's MAC address. 
 The DHCP address its receiving is fine and from correct server. I tried a static and same issue. Also the desktop works fine elsewhere. Its just this desktop with this port. Very confused.

 I wanted to see if anyone has run into a similar situation. 
 I have a setup where I am using a core transport router for aggregation into an edge router. Both are handed off using an ASR 9k. 
 We recently swapped the ASR 9k (running IOS XR) for the transport out from an ASR 900 (running IOS XE). 
 Out of around 50 mpls LDP l2vpn's, 7 or so would not come up on the new router, so we had to hand them off on a different router that is in the same DC. The router that works with the remote peers is an IOS XE device. 
 Everything that we can see is matching (MTU, tag manipulation, etc.) 
 The xconnect/psuedowires are coming up/establishing, but are not performing two-way traffic on the connection. We can see this in some cases first-hand since we own the connections ourselves on both sides of the interfaces. 
 I have also started a TAC case to see if we have encountered some bug in the code, etc. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was able to pass the initial round of AWS's screening, and I've already provided them my preferred time for the phone interview (not yet confirmed). Therefore, I wondered if anyone here had recent job interview with them and would mind sharing some advice on how to ace it or at the very least your strategy for passing the technical interview. Some folks in Glasdoor says that the q&a is quite difficult.
 It appears that some of the Q&A require a deep understanding of the TCP even the required years of experience are equal to associate level. lol I definitely need to prepare for and refresh on that.... already forgot some foundations and basics. :) Do I need to write any code for the automation part, or can I just explain the method and procedure (ex func, modules etc).
 Ive been watching a lot of youtube vids, and I'm wondering if I should just use the Star approach or if I also need to have the 16 Leader Principles in my pocket for the phone interviewer or for the Loop interview.
 They say that, before the pandemic they sponsored the applicant's flight and accommodation to Sydney for a face-to-face interview.. 5-6hrs interview haha... but has been replaced by this loop interview which is virtual :(.
 Anyways, whatever happens, it seems like this will be a positive experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a trunk link and noticed the aqua om3 cable being used and the SFP+ were LR and traffic was getting through. However, there some instances that packets were failing. 
 I swapped the LR with an 10G-SR and the links showed as notconnected. The transceiver showed the rx was -3db. I changed the SFP to 1G SX and this one worked and I was able to pass traffic.
 Why the 10G-SR was showing down/down despite the rx was -3db? The duplex was full and the speed was 10Gbps. I can see the red light at the end of the cable.
 The working one is 1G SX and the switch interface being used was the "ten1/1/x" instead of g1/1/x. 
 What does it mean if the SFP+ SR not showing any light from its tx port? Does the LR modules show light on its tx port?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/networking
 We're rolling out remote access to 100+ remote workers at a health care organization (mid-size and fast growing). Their different offices are geographically separated and each office has an-prem SQL based application isolated behind a firewall. They are using Fortinet for their firewall stack. Using VPN based approach gave pretty poor results in terms of launching the application. It took about 10-15 minutes just to load the application over VPN. Whereas in normal cases it takes about 10-15 seconds to fully load the application.
 I came across some other technologies like ZTNA, SDP, and SASE but I'm not very familiar with these solutions, however we're open to any ideas. 
 Any suggestions on how to improve performance and eliminate as much latencies as possible would be greatly appreciated.

 The issue I have is that I've only been with this company for a year, and everyone that knew anything about them is long gone. There is no documentation on each VM anywhere. 
 So obviously the simplest answer is shut it down and when some one complains then I'll know, but I would like not to do that. 
 I have to shut down the server for the migration, but I would like to know what services I'm bring down. Obviously there's simple ones like AD, DNS and DHCP, but others are leaving me puzzled. Some have a webserver service installed, but there's no real files with any information saved in the server. I used the comman netstat to see traffic and there really isn't anything and if there is its not enough information to go off of. 
 So what advice do you guys have when it comes to figuring out what the purpose of a server is?

I've pulled out all my hair and I'm about to start on my eyebrows. All of the index settings are correct, folder settings are correct, but Windows still search T: instead of T:.

There is already a pre-existing topology and I was given just excel sheets for the various IP addresses, point-to-point connections, and usernames and passwords for the whole setup (although it's useful, it's still not the most put together but I am grateful).
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a potential, better way to keep track of everything, and maybe I even get to see the whole topology, virtually, so I can have a better idea of how everything is interconnected? I was thinking of something like one of the two major network simulation tools. How have you kept track of your environment?

 Just wanted to let everyone know that if you're using PDQ without LAPS, that's a method I'll usually use to privesc from local admin to domain admin.
 I've only been pen testing for a couple of months and I've already used PDQ to privesc in a few clients environments already. Basically every place I've seen PDQ. Sure, PDQ added LAPS functionality somewhat recently, but I haven't seen a client that has used LAPS with PDQ. Usually they'll create a service account with domain admin rights and that's what they'll use for PDQ.
 I tried bringing this up a couple of months ago in /r/pdq, but they did not want to hear it. I loved using PDQ as a sysadmin, but I think its users need to know this.
 Edit: typo
 Also, here’s the link from PDQ on how to setup PDQ with LAPS.

 We have a very old ethernet switch: 3COM Baseline Switch 2924-SFP Plus (it was installed in the year 2009) and one of the ports has this SFP transceiver:
 Sfp transceiver
 My boss asked me to replace this switch and to accomplish this task, I need to know the type of transceiver.
 I plan to turn off the switch, disconnect the fiber optic patch cord and extract the transceiver to take photos of the patch cord and the transceiver.
 I have never in my life handled fiber optics sfps and patch cords and I don't have any spares to replace them in case of problems.
 Now my questions:
 ¿Is this the proper, safe way to handle the sfp and fiber optics patch cord, without harming them?
 ¿If if fine to assume that when I insert the transceiver, connect the patch cord and turn on the switch everything is going to work again?
 Thanks in advance for your kind help.
 ​
 EDIT1: My boss told me that this fiber optic link was installed 20 to 22 years ago and this was not the first switch where it was connected.
 EDIT2: This a better photo of the fiber optic:
 Fiber optic better photo
 EDIT3: Accoding to web page of the switch, the link is 1000M of speed:

 So we were tasked to create a network for our assigned business. We got assigned a sales company, 50 users. In our original design, we have a PA-820 doing the internal routing along with it's firewall duties. One of my classmates was giving me shit about how it wouldn't be able to handle internal traffic for 50 users and handle the SSL/TLS Decryption and other features. I'm not sure if he's blowing smoke up my ass or what... I would like to try and prove him wrong but I don't really have any metrics as to what kind of internal traffic we would be handling - as it's all theoretical. 
 Which leads me to my question. Is it common practice for small / medium sized businesses to buy separate equipment for their router and firewall? Is it really not reasonable to have a FW of that caliber do the internal routing? At my workplace we have multiple branch offices with 20-80 people and our older MX64's handle it just fine.

 Customer needs a site to site VPN set up. Policy based ikev2.
 Internal networks are say 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.100.0/24
 Remote site consists of 2 IPs - say 192.168.10.10 and 192.168.10.20.
 The problem is that the remote site will only accept traffic coming from 172.16.0.0/28 .
 I'd like any suggestions on how to accomplish this inside the ASA. I'm at a loss of how to re-address traffic from 10.0.1.0 / 10.0.100.0 to 172.16.0.0 before it heads to the outside interface.
 Additionally due to the size discrepancies of the 10 vs 172 networks - it seems like it would somehow need to involve a nat dynamic interface type setup...

 And we see that everyday.
 People have been doing this at scale in the modern western workforce for decades, such as those with retirement on the horizon or people who only come to work to shop online and forward email. Add into that mix all the office politics and nepotism, and it's ubiquitous.
 If you suffer an injury, are recovering from surgery, a personal situation occurs (death of a loved one, divorce, new baby, etc.), anything along those lines, obviously that may demand more time away from work and/or less ability to perform the work when doing it. I understand quiet quitting to be checking out just because.
 I'm open to discussion here. If there's no clear definition, then we are arguing points on entirely different concepts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been chasing down this strange issue where devices randomly become inaccessible. So far I've had about a dozen different devices (NAS, Printers, Moxas) in different vlans in the past week. We notice suddenly we are not able to ping a device. If you get on the same vlan, you can ping it. When I check the network switch, it does not show a mac address associated with that device. Unplugging and plugging back in doesn't work neither does changing to another static IP (same vlan). If you change the vlan and slap on a different IP, it'll ping; then if you change it back to the original vlan, it'll still ping. 
 The one thing in common with all of these issues is that the mac address does not appear on the switch it's connected to (different switches/models/locations). The switches all connect to a router, which also does not show the mac address. So I'm assuming since that information isn't anywhere, when I ping a device, the router doesn't know where to send it. Anyone ever deal with this?

 I know there are lots of post about different firewalls and heck I have used most of them myself.
 I am in a rare position where I am building out some new infrastructure and the C suite truly just wants to provide me the budget to purchase the best of what I need. 
 I am leaning towards Palo as its just a rock solid product and in my experience it has been great. Their lead times are a little out of control so I do need to look at other options if that doesn't pan out. 
 My VAR is pushing a juniper solution but I have never used juniper and I'm not really sure I want to go down that rabbit hole. 
 All that being said if you had a blank check which product would you go with an why? 
 ​
 I should mention we are a pretty small shop. We will be running an MPLS some basic routing (This isn't configured yet so I'm not tied to any specific protocol as of now), VPN's and just a handful of networks. We do have client facing web servers and some other services but nothing so complex that it would rule any one enterprise product out.

 The cost is very similar so that shouldn't be a factor.

 I have 5 AP's on campus. For safety reasons, they do not have cat 6 because switches cannot be fielded, so I have one root AP and 4 client AP's that bridge wirelessly back to the root AP with line of sight. Now I need to add more AP's but they are too far from the root bridge and no line of sight. However, they do have line of sight to and are close enough to some of the client/non-root AP's. Is there a way I can set up an AP in wireless repeater mode that peers to the non-root bridge while the non-root bridge maintains it's wireless bridge connection to the root bridge?
 i.e. Repeater AP-------------Non-Root Bridge AP-----------------Root Bridge AP--------------------Core.
 The only cable involved here is the on on the root bridge back to the core. Everything else would be wireless peering.

 I know how to restrict users to NOT be able to log into RDS, but what if I want them ONLY to be able to log into the RDS server?
 You can't use the "Log On To..." option within AD as it appears that with RDS it also requires the user login access on in connecting PC too - but these users are remote (WFH). 
 So how do I go about allowing remote users ONLY access to the RDS server?
 Thanks, and I'm going to go get some more coffee.

 Other switches have taken the update without question, but I can't find anything specific about this one that would explain it.
 A previous update attempt failed with "./fw-install.sh: line 57: can't create /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update/update.log: nonexistent directory" but I fixed that with 'mkdir /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update' followed by 'touch /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update/update.log' -- however I suspect that this indicates some wrongness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I attempted to clean install Windows 11 22H2 on my work laptop as a weekend project. Everything seemed to be working well, until I tried to add my user as a local admin. I kept getting a username or password is incorrect for my domain admin creds. I was able to RDP into a domain controller to verify I wasn't locked out. Tried hitting multiple file shares, no dice. I was prompted for user creds. My older Surface was recently upgraded, so I verified the same failures on that as well. 
 All told, three 22H2 laptops seem to have a major issue with domain authentications. The Surface was upgraded, so I was able to roll back to 21H2, and all of the issues were resolved. 
 Has anyone encountered this yet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days back, I came across a setting to restrict user access to the administration portal. After checking, I realize how easily we let users access the organization's information without any privileges. To make you all aware of this setting, I came up with a blog that includes the steps to restrict users' access to Azure AD data and PowerShell modules. But, I got a negative impact from a few Redditors saying that it is invalid and nothing can be changed with this setting as it is a directory.
 Though it is a directory, do non-admins really need to access the organization's information? Even one single vulnerability can easily break the security chain nowadays. Isn't it? But, the comments made me conclude that restricting user access is not as significant as other security measures. 
 But today, I came across an update from MS on the recent two zero-day vulnerability issues and the required mitigation steps. Their strong recommendation is to disable the non-admin access to the remote PowerShell module. Now, I have a question, Isn't it necessary to restrict non-admins?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Hope I'm in the correct subreddit. I just had an idea yesterday, hoping to confirm it here.
 My home only has copper cables (no fiber possible) which prevents me to subscribe to any internetplan above 100Mbit/s.
 I've been thinking of buying a 5G-Router which in my country/location achieves roughly 2Gbit/s down (I know that latency is different over 5G than Fiber but this is something I'm willing to accept). 
 The issue is, that 99% of routers I've seen don't have a SFP port but only 1Gbit LAN-Ports and the ones that do have an SFP-Port cost more than 1600€.
 Now, my idea is to buy a 5G-Router like this one from MikroTik https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g . I have a SuperMicro CSE-118 lying around with an Intel 340-T4 (Quad Port RJ45) and an Intel X520-DA2 (SFP+) in it which I would use as an pfSense Server.
 Would it be possible to connect 4 Ports of the 5G Router to the Server, link aggregate them, connect the SFP-Port to a switch, and distribute the whole possible bandwith of 2Gbit to other devices?
 This is just a rough idea and I haven't thought about possible hickups (or none came to my mind thinking about this)
 Thank you all in advance!

 Now I need to find a setup that can work like that. Do you guys have any good suggestions to solve this?
 I was thinking maybe a Surface Go tablet with a pen that is domain joined then cast it to the display... Or a secondary touch display that people can connect to their laptop, and that is mirrored to the big screen...
 Please refrain from recommending anything from Apple, the Apple hate-boy culture is immens in the company.

 For a trading application, I need to do an HTTP request to a certain endpoint, which in turn resolves to a CloudFlare IP. This CloudFlare IP is "hosted" in the NWAX Internet Exchange Point in Portland, and I would like to have the lowest latency possible to this IP. Right now I have my sever hosted in AWS Oregon and when I do traceroute I can see it does multiple hops to reach this CloudFlare IP.
 How can I reduce latency and even get to this IP address with only one hop? (I know this is possible since other people connecting to the same IP are already doing it) Will I need some kind of colocation service within NWAX, a cable, or a direct connection? (Sorry I'm a big networking noob)
 Thank you.

 - Backup / restoration of data 
 - Windows 10 / 11 installations 
 - L1 / L2 level of issues

 - Also thinking of smart tech support 
 I would buy my own domain and get this all setup but like I said, I just want to cover my ass before I start. 
 Also, how to properly handle sensitive data based on GDPR? Eg. how long to keep data after a backup has taken place?

When everything is connected it works. But if I shutdown one link between router and switch traffic does not switch to the remaining link for half of the devices.

 So for Group B my Dynamic Group Filter is: 
 user.memberof -any (group.objectId -in ['3e14ea14-84bf-429b-98e6-f2289dcced9c']) - and (user.surname -match "^[A-M]")

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, MSRC updated more information on the two zero-day vulnerability attacks on Exchange Server and required mitigation steps for customer guidance. Through the blog, besides various mitigations, their foremost recommendation is to disable the remote PowerShell access for non-admin users.
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/customer-guidance-for-reported-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in/ba-p/3641494
 Currently, we can see similar attacks made by tricky cybercriminals in almost every place, be it on-premise or the cloud. Every crime initiates with going over all the organization information to uncover the weakest links in the security chain to creep in their attack. Thus, their key target would be standard users, as getting their credentials using password spray or purchasing via cybercriminal economy becomes effortless.
 Few days back, I wrote a blog with the steps to restrict users' access to the Azure AD portal. When considering Office 365 environment, the organization info will be scattered and viewable through multiple places like Azure AD portal, PowerShell, MS Graph, etc.But, many Redditors commented it was invalid and unnecessary as it is a directory. 
 Though it is a directory and non-admins have access to it, do they really use portal.azure.com or PowerShell to view Azure information? Even a single loophole make the attack worse. Moreover, why shouldn't we restrict them from accessing crucial information when we can do it? What's the point in letting the weakest security link be active right before our eyes? Isn't it essential to restrict them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody, i have an issue with some Aruba CX Virtual.10.07.0004 version.
 To give some context, i'm making a lab on EVE-NG to create static VXLAN tunnels. I made IPv4 underlay with OSPF and BGP, and everything works fine, I can reach every Routing devices. Also the VXLAN tunnels seems to be up, with the command "sh int vxlan 1" i can see the other vtep-peer IP adn MAC address on the other side of the topology. I'm going through the process following guides and the official Aruba documentation https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.07/PDF/5200-7890.pdf
 Onto the switches which are vteps i've created vlan 50 and associated it to vni 100. Then i went on the interfaces where i have VirtualPCs attached, i put them in "no routing" and then into "vlan access 50" (obv i enter "no shutdown" command). So this is only L2 configuration, no routing interested here. I gave ip addresses to the vpcs 172.16.0.10/24 and 172.16.0.15 /24. They're in the same subnet but CANNOT ping, giving me "host not reachable" as feedback.
 I replicated the vlan configuration on Aruba CX 10.04.0001 version (which NOT support vxlan interfaces) and worked, the vpcs can ping each other.
 Is this a bug for the Aruba CX Virtual 10.07.0004 version or i have misconfigured something? Anyone had same issue? 
 [EDIT] Probably i can confirm it is a BUG. I downloaded 10.05 version, that support vxlan, recreated vlan scenarios and they can ping.

 Windows Server 2019 running as a VM on VMWare sporadically loses network connection. The icon goes to the yellow exclamation point, saying it has no internet and I am not even able to ping the networks' gateway address. The way to "solve" it is by disabling, and enabling the network device. This immediately brings up the network device again and I can ping everything. I have checked that the power settings will not put the device to sleep (which should any way wake up when I log in via the console) . I cannot find ANYTHING in event viewer (probably looking in the wrong place) that would indicate why this happens. There are no events/alarms in VMware either.
 I am at a loss and would appreciate any help I can get.

 What makes me love it is that i can easily add a mail as task. 
 My question is what else do you use to manage your day-to-day tasks and is there any form of notification you can get when you set a reminder on a task? Does it also notify you what your tasks are for the day?

 I'll try keep the story short, I found out that when MTU size is 1500 for IPv6 interface I have problems (some sites unreachable or takes forever to open, speed test on speed.measurementlab.net is abyssal) and if I set it to 1490 it is fixed. The problem is thought, that when I use the command:
 netsh interface ipv6 set subinterface "Ethernet 2" mtu=1490 store=persistent
 it works great, but after a few minutes it is back to 1500 and everything starts breaking again.. Does anybody know how I can make sure it stays 1490 ? I guess there's some "smart" functionality in windows that resets it for some reason ?
 P.S. The interface/subinterface is a "Remote NDIS compatible device" (I'm sharing my 5G mobile internet from my smartphone via USB Tethering if that gives any context.

 ​
 As of saturday all of the VM's on a single Hyper-V host have lost the ability to connect to the internet. Nothing has changed, no updates, no nothing. Eventviewer seems to be clean.
 The Hyper-V host has internet connectivity and we can ping the VM's from the host and from the VM's to the host but that's it. We have checked DNS (it never is DNS but everything in me is screaming it is...), LAN settings, everything... However we still cannot seem to find the issue.
 We even went as far to try and add google DNS or open DNS to one of the servers DNS server to no avail.
 ​
 Any pointers?
 ​
 EDIT (mostly for laughter)...: Router settings somehow got reset and was blasting DHCP over the network. This blocked everything. Turning DHCP off and restarting the servers solved everything. Still weird how nothing about this showed up in eventviewer.

 Basic over view is i have two IPSEC tunnels between my local PA220 and going to a remote headend. Same carrier is providing local WAN access and i can see a successful neighbour at eth1/1 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ethernet1/1 160.242.92.177 50:87:89:e9:fc:b8 ethernet1/1 c 1465

 But when i check the second connection. 
 interface ip address hw address port status ttl

 ​
 I am checking my side configurations and unable to see any routes that may have been missed amd both ends have the same config. During troubleshooting i noticed this above in regard to BGP and ARP neighbours. 
 Is this likely an issue on the neighbour side ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, I read about 802.11y-2008, including the FCC's "light licensing" scheme.
 Do actual, off-the-shelf products that someone can go and purchase as a semi-normal "off the shelf" item actually EXIST? Like, say (in descending order of sophistication & usability):
  
802.11n/ac to 802.11y-2008 router/bridge (so, two could connect to each other via 802.11y-2008, then "normal" wi-fi/ethernet devices could connect to one & communicate with devices connected to the other
 
PCIe (or mPCIe) 802.11y-2008 network card with working drivers for Windows & Linux (so, you could build a PC, install a pair of network cards... one for wi-fi or ethernet, one for 802.11y-2008, install Linux, and configure it AS a homebrew router/bridge).
 
Any half-baked (but working) FCC-approved module that can do 802.11y-2008 & interface via something like SPI, i2c, etc? Yeah, really scraping the bottom of the barrel here...
 
 Once or twice a year, I get in a new mood to see whether 802.11y-2008 finally exists yet. Every time, it seems like 802.11y-2008 has never actually existed anywhere besides as a theoretical paper standard. 
 Am I wrong?
 Example use case: splitting the cost of rarely-needed Starlink with a dozen or so people within a mile or two, shared via 802.11y-2008 backhaul, to bring the per-user-per-month cost down to something sane enough to get "for the hell of it" when some future hurricane knocks the local cellular network out of commission for days or weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: Thank you for the replies. I will ask for a change to cat 6, (he can say yes or no, then it's on him). They're going to work stations mostly but I just added some meeting rooms, etc., unspecified what actual devices they'll be using, assuming a PC per person. I'll do 2 per workstation. Cost isn't an issue as it's fake and the budget is almost irrelevant, just need to justify the design. 
 I'm in a networking course and part of the class is to design a medium-sized business network. We have never covered the logistics of physically laying out cables, business standards, parts necessary, etc. yet all of this is required for the assignment. So I apologize for this low level question but I have 0 real-world experience. The assignment specifies cat5e.
 My question is, when running the cat5e cables out, is there a standard number of cables per destination (to rooms, workstations, etc.), or should it be exactly as many as needed? Is it 1:1 end component per cable (like if a room is expected to have 5 PCs, should there be 5 cat5s, extra? twice as many?)?
 I've tried googling this and watched videos of people but I still haven't figured out a specific answer. I've read all the rules, I think this question is allowed. You don't have to explain it like I'm 5, I just literally don't know what real businesses do.

 Is this a common theme everywhere? Or just a specific trend I've encountered? 
 If this is common, I'm guessing it's because everybody is always quick to blame "the network" and spending half their time proving that the faults are in fact. Not a network problem. Which I understand, it's just a frustrating when they get cagey, especially as once we're off work topics they tend to open up and actually talk to you easily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sys Admins of Reddit it’s been a year since I learned how to check the uptime on our company laptops. This year I learned that many help tickets come from users who go days, weeks, and months without restarting or shutting down their computers.
 Some insist they are shutting down, but the uptime logs states different. The high score I recorded so far is 135 days of uptime. I’ve had users complain they’re falling behind because of their computers performance speed. Users who don’t restart because restarting takes forever to boot. Users who insist they tried restarting multiple times before reaching out to the help desk. There are many examples but my favorite come from power users who try to resolve the problem without restarting thus making the issue more complex.
 I share with you all my journey of enlightenment. Though it may sound annoying, I love my career field.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone said sub going downhill thought I'd post this? Anyone use the sysinternal? 
 I use them at work and they've always come in useful. While working I'll sometimes put Mark Russinovich Case of the Uxexplained talks on and listen to them in background. Nearly all the time I'll suddenly hear a bit I've never noticed before.
 Remember in the old company I was in we had a weird issue on laptops only. Still on XP (they were behind. Was in about 2012) The user would go to explorer and the laptops would freeze for about 5 mins. Then eventually the network drives would appear. I'd grab process monitor traces where I could but instead of giving me time to look our manager would say "Just rebuild them. Don't waste time". Rebuilding them was a cocking waste of time.
 Eventually her own laptop got hit with the issue just as she was going on leave. So convinced her to let me look at hers. Ran process monitor as it happened but couldn't see anything obvious so ran process explorer. Just like in Task Manager you could see explorer at 50% but we all know task manager is useless. Looked into the explorer deeper with procexp and could see one .dll it was using running at 50%
 Ooo, could it be that? The .dll was being used by PGP the software we used to encrypt the laptops. Googled what the .dll did. All it did was scan the network looking for encrypted files so it could change their icon. We never used encrypted files so wasn't needed & apparently there were rare issues with it. So I unregistered it.
 Problem solved. Now instead of having to rebuild the laptops that took quite a while, I could fix them in under 5mins.
 I still take traces of issues wherever I can to look at them later. Started to build up a collection now and keep notes with the traces where I used the tools to fix issues.

 VM1 advertises fdad:23e:f50::/48
 VM2 advertises fdba:54:32::/48

 VM2 configuration:
 protocol ospf v3 wg6 { ipv6 { export all; }; area 0 { interface "wg.4242421477"; interface "wg.stub"; }; } 
 VM3 configuration
 protocol ospf v3 wg6 { ipv6 { export all; }; area 0 { interface "wg.stub"; interface "ens192"; }; }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working in IT since 2018. I've found that I don't like talking to 2-3 dozen different people every day (I feel drained after talking to too many people). I want to work in the background and maintain things from a position where I don't need to speak to anyone but my dept and maybe anyone I pass by on my way into work.
 I know there are other branches in the IT field, but I'm looking for something new to spark up my interest in IT again (my interest has been waning). 
 So my question: What are other branches of this field I can go into where I don't need to be client-facing and answering the same six questions for eight hours a day? Or alternatively what are other fields where my knowledge/experience is transferable?

 I've been following this sub for a while but I have never posted anything.
 I request the help of a good soul to understand :) 
 Let me detail the situation : I am currently building a game server with i9 10850k and I am looking for a motherboard. I have choosen one, the SuperMicro X12SCA-F (pictured here) but I have some questions about adding a 10 GB network card on it.
 I have already an ASUS NVMe PCIe x16 Card, which allows me to add up to 4 NVMe Drives (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 lanes) destined to be mounted on the first PCIe slot (X16).
 Consequently, the 2nd PCIe x16 slot will be disconnected. Which leaves me one PCIe x4 Slot.
 I have found this Intel x550 T1 PCIe 3 x4 that seems to be ok to pair with, but I have 2 questions before I click to buy it :
 1 – How will a NIC plugged on this slot affect the latency of my internet connection since it is linked to the MB chipset (PCH) and not directly to the CPU ?
 2 – Is this slot shared with the M.2 slot or anything else ? In other words, do I have to expect some troubles or bottleneck from using this slot for my purpose ?
 Thanks a lot for your reply!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I'm the proud owner (haha) of a VPS that I'm intending to use as a thin client to access my machines over the net. So far, after checking my options, I'm leaning towards a solution including a VPN (probably OpenVPN over Wireguard due to the firewalls), Guacamole, and a Let's Encrypt autorenewal system to SSL' the whole thing.
 Process would be : connect machine A to VPN, use Guacamole on VPS, use VPN on VPS to connect to machine A.
 I'm now pondering what would be the best solution to handle this - and I like Docker quite a bit. So I'm asking here if there is a "full solution" already available for Docker (for what I searched, it's always "bits" : either there is VPN + Guacamole, either Guacamole + LetsEncrypt, etc. but not the whole thing), if I should install it on the machine without Docker, or if I should make my own Dockerfile.
 This is considering I want to set up some OTP (at least) to guard the thing off.
 What do you guys think? What would you suggest? Is there something easier?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 apparently there is a function in the MS Office applications to send an email with the spreadsheet directly from the application (now I know it).
 Last month (a week after the August patches were applied) the first user from company A complains that this function does not work and an authentication window appears. -> enter AD credentials -> "general error - restart microsoft excel", window appears again. Tried domain-netbios\username, username@domain-fqdn and username only. Since it's not really a critical function, just dragging and dropping the file from File Manager into Outlook, I decided to put the ticket on hold until I have time to investigate.
 Today (Sunday) the 2nd manager of company B called me that this is not working, tried the same -> no success.
 My findings so far:
 - All systems with issues are Windows 2016 Server with Office 2016 (sometimes 32 bit, sometimes 64 bit), September Windows and Office patches applied, both RDS farms and Citrix systems.
 - The issue may have been introduced with the August patches and has not been fixed with the September patches.
 - Sending an email from Word works fine, Outlook opens and the user can write their message.
 - it's not user specific it's maschine-wide
 - it seems that only customers with on prem exchange have problems, IMAP / POP seems fine, exchange online is not used by our customers, so i can't test.
 - Googling was not really helpful -> only old articles with reinstalling Office.
 ​
 Does anyone else have a similar problem? Anyone have any ideas ?
 ​
 Edit: All systems are fully OnPrem with also fully patched DCs; If I add an pop / imap account to the outlook profile and make it the default one everything works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have just spend a whole day trying (and failing) to implement an internal CA setup. One offline Root and one intermediary to issue certs. I was following one or two guides I found on the internet.
 Turns out, internet outdates way too quickly. A test cert I issued to a website got outright rejected by Google Chrome (with no option to move forward) despite having the whole cert chain imported to my system. 
 I ran a cert lint tool on the certs using online (https://crt.sh/lintcert) tool, and it spew out so many errors, I was questioning my ability as a sysadmin. 
 I won't go into details of what the errors are since they are pointless at this stage. But stuff like mandatory Subject alternative names, and the abolishment of CNs, requirement for policy extensions, are some of the few things that have changed over the past few years, and none of the guides I used bothered to address any of this either.
 Hence, my question is, do any of you guys have a good reference guide that I can follow to create an internal CA the way the internet overlords intended in the current day and age, since apparently all the guides I have followed on the internet are all very much outdated. 
 And yes, I am aware I can bypass these warnings by manual adding to chrome, and using secret codes or whatever, but remember that this is going to be used in a real production environment so such work arounds are not a permanent solution. 
 P.S. For OpenSSL only please. I don't want to touch Windows ADCS.

 Going to be implementing a Root CA with ICAs for a company network and need some advice.
 The Root CA will be offline (it will live within XCA) and the ICA will be a Windows Enterprise CA.
 The certs will mainly be issued for machine auth, smart card auth and simple https web servers.
 What are the best practices today with regards to key type and cert expiry? Is RSA-2048 enough? I was thinking of going EC (ed25519) but apparently this has compatibility problems.
 How long does my RCA and ICA expiry need to be?
 I've seen the occasional 99 year RCA expiry but that can't be the right way to do things.
 I know that individual certs for websites can't be more than 398 days, but how about the rest?
 Would love to hear what you guys are doing.
 Thank you so much!

Something I’ve been wanting to do recently is see if it might be possible to write a custom host-based IDS in Python to analyze capture files for “indicators of compromise”. I was wondering if there are any straightforward parsing methods I could apply to a capture file that might simulate an IDS but instead using Pyshark? Maybe I just need to look into Wireshark forensics and copy those techniques? I’m new to all of this so if I sound naive, it’s because I am. If this sounds ridiculous or infeasible please let me know.

 Wondering if anyone has come across a solution to Sign-out Disconnected Users on Workstations after specified amount of time eg 8 hours. 
 I work at a hospital where we have multiple Nurses/Doctors signing into multiple computers and not logging out after their done for the day and account lockouts are a problem when it comes time for password changes or forgotten passwords. 
 Unfortunately turning off "switch user" is not an option as much as I'd love to. 
 There is an option in group policy for this exact problem but it only exists for Remote Desktop Servers... Great.
 Policy for Reference:
 Computer Configuration=> Administrative Templates=>Windows Components=>Remote Desktop Services=>Remote Desktop Session Host=>Session Time Limits.

 Any input would be much appreciated, Cheers Legends

Mine updated on September 23rd and ever since then, I’m experiencing a CPU usage spike when I click on my start menu (windows 10) or when I view my hidden taskbar icons. I’m so confused as to why Trusteer has anything to do with my taskbar but I understand the overbearing bloat that it is. Don’t think I can afford to uninstall it at this point though

 I run a tech software company where we have been using webmail built into shared Linux hosting for our clients.
 As you can imagine, the IPs are all on various blacklists and it's getting difficult.
 I'm looking at setting up an AWS EC2 server to use as an email server for all my clients. Would love and appreciate any suggestions on how I should do this, which software I can use and if there's a better option than EC2.
 We're a small company so would like to keep costs low.
 Thank you

 ​
 What different data can be collected from a given computer system and represented as JSON to be sent to the central server periodically ?
 ​
 I've been able to come up with the following list till now:
 - Hostname
 - OS
 - OS version/kernel version
 - Total disk space
 - Available disk space
 - IP address
 - Open ports
 - Current running processes
 - Battery percentage
 - CPU utilization over the last "x" hours
 - Users
 ​
 What else can be added ? It's for a group project and there are no fixed criteria

Does anyone know if there is another vendor's NAS that has the ability for me to just move the disks into their device and recover the array? If not it wasn't the most important data in the world and I have cloud backups of the important stuff, but it's quite a bit to download. 
 It's a 5 bay Drobo 5N, so I'm looking to replace it as well. Something like a Synology or QNAP. Any suggestions? If someone tells me TrueNAS is a possibility I'll do that as well, I've been looking for a reason to build a new server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working in IT for a while now, about 10 years ago I started my apprenticeship.
 And for the first time, I honestly feel like I am being paid what I am worth!
 I start Monday and it feels great, I have had a few roles in that time and each time I felt like I went for a “safe” role and when I started I soon realised that I could do a lot more than my job description. (Mainly think that is because some job job descriptions are far more broader than you actual responsibilities, if I saw SQL database, I would assume I needed to be a SME)
 Now I have gained some pretty desirable skills (such as PowerShell, Microsoft 365 expert, Cloud knowledge, etc) I went for a £50k role with no hesitation, it will be challenging but in a good way.
 And I feel like I will be far more motivated knowing I am getting a salary worth my knowledge, skills and experience.
 I also have been offered contract work on the side, which I’ve always felt IT was hard to side hustle.
 But my PowerShell and modern workplace knowledge has been very desirable as of late. All that training paid off!
 So this post is just to say… go for it, as long as you are willing and train when required, maybe that role your eyeing up will work for you.
 Wish me luck!

 Apologize in advance for my poor english skills, it is not my first language. However, I hope you could help with my issue:
 I have to update the company's DC so I did set up a a new DC with Win2022 as secondary DC, joined to the AD forest, and make sure the replication of AD Sites and Services, DNS, and GPOs were fine. The old one is a Win2012, I kept both running for a while, until I had some free time to decommission the old one.
 Finally, today I did transfer all the FSMO roles to the secondary DC make it as primary, the old DC is hosting the DNS server as well, so I added the new DC to each Forward Lookup Zone FQDN and changed the DNS in the network settings pointing our AWS Route53 (which I don't manage). At first, until the old DC was online and after I transferred the FSMO roles, all the clients and workspaces were able to resolve the new DC as DNS server, the group policies update correctly, everything looks fine. 
 Unfortunately, after I shut down the old DC, the new DC could not resolve out domain and lost the all the metadata it replicated before. Starting back the old DC resolved the issue, and everything went back to normal.
 Now I don't know what exactly where the issue is, I suspect this is something to do with the DNS but I really don't know what I missed.
 Thank you for your help!

 WiFi is Ruckus, about 250 APs. We’re not using tunnelling because of some issues with tunnelling.
 The issue we’re seeing is a drop of a couple of seconds whenever the handset roams from an AP connected to a switch to an AP connected on another switch. Roaming between APs on the same switch is fine.
 Has anyone here ever seen this issue? Is the 5406 that slow at updating its bridge forwarding table or is there some config/firmware issue?

 What do you do when you receive malware alert from one of your company workstation by antivirus alert server? 
 are you going to do manual scan by yourself ? or you do remote scan from the antivirus server ? 
 ​
 i am facing big problem here that my manager asking me to do a scan with 3 different sw's ( malwarebytes , KVRT and Mcafee antivirus ) 
 this means that i have at least 5 pc's every day to do the same process but i am really not convinced at all to do this .. this task should be automated ... at least to do remote scan from the antivirus portal .. that's why we have a centralized system for antivirus ( Mcafee EPO ) .. but they are forcing me to do manual scan at every singe pc in the company while we have more than 500 computers in the company . 
 what is the correct process we have to follow ? or what is the process you are doing at your company ? 
 ​
 sorry for my bad English and i hope my question and my point understandable .

 We used 3 of the mentioned open source compromised apps as of today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have just been doing networking for about a year, and have a decent understanding of VLANs. I was hoping someone could help me understand it on a larger scale though. Where all is a VLAN doing a push/pop through multiple hops? Does it have to do it at each hop, or can the trunk make it forward through a hop depending on configuration? The example im working with is through this network:
 Vlan 101.100 Nokia 7750 lag-2 > Nokia 7250 IXR-E Port 13 > Ciena 5142 Port 5> Ciena 3916 port 1 > CPE
 If someome could help explain through a network diagram they understand, with other MARs that would be fine also.

 Recently I assigned 6 new /16 supernets to some new Azure regions and it got me wondering if I will eventually run out of space... the thing is, after pondering it for a while, I realized that my organization would need to 10x in size before I even use up the 10.0.0.0/8 block...
 I imagine the mega corporations of the world may have a usecase, but from SMB up to some of the largest enterprises - it seems like adding unnecessary complexity with basically no gains.
 Here in the UK its very, very rare I come across an entry to intermediate level network engineer who has done much with IPv6 - and in fact the only people I have worked with who can claim they have used it outside of their exams are people who have worked for carriers (where I agree knowing IPv6 is very important).

 The customer has a Dell N3024 and has already a legacy VMware infrastructure connected to it using aggregation. Since his license is the Essentials Plus, it doesn't support Distributed Virtual Switches, only Standard Virtual Switches then I'm not able to use LACP, only static link aggregation.
 I set up the balancing mode to IP hash-based, I've defined as active the 3 uplink interfaces on the virtual switch. As soon as I activate the aggregation, I'm unable to ping the management interface until I undo it. I also think it's not a VLAN problem because the customer runs almost everything on the default VLAN. Is there some trick in Dell switches that needs to be done to the static link aggregation work properly with VMware? I'm asking it because we first tried to do the same configuration on a Dell PowerConnect 2824 and it also didn't work, then we moved the connections for this other switch where his legacy infrastructure is connected, but it isn't working also. Any ideas?
 Thanks in advance and have a nice weekend.

 I got a challenge with a new service of IPTV streaming source which is feeding from the access port of the provider's switch. It is L2 port without any IP address.
 The requirement is to push this stream source to all buildings which are connected via various L3 switches running ComwareOS, ArubaOS, ArubaOS-CX and Cisco IOS. I don't wanna use a single VLAN spanning across these buildings so I prefer to use a multicast routing protocol - pim dense mode.
 The problem is that how can I route multicast traffic from L2 VLAN to pim-dm protocol?! Can you please give me a suggestion/advice to archive this goal?

 What are the ramifications for renewing this thing? If I get the Enterprise Administrator cert, should I even worry about renewing the Messaging Administrator one or just let it go? Does it cost a lot for renewing? 
 I've only been in the industry for 2 years and I'm trying to transition to the systems/cloud administration side of things, helpdesk is far too easy, and I love working with Windows Server, Azure and 365 and was curious of anyone who perhaps has the MS100/101 cert how long is it valid for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have about 80TB of NVME storage on a Windows Server (We chose Windows Server because we just weren't able to get reliable >10gbs transfers via TrueNAS or ProxMox or TrueNAS Scale over SMB to Windows 10 clients.)
 We are looking for a service that we can self-host all of our data, in place with a sync client for Mac and PC that lets you see virtual\files on demand. 
 Synology Drive Server is working for us now. But it requires maintaining a completely redundant copy of all of the data on a Synology NAS just to be able to serve the data over Synology Drive. We use Syncthing to keep our Windows<>Synology in lock step and it's working but it's a fragile arrangement and requires redundant storage. 
 Sharepoint Server is the obvious choice for a cloud file server, however for just 8 users Sharepoint Server is $7,200/license + $150/user CAL = $16,000 it's from a cost perspective more expensive than buying a 250TB TrueNAS server and just doing the Syncthing dance.
 Resilio technologically looks great, but we only have 8 users and in order to get a Windows Server license you need at least 20 users which means we would be paying $200/mo. 
 OwnCloud and NextCloud offer exactly what we need, but back in 2017 they abandoned Windows. We could run them in a hypervisor, but then we'll need to duplicate the data into the VM and double our storage. 
 Qsync in QuTScloud would let us host a QNAP OS image in Hyper-V for a reasonable price per year but would also require us to duplicate our storage in the VM which means double the costs for hard drives. 
 Is there someone I'm missing who works with Windows Server and doesn't have crazy enterprise rates assuming that 80TB will only ever be needed by multinational corporations?

 HR didn't even notify me...I had to email asking for an update. And they just replied, "it was denied.' Had to reply for more information, the reply was.. "Job was rescinded." 
 This just seems like shady work by the HR employee.

 Problems started when we started doing L3 routing + VXLAN and started loading up the switch with DAC cables when we started plugging in our Dev servers, and all our "Servers" (repurposed old workstations with 10GE cards). and started running Iperf 
 switches started locking up. Reboot is the only way to get it to respond. Disabling VXLAN fixes the issue. 
 We emailed the account manager and she got someone involved ASAP, they didn't even ask for any logs or TSRs and said it was a memory leak and sent us a new firmware that fixed the problem, 
 The fact of the matter is I've seen and heard of similar issues with Cisco switches, and routers that cost a lot more, what are your thoughts on this? 
 Personally, I don't think I will use this for prod or dev, and hope I can convince management to give me one so I can use it in my home lab :D.

 I email our dell distributor and say hey let me get two 4TB drives for an R410. He sends them over and I pop them in the server. Get into the configuration utility and it isn’t recognizing the drives. It is showing the drives as failed. 
 I think that’s crazy that he sent me two failed drives but hey anything can happen. He sends me two more drives and boom those both say failed. At this point I get a supervisor involved after I try everything with the drives I can think of. 
 He takes one look at it and says, “Those are SAS drives and this server uses SATA. You got the wrong drives”
 Facepalm…….
 A quick google search reveals that you can use SATA with a SAS connector but not the other way around. A lesson I will never forget! 
 Luckily the customer wasn’t in a rush and my supervisor was cool about it besides laughing at me lol but I kinda deserve. Any other young inexperienced guys learn from my mistake on this one!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone else is going to run into this request, and the vendor's documentation is very frustrating. So here are some tips to help you along the way. 
 The Lexis Nexis has enabled support for modern auth in the Time Matters Exchange Sync tool, but in their article https://community.pclawtimematters.com/pclaw16/s/article/Exchange-Sync-ModernAuth
 they don't give you any information on the API permissions required. Instead, they direct you to ask a Certified Partner. 
 I wish they just said "The API needs to write/read the mailboxes using EWS with OAuth authentication" or really any indication of the required function/permissions.
 ​
 So, if you're trying to set this up: 
  
Install at least TM 16.6
 Create an Enterprise application in Azure, create a corresponding client secret
 Verify that OAuth2 is enabled for the tenant
 You need permissions for the API to Exchange Web Services using full_access_as_app
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-authenticate-an-ews-application-by-using-oauth#configure-for-app-only-authentication
 Reconfigure the Exchange sync on the server with the API values and verify the connection
 
 Hope this saves someone else some time. I wasted too much effort on this today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm setting some new Dell R650 servers, a couple of PowerSwitch switches and a Power store SAN. The Dell switches are configured for L2 and have trunk port connections to some L3 Cisco switches. I haven't worked with Dell equipment in years and my current employer has been an HP and Cisco shop in the past.
 So the servers have 2 dual 25GB port network cards, 1 port on each card is setup for Data and 1 port is setup for ISCSI/Vmotion/Vmanagement. I'm trying figure out when I should be using the VLT port channels with the connections.
 Should I use them for?
 1 - Two Data connections to each server
 2 - Two ISCSI/Vmotion/Vmanagement connections to each server
 3 - Two Trunk ports from the Dell switches to the Cisco L3 switches
 4 - For the Powerstore, it would seem like if you have only 1 connection per node, you would not use
 VLT? 
 Should I use two ports on each node and associate the two connections on each node with a VLT port channel?

 No complaints at all with EdgeConnect. Did everything I ever needed of it, simple enough to troubleshoot.
 ​
 Not a fan of Fortigate due to the fact it's a firewall by nature - Hence asymmetric traffic is dropped unless asymroute is enabled which is a large security risk for organizations running a single device/VDOM (and with iBGP and ECMP there's a lot of it during DR events....)
 ​
 So - What is everyones thoughts?

 Spanning tree is on, happy and has been for 12+ months. Guy in remote office was moving furniture and not only found an 8 port cisco switch plugged in (not documented by people before me) but unplugged the POE on the bridge. Whatever, right?
 My entire network hiccuped for a good 5-10 seconds. HP Switches show entry of ‘Unit 1 elected as new STP root’. Ok.
 So, for the fun of it, I had the guy unplug the Ethernet on the POE, just to see what happens…and sure enough, 4-8 pings drop on my entire network. 
 I would have thought nothing would have happened on my end of things (main office), but it did. I want to blame this old cisco SG250 switch, which I looked up and shows STP on out of the box. But Im not sure.
 Ive ordered up a new HP switch to replace it, and it should be here in a few days, but im just wondering what is going on and asking you guys for some insight if you have any. Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I apologize if this has been asked before, but trying to search this topic I am finding a lot of results not exactly related to my questions that have been bothering me the past few days.
 I am having a difficult time comprehending the difference between untagged and "no-untagged" on an HP switch. I want to be sure I am understanding what the configuration means, and I'm not just continuing to copy what I see just because it works. I do understand how vlans and tagging work for forward traffic and separate it between different subnets. Something "tagged" for a vlan I understand fine. But when doing a show run on an HP switch, I am seeing the labels "no untagged" and "untagged" listed, and that is throwing me off. 
 When I see the words "no untagged" it makes me think that a port that is untagged cannot be part of this vlan (therefore only tagged ports can go here), and untagged means they are not part of that vlan. But then again, why would anyone need to specify a port is untagged? Wouldn't it be implied it is untagged on that vlan unless it is manually tagged?
 Below is an example (keep in mind, I didn't set these up):
 vlan 1
 name "DEFAULT_VLAN"
 no untagged 1-22,25-52
 untagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 5
 name "MGMT"
 tagged 23-24
 exit
 vlan 9
 name "PC"
 untagged 1-2,4-10,12-15,18-22,26-40
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 10
 name "DATA"
 untagged 3,11,16-17,25,41-52
 tagged 1,23-24,28-40
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 11
 name "VOICE"
 tagged 1,23-24,26-40
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 12
 name "SecWIFI"
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 13
 name "GuestWIFI"
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address

 And then something happens, which throws a wrench into everything and makes me second guess everything. 
 Today that was me. I came to work, no-touch-Fridays and got through some tasks, and my nagios screen went red. Like…a lot of red.
 Came back about 2 minutes later…weird.
 About and hour later, same thing. This time I could see a pattern of what was down…a remote site and everything AFTER it went down. I called the site, no answer, which is normal sometimes people are not there. 
 I start logging into switches, seeing some Spanning Tree stuff in the logs, nothing too out of sorts. Sweating a bit, wondering wtf is going on…do I know spanning tree enough (does anyone?) whats going on here. 
 About another hour goes by and I finally get a callback. The site was moving furniture and powered everything down..including the ‘splitter’. The what? You don’t have a switch there. Turns out the people before me put in a 8 port switch and stuck it behind the desk. I look it up, its a smart-ish switch with spanning tree, and older than dirt. No documentation saying its there, or what its doing. But its powered back up and everything is working much better now. 
 Monday they get a new switch…but until then I need to calm down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today started out as a seemingly quite Friday. One of those nice and easy coast till the end of the day Friday’s. Until someone comes in your office and has to mention their desk phone and Ethernet isn’t working. We use POE sip phones in the office btw. Well what do you mean the phone isn’t working, is their no dial tone? No he says, the phone has no power at all. 
 This immediately peaked my interest with a small side of anxiety and dread as to what I might discover. So I walk over to that side of the office. We have a whole floor of a building and this was on the opposite side from my office. We have 3 core Poe switches on our side and have a fiber circuit running too a single 48 port poe switch. 
 Too make the long story short, the single Poe switch decided to kill itself. Luckily we got a few data only ports to work for the printers. Otherwise the marketing team would have murdered us. So not the end of the world, but I swear it’s always on a damn Friday. A few years ago we got hit with ransomeware towards the end of the day…on a Friday. That was fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, Long time lurker here - 
 I've recently received an opportunity, and I'm not sure what to do with it. 
 I chanced into my IT role at my work, and it's a government job with a pension at the end of it. The crew is great, and I have awesome work/life balance (which is why I joined in the first place). But, the pay stinks (I knew this going in, I had a 30% pay cut from my previous employer), even though we are in a union. 
 Received a call with our main vendor for our computer database system and are curious if I would like to join them for 2x my current pay (35k) (which isn't a lot, I'm on food stamps) and the work would be remote. 
 My chief worry is the economy. Sure the job doesn't pay well, but it's secure. And I fear a possible recession. I see advice on this thread all the time that the best way to get a raise is to change jobs, but I've also been reading that now may not be a great time to do so. 
 And, I'm a loyal employee, loyal to a fault, which in the United States, I know conceptually, is a very bad thing to be, but I still feel emotionally that I'm betraying the trust of my coworkers and team. 
 I'm scared to even ask for more details on the job offer. I'm stressed now, due to my family finances, so I'm worried that I may make a rash move. 
 Sigh, any advice is appreciated.

 I got a position in the company I've been in for the past decade, but still kept my LLC active for larger consulting jobs I get every now and then.
 I've been getting a few referrals for medical and dentistry practices, which involve HIPAA. Since there are no official definite guidelines for security standards (that I know of), there is a lot of price negotiation and options when I'm in the analysis and design phase. For instance, moving the server/network rack (which is currently a shelf and desk in the water/air pump closet without a locking door) into a lockable, secure cabinet.
 So, I've been wondering if anyone knows my liability exposure for any "compromises" I make in the design and if anyone has insurance for things like this, or something else.

 So I passed my CCNA in February and then got a decent Network Admin job right after. It's insanely clear that the CCNA was not nearly enough to consider myself a good Network Admin and I'm learning stuff every day but I want to actually study things so I know it in advance or know topics better before I learn through screwing something up and having a higher level Network Admin save me.
 My job is almost purely in Cisco ASA, dealing with VPN troubleshooting. I decided to study a concentration exam in VPNs for CCNP but I'm noticing I still have issues understanding things like NAT/PAT and more advanced routing (not routing protocols, just routing in general). I feel I have a great deal of understanding in how these things work but once I start troubleshooting individual issues I become lost quickly.
 Are there any suggestions on study materials? Books or exams to go for, YouTube videos that helped you understand specific topics much better?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently a sysadmin who has been approached by a head of another department offering me an opportunity to be one of his many project managers.
 He's aware I have zero PM experience but must've heard good things about me, coupled with a good impression he has of Mr through the limited dealings we've had with each other.
 He's told me he's approached me because he thinks I've got the soft skills required to flourish in the role, and has assured me that I can be brought up to speed as a junior PM and I won't be thrown in at the deep end.
 My salary would remain the same, he's already done the ground work with upper management to ensure I wouldn't get a paycut despite going from senior sysadmin to junior PM.
 The role itself sounds like something I'd enjoy and it seems a good opportunity I otherwise wouldn't get to experience something completely different.
 Has anyone here made a similar switch, or have any thoughts? 
 I'm seriously considering it as I have some insider information that our PMs have a much higher earning potential in my org. Many of them earn more than my boss, so I already feel like I may be hitting the ceiling in this role as far as growth is concerned.
 My main concern would be my skills in this industry fading should I wish to return/end up disliking PM roles, but the fact the company will bring me up to speed and the earning potential is higher is making me think I should really consider this and take the (seemingly low) risk.
 Any input greatly appreciated! 
 Thanks all and have a great weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am learning those by doing because I have to configure two VSX pairs of 8325 to power my current and a new datacenters. Fortunately I have some time for experimenting so I am trying to do things using all the new & hot stuff. I need to have the same vlans accessible in both datacenters so I've configured evpn vxlan using ibgp and everything is working as expected except symmetric IRB with distributed gateways. The routing tables on both clusters show only connected routes while bgp evpn table seems to be OK. I would appreciate some tips.
 If someone wants to look at configs:
 DC1-CORE1
 DC1-CORE2
 DC2-CORE1
 DC2-CORE2
 and a diagram 
 For now I can ping over vlan 100 and 200 between DCs but not between vlans. As I learned until now routing should be done by EVPN Type 5 routes and the are visible on all switches.

Also they are a Windows shop and we are 100% Linux, so they test it on Windows, it works, then when I install Linux on it, it don't work, and we have to spend a load of time getting it working. What I am looking for is a UK vendor who will test using Linux and preferably install linux according to our instructions - We are totally happy to pay them extra for doing this, as our time is worth a lot. We typically buy EPYC 7003 Milan servers, so that kind of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have the option of purchasing a VPS with a 100Mbps connection and another with a 1Gbps connection. I’m creating an application that communicates with a fintech API and latency is key. So far, I have obtained a 1.2 ms latency to the target API’s server using the 100Mbps, which is ideal. However, I am wondering if latency is a good enough measurement or if there will be significant advantages of using the 1Gbps connection. Each payload is around 2Kb.
 Would there be a huge difference between the 100Mbps connection and the 1Gbps given that the ping latency is around 1.2ms on both?
 If there isn’t a significant difference, I’d rather pay for the 100Mbps VPS as it is substantially cheaper, and this is a personal project.

 Today i have a problem with a dell r720xd server.
 To clarify: the hardware and software of this server have not been modified.
 I get a message that says "Configuring memory" I try rebooting from iDRAC and esxi boots fine. When it is working for a while I see the esxi turned off again in my monitoring and when I enter through the remote console I find the "configuring memory" again In IDRAC it tells me that all the hardware is fine without any apparent error in the logs.

 Anyone know what might be happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last year I've seen an increasing amount of spam originating from Gmail. I'll go so far as to say Gmail appears like a haven for spammers. Since Gmail holds a huge chunk of the worlds email accounts/domains, I can't resort to my standard blocklist approach, and spam is seeping through my other filters and ends up with users.
 I've tried reporting the spam to abuse accounts such as [abuse@gmail.com](mailto:abuse@gmail.com). That did nothing except get one of our mailservers on a gmail blocklist (lots of lost emails). (I can't 100% guarantee there was a correlation, but the timeline fits very well..) I've tried to report through web forms as well, but most are focused towards spam coming into gmail from the outside.
 Does Gmail just don't give a shit, or is there a way to get something done?

Initially I noticed there were a lot of CRC errors on the interface so we changed the cable which seemed to sort the problem. Now though, we have the same error again on the AP portal saying that the AP is unable to reach the cloud. I did a shut/no shut on the interface (which worked prior to changing the cable) but that hasn't helped. The MAC address isn't detected on the port to which it's connected (Cisco switch) and I've tried pinging the but the interface was showing as up/up.
 I then noticed that the speed was 100Mb/s. I've changed that to 1000Mb/s but now the interface is showing as down/down and a shut/no shut isn't bringing it up. All metrics on the interface look fine and nothing at all has changed in terms of configuration. Anything I have missed?

 So i have got a physical SCCM build which i now need to transfer to a virtual environment and create VDPs.I have started working and striping all physical related stuff and leave only the relevant.
 I have got assistance from a Citrix resource however i am not 100% sure they are telling me what the capabilities are and how we can do this optimally. Unfortunately i got no clue about Citrix.
 So we are going to build into the Virtual environment and that machine is gonna be captured and then fed into MCS and then clone it.
 What i am worried about is how do i transfer all the things i have stripped of the main build to the VDP build. For example specific languages. Can i have a PowerShell script run during MCS and do all that? 
 How do you guys go about this kind of challenges ?

 We had an elaborate phishing breach. Led to nothing but will lebaorate on what they did and I want advice of what else we can do, or even buy to help reduce. We are a MS 365 house
 ​
  
User in question is in finance.
 User was recently scammered personally.
 User was tricked (we suspect she may have been using same passwords for everything) to approve MFA. MFA was set as phone. The initial entry point we think they either had tested her password as got from the initial, non company scam or a phshing email pre Avanan being turned onto the max and slipped through MS quarantine.
 Scammer got in (using a IP on same country) and set a rule for correspondance on a "shared finance mailbox"
 2 weeks later...logged in and started correspondance with a cutsomer as set in the rule about bank details.
 Bank details were changed but we got altered and was started.
  
Shared mailbox had 13 plus people in so took me time as shared maiboxes dont have great auditing. Eventually located, blocked, changed passwords, altered MFA, coverted this mailbox to a licensed etc. The whole company is about to have all passwords changed and MFA sessions revoked.
 We already do:
  
Yearly training std
 Atleast 2, if not 3 fake phishing tests a year that lead to extra training
 We have Avanan in place since Sept. Note, was not placed inline till after the initial breach. 
 I block most countries hence how they go in via IP address in this country via a VPN
 Shed load of alerts on 365 but a a since instance, not sure any alert would have trigged unless I do alerts on any rules adding into a mailbox (we have 600+ mailboxes, rising to 2500 shortly.
  
Any AI solution that could help?
 Would EDR/XDR in any way?
 Move shared mailbox correspondances to helpdesk solution eg freshdesk?
 Open to comments as going to present to board what I need and why.
 Thanks in advance.

 Currently trying to work a solution for a client, cisco platform all around - and best idea is to use IPSec VTI tunnels. This particular install is using Starlink business so we should get the public IP direct on the cisco, but we may have a need to do it on residential which is CGNAT stuff with dynamic IP's .
 Whats the best solution here?
 I've previously tried l2tp VPN over residential starlink, and found the tunnel was limited to about ~30mbps, not sure if this was an unrelated issue, but other VPN's to the same concentrator did not have any issues, so I thought perhaps starlink was PCQ the tunnel (seeing it as a single flow).
 Just keen to hear peoples experiences so I can push myself to the right solution.
 Thanks!

So I looked at one of the /25 networks being advertised as a type 5 lsa and saw the the advertising router, the boundary I was one, was hosting that /25 SVI itself! That's where I got confused since the side of the network I could see is area 0. 
 I'm a visual learner and couldn't picture where those type 5s were going and why they exist. Could someone explain this scenario to me?

 We have 2 different SFP transceivers and both act the same way. 1 type is generic from Amazon that was supposed to work with most major hardware providers. We brought them along as backups. The primary module is from FS.com and is supposed be PA compatible and has the PA designation like we expected.
 Does anyone in the Phoenix area have any Palo Alto compatible Singlemode 1310nm LX/LR - 10km transceivers with LC connectors? We would need them asap, our flights leave 5pm phoenix time on Friday 9/30.
 Does anyone have any other ideas or access to a vendor in the area that could help?

 Apologies in advance for being pretty new to networking.
 My situation is as the title states.
 How I got here was we are preparing for a merger and we were asked to add the DNS suffixes to the dns search list of our two source domains and our Target domain via GPO
 Doing this seems to cause the primary DNS suffix to be the first one in that search list
 To try and get around that I tried to define the primary as what it should be per domain.
 But after doing that, DNS only seems to be working with FQDN.
 Not sure what is causing this but if anyone has any input I would want to hear it. Thank you!

I check the routing table and I see the route to the subnet the call manager sits in right but there is also a /32 route for the call manager coming from NHRP, we do use DMVPN. 
 Visual with made up IPs
 B 192.168.2.0/24 via 172.16.16.10
 H 192.168.2.10/32 via 172.16.16.2
 So in this example the 172.16.16.10 is the dmvpn address of the call center's router and 172.16.16.2 is the dmvpn address of a secondary headend. 
 Now yes there is also a problem with why the secondary headend we are standing up doesn't have a route to the call center itself, making this just inefficient routing not broken, but I'm mostly confused by how NHRP just decided to advertise a route to a somewhat random server. I just threw a static route in to fix it for now but I would like to figure out the cause.
 This is my first time working at a company with DMVPN so I'm still learning the ins and outs.

We're wanting to set up some VM hosts at a separate site to replicate to for failover so if Site 1 goes down then we can continue to use our VMs at Site 2. These sites are connected via a layer 3 fiber link. Currently the VM hosts and the VMs themselves are all on the same subnet/vlan. Is there a way to recreate that subnet at site 2 or would they conflict with one another since the two sites are still technically connected?

 Is it better to have all the cables drop to the bottom of the rack, and then come back up to feed into the panels, or to feed the cables directly into the panels as they drop down? I've seen it done both ways, so I'm not really sure what the "preferred" method is.

I can get to this box no issues when I'm in prem from different vlan. When I'm vpn'd in i can get to the gateway (10.9.9__1) and a couple other devices in the same network JUST not this particular box. I look at the firewall logs and 80 and icmp are green going to this box. From the ubuntu box i can even ping the vpn box from the ubuntu, not vice versa. I've even tried a win10 laptop, gave it the same IP and i'm not able to get to it thru vpn as well. gave it a different one and it's good! 
 As far as path goes, vpn -> fw-> core -> access switch-> box. the 10.9.9.x network is L2. i'm not a linux guy so i'm not sure if there's an internal (i doubt it because i have access to it on-prem). i'm clearly missing something here. fw rule, routing, something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So at work we've been batting around the whole IPv6 chestnut, for the past year or so. We've gotten to the point that some of our providers don't provide IPv4 anymore unless you cough up a bundle of money, so we want to go IPv6 only. 
 And that's where the fun starts. So many external services we rely on don't support IPv6. Github for one doesn't. Docker's registry doesn't. Most of the CPAN mirrors (yeah, we use Perl in a few places) don't. A lot of Ubuntu's repository mirrors don't. It's actually easier to list the things that *do* support it than the things that don't, it's a sad and very small list. 
 So tell me, how to transit to a full IPv6 stack when 90% of external services flat out don't support it, and (in Github's case at any rate) don't seem too interested in getting it to work?

Our current switching environment is HPE and Aruba based. By default, the ports do not trust DSCP. To enable QoS to give VOIP traffic priority, is it just a matter of enabling DSCP port trust on all switches end to end for it to begin working? Currently, we are not coming anywhere close to saturating our current backbone links, but I'd like to just have QOS setup properly just in case.

We do have great Verizon connections on our phones though so I think some kind of LTE modem would be sufficient. I have worked with Cradlepoint IBR900's in the past and was thinking of just getting one of them. My problem is that our room where the internet and camera equipment will be stored is right in the middle of the home, where the LTE connection suffers.
 ​
 My question is this: Is there an antenna system or something we could use to place the antennas outside on the side of the home and run that back to the IBR900 placed in the middle of the home? Or another solution that would work with this setup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are preparing to deploy a new system. I apologize if I don't word things correctly when trying to explain this, but honestly the most I've done on phones has been static configs and configuring switchports for VoIP VLANs. This rollout we have ESXi, VMs, we're configuring Option 150 on a server, and I need to figure out where to point the ip-helper for the VoIP VLANs (there are about 12 but they should all point to the same whatever will be acting as the DHCP server; my problem is I don't know what that is. On the last setup it was the CME on a Cisco 3925 router. (Sorry if I didn't word that correctly.) I was told specifically by the vendor (Presidio) that it would not point to the router this time, but she didn't know where to point it either. I'm looking for suggestions and your experience in helping me answer the question of where to direct my ip-helper on my VoIP VLAN configs. Our server admin says he configured our internal DHCP scope on a server (on a server VLAN and not a VoIP VLAN, and don't internal DHCP scopes only assign to to those in it's own subnet? ) but the only time I’ve heard of internal DHCP has been for wireless so that doesn’t sound right. I know it’s supposed to be a L3 device but if it’s not the router, then I’m lost again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working as a NOC and I was in the office yesterday using cisco jabber to take phone calls. I could hear the ring and answer the phone call, but 3 times I did with a customer I heard nothing on their end. 
 I checked all jabber settings, my speaker and microphone settings and kept testing it over and over after the first call where I couldn't hear. 
 I was able to dial and talk to team members and make outbound calls and hear them but when a customer would call me I would not hear it. It was bizarre. I know the wifi password was changed a few days prior for some reason at the office. So whenever I received an inbound call from anyone who wasn't on my team I could not hear voice
 When I went back home I was able to hear them when they called. With no settings changed or nothing different.

 This VPN is insanely slow compared to connection speeds and I am having a hard time finding a reason why. Keep in mind I'm a junior sysadmin at best so I'll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. 
 Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.
 Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:
 Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.
 Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.
 CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%
 Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.
 Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.

This is being given to me as a bit of training on managing and implementing IT projects by my IT Director. He is giving me this project as a way to spread my wings and have an opportunity to make seeming in our company that I will "own and manage", a system that will "be by baby to care for". 
 ​
 This is something I haven't had to do before, so I am just trying to get some advice on how to tackle a project like this. Not so much asking for phone system options (although I am open to recommendations), but rather tackling a large IT project in general. Any advice on breaking the project down, or standards for laying things out and planning? What programs do you use to layout plans? Resources for project planning?

 I've come across a frustrating and bothersome networking issue where one of my laptops on the same configured wireless network (5 GHz bandwidth) supposedly gets fast download speeds (208.04 Mbps). However, when put in a real-world scenario of installing a virtual machine like Kali Linux, the time to install and configure is night and day when put side by side on my main laptop. This older laptop model would take a considerable amount of time to download large files from the web or even install a VM. The Kali Linux VM that I downloaded just yesterday took 1-2 hours before being configured and installed. 
 On my main laptop, I get a relatively stable connection to the router as well when downloading (211.34 Mbps). yet, it appears that this laptop has no p…]]></summary>

 So if we are going to run BGP towards the customer, what would be the best practice way of setting it up? iBGP / eBGP towards the customer? iBGP / eBGP between CPE and PE? Or is there some other way of doing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to learn DSC and was using this quickstart by MS: Quickstart - Convert Group Policy into DSC - PowerShell | Microsoft Learn on a standalone VM.
 It uses the PS Module BaselineManagement to create an MOF and PSD1 file from GPO. The PSD1 script output by that process has all the HKLM registry changes under a 'RegistryPolicyFile' type. When I apply the configuration to the VM, it modifies the local GPO Pol file and does a gpupdate, but not all the reg changes are made. No errors or issues, and DSC says its compliant.
 If I edit the PSD1 script by changing all the 'RegistryPolicyFile' to 'Registry' it actually makes the changes.
 Am I missing something here? Why isn't the local pol file working? Should I be leaving the MOF to update the Pol file and troubleshoot local group policy, or should I be editing the script like I am and directly update the registry? Your insight would be appreciated!
 ​
 This is the setting I was troubleshooting. If the reg is present, the user can't change the setting. If I use this as RegistryPolicyFile, the user can change the setting.

We need to factory default them but google is really scarce with any info/manuals for them. We have no logins/passwords. On boot they don't offer or show anything to be able to interrupt boot and have a look there. Called UK office, but they apparently don't deal with issues like that. Has anyone worked with this kit and would be able to help?

 Im struggling with an azure problem for a while now. I have a backup from a server in china that in the past (on different hardware) worked without issue. 
 We've made quite a few changes (none that i think should affect azure as it works on other remote sites without issue) 
 Any how- scenario is, I take a file backup to a azure vault, the backup fails almost immediately if not a few minutes into the job, LSASS on the server crashes forcing a reboot and the cycle repeats. 
 I have tried a different virtual server with the same data same issue. 
 I get an email from azure with this error - 
 The current operation failed due to an internal service error "Authentication Failed". Please retry the operation after some time.
 Which i believe is simply because LSASS fails. 
 I'm looking for some guidance on where to pull a thread as im out of ideas.

 In august, a new employee was onboarded to my company's sister company.
 I was in charge of purchasing his assets.
 I called him and asked what laptop he wanted. 17" he said, because of client visits and being able to have presentations on it when not being able to connect it to a bigger screen.
 Found a model, checked in with him and he said okay to said model.
 Not two hours after the purchase was complete, he called from a store and had seen another model that costed 1k more than the one he chose previously. He wanted that one instead. Informed him that the computer already has been shipped, and if he needed this one instead, he has to contact his manager and get it approved.
 His manager did not approve.
 Of course he needed a phone. No issue there. But he wanted a additional SIM. For his car.
 I obliged and sent him a extra SIM card.
 A couple of days ago he visited our office and had yet a request; he wants an iPad too. Informed him that he has to talk to his manager to get that approved.
 Today, he called. Now he wants another SIM. For his iPad (that I don't know if his managers approval, if he bought it for himself or how he solved it).
 I told him No. Told him to make a hotspot on the iPhone and connect the iPad to said hotspot.
 Now, my manager told me that this guy has a purchase block.
 ​
 This guy's audacity has no bounds.
 What similar experiences do you have?

 The ad-hoc Internet access is easy, I'll use a Teltonika RUT241 and a fixed IP data SIM from a mobile network, but I'm stumped on a camera to use (this not being a full on CCTV system with say Milestone and Hikvison bullet cameras).
 Can anyone recommend a CCTV camera available retail I can use for the above that...
  
Uses Wi-Fi for its network connectivity.
 Has a stream over HTTP so that I can publish this on a port on the fixed IP.
 Can have a low frame rate set, maybe as low as 1 to 5 fps, so that I don't chew through data.

 I just want to confirm what I found is the only way and that there is no GPO setting? 
 To lock the screen setup:
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Configuration 
 There you will see every monitor you've connected so far, so open all of them. You will find a folder labeled "00". Open them also and you will also find a sub-folder also named "00" (remember, for every monitor there will be this kind of folder and sub-folder)
 Search for the key labeled "Rotation" and you will notice it has it's data set to 1 which it's the default. Below you may see the data related to the corresponding screen orientation:
 1 = Landscape
 2 = Portrait
 3 = Landscape (flipped)
 4 = Portrait (flipped) 
 Auto rotation: 
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AutoRotation 
 Enable DWORD 
 0 = On
 1 = Off

 They had been on vacation for 2 weeks, they weren't pingable, and I couldn't even see their car on Netcloud or their MDT on my RMM.
 Got there and the Cradlepoint was handling out its default subnet, couldn't ping through it, and I couldn't get into the unit as it appeared to be factory reset. Had to spend an unreasonable amount of time dismounting it to find the default on the rear of it.
 Logged in and I was greeted with a subscription expiration.
 Cradlepoint will reset your device to factory defaults, and NOT PASS ANY TRAFFIC OF ANY SORT without a subscription.
 I heard this had happened a few firmware versions ago.
 But, WE WERE CURRENT and had been for years! It was a licensing issue on their side that just randomly took a license away from it, no notice of any sort, no indication on the main screen.
 Beyond unacceptable and will be replacing all of them next year. Sierra's Netcloud is a little lacking for templating, but I will absolutely not have a mission critical device stop working entirely, requiring an on-site visit to find out a fucking subscription issue for a router. I'm sure folks on Meraki are familiar with this, but I'm not doing it for infrastructure.

 So, with all this home office stuff going on, I have to find a way to let a new user log in to a computer at home. Right now I have to connect to windows using their account while in the office and connected to the company network. Not great.
 I saw that you could connect to windows using the Azure AD account but I don't understand where to start to allow this in my company.
 Do I have to migrate everything to azure AD and stop using my on-prem AD ? Can I configure it using Azure AD connect without touching my current AD infrastucture ? Like I said, I find a lot of documentation about all of this but I don't understand where to start exactly and it's driving me nuts.

 receive response emails (fail-after-delivery, out-of-office, manual replies)
 less moving parts (happy to just store emails in files)
 optional: POP/IMAP to access sent and received emails
  
No, I do not want to use an external service, I want it on-premise.

 I recently joined a school where they have a bunch of these smartboards. 
 Student have been opening up inappropriate content on the smartboards and I was looking for a way to have it locked once the teacher leaves the classroom. 
 I know they support USB key unlocking but I am also exploring other suggestions/solutions. 
 1- All staff have RFID cards for elevator access. Is it possible to use the same cards to lock/unlock the smartboards?
 2- Is there a way to have the smartboard only be functioning/unlocked as long the USB key is plugged? (Like a car’s ignition)
 3- They have Android on the devices with some of them linked to a Mini PC for extra usability/functionality (Windows)
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning, I am after so help with a little project i have been tasked to do. As always it needs to be done on the cheap. 
 We need to allow multiple end users, take a photo and upload it to only their specific user folder which they have access to. So I'm thinking a cloud based storage product where i just pay for how much storage i want rather than by user (as that is where it gets expensive, be about 150 users). That product would sync to on-prem AD. The users would log into the app with their domain user/pass and then only be able to see the one folder in the cloud storage product which they have access too where they can simply just add a photo.
 I presume this is quite a easy task but if anyone has any recommendations that would be fantastic.
 Thanks

 ​
 When I trace the path towards 8.8.8.8, I can ping each hop with +1500 MTU, (above 1472 in windows ), but at a specific hop stops it and starts dropping. Why is the packet simply not fragmented when it goes over 8.8.8.8, but it is fragmented when I ping other addressess like 1.1.1.1 . Im so confused.
 ​
 And just to add, I'm not using 'Do not fragment flag.', just normal ping with extra size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case it matters: The region is The Netherlands, Europe.
 About 5,5 years ago I started my IT career fresh out of school. I didn't know anything and learned everything on the go starting with level 1 servicedesk at a ~25-man MSP. Over the past years I managed to step up and implement/solve more complex stuff. I went from rookie to network engineer configuring routers, firewalls and switches in complex setups. On the side I also was "un-official" teamlead of support by now. Teaching the new guys the ropes - I was the go to guy for most people to come to who were at our office. It became taxing on me: The workload was high and this made the place unsociable. The mandatory on-call shifts (one full week every 6 weeks on average) were very busy too, often clocking 4-8 additional hours outside of regular times. On top of that the pay was bad too, fairly below market average for a lot of employees on the team (people talked about it which management did not like of course, berating those who discussed it).
 Upcoming Monday I am starting a new job, I am leaving the MSP world and starting as a sysadmin at a company with about 85 employees. Working 36 hours (49) for about the same pay I got when working 40 hours (58). There is one other sysadmin who has been there for about 8 years now and the focus of the company is software development for a webservice they are hosting.
 The reason I am posting this is to gather input of other people who have made the same switch, how did life change for you? Did you run into surprises, is there any advice I should hear?
 Any input/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.

 I just installed the lastest and greatest version of Eve-NG community edition, but in this release it will always force me to use the HTML5 console or i have to click the node so it can open the telnet link.
 I used to use the API to get a list over all nodes and their telnet ports from the url value in the request.
 Now only the html5 url is present.
 Do you guys know if there are any way to get a list over running nodes and their telnet ports or should i just accept to click the node from now on or use the html5 console where copy/paste does not work for me.

I have around 4 years experience in first line support but for very unique roles where I was pretty much the one and only go to IT guy who did everything so in reality I have more experience than my CV shows apart from that I have so much training in different technologies it's hard to cram in a CV.
 Now the problem I having it's that I'm trying to move from first line to second line support but recruiters keep telling me I might not have the experience to make the jump but then when I apply for any first line position they tell me I'm over qualified and they are afraid of me leaving after a short time. 
 After rejecting my application one of the interviews email the below to me as one of the reasons for my rejection: 
 "We liked your example of the achievement you are most proud of, you clearly have a solid ‘second line’ skill set, and your response at the end about what you could offer also came across well."
 Not to mention they actually said it during the interview which gave me a good hint I wasn't going to be selected.
 What can I do or say to first get through recruiters that doubt my experience and second show the company I have the skills and training for second line? 
 By the way in my are the jump in salary from first line to second line could be something from 22K to 38K.

So I did all the usual troubleshooting and internally everything was fine. External email was getting to the Barracuda ok but not being delivered to exchange. All “tests” passed and the Barracuda could send me test emails. I also discovered if I re-queued a message it would go back to deferred but if I skipped the scan engine and just flat out deliver it, the mail would show up… Must be something with email scanning so I reboot the appliance. That doesn’t fix it so I call Barracuda and open a case. The tech said he’s been doing it these calls all night. They pushed out a bad update and I locked up a scanning engine service. A reboot doesn’t clear it. I had to start up the troubleshooting remote connection so the tech could push out an update and restart the service. I couldn’t have done it myself as they lock that ability behind support.
 TLDR: If you’re having trouble with external emails getting stuck in the queue on your Barracuda after Wednesday night, then call support. They pushed a bad update.

 Has this worked out at all for you? We seem to be considering this after the uber/rockstar hacks + some other issues on our side.

There's a couple of people who have slapped together some scripts, and my manager's experience is somewhere around "has built a gaming PC". They use an MSP for managing anything that's above my manager's capacity and my job is to bring that in house.
 Honestly I'm really liking it. It's a small company of around 60 users and I've got a whole list of projects to accomplish and I've added a couple of my own ideas to the list, I think I can really tighten things up and get them running a bit more smoothly, get some disaster recovery procedures in place, etc. I'm feeling strangely confident in my ability to do what is being asked of me. That's not what I'm here for today.
 I'm only a few weeks in and this company hasn't really had an actual IT guy before, they've just had Chad the Ops Guy calling vendors. So, in order to help ease myself into a company that has a few decades of experience running but zero experience having an actual IT guy I want to do some user training of sorts. I want to do a sort of informal getting to know you and you getting to know me and what I can do with the title and theme being the title of this post.
 I have a few ideas for what sort of stuff goes in there, but I'd love to have your input. Folks who have started at small companies that haven't had IT people before them, what are the weird growing pains as companies get used to your presence? What won't the company expect about what my position brings to the table? I'm looking to bring some funny too, I figure anytime you're asking the users to change If you can make them laugh a little while you do it then it goes over better.

 Backstory: I asked an older accountant (probably 50 or 60 year old) if he knows what web browser he is using and got the above response.

 Perhaps this is specific to Australia or the scale of the businesses dealt with but my experience and the consensus of those in other businesses and organisations here seems to be physical security companies are disorganised.
 E.g. tickets, tasks, requests are lost in limbo unless called directly and repeatedly followed up if not a simple fix. Doesn't matter if throwing money at the provider still some tasks are lost.
 I've noted they often seem to not have any sort of ticketing system. 
 Often breaking systems while doing a fix for another task only to often try and charge to fix the system that was broken by them previously or not implemented correctly.
 Don't blame the workers just seems like poor management, poor direction, keeping on top of modern processes and systems etc.
 Is this universal? Specific to the size of security companies or just an Australian issue?

 On the Cat 8500, I am trying to allow all the routes from the N7K in, but allow only the Loopback 8 interface to advertise out.
 This is working for the most part, except the Loopback on the Catalyst 8500 never gets advertised to the Nexus 7K. Is something wrong with my distribute-lists?

 It is nice and has a lot of features through the portal, but still couldn't figure out how to change IP without having to restart it and interrupt the internet, if that's possible to do on that, at all.
 On the old modem portal, I could just click on disconnect and reconnect in a section in portal and the IP would change without any restart.
 Am I missing anything?

 I’m flying solo at a small, private K12 and most of our cables are running the obstacle course around air ducts, electrical conduit, fluorescent light fixtures, and a bunch of other crap, often lying on top of (and obstructing) the ceiling tiles.
 Im curious about standard methods, code requirements, and materials I could buy to make it easier/faster/better/safer (maybe raceways?). Please advise.
 Update: Evidently, they make cable trays. That’s what I was imagining: easy entry/exit, well supported, easily mounted.

It has to have no internet since it's using windows xp and it's an old pos system on 2 computers, and it would risk getting viruses. The other network is just the main computer that has connection to the internet and surveillance. Sometimes I would like to access the nas from the main computer to see how the backups are doing in the private network. Should I just connect another switch/hub from the main computer to the private network (old pos system)? Or do i need a specific type of router that aggregates/controls the ports that connects to the main computer then to the private network (old pos system)?

 The API request is pretty basic and works with curl:
 curl -X GET https://x.x.x.x/api/v1/get_stuff?token=xxxxxxx -k
 With Nornir the task looks like this:

I have tried de-prioritizing IPv6 in the registry and the netsh interface commands. I have worked with Cisco to determine we have the correct settings on the VPN. Still it doesn’t work. If I have the user run ipconfig /release, everything starts working again (for a day or two). Also, if I disable IPv6, everything works for as long as IPv6 is disabled. I have spent way too much time on this with no permanent fix other than disabling IPv6. Any thoughts on something else to try?

 We are an existing $Vendor customer and we are happy with the product and our current subscription level. We are less happy with the relentless solicitations. We are a small organization with 180 users, emailing additional users in this organization decreases your chances of expanding our business relationship. I am frustrated that users continue to receive $Vendor solicitations after I replied to you on September 12th. This frustration is compounded by the fact that I have had to ask other $Vendor representatives cease emailing any live body they find in our organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Our site needs some switching equipment, so I ordered about 40 switches last march at the distributor. Thinking I will be in time if it takes +/- 6 months.. Well. that was 6 months ago and the current forecast (with only 80% certainty) is that it will take another 6 months.
 I already have 4x 6300 running as a core, but I need 2 more to reach my 6200F's (already running +/- 15 of those).
 I cannot afford the wait 6 months again, with the probability that they won't even be delivered. We ordered them before the prince increase, but I am getting the feeling that we will never get them, but if I order again, they will delivered sooner (but with an increase of the price ofcourse).
 ​
 Anyone in the same boat or has other switches working together? Like my 6300's are stacked (as well as some other 6200F's) and I really don't want to stack other brands/types (if that even works) but I really am in a situation that I wanted to avoid at all cost.
 Any idea's?

 I am once again asking for your IT advise oh great and mighty users of the world wide web / Reddit.
 As usual I have been tasked with something that seems impossible.
 I need to run the Registry from a non admin user but I can only run it as a user with admin rights. However giving that user admin rights only for this one time would require me to restart the server twice which in this situation is a big no no due to other issues.
 I know about the Shift + Right-Click = Run as different user. However I cannot make the changes without having admin rights. But running it as Administrator / user with admin rights, will only result in those changes applying to that user account instead.
 Basically what we need to do is create Keys and Entries for User A (non admin) which requires admin rights due to it's location. But I cannot run a .reg file to add those since you cannot run it as admin or other user. Even making changes to entries is impossible since it requires admin rights to update. Most likely to prevent normal non admin users from making changes for obvious security reasons.
 Anyone got an idea?
 For information, I need to create and modify reg keys in the following location.

 We have a sizable number of machines using USB-C to connect to monitors that have built-in NICs.
 There is a problem with the default driver settings for these NICs and we need to disable a power saving feature to resolve.
 The problem is we have a number of other docks that also use Realtek NICs and we must not interfere with those NIC settings.
 Does anyone have a good script/mechanism to identify one Realtek NIC from another on the same system, in order to determine the GUID, in order to apply registry settings on just the desired NIC?

Its the only AM/AV I've ever personally paid for. I love its browser guard as well. I've taken it too some seriously dirty places and it seems to relentlessly block everything.
 I personally feel its so good, despite having Cisco Secure Endpoint(which recently I found out from Morphisec themselves Cisco uses some of their mechanisms in Secure Endpoint) and Crowdstrike, just to be safe I will install MBAM and run a final check and uninstall it. Never can be too sure xD
 I am curious what are your preferred AM/AV software and if many people feel Malwarebytes is (one of)the best and if not why it may not be. I don't like being biased, if there is a reason someone may think MBAM isn't that great I'd definitely like to know why for my own preferences and knowledge.

 Bascially while on a Teams call I will get a disconnect from zscaler which will put my call on hold, it will then reconnect and reconnect me, this can happen depending on the length of the call 1 to 2 times.
 Our IT department is now blaming my wifi for this issue, I do not think that is the issue but have taken the steps they requested which was to restart my modem/router. 
 The setup of my home which I have explained to them a couple times now is:
 1x Netgate SG-2220 1x Omada switch (8 port PoE) 1x Omada EAP225 v3 2x Omada EAP245 v3
 On a 200/10 using FQ_Codel/Taildrop (pfsense forum recommended).
 I sit about 5 feet from one of the EAP245s, it is at 18db for 5ghz and 12db for 2.4ghz and my work computer is connecting via 5ghz, all that is between them is a small inside wall (the AP is in a closet with thin doors, no glass). Measuring on my macbook air on the same desk I see -98db noise and -44db RSSI.
 I also connect the work computer to my IoT vlan which has no access to my LAN, I redirect DNS to my pfsense box and redirect NTP to my pfsense box on all of my vlans (LAN, IoT, Guest) with no issue.
 We used to use BIG-IP and had zero issues with this software.
 EDIT: My work computer is some Dell with an i7, 16gb ram and Windows 10 Enterprise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 We're curious how other IT professionals are managing ex-employees' mailboxes when they leave the company. The organization is experiencing rapid growth and we've found our current process isn't scalable. We use Microsoft 365, but our users have the desktop applications such as Outlook through VL. Currently, when an employee leaves the company either through termination or resignation, we add ourselves to the ex-employee's 365 account and perform a manual export of their mailbox to a PST. This PST gets saved and stored on our file server forever. Seems fairly simple when it's listed like that, but it's quite a tedious process from start to finish. You need to give yourself access to that person's mailbox, let it pull in their mail on Outlook which usually takes at least an hour if not more before it becomes accessible, (and you'd be surprised at how big we let employees' mailboxes get to), and then perform the export which again, depending on the mailbox size could just freeze your Outlook up for some time. Now ironically enough we recently found that it looks like you could do all of that in the Compliance center in 365, but we still want to look at our overall process and reassess. Do we really need to keep these employees' mailboxes forever? Does 30 days suffice and then we blow it away (with exceptions of course)? Converting to shared mailboxes seems to be a popular method - what does that look like long-term? Do you use a third-party cloud solution to archive mailboxes? 
 In short, we're just looking to explore how other businesses retain 365 mailboxes to determine our options. 
 Thank you in advance.

It's a domain env and we use point and print on windows 2019 server. On user's machine, In Settings > printers, when printer is installed from print server, I check printer preferences and all settings appear just like on server. But when they try to print from chrome or edge, when printing dialog pops up, I would select the printer and chose preferences, but none of the settings are there. Like stock/paper selection for example. It's like something is preventing browsers to read printer preferences. I will try again signing in as me (different domain account) and checking if issue is present but I'm pretty sure I had the user sign in on another computer and had the same issue. I will test that again. On print server though, there are no security restrictions setup.
 Any one have any idea if something in browser can affect this behavior?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you made sure your organization is ready for the deprecation of basic authentication in Exchange Online?
  
⚠️ Microsoft will begin to disable basic authentication for Exchange Online on October 1, 2022.
  
So, what will be the impacts of basic auth deprecation?
 Overall, Microsoft will disable basic authentication in Exchange Online for the following protocols:
  
Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)
 POP
 IMAP
 Remote PowerShell
 Exchange Web Services (EWS)
 Offline Address Book (OAB)
 Outlook for Windows and Mac
  
Got you screaming! Is SMTP protocol also being deprecated by Microsoft?
 No, SMTP isn't being deprecated. But if you stop using it for a while, your SMTP protocol will be disabled. Also, the SMTP will be disabled for tenants who never used the protocol previously.
 Then, what are we going to do with this deprecation?
 All we need to do is to switch to Modern authentication.
  
IMAP/POP: Now, OAuth 2.0 support for POP, IMAP, and SMTP Auth protocols have been released, so users can switch to OAuth.
 Exchange ActiveSync: If your organization still using Exchange ActiveSync, you can use Outlook Mobile clients to connect with Exchange Online.
 Do you spend more time on Remote PowerShell to access Exchange Online? Then, use Exchange Online PowerShell V2 Module which supports modern auth.
 You can begin updating your users' client applications to OAuth 2.0 versions.
 Your code must be updated to use OAuth 2.0 if you have written using protocols with Basic Authentication.
 You need to contact the developers of the 3rd party application and ask them to update it to support OAuth 2.0 or switch to an application that supports Modern authentication.

The idea of having to interact with my coworkers again, commuting, not seeing my family, not having micro-breaks etc etc is extremely disheartening. As we're all in IT, the majority of us can handle most of our job from home honestly. No reason for me to be in an office to spin up a new VM or install some new roles on my 2019 server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have finally gotten all users to where they are not local admins on their machines.
 We have also done a good job of having sysadmins utilize daily driver accounts as well as separate admin accounts in Active Directory.
 What I am struggling with is creating 1) 'sub-admin' accounts with rights to install software on local machines and 2) sub-admin accounts for performing basic tasks in AD and on the domain.
 Obviously you don't want to use your domain admin account to elevate a one-off software install on a local machine. And we have lots of those one-offs. We have many field technicians that require specialized mechanic's software. And they are very different per technician. You'll have one tech that is certified on Cummins, another Mercedes etc. There's really no way to standardize things. So they must call in for assistance with installation.
 One of my colleagues has piloted an installers security group in AD and gave that group local admin rights on all workstations. 
 Several problems with this:
 1) you now have (in our case) half a dozen or more new accounts with the power to wipe out every single workstation. 
 2) it does not solve the problem of machines not being on the corporate network bc you can't elevate with no DC available. VPN on every machine with another 2FA account and PW ?
 3) are we to create yet ANOTHER tier of admin accounts to, for example, run RSAT ADUC?
 The more I read, the more I get spooked to EVER use a domain admin account. But it's also almost like a custom account needs to be created for every single task. DNS change? use your DNS admin account. DHCP change? DHCP login. Add a subnet to sites and services? GPO change? SAS account. GPO account. WTF? Is this the state of the world now ?
 I am all ears for reasonable suggestions.

We installed the AdminByRequest where they can request admin rights for a period of about 30miinutes. Well the war has been ongoing since then with lots of complaints. Just got an e-mail that someone tried installing a Siemans app that requires more than 30 minutes to install so half way through the installation, the process stops since the AdminByRequest is only valid for 30minutes.
 ​
 i stand to be corrected, but is admin right only needed to start the installation process? or is it required for the entire period of the installation?
 Also is there a better way to handle this? since they are insisting on having their local admin rights? how do you deal with this in your organization?

 So... why not find out:
 ADHD screening questionnaire
 Autism screening questionnaire
 Don't look at them as 'horror stories' - chances are if you're gainfully employed, you're not a particularly severe case.
 However it may help you understand how your brain works, and how it's not like "Normal" people. And you can make adaptations and coping strategies. 
 I genuinely feel that both these traits can be extremely beneficial in a sysadmin, if they're harnessed effectively. Maybe you don't even need medication for it - just a better understanding of what things you do well, and why you find the hard things hard.

 I configured HTTPS Listener for WinRM with a self-signed certificate, I followed this tutorial :
 http://vcloud-lab.com/entries/powershell/powershell-remoting-over-https-using-self-signed-ssl-certificate
 It works. I can connect Powershell remotly from any device on my network, even if I don't add the self-signed certificate in the CA Trust Store thanks to options -SkipCACheck and -SkipCNCheck. I can connect with the IP address.
 But after sysprep of the server, the HTTPS listener is preserved and listens on port 5986, the self-signed cert is still in the Local Store but the remote connection doesn't work !
 ​
 I get this when I try to connect to the server (syspreped) :
 Connecting to remote server 10.X.X.X failed with the following error message : The server certificate on the destination computer (10.X.X.X:5986) has the following errors: Encountered an internal error in the SSL library 
 I can't connect with both IP address and DNS name (that matches the previous certificate)
 On the remote server, when I check winRM config, I get this message :
 Error number: -2144108267 0x80338115 Cannot create a WinRM listener on HTTPS because this machine does not have an appropriate certificate. To be used for SSL, a certificate must have a CN matching the hostname, be appropriate for Server Authentication, and not be expired, revoked, or self-signed. 
 Before the sysprep, winRM HTTPS was working. After sysprep, it doesn't work anymore.
 What happens during sysprep process ? What does change with the certificate ? Do I need to use an other process to configure winRM ?
 ​
 Thanks

 After working MSPs for a lot of my career, thankfully being able to escape a few years ago, I have known people who have burned out, stressed out, and went over the edge. I have seen people die of stress, bad health, and acute lead poisoning.
 This point was driven home again recently, by an acquaintance who I worked with about seven years ago, and who was an acquaintance on social media. He was laid off unexpectedly last week. After a day or two of family stressing out about finances and how they were going to afford the mortgage payments, with his wife really laying into him on social media on how he dared to get laid off, today, I found that his wife is now a single mother, and the fune…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes yes I know, another STP question. I was handed a new Aruba CX 6000 switch from my boss to play around with, and learn the new config. I've watched the airheads youtube series about AOS-CX which was very helpful, and I have been scrolling through the 1900 page manual, but I am not sure if I got it right. 
 I am trying to use MSTP, have my client access ports configured as admin-edge with bpdu-guard and loop-guard enabled. In my example config the first 10 ports are configured for wireless access points, the next 10 for clients, and the last 4 are for links to other switches, and to the firewall. 
 When I connect an older 2530 switch to port 1/1/24 I'm getting STP issues and the 2530 disables the port. 
 I do not have a config to compare mine to, or anyone at all to ask. Did I get this right or did I make some rookie mistakes? The VLANs are not the issue, I'm not completely new to networking, its just the MSTP that I'm struggling to understand. 
 According to what I learned I should not have to enable bpdu or loop guard on the uplinks, but only on client access ports? Does this include APs? 
 ​
 Any videos/info about MSTP in AOS-CX would be very helpful.

 I found something like AskCody - but other than that I can't find many other possibilities.
 I'm open to opensource or something reasonably priced. 
 The TV we'll be using is a digital signage TV so we could put a signage app on it or connect a NUC or RBPI that we have laying around.
 My preference goes to putting up a display (Joan or Evoko) at each meeting room - but for multiple reasons we aren't allowed to do that. :(
 So we gotta run with what we have: a TV in the meeting center. 
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We will be migrating emails for a specific domain in the coming days and I was wondering whether anyone had done this before with Mimecast. I raised a Support Request with Mimecast over a week ago and have had no response at all, which is rubbish.
 So domain.com is currently in 365 TenantA with MX pointing directly to Microsoft and we will be bringing this domain into our 365 TenantB. We use Mimecast for our email security, so this domain will be added here too. My previous plan for these types of migrations has been:
 1) Change MX of domain.com to something invalid. Emails will queue and retry at sender for an unknown period. 2) Add domain to 365 and add aliases. 3) Add domain to Mimecast and perform directory sync from 365 so Mimecast is aware of all the new aliases. 4) Change MX to Mimecast.
 This works well, with the exception of the unknown behaviour when switching to the bogus MX records.
 It got me wondering; is there a way with Mimecast that we could bring the domain in earlier, maybe even pre-migration, so that when I start the rip out of the domain from TenantA, Mimecast will queue email and then ultimately deliver when all the aliases are added to TenantB? Is that or something similar possible?
 Thanks in advance!

 More and more of our clients are starting to use server 2019 on their rds farm. Eventually they're all confronted with slow session openings.
 Firewall rules are clean, we use a script to clean them every weekend or months. PS command "get-netfirewall rule | measure" only returns about 1k rules max.
 I've read alot about the appreadiness service causing problems like this and when the service is disabled, sessions open nearly instantly. I've also read about problems with updates when the service is disabled.
 Are you guys dealing with the same issue and is there any other way to deal with it ?

On the switch I have a vlan 1 with an IP address and from the switch I can ping the management IP and the diagnostic interface IP on the FTD. So far, so good.
 From the FTD to the switch I cannot reach anything.
 I cannot ping the vlan 1 IP address on the switch, even though I do get an ARP entry in the table, and the ping returns question marks, not dots. I had configured an IP address on the diagnostic interface in order to be able to reach a local DNS server from the FTD so I can use FQDN objects in some rules.
 I have checked ten locations and five of them work as expected (ping and DNS resolution) and five of them cannot reach the local IP addresses on the switch or DNS servers. 
 This makes me feel like a noob. How can it be that I can ping from the switch to the FTD but not the other way round?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 ​
 I am trying to set up a backup NTP server for remote client PCs which have joined domain when they are disconnected from corporate network.
 ​
 I followed this blog post particularly "Enable Backup Simple-NTP Sync" part to have a backup NTP server for remote client PCs.
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/domain-time-synchronization-in-the-age-of-working-from-home/ba-p/1440820
 ​
 After adding those reg keys I captured NTP traffic with wireshark but I only see NTP traffic between client and external NTP server even the client is connected to corporate network via VPN.
 interesting thing is that when I run w32tm /query /status command, it shows the source time server as my domain controller though I did not see that traffic on wireshark.
 ​
 My understanding for these configuration is that the client will first try to sync time to domain controller and if domain controller is unreachable then will try sync time to external NTP server.
 At the moment the client PC does not even try to talk to domain controller by looking at captured packets.
 ​
 Does anyone have the same issue?

 I have been unable to save the name of some cloud-only distribution groups after editing them via the 365 EAC web UI, most I can edit and save without issue, but some return "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" when I try to save the new name.
 Turns out if you swap to the Classic Exchange Admin Center and edit the name there, saving the new name works without issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 is there a standard or best practice as to whether DHCP reservations should be set inside or outside the address pool?
 Simple example: DHCP Pool = 192.168.0.50 - 192.168.0.149/24
 The client should now get a "fixed" IP in form of a reservation. But which? 192.168.0.50 or 192.168.0.150?
 I have read different recommendations so far, from definitely inside, definitely outside to never mind.
 Sometimes I stumble over devices that don't even allow a reservation outside the pool.
 That's also why I've always defined reservations within the scope and only really fixed IPs outside of it.
 On the other hand, the pfSense Docs says:
  
ISC dhcpd only checks via ping to ensure that an IP is not actively in use when making assignments.Making a static mapping does not “reserve” that IP out of the pool.The static mapping in this case merely represents a preference for an IP and others are not prevented from taking the IP if it is not in use. 
 (...) 
 As such, it is best to only make assignments outside the range/pool, and the GUI enforces this practice.
  
So how it the right way to do it?
 Thanks and greetings,
 Martin

 In NX-OS 9.3.3 this feature does not seem to exist. I can only configure a single next hop if I use the verify-availability parameter and no sequence number available.

 Okay so, most of you are probably thinking: Pride in IT support???
 But hear me out...
 I recently started a job as a 1st line IT support employee. I was really proud of myself when I got this job, because for me, it was a way to get into IT. It also happend to pay well.
 The way I looked at my job, was like this: An entry level IT job that I can grow in and use as an foundation to hopefully grow into something else.
 I never looked at it like it's a low job (in a negative way), even tho it's on the bottom of the pyramid.
 The thing is that I sometimes get negative comments that put me down and make me lose the motivation and pride in what I do, or the grow process that I'm in.
 Some of the negative comments or actions that I experience: "Just let him do the shitty work, he's a first line employee." "You're not on our level yet, our work is way more difficult."
 Just comments that show that I'm on the lowest level of IT.
 I know it's not the most prestigious job, but is it really that bad and shameful?
 Ps: I don't hate what I do. It's a boring job, but it pays well and it's comfortable.

Basically this script leverages Netmiko and concurrent.futures modules to log into a list of Juniper devices and commit set config commands. I'm sure I could have some better error handling or verification the commit completed and the config is now how I wanted, but I'm not sure how to do that. I'm also not sure if it's better to use multiprocessing or multithreading... ProcessPool vs. ThreadPool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We will be replacing 2 Cisco nexus distribution switches which are connected to the two 7k cores (2 links from each switch to the cores, 1 link to 1 core and the other link to the other core).
 We are using vpc on our switches and rstp for spanning tree.
 Typical 3 tier Cisco architecture.
 Only has 1 svi for switch management and a bunch of vlans.
 Default gateway pointed to svi on core switch.
 Has ACLS, snmp, qos, aaa and ntp configurations as well.
 Access switches have uplinks to distribution switches using port channels.
 Distribution switches have uplinks to core using port channels.
 Will be replacing them with 9k Nexus switches which will have the same configuration as the old ones (apart from the svi which will temporarily have a different IP).
 Plan is to connect the access switches to the old distribution as well as the new distribution switches so that end devices/access switches can reach the core switches 2 ways, 1 through old distribution pair and the other through new distribution pair. Therefore all we have to do is turn off old ports on old pair during the change window and we should expect traffic to flow through new pair?
 Is this the right way?
 And we want this to be done with no downtime.
 Thank you.

 Boss goes to print something today to his desktop printer, but no workie. Printer is happy, no error messages. Check the print queue, full of pending jobs. Cancel all but the latest one, and check Control Panel.
 Printer offline.
 Double check the printer for errors and physical issues. The USB cable is a little loose on the printer end, but it seems to move in-and-out smoothly and stays put once in.
 Double check computer. No errors other than printer offline.
 Pull printer out from the wall to check the back for physical issues. Notice the empty USB port.

 Move the USB-B cable from the RJ-11 port to the USB port. Laser printer happily dims the lights and triggers the UPS, then spits out the print job, just like it's supposed to.

 Kudos to the developers. They take pride in their work and it really shows.

Either way we need to either move, delete, or rename this file but as it stands I can't find any way to interact with it. Could the db be corrupted?

At multiple different doctors offices (some run by large hospital chains) I see more computers just left unlocked with lots of personal information on them and unattended. In hospitals the same problem exists and the only type of security seems to be “well it auto locks after 10, 15, or more minutes” even at one hospital where you have to scan a badge to unlock the computer on the screen it has a countdown timer to auto lock after 20 minutes. 
 At a recent ER trip they left the room every time without logging out and the dashboard up basically told me about everybody’s current issues, name, DOB, etc. including myself
 I understand that IT and sys admins only have so much power in the medical world and doctors will complain if a computer locks but there has to be a happy medium?
 I understand that critical medical equipment can not go to sleep or lock but the end user machines entering data should have better policies

 Since OneDrive gpoeditor provides only to backup desktop/pictures/documents. I was wondering if there is an GPO available from Firefox or Chrome in the admx files where i can store the bookmarks for example on documents, or desktop etc.
 ​
 I downloaded https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwindows
 i downloaded https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases

 and did the following: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xpc45u/comment/iq3auit/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 
 So it works, when i want to add the admx and adml files, now i see it.

 Curious to hear tips from anyone that has been thru a similar scenario.

I am able to apply it to individual interfaces though. InfoSec would like to block individual mac addresses from our enterprise network and we have used MAC ACLs successfully in the past, but recently we replaced one of our Nexus 7K PE routers with a Catalyst 9K and I have been hesitant to apply the mac access-group to individual interfaces when they are bundled in an etherchannel. This guide only seems to reference applying mac access-groups to layer 2 interfaces : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9600/software/release/17-1/configuration_guide/sec/b_171_sec_9600_cg/configuring_ipv4_acls.html#task_wzn_zbk_ldb
 Does anyone know if applying the mac access-group to individual interfaces will break or harm the etherchannel?
 When I attempt to apply the mac access-group to an etherchannel I get the following error :

 The server was shutdown at the time and came back online just fine. The data volume is operating fine and nothing seems out of place from a user experience perspective. That's the good news, nothing bad has happened yet..
 However, what are my options now? The OS does not see the newly allocated disk space if relevant.
 The main VHDX is 13.5 TB (this is the one I expanded), the AVHDX is 419 GB, and there is 829 GB free on the drive that contains them both so there should be enough space to merge them.
 My primary concern is merging them with now mismatching disk sizes between the VHDX and AVHDX. Can I shrink my expansion back down to the previous size and then delete the checkpoint to complete the merge?
 We do have VEEAM backups both onsite and in the cloud, but obviously 13.5 TB is a doozy even over the LAN.
 The checkpoint is from 9/20, the expansion was on 9/24, and the time of this posting is 9/27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we are going through a network upgrade which includes all new devices, new ISP circuit, new servers, new fiber, etc. One thing that is new and we haven't dealt with before is implementing SPLUNK. SPLUNK will be used to log everything from clients, servers, network devices, and whatever else. It is currently setup and running, but not currently collecting anything from out network devices. 
 For our syslog, we currently use Solar Winds Kiwi Syslog and that collects the data from all of our devices. My understanding with SPLUNK is that we set up a forwarder and the forwarder takes all the logs the Kiwi collects and forwards them to SPLUNK.
 Our department director is tired or waiting on the contractors to figure things out, so we he wants us to start configuring SPLUNK. He stated that he thinks SPLUNK has modules or packages you can setup that are made for Cisco devices which should make it easy to setup.
 What is the best way to go about setting this up? Is using a forwarder the right way to go about doing this? And if that's the case, do I still need to setup some type of module on SPLUNK for cisco devices? Or do I just forward the logs and analyze them that way? I was told to figure out what devices I need data collected from, but we already have kiwi collecting logs from all devices, so was thinking that those logs could just be forwarded as a whole. I didn't think I would have to install modules for each device that I want to collect date from. 
 I have zero experience with splunk, so just looking to get pointed in the right direction.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy,
 I'm helping a small business who is redesigning their network from scratch. I'm looking for some recommendations on how to segment the network and also recommendations on securing the Guest network.
 We are going with Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment. When everything is all said and done we will have:
  
UDM/router
 POE Switch
 4 WAPs
 6 (or so) outside security cameras
 1 badge reader for door access
 1 video doorbell
 6 smart TVs
 I think that's it but will update if I think of anything else
  
The couple computers that are used only need internet access. There will not be a file server or the need to share files. All that is done through OneDrive/Teams which just needs internet.
 ​
 What recommendations would anyone have for different networks to have? I was envisioning possibly 3 networks:
  
Main Network
 Guest Network
 IOT Network (not sure if we need this one)
  
The Main Network would be for all the stuff in the list about except the TVs.
 The Guest Network could be for the handful of computers they have. These could also go on the Main Network but I don't think there's any real need for that. Could go either way on this one. Smart devices could go here.
 The IOT Network could be for the TVs and any other "smart" devices that might get added down the road. Again, not sure if this is actually needed as these could just go on the Guest Network.
 ​
 The other question is, How would you recommend we secure the Guest Network?
  
Wide Open - Company Computers would then go on the Main Network
 WPA Key - Post a key on a sign, people can connect to it just like any other network. Smart devices could go on this network
 Wide Open w/ Terms & Condition - Need to click "I Agree" like at a hotel - This is annoying at times and some equipment doesn't handle that sort of interface very well. Smart devices would probably need an IOT network then.
  
​
 Thanks for any input and ideas.

They were using ULM which integrates to their AD. It appears that ULM is no longer supported and Canon told the client they will need to use Uniflow Online Express which I believe is the free tier of Uniflow. 
 I'm really struggling to find anything on the Canon site about the technical details, it's mostly just sales stuff. From my understanding so far it won't link with AD, that would be the paid for uniflow version which would also need the paid for Universal Print by Microsoft (which uses Azure AD rather then AD). 
 I think the bit I'm hazy on is how it all connects. Does the Uniflow driver connect to something in the cloud that connects to the printer?
 Going forwards it's not essential that it integrates with AD, it's a small school with 60 - 70 staff, so I could set them individually and add it to the new user process, but I curious as to peoples experiances.

 We're using a third-party tool to attach our internal and external mail signatures. The tool also attaches the signature to the mail within the senders' outbox, but it uses the signature of the last email sent.
 That's our Problem. For legal reasons, we need to always attach the external signature within the senders' outbox.
 As the tool doesn't provide this feature, it would be helpful to delay the mail to the external recipient for a few seconds, so the signature would be our external signature.

 Is this possible with exchange online, or is there a better solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the "recent" rulings from more and more data protection authorities regarding the legality of using Google analytics as a European company - it has finally become a priority for us to get a proper overview. 
 Our "known" offenders have been working on this for a while preparing pseudonymization or moving away from GA, but as we have 400+ domains each with the option of subdomains I'm sure we have more around which have come in over the years from M&As or simply rogue employees. 
 As we have a pretty good overview of the domains I'm looking for a simple way to scan a list of hostnames and produce a GA "Yes/no" result. 
 I considered just doing an invoke-webrequest and checking for references to GA .js files such as 
  
Google Analytics (ga.js)
 Google Analytics Remarketing (dc.js)
 Google Universal Analytics (analytics.js)
 Google Analytics Global Site Tag (gtag.js)
 Google Analytics Experiments (ga_exp.js)
 Google Tag Manager (gtm.js)
 Google AdWords Conversion (conversion.js)
 Google AdWords Phone Conversion (loader.js)
 Google AdWords Remarketing (conversion.js)
 Google AdWords Dynamic Remarketing (conversion.js)
  
I'm not really sure if that would produce valid results 
 surely someone else has already come across this, or produced a script which my google-fu is just not able to dig out 
 I've looked at sites such as builtwith.com or gachecker.com - but can't run through 1000s of hostnames by hand

I would like to know if there is a way to allow only the web server to send on behalf of these users. Eg. mailbox [webserver@domain.com](mailto:webserver@domain.com) sends and email to client coming from [user1@domain.com](mailto:user1@domain.com). I would like that [webserver@domain.com](mailto:webserver@domain.com) can only send on behalf of [user1@domain.com](mailto:user1@domain.com) from IP 1.1.1.1. 
 Microsoft support guy says its not possible but im sure someone here knows of a way.

 Over the last few days we are starting to see users having issues with onedrive for business.
 The Onedrive client will either hang at "processing changes..." of "We are trying to sign you in" 
 We also see that the client removes synced folders from explorer, and when we try to sync them it prompts a message saying "We found this folder, would you like to use this" 
 More and more users are having general issues with Onedrive, are you guys seeing something similar?

 New to the Chrome Enterprise world and still trying to understand how the admin console and management process works there. 
 It seems like I can apply settings only to organizational units. That has raised 3 questions:
  
Is that accurate? That's the only segmentation I have? 
 Can I apply a setting to a specific user or a machine? 
 What happens if I apply two conflicting settings to two different organizational units, and one user from OU1 logins to a browser used previously by a user from OU2?

 We were currently evaluating some email security solutions.
 We evaluated Proofpoint Security Essentials and Anubis Networks.
 Both are very good, however, meanwhile we also acquired Office 365 E5 licenses for all users, and thus, we were able to test Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
 So I'm asking your opinion, if I should spend money on Proofpoint (therefore having 2 products Proofpoint SE + Defender) or if Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will be enough to stop those pesky emails (spam, phishing, malware).
 Thank you for your opinions.

 While doing so migrating for the datacenters i had no issues at all , but while migrating for the braches i faced a little issue with the Vlan creation on the Cisco Vmanage.
 as i do usally i first check the router configuration that is currently deployed on the site and then create template on the cisco vmanage for the sd-wan router thats going to replace it, while all the brached on the customer side are router on stick which means all the vlans are created on the router it self and there is no core switch or any kind of L3 switch on the braches.
 The only issue that i am facing is that the customer has total of 94 different vlans on each branch , so the questions is do i create 94 different vlan template and push it ? , which i already did and was stuck at about 30 and i cannot put any more on VPN 1 (service side vpn) , or is this another way or solution that i am not awre about ? 
 appreciate any help or advice

 Cue digging around in the calendar permissions and delegates to see how this could have happened but no where did User A have any such permission.
 Eventually we found that they were in a group that had been given full access to User B's mailbox, however previously this has never been an issue and the permissions have been in place for quite some time. As a test, we removed the group from Full Access and half an hour later, User A couldn't see private items anymore.
 I can't find anything online (feel free to perform better Google-fu) that suggests that MS have made this change and our mailboxes were migrated to EO a few years ago and there haven't been any recent changes that we've made. Has anyone else encountered this recently?

 My client has MailStore installed on-premise and the add-in activated for his outlook installation. When opening Outlook, with the add-in, a cert warning pops up, asking, if I trust this website/ connection. When I look at the cert, I see "TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT" as the issuer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I’ve recently got a new job at a company to migrate from their current MSP to lead the in house IT department, and eventually phase them out.
 We have been back and forth with them and they have let us know that they can’t provide any access to anything before signing an indemnity clause (which is fair enough).
 We are sorting out the new agreement where they are asking which services to drop for now and to change to a block hour rate service instead.
 They run RMM software as usual, and are asking if we want to adopt it with a fee. Are there any better solutions for a small business instead of RMM? Monitoring/Management more tailored for in-house IT?
 Any other advice from people who have maybe dealt with this situation before will be appreciated as well.
 Apologies if not enough detail, first time posting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is now a good time for job change given the fact that we are heading into a recession. 
 I have been working as a system administrator for the last 12 yrs.(mostly onprem infra and Azure for AD). I have recently passed AWS SAA C02, CKA. I have gone thru some courses on Ansible, jenkins, Terraform, Python to understand all the moving pieces in the world of DevOps. I have done some small projects at my home lab to get an understanding of these technologies. 
 I have started looking at the job market this month and started noticing very few postings. (I am based in Canada, looking for opportunities in US and Canada). 
 I spoke to few of my friends and colleagues who are in the industry and i have got mixed opinions. Some say, DevOps job roles won't be affected even if we end up in a recession. Some say, just stick to my current job (stable job) until the dust settles. 
 I m really confused of what to do. Should i wait until early next year or should I continue with my job search. 
 Please advise.

 If my question is surprisingly simple for you, it is because my background is not in telecommunication. I'm a machine learning engineer. But for a project, I need to understand the environment very well.
 I'm learning about the handover and resource allocation in telecommunication. The handover is not the main part actually. But because transferring devices get triggered by devices' measurement reports, I need to understand it in the context of 5G.
 The problem is 3GPP standards and ETSI are generic and don't talk about what happens in devices exactly. Online websites that talk about it contradict each other.
 So I'm wondering if someone can point me to a document that explains exactly what happens in a mobile device before sending those measurement reports.
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I manage a 40G ring network with around 10 locations. Each location has around 20 routes. Each site is using a Juniper EX4300 pair connected to an OSPF ring. Our DC sits on the ring and aggregates all routes with a pair of EX4600s. Our firewall then does peering and WAN. 
 We are in the process of migrating from a ring topology to a star topology in a new colocation space. I am looking for advice on hardware. Each location will be connected to the DC w/ 2 x 10G fiber strands and 1G WISP backup. 
 I am thinking of dropping 2 x MX150s at each location, and then using an ACX 7024 pair at the DC, but is this overkill? Should I just upgrade to a better L3 switch setup? Looking for recommendations. I love Juniper but am open to other options. I am pretty familiar w/ Cisco IOS and other similar platforms. We are somewhat budget oriented, but I am trying to stay away from Mikrotik. (We are required to have support contracts)
 I have never working with the MX or ACX series before. I was considering the MX204, but with the EoL announcement, it is out of the question. We are looking to purchase hardware early next year, and it will probably be another year after that until the project is complete. Thank you

 On the web the commonly suggested method seems to be to add the share in Login Items.
 This works initially but as it just fires at login and doesn't keep alive through disruptions, the user will have to reconnect manually through Finder again should the connection drop.
 Were I on Linux I would just use fstab, but I'm seeing some conflicting information on this for MacOS and Samba network shares.
 It varies from using similar files in the form of "/etc/auto_master", "/etc/auto_smb", "synthetic.conf", and then of course "/etc/fstab" itself (which itself has further different suggestions to use "cifs" in the filesystem type column, or "-fstype=smbfs" in the options column).
 What is the best, and most "correct" approach as of Monterrey, which will ensure if the connection drops, the mount will work again upon reconnection?
  
Hacky (albeit working) solution.

Because it will be new construction we'll have more options in terms of cable runs and infrastructure. As we are a nonprofit, cost is always a concern and has to be balanced with performance. We currently use mostly Ubiquiti gear for better or for worse and have 500mb fiber coming in with internal fiber to most developed "areas" of our 1000 acre campus.
 My initial thought was running fiber from one of our main hubs to the central bath house, where a fiber switch would feed fiber directly to each of the cabins. In the cabins' attic would be a media converter and access point. I'm thinking I'd like to get some ethernet drops run into convenient places and have the ability to upgrade to a fiber switch if more connections become a need late on.
 Thoughts or suggestions?

 I've been working almost exclusively with Cisco wireless over last few years (some Meraki thrown in for good measure). This includes ekahau surveys, deployment, troubleshooting a range of AirOS and the new Catalyst WLCs, across hundreds of deployments at this stage. 
 I have an upcoming opportunity to start working with Aruba wireless side of things (due to costs, lead times in some areas, general boredom, proof of concept), which I have not touched in years. Generally I would say a wireless protocol is a wireless protocol, regardless of vendor - However, based on your experiences, is there any glaring differences or "gotchas" when it comes to switching from deploying cisco 5508/5520/9800s to the Aruba equivalents? I would love to hear some personal experiences from others making a similar switch, and how that went.

 This morning I go into the server room to get a serial number off a device, and I notice a puddle of water on the floor.

It's pretty annoying, and I often need to get in there and refute something, or point out how it doesn't apply to our situation.
 I'm talking about people tagging IT and saying that we need to turn off windows updates ASAP, with a link to an article titled "Microsoft confirms it's intentionally bricking 3rd party laptops" (I'm paraphrasing the title) . The actual article is wildly misleading, and appears to be a reference to a problem with a windows update that happened several years ago.
 Also got a "Looks like we can stop using MFA?" comment in reference to an article with a title like "MFA does nothing!". This one was native marketing for a privacy VPN product. The argument was basically that MFA doesn't stop your employer from monitoring your web traffic, technically correct, but misses the whole point of MFA.
 Do you guys have a ready response when people post stuff like this? If it's a security vulnerability thing, I see if there is a CVE reference, if it's an MS thing, a KB. with those it's possible to actually check if this is a real thing we have to care about, but it basically never is.

And specifically, are there any use cases you can share?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All, 
 I'm looking for some clever ideas for some kind of "Thank You" gift for people inside my company who are NOT IT personnel but they go above and beyond to help out with our IT department. These people are typically in our remote offices where we have no IT support and do some of the standard "move patch cable from #x to #xx," "connect computer to internet so I can remote in," "reboot kiosk computer when frozen," etc.
 I've always thought it'd be cool to have a common gift that they can proudly display on their desk or bookshelf that shows my appreciate for them beyond the constant "Thanks YOUs" I send them via phone, email, Teams, etc. 
 Do any of you have any ideas for this type of gift? I was thinking something simple like a coffee mug or desk ornament or something along those lines. It doesn't have to be 'dirt cheap,' but I'd like to be able to afford quite a few of them and send them out then someone goes above and beyond to help out.

 Sorry if this question has been asked before but I simply can't find a clear answer anywhere.
 I work for a small firm as a developer, but since I'm the only IT'er I'm also the one who manages their office 365, even though I'm far from an expert.
 Currently I've been aware for a while now that basic authentication will be disabled and I've taken precautions so that external applications won't use this method any more.
 Just to be sure, I've enforced MFA for all the key users (but not everyone because they don't want the hassle)
 But now I'm seeing the following message in Azure:
 "Starting Sept. 30th, 2022 Combined registration experiences for MFA and SSPR will be enabled for all tenants"
 I checked and currently SSPR is disabled.
 I've been looking around and can't find a clear answer on what exactly will happen after sept. 30 for the end user.
 Will everyone have to run through the process of MFA and SSPR after oct. 1??
 In the sense that they will be logged out, and have to set up an additional authentication method?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am in the process of configuring Cisco Umbrella DNS filtering and I noticed that, whilst it wasn't working particularly well on Chrome (only blocking the first request and allowing subsequent requests straight through), it was working perfectly on Firefox.
 After doing some digging, it appears that when Chrome detects the DNS servers in use support DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), it will automatically, unless specified by an admin policy, switch to using Secure DNS.
 With Secure DNS being served over HTTPS, this traffic no longer arrives at Umbrella on port 53 and appears to bypass DNS inspection completely.
 I have a case open with Cisco Umbrella on this one, but has anyone else come across this? Surely they haven't enabled DoH on their DNS servers and created a bypass for their own product?
 Edit: disabling Secure DNS via Group Policy for corporate users is definitely a possibility. I will have them routing via the (Secure Web Gateway) SWG so it would likely get caught there. I have intention of securing Guest WiFi users of which I have no control over their devices/browsers. This is my main concern.
 Thanks in advance

 However 6 weeks ago the VPS I use switched IP addresses, and suddenly Google started outright blocking my emails with the following message: 
 Our system has detected that 550-5.7.1 this message is likely suspicious due to the very low reputation of 550-5.7.1 the sending domain. To best protect our users from spam, the message 550-5.7.1 has been blocked. Please visit 550 5.7.1 https://support.google.com/mail/answer/188131 for more information. 
 I have checked all my mail logs, and there is no evidence of the domain being abused, and personally I do not send out any spam. I have since tried to fill out the Google from to have the domain unbanned twice, with no apparent results.
 My domain or IP is not listed on any blacklists, so I'm completely out of ideas...
 Google Postmaster reports both the domain and IP as having a "bad" reputation 2 days before I obtained the new IP address, so maybe the IP belonged to a spammer before?
 Does anyone know what I could try next?

 Just looking for some advice,
 I’ve noriced a lot of my servers are reporting group policy errors under the system log stating ‘The processing of group policy failed internal system error’ and to check the operational log. I’ve checked this log and can’t see any errors? 
 I’ve filtered the event ID 1125 on one particular server and it’s very random. One day it happened 4 times, another day twice and some days not at all. I’m really stumped, nothing appears broken on the GPO front, the furthest the error ID 1125 goes back is Jan 2022. Looking back through them again it’s very random when the error is logged. 
 Just curious if anyone else has these event IDs regularly in their environment 
 Thank you

 ip access-list extended "BYOD" 10 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 67 20 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 68 30 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 53 exit 
 From the examples I have seen online, I don't have to add the gateway address or anything? Or should I be naming specific address ranges that the client shouldn't be able to access and then setting a permit ip any any underneath 30 permit udp....
 Thanks for any guidance you can give.

 When HTTP/2 is used, even if the backend (server-side) is h2c, it is impossible to centralize the certificate.
 Does HTTP/2 discard the advantage of certificate workday management? Should I just manage the certificate with CI/CD?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in the past few years I have been constantly dealing with super bad quality video courses of software companies in order to get their "tEcHnIcAl CeRtiFiCaTion".
 Most of them were some sort of backup service, antimalware crap, pentesting stuff like acunetix, you get the idea.
 The other day for example, I had to do a certificate for an anti malware client like kasperski or norton and the company left in multiple retakes of lines he had to do.
 He either had to cough or didn't get the pronunciation right and went: "aw damn, gotta do the line again - OK! - bla bla" and went on with the rest of the script.
 I just don't get why you would make them so unprofessionally.
 Now I do get that people can be overworked and struggle to get the video out in time, because this might not even be their actual job.
 The company probably had to get the video out in time, but come on man, this is just such a pain to watch and retrieve information from.
 Also what's up with non native english speakers putting out english tutorials in shitty english?
 We're talking about companies that make literally dozens of millions of buckeroos per year in profit.
 It's just so damn of putting. 
 Some sentences sound like questions, but are not questions
 Some sentences are grammatically incorrect
 Some sentences are being mumbled
 Some words are used in the wrong way 
 And don't get me started on flashy graphics in the video that don't have to do anything with the product itself and the cheesy, soft gitarre music in the background.
 Do you get what I mean? 
 I'm probably just fed up with having to do these wannabe technical certifications, so that our company get's better pricing for said product, but damn... 
 I think I need to look for another job.

 On first thought easy solution to update XML would be to just remove old CIM instance and then create new but there's downside - if there's any reason new one won't be created (some mistake in config or any other reason) - the connection to this remote device might be lost and we'll need to intervene with manual connection to affected workstation or laptop and do the manual troubleshooting, running scripts etc.

I have been in the same job for 10 years now earning minimum wage, struggling every month to get by and i cant even tell you why i have done that, i have hated every single day but ive just stuck with it because its the easy option i suppose. 
 To top it off my girlfriend is now pregnant and its hit me, I really need to step up now and get my arse in gear.
 I would love advice on what is the best area to get into, and what i need to learn. I am UK based in Manchester so i would want to obviously work in this area. I truly believe i could pick up anything pretty quickly, I am hungry guys, something has clicked in my head finally.

 The problem is just that i cant use up many IP’s on the range and need a single entry point to a separate lab lan of sorts. 
 Thoughts that have crossed my mind is using Traefik or pfsense and port forwarding but im not sure this is the easier way of doing things. Any suggestions on how to solve it?

 This problem occurs when connecting from the RDWeb site.
 If I do a direct connection from the RD Client it is working. 
 All my clients are on remote networks connected by VPN so the RDS severs and the clients are on different subnets. 
 DNS lookups is OK, for example I can ping all addresses both by server name and fqdn.
 Also tested to open all ports in the vpn tunnel but the same problem occurs. 
 The strange thing is that not all clients or remote offices have this problem and they are setup identically so I can’t find what is causing this. 
 Any ideas?

 I was tasked to migrate 10 legacy asa clusters (versions 7.x-8.x, ASA-50XX) to other vendor while never worked with cisco. No ASDM available.
 As I am understanding it slowly in general, vpns were always something I had least exposure to. Could anyone suggest how to effectively confirm if VPNs are still used on those?
 Currently Im evaluating if vpns are to be migrated or no. Some have vpn configs, others don't..So on those where I see it:
 As I understand, seeing live tunnel is best direct evidence of it being used (show vpn-sessiondb)
 In case I do not see it at time of it being established - are there some stats in cli available that would tell me if it was used say last month and how many times? If no stats tied to dates, anything that could help is appreciated.

 Password does not expire
 No complexity
 Also regular matching with hashes of haveibeenpwned
  
What is my goal? Users should set a secure passphrase once instead of insecure iterations of the same password over and over (password!01, password!02, and so on). The password should only be changed in case of a suspected breach.
 What do you think? I am actually quite convinced not to let passwords expire at all. But in many publications you can still read that they should rotate every 42 days. :|

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And how did you avoid getting blamed for any issues because the lazy colleague doesn't do anything?
 My current issue is, that I am supposed to transition support for an application to a colleague. The colleague has been involved with app support for the past two years. He has made zero contributions to any scripts, processes or improvements. A few months ago I figured out he hasn't logged into the app in several months. Now that I am transitioning support to him, he only does support when specifically asked. No insightful questions, or how does XYZ work, or request for meetings to show feature ABC. I am the one who has to chase him to show him how to do things.
 During a critical issue where I was on the call with the vendor, the colleague seemed "Away" in Teams. I told my manager (tactfully) that I need to show my colleague how the issue was resolved, but he is away. Manager just said, "Yes, continue to work with him and let him do the work".
 I have a feeling this will come back to me some how. I was thinking of keeping a record of all meetings, how-to sessions, meeting invites etc. Later on, if this does come back to me, I will just my manager what was done to transition support.

For the last 2 weeks they have experienced issues with their desk phones dropping calls and losing the ability to dial out intermittently throughout the day. No changes were made on this network before these occurrences. 
 We first called the phone vendor and asked them to troubleshoot, they told us that the phones run over the internet so as long as we can confirm internet is stable then the phones should work. They also recommended we call ATT and have them disable their SIP-ALG settings for our circuit. 
 Called ATT and had them disable SIP-ALG, but the problems continued. 
 I should also note that I have sat a full day at this clients office and monitored multiple ping tests to different internal and external devices and never noticed any drops, even when the phones would disconnect.
 This network has only a WatchGuard firewall and a netgear PoE switch in front of the phones, I've replaced both of these devices in hopes that one of them were faulty. Issue still persisted and phones continue to drop.
 Client is pissed, vendors pointing fingers, any suggestions appreciated.

 Thanks for reading! I've been lurking and laughing along with you all for a few months now. I'm hoping you can give me some advice.
 In the past few years I transitioned from a chef, to an operations manager and sys admin of a commodity trading group. They had some unsecure and inefficient practices, like all users logging into a single email account. I'm sure you can all imagine some of the other things they came up with.
 Once hired I purchased a domain, and implemented messaging software. This business receives an enormous amount of email and I really enjoyed creating systems that helped them be more aware of what was happening.
 I don't anticipate leaving but I am planning on taking courses to help me stay in the field when I need to leave this company.
 Can anyone recommend meaningful courses I can take outside of a degree that could help further my career as a sys admin?
 ​
 Thank you!!!

I've been asked to set up a network at this medium-sized church and I'm not quite sure what the best option is. The ISP installed a fiber connection to replace the preexisting DSL. They installed a Cisco 4300 series router and gave us a static IP to use. Because the router belongs to them I can't configure it in any way. It doesn't have DHCP set up so I have to manually set everything up. The church already had a cisco SG350-28P 28-Port Gigabit PoE Managed Switch that they had connected directly to the Cisco router.
 ​
  
I need to know if it is possible to use the managed switch for routing or if will i need to install another router. 
 If I were to use the switch for routing what would that look like and would it pose security risks?

Today our old DC's running dual ISP and using ASR1001-X with mem upgraded to 16G with full inet routes. So for each ISP we had an ASR and then peer the two ASR's. From there we had 3850X (Stack) setup as core with EIGRP taking the default route only. Idea was just get the traffic to one of the ASR's and BGP best path would kick in. Again for the most part it worked pretty well.
 But with us stepping it up to four ISP's the old design is just not going to work, we've seem to be maxing out the ASR1001-X with two full tables (which is maxed out at 16G) so this isn't going to work.
 So looking for a Edge router that can handle two to four full inet tables. For the core thinking we can just do what we did before as these 3850X should have zero issues with 4G maxed across all four ISP's or even 40G if all upgraded to 10G each.
 Or is there something else out we should be looking at for the core switches as well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to post a question without getting into the entire topology of my network environment to get people's opinions and experiences of what you all have done. We have a network change/design opportunity and I am wanting to eliminate some route redistribution between OSPF and BGP. We use BGP for WAN routers to some of our sites around the state. We have remote connectivity from all around our state via our private fiber network, DMVPN tunnels (iWAN), and various peerings with Telco providers. We do this via 2 different data centers where we peer with different Telco routers via BGP, Cisco's iWAN, and our statewide aggregation routers that connect to our private fiber network across the state. The fiber network continues to grow as we lay more and more down each year. We bring those BGP routes into OSPF via route maps that have prefix lists attached to them. I wanted to go more into BGP and stop the route redistribution wherever I can. 
 I am wondering if I should use BGP community values or route tags to allow our sites all around the state to determine what the best path to take would be. Basically every one of our remote locations have several methods of communication back to the data centers. I would like to make one path look better, and fail over, or be able to easily switch paths by changing a route map somewhere centrally to our data center. So if I change a value of a community string or route tag, all the sites switch paths at the same time, should I decide that needs to happen. Am I going down the right path here? Are route tags the best way to do this, or are community values the standard way to do this?

It all came to a head last week and I walked out for a long weekend breather. Quieting my mind I think I have determined I simply cannot be everyone, be an individual contributor, and manage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, So basically I am a developer (front end web and backend) but for years I always messed around with web hosting. Setting up servers, etc. I’ve always been SUPER into hardware (passion).
 But lately I’ve been setting up our new hosting servers for the company im at because they trusted me enough to move from managed hosting environment to rented servers where we manage the hosting ourselves.
 Most hosting clients are past clients where we made their sites. We host a few hundred but obviously want to increase.
 Im looking into collocation, but honestly I’m super surprised at the cost of servers. We are in South Africa so there aren’t many big DC providers. So only when we get a few servers would we look at collocation, but how “worth it” is hardware like Xeon CPU’s? I see there are now some new Intel consumer level CPUs that support ECC, and most new AMD CPUs support ECC. So for largely Wordpress and NodeJS environments is there an issue with going with AMD? Is there something I’m missing?
 Honestly I’m just not sure where to start with hardware, I’ve learnt what I can in theory, but real world reasons for certain choices, and advice is very different. 
 This post was a bit of a ramble but I guess I’m just looking for any good nuggets from you pros 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a network that has Server 2016 running DHCP, Sophos UTM 9 firewall, 3 Cisco CBS250 switches and Unifi access points. They are running out of IP addresses at this location, and I was wanting to create a new SSID and put it on a different IP range so that users can connect devices to that network and work with their mobile devices and laptops.
 I have setup a VLAN for that the SSID in Unifi and created a new Scope in the DHCP server. I also set the firewall DHCP relay to point to the DHCP server so anything looking for those requests can find that IP range. 
 I have setup something like this a few times in other devices using Unifi but in this current setup I am unfamiliar with Cisco and Sophos. I have figured a lot out by Googling and watching videos but I can’t seem to find this exact scenario that I am trying to recreate. 
 I am wondering if I can just setup the DHCP scope, set the network inside of Unifi with the new IP range and point the DHCP relay to the firewall without using VLAN or if I need to use VLAN how I can get it to function properly across the network.
 Do I have to create a VLAN in the Sophos for this or do I just need to tag the firewall and point the DHCP relay back to the server? Also the switches are Layer 3 which I honestly have never used personally. I have been reading up about them but still unclear how I can utilize the layer 3 in this situation. 
 I hope my post doesn’t get locked this time for being low quality. I hardly ever ask anyone for help when trying to do stuff and figure it out on my own but this one has me over thinking everything.

 Just want to clarify, I'm not using any HP drives on my system currently, just random ones I found, though those were listed on that website. This is for a home lab, nothing too serious or mission critical.

They already had a setup like this running with WD Blue HDDs but it's almost 10 years old and ready to update. The admin there read he needs "enterprise drives" and I'm like no you don't. They are more than three times the cost of the SSDs in the drive and for this setup way overkill. 
 15-20 years ago when hard drives weren't nearly as reliable I'd more inclined to agree but now not so much. Especially when the place I work at has well over a million SSDs and HDDs in their DCs around the world and all of them are your standard off-the-shelf Western Digitals or Seagates and it's running fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am designing a hypothetical network for a homework assignment. It is fairly simple thus far, but this question I have is proving more difficult to answer than I expected. I have watched networking educational videos, I've looked for sources, but it seems that my firewall implementation idea is somehow novel, though I am certain it is not. Or, perhaps it is such a dumb idea that it does not exist online. 
 I want to segment my network. Simple enough. My idea was to use firewalls at the edge of each network segment ("star" topology central router leads to firewalls at each outgoing port for the various departments) for high security. 
 Is this... Reasonable? I only seem to find network segmenting that simply uses switches, but with no firewall other than that which leads to the WAN or DMZ. Additionally, how would these firewalls generally be configured? I would imagine I could allow only the ports that are reasonable for that segment's network usage?
 Also, can I use application proxy gateways at the edge of network segments? Online sources imply that proxies should only be used at the outside edge of the LAN. I want one proxy for one department, but a different proxy for another. Each then accessing the central router of the star topology. 
 TL;DR can firewalls be reasonably used as a security measure for multiple internal network segments? What might that look like for security purposes? Same question for application proxy gateways?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we have two buildings, eight units in each building, and we are looking at doing a bulk internet deal for them.
 We are deciding between a line of sight (microwave?) Service with asynchronous up/down speeds vs dedicated modems to each unit via cable provider.
 Both offers are priced similarly and have 5 year contract terms. (4-5% yearly increase in price) The microwave provider is everywhere wireless. They would deploy redundant equipment, backup power supplies, and service equipment. We own it after 7 years. Speeds are 500Mbps or 1 Gbps, but not higher at the moment.
 My question.. I'm not sure how to evaluate the microwave offering and if it will be superior to the cable modem in each unit. Latency/jitter, etc. What should we consider? I can ask one of their other recent deployments to test their system.
 From a risk perspective, the DOCSIS4 rollout will possibly drive down prices of cable offerings (at least introductory prices), and we'll be paying more in three years than we negotiate today.

 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI.
 I'd prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped.
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

 I may choose a Dell Mobile Workstation for work. Does anyone have any experience?
 There are two for me to choose from:
 Dell Precision 3570
 Dell Precision 3571
 According to the following ranking, the 3570's processor is ranked 47th and the 3571's is ranked 1st, but the 3570 has 16GB more RAM (for a total of 32GB). 
 I use the Dell 27" S2721DGFA monitor twice. The 3571's graphics card is slightly better than the 3570's according to the following ranking.
 No special programs are used. Office, browser, a few VPN clients, anti-virus software, vulnerability scans. I work a lot in the browser. Important for me is a good performance. That's it. 
 My questions:
 Which one is better for very fast and reliable "office" work?
 What are the differences between the two?
 Or is it worthwhile to put one together yourself? That would look like this. However, I can't find anything about the integrated Intel graphics card GT2 and I don't know if it can handle two 27" monitors.
 I am very much looking forward to your feedback and thank you in advance. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, apologies if this is not the way to submit here. In our environment (mostly server 2012 r2 and 2016) we have a server that is used by a third party company to run reports. For this they require local admin access. About 6 weeks ago, three of these accounts stopped being able to launch most apps, all except for windows accessories and office 365 apps (fat)
 These users are members of the local admins group, they are also part of an ad group that is also in local admins. Launching any other application gives the error ‘this operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer’
 These accounts are only a problem with this server, it’s the only one they would normally access
 I’ve cleared down the local accounts from there, including the registry. I’ve also just created the default app locker execution rules in group policy. These accounts have full unrestricted access to the server but still can’t launch other applications and services. Unfortunately this includes CMD, so even running a gpresult is proving difficult. Anyone had a similar issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I work with Microsoft products like Azure, inTune, Dynamics and other 365 products to implement modern workplace solutions for our end users. 
 I find it sometimes difficult to have an overview of all future updates and end of life products that are being pushed by Microsoft. It would be nice to have this automated in some way.
 How do you guys manage this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 I started new job, where I will need to do windows server, Azure Vm and VMware host patching
 there are very few servers no WSUS employed or anything else, because they will go away sooner or later 
 my manager asked me about my plan to patch those servers/hosts 
 they are mixes of dev and production 
 I am thinking:
 -Update windows servers when update released (every month) and when critical update is been pushed 
 -Create snapshot for VM before update (is this necessary?)
 -Update VMware server software when new update is released (minor updates for the same version)
 -Update the production servers off hours 
 -Test updates (by running the application and testing all functions)
 -Rollback update if test went wrong
 -For Switches, update one switch after making copy from configurations with old FW
 -Test the switches and be ready to rollback to backup file
 ​
 ​
 is there any ideas or things I need to add to the plan?
 ​
 thanks in advanced

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still rock an old ass RRAS VPN on 2003 VM, obviously it has got to go... with that I have few choices, I can pay more for the already expensive barracuda firewalls to I believe give me a decent VPN client + single sign-on, I'm not sure how I would do 2FA with that but I assume it can do that as it has enough bells & whistles to confuse me anytime I look at it. I also don't look forward to deploying the client to my users, I love built-in windows VPN and it always treated me well.
 OR
 just a new 2019 VM with VPN and somehow enable 2FA on that. 
 OR
 the VM + I wouldn't mind paying for DUO or something similar either, just not sure how that works to be honest with windows VPN server? can it? 
 what say you /r/sysadmin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have seen a rash of bogus emails getting through our filters because its being delivered by DocuSign's legitimate service/address *.docusign.com, *.docusign.net however the sender will be for example "Chase Bank" with a sender email in the body [00014745billing@outlook.com](mailto:00014745billing@outlook.com). Our users are opening them because they trust the DocuSign domain. The few I have investigated redirected to a 365 sign in when you click "review document" or to a static file with an incoherent message that I presume they are trying to get you to download. So I am assuming malware delivery and credential harvesting. All I can say is thank god for MFA and poorly designed fake documents. However I worry its going to hit the right person where the fake document makes sense, like a plausible contract, and the user actually downloads and opens. 
 Besides education is there a better way to lock this down other then blocking DocuSign and having to manually release.
