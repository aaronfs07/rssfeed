It wasn't really a surprise, given the company has over 30k users and over 25k M365 licenses; it'd be impossible to manage the environment without some level of automation.
 We have jobs working in our IAM tool, runbooks in Azure Automation, scheduled flows working in Power Automate, a few sync jobs interacting with AAD that run on application servers, and I know there's one team in the department that has a few scripts they run manually that perform bulk actions in M365, though there are plans to schedule these. And there's undoubtedly more that I don't know about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I designed a network using primarily MikroTik and Ubiquiti for a mid sized hotel. Their request was that they do not want anything that needs expensive memberships. The cost of the equipment wasn't a problem. A logical amoubt for a membership will not be a problem. So i created the network with 4 ubiquiti switches, a MikroTik 48 port PoE switch and a CCR-1016-12G and 2 WANs for redunduncy. I would like to keep all of the existing setup. Please note that the firewall on the MikroTik is well configured, and there is port security on each switch. 
 My question is: would you adding any kind of firewall before the MikroTik router - something like a NGFW or some kindof IPS/IDS? I feel that the mikrotik firewall rules just don't cut it for today's standards and network moniroting and/or blocking is necessary. What kind of firewall could i add before the existing router that could filter trafic before it reaches the internal network?
 Basically it seems like i might need a transparent firewall.

So I am going a VPS route because I am a sysadmin/DevOps and can install/maintain myself and I don't want to fight limitations and obstacles of normal web hosting, managed databases, it even hard to find this combo. Also I don't know what those apps expect from system so VPS is a safe route because you can customize everything.
 So recommend good VPS hosting which also offers sql server (as a separate service or install into VPS from their media/license).
 I can install SQL server myself, that would be even prefered, but I don't want to bother my clients with separate swl server licensing for VM in VPS hosting so I would like that to be solved by VPS provider.

Then two weeks later another user has the same issue as well as me. I found KB5023696 was installed the same day, uninstalled it and RDP began working again. I removed the KB from all of the users whom had RDP issues and this resolved the issue. The two week hold was our RMM software holding back updates as we have it setup. I am not sure why that KB is breaking RDP for users but I hope this helps another sysadmin from trying to determine why RDP broke. The weirdest part is it is hit or miss as some users with the update do not have issues while others can't work at all.

Yet, I think for many of us, we are in this space of being willing to learn, but its hard to understand just what direction. Then when we do choose one, its got 50 branches. 
 ​
 Future seems to be cloud, and IMO not IaaS but PaaS and SaaS.
 Been cruising along and learning Power Platform. This is on top of O365 Teams, SharePoint and all the admin portals to do normal traditional Sysadmin stuff, along with PowerShell scripting and command to admin those portals via CLI.
 Then just the other day I am trying to automate something, and it seems to do it I need to use Microsoft graph. I never even heard of this before two days ago. I was able to setup things in O365 to connect in and "get" the data I wanted. Then I realized that I have no idea how to output it in some readable format for an end user. Looks like Python dictionaries. Pretty sure its web code, I am not a web dev. I know I can figure it out but:
 Where do I draw the line? Where do I focus? I have fun going down each rabbit hole I open, but where do I ensure that I am ultimately valuable as an employee, which in turn means I cand ensure I am compensated? Money isn't everything, but at the end of the day I want to make it, and I am a company man, a 9-5er, a person that likes to clock in and clock out. Whatever you call it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our camera company asked me for a static IP address on our 5-block two weeks ago. I gave them all the info they needed.
 IP address (IP)
 Subnet Mask (SNM)
 Gateway (GW)
 Domain Name Server (DNS)1
 DNS2 
 I forgot to give them a port on our switch. When the install date came, they called me all day asking for assistance. However, I was busy and couldn't return their call. By the time I got back to them, they had already taken the network down, and caused a real mess breaking our connection to the main office, and kicking some remote workers offline. I asked them why they couldn't wait to install it, and they said they had scheduled this two weeks ago. We lost some business over it. About 2 hours where the network was completely down. The camera technician managed to bring it back up somehow. I thought it was their fault, and wrote my boss a Cover Your Ass (CYA) ("mine"). He immediately shot back with "Why didn't you give them a port?!" I'm feeling really stupid over this, and feel like I might be losing my job when I go in Monday. Has anyone ever done this before, and forgotten to tell a vendor which port to use? 
 TLDR: I forgot to give our camera company a port to use their static IP on. Now I'm in some hot water.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 We are considering moving to MS 365 from Google Workspace for a multitude of reasons. Most steps are straightforward, as far as Google Drive, Gmail to Exchange Online (and I've done exchange migrations in the past), etc
 As we are running through our prep checklist with sales department, we realized there is going to be a major snag, that we haven't considered.
 Our Sales team is using their "Google Account" instead of email/password to authenticate against a multitude of services, for example - HubSpot, various marketing sites, and a multitude of other tools that they use.
 Their Google accounts are ["joan.smith@COMPANY.com](mailto:"joan.smith@COMPANY.com)" not "@gmail.com), since "company.com", is now going to be hosted by MS, their "social logins" are now going to be Microsoft's ones, not Google's.
 While I can assist them with migrating a couple of these services to email/password authentication, instead of "Social Login", I'm sure we are not the first people to run into this problem.
 So is there a suggested way to do it? Or are we in the dreaded territory of "VENDOR LOCK IN" ?
 🙀
 P.S.:
 35 people start up. But not a tech one. So we have 1 IT - person - me. Migrating 700 = 35 people x 20-30? Social login accounts on various websites - is not something I want to tackle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 I'm currently stuck with a network problem. Maybe one of you can help me.
 For a shake test of an RJ45 to fiber optic converter, it must be checked for correct functionality during the simulated earthquake.
 What do I have in mind: My idea would be the following structure... Laptop -> (RJ45 cable) -> Converter -> (FO loop TX to RX)
 https://ibb.co/vLvQz5R
 Now I think I know that the UDP protocol is one-way and I can use a python script with the socket library to send a UDP packet over the laptop's ethernet interface to itself over the loop with the converter. If the packet arrives at the open socket, the connection is OK.
 Unfortunately this doesn't work. I receive the sent packet at any time. The packet is probably still delivered internally in the computer and does not leave it via the Ethernet interface. I tried to set up a route locally for the IP used (Route add 192.168.1.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 IF 9). Unfortunately, this also does not bring the desired result.
 I would be very grateful for any food for thought.
 regards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have 50+ HP desktops of the same model new in the box that need to be deployed in the coming weeks. Long story short - we recently had a cyber attack that resulted in us rebuilding our network/servers and we lost a couple of staff along the way who were the ones who usually handled our imaging process. On top of that our software packages have broken links and don't run correctly with the network rebuild, so we're not in good shape.
 The good thing is, most of our staff use the exact same base build on their devices, so if there is a way to clone one good image to multiple devices that are the same model, that would be ideal for this project. We have the software install packages, but manually pushing them can take 2-3 hours per computer and requires a few reboots. We have been lucky thus far to not need to replace a lot of PC's since the outage, and I was able to build several of them as spares to swap out if needed using the manual process.
 I know there are multiple tools out there that do many things, so I am mostly wondering what some recommendations are for something that will get the job done. We do have a couple KVM's so can image multiple at a time - but how do we package a clone of an image to push out, and what does that process look like - especially with joining devices to the domain.
 In my old job at an MSP, we just manually installed everything per device as we had a lot of small companies that requested maybe 2-3 computers at a time on average, so it was not a big deal. Prior to that I worked for a large hospital that had SCCM set up to deploy Windows on PXE boot, which was very nice, but I have no idea how that process was set up. Though I'd like to eventually find the time to create something like that for our environment.

 Their requirements are fairly basic in terms of features: b/w printing, duplex, copy, scan, fax
 I primarily recommend Brother printers to all my small-biz and home office clients, but this is a larger staff and higher print volume than any that I have dealt with in the past.
 Will appreciate the recs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left my last job because it got boring (normal sys-/network admin job), now I'm working as a DevOps & cloud engineer (and as a sysadmin in the shadows)... and to be honest, I think I'm ready to move up a notch again, but I don't really want to leave the company. Tbh they are too small with 30 devs (yet >50% growth per year).
 It's cool that I can help migrate & automate the whole infrastructure and implement new technologies by grinding myself into oblivion, but it seems like I don't have the time to improve the stuff that really needs it - and only build MVPs infrastructure wise, because anything better 'costs too much money - who will pay for this?'. I have no time to tinker like I had some years ago... and our sysadmins are ready waiting for months for some scripts that will make their life 100x easier - but I have no time and now I'm only suffering the perpetual grind of building new novel environments for customers - and can't even do them right because of #AGILE - the sprint is over, bye bye to the budget. Still, colleague wise and in terms of teamwork and communication you can't compare them to any other companies... Quality of life has improved substancially. Less stress - not having to support braindead people is wonderful - but I'm bored.
 I'm feeling like if I don't work on the real, large stuff... on the edge of new tech... I will just lose more time and this will become my new normal. I need to learn new tools, better ways of thinking and want to work on larger projects.
 Anyone here who was in a similar situation? What did you do?
 And nah, I won't post this on /r/devops first, thanks to you guys I even got this far. You'll surely push me further into the abyss.

 We are currently swapping out a bunch of Nexus 3548-X switches and replacing them with 9300 series with VXLAN/EVPN.
 We have an OOB network in place but it's aging and i would like to use 3548 for that. Each of the new OOB switches would perform these functions:
  
connect all management ports for the fabric & console servers
 each leaf would have a dedicated 10G interface to OOB switch for SPAN monitoring
 we wouls transport these SPAN sessions via OOB network to packet brokers and VM for troubleshooting.
 each leaf would have a dedicated 1/10G interface for dataplane monitoring towards OOB switch.
 Each OOB switch would run perfSonar suite in guestshell and perform e2e performance tests - iperf etc.. towards other OOB agents via dedicated VXLAN.
 The collected data would be exported via telemetry
  
Anyone else here doing something similar ? Any advice how to extend OOB for more use-cases ?
 Thanks.

I love the job otherwise and have so much freedom and truly little stress of other tasks or expectations. How do I get over my ego and stay with a company longer?
 EDIT: I didn’t want to spark a debate about the cybersecurity vs sysadmin war. I value people’s time and a business’s right to say no. A few have answered my question perfectly, but the goal here was coaching on being satisfied with a job that has value, but I have a problem when I see need/urgency but leadership sometimes ignores core security for paths of least resistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I have multiple computers I can create clusters (maybe with a technology like k8s), and with a bit of work, I can be sure to have near 100% service uptime. Meaning no matter what, even if something happens, another computer is going to handle the requests and everything will be 100% transparent to the end user. That's because the service was designed to handle such cases, maybe by running inside docker, allowing state recovery, and whatnot.
 But here I am wondering about cloud services (AWS and Azure for example). If my knowledge is up to date, these guys have big machines (like terabytes of RAM and tens of cores on a single motherboard), and they use a hypervisor to split these into smaller VM, that they can then rent.
 But in such a case, they cannot run a single VM on different computers right ? So what do they do if one of their computer suddenly has a break down ? If their architecture is designed like I described in the previous paragraph, then all the VM on that machine suddenly shutdown, and their services are no longer available ? So there is now way that they can promise near 100% machine uptime ?
 And even if you keep your machine 100% healthy, with zero internet downtime, you have your own generator in case of electric failure, how to you update your hypervisor ? Wouldn't they need a reboot from time to time ? And if you need to change components, how do you move a running VM from one machine to another ?
 I am not a sys admin btw, I do datascience and AI, so way more math and way less programming, but I am deeply interested in how they solved the problem, so don't hesitate to start from the basics, and many thanks for your time.

 So lets say I do commercially sign my radius cert company.xy
 Folks using my wifi APs with SSID: mycoy will use this to access the network.
 But someone sets up a rogue AP with the same SSID: mycoy and also commercially signs their radius cert: company.xy. My wifi clients get fooled and take the bait? 
 I'm currently using a private CA for my radius. And distribute the CA to the wifi clients.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably toeing the line of the subreddits rules. I'm sorry if it is. I am NOT looking for help. This is just a genuine curiosity, that I should have asked before.
 I use to work for both Cox and Comcast. Once a router reached EoL status we recommended the customer swap routers.
 Sometimes it felt wrong, especially if the system knew the customer had old equipment, it would just immediately dismiss any other possible issues and refer customer to OEM/Purchase New Router. 
 Other times I would spend 30mins+ checking lines and factory resetting, hardlining into the router and then into the modem and ping testing and guiding the customer through it all just for it to end up being an issue with the EoL Airport. 
 Is it an issue with the outdated firmware handling a more modern modem? or is it just the age of the router and something internally failing? It always felt wrong of me to tell someone to replace the router for it being EoL because otherwise it was capable of handling the customers speeds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone,
 So we are running Azure AD Connect and just hybrid syncing Edge. The auto login works fine.
 We have no licenses besides the free Azure AD Connect. The Edge Sync has always worked fine, bookmarks, etc.
 Suddenly I have all of my existing users still syncing, even if logging into a workstation they have never used before. But somewhere along the line new user accounts after "X" date are not syncing. It shows the following in edge://sync-internals/ 
 DISABLED_BY_ADMIN, STOP_SYNC_FOR_DISABLED_ACCOUNT, Microsoft Information Protection service is disabled" 
 So after a bunch of trial and error, the only option I had was to do the P2 License Trial just to see what happened and enable ESR. And of course that works, the new users are now able to sync.
 So my questions are, 
 1: Has anyone seen or run into this before? I am seeing conflicting info about how we should not have been able to sync at all without a P1/P2 license to begin with, and other places say no that basic sync was enabled a year or two ago.
 2: Since I have the trial P2 license, I have not assigned any licenses to any users, just enabled ESR. Can I get away with just a single license after the trial to keep ESR enabled?

Out of the blue I get a txt from their new IT person requesting credentials for all systems etc I proceeded to contact new owner that approved this request as I was told absolutely nothing. Well we or I should say me working on behalf of my company sold backup solution which was contracted for 3 years. New IT people says out backups are interfering with theirs and want us to remove the backup. We now have given the customer the invoice to buy out of the contract which is 11 grand and they are crying about it. I want to say be cool with your IT person as maybe this could have gone down for this customer in a better way if they had just reached out and talked with me explaining how they were bringing in their own people. The original owner never said a word or anything yet I was there for them every step of the way even during snow storms to drive there before business opened to push power buttons on surge protectors to turn equipment back on because no one could remember how to push this button even after explaining a few times. Anyways they signed contract and we are going to hold them to it and let it go to collections if needed

 but: as most of our devices are lenovo devices and intune gets the full MTM instead of a friendly name, we have too much products created automaticaly in freshservice.
 has anybody an idea, how to get this fixed and use user-friendly family names instead of the complete MTM?
 example:
 Model (machine type) = 20FMS08H00
 The first 4 digits (20FM) denote the readable model: ThinkPad T460
 This includes MTM with (20FM,20FN)
 The MTM <-> Family can be seen in the table https://download.lenovo.com/bsco/schemas/list.conf.txt
 has anybody already dealed with this?
 maybe a a solution is written here: https://www.systanddeploy.com/2023/01/get-list-uptodate-of-all-lenovo-models.html
 Which refers to these scripts: https://github.com/damienvanrobaeys/Lenovo_Models_Reference
 but i have no idea how to implement it in freshservice
 ​
 other idea was, to write back the family name in intune and map this to product in the app. but i´m not a friend of using wrong fields for other purposes. custom attributes is only available for mac devices. not for win. so any other idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 90% sure the culprit is a particular LOB app. The LOB app support claims that it is impossible (after multiple escalations) 
 What it boils down to is that SOMETHING is creating a mapped drive as the "system user". This results in the drive showing up as "disconnected" but yet still working when you click on it. However this makes certain functionalities of the program trying to access that drive flakey. This system user mapping takes place "before" the normal user drive mapping gpo takes place. 
 The only way to resolve it is to use psexec and run:
  
psexec -s -i cmd.exe
 net use :x /delete
  
If you do this, then log off the profile and back on, the gpo takes over and properly maps the drive as the user and everything is fine until the next reboot.
  
Things tried/checked:
  
Log on/off Scripts (none)
 Scheduled Task
 GPO (Disabled all of them)
 Startup Items (using lastruns)
 Registry (even manually deleted any possible reference) 
 Uninstalled LOB app then manually deleted any folders or files related to it, including appdata, etc
  
Where else could this possibly "live"? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

 I'm a 26-year-old with a background in networking and computer hardware, as well as experience in sales, inventory management, and SAP. 
 I'm not from the US.
 I worked for about 3 years in a computer store that sold anything under the sun, think amazon but with local stores and fixing computers in the back office. After 2 years I became the manager of that store and had 3 workers under me.
 After leaving my job as a computer store manager, I traveled Europe with my girlfriend in a motorhome. Now that I have some free time, I'm planning to study for the CCNA certification and pursue a career as a sys admin.
 I studied networking in high school through a Cisco program, and while I had the knowledge for CCNA, I never got the certificate. After highschool I was in the army ( I was a tank driver) so I forgot most of my ccna knowledge a I had.
 I also have experience with light server administration through my home server running OMV and several Raspberry Pis.
 I'm interested in hearing your advice on what areas I should focus on as I work toward becoming a sys admin. I believe I'll have to start in a help desk role and work my way up, but I'm not sure what specific skills and knowledge I should prioritize. Are there other certifications or training programs that you would recommend? How much will a degree help and if it will, in what subject? 
 Before the computer store I did 3 months in tech support in an isp, but hated every second.
 I'm eager to learn and grow in this field, and I would appreciate any advice you can offer based on your experiences. Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was presented with a laptop that would boot but the screen would be stay black. The client had already removed the bottom so I first checked some of the hardware and made sure it wasn’t stuffed full of dust or anything. Then I put it back on to start troubleshooting other ways
  
I tried restarting
 using the fn keys to see if the screen was simply dimmed down all the way
 I tried plugging into external monitors to see if maybe it was the laptop screen but they wouldn’t display anything either.
 I then booted into the bios and it worked. 
  
I was going to see if maybe there was a firmware update or something that caused this and thought maybe I should roll it back but I thought maybe it would be best to just see if I can get into windows first. I was able to without any issues. 
 My question is.. why did booting into the bios fix the issue? Any ideas? 
 Also, does anyone else get mixed feelings when this kind of thing happens. I feel happy that I was able to help them but I also feel imposter syndrome because I don’t totally know how I fixed the issue… sorry for writing so much. Hope you are having a nice day.

Problem is UCEPROTECT blocks ranges of our IPs for assumingly no reason and it's getting pretty annoying because they are basically extorting us and our customers at this point for 100s of dollars. I was not to worried about it before because basically they are known to be scammy but recently we have had customers getting bouncebacks from Microsoft and Gmail services as well. Why all of a sudden is Gmail and Microsoft (Hotmail) subscribing to UCEPROTECT? Anyone else having these issues or is there something else we can do?

 I am looking at two models for this:
 9300-24U or 9300-24UB. The UB has a deep buffer and is intended for rich multi-media lossless content. 
 Now, what I am not sure about is if its worth paying that extra money for the "Deep Buffer" version for 4-5 10Gbit Clients connected to Cisco, connected to the SNS Evo 16 working on 1080/4k content. 
 Anybody know?
 Thanks for your time.

 They're immediately up-front with what the position is, what the pay is, and even attaches the detailed job description in the very first message.
 Are you paying attention, recruiters? THAT is how you attract the attention of quality people who are going to be what you want. Stop beating around the bush; put the important information front and center, with a reasonable salary, and you'll have the position filled in no time.
 (For the record I turned it down as the salary is still well below what I'm currently getting, but I did reply and complimented him on how much I appreciated him not wasting either of our time)

 "Engineer Shopping", according to him, is when someone gets told "no" about accessing something, then goes around that person and/or over their head until they find the weak spot that says "yes". The weak spot could potentially be exploited if the user was a bad actor, and that's the type of thing they look for.
 I believe the guy, but I want to learn more about it - because I'm encountering a user just like that. It sure seems like it should be a CyberSecurity issue, but what do I look up?
 p.s. I thought this was too simplistic for the CyberSecurity sub - after reading some of their discussions.
 Thank you!

 The configuration is dead nuts simple- single WAN, 2 vlans. I want VLAN A to get anywhere, but I want VLAN B to ONLY be able to access the internet WAN, not VLAN A.
 Over simplified, yes- but you get it. And I know it's an extremely easy solution- I just can't seem to wrap my head around it using access lists, etc so I am really hoping someone is willing to hold my hand. I haven't had to muck around in a Cisco for about 10 years.
 This is in a production environment, with a permit all access list for each VLAN so I really don't want to start to mess around and put the place into a tail spin. I just think the answer is in there somewhere. I tried to convince them to source a guy who knows Cisco better than I, but they want me to do it. I know I can, I am just really, really rusty- so I am reaching out for a little help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, we are an exchange online hybrid environment and I'm having an issue with one user who is not able to access public folders via the Microsoft 365 Outlook client. When clicking into any public folder- the user gets a message that says "Cannot display the folder. Unknown Error" within the pane where the contents of the public folders are to be displayed. This issue started today.
 Background: 
  
User's mailbox is on exchange online 
 Public folders are hosted on exchange online.
 No one else seems to be having this issue
 New users I am creating on exchange online do not have this issue.
 No reports of other users having this issue including myself
 As of yesterday it was still working
 User is able to access the public folders via outlook.office365.com by adding the public folders to favorites on the left hand pane.
  
Solutions tried:
  
Recreating Outlook Profile and deleting the .ost file - Did not work
 Repaired Microsoft Office 365 suite - Did not work
 Set up outlook profile on two other machines within the network - Did not work.
 Set up outlook profile on a machine outside of the network - Did not work.
 Tried playing around with cached/uncached mode - Did not work.
  
I have created a ticket for Microsoft support as I'm suspecting this is one of the weird service issues that are affecting a small number of users. They haven't responded and was wondering is anyone experiencing this issue? Last thing I want to do is to recreate the person's AD account or something along those lines. There isn't a detailed error message for me to go off of and this is driving me nuts and most users within our environment rely heavily on public folders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This maybe an odd post, but I was introduced recently to a Framework laptop. I had heard of them before, but never thought about the device or looked into them. However a coworker picked one up and is evaluating it for a few weeks.
 I took a quick look and while it is pretty basic in design, it overall looks and feels like a nice laptop. Light, good keyboard and trackpad, 3:2 display (glossy but the new ones can be ordered mat), open with one finger, P series processors, and the interchangeable USBC ports is pretty slick. Top it off everything can be changed or upgraded easily.
 Downsides are there is just one size, but a 16" coming later this year, no TB ports, battery life is meh at 5-6 hours, and fans can spin up when under load.
 Curious if anyone has used these at scale or any feedback on them? It sort of reminds of a generic laptop but with a decent build quality.

 I've never used Allied Telesis before so this is new to me. I've done some googling but there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of resources out there for this brand. The Allied telesis documentation is extensive, but hard to navigate, so I wouldn't be surprised if I just didn't find the correct document on how to do this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While looking at all these jobs posting for in-person work (while I'm already happily employed), I've realized a big question looms:
 What's the price differential that it would take for me to return to full-time in-person work from remote?
 I'm not really worried about people that are saying "I'll never do it", since you're already staking a claim outside the conversation. I'm more curious for those who would consider it (like me), and what factors you'd weigh into the value of that work. I'm obviously considering equal factors with work environment, on-call, benefits packages, etc.
 I think my absolute minimum looks something like this:
 ((Time To Get Ready in AM) + (Commute Time Round Trip)) * Approximate OT Hourly Rate * 250 work days PLUS vehicle costs for that year.
 So for example, a $72k remote job, to move in person with a 30 minute commute each way would really need:
 ((1 hour + 1 hour) * 54 * 250) + (($400 car payment + $100 insurance + $100 gas)*12)
 $34.2k more, or $106,200 total. Even then, I might be able to find that same $72k remote for $95-100k remote and maintain my valuable personal time.
 What about you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm encountering a strange problem with TACACS+ that I've never seen before (or at least never noticed). When an incorrect password is entered on a client device I would expect a 'Password:' request message to be sent by the TACACS+ server, a reply from the client containing the password, and then a 'password incorrect' message back from the server. This does indeed happen, but then immeadiately afterward the client sends the password for a second time, despite me only having entered it once. This goes to happen a further two times before the server eventually sends a 'authentication failed' and it all stops. Resulting in a total of 4 messages being sent by the client containing the password (again at this point I have only entered it once). 
 This wouldn't normally be a problem except we are authenticating TACACS against AD, which locks out users after 3 incorrect password attempts. Because the TACACS+ client sends the password a total of 4 times, the users is immidiately locked out of their AD account if they enter their password incorrectly just once.
 I'm seeing the same behavoir on both Nokia and Juniper (mx, srx, qfx) clients, and have now replicated it in a lab using a completely different TACACS+ server (TACGUI) and the junos olive image. I'm also very confident it is not the SSH client as it happens with putty, secureCRT, mobaXterm, and the buildin ssh client on a Linux box.
 I'm really stumped as to what is causing these clients to send the password a total or four times, even though it has already been rejected, and the user is not entering it again. Is this expected behavoir? Can I stop it? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
 Regards,
 Frustrated Network Engineer

 Common scenario - multiple sites linked together by IPSec tunnels, segmentation firewalls, you name it. You need to allow traffic from machine A to machine B, and that passes through firewalls X, Y, and Z.
 Do you:
  
Create matching firewall policies on all devices, restricting source/dst IP & port
 Create one restrictive policy on the firewall closest to traffic source (machine A), and looser 'catch-all' rules on the other firewalls
 Create one restrictive policy on the firewall closest to traffic destination (machine B) and looser 'catch-all' rules on the other firewalls.
  
To me, "1." feels most secure, but 2 feels like the best balance between security (block bad traffic before it hits anything else in the network) and not having to triple my work.
 Thoughts?

 I'm trying to setup OSPF in a linux-lab using FRR/Quagga where I have the need to separate two areas but everything I've thrown at it thus far has failed - Anyone out there has any experience implementing an inter-area filter? It appears it's not an unheard of functionality (see this post: https://packetlife.net/blog/2010/feb/10/ospf-filtering-inter-area-vs-intra-area/) but I haven't successfully managed to implement the filter-list parameter thus far...
 It would also appear that the received wisdom of the internet would be that in case you're in need of route filtering, BGP would be the preferred setup but I'll be running that as an external protocol and would, for curiosity's sake, prefer not to implement it as an internal protocol. :)
 Any assistance would be appreciated. Surrender is definitely an option.

The tunnel interface has a 169.254.0.1 IP per the configuration file for the connection. I've added inbound and outbound rules to the Network Security Group to allow traffic to/from that IP. However traffic does not pass. We are using AD servers instead of Azure AD. This allows us to continue to use Group Policies.
 Is there some routing somewhere in Azure that can be modified to allow this traffic? Capturing traffic at the firewall, I can see traffic exiting the firewall on the tunnel interface to Azure, but nothing in reply.

Instead of just applying for jobs at my current level I've always tried to apply for jobs that will stretch my current skills.
 -Because of events beyond my control, agressive resume polishing, and one company's desperate need to hire someone I am now the recipient of a paycheck more than twice the size of my last one and a Senior Engineer Level IT title. How do I go about not fucking this up?
 Edit #2: this is some of what I did previously...
 SSL cert updates
 Set up scheduled task with PowerShell scripts,
 IIS configuration
 Configured SCCM update roll outs
 Configuration management
 managing production servers
 Set-up Azure VDI
 Group policy management
 ​
 Edit #3: the new position seems to be heavy on cloud platforms, some scripting, and project work, my last job was project heavy so nothing new there. I've done some cloud stuff so fingers crossed there. My scripts are low shelf but mostly functional.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The renewal of the data centre is imminent and this will result in some changes. Currently, all gateways of the DC Vlans are on the firewall. With the new design, we are considering whether to change this. The datacenter core will be formed by a vPC Nexus pair. The consideration is then to transfer all SVIs ( with HRSP) to the Nexus pair. ospf should then announce the routes to the Nexthop router (firewall) and vice versa. In this way, the north-south traffic can be regulated and monitored via the firewall.
 The question now is: how can I handle the east-west traffic? InterVlan communication can then no longer be monitored and regulated. One possible solution would be to use VRFs on the Nexus switches. These are then routed to the firewall via a separate transfer network.
 At the moment, the throughput of the firewall is not a problem, but since we can connect servers with higher speed due to the new hardware, there could be an increase.
 What is the best way to implement this in the data centre in terms of security? How do you do it? Maybe someone can give me some comments and recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this is better here or on a linux sub. I wanted to try here first because I think the issue is more about routes than linux. Can anyone spot an issue with my routing?
 I'm trying to set up a web app on a centos box. There are two nics, both have addresses in the dmz and the same gateway. eth1 is nat'ed to a public IP address. eth0 is used for inside traffic only. I've verified the needed ports are open to the outside using powershell Test-NetConnection. The issue is that on the outside the page hangs and then times out. On the inside lan it loads fine. 
 Initially it was the opposite. Page would load only on the internet, I added an internal route and now internal lan is the only one that works.
 I can ping inside and outside addresses from both nics. I used ifdown and ifup to verify them one at a time.
 Can anyone spot an issue that would cause outside requests to not receive a response?
 Internal design:
 10.2.1.0/24 - internal lan
 10.1.1.0/23 - dmz
 10.1.1.1 - dmz gateway
 10.1.1.54 - eth0 to internal network
 10.1.1.55 - eth1 nat'ed to public ip
 ​
 Results from "ip route" command:
 default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth1 proto static metric 101 
 10.1.1.0/23 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.1.54 metric 100 
 10.1.1.0/23 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.1.55 metric 101

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently evaluating our global server portfolio. Globally we have 200 remote satellite offices with HPE Gen10/Gen10+ that run 3-5 VMs on top of a VMware hypervisor. 20 manufacturing plants and other “business critical” datacenters. These are running a cluster of HPE Gen10/10+ using a shared Dell storage. 
 We have had a lot of problems with HPE global support so now that we are evaluating Gen11s, we’ve decided to throw the Dell VxRail into the evaluation and Dells HCI solution. 
 Any tips/advice/experience with Dell vs HPE?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this question isn't super high level, but it's a bit more complex than r/iphone would be able to help with. 
 At my job we had a bunch of iPhone users lose a good portion of their contacts. We have corporate Gmail and originally their email/calendar/contacts were set up in iOS Mail using Activesync. Everyone assumed that this information was a 2-way sync, i.e. for example a contact entered manually on the phone would automatically sync up to the cloud, and any change they made in the cloud contacts would sync down to the phone. Seems like this was not the case though and manually-entered contacts were only getting stored locally on the phone, yet they were still attached to the contact list associated to the Activesync account.
 Recently the Messaging Team decided to phase this out and have everyone use the Gmail app instead. Problem is someone accidentally cut off the Activesync access before End User Support had a chance to migrate their data. Users started getting a persistent prompt to update their password, but this didn't work because the account was gone from the system essentially. People got fed up and just deleted the account, this process does not offer any option to keep stored contacts, you have the ability to either Erase or Cancel.
 Now in the texts and other apps there are phone numbers with no name attached. In some cases it's hundreds/thousands of contacts. Is there any recourse to get these back?

This isn't on a VM. Each time I've tried running sysprep the log returns with the error that BitLocker is on... but it isn't.
 I've typed manage-bde -status to check and it says fully decrypted. I've tried turning BitLocker on/off. I've cleared and disabled the TPM (this particular laptop has no PTT). I tried deleting the Panther folder's contents.
 BitLocker never started encrypting in the first place, only when I started it manually to try the on/off idea. Is there something I'm missing with this problem?

All the information I’ve received so far is hearsay, but it seems that upper management is considering outsourcing security to a third party company and firing the internal security team. It’s been almost two weeks since the incident stopped, but we are all somehow still employed.
 The team was advised by the C-Suite that we are primary witnesses to the incident and that we may be involved in the litigation process from customers. It seems that I may be questioned by lawyers in the future based on my testimony. We have been asked to prepare a statement and timeline of the work we have completed near the incident.
 I’ve completely given up on having any future with this company and I am doing just what I need to do to stay on payroll as long as possible while I look for another job. I do not trust anything my employer says/does.
 Has anyone ever had to testify on behalf of their company? Do I really have to? 
 Would the statement I create affect my future unemployment claim? Also, if this goes legal, does this mean my job has a reason to keep me on payroll longer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a customer running QuickBooks 2023 on a RDS that is also a DC. I know it isn't ideal, but its a single-server environment. Its also a hosted VM. If you are one of those "QB doesn't work on a VM" people, please do not respond to this thread. It normally works fine, I have many customers on this scenario, including other DC/RDS combo VMs and the only issue is the conflict with the DNS server service. 
 Anyone familiar with this topic knows there are two fixes to the service conflict:
 1 - netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange commands
 2 - script having the QuickBooksDB## service start BEFORE the DNS Server service
 ​
 OK, so hopefully we're on the same page here. Now to the NEW issue.
 For this customer, an earlier version of QuickBooks was working fine with the script-service-start-order workaround, for years. Then we upgrade to QuickBooks 2023. I know the number in the service name changed, I accounted for that. 
 The new issue with QB2023 is not that the QuickBooksDB33 service doesn't start - it does. The issue is severe slowness in the QuickBooks program when the DNS Server service is running. Stop that service, QuickBooks runs well again. I have tried the excludedportrange commands (yes for the dynamic port listed in Database Service Manager) and port 8019, both TCP and UDP. I have tried the "starting services in the proper order" workaround, this does not work either. 
 I've researched and beat up on this issue for hours. Asking other Redditors is my last attempt before telling the customer they need two hosted servers so I can move the AD roles and DNS off of the RDS. Has anyone else experienced this with specifically QuickBooks 2023 on a DC?

 Is there a better alternative to learning EVPN on a virtual platform? Preferably cisco, but I am open to alternatives.
 I have had a setup with Cumulus networks and their virtual appliance, but the problem there was the fact that in my opinion it's a very niche player with little adoption in the real world.
 Preferably something that can be run in VMWare or EVE-NG, if at all possible.
 Any recommendations?

 So Server 2012R2 is still occasionally receiving Edge and Chrome updates to the 109 build.
 The last one was 7 days ago, and they will continue until Oct EOL (or hopefully longer through the ESU period)
 https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=edge%20109.0.1518.95 
 So nessus is still reporting that we need to go to the latest version (which isn't possible on 2012R2), it seems to ignore these 109 security updates which are clearly combating new critical vulnerabilities. The trouble is, Microsoft doesn't seem to give any details on these stealth 109 updates and what CVE's they resolve.
 Is this ultimately a nessus reporting issue or a MS one - in regards to the lack of information about 109 updates and how they are managed/logged in the future?

Boss said okay because customer was an old friend. Every few weeks this customer will call us to complain about how crap his server is and how often his billing server app crashes. (Billing app was made by his "IT genius" son that works as a music teacher and his app is a pile of crap). I explained to him multiple times that this server is the best we can do for free (Intel Xeon E3-1245v5, 32 GB ram, 1tb hdd) and we are not gonna spend months analyzing the crappy code his son made to fix it for free. But he just wont understand and keeps calling and annoying us. This morning he called and asked "Why is my server so slow ?" Im just done being serious with this customer so I told him I dont know he has to call Microsoft and then i pretended I couldnt hear him anymore and I hanged up and didnt picked up his next calls lol. For future calls when im bored, any advice about fun creative ways to mess with that customer ? Boss doesnt care because customer pays nothing lol

 My eyes are starting to hate me for it and by the evening they now refuse to focus on even quite large text.
 Any tips to avoid this or get better at taking long-distance breaks?
 I know the ideal is two hours screen time, twenty minutes looking into the distance then twenty years hiking in the forest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I have a probably simple question about IP address management but I am very new to networking so I am grateful for answers.
 So if I have a Class C network e.g. 192.168.0.0 with all kind of devices (notebooks, printers, IoT etc). Is it good enough to give static IPs to some devices on my DHCP server and leave the rest dynamically allocated or is it recommended to also use subnets e.g. with subnet mask 255.255.254.0 to then potentially have 4 subnets
 192.168.0.0/26 192.168.0.128/26 192.168.1.0/26 192.168.1.128/26
 so I can give devices in different subnets? What would be the advantages of that? Is this more secure and faster? Or am I thinking wrong and I do need VLANs to have those advantages? I know I can use both in that they do not exclude each other because they act on different layers. But other then that I am a little confused.
 I am very helpful for any links and resources to learn more about this topic or any hints what is best to do. I am not fully understanding the implications here yet I guess.
 Many thanks in advance!

 I noticed that I have a recommendation to Enable Tamper Protection for some devices.
 Checking, those devices are all Windows Server 2016.
 Looking in intune I noticed that I've done a configuration profile for it some time ago but in each of those devices the configuration result as "non applicable".
 So I've spent a good 15 minutes googling for the cause and find some workaround.
 On MS site I didn't find nothing meaningfull rapidly so.... I switched tab to chatGPT and I've asked him (or her) about this behaviour.
 The answer has been quite rapid and usefull. I'll not past it here cause it out of the scope of this post.
 ​
 And this is only an example. Let's say, I know it is good for programming, but I've used it also for commercial support like:
 ChatGPT what are some switch models that meet this requirements ?Can you suggest me more models ?Ok, now, from all the models you have suggested me, what is the cheaper ?
 Before it I know I would have done a lot of google search here and there and then amazon or google shopping to find some prices indications ... 
 This thing is so useful that it cannot last longer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks. I'm hoping this is a super easy question...
 We're currently in the process of moving away from Sophos to Microsoft 365 Defender for all of our fleet, and my question is whether I am able to combine onboarding methods without running into any issues? 
 Current thinking is to continue onboarding via SCCM and Intune, but then I'm hopng to also deploy a GPO to catch any machines that aren't communicating back, or for those servers and other edge cases that have been kept off management systems intentionally. In these instances, the GPO would likely hit machines that have already been onboarded via one of the methods above. Has anybody run into any issues doing it that way?
 Side question... for the "local script" onboarding method, Microsoft states that it has been optimised for ten machines only, due to some settings that expidite telemetry data from the machines, so suitable for pilot groups only. Is there a version of this that I can run that would just onboard them with the standard settings in the other packages? My google skills appear to be lacking...
 Thanks all! May your Friday be peaceful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Recently in our Win11 estate (latest versions via GPO) has started to 'lose' user files and folders in the OS. These have been discovered in TreeSize (run as local admin) in hidden folders named 'found.000', 'found.001' etc. These directories are not visible to the OS even with hidden folders enabled. In some instances, it's possible to cut/paste files back to the original locations (with associated integrity checks) but in other cases there are several TBs of files and folders lost and in most cases renamed with an appended number.
 I understand that these are chkdisk fragmented files or they have been moved by chkdisk. Is there a method or utility to restore these files and directories and 'fix' the issues that chkdisk identified without a manual trawl through?
 The scale is such that I would consider a commercial software solution.
 Many thanks.

 I am looking for some assistance in an issue we've had for a while where I work. I'll try and describe it as best as I can not to waste your time.
 ​
 We have been experiencing issues with websites timing out for a while now. It is sporadic and doesn't happen on any particular websites. It can be one website sometimes, then it works fine 5 minutes after, and then five minutes after the website working before, times out now. One thing that seems consistent is when a website times out, it seems to be able to load afterwards.
 ​
 There is no real other network impact, internal seems to be fine, servers seem to be running fine internally. 
 Pinging is no issue, NSlookup is no issue.
 I've noticed that when trying to load a website, it may be very slow but connecting anyway. In Devtools it will have a stalled time on 15+ seconds and the rest seems perfectly fine.
 We have a setup of 4 MS250, 2 MS425, 2 MX84. Everything is completely firmware updated and have tried restarts just to make sure. 
 We've had 2 different network consultants come and have a look at it, with no luck. I've written to our ISP but the issue seems to be non existent when connecting directly to our Edge router, so they're positive the issue is at our end, and the consultants are positive the issue is at the ISP end. 
 We are at a loss, and this is why I turn to reddit in my final hour of sanity. To hopefully find the hero who has the answer to my prayers.
 Thank you.

We recently combined with another company in another state. They have Palo Alto HA and we have Sophos HA. Replacing our 13 year old Sophos is on the table. We'd also like a better VPN system. We use OpenVPN (hate the DNS registration issues because of separate DHCP, etc). They use Global Protect which doesn't stay connected at the logon screen when switching users. We'd love to get a better VPN system as well but I don't think we want a subscription based hardware device, etc.
  
Are there any alternatives to VPN that would allow an application to communicate through an office network and across the vendor T1 line? Zero Trust is such a buzz word but I don't think any of the turn key solutions work for this.
 If VPN is still needed, what is the best option these days?
 Should we keep users split to connect to their closest office 100/100?

 It seems like from what we have been able to scrounge up, the previous IT group had attempted to rename the domain from aaa to bbb, and while most things seem to work properly like ADUC, we are unable to access the Group Policy Management tool, as it still points to the old domain, and does not seem to see the new one at all.
 We have attempted to fix this by running things like:
 gpfixup /olddns:aaa.com /newdns:bbb.local
 gpfixup /oldnb:aaa /newnb:bbb
 [reboot]
 rendom /clean
 rendom /end
 And while all of these seem to run successfully and without error, Group Policy is still inaccessible. We also found the Domainlist.xml:

Most of them have outdated configs, especially regarding zone-based firewall rules. Now I am trying to go through all routers and to understand how they were designed(from a zone-based firewall perspective)(there is no proper documentation - so I have to reverse engineer this thing) . Is there any easier way to do this? Most of the time I end up with paper and a pan and I try to do draw a scheme. Any suggestions? Is there software out there that can map this stuff.? I could suggest buying it if it would provide a better way to document everything.

 If the traffic in the reverse direction has no marking, how does our network on the return trip know to prioritize it? If it's supposed to be marked from their cloud systems back to us for prioritization it's essentially not being prioritized from them to us. Is this the right logic? Please drop some insight, it would be appreciated.

 I actually assumed everything is ok until the senior came in from holiday to see that I messed something up. All the sales people were freaking out and I suspect tomorrow I might be having some conversations. They were calling some other vendors to see if they have issues on their end and even our director got involved. For the first time I felt true outage panic mode and I suspected it would be my fault, which only made it worse.
 I knew something like this would eventually happen, this is a lesson I’m not forgetting any time soon. Looking forward to more fails and more lessons though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/sysadmin,
 I'm in a bit of a dilemma here and I'm hoping to get some advice from the community. I've been tasked with data migration in SharePoint online sites, initially the "guru" admin said automation is not possible and we've all concluded that I can do this in 3-4 months, and during a couple of weeks, I was able to create a small script that can almost automate the entire process. With this script, I could move thousands of sites in just a few days, possibly even over a weekend.
 Here's my problem: I'm not sure if I should tell my boss about this script or not. On one hand, it could save the company a lot of time and resources, and I believe it's something they should know. On the other hand, I don't want to risk getting only a pat on the back for all my hard work.
 So my question is, should I tell my boss about my script? And if I do, how do I approach the conversation and ask for some sort of bonus or remuneration for my efforts?
 Some important context that I've missed out:
  
I work for a subsidiary company, they pay me and my salary is almost x3 time bigger than it was a year ago
 Theres an ongoing discussion of invoicing my time for the parent company since I've already helped them a lot and they realised that they need me. The boss I'm talking about is the lead IT from the parent company

 I'm attempting to NAT an inside global address to an outside global address over two subinterfaces on a Cisco ASR-1000x. Currently, we are using an inside global hrsp address to hit our cisco edge routers so perhaps the single MAC over multiple inside globals is causing an issue, I'm not sure. Anyways, these are the two config variations I've attempted:
 office-rtr-edge-01#
 conf t
 ip nat inside source static [inside global] [outside global]
 interface po3.999
 ip nat inside
 interface po3.997

 This is the show ip nat statistics:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My boss is an electrical engineer who somehow got the position as lead IT architect. Granted he's pretty good at tricking out his desktop theme but his 'ideas' are usually VERY bad. In this weeks drama, I have setup our DNS servers with load balancing and a 5 second health check. Boss wants to set our TTL to 6 seconds with the argument people using the site wouldn't notice the 5 second outage before the LB updates and we can be more nimble with DNS changes.
 Next up is a project manager that wants the TTL set to 12 hours so we can fix any DNS issues before anybody notices.
 I have spent 3 hours in a meeting with both of them trying explain why we want longer ttl than 6 seconds, but less than 12 hours. Once I address the ttl that's too short, the other says "great, set it at 12 hours". Then while I'm explaining why we want it less than 12 hours, the other says "great, 6 seconds",
 It's currently at 10 min because the PM's project makes alot of changes to their site and want the changes to take immediate effect for all of the public, but doesn't understand that the 12 hour TTL is completely opposite of that.
 The EE doesn't understand the additional latency of clients having fresh dns queries every 6 seconds. 
 They are wearing me down and one of the stupid ideas is going to win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having an issue with a Ruckus 7750. I'm attempting to place ACLs inbound and outbound on all my VLANs, but I keep running into an error that there aren't enough hardware resources. In talking to Ruckus support, it came to light that the hardware limits on outbound ACLs are much tighter than inbound ACLs. In the Ruckus world (not sure if this applies to other brands as well) inbound means traffic going into the switch from the VLAN and outbound means going into the VLAN from the switch which brings me to my question...
 Is it normal or best practice to have ACLs on each VLAN in both directions? It seemed like the most secure thing to do to me, but if switches are built with more resources available for inbound ACLs (from the VLAN to the switch), is it best practice to only use inbound ACLs? Are these Ruckus switches just garbage?
 Any help on this would be appreciated. I did do some Googling before posting here but didn't come up with much.

 A contractor left the firm and their mailbox was converted to shared and licenses removed. When they rejoined their sign in was unblocked and licenses restored however their shared mailbox was not converted back. Thus they have a mailbox in the normal admin 365 view but in exchange their mailbox shows up as shared. 
 How can I be sure these are the same mailboxes ? Or does he now have two sets ? I want to convert back to regular without affecting the user. The mailbox sizes are slightly different 300kb or so. 
 I’ll do some testing and figure it out anyway but just thought it was interesting and curious if anyone has done this before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 We use BatchPatch in combination with WSUS to handle patching of Windows Servers in our environment.
 After applying the latest patches we have seen some strange behavior relating to the recent enforcement of the DCOM changes.
 We have multiple subnets where a standalone BatchPatch "server" resides in each subnet.
 In one of the environments the BatchPatch server is unable to Check for updates, see CPU usage and so on after applying the latest updates. The target servers return the WMI Access Denied error.
 In another environment Batchpatch is able to Check for updates, see CPU usage etc.
 Using winver to check the build number, the build number is identical on the BatchPatch servers and the target servers in both environments. Windows Firewall configuration is identical, the servers are even part of the same domain, have the same GPOs applied etc.
 We have three questions and would appreciate any feedback on either one:
  
Is there something we can do to make BatchPatch continue to work? We thought it was the vendor's responsibility to make sure that their tools continue to work post DCOM hardening. And it does work, in one of the subnets as per BatchPatch documentation.
 If there is something we can do, should we avoid that due to security concerns? 
 Are there any other tools for Patch Management you recommend that work 100% post DCOM hardening? Preferably in-house/on-prem tools due to legal constraints. Must be able to schedule when the Servers reboot, automatic reboots are out of the question. The tool should preferably be agent-less but if agents are the only way (or a much better way) we'll go with anything that works. 
  
Thanks in advance!

So we get X amount of GBs per month. If we use them up we need to purchase more (that's expensive af!). I have a Fortigate 100E which does all the content filtering. Students access the Internet and internal resources through a Aruba 505 cluster.
 We have enough data quota but these kids are using different kinds of VPN software to circumvent firewall restrictions. Before you ask, I have blocked all these in multiple levels (application filter, Web filter, and DNS filter). The only opened ports for them are 443, 80, and few other ports for internal systems. This setup blocks all well-known VPNs and proxy tools. But these teenage buggers always find some crappy VPN app or a proxy site that is conveniently not included in Fortigate blacklists. I usually monitor the usage patterns and identify these. Then I block them manually. It has been a game of whack-a-mole for a long time and I am getting tired. How do ya'll block these kinds of things? Is there any one-off way to do this? (policies are already in place but it's really hard to make teenagers comply with them. So before you say it, no I cannot just scare them into not using VPNs).

 The one and only reason I can think about is to be able to route a /32 public address in order to save a limited pool of addresses.
 Some might algo point that by doing it with a private prefix you don't open your gateway to the internet, but given that usually all switches/routers have firewall is this really a security measure now a days? If you think from a DDoS point of view, sure, you'll be able to target that equipment with a public address, however, with a private prefix set, one you can target the client and all the traffic would still go through the gateway anyway.

 I can do this by writing some code but if there is something already in place, I'm happy to use that solution. Below is the WLC in use.

 TL;DR; Competitors sending abuses on our IP's/domains for no reason. Hosting provider said its not a problem since those abuse emails are stupid and pointless and we did nothing wrong but they legaly should have a response from me and forward it.
 So we have a 3 basic servers, one for database, two for web application. Database is closed for internet, only available localy and web applications only 80 port. I have a openvpn server on smallest vps just to have an access to servers 22 by ssh and marketing guy could have an access to database directly (Before you will scream - the guy knows what is he doing and his user have only read access on sales table). So yesterday he visited competitors website to check their prices (literally clicked 1 link and left) and they sent abuse email that someone from our network IP visited their website ONCE and he wasnt on site for 30+ secs so search engine thought it was a bad visit and could derank their website. It's not a problem for this case, but they sending abuses on weekly basis like we have pirated scripts (that I wrote myself, just some JS popups), non licensed windows (but our servers are linux based), etc.
 We cant go against them in legal field since their legal entity placed in different country and just not worth it. 
 What can we do or there any option to report it somewhere that they are sending abuse mails with no reason?
 Thank you!

 I hope someone can help me here with this issue I can't wrap my head araound any more.
 The problem is basically:
 Some domain users can enter admin-credentials when asked for but are stuck on a blackish screen after that. It stays for several minutes until it times out and nothing happens after that.
 Logging off or shutting down doesn't work as well for those users. It stays at the screen "shutting down" or "logging off".
 Gpupdate fails after several minutes with a timeout for userpolicy. There are no errors for this in eventlog.
 When logged in with a different user, everything works just fine and some users don't have the same problems on all their pcs, however some got a new pc and the issues came back. 
 I'm running AD on-prem, the users don't have much in common except being domain-users. 
 Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

 I try to wrap my head around why and how the default language for a new Mailbox is influenced. My guess is, it's probably not necessary to change the language manually every time a mailbox was created automatically. 
 Right now, we log into the usermailbox via web and set the language manually. Powershell via the set-mailboxfolderregionalconfiguration cmdlet is also an option. But I can't find a way to set, e.g. a policy for it or a tenant wide default setting. 
 Anyone here already figured it out, or am I hunting ghosts here?

 So we run both Nessus and M365 Defender scans across or estate. Nessus has identified a few machines runing an app which includes Log4J-1.2.8.jar. However the supplier states their system is not vulnerable to attack. My assumption with this is that the app doesn't use it in the live environment and maybe it was used during development for logging... but why include it in the deployment??? 
 Anyway... 
 My understanding was that if it exists on a device it has the potential to be exploited. Is this understanding correct? 
 I have our App Support asking the suppliers if it is not used, whether we can remove it without issue / voiding warranty / support. 
 Just after some clarity as to vulnerability really.

 In W11 if I open certain application, i can't use other applications/functions like using my browser. I can scroll in my browser but I can't type, open a new tab or even click on a page. The focus is fully on that application. If i minize the application, i can once again use my browser (or file explorer etc.). This is on my home pc. I learned to live with it since there is a workaround. Since I couldn't find a fix i thought maybe it was a "feature" of W11 and stopped researching it. 
 Now i don't know when it happened but I'm now having the same issue on my work laptop which runs on W10. Once I open up PowerShell ISE, the focus gets locked on it and i can't perform any other actions, wether that is opening file explorer or just browsing the internet. I can scroll through whatever is open but that's it. 
 It isn't focus mode (which seems to do something entirely else) and this is really disturbing my ability to perform my work. If i Google Windows locks browser, i get shit about locked screen sigh...
 What in god's name is going on here? Why are certain applications getting "on top", stealing focus and Ms/kb input? Any suggestions are welcome!
 Edit: Ctrl+spacebar doesn't fix it btw.

 Due to this Microsoft Article the client was deprecated in june 2022. But here it says, thats bundled with the SQL Server version.
 I have some "older" SQL Server like 2012 and 2014 where ne native client was the latest. But with a new installed SQL 2019 the client was installed. SSMS 19 is installed too. 
 I cannot uninstall the client via the system, because it tells me that some things could broken. 
 So, how do you solve this problem? Its just from an admin perspective not from a dev.

ansible ad hoc copy the file /etc/ohgawd.key from remote server called tsrv01 present in inventory file tsrvs to local machine's temp director. the ansible user is bob and is present on both machines using ssh keys with passwordless sudo on the target machine.
  
The result:
 ansible tsrv01 -i tsrvs -m copy -a "src=/etc/ohgawd.key dest=/tmp" --user=bob --private-key=/path/to/ssh/key --become --become-user=root --ask-become-pass --extra-vars 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3' --connection=ssh

 ansible tsrv01 -m fetch -a 'src=/etc/ohgawd.key dest=/tmp/ohgawd.key' -i tsrvs -b 
 This is a pretty simple task. in this case the process of making the chatgpt ad hoc command work is a hassle. tried coaxing it towards what I wanted but without any better results. And it seems spending a lot of time doing that is a waste compared to just doing it properly yourself. Or googling. 
 So, you still gotta know a little something about what you're doing.

Before adjusting the tomcat config itself (Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1, disable weak ciphers etc.) I would like to allign the Tomcat Versions and update them to version 9.0.73. 
 I found a couple of different ways how to do this minor update and would like to receive your feedback.
 First Approach Idea: 
  
Backup current configuration
 Remove the complete tomcat installation
 Install the new version from scratch
 Adjust configs like server.xml, web.xml etc.
 Copy from backup the relevant webapps / certificates etc.
  
Second Approach idea:
  
Backup current configuration
 Replace only the files inside the folders /bin and /lib folders
 Don't touch the rest of the config .xml Files
  
I found various diffrent approaches online from diffrent vendors and now i am litle bit uncertain how the "correct" approach would look like.

 I'm working with a network that has multiple VRFs which communicate with each other. We're considering doing some BGP aggregation.
 My question is, when we're doing BGP aggregation in this type of scenario, should we be aggregating closer to the source network? Or is there no real best practice or recommendation for where to aggregate?
 To provide some context, we have two VRFs - VRF A and VRF B - that are leaking together, and we want to aggregate some subnets from VRF A to some peer on VRF B.
 Any insights or recommendations on the best way to approach this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 So we have 1 user complaining about slow wifi (for our guest wifi) and there are about 5 APs on this site. Slowness observed while surfing the web on phone/laptop while connected to wifi.
 He is in a remote site which doesn't have too many users and is connected via layer 3 Verizon epl back to our main site.
 He says he roams around say about 30-40 ft from his desk and it is still slow. Tried rebooting the AP that he was connected to (which I was able to see from the controller) which didn't help.
 His ethernet connection (Ethernet cable connected directly to laptop) works fine so I'm guessing it has to do with the APs themselves.
 What other troubleshooting steps can I look into to diagnose the cause?
 Probably have to look into the gui of the wlc I'm guessing.
 Also we upgraded the wlc from 8.1 to 8.3 about 2 weeks back and he says the wifi has been working slow ever since then.
 Right now we have only 1 wlc functioning in standalone which used to be 2 wlcs in an active standby pair before the upgrade as we ran into some complications. Will attempt to upgrade the other wlc tomorrow with Cisco support and get them back to the active standby cluster setup as it was originally. Don't think the wlc being in standalone could be causing any issues though as we have 40 other APs (also upgraded to 8.3) and have no issues with those in terms of speed of browsing for clients, etc.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE: The issue turned out to be FEC (Forward Error Correction). Setting it to off on the FS switch solved the issue.
 Devices involved: MikroTik ccr2216-1g-12xs-2xq router + FS.com N8560-48BC switch
 Cables:
  
FS.com S28-PC01 (Cisco coded)
 
FS.com S28-PC02 (Cisco coded)
 
Mikrotik XS+DA0001
 
Unspecified DAC from our DC
 
FS.com SFPP-PC02 (Cisco coded)
 
 Issue:
 Both the MikroTik and the FS.com switch consistently see the transceivers for each DAC cable. 
 However, no link is ever established. When a connection is made in loopback (from router to router or switch to switch) with these same cables, they seem to come up just fine, so cable compatibility should be okay, but it's like the FS switch or the MikroTik just don't care that they should be connecting.
 Tried the following:
  
Setting negotiation to off on both sides + setting duplex and speed manually
 Leaving negotiation on and everything negotiating
 Forcing transceiver type on the FS switch transceiver 25GBASE-COPPER
 Rebooting the switch at various points, rebooting the router at various points
 Upgrading the MikroTik firmware
 (TODO) Upgrade the firmware on the FS switch
 All the different cables specified
 Setting VLANs on both sides

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/sysadmin!
 Just wanted to send a heads up about potential post-exploitation activity sourcing from 3CX Phone System’s desktop application due to automated updates that was reported by CrowdStrike through Reddit, Inc. 
 The original post can be seen here:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/125r3uu/20230329_situational_awareness_crowdstrike/
 Our SOC has observed indicators of SentinelOne quarantining 3CXDesktopApp.exe and Update.exe on March 22nd and will continue to track this as the situation develops further.
 While our SOC has observed quarantines, the good news is that Blackpoint has found no evidence of further malicious activity, successful beacons or post-exploitation commands observed.
 How to Mitigate: 
 - Uninstall 3CX from all machines until the situation is resolved 
 - If uninstalling is not a viable option, then ensure the 3CX is a version prior to 18.12.4xx for Windows and 18.11.X for Mac. 
 - In addition, check firewall records for callouts to the domains in the above report by CrowdStrike

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m asking because I’ve noticed a recurring issue with all US-based ISPs periodically losing all DNS information for an entire TLD, and all domains on that TLD (including mine) appear to vanish and go offline. 
 Ping, nsloookup, and dig can’t resolve the domain to an IP. The entire TLD is gone, while all other domains remain online. 
 Multiple third-party products, tools, and services confirm that the entire TLD ceases to exist for several hours at a time, which is very puzzling. Many alerts and notifications from our vendors arrive when this happens. 
 I’ve reached out to ICANN for some information, but they are apparently not an authority for this TLD (it’s one of the newer ones that’s country-specific). 
 The registry for the domain says there’s no issue, but they aren’t testing through any US-based ISPs. My offshore team can still access our infrastructure, while myself and all our US-based customers cannot. 
 The registry’s website is also offline to all US-based traffic when this happens, since it uses the same TLD (*.et). Sites like downforeveryoneorjustme.com show their site as down when this happens. 
 Very strange. Not sure where to look for answers. Thanks!
 Update: I’m realizing that troubleshooting this issue will require more experienced folks in networking. Terms like Bogon Routes, Looking Glass, ASN, IANA, and others mentioned here are new to me. If you’re particularly experienced in this space and are available for some consulting, or on-call emergency troubleshooting next time it happens, please send me a DM. I’d like to assemble a small group that can help get to the bottom of this US-only ISP / TLD issue. Many thanks to everyone that’s commented here.

 Now that I look at the blueprints of the specialization exams I see a huge overlap with DEVCOR. Some of them lean towards domain-specific Cisco products (NSO for SP, UCI for DC, etc) but the 300-910 DEVOPS seems to be a subset of DEVCOR, maybe with a bit more of Kubernetes (well, probably, but anyway).
 Am I underestimating the exams (and especially 300-910 DEVOPS) or are they really just meme exams to milk us for $300?

 we are in the process of evaluating Elasticflow. im setting up a vm and sending netflow v9 data to the elasticflow vm. i dont know too much about elasticflow but so far im liking it. 
 ​
 elastic flow base their prices on flows per second. now my question is where does everyone usually enable netflow with this in mind? should i enable netflow only on our core routers? should i do it also on user access switches as well? 
 ​
 i was thinking to get the best price maybe to only enable netflow on our core routers and not so much on the access switches. im sorry that this is a very vague question im still in the process of configuring it. 
 ​
 we are a cisco shop with ftds and routers internally. and if anyone has any opinions or tips on elasticflow and best practices on it i would appreciate it

 thank you!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in a couple of small ISPs and in this time have noticed two main types of networks using L3 switches:
  
All switches are in the same L2 network and are usually all in the same subnet.
 
Every switch has a specific /32 IP address on its loopback interface and every connection between these switches uses a /30 prefix for PTP on a specific VLAN.
 
 I've seen both of these scenarios using OSPF and don't know if the latter is a requirement for some kind of protocol, like MPLS. I've seen ISPs move from the first to the second scenario, but don't know why or even if this is good behavior.
 I'd assume that the latter would be more CPU intensive on the hardware and maybe add a disregardful amount of latency to the network, but what are the benefits?

 Question about Virtual Stackwise. Currently we have a single Core Switch that is running on the network. Trying to implement a secondary Core Switch to use as the Virtual Stackwise for redundancy. Primary Switch has all the configurations and I have implemented the stackwise configurations on it. On the Secondary Switch, I have implemented the stackwise-virtual and domain, SVL (learned that this is not needed in the Secondary Switch. Deleted them), and DAD link. The question is, will the Secondary Switch sync configurations that are on the Primary Switch?
 ​
 Also, how does the interface numbering work? We got 40 port CAT 9500s. Will Primary be numbered int range ten1/0/1 - 40 and secondary switch int range ten2/0/1 - 40?

 My organization is slowly moving to a new headquarters site over the next few years, which of course will entail setting up a new core. We have a temporary 3750 stack there now as we haven't gotten all of our equipment yet. The site is a six-story building (not including basement, where the core resides). IDF closets on each floor with layer 2 switches, 12 strands of fiber ran between each floor and the basement. Our current headquarters core is a chassis switch (Cat 4507), with port-channels to other buildings for layer 2 redundancy.
 I've read a bunch of posts here and elsewhere about best practice for core redundancy, and it seems like stacking (virtual stackwise in my case, as these will be 9500s) is generally considered to be less favorable to having separate management planes. What I haven't quite been able to nail down is what the right solution is to accommodate that is. I've been looking at VRRP, HSRP, and GLBP. For those with experience with any of those, which would you recommend and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 We‘re currently deploying fortiswitches at our campus and keep on getting issues with these switches. First we swapped our core layer to 1048Es. First burden was to add 4 switches to a MLAG. Its restricted to 2 switches. Then there was an issue with connecting both MlAG pair with each other. It created a loop, even tho configured as stated in their documentary and made everything to shit down. 
 Connecting distribution layer was a mess to. It looped again due to a bug with STP. Since you have no real centralized management, we had to troubleshoot on Firewall GUI, CLI and Switch CLI. You can completely forget about the Fortimanager integration. 
 Accsess layee integration got its own bugs. Since were running a split vendor environment right now, we had problems connecting the switches to the 1048Es 10gig lwl ports. Had to do some config adjustments on the old switches too. 
 Configuring these switches is verry „interesting“ too as Im used to CLI only. The CLI itself is nothing compared to Ciscos or Junipers. Though I like there firewall configuration, the switch controller GUI seems to be buggy as well. Some menues doesnt show all options so you have to increase window size to actually view everything. The topology view is buggy too as you cant even scroll in on large deployments. 
 Overall it has not been a pleasure dealing with this devices. Since we have over 2000 switches in general, I dont think this will be funny times. 
 Do you also have fortiswitches on your campus/dc and what is your opinion about them?

What technologies or protocols are they using for their underlay network that provides the option for massive scaling? How are they isolating customer networks from one another? What sort of overlay technology could they use?
 I came across some readings of BGP in the Data Center, I'm pretty sure this may answer my first question. I find this very intriguing as I've never thought of BGP being used outside of ISPs. 
 I'm generally curious on the different design options being used. I tried searching for some info on AWS underlying architecture for the DC but it seems they don't really put that info out there. Would love to hear from anyone in r/networking who has dabbled into this area.

In the event someone is termed, for whatever reason, I would like the ability to remotely remove emails without wiping the entire device. We are using Exchange for email.

 It seems to work decently and we haven't heard anything about FPs.
 However, we also have Barracuda devices on-prem and it seems they are pretty much useless at this point. There's no way to add a "score" to a hit on an RBL like I can in SpamAssassin, nor can I install custom modules that utilize stuff like SpamHaus's HBL.
 Barracuda has left these devices out to die, seemingly. There are no updates forthcoming since a couple of years, according to my co-worker.
 A while ago, I looked at Titan and it was basically the same as Barracuda.
 It seems, nobody wants to develop mail-screening for on-prem anymore. But what's the point of SSL and end-to-end encryption, if your mail goes through a 3rd-party first anyway?

Is this some sort of synchronisation pulse and is there any way to supress this via programming adapters etc?
 The module is "CWDM-SFP1G-ZX" from FS and the board is the "SFP experimenter board v2 kit" from sysmocom.

 We have our UPSs, of course, and we have a generator, but the generator is old doesnt always fire. Facilities has worked on it, and they can usually get it up in running in 20 minutes or less, which is fine for getting the offices working but not adequate for keeping everything from going down. We are getting ready to start major construction, so that will mean periodic power outages, and I have been told "Just fix it". Im working to compel facilities to replace the generator, but I want to pursue a second solution as well.

 Attached on each:
 6x Aruba Instant On AP25
 All Switches will be connected Redundant to either (depending on deliverablitly) via 1Gig
 3x 6300F Aruba CX (due to need of SFP+ Interfaces)
 or
 2x 6300M with 24 SFP+ Interfaces (Then Link to Access will be 10Gig.)
 Aruba CX Stack will be VSX. 
 All VLAN's (About 6) will be trunked to a Sophos UTM which will be doing Inter VLAN Routing.
 ​
 Is there something I can / need to improve ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was informed that I could talk to the Cisco sales rep for quotes. I am planning to convert my current collapsed core into spine leaf architecture. My network is not that big. It is basically 1 production and the rest are tenant networks. The traffic is 95% east west and the remaining 5% is north south is when we are doing a test with other organization. We do a lot of BUM traffic and multicast. We have some instances that some tenants will run some test between them. We also do a lot of data transfer to our storage from 500GB to some TB. We have some compute nodes to process the data that got transferred.
 About a firewall, I am leaning towards Palo Alto. I have worked with PAN in the past and really liked it. 
 Anyways, I am thinking two the Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX for the spines and leaf switches. Is the 93180YC-FX good candidate for spine?
 I would like to use VRF-lite to each tenant/lab. We currently have 8 tenants and growing. At the moment, I am still wrapping my head around how I can get the two tenants to connect to each other via L3VNI. What is the typical way of doing this?
 About the firewall, I am still trying to figure out the best place to deploy it. Reading some Spine leaf docs, it seems the firewall is usually located at the border leaf. And the Upstream network is on a VRF-lite. Some says use the firewall to route between tenants. The global table seems to be just the fabric. Am I understanding this correctly?
 I would like to use my C9300 as an access switches and use VRRP between the local leaf switches. Is this even a valid design in the real world?
 Does the leaf need to be in vPC if I were to do VRRP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of a rant, but I'm just wondering: I work for a small company with 700 users and 15 offices. We have 65 VMs (VMware environment) spread across multiple locations, Cisco switches, Fortigate firewalls and APs, UPSs, EMC SANs, Dell servers, Veeam Backup, Wasabi, SharePoint, OneDrive, O365 Mail (hybrid), Power BI, and 100 iPads (with a subpar MDM). The list could go on and on, and my point here is that we have only one IT director, one system administrator/network administrator/security person (me), and three helpdesk folks. One of the helpdesk people is amazing, but the other two just float by.
 My question is this: I've been here for 8 years, and I've noticed that we get zero training, everything is a dumpster fire that needs to be put out, management doesn't listen to important security changes that need to be made, and there are no policies in place, such as an email policy, internet policy, BYOD policy, etc. (I have sent all of these to management and HR for approval, but they just don't write back.) The culture here, as in the people, is great; I've never worked with such an array of awesome people. However, they don't seem to care about any structure or advancement of learning of any kind. I just constantly feel behind the eight ball and can never get caught up to even have time for training. 
 Has anyone else's workplace been like this? If so, what did you do to change it?

 I need to decide to upgrade from older Cisco 2900 switches and ruckus wifi to new hardware. Its not much devices, 1 server rack with core switch and office floor switches + wlan APs. I mainly use switching and 802.1x in switches, no routing no complex functionality. Wireless setup is simple too + couple of RADIUS auths.
 I like cisco stability and ruckus wifi. I do not like cisco's lack of telemetry compared to what Arista seems to be able to offer (cloudvision)
 I do not have Arista or Extreme experience, but Arista seems to be highly praised in networking community.
 I am not sure about Arista wireless. Mojo/CUE?
 Also I am not sure Arista's lack of NAC or radius authentication of devices over wireless or LAN (correct if I am mistaken).
 I have some level of local IT partners demos done to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently getting ready for moving into a new building and I need a sanity check on my options. I'll preface this with I'm in the UK and getting stock of anything has been a nightmare since Brexit!
 New building is a training facility/office space with about ~300 data points across 2 floors. On average there's only about 70 users on site, but it peaks to ~350 with guests etc.
 I've been in talks with Aruba for a while, and they've finally given me their solution, which is 2x CX6300M and 6x CX6100 which is coming in at over £100K MSRP. Originally they spec'd CX6400 at almost £220K!
 Their issue is the lead time is 36 Weeks at best for the 6300, and 15 Weeks for the 6100.
 The second option is to go UniFi, I've already got an extensive UniFi wireless system already and we're sticking with Unifi for the wireless in the new building. I'll probably still stick with an Aruba 2930 at the core acting as the layer 3 router - I'm also looking at firewall options between Sonicwall and rolling my own PFSense on HPE server hardware for layer3 routing.
 The UniFi solution of 2x USW-Enterprise-48 and 6x USW-Pro-48-PoE is almost 1/5th the cost at less then £20K, obviously it lacks a lot of the features of the Aruba, and their Layer 3 stuff is laughably bad.But at 1/5th the cost, and being able to get it with only 1 weeks lead time, is this a good option or am I crazy?
 For the money I could by a cold spare of every Unifi switch and still be half the cost of the Aruba option.

 A nice bonus would be if I could generate a portal with a list of sessions and browse the web for computers outside the organization. Do you know of such a tool that you can recommend?

 We are running Azure Virtual Desktop POC, and we do not have a static IP assigned to the hosts. We also use Cisco Umbrella as our proxy for users, and I would like to update the network address of the Virtual Desktops in Umbrella.
 Cisco suggest using either the Dynamic update tool, or an API.
 We can't log in to the OpenDNS dynamic update tool as we use SAML authentication, so Cisco support have suggested using the API. 
 Which is all good and well - but the API is a shell command - and I'm not sure how I can run this on a windows server as scheduled task, and ideally do not want to setup the Linux subsystem in windows on the Azure Virtual Desktops. 
 Details of the API commands are here - https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cloud-security/#!dynamic-network-update-getting-started/response-codes 
 The command they have suggested in Shell is 
 curl -i -X PUT 'https://updates.opendns.com/nic/update?hostname=<Umbrella network name>' \ -H 'Authorization: Basic %YourEncodedUsernamePassword%' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

 I am in a situation that I am not really sure how to face I've never got trough all the steps of a selection process for rejecting the offer but this time i think i must. They explained me the position twice and it sound for me like the position i'm in now as deployment of software technician, but didn't detailed the work schedule and the location of the position until the last interview. Then yesterday they confirmed me that they want me for the position. They offer 6.000€ more per year than my current wage working usually on remote but required to work occasionally to a warehouse that is an hour away in by train and another 15 min walking from the station, and doesn't seem to be a comfortable place to work in, besides they haven't confirmed if would be working on shifts and weekends which would be the worst. 
 I'm not sure how to explain that the position would mean a worse quality of life for me and reject it but without losing face with the corporation which i would like be to work with in the future, or just ghosting them and saving the effort. 
 Thank you for reading, and excuse me for any grammar mistakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am browsing this subreddit almost daily and I would like to suggest a new type of post. This will have engineers giving their opinions about a (fairly) new technology that they have actually implemented and their opinion.
 An example of a valid post will be:
 - We currently have Cisco DNA Center, and backing up this product is horrible (among everything else). You can select a backup destination, an NFS mount, but it does not have the option to "keep x amount of backups" or "keep the last X backups". Upon researching, I have found a bash script written by a Cisco engineer where you put it on the NFS server (its a bash script), deleting backups older than X amount of days. I realized that if backup was failing for a couple of weeks in a row and I was on holiday or forgot to check the backups on a daily basis, that script would delete all backups. It is such a bad design.
 ​
 Examples of bad posts are:
 - Vendor X has announced technology Y. This is a marketing/sales post where it was not a tested feature.
 - I have reused my old Cisco 2950s for OoB management. This is an old way of doing things with an even older technology.

 I literally only have these 9 tablets, and dont really want to pay for software just to do that
 Does anyone know of a free software, or a way to bypass it entirely?
 Specifically what i need, is for these tablets to only be able to access a specific browser url, and to default to that url after a specific time of inactivity. I also need to be able to have the screens on permanently.
 If anyone else has any other good ideas, im open to options.

 I'm looking for someone that has a bit of Fibre Channel/MDS experience to ask about some best practice stuff.
 I've been tasked with replacing our old Nexus FC switch(s). we have a pair of them with each server/storage with duel HBA's into each switch. I'll be using Cisco MDS 9148T's to replace the Nexus box's.
 The part that has thrown me, is although there is a port-channel trunk setup between the switches they have different vsans on each switch (trunk only allows their vlan so the neighbour switch will drop)... this would technically still work but i cant help but think it isnt best practice? 
 i would have thought you have both switches configured with the same vsan and a trunk between them? 
 If anyone has any examples of best practice for this senario it would be much appricated. 
 TL:DR - How should i configure 2 resilient FC switches with each server/storage having a connection to both switches.
 Thanks!

 I am using a Logi mouse and a Logi keyboard, both are bluetooth/wireless. I have a M1 MacBook Pro which can only connect to 1 external display. I am likely buying a new X1 Carbon which can connect to 2 external displays.
 Ideally I can have 4 screens on my desk: the 2 laptops and 2 external displays. This means one of the two external displays will be shared by both laptops. How can I switch it to read from one laptop and to the other laptop? This also means I will need a switch for the mouse and keyboard too. What is the best way to do this with the least amount of wires and least number of steps in daily operation?
 Additional information for use case: the M1 Macbook Pro will likely be used as a desktop while the X1 Carbon will often be unplugged and taken out as a laptop and plugged back in again when home.

All of our printers have been in place for almost 10 years, I am taking this opportunity to hopefully standardize and improve the naming convention. If I can get examples of current names and why they are named that way I would greatly appreciate it.
 Edit 1: to provide an example of what we are doing, the printer refresh walkthrough revealed 324 printers, we have managed to reduce that down to 300. There are departments that have a single location like one suite and is somewhat simple, there are others that have multiple locations throughout the city. We currently have the implementation of the Follow-me printer and have many staff that use it as was suggested in the comments. One example I can provide is the Police Department and the many building they occupy and the multiple units within their headquarters, for instance I’ll make a couple up just for example: PD-224MFP01 or FIN-MFP02, for the first example Police Department/building/Multi-Function Printer/1st out of 2 printers. The next is simply Finance/Multi-Function printer/2nd out of two.

 I need to change the subnet of a particular Vlan from /24 to /23 as we are running out of IP addresses for that Vlan. If I understand this correctly, I just need to change the scope on DHCP server, change the L3 vlan ip to new subnet mask, check the routing and change FW policies to include the new IP addresses for communication.
 Is there any other step I should add or If I am missing something?
 Thanks in advance.

 Anyway I'm not an infrastructure expert by any means and seek the help of the Sysadmin community before I go and spend some money.
 2 sites. Current infrastructure
 2 x hosts on primary site
  
Files server / DC / Print server (plan to split these)
 2nd DC
 SQL server
 ERP app server
 WMS app server
 Unifi controller for AP's
 Win10 vm
 Data for Sage 50 Accounts and Payroll
 Archive server for Solid Edge cad files.
  
1 x host on secondary site
  
DC / Print
 Unifi controller vm for AP's
  
Nothing drastic. All in hyper-v. Approx 100 endpoints.
 Dell or HPE?
 SSD MSA / SAN or SSD in host.
 VMWare or Hyper-V?
 MS Server licences - Datacentre licences for mobility over Standard
 Initial RFI and RFQ process is 3 x Dell servers, 1 x PowerVault ME5 , VMware , Veeam, MS DC licence for 68 cores. 5 year Pro Support 4hr mission crit, 3 year Prod support for VMware = £120,000 . Is that on the money?

 I started a small On prem exchange to O365 migration ( 20 users ) last Monday with the goal of a Friday cutover 
 We have been unable to get step one the destination verififcation to complete. Many support emails with repetitive circular responses. Support didnt read previous notes or look at screenshots proving impersonation was in place. Just kept sending the same 3 or 4 answers to various changing verification failures. 
 I begged for a phone call or to be escalated. Now that Ive missed 2 cutover appts and burned LOTS of time that I cant ( or wont ) bill the customer. I asked for a refund so I could try another tool.
 Now they offer to escalate and send this along 
 "This error comes up regardless of whether the tenant has a secret key or not. It's a new error that we have very limited information about. This has been escalated and our dev team is working on a permanent solution. Meanwhile, what we have so far is this - Most Common Errors Encountered in MigrationWiz while using Modern Authentication for EWS in Exchange Online."
 the link is the same link they have sent at least 3 times before, Ive replied with screenshots proving that Ive done those things. And worse, they admit its an issue they cant figure out, but are still willing to send that same link to further waste my time. 
 Oh and they ignore the refund request
 At this point I would pause using BitTitan for migrations with O365 as the end point...
 Not sure if my bank will let me reverse the CC charge ...

 On the Switch we have 2 specific VLAN's that utilize like 5 Ports a piece. 
 ISP 1 Equipment Plugs into Port 1 Which is VLAN 4... Ports 2, 3,4, 5 are also VLAN 4.
 So, Port 1 pulls ISP 1 Connection to it.. And then blankets ports 2, 3, 4, 5 with that ISP Connection.
 ISP 2 Equipment plugs int Port 6 Which is VLAN 9... Ports 7, 8, 9, 10 are also VLAN 9.

 The other 12 VPC's are currently interconnected via VPC Peering. 
 This new VPC will be one which hosts instances that mange products in the other VPC's, so think development, dev OPs, etc. 
 Now, using a transit gateway in this new VPC would be easy to route traffic in and out of VPC. But my question now is with the other VPC's.
 I understand I'd have to connect VPC(13)'s transit gateway with a transit gateway populated in the other 12 VPCs, but would this transit gateway overwrite the prior legacy VPC Peerings? 
 TL'DR
 building new VPC that needs to connect to 12 other VPC's. 
 the 12 vpc's connect to each other via peering.
 want to leverage transit gateway on VPC 13.
 will doing transit gateway for VPC 13 to the other 12 VPC's break the original 12 VPCs' peering?
 Can i use transit gateway for VPC 13 to other 12, but keep peering within original 12?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am currently working on deploying a second core switch to be in sync with our current live core switch on the network. I am doing this so that our network can have redundancy and decided to go with Virtual Stackwise technology. I think I have configured the switches correctly but they are not synching. Right now due to physical limits between our locations, only one of the SVL can be connected. I was thinking that the DAD link and the second SVL interface can wait until we have more fiber panels put into our buildings (it will be soon). Will not having the DAD link connection up cause the two switches to not sync? Also, do you need to configure the second core switch to have configurations or just applying the stackwise configuration will have it pull configs from the original switch?
 ​
 These are the configs I implemented into the two switches. Currently, only interface 1/0/39 from each switch are physically connected to one another.
 Core Switch 1 Config:
 stackwise-virtual
 domain 101
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
 description Link_To_MIL-B80-CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/39
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/40
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW2
 ​
 Core Switch 2 Config
 stackwise-virtual
 domain 101
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
 description Link_To_MIL-B80-CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/39
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW1
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/40
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW1
 ​
 Edit: doing 'show switch' on CoreSW1 shows that it's the only device. On CoreSW2, it shows itself as switch 2 and it's active (I configured it to be switch 2) and Switch 1 is provisioning (on this switch there is no MAC address or any info.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 So as the title says, I have been at this job for one year and after six months of working here my manager quit, leaving me as the sole IT person for the company. I hit my one year mark and begged for a year review since I had been doing all the IT on my own for six months with it seeming like they were never going to replace him.
 They decided to promote me to IT Manager and gave me a 20% raise! 
 But now the imposter syndrome is setting in, with this newly appointed title I'm just not too sure where to start.
 For context, this is a small post house for a media entertainment company, we only have 10 full time employee's, but we do have a rotating staff of about 20 artists and producers.
 Can any IT management or people in similar positions give me some advice on steering this ship smoothly?
 I started IT in 2020 as helpdesk for about a year then moved to jr sysadmin, so I feel like I'm not qualified, however I'm very grateful and excited for this opportunity and want to do my best. 
 Luckily there is a decent amount of down time, so if anyone has any material I should read or watch, I'd love the recommendations.
 Thanks!

 Marketing (2 person department) wants to purchase a mac for one of their users - I've been asked about how I could integrate it into our environment, would it be difficult etc.
 I'm pretty surface level familiar with how to do it with ABM, jamf etc. But I am curious if all of this effort would be worth it for 1-2 macs at most..

 My company manages some mid sized business network and we filled out the entire places with EnGenius APs. We got great coverage and all was decent, but throughout time I am noticing that they aren’t that great. They will randomly lock up (still can ping but gui not working nor can anyone connect) so we have to reboot. Lately it seems like they like to disconnect frequently, especially for iPads. It’s so frustrating. Does anyone have any suggestions for a different AP for a mid sized business? I believe we have 20 AP here. Thanks all!

 I have a Juniper EX9208 core switch and using OSPF.
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.4
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.5
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.16 passive
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.77 passive

 vrrp-group 50 {
 virtual-address 10.1.50.1;
 priority 150;
 preempt;
 accept-data;
 }
 }
 }
 }
 It is straightforward where I have two interfaces active and doing neighborship and the rest are passive interfaces to advertise their subnets.
 I received a request to block one of the passive-interface (irb.16 / 10.10.10.0/24 ) subnet from being advertised to the neighbor that is forming on (irb.5). I can not remove the passive command from interface irb.16 since it will stop being advertised to both neighbors and not our goal.
 What is the easiest way to block this subnet (10.10.10.0/24) where I can apply it to the neighbor on irb.5 only?

 Am I supposed to know fire stop code or the distance between my network cables and electrical cables. 
 At most the direction I can think of is a 48ru cabinet to support (size/depth of our switches) and space for the patch panels. 
 Our shop also requires a specific cable manufacturer for copper, so I include that and that the cables have to pass testing (poe, continuity and grounding), 
 cable trays to be installed hanging from the ceiling (but am I supposed to specify the size of a j hook or that it must be bolted and secure?)
 Bundles must be secured with velcro.
 Service loop for 1m at each end of termination.
 Cables shouldn't be more than 95m etc.
 I would love a suggestion into reading material or how I can keep up with the requirements for physical cabling. We have had many phases of construction and most of this was handled by consultants and I was never privy to the details, but now the PMs are asking me for this info and I'm a bit lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm working on a project where I need to connect a workstation in one town to a workstation in a different town. I am creating the project completely virtually (in Microsoft Hyper-V), with servers acting as routers.
 For each network, I've created a server, switch and client that can communicate with each other, but I can't seem to get them to communicate between networks. As far as I know, the only tools I can use in the scenario are Windows based, so I've been trying to use RRAS, but haven't had any luck. I don't need to worry about an internet connection at all, so I've just been attempting a static route between the servers/routers.
 I've created this diagram (https://imgur.com/a/6D4VvNZ - sorry for poor quality). I basically need a client (192.168.1.1) to talk to another client (192.168.2.1). They can both talk to their servers (192.168.1.254 / 192.168.2.254) but I can't get the servers to talk to eachother. I have two NICS on each server/router, one with the private IP address and one with the public IP address (173.15.15.x/30).
 Has anyone got any ideas where I might be doing wrong?
 Thanks in advance

 When Deploy-Application.exe is clicked, the UAC prompts immediately, but afterward there is roughly a 20 second delay before the Welcome message prompts wherein the user is directed to close applications and proceed.

 Has anyway else experienced this, and know of a workaround?
 Even if I can have a preceding "Please wait" message appear, that would work fine as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been following other posts on increased false positive spam that started in March and I thought I'd share the cause for us. It was a link to our website in our email signature. The link was causing false positives for both outbound to other Microsoft tenants, and then inbound back to us. 
 In testing I could send an email containing only: https://ourdomain.com
 and it would be blocked.
 Then I'd send one with only: https://0urd0ma1n.com (or any other domain)
 and it would come right through.
 I have no idea why this is the case yet, it's a small typical website that hasn't been hacked in any way.

I haven't gotten the chance to physically touch them because they are installed in the ceiling BUT I am wondering if there is a software to discover all the WAPs and show me their IP address so I can access them. I have 0 info from the previous owners of this equipment, and I'm not super Cisco savvy, but if I can save a few grand by using these instead of replacing them, I'm willing to suffer a bit LOL.

Am I correct in thinking this would be massive overkill as we only have about 30 FTEs which are all US based - and work remote. My plan was provisioning company issued laptops loaded with an MDM and VPN to our FTEs, and VDIs for our contractors. 
 My question is in terms of headaches and pricing, wouldn't it be overkill to setup VDIs for everyone including FTE? Let me know as I do not have the most experience with VDIs company wide. As my last companies stuck to VDIs for contractors and company issued laptops for FTEs.

 I have an application that is made of up of several servers. 2 of the servers are just typical physical servers which are dual-nic'd and plugged into a pair of Nexus 9k switches. The rest of the environment is made up of virtual machines (ESXi 7.0.3 EPP w/ vCenter). The application calls for creating a SPAN port which will monitor traffic on the 2 physical servers and then to monitor that traffic on 2 virtual machines. I am not sure how to set this up? I am good in VMware, but more of a novice when it comes to Cisco networking (or really networking in general.) Is this possible and if so, how would I go about configuring this?

Last year I took a great paying job with a soul-less corporate machine and last week it came back to bite me as I was laid off at a fairly bad time to be laid off in this industry. Several other corporations in my area also laid off IT workers saturating the market. Now with the "recession" very few are hiring. I have applied to over 130 positions in LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, etc... in the past week but all I have heard back were head hunters and rejection letters. 
 I understand this is all part of the process and with my skillset I will find somewhere to land eventually, but its hard to keep my thoughts positive when the livelihood of my family are on the line. I am 4 years from paying off my house so I really do not want to move as my mortgage is 1/3 that of renting a 3 bedroom house just about anywhere in the country right now. This has lead me down the road of looking for Full Remote jobs, and let me tell you, they are crazy... 
 Advertised as Remote Work - (But you must live 30 minutes from our office, and come into the office 3 days a week), or you must live in the same state or you are immediately rejected. The rejection letters are nice to have, but each one is like adding another brick into the pile I am carrying into depression. 
 Then there are the fake jobs, the MSPs posing as real jobs, the scams, the head hunters that want you to scan your Drivers license and Social Security card to them... Yah right buddy. 
 ​
 I just want to work on someone's network making it better for a decent wage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm struggling to understand a concept our MSP has described as the reason staff using MRP and lightweight CAD programs are getting slow speed
 ​
 We have 1gb leased line symmetrical and an Sophos XG firewall running SSL VPN via the Sophos connect app. Before this, we had 300/100mb running off on old Draytek running L2TP. I can't say if MRP speeds are faster as we have only had the MRP system recently so it was just being implemented when the lines switched, , but the CAD stuff would work almost as quickly as if onsite
 ​
 Now, what takes milliseconds onsite is taking 20 or so seconds (this is just opening windows, no manipulation of the MRP/CAD files). Speaking to our MSP, they have said that it's due to the XG overhead on processing and routing the data. But I genuinely struggle to see it slowing speed down so much. Especially as the CAD stuff worked file over L2TP 
 If correctly configured, should we be seeing such delays over VPN? Onsite, everything is fine. The MRP and CAD software are hosted on SQL instances inside the network. I assumed there was traffic shaping of packet inspection turned on, but they say no
 ​
 Am I going mad??!?!

 My first guess was to make the announcement of the account migration, tell them the new format to figure out the username themselves (it's just firstname.lastname@domain) and send each an email with just the password without further context, so the information from one email is not enough. If I could encrypt the emails, it would be perfect, but I don't have the users public keys, as they are external. Though I have limited knowledge about email security, so please educate me. 
 Is there another way to get the passwords to the users securely or is it "good enough" to just send them separately? (Passwords need to be changed upon first login.)
 Thank you! 
 Disclaimer: I'm not the one responsible for the user migration, I just administrate the first service that wants to use the new AD.

 Basically I've been tasked with building a standalone media console, and I've been given some creative license to see exactly how much I can do with it. So far I've managed most of what I need to do without much issue, but I'm running into some confusion when it comes to the Custom Logon and embedded boot features on enterprise. To a degree this is a (multi-app) kiosk deployment, we don't want it especially obvious that it's running windows, so we want to suppress all the boot UI and windows logon UI with autologin to a locked down account, we have an application we want to use for the shell in place of explorer and lock down any breakout keys.
 I've made a few custom images and managed to sort out all the users and automated oobe features I need, now I'm moving onto the lockdown/embedded features portion. Pouring through the documentation on all the customlogon and embedded features from Microsoft, I'm not getting much of a direct answer as to when and how to deploy them, has anyone here worked with them before?
 Will these deploy properly if they're apart of an answer.xml configured in WSIM and installed from a custom image? Do they need to be configured in WinPE and built into the image from there? Can they be implemented to the OS from a provisioning package after initial deployment?
 Any help is greatly appreciated

 I'm having a big headache trying to work out how Microsoft licensing works for our Hyper-V implementation, especially with regard to SQL server.
 We have two independent Hyper-V clusters, each consisting of 3x 32-core single CPU hypervisors. Under normal operation our VMs are distributed between the two clusters. In a disaster scenario, we can manually bring up the VMs from one cluster onto the other.
 What I want to find out is:
  
Do I need Windows Server licenses for each guest VM, or just for the physical hypervisors?
 If I want to run a 4-vcpu SQL server VM on one cluster, what SQL license do I need to buy?
  
I asked the person inside our org who I consider to be the most Hyper-V expert and they said that they run physical SQL servers to avoid having to think about this...
 If anyone can help me figure it out I'd be most thankful. We already have enough server datacenter licenses with SA to cover our current VM load if it is one license per VM, but I'd like to know this for sure...
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past 2-3 months maybe longer we are noticing throughout a couple different companies that random users will launch their outlook or office in the morning and get the warning the office needs to repair.
 These devices stretch from brand new clean installs to ones that have been working for years. The weird thing is 1-2 reboots will "Fix" the issue and not ask for that anymore and they can continue on with their work.
 We are struggling as we can't locate anything to indicate what the problem is. If it's our security software that maybe blocking some communications. Is anyone else having the same issue? Google searches just bring up clean install or go through the repair process but we need a deeper dive.
 Thanks

 Our corporate network is configured to use Radius to authenticate devices connecting to the meraki network.
 We have a security group that all machines are a part of that allow authentication to the radius server.
 I have placed the macbook in this group and it is still unable to connect, it gets prompted for a username and password which it shouldn't do, it should automatically connect.
 I am new to networking macbooks in corporate environments, does anyone have any experience with this? Much appreciated.

Like after pmtu did the trick and the whole transfer is happening with pmtu 1500, how does such packets transfer over like jumbo frame network with 9000 mtu. Do router merge 6 1500 bytes packets into one 9000 packet or transfer them as 1500 bytes without any change ?
 Example network:
 Host 1 (1500 mtu) ------> eth0(1500mtu)---router---eth1(9000mtu) ----------- eth1(9000mtu)--router--(eth0 1500mtu) --------> host 2

I've got a use case where its a small operation (<50 users) with a full 365 system running business standard licenses for all users. 
 A few years ago I migrated our physical PBX system into the cloud, and it works just fine, but as the integration into the microsoft environment has gotten smoother, i'm investigating the option of moving from a third-party VOIP to skype for business. 
 I know microsoft has mostly good documentation, but i'm more interested if anyone here uses skype in a similar environment and what your feedback/experience has been. I'm asking here because I'm not interested in a sales pitch, i want to know what it's like from people who manage it or at the very least built/configured it into your organization.
 Thanks!

 We are planning a migration from Azure AD to Azure AD.
 In the source tenant the devices are Intune enrolled.
 In the lab, they were able to test the migration from tenant A to tenant B and that went well, including profiles.
 Intune is causing us problems. In the new tenant, the device is not rolled out in Intune (automatic enrollment activated). 
 Somehow we can't get the device out of Tenant A's Intune.
 Does anyone have experience with this and can give me tips?

 This worked as intended on a previous laptop, but it always seems to jump to 'ItIsntHere' when ran at login on this laptop. If I run the batch file manually it's working as intended, it just isn't working properly at login. I've tried added delays and that hasn't made a difference.
 I think the next step would be instead of checking for the NAS, checking if an ethernet connection is present or not - how would I set up a check for this?

replacing some older nodes
 Upgrading them all from 2012r2 to 2016 
  
The SAN disks are mounted on those nodes under 
  
C:\some_random_example_folder\
  
In the past (Win2012 days) we enabled bitlocker for the C: drives of all HyperV nodes - which never affected the mounted disc from the SAN.
 Now after switching from 2012 to 2016 and adding some new nodes - i am wondering: is that still the same with 2016? 
 Can i easily enable Bitlocker on those new nodes for C:\ without affecting the C:\some_random_example_folder\ mounted SAN disks?

 I´ve had some issues surrounding blocking the access to the admin console to the Dream Machine for a "Guest" VLAN.
 Following many guides and some common sense I have already blocked all access to other VLANs and to the IPs of the Gateway (Dream Machine). Additionally I have blocked all Port 22, 80 and 443 Connections to those IPs, but I can still access every single IP of the Dream Machine.
 ​
 Let´s say I have the
 - IoT VLAN 172.27.0.0/16
 - Default VLAN 172.16.0.0/16 
 Gateways are .1
 ​
 - Blocked access for clients in IoT to both Gateway IPs (for testing, since it does not work)
 - Blocked access for clients in IoT to ports 22, 80, 443 on both Gateway IPs
 ​
 I still get through to the admin console on the Dream Machine via every IP (172.27.0.1 & 172.16.0.1) whenever I try it from the IoT VLAN :(
 ​
 I would appreciate some help from anybody with some more experience :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, 2 years I used to work as a sysadmin ASSISTANT / SUPPORT but was never given proper training with server management so i lack alot of things. Fast forward today, i got accepted into an animating studio and they seem insistent i start asap by the end of the week. Thinking there was another member, it would be a hand in hand working environment, turns out i will be the sole sysadmin, no one to guide me around their system that im expected to know. My problem comes in when they said they'll be outsourcing their work from other countries by offering their pc as a service to them. They want to restrict them from copying data / files from their pc and would only allow them to use the graphic design software. I'm overwhelmed and i am not sure where to start. Any advise and tips would be greatly appreciated. 
 Also going to setup a home lab, so if you could advise with what softwares to use as well I'd be more than grateful!

 A user of mine suddenly gets the following error when trying to sign in to his domain account.
 the security database on the server does not have account for this workstation trust relationship
 The computer is domain joined but it does not exist anywhere in Active Directory on premises. In endpoint manager, on the other hand, I can find it just fine.
 What would you recommend as a good course of action? Should I remove the computer from the domain, for example, and add it again with the same computer name? If I do that will the user lose access to his domain profile? 
 Any kind of advice is greatly appreciated. Currently there's no senior in the company so I'm afraid to make a wrong move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 we've run into some strange behaviour at a client's DC. They recently moved to another office and finally made the choice to put some money into new server hardware, so we migrated their Srv2016 DC from an old ESXi to a new one. We didn't do a V2V (for various reasons) but chose to simply make a final Veeam backup and restored it as a new VM on the new host.
 At first boot the machine went into safemode (with AD repair) as we've expected. So we logged on, changed boot behaviour back to normal and rebooted several times to check if it's running correctly.
 Now, ~2 weeks later, users complained they didn't have access to a share anymore.
 So we've tried to login on the DC using our Domain Admin user and realised it isn't working. Screen says "user can't login due to account restrictions or maybe wrong characters in password - as a blank". That's nonsense. So we tried to login using the local admin account and there it says the account would have been deactivated (which isn't true either).
 Now we're stuck except for having remote powershell access (as system user) with our RMM software.
 I already used it for checking if some safemode has been activated (bcdedit) - which isn't the case.
 We also restarted the machine twice yesterday evening. Startup takes ages, but eventually it comes up to the same state.
 Anyone any idea?
 Cheers
 Jay

 Background: I have 2012R2 domain controllers (I know I need to update) with a Windows CA server that is issuing computer certs to client devices. Windows NPS runs 802.1x authentication using the computer certs for auth. None of the aforementioned services share an operating system; each service has their own VM(s).
 So, in the late 2010s when disabling SMBv1 was a priority because of then-recent vulnerabilities, I disabled SMBv1 on all my clients and servers, but apparently not my domain controllers. If I remember correctly, I tried disabling it on the DCs too, but that broke GPO, so I reverted. Back then, I wasn't running 802.1x, but the CA server was t…]]></summary>

 We are a smallish org (45 staff) and I'm preparing to move us to Windows 11 at some point next year, once one of our in house apps is updated from VB4 to .Net and will actually work. We use MDT for reimaging and deployment which happens a handful of times a year. No InTune, we don't do cloud.
 My question is... is there a fix that actually works either via Group Policy or preferable PowerShell as part of the task sequence to remove those damn shortcuts? I'm talking the consumer apps such as TikTok and Spotify.
 FWIW my test rig is on 11 Pro 22H2.
 Also big F**K YOU to Microsoft for including this consumer shit in 11 Pro in the first place!!

 We're on Google Workspace and we've looked into using Google Voice but while it allows for international outbound calling, it can only assign US and Canada based Google Voice numbers to our agents (ideally, each agent would have a local VoIP-assigned number for each their respective regions--US, Europe, India--that our internal users can call for IT help without having to make international calls.) We also looked in Zoom's 'Zoom Phone' and while it was better, they don't currently support India numbers.
 At this point, we've resigned to the fact there likely won't be one VoIP product to cover ever country we're looking for but we're now thinking maybe a global redirect service might be the way to go--one master toll-free number that will redirect to whoever is on-call.
 Anyone have any suggestions or products to avoid?

 So I think I've got the backend concept of VXLAN down now at about 95% understanding.
 The Overlay I see as the easier part, VTEP sends a BUM or unicast packet to the other VTEP with the right VNI in, from there, the VTEP that recieves it will look in its database for that VRF/VNI depending on if its a L2 or L3 VNI and then forward onto the correct VRF and end device
 The main confusion left is how different underlay routing combinations work and interact with eachother.
 So far, this is how I see it. And please either feel free to totally correct me or can you please verify if I'm right as well.
 For data plane flood and learn, it's multicast on the underlay, using a combination of OSPF (an IGP) to distribute the RP addresses everywhere, and multicast to send out the packets to the R…]]></summary>

When I say relatively simple, I mean, VMware server connected to core switch, connected to firewall, out to internet, nothing like VRRP or other tech.
 Windows Server IP: 172.16.1.10
 Server default route: 172.16.1.2
 Its Default Gateway: 172.16.1.2 (Core switch)
 Firewall: 172.16.1.1
  
Traceroute to 8.8.8.8
 1 172.16.1.2 (core switch)
 2 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 3 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to 9.9.9.9
 1 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 2 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to mail.google.com
 1 172.16.1.2 (core switch)
 2 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 3 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to 8.8.8.8 
 1 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 2 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Why would some trace's hit the core switch (default gateway), and some hit the firewall directly first? Again no other tech is in place... No VRRP, no routing protocol (OSPF, etc), Other than the physical server is connected to the core switch with LACP. 
 The core switch (router) only has one route, and that is its default route of throwing everything at the firewall

 Currently, we are facing an issue where the owner of the company has access to only one of the domains' admin credentials, which he can use to manage the account or manage some of the systems. However, there are two different domains, and we cannot access the second domain controller. Additionally, the infrastructure includes a mixture of Linux and Windows machines with various operating systems, but we only have access to about 10% of that infrastructure due to a lack of credentials.
 For Linux machines, I am planning on resetting the root credentials individually.
 Is there any way for us to gain access to the second domain controller? We have access to their VM host, but we are unable to log in to that particular OS. 
 Thank you in advance for your help.

 We have run up a new server 2019 host and are looking to transfer the RD connection Broker, RD Gateway, RD web and RD licensing server roles from the current server 2016 host. After doing some reading, we have found that transferring the RD connection broker role is usually accomplished by configuring a HA cluster, adding the new server to the cluster and then removing the old server. This requires a SQL database and seems like a bit of work. 
 We were wondering if it is possible to install the RD connection broker service on the new server 2019 host, create a new RDP deployment, and then add the existing session host into the new deployment? Would this cause a problem being that the session host is already a part of the old RD collection?
 I have done some reading online and can’t find a straight answer as to whether servers can be a part of multiple RDP collections at the same time or whether they need to be removed from the current collection before being added to the new one. 
 Any help would be appreciated.

 I'm looking for someone to point me in the right direction. I've been searching for a while now and can't find an explanation for what I'm seeing.
 I have two Cisco ASR-9904 routers. One of them is allowing me to implement OSPF configurations. The other one is not.
 See screenshots here.
 I'm not sure why one is allowing OSPF to be configured, but the other isn't. I'm not super experienced with IOS-XR, so sorry if I'm missing something obvious to a lot of you. As far as I know, there is no way to enable or disable features on IOS-XR, like how you can with NX-OS. They are both running the same licenses (no licenses). I did not originally set up the working one, so I'm not sure if anything special was done to get OSPF working. It was set up several years ago. I am however tasked with setting up this second ASR.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning/afternoon/evening !
 I'm trying to figure out a routing issue I'm having with an Adtran / NetVanta router.
 I must have had a big bowl of stupid for breakfast this morning, since I'm still kind of scratching my head as to the source of the problem.
 See attached image for a rough block diagram for the network. . .
 https://i.imgur.com/INbKpWO.jpg
 I have an overload rule set for VLAN3, with a traffic selector of 172.55.0.0 /22 to permit any.
 From the PC, I can ping the VLAN1 IP address on the Adtran, at 172.55.0.222.
 I can also ping a few of the print servers on the 172.55.x.x subnet.
 I can't ping the 172.55.1.1 gateway, or the 172.55.0.200 switch.
 Nor can I reach any of the 172.55.x.x devices via http or telnet, including the ping-able print server devices.
 PCs attached to the switch can of course reach everything on 172.55.x.x, since they are pointed to the 172.55.1.1 gateway for that network.
 I've tried next-hop routes, such as 172.55.0.0 / 22 > 172.55.1.1 but that didn't help. 
 Do I have my overload rule backwards? I have a feeling it's something really basic, and I'm just spacing on the problem completely.
 Any assistance would be appreciated.
 Note: I cannot add any routing rules, or otherwise change the router at 172.55.1.1

 I’ve had three jobs in IT and all of them I grew to dislike after some time. The first two, after about 5 years - my current about one year.. It’s to the point where I’ve shared with a coworker or two that I’m thinking of quitting and looking for another job.
 The problem is, I don’t really want another job in IT right now - it’s been soul sucking. I feel like I burned out years ago, I’ve also been dealing with some personal stuff and the stress of IT and the workplace doesn’t help. The thought of hopping from one 8-5 job to another is just depressing. 
 If in six months, a year or two from now I decide to rejoin the IT workforce, would a gap on my resume hurt me?
 I don’t know what I want to do, I just know that I don’t want to keep doing what I’m currently doing. I do have some concerns about leaving a stable job but I’ve not had an issue being hired in the past and it seems like everyone is hiring nowadays.

 Recently multi-factor authentication was activated remote network side - LAN one wants to connect using AnyConnect to.
 To establish VPN to remote network doesn‘t work in the fashion the window pupping up to conduct 2FA- authentication flashes for just fraction of second then disappears from screen. This way user gets no chance to enter and complete multi-factor authentication.
 Is this a known problem pattern? Where to look for possible root causes?
 Let me know please if more details regarding setup in use are needed.
 UPDATE
 I missed to mention one detail. Whole procedure to establish VPN connection completes with other pop-up: Authentication failed due to problem verifying server certificate. Indeed that prob of server certificate verification I have to live with for months, since long before MFA has been introduced network side. Is this possibly the track I have to follow?
 Client side network config actually as delivered by Linux distribution in use. Please note it is about two independent Linux nodes (well, they share however virtualization host). I can‘t talk about network/authentication config remote network side.
 UPDATE II
 CISCO AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client app installer was downloaded from remote network operator. Last available version in use.
 UPDATE III
 Regarding server certificate verification failure I communicated this to organization IT many months ago. However up to this minute no, or incompetent yet upon heavy delay answers.

 The problem is the ISP doesn't allow me to setup my own modem and must use their modem plus they also refused to put the Nokia modem/router in bridge mode. 
 One issue I have been facing is that the Nokia modem hangs every 3-5 days... a simple restart fixes it but not the type of solution I want especially considering that every time it is down I recieved 50 calls!! Isp replaced the modem 3 times but with the same model and after a few months starts hanging.
 What are the possible issues that I may face in this type of setup? What do you guys recommend? 
 Any suggestions apart from taking the ISP tomcourt..

 Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask about this, I want to rearrange and help declutter our network racks for the company I work for.
 Basically the person that set them up is no longer with the company so I have no idea how it was all set up or what the credentials are for the network switches/firewalls. We have a Gigabit fibre leased line. We also have some Dell SonicWalls, TP Link managed switches and a PowerDSine 6548 POE.
 There's ethernet connectivity spread out across about 8 rooms.
 I've only dealt with personal networking, not enterprise, so I feel like I may be a little out of my depth here, just want to see what your thoughts are and what you would do in my position?
 Edit - Thank you so much for everyone's answers, I will follow the main advice you gave which is to not touch it and try to get an IT professional to come. Thanks again 😀

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone ever added custom attributes, specifically for AD users (e.g. Gender, Prefix, ManagerEmail, CostCenter), to their AD environment? I've read quite a bit of things, this MS doc especially, and watched a handful of videos. It seems very simple and straightforward. As long as you don't change what is already configured for existing schema objects, it doesn't seem like a terribly difficult task. I do have my AD's existing OID, so i can follow the MS best practices for addeding .X.X numbers as needed.
 Any experiences or gotchas to share?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone run into this yet? It is very frustrating for our users. We recently started deploying Windows 11 machines and ran into this issue.
 ​
 If the user sends a print job to our Ricoh MP C3003, then sends another print job before the first one finishes, there is a high change that they receive an error popup and then half the job gets cancelled.
 ​
 I unfortunately do not have the exact wording of the message or where it is coming from. It disappears too quickly for them to get a screenshot. They said it says "Error Printing", followed by the file name and I think it is popping up from the print task tray icon. There is nothing in the event viewer for these that I can find.
 ​
 None of our Windows 10 boxes are experiencing this issue but all of the Windows 11 machines have at least once. Our printers are on a 2016 print server. We've reconfigured a couple to go directly to the printer instead but that didn't seem to help any. I believe it is happening on all of our printers, but the Ricoh is the only one I have log proof of.
 ​
 Googling "Error Printing Windows 11" isn't really giving me anything useful as you could imagine. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

 for my lab I need a cheap SAN solution to create some LUNs and map them to two servers via FC.
 I need these features:
 - RAID Controller supporting RAID5
 - fits SAS HDDs (I have some lying around here)
 - at least 2 FC Ports (2 Gbit should be enough)
 - WebGUI for configuration / creating LUNs etc
 - Price ~500$ without disks
 - At least basic features working without license (I dont need replication, encryption, deduplication etc.)
 Most used/refurbished stuff I found needs some legacy software which has to be licensed. 
 I would be happy for recommendations!
 Thanks

 Has anyone come across something similar that might work with Teams or VoIP systems to make the ringer very loud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are running Microsoft Exchange Version 15.0 build 1497.2 on Windows Server 2012.
 We have an internal mailbox that forwards all emails to a contact on a different domain. So all emails to user@in.com are forwarded to user@out.com. User is a member of a distribution group, group@in.com. So when an email is sent to group@in.com it sends it to user@in.com which then forwards it to user@out.com.
 The error occurs when user@out.com sends an email to group@in.com. It sends correctly to everyone else, but when it tries to forward to user@out.com it sends a 550:
  
user@out.com
 host URL [IP]
 SMTP error from remote mail server after end of data:
 550 permanent failure for one or more recipients (user@out.com:blocked)
  
After testing, it gives the same error when user@out.com directly sends to user@in.com. They receive all emails to group@in.com sent by other users.
 I assume there is some sort of recursive error that flags it as spam because it is trying to forward an email from itself to itself. Other than just having them not use user@out.com to send emails to group@in.com, does anyone have any idea how to fix this?

This worked well and allowed the user to change her wallpaper freely when she wanted to and when she signed out for the day it didn't set the default wallpaper the next time she logged in. However, when the server reboots the Setwallpaper script reappears in her user startup folder. I seen this article below, but it doesn't seem theirs a way to just remove it completely for EC2 instances besides just manually removing it or creating a script to remove it each time.
 ​
 Anyone know a way to stop EC2 Instances from adding the Setwallpaper script to the user folder?

Asking provider says that a micro code is inserted in these drives and maybe has been wiped out. We have erased other drives for EMC and HPE and we haven't had this issue. 
 I am planning to purchase a new OceanStor drive and clone drives but Im not sure if that should work. 
 Has anyone worked with OceanStor systems and has recovered micro code. Should cloning drives resolve the issue?

 I've hit a bit of a weird issue this morning. Over the weekend all of our devices using the Android/iOS Outlook app were re-quarantined - around 4000 devices. I've checked and the rule for quarantine hasn't been amended recently which was my initial thought. Is there a way I can track what caused it? Going through the MSExchange Management Event Logs, I can see events for when I have re-approved the devices but nothing for the quarantine.
 Looking further into the logs, it appears all the devices are being detected with a different DeviceId.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an attachment filter rule on my M365 tenant that Quarantines HTML attachments, as the overwhelming majority are phishing messages. There was a previous edge case that allowed attachments with trailing periods to bypass the rule, which with the help of some redditors I solved with a little regex (see this archived thread). My successful rule looks like this in the M365 Exchange Admin:
 Apply this rule if Is received from 'Outside the organization' and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: '\.htm\.$' or '\.html\.$' or '\.inetloc\.$' or '\.htm$' or '\.html$' or '\.inetloc$' 
 But now I'm seeing another edge case where attachments with encoded filenames are also bypassing the rule. I determined that the encoding for .htm and .html are "odG1s?=" and "odG0=?=", so I added them to the rule, but they are still getting through:
 Apply this rule if Is received from 'Outside the organization' and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: '\.htm\.$' or '\.html\.$' or '\.inetloc\.$' or '\.htm$' or '\.html$' or '\.inetloc$' or 'odG1s?=$' or 'odG0=?=$' 
 The email source looks like this:
 ----==_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585 Content-Type: application/html Content-Transfer-Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Disposition: attachment; Filename="=?UTF-8?B?NjUzNC5odG0=?=" <script language="javascript"> document.write(unescape('<redacted>'));</script> ----==_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585-- 
 Any ideas on how to get the existing rule to recognize these types of attachments? Or do I just need to write another one that looks at the Content-Disposition header separately, not depending on Microsoft's interpretation of it?

 I've been trying to implement Microsoft recommended rules to block TCP445/SMB connections.
 We have VPN set up, to connect to Azure Wirtual Network (our whole domain structure is in Azure).
 So i created a GPO with the following firewall rules:
  
 Block all inbound SMB 445 (made no changes here)
  Block outbound Guest/Public SMB 445 (made no changes here)
  Allow outbound Domain/Private SMB 445 (changed Remote Port to Local Port and Scope Remote to Scope Local and typed in virtual network address range)
  Block outbound Domain/Private SMB 445 (changed Remote Port to Local Port)
 Security connection rules (made no changes here)
  
Gpupdate /force works fine, so i guess its all good? Did i do that correctly?
 ​
 Also thinking about Network security: Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain.
 I've been tracking NTLM\Operational in event viewer, but there are no logs.
 Does that mean i can set the value to one of the Deny ones?
 ​
 Please keep in mind I'm a newbie, thank you.

I’ve mentioned that it would be difficult to stop accidental or intentional downloading of data, if they have viruses on their phones they can infiltrate the company.
 How do I make the policy so tight that no one will want to use a personal phone (I know some still may try without adhering to it but at least that way it’s their fault for not being complaint). If anyone has any examples or templates they can share that would be great.
 The boss in question was hacked previously and still wants to go ahead with this is, and he tends to blame whoever he can even if they have no involvement in an issue. I’ve chosen to stop saying no directly to him because I’ve realised I could have been fired for this after seeing they way he has treated other staff and of course… he is friends with the CEO and CFO.
 And yes resumes have been flying and I may leave soon but just in case I stay I want to have a plan B.

 do any of you have experience with how many thousands of TCP connections we should expect at our central proxy when we roll out M365 (Teams, OneDrive, Sharepoint Online, Exchange Online etc.)? For regulatory reasons, we may not route traffic past the proxy (as Microsoft recommends).
 I realize it's difficult to give an exact number but maybe someone of you has some experiences with concrete numbers (amount users -> amount TCP conncection in average/peak during the day).

My new role, in government, needs a little more, attention and formality.
 What do you folks use to write out your project scopes and manage them? How do you present them?
 I appreciate your wisdom!

 I have problem with configuration NVME over ROCE on vSphere 7.0.3. My storage is Huawei Dorado 3000 v6 and network card is Intel(R) Ethernet Controller E810-XXV for SFP which supports NVME over ROCE. I installed the latest update, for Icen version 1.11.3.0, irdman 1.4.3.0 and for Huawei Dorado 6.1.5. I made the configurations based on the Huawei guide. ROCE interface are connected directly to the server. The ports have VLAN 55 for controller A and VLAN 56 for controller B. I created logical ports to which I assigned physical ports. On vSphere I created virtual switches for each VLAN, next created storage adapters with NVME over RDMA. The problem occurs when I try to connect the controller. When I type IP Address, vsphere finds nothing. Has anyone had a similar problem or know what else I can do?

 How would you go about providing a solution? Could use teams but that would mean assigning each user a license and signing in and out whenever they come and go which is not nice.
 Would rather not use a third party IM app that one would have to sign up for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there.
 We are in the process of migrating our O365 Licensing from E3->Business Premium to take advantage of the additional security features available.
 We have had E3 for a number of years now, and probably 10% of our users are affected by the reduction of mailbox size from 100GB->50GB. 
 We currently do not have any archive policies in place, but I wonder how other companies deal with archive/large mailboxes after a user has departed the organization.
 Typically, when we offboard a user - we convert the mailbox to shared mailbox, and remove the license. But documentation indicates that shared mailboxes are limited to 50gb. Historically, when we would offboard a user who's mailbox is bigger than 50GB, we would add in an Exchange E2 license to allow access to the mailbox.
 If we DID have an archive policy in place, presumably after we converted the users mailbox to a shared - the archived mailbox would disappear at some point?
 These discussions happening as we determine the best path our our existing LARGE mailboxes (who are licensed with E3) - that we want to get licensed for Business Premium. Initial thought is toss on a Business Premium AND an E2 as a top up to 100GB - BUT the Business Premium licensing DOES allow for very large archiving... But - what happens when that person leaves the org?

 Our organization is planning to procure firewalls to enhance our security posture. We are considering two options:
  
Using a big-size Palo Alto firewall with multiple virtual contexts each for perimeter, data center, internal segmentation, and internet-facing DMZ or
 Implementing multiple layer firewalls from different vendors - one for the perimeter network and DMZ, and another for the data center and internal segmentation.
  
Our goal is to control both data center east-west traffic and south-north traffic from the client to the data center. We want to ensure that our chosen solution provides the best security and flexibility for our organization.
 I would like to hear from the community regarding their experiences and recommendations for firewall solutions. What are the pros and cons of each option, and what are the potential challenges and considerations that we should be aware of before making a decision?
 Thank you in advance for your insights and contributions to this discussion.

However, I don't have any certifications, and I was added to the senior engineering team at this company. It felt like ( and still sometimes does ) I'm underqualified for the position. I was told my hiring manager a big reason I was selected for the role was outstanding soft-skills but I feel like for my current role I'm lacking a bit in more technical areas. Most of my coworkers on my team are senior Network Engineers with 15-20+ years on me, and while I'm learning practically every minute, I feel like I want to pursue a certification of some sort to solidify my skills. I also want something to increase salary potential down the road. Right now, being part of the LAN team, I deal mostly with L2 & L3 switching and I enjoy it. I'm considering studying for the CNNA and eventually CCNP. I also work closely with a CCNP and his knowledge and experience troubleshooting at the packet level is something I'm aspiring too. Given all this, do you think my time and effort be better spent studying for something else?

One of my main responsibilities is being a server admin for a k12 district. We have survived ransomware several years ago and my responsibilities have only grown since then. I know for my own mental health I have to disconnect and leave work at work but it can be difficult sometimes with a looming fear that some hacker out there wants nothing more than to destroy everything that we’ve built. I was just wondering how some of you deal with this type of thing as I know it is common in our field. Be safe out there and take needed time for yourself and your family life. Burnout is real.
 Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice and kind words. It’s tough out there and things can be stressful at times so prepare the best you can to deal with situations when they happen. The best option being to have shared knowledge and responsibilities. Backup what’s important and document everything that would help in the event of a disaster. Don’t shoulder the burden alone. A job is not worth your mental health. Stay safe out there and take care of yourselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I had the privilege of taking a look through our annual PCI self-assessment quiz that our security team fills out. I had no idea how far out of compliance we were! But to maintain our PCI eligibility, they've been answering all these questions in the affirmative year after year.
 These are not "grey area" questions or things that could be plausibly misunderstood. These are things that we clearly, tangibly do not do or have in place. The costs and turnaround time for putting this all into place would be enormous.
 So now I'm wondering, is this par for the course? Is PCI compliance just a dance where companies nod their head during interrogation and then roll over and take their beating if they ever do happen to get breached? Do the security people signing off on this ever get charged with fraud?
 Not really any of my business, I'm not responsible for filling out this form or evidencing the claims, but holy cow...

 I can encrypt the boot drive (SSD raid) with Bitlocker no problem. When I go do this with the secondary raid (HDDs) it is coming up as a removable drive and asking for Bitlocker to go. Need to make it a fixed data drive so that I can encrypt the drive with the TPM.

 "No!" He insisted, "the memory is on 40% when I turn the PC on!"

 Dude you should say thank you! Some machines I'm working with use double that!

 Anyway, he wants me to disable the AV to get some more CPU out (It wasn't even on the top 15 apps in the task manager, but whatever).

 I play around with the management console, do nothing and promise him it's OK now.

 First of all, this is my first time posting here so I don't know if this is the right way to do it.
 I am trying to set up a PC for public use. Specifically, for an interactive art installation. What I am going to present is a "trojan" (not malicious) written in .VBS that takes control of the system and displays visual content as if it were a movie. The thing is that since I want to maintain the interactivity, being a public space, I need to isolate somehow the system and restrict unwanted activity (avoiding having to go to repair it continuously).
 I had thought about Microsoft's Kiosk mode, but I have Windows Home and I can't use it. With this, I thought of virtualizing a machine, but if the software crashes I don't know how I could automate the execution. Finally, I thought of using an isolated user and through UAC limit its range of action, but I don't know.
 What do you think? I can't find the solution.
 Thanks!

 Does OS rewrite the whole disk or there is a good part outside OS and boot partitions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a little background about me. A couple of years ago I graduated with an MIS degree (jack of all trades, not specialized in any), and got a helpdesk position for 1.5 years as of now with zero experience in IT cause I had no idea what I wanted to do. The hiring person (who is my lead) in the company gave me the opportunity even when I had zero experience whatsoever. I had the opportunity to learn how to do some basic helpdesk stuff like troubleshooting, push software via SCCM, image/reimage laptops, intune, exchange admin center, active directory, etc.
 A month ago, the infrastructure manager saw me at the front desk and came up to me and we kind of sparked a conversation about what I wanted to do, work goals, etc. I told him I wanted to work on cloud stuff, especially AWS, and how I loved the company. He came back a couple of weeks to the front desk and told me to apply for a sys admin position for his team in the same company that just got posted. So, I did and here I am now for an interview opportunity for this position. 
 I guess what I'm trying to figure out is how to do I go about this interview, this is something I want to do and I'm very anxious and nervous about how to approach this interview because I have limited interview experience:
 Here are some of the tasks, the role will be doing:
 • Performing daily operations and maintenance of the Enterprise Server infrastructure. This infrastructure includes VMWare, Windows Servers, Active Directory, File and Print Management, System Center Configuration Manager, SharePoint, SQL, Nagios, Rubrik, and Ansible. 
 • Working with engineers across the enterprise to ensure that the Company's servers and workstations are patched and upgraded in a timely manner. 
 • Helps develop solutions, design, and system architecture. 
 • SCCM Administration • Dell/EMC – VXRails maintenance and upgrades 
 • VMWare Workspace One and Horizons Administration 
 • Active Directory Administration 
 • Azure and AWS

The company makes use of MS Teams, and the entire Office365 ecosystem so I'll be stuck using Windows on my workstation. (Traditionally in this type of role I'd use Linux as my OS, I like my environment to match production settings.) 
 So starting from a clean slate, would you use WSL(2) or a full HyperV VM as your 'home' to interface with a linux server fleet? 
 WSL would be easiest, but a VM would be most comprehensive. I'd like to hear you opinions.

 It took me almost 2 months since my first post about DEVCOR to commit but now I'm all in. DEVCOR is an expensive exam, $480 (incl. taxes) is not really cheap, so I've spent extra $90 on the official assessment exam in order to get understanding of what topics and level of detail to expect, learn the format of the exam and to know what topics I need to revise. It has 80 % passing score, I scored 59 % on the first try with no study and 82 % on the second after revising for a day. I am much more relaxed now that I have a better picture of what the exam is like.
 With 3 days left I plan to skim through the official study guide, focusing on topics I failed in the practice exam. If you have anything to point out or recommend to focus on I'll appreciate your ideas.

 I'm a sysadmin at a few schools, and I'm trying to deploy a GPO to restrict EXE games which the students appear to be running from their desktops. I essentially followed this guide:
 https://blogs.manageengine.com/corporate/general/2018/10/25/application-whitelisting-using-software-restriction-policies.html
 I've got a test OU with a Software Restriction Policy deploying. I've got my computer in there and also a user. I've tested SRP under User and also Computer and can confirm the GPO is reaching the machine.
 However, weirdly it seems as if none of the path rules are doing anything? I've explicitly blocked several paths and extensions (EXE's, MSI's, BAT's, etc) and as the user, I can run BAT's and EXE's with no worries whatsoever. The student account I am testing with is not a local administrator either. 
 I've been troubleshooting this all week and am completely lost now. There are no SRP logs in Event Viewer either, so I can't even see why it isn't working. 
 Any advice for me here is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
 EDIT - Might have my answer already. I’m running 22H2 and SRP is deprecated in favour of AppLocker. Thanks everyone!

 In the past you would buy VPLS if you were, let's say, a hosting company with more sites and needed to migrate the VM's from one site to the other without changing the IP address.
 But now, if you are the same hosting company, you can just run OSPF from the CE to the PE and advertise Loopback of all VTEP's and deploy EVPN VXLAN on your switches.
 So my question is maybe especially for SP guys: who's buying L2VPN?

 I've heard of companies wanting one or two, maybe three managerial references. Something which I'm not comfortable with because, well, my coworkers know me better. And quite frankly many of my former supervisors were less than on-the-level in one way or another. Listing every single one, though? Mmm no.
 Additional information:
 I should clarify the story a wee bit. The company in question is setting up a bid proposal for a contract with a government entity. The government entity already has something in place regarding work history and general trustworthiness--if they had any questions they could look someone up. The information is available, they just have to reach out to X org.

 Basically some of our team are troubleshooting TLOS faults, where auto neg is disabled, setting neg to auto, then closing the job, when in reality, the neg settings have no bearing on the functionality of the circuit and the TLOS is being caused by something else, which is missed because of the assumption that auto neg being disabled was causing the fault. Any technical explanation for this phenomena would may help where my logic and real world examples have failed to convince colleagues.

 Novice networker here. I set up a network for a few devices at work to communicate with each other. I expected limited capability to connect to various wifi networks, but I thought I could at least connect to my personal iPhone hotspot. However, I cannot even do that.

It's super simple to get a DHCP server running using a L3 port on a router, just configure the pool, give the L3 port an IP in the pool and boom, anything that connects to that port will be able to pull an IP address.
 But when I try to use an SVI and a L2 port instead I can't get it to work. I've got a vlan interface with an IP address in the pool, then I put the L2 port in that vlan, but clients can't get IPs. Is there some other piece that I'm missing? Or is it even possible to configure a DHCP server this way?

 Now I feel that there has been a blurred line between help desk issues and true Sysadmin. This sub is mainly filled with people complaining about users or their shitty job and not about any complex or difficult issue they are trying to solve. 
 I think there should be a mandatory flair for user related issues or job so we can just mentally filter those posts out. Or these people should just move over to r/helpdesk since most are not sysadmins to begin with. 
 Tho I feel for some that are a one man shop help desk/ admin. Which is why a flair revamp might be better direction. 
 Thoughts ?

 For example, a phrase like "Ihaveareallybighouse!" is 21 characters with upper, lower, and special characters and https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/ says it would take "1 hundred quintillion years" to crack whereas passwordmonster.com says it would take 3 days lol.
 I'm just wondering do you have any tools you trust to give to end users to help them make sure they are choosing good passwords?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To those of you who must support legacy applications whose servers cannot be re-IP’d - in an active/passive production DC/DR DC type setup, I’m curious how you’ve setup your core routing to advertise your production subnets in an actual DR scenario, while in a passive/DR testing scenario - keeping the DR’d replica subnets local to the DR site.
 For example, my production DC subnets are say: 10.0.0.0/22 carved out into 4 subnets with SVIs: 10.0.0.1/24, 10.0.1.1/24, 10.0.2.1/24, 10.0.3.1/24 on the core.
 In my DR site I have some active subnets/SVIs for management/jump box that are always advertised: 10.1.0.1/24, 10.1.1.1/24 on the core.
 I do not stretch layer-2 between my prod and DR sites. In a DR scenario, in my DR site I can bring up and advertise matching subnets/SVIs matching those from my production site - who theoretically just got blown up and is unreachable. I can bring up my VMs and infrastructure through replication. My MPLS provider speaks EIGRP with me so I can reannounce that 10.0.0.0/22 now lives in DR. This is all fine and tested.
 My issue is that in a test scenario where I want to bring up VMs and test them on their original subnets - I’m curious how you folks would handle this. Would you advertise with a lower metric and risk a split brain routing scenario (scary)? Would you suppress advertisements until you’re ready to be in a DR scenario (seems safer)?
 I can comfortably automate these types of changes via Cisco scripting/my choice of automation front end. I just want to be able to test these VMs from a sandbox in DR that you can get to via a jump box.
 Open to all ideas and possibilities! Just curious what others have done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm testing two DELL S5048F with VLT and peer routing. I have a doubt regarding the primary node failure.
 This is the configuration: sw-core1 is the primary node, sw-core2 is the backup node. Peer routing is enabled on both nodes.
 Both switches contains VLAN 40 and VLAN 50 with an ip address assigned. sw-core1 is the default gateway for the devices inside VLAN 40 and VLAN 50.
 These are the tests performed:
 When both switches are powered on devices on VLAN 40 can ping the devices on VLAN 50 as expected.
 When one switch are powered off (failure scenario) PC on VLAN 40 can ping the PC on VLAN 50 as expected.
 If during a failure scenarion of the primary node (sw-core1 powered down) I restart the backup node (sw-core2) after the boot I cannot ping any device indefinitely. Only powering on the sw-core1 restore the comunication.
 Is this a correct behavior or I'm missing something in the configuration? It could be a normal behavior because at the startup sw-core2 has only the ip assigned locally and cannot synchronize with sw-core1. So, the backup node cannot know the IPs assigned to the sw-core1 interfaces.
 Thank you. Regards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently struggling with a task regarding Conditional Access Policies.
 We want (must) allow users to use Teams on their private computers at home, because not all have work devices and teams via citrix is just not useable at all, but they should not be allows any other cloud app such as Exchange Online, Sharepoint, or so.
 So i created 2 policies:
 1: "External Device Access": This policy applies if the device is not on a trusted network, applying to All Cloud apps - excluding "Microsoft Teams", as grant access it requires a compliant domain joined device with multi factor every x hours.
 2: "Allow Teams everywhere": This policy applies if the device is not on a truste network, but only to the Cloud app "Microsoft Teams", as grant access it only requires multi factor every x hours.
 So far so good, Exchange Online, Sharepoint does not work on non domain joined devices now, but so does Teams. The second CA policy never gets triggered for some reason and i dont know why.
 Has anyone of you something similar done already?

 For you admin guys what are the best practices when create a Distribution List (nomenclature)?
 examples: (DisplayName)
 [DL-Customer-Test](mailto:DL-customertest@contoso.com)
 DL-Customer Test
 Customer Test
 ........
 What I mean is like in our company there is not a lot of organization for example we have distribution lists with "dots","hyphen", etc ex:([customer.Test-delivery@](mailto:costumer.Test-delivery@)....)
 what I mean I guess It could be more organize with a structure
 Ex: [Costumer-test-Delivery@](mailto:Costumer-test-Delivery@)... or DL-CostumerTestDelivery
 This way I was asking if you guys have a structure when creating a Distribution List?
 Thank you so much

 Going on day 7 without our vdi environment, it should be back up tomorrow morning though with a few tweaks. They have had the ability to have our hd retrieve docs to work on offline all week though on personal machines. (I know not great, but needed) 
 Management has been nice to be when Ive crossed paths and said how much they appreciate all the effort. Made sure we have been fed all week working around the clock at least. 
 I think the BOD is giving my managers a much different front though. 
 I'm an engineer and have been onsite/online for 14+ average since it started 9 days ago. Today my manager told another engineer that the bod expectation is we are here around the clock until it gets fixed and was pretty pushy about it. 
 Has anyone experience an IT purge shortly after an incident? Would it just be management? Or have you seen whole departments be evicted and outsourced? 
 I'm just trying to think through the odds I don't have a job in a month and if this place is worth putting in the hours for now...
 To clarify, I'm also an engineer, which I hope would help protect my job a bit more.

It's your job to ask the right questions when they don't know what's happening. And come on, who here has never forgotten a password? I don't understand people's need to get combative with users, especially to the point of pulling logs? Like that's just completely unproductive and makes you very unpopular in the long run, even to the techs who have to deal with the further frustrated users. Explaining complex systems to everyone in terms that make sense is an important part of our jobs.
 Edit: Folks, I agree users should have basic computer skills, but it’s been my experience at least that the people who do the hiring and firing don’t care about that as much as we do… So unless someone is doing something dangerous or egregious, this is also an unfortunate part of the job we have to accept.

 To create these golden images, we use Hyper-V to create a checkpoint, then Sysprep and boot to WinPE. We then use DISM capture-image commands to capture the WIM file.
 However, I was wondering if there is a more efficient way to automate the image capture process

 So as the title says, I have a former employee that has 2FA for the Google Workspace account set to their personal number and now that we are off-boarding them we have an issue. I need to Migrate their account to an Archive we set up which requires an app password to do. Unfortunately, I cannot create that app password without verifying 2FA to the employee's number. Has anyone been able to change the phone number for a users 2FA? We have 2FA set up for the whole org so turning it off just for this person isn't really the move. I have some ideas for general workaround but Im curious if anyone has experience with this. Thank you all for your input!

 We now have this policy in place that, when you're let go, you start a "countdown" till your last day. Some layoffs have been 30 days, some have been 60 days, some have been two weeks. But while you're "counting down," you can take all the paid time off you want to look for a job. Some managers let you go home with your laptop and just WFH till your last day.
 Now, as generous as this sounds, they do this for a singular reason. If you find another job during your countdown, you're not eligible for the severance package.
 Well, we had one guy that had been there FOREVER and got laid off. He was eligible for well over 6 months' salary in severance. Out of respect for his long history with the company, his manager let him WFH during his whole 30 day countdown...
 28 days into his countdown, someone from my company goes to another company to have lunch with a friend. And he sees his old coworker working there at a desk, with our company laptop with the asset tag clearly visible on the open lid. When the guy walks away from his desk, sure enough, it's our laptop. The guy is VPNed in, and logged into Outlook and MS Lync (This should tell you how long ago this happened).
 The guy comes back from lunch and tells his coworkers about how the guy they lost on the team landed at a new company where this guy they know works. Sadly, the manager overheard them talking. He called HR. And the guy lost his severance package.
 So damn close...

 EDIT 2: Mostly need to check which devices are always online (most likely servers), which come and go (most likely teachers), and which static IPs never go active (So I can reassign them as I need)
 Hey guys, new here, first of all I'm from Chile so my English might not be perfect. I'm at a new job on this university, where they already have a complex network as I've seen, but they never kept track of it internally (I mean on my department) besides having an old Excel which isn't even up to date (Lots of devices that doesn't exist anymore and new ones that weren't registered).
 I'm trying to monitor this network, for which I already tried Solarwinds (which have 50 sensors in its free version) and Nagios (which seems unpractical since I have to manually categorize every device and I can't confirm every single one of them). Is there any solution that allows me to just make an in real time scan on an IP range constantly just to ping active hosts? Preferably It'd be nice to keep track of the last time in which devices were active. I can run a server.
 Thanks in advance and sorry for my English.

 Ok, cool, let's take a look.
 Yep, lots of disconnects in the logs. Looks like for all the users at that company too.
 Both Office, and warehouse PCs.
 Error codes indicate that the traffic from the client just stopped.
 K, Lets take a look at one of the PCs.
 They're using wireless. ok...

 I am a system admin for various companies. I essentially consult but in a way i am onsite with the company handling all their docs, internal items, and other for smaller companies which is why i can administrate so many at once. I have one company i've been with for 10+ years but they got bought out and now have an MSP, that literally just keeps making mistake after mistake. They are never onsite, they move around reservations DHCP and change scopes due to lack of knowing the firewall, and generally cause the site a lot of issues. Which is great for me right, i make a ton of money off their mistakes. Sorry but that isn't my game. I like good business and administration, not causing a hedge fire and saying o well #xyz is just another client. Recently i did a large overhaul and installation of new networks, vlans, wifi, ect... Today i get a call they made more changes and now changed the firewall password essentially forcing everything through them which for me means extra hours billing to wait on a tech. Is it time to just let the clients turn into an inferno and go about my day or should i be grateful my income is probably going to double from them and just shut up and color?
 It just really freakin urks me how bad they are for such a large company taking care of a small hotel which is literally nothing to manage. How do you guys deal with bad MSP's that the company is married into?

The role of this Ring Descriptor is to tell the NIC where in some pre-allocated memory pool are there free objects for the NIC to DMA it's receiving packets. There seems to be a Receive Ring Descriptor and Transmit Ring Descriptor.
 Questions:
 (1) Are these Ring Descriptors stored in memory or on the NIC?
 (2) I've occasionally read about receive queues, are these different from Receive Ring Descriptors? If so where are these stored, on the NIC or memory? ... I've specifically read that the packets first get written to the Receive queues and then from there to pre-allocated memory pool, however can't find anything conclusive on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning fellow sysadmins,
 Ive been advised of an employee who’s contract ends in a week, and has not been renewed. The employee knows this, and is fairly pissed off about it, Ive been told.
 We are a M365 shop, with Intune, and Sophos Firewalls with filtering, Backups in the cloud etc.
 While I have no reason to be concerned, since the user doesnt have any type of admin credentials or can do anything (and complains about it constantly), I was wondering what else I can do to restrict the user in case of any acting out. 
 My current plan is to nuke his laptop from orbit (wipe) once I get it, and his office accounts will just get moved to shared mailboxes, etc. All his access will get cut off at the time of his last minute etc. 
 Of course, he may just decide to push his laptop off the edge of desk, which isn’t my problem either. 
 Ive never really thought about what else is out there, so I thought I would throw it out here just to see what others say. Im sure there are some stories that have a lesson out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A have large site network that, once upon a time, needed 21 MST instances. Over the years, the topology was consolidated so that one of two core switches became the root bridge for every VLAN at the site. The appropriate number of MST instances for us to have today is two.
 We knock down and stand up subnets all the time, and every time we do, we have to pick an unused VLAN tag that is already mapped to one of the 21 MST instances—which is fine, but the instances have no bearing to what we actually do. When an engineer asks, "Which instance should I pull this tag from?" the answer is, "Whichever you want." Consequently, things are so mixed up that we'd have to not only create a new MST region, but basically start over with our VLAN tag/subnet associations to get them into the correct one of the two new instances.
 I'm not clinically OCD, but I hate inefficiency and inconsistency. Hate. It. If this were a small business, I'd be willing to substantially inconvenience my life to clean this up during maintenance windows. But this is a site that has hundreds of VLANs, 600 users, a datacenter with 80 server racks, and a significant internet presence. When a city has poor road design, we all live with it because it's impossible to fix without knocking the city down. I'm thinking this might be one of those situations. I've never tried to fix an MST region before, but I know it can't be done without downtime. And literally the only people who even know about this inconvenience are the network team. Cleaning it up will not noticeably improve network function.
 Do you agree that we should just deal with it forever? What kinds of unfixable legacy spaghetti configs exist on your network?

 I'm relatively new to networking, and need to find out the Tx Power Range and Receiver Sensitivity of a batch of 1G LRs. 
 Is there a way I can calculate this with a switch, or do I need to purchase some specialist kit?
 Cheers all.

Are you still having your WSUS download all necessary Windows client and server updates to one WSUS server and distribute them to both clients & servers? or are you having your clients & servers get their updates directly from Microsoft (with WSUS just doing the approvals)? Or are you doing a mix of both, with potentially clients going to the internet and the servers still using the WSUS server to get theirs? (and on that last note, can WSUS be setup to distribute updates to servers, but ask clients to download their own updates from the internet?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 My video production house is upgrading it’s infrastructure for remote work. One of our needs is a rack of Mac Studios for remote work. However, we want two stations in our office to be available for remote people to use when needed. In an ideal world, those two stations could be connected to any of the Mac Studios at any time. The Macs would live in our data closet, and the stations would be about 30 feet away near a fiber-connected switch (if that makes a difference).
 My first thought was a KVM, but I’ve heard that these are not the most reliable in terms of latency. Each station would have two monitors, mouse, keyboard, and headphones.
 Does anyone know if this is viable with hardware? My backup solution would be to use Jump desktop to remote into the stations via LAN, which I think would work just as well.
 Thanks!

 I can provide up to about 6 SIM cards, each with unlimited internet access. Also important to mention I guess would be, that I live in Germany, but also travel some times within Europe. What would you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a 'glue' to unload routes from a database into kernel routing tables.
 I marked routes from my 'glue' code with a custom 'proto' (42 is babel, 2 is static, 186 is bgp). I use a different number '111' for my routes. This really helps me to know if I should add/delete a route or not.
 Now I want to import routes from kernel into Bird, but I can't find a way to specify 'proto'. (My search is complicated by the fact that Bird is using word 'protocol' to name own pieces of config).
 Is there a way to say Bird to export routes with a specific proto num?
 The current import stanza in my bird looks like this:
 ``` table kern_91;
 filter private_only { if (net ~ [10.0.0.0/8+]) then { accept; } reject; }
 protocol kernel kern_91 { kernel table 91; learn; ipv4 { table table_91; import filter private_only; export none; }; } ```
 I I just can't find a place for proto 111 anywhere around. Is it possible?
 This is example of the route I want to import:
  10.10.10.0/24 via 127.0.0.1 dev lo table 91 proto 111 scope 0

At present, we use a Public Folder mailbox to manage project team emails, and the mailbox database has grown to 125GB in size. It would be much larger than that if we weren't using Metalogix Archive Manager to archive many of those Public Folder emails.
 The Public Folder database in Exchange Online is 100GB and Shared Mailbox is 100GB, which is insufficient for our needs. I'm exploring alternative solutions for sharing emails among project team members. I'm hoping my situation is not uncommon.
 Below is an image of how we've structured the public folder mailbox for email sharing:

 So we are refreshing 8-10 computers in our network with windows 11. After going through all of the headache to actually get the image captured we are now trying to deploy them with pxe through fog.
 Normally this process for win10 machines takes about 10-15 minutes and done. For some reason windows 11 takes HOURS and the counter keeps going up. Eventually reaching a point where it's not feasible to let it continue.
 We are a small school corporation with TONS of network bandwidth so it is not bottle necking there. The image is just basic 11 with our office keys and a couple things of basic software so it's not a massive image.
 I am at a complete and total loss... any help/guidance would be appreciated

 edit: The machine I am pushing the image to is a Lenovo M70Q Gen 3 if that helps

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We are planning to harden our internal cryptography and after doing my due diligence I came with following settings (they will be applied via GPO, slowly, one by one to servers and endpoints) as something what makes sense now. 
 SSL 2.0 - Disabled
 SSL 3.0 - Disabled
 TLS 1.0 - Disabled
 TLS 1.1 - Disabled
 TLS 1.2 - Enabled
 TLS 1.3 – System default
 Ciphers in order:
 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 What worries me, is quite short list of ciphers which were left after eliminating everything what is considered as a weak.
 I realize that some strange legacy systems will be a problem but I’m looking for advise from somebody who recently harden windows cryptography in their environment, what problems can potentially occur with standard systems, e.g. Windows server and desktop, SQL, IIS, AD, file shares and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am wondering if I can modify old Kensington laptop locks instead of buying the slightly smaller NanoSaver locks.
 The standard Kensington laptop lock slot is 3x7mm, and the newer Kensington NanoSave slot is 2.5x6mm.
 The modification would basically entail grinding/filing off a little metal from the "fingers" of the lock, which grip inside of the locking slot.
 Can anyone see how this mod might compromise the security of the lock vs. buying a NanoSaver lock which already comes with a smaller set of locking fingers? 
 Even out of the box, these types of locks aren't able to prevent a determined attacker anyways (cutting/decoding/picking/impressioning), so perhaps the only point is just to save $$$.
 What do y'all think?

 In case this helps someone out:
 We jumped from E3 to E5 for 400+ users yesterday. Our licenses are applied via AAD Groups where we have license features turned on/off as required. Our CSP/NCE handled the process and opted to upgrade our existing licenses. When the process completed all staff were on E5 with ALL E5 features turned on including Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing.
 Evidently, Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing once enabled does the following:
  
Sends an email to all staff with their personal Audio Conferencing pin information (most of my staff thought this was a phishing email).
 Updates all future and recurring Teams Calendar meeting entries with the new Dial-in features. This uses the Meeting Migration Service (MMS) - Link
 Sends a meeting invite update to all attendees for each updated meeting
 If the recipient has their OoO on, an auto response is of course sent back to the organiser
  
The above has caused mass confusion for our staff and in some instances, users have 60+ meeting invites and auto response/OoO messages all at exactly the same time.
 It's on us for not looking into this more but evidently its caught other people out as well. Link
 Looks like their is a cmd to disable the MMS for changes related to audio conferencing only.
 Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -AutomaticallyMigrateUserMeetings $false 
 Just wish we had known this before.
 Have a nice Friday.........

I want to upgrade the firmware to the latest version, because the one that it has is very old and seems to be buggy sometimes. So I downloaded the image file, navigated to Administration -> Settings Backup & Upgrade, selected the file and hit upload. The progress bar showed up for around 3 seconds and then the page disappeared and a "Connection was reset" error occurred. I tried using different browsers. Then I connected to the device via telnet, and tried to use the admin/upgradeFirm/upgrade command, but no luck here either. I am not sure if I used the command correctly though, because I couldn't find any useful information about it. I tried giving it an IP of a TFTP server and HTTP server, nothing worked, just a "error: Error in Firmware upgrade" message. Invoking "cliErrno get" returned -1, and I don't know what it means. Does anyone have experience with that kind of stuff. Is there any way I can update the firmware or am I stuck with this version? What could cause this, is the router physically damaged? If yes, can I repair it somehow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I work as a tier 2 technician for an MSP and was wondering what other people's experience is with being in an on-call rotation is like, this is my first actual position working directly in IT and based on feedback I have gotten from other people I know in the field I've been told that my on-call rotation unrealistic especially for the return. 
 I work in a team of 4 technicians and 3 of us participate in on-call which consists of being the only user working on after-hours tickets, 5PM-9PM Monday-Friday and 9AM-9PM weekends. We are expected to review any tickets that come in and work on them if they are deemed by either the customer or us important enough to service outside of normal hours, permitting their company has a proper contract for after hours support or they get approval from someone willing to pay the premium. This on-call included driving out to customer locations if the issue is of a truly critical nature. 
 The on-call rotation is a full week from 5PM Friday until the following Friday, and then 2 weeks no on-call for the other 2 on-call technicians, thus a 3-week cycle. The compensation for this on-call is 80 hours of vacation time that is awarded immediately on your start date with no rollover. 
 IF they hire additional Tier 2+ technicians then the rotation would be divided among all applicable techs but it's already been six months and it doesn't seem like they will be getting more people. 
 So yeah let me know what your on-call experiences are like and what you think of mine. Thank you.
 Note: Also for added context the company I work for has terrible procedure, leadership, and communication skills, and almost no one to fall back on if you have trouble resolving an issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks. I work for a small WISP, where we have a VPN to access our stuff out in the field. We have a VPN which for the most part works as expected, that is, until you try it on metro by T-Mobile. At&t and Verizon are fine, but TMobile is having some glitches
 First of all, my TMobile phone has VPN access over wifi, and even when it's roaming on at&t, the VPN works. I mean, I can barely do general web browsing when it roams to at&t, but accessing network resources actually works great. 
 "Well when you say it doesn't work, what do you actually mean by that?"
 Well, I can turn it on and get an IP Address. I can go into visit whoismyisp.com and it will tell me the name of the ISP I work for (and not TMobile ), and web browsing is as good as without a VPN. I can ping the private addresses of stuff on our network. But when I try to log into the GUI of any equipment, it just times out. 
 That seems odd to me that I don't know how that can even work, provided I can definitely get onto the VPN. 
 I am quite confident that reaching out to TMobile will be fruitless in getting the VPN to work properly. Any ideas what I could try here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My peers and I are designing a new network for a school district, let's say... Fake School District. We've hit a good point in our switching and would like to move on to our wireless. In my mind, I would like the SSID's setup like this:
 FSD - Main network; RADIUS for AD authentication FSD_Unsecured - No PSK; MAC ACL; exists only for devices that don't support 802.1X FSD_Setup - No PSK; Access only to the site for agreeing to terms & conditions and downloading the cert for the main network
 I have a few questions about the configuration I proposed here:
 1. Can I use the same NPS I use for the main network for the MAC ACL on the unsecured network? 2. If I register a MAC for the unsecured wireless network, can I dynamically assign a VLAN similar to security groups with my main network? 3. Will I need a web server for the FSD_Setup network or will my WLC (UniFi) do the trick? 
 Basically, I'd like these scenarios to be true:
 Scenario #1: A student brings their own device. They connect to FSD_Setup, click AGREE on the site and it redirects them to a site that downloads the certificate and shows screenshots and instructions for importing it. After importing it, they connect to the FSD network, type in their AD username and password, then, boom! They are now on the Student-Wireless VLAN and can do their assignments.
 Scenario #2: A teacher needs a Chromecast setup to cast to their TV. I take the physical address written on the back, log in to my server and register the device. On the setup wizard for the Chromecast, I join FSD_Unsecured and am now on the TV VLAN.
 Thank you!

 What MS seems to have done in these app execution aliases is set up a seperate listener (with sufficient permissions) that checks if the dummy executables was launched via a command pointing to an executable in the folder of a User Environment Variable, and if the execution alias is enabled. If both checks succeed, the listener launches the modern version of the app.
 The dummy .exe files are located in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps and subfolder(s?)
 The App execution alias settings can be found in ms-settings:advanced-apps > App execution aliases

 Im quite new to this sub-reddit, but enjoying the discussions! I have a question myself. We do a lot of layer-2 networking at our locations, so I wanted to try to implement VTP with Pruning enabled at one of our locations, because the allowed-vlans list at interfaces are not staying up-to-date, which means that there is a lot of unnecessary traffic going over trunk links. I'm having trouble setting up the VTP-pruning configuration. I've consulted a lot of documentation, but I think that I'm missing out on a detail. The vlan's dont seem to be getting pruned. I've taken all of the steps that I read in a lot of guides. I want the interfaces from the coreswitch to the access-switch pruned so that not all of the traffic is going there.

 I found a way to make 100gig work over a single strand of fiber with LC tips. 
 For 100GbE 100 meter, this is my (~$340): https://www.fs.com/products/136833.html?attribute=32524&id=597389 There are some Dell 100GbE 100 meter available (~$1000): https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-networking-transceiver-qsfp28-100gbe-swdm4-duplex-lc-om3-om4-mmf/apd/407-bbvn/networking There are also some 40GbE 300 meter rated (~$300): https://www.fs.com/products/137125.html?attribute=32588&id=597711
 So my questions is. If these exist and work (they do work we tested). Why in the world are people running MPO cable between floors when two strands of LC can net you a 200gjg LAG?
 EDIT: I guess my bigger question is that I read about different types of MPO cabling and how some have more strands than the other. Like I think there is a 100gig MPO cable and a 40gig MPO cable. So I’m just really confused on how we are getting 100gig over a single LC connection.
 And I want to make sure LC over 100gig or 40gig is a supported and qualified technology.

 ​
 I've been struggling to come up with a solution to a problem I'm trying to solve.
 ​
 We have 2 locations, Data Center & HQ. We have APs at both broadcasting the same SSIDs. At the DC, we have a Meraki MX64 concentrator, and at both locations we have Edge FortiGate Firewalls as an Active-Passive HA Pair.
 ​
 What we'd like to do is, for one of our SSIDs (let's call it SSID1), broadcast it at both locations, give it its own DHCP Address Pool, send it to the MX64 concentrator, & out to the Internet through the FortiGate. To accomplish this, I've created an Interface on the FortiGate, & set it as a DHCP Server with the Subnet I want. I've connected the Meraki MX64 concentrator's Internet Port to the FortiGate via our Core Switching Network, the Uplink IP is in the same Subnet & the Gateway is the new interface I created on the Firewall.
 ​
 I've been trying this, but I've been hitting many roadblocks.
 ​
 I've created a test SSID at the Data Center & when I implement, the folks there can't see the SSID in their Wi-Fi list & can't connect to it if they try manually.
 ​
 I'd love to hear any ideas from those with bigger and brighter minds than mine!

Undecided whether I'll go on to pursue my BA, mostly because of the money but my age has a lot to do with it as well. I'll be turning 51 this year and don't want to accumulate unnecessary debt unless I have confidence that there's some type of ROI. Certs are cheaper for sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We are facing an a scalability limitation on our ACI fabric due to our implementation and I am curious if someone has seen a fabric above the Cisco advised "limit".
 Here is a short story, what we have, and we are facing. We are running ACI version 4.2, which is acting as the transit for an NSX-T platform. Due to the implementation of the NSX solution, all of the ESXi hosts are both compute and edge nodes. So, the Edge VMs can shuffle around on the whole ESXi cluster. What this causes in 4.2 ACI, that we need to configure connected ESXi hosts * 2 BGP connectivity profile on each leaf of ours.
 Now this can be fixed with floating L3out on ACI version 5.2, but currently we are in the middle of APIC upgrade and then Fabric upgrade is next. (Corporate politics postponed this longer than should have).
 We realized as a new customer is coming, that we are getting to the advised limit by Cisco on 4.2 ACI.Verified Scalability Guide for Cisco APIC, Release 4.2(2), Multi-Site, Release 2.2(2), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches, Release 14.2(2) - CiscoNumber of BGP/OSPF/EIGRP session per L3 fabric are 3000.
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/5x/verified-scalability/cisco-aci-verified-scalability-guide-521.html
 5.2 Jumps to 10000.
 We asked Cisco and the answer was kind enough to say "Yeah, the huge jump to 10000 is because, we tested with 10000, and we just tested 5.2 more than 4.2".
 This doesn't necessarily gives us the answer we were hoping for. Basically, we would like to know if someone faced this amount of configured BGP connections and went beyond the "limit". We would like to know if any stability in the fabric occurred.

 Lately I have been struggling to choose the right layer 2 vendor (Cisco, Meraki, Ubiquiti Unifi, etc.) for SMB customers who own many switches (let's say 20-30) and want central management for those devices so that you don't have to SSH/Telnet to each every time you want to add a VLAN o change a port.
 I really line the simple pane of glass that Fortinet or Sophos gives you to manage Firewall/Router+Switching+APs but usually HW is too expensive for smaller customers.
 I like Ubiquiti Unifi's APs but switches are very very limited and, as far as I see, don't support stacking for Spine-Leaf design with the core switch formed by two or more stacked switches. The controller approach works very well for the APs and switches, but the later are somewhat still lacking features.
 Has anyone tried Cisco Business Dashboard? Does it really solve the issue to manage and monitor all your local switches from one place? Are the switches good for "prosumer" customers (they look like SF/SG replacements)
 Any other solution you hace tried to solve this that does not involve an enterprice plataform like HPE IMC or Cisco Prime?
 ​
 Thanks.

Don't think we had the same issues with previous WiFi 5 units.
 The coverage in the area in question is brilliant, and in testing signal strength and quality of service with test kit on site I come back no fault found.
 Just want to reach out and see if people have experienced similar, my gut feel is try disabling WiFi 6 but I have no evidence to say why I am doing this. Or something else I'm not thinking of?

 I just recently upgraded my SonicWALL NSA from a 2600 to a 3700. I have 2 users cannot connect to VPN through NetExtender using their home Wi-Fi, but if using an Ethernet cable it works just fine.
 The only correlation between the 2 users they both have Microsoft Surface. One has a Surface Laptop Studio (Win 11) and the other one has a Surface Book 3 (Win 10).
 I've tried multiple versions of NetExtender but to no avail. And I had both users power cycle their cable modems and wireless routers and still nothing.
 Any suggestions how to resolve this issue?

 On an AAD-joined inTune-managed laptop, an AAD user's profile went FUBAR, so I deleted the user using the local admin account, settings, system, advanced system settings, users. Logged off, intending to re-add the user. For no particular reason, I tried to log the user back on with his Win Hello PIN (which I knew because I had set him up and he hadn't changed it). I was surprised that the login was successful; it went right to a new-user Windows Hello setup, where I reassigned him the same PIN.
 It's concerning that the laptop cached the PIN after the user and profile were deleted. I wonder if I had waited, or rebooted, or ... something, if the PIN would have gone away. It strikes me as insecure.
 Does anyone know if this is expected behavior? Shouldn't the deletion in Windows dig out and delete the PIN as well?

 Under Shared Folders on the Advanced Permissions I have both Enable Advanced Folder Permissions and Enable Windows ACL Support ticked.
 I have some shared folders including one called "Test".
 I go to the Test folder in Windows Explorer on one computer and authenticate to the QNAP as an administrator then set the permissions on "Test" using the Windows Explorer Security tab and add my normal domain user account so it has read only access.
 So in Explorer my normal domain user account now shows on the whole of the "Test" folder tree on the Security tab in Windows Explorer.
 When I try to browse the QNAP using my normal domain user account from a domain joined workstation I can browse to \\qnap but as soon as I try to browse into "Test" I get prompted for credentials.
 Entering my normal domain credentials doesn't work.
 Have I missed something please?

 Configure xe-0/4 and xe-0/5 on new core and ToR for a LAG group with lower STP cost and bring those up leaving existing connections. Thinking traffic will then begin utilizing those links and I can safely disconnect the xe-0/0 and xe-0/1 connections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if anyone else had experienced issues with this set up.
 Basically when there is a power outage, despite the server being configured to automatically start, it does not when connected to the APC UPS. It works fine if it's plugged into the mains, if the power is interrupted it starts up again.
 Not only does this happen, but also the UPS won't deliver any power to the PSUs after the power comes back on. As a result I cannot even access iLO.
 In order to get the system to boot up again, I have to disconnect the power cables from the PSUs.
 Any insight would be helpful
 Thanks

 I’m having an issue where some of my endpoints never seem to install the updates from my WSUS server. I have the GPOs setup and 90% of the machines check in and install fine. I have adjusted the GPO so the machines check in every 3 hours to try and force them to download while they are online at some point throughout the day. Previously was set to every 16 hours by the previous guy. 
 I have noticed the GPO was setup to auto download and schedule the install. The schedule install day is everyday and install time set to 10am. 
 Is there a way to get the updates auto install at any time in the day when they are available to the endpoints instead of the set 10am schedule. If a laptop comes online after 10am the updates won’t install until the following day assuming it’s online before that time. 
 Is there also a command I can run to force a machine to check for updates? I have used pswindowsupdate before using PDQ inventory to run a remote powershell command to check and install updates to the endpoints but from my understanding that doesn’t log in the update history under the updates settings tab in Windows. (I may be wrong)
 Appreciate any advice

 I plan on using PFSense's Community Edition installed on a PC but not sure whether to put it behind the router or it should manage the Dual-WAN and then use the LRT224's VPN as is. Which is better? 
 Thank you very much and sorry for the broken grammar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on an RFP to re-fiber my org's main building. We are hub and spoke, with the datacenter in the basement and four closets, one on each of three upper floors with the fourth in an wing off the 1st floor. 
 Previous guy put in multimode fiber to all the IDFs, and it's only OM1. That was over 20 years ago. I'm pushing gigabit over it without issue, but want to go to 10g this year and work towards 25g in the near future, with 100g in the next ten years. So I'm planning to bring in contractors for a rip and replace, out with the multi and in with single mode.
 Question is, how many strands? I know could push 100s of gigs over a single strand, but that is $$$$$ carrier grade stuff... I'm looking for something more in the practical range, so that is duplex LC, or MPO/MTP, for speeds of 25g to 100g based on the Aruba equipment I have right now. 
 Looking at material cost, there's not a big difference between 6 and 12 strands armored plenum rated OS1. This is a fairly small job, short runs (longest is 400 meters). So labor is going to be more expensive than materials by my estimate. Looking at bulk cabling, I also see pre-terminated MPO/MTP 12 strand cable. Paired with fiber tray cassettes that accept MPO and break out into six duplex LC connectors, it seems to make sense for a degree of future proofing. I can use the LC breakout in the short term, and the higher density MPO connection is there for the future. The cassette system also seems nice, I can change the breakout if needed, without having to splice anything new.
 What would the downside of 12 strand be over 6 strand? Is there a downside to MPO vs LC terminations on the cable itself. Is there a downside to a breakout cassette versus spliced terminations?

From my understanding its pretty straightforward with the desktop app as I create a customization and then push the customization file to users devices. Let me know if this is the wrong place to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So im looking to take advantage of the college tuition that my company will pay for, not looking to get anything like bachelor but figure it would be nice to take a fun associate or certificate degree program that could maybe compliment the already 10years of IT experience i already have. It's down to 2, criminal justice or business admin/management as these i can mostly take online but i am open to other suggestions
 One reason being is I am really interested in the cyber seucirty sector of IT, i did get my security+ last year but have yet to land a job in that space. So i figure maybe i could get into forensic data science or similar. And the business administration or management is just a good all around degree to take, and also IT sales is a thing so it could help with that. Im curious what this sub thinks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of an odd question but bear with me for a second.
 Let's say there's a router with three discreet Ethernet ports (each port can be its own network with a different subnet/supernet).
 Now let's say that all of these interfaces/subnets are using non RFC1918 IPs.
 So for example let's say 
  
interface 1 is: 75.168.2.x/24, 
 
interface 2 is 189.54.67.x/24
 
interface 3 is 7.90.85.X/24
 
 If an IP in the Interface 1 subnet sends traffic to an IP in the Interface 2 subnet will the router send that traffic internally between the discreet? Or will it attempt to send that traffic to the real location of that Dst IP?
 In short the router should know that 189.54.67.x/24 is being used for resources internally and the should send it inside rather than out, but with it crossing discreet NICs I wasn't sure.

 I've been asked by a client of mine to create a simple Web form that will be used to log daily work and materials used over the day for a small plumbing company, around 25 staff. Today this is done by filling out a form at the end of the day at the HQ and then the owner copies the papers manually over to Excel - and then he again manually creates invoices from that excel. He probably spends around 10-20 hours a week just doing this which is just bonkers.
 The form part seems simple and straightforward with Jotform for example but I wanted to check if you guys have any recommandations for other platforms that might be more suitable, and perhaps one that is easier to configure to dump the data straight into an Excel sheet with multiple pages/tabswithout going into too much much 3rd party autmation - if that is possible at all.
 Any ideas/thoughts appriaceted.

 This was causing issues since my banking site, mortgage site, and statefarm.com are all doing IP address checks against BrightCloud's database and were not letting me log in.
 I've been pulling my hair out trying to figure out where the source of this issue was. I did thorough scans of all machines in the house for malware. I even blocked all outbound mail ports in my firewall forcing everyone in the house to use webmail. I even went as far as analyzing packets leaving my network looking for any specious traffic that could be construed as phishing, but found nothing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our cyber insurance renewal is coming up, and we are still kind of dealing with the requirements from last year. I am not sure if anyone else has insurance like this, but ours is requiring all administrative accounts to be protected by MFA. This includes:
  
Windows Servers
 Local Admin users
 NAS drives
 Linux
 Backups
 Network (Switches/Firewalls/Vmware etc)
 Along with anything that has any form of admin access, so like door access
  
A good portion of these we've been able to protect with a mixture of native built in MFA, others we've had to do a bit of juggling with the use of jumpboxes, but some of our infrastructure doesn't have native MFA support. 
 I am currently in the process of talking to Duo about a possible solution, they claim they can pretty much MFA up any application. I would assume this is just sales jargon, or is there something I am just missing? I'm seeing documentation mention using a Radius server? This would also require the device/software to also support it? Or can Duo do something magical?

 I've been able to pull down data like Edge name and physical interface status using /getEdge but what would be great is to get the live data diagnostic data too.

 One of our clients has a few hundred streaming devices on their network. They asked if we could help give them a list of these devices, with their host name, IPV6 address, and MAC address, so they can do some forensics on an issue they are tracking. 
 We have the hostnames, and we can get the IPV6 address from there. We also have a list of the MAC addresses, but not coordinated with the hostnames. The devices do NOT have IPV4 addresses. 
 I’ve been trying to Google my way through this, but each hopeful answer I come upon doesn’t seem to work. Mostly they revolve around the “ip -a neigh show” command in some way, all saying that it should provide similar info to “arp -a” for IPV4. I do not, however, see any results that include a previously pinged IPV6 address or hostname. 
 I’m hoping there is another command, or even a different software/utility, I can use. Any help or tips would be appreciated.

The previously setup was a really off brand 1500VA UPS and 120V from the utility outlet in the room. Now, I have a 3000VA 208V ups and PDU in there for the switch gear. These last storms, the no name UPS caused the server to reboot every time it tried to switch to battery, as the batteries are probably lead-acid dust.
 I want to move the Dual PSU dell dervers from that unit to my 208V PDU. Dell appears to not let me use different input voltages across PSUs. WHY?!
 No amount of idrac configs on power configurations let me use the 208V. The green PSU light blinks a few times when connecting 208V power. I don't care if these servers reboot, but from a technical perspective, how could I do a power migration without downtime?
 I see a few dell threads about not being able to use mixed supply voltages, and would like to know if anyone else beat this weird limitation? I have never had a problem with any other vendor using mixed 120V/240V/208V, and this is the first time I am seeing this.

  position : nt-a:xfp:1 diag-avail-status : no-error los : no-los tx-fault : no-tx-fault tx-power : "No Power" rx-power : "-6.12 dBm" tx-bias-current : "0.00 mA" supply-voltage : "3.31 VDC" temperature : "22.00 degrees Celsius" temperature-tca : normal-value voltage-tca : normal-value bias-current-tca : low-alarm-th tx-power-tca : low-alarm-th rx-power-tca : normal-value rssi-profile-id : 65535 rssi-state : disable 
 In the tx-power field it says "No Power" and I have confirmed nothing is being outputted with a light meter. The interfaces are administratively up.
 This is the first time I've worked with any Nokia gear so it's entirely possible I'm missing something basic, but I can't find anything that looks relevant in the command tree.
 Any ideas?

The wifi signal is just not strong enough to run that many devices, especially streaming HD video. We are purchasing the Ethernet adapters for all of our Fire Sticks and will be hard wiring them individually. I will need a total of 2 switches to accomplish this, and have a few questions about compatibility and ease of use. Below is the configuration I will need:
 1 line out of the Nighthawk Router into the first switch. The first switch will feed 4-5 devices and the second switch. The second switch will feed 8-9 devices. All of the devices in question will be Fire Sticks. (I could feed the second switch from another port on the router if that would be a better solution.)
 1) I cannot think of a need for a PoE switch or a managed switch. Is there any reason why I may need one of those or can I use a Smart or Unmanaged Switch?
 2) Are these switches stackable and does my configuration sound correct or require any additional configuration?
 3) Which switches would work best with my specific router?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 What equipment or software do you all use for providing vendor access to your network? We are currently using Global Protect with a series of rules and HIP polices to check a vendor PC for security updates and AV, but I personally do not find this very easy to manage. It also brings up various other security concerns. Our vendors are mapping drives to their PCs and accessing internal web-services only.
 I am thinking of moving towards VM Jump boxes or an actual appliance for remote access. I'm curious what others have in place for a similar scenario.
 Thanks! 
 EDIT:
 This was an inherited process that I am trying to move away from for various reasons as many of you all posted in the comments. We have a few enterprise applications that can only be managed by the vendor. 
 We have LPA enabled with policies in the FW, but it is cumbersome and time consuming. 
 We've been looking at StrongDM, BeyondTrust, and I heard SecureLink out there too. This is the way IMO. So, any input on ZTNA or IAP would be much appreciated.

 The network provider provides free profiles publicly, but specifically advertises that they only support iPhones and not Android. I can add the link to the profile generator if there's no objections from moderators.
 The important parts from the mobileconfig:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typical network design calls for a 3-tier or collapsed-core topology. However, if you have a small datacenter, 2 or 3 racks, with a pair of Nexus core switches with VPC, what are the drawbacks of bringing all endpoints, mainly servers, directly to the core? In the old days, you would put FEX at top of each rack but those are basically line cards and all switching still happens at the core. Let's just imagine that cross-connects are not an issue so you can run cables from whatever devices on each rack directly to the core. With 2 core switches, you can have up to 96+ ports so port capacity should not be an issue. Properly managed, you can limit broadcast domains and access. I've seen arguments regarding TCAM and backplane throughput. Core switches should be non-blocking anyway. What else is there?

 In Cisco documentation, I see little in terms of disabling the interface and why it is on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be an r/sysadmin question, but I figure it's more of a network question because it deals with 802.1X and device authentication:
 Currently wrapping up work on 802.1X authentication for a client and we're using Windows NPS to authenticate MAC addresses for those few devices that either don't have certificate support or are too old to use modern encryption standards (please no comments about how this is bad practice - we know, but we're forced to play the hand we're dealt...)
 For MAC address authentication, this requires creating user objects where both the username and password are the MAC address in question. This works fine.
 However, I'd like to plan ahead and not have to bug the client every quarter to find out which of these MACs aren't needed anymore. Basically, if a device doesn't re-authenticate w/in 7 days, I want to have to manually add it back.
 Even though these MAC addresses are basically AD user accounts, when they're authenticated by NPS, none of their AD properties change, so I can't just poll the last login date. Right now, I'm working on some powershell to scrape 7 days of event logs and remove anything without a successful NPS login. This should work, but I feel like this might be 'hard mode', so to speak. Is there a simpler way I'm not thinking of?

 Hi All,
 Is it possible to somehow allow a user to a specific UNC path through an application (an ERP we provide access to has shared files/folders configured at a UNC path; it's required to be implemented this way through the ERP); however to *NOT* allow the user to navigate to the UNC path via Windows file explorer?
 So, for example, let's say there is a PDF attached in the ERP system for a specific user at path \\server00\folder1\file1.pdf and if the user is within the ERP system, they attempt to access the PDF, it launches whatever the PDF application is and they are able to view the PDF successfully. However, we do not want the user to navigate manually to the path \\server00\folder\file1.pdf as there maybe something within \\server00 that we do not want the user to have access to.
 I can *probably* do individual permissions per user and it will work however...it's over ~400 users and managing that will be a nightmare...
 Ideally, I'd like to turn off UNC path access but allow it through the ERP application access. I know you can turn off UNC access via GPO and I tested this already but then it breaks the access through the ERP application when the user is logged in as well.
 Thanks for any feedback!

In order to prevent attacks like CVE-2023-23397 we want to block all outgoing SMB connections that are not going to private cidr ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0, etc..) entirely, blocking this attack vector for future vulnerabilities like this one. Preferably we would like to use the Windows firewall for this, because we have no control over home routers and blocking these connections from home workers using company laptops. We can however control the Windows firewall rules using powershell on all of our endpoints, but I cant seem to block outbound SMB connections at all. We want to deploy firewall rules using this example powershell:
 New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block SMB connections to public IP subnets" -Direction Outbound -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 139,445 -RemoteAddress "0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255","11.0.0.0-172.15.255.255","172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255","192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255" -Action Block 
 It adds the block rule on top of the list wwith outbound rules, but somehow SMB connections keep working, even if I add our local NAS device to the RemoteAddress list.
  
Windows firewall is enabled
 Rule is present in all profiles
 ChatGPT had no useful tips for me 🫣
  
Anyone know how to do this using Windows firewall?

 We are deploying OpenJDK from Adoptium. No issues there.
 But I want to understand the differences between the various version.
 I understand that it is advisable to install the LTS version. That is fine.
 However, which version?
 If I install version 17. Will it be backwards compatible with apps requiring version 8? Can it break something if I upgrade from version 8 to 17?
 I can install them one next to the other. But what would be the use-case for that? Isn't it cleaner to just keep one version installed?
 For someone that is not familiar with Java, it is very confusing. Hope some of you can shed some light on it. Would be highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI! I'm trying to move a fiber connexion at work from a router port to a switch port so we can remove some redundant legacy router. Here is the the general idea:
 from:
 Provider fiber -> Media converter -> Router -> Switch (access port) -> Firewall cluster vlan interface (via trunk port from switch) 
 to:
 Provider fiber -> Media converter -> Switch (access port) -> Firewall cluster vlan interface (via trunk port from switch) 
 Now when I plug the media converter port to my access port, STP reports port BROKEN for "Shr *TYPE_Inc" so it doesn't work. My understanding is that the other end is trunking and im doing access port so it's expected behavior. 
 Now can someone confirm if I'm understanding this correctly and why this is working fine when connected to a router port? Also works if I skip the switch and plug directly into the port of one of the firewalls in the cluster (probably same reason why it works on router port).
 Switch port config:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/18 description 160-VLAN switchport access vlan 160 switchport mode access speed 100 end 
 Router port config:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 description WAN ip address x.x.x.x 255.255.255.248 ip nat outside speed 100 no negotiation auto 
 What throws me off it when the media converter is plugged to my switch, the other end (what I see as gtw) can ping my firewall interface correctly but I can't ping them (again, that gtw). 
 Thank you!

 Long time lurker and this is my first time posting on here. I am 20M and will be graduating with my BSIT this December. As part of our degree program we are required to complete an internship. I recently received a job offer as an Intern where I will be working directly under a Senior Sys admin. I am a little bit nervous as this is not only my first job in IT but also my first Job in a professional office environment. I really want to do a good job and be a valuable member of the team but I am a little bit unsure what skills/technologies I am expected to be competent in as the job description was quite vague. I feel comfortable with basic stuff like configuring VMs and basic network troubleshooting but I definitely still have a lot to learn. I was wondering if anyone here could give me some advice as to what I should become familiar with before I start in May? What tools/technology’s do sysadmins use daily that would make me stand out if I am familiar with? Any advice anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for any formatting mistakes as I am on mobile. Thank you.

 Does anyone know whether there will be another version of Windows 10 after 22H2? I can't find a yes, or no, anywhere.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information says 22H2 ends on 13 May 2025, buy says nothing about any future releases.
 https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785452/microsoft-windows-10-future-feature-updates-annual-2022 says 14 October 2025, but I don't know where they get that date from.
 https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/microsoft-will-continue-supporting-windows-10-with-yearly-feature-updates/ also says October 2025, but again I don't know where that date comes from. 
 There a few other sites with October 2025 as well.
 So Microsoft says a hard end date for 22H2. But will there be a future release? And where does the October 2025 date come from?
 Any links to sources, especially Microsoft, would be most helpful. Thanks

 I've got the follwoing problem.

 We have a customer who fused with another Company. 
 They are connected via IPSEC and some resources like Ticketing system is only available via Internal IP example: ticket.corp.com -> 10.10.10.10
 Some resources for Marketing and such are hosted in Azure like marketing.corp.com -> 20.30.40.50
 Now.
 ​
 If I create a Zone on my DNS Server which holds corp.com then I need to add all known A records and such, right ?
 Zonetransfer isn't an option since the other corp still has another MSP and they aren't really of the fastest type.

 What would be a good route here ?

 We have a lot of Microsoft Surface devices, most of which I've inherited. I've dealt with the inability to replace the stupid glued-on keyboards, get at the insides or replace cracked screens. I've never understood why, but worked around, that a reinstall of W10 from a standard USB stick doesn't include drivers for the touchscreen, keyboard or mouse and there's only one fucking USB slot on the side. It's your fucking operating system you halfwits and you can't even include basic drivers for your own fucking hardware. I just can't even.
 Today I've taken my first delivery of three Surface Laptop 4 devices. They've got the usual lack of chipset drivers with the new lack of any network drivers whatsoever. Gets better - the only way I can seemingly get Surface drivers from Microsoft is to download a helpful executable or MSI, that then checks whether I'm on a Surface Laptop 4 (spoiler: I'm not) and then refuses to let me have the contents. I can't even "unzip" it as the CABs inside obfuscate the filenames so they're useless.
 FOR FUCKS SAKE MICROSOFT. SORT YOUR SHIT. I'VE BEEN THE GUY QUIETLY STICKING UP FOR YOU SINCE BEFORE YOU SHIPPED THE COMPLETE CLUSTERFUCK THAT WAS WIN95A OR WHEN I HAD TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO ARSE ABOUT WITH GETTING 3.1 ON A NETWORK. I'm tired of having to increasingly try to work around you "making life easier" for me. I'm tired of you renaming and reorganising everything every three months but not updating your documentation. I'm just tired.

 Ideally, the tool should offer central management for creating scheduled tasks, associate each script with a person and description, and run scripts from a central source. We tried Rundeck, but it was too complicated for our needs. 
 Can anyone recommend a free tool that would be suitable for our team size and focus on Windows servers? Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

 I normally do this with my eye's closed but this is an inherited site and there's clearly something different I'm missing! 
 Server 2019.
 Our RDS SSL has expired, and I've got the new cert, added it to IIS on the Gateway. 
 I've then gone into RDS Gateway Manager, saw the warning about the SSL expiry.
 Went into properties, SSL tab, import, imported new certificate.
 Users who have a RDP connection on their desktop working fine.
 Users who use the rdweb connection, login to the site fine, download the RDP file, and - it says the cert is expired. It still shows the old cert in the downloaded RDP file. 
 All my bindings look correct. 
 Unless this server has something else in the mix I'm missing, any ideas why this isn't working?

 Which hypervisor has the best passthrough?
  
A PC failed. Running windows xp connected through USB to some exact measuring large machine and having license usb dongle plugged in the usb.
 A quote came back from the company that installed it and its like 15,000€ for upgrade. This is eastern europe so multiple it by 10.
 Waned to give it a try and move the machine to a VM, and Disk2vhd worked and I am playing with windows xp in a hyperv. 
 But apparently hyperv sucks when it comes to passing through USB. So next try is virtual box or esxi or proxmox/qmeu/kvm,... which with me having vhdx should not be difficult to move to.
 So anyone got some experience with usb passthrough in to VMs that is most reliable? I am thinking that option is also to get some PCIE usb card and that could be passedthrough too, As it works nicely with esxi and HBA cards in IT mode.

My next step is to setup centralized monitoring of network and hardware health. One site has PRTG already but in a half baked setup. Licensing across all these locations can be tricky and slow process due to the countries they are in. I wrote a plan to use Zabbix on all sites and am vetting a few experts to assist now. Does anyone have positive experience or nightmares about Zabbix for such a project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, Wondering if anyone else have seen our scenario last two weeks? We have had 7 situations were the client (Windows server 2019/2022 fully patched, static assigned IP) have deleted it owns A record, much similar with this one (except the windows versions..) https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/dns-host-record-of-a-computer-is-deleted-after-you-change-the-dns-server-assignment-f132a1fe-4867-df2b-a5fc-37557990d518
 The 7 situations have happened in 7 different ADs/VLAN with no connection to each other. DNS Scavaging is configured. The one oddly thing is that all these 7 servers are RD/GW/CB in a RDS farm (not the same farm, we have a farm in each AD/VLAN).
 Extremely weird and frustrating - any ideas? We have enabled DNS Client Events logging on two servers in a VLAN were it has not occurred yet.
 The solution so far has been to simple run "ipconfig /registerdns".

 We had a cowboy work for us a while ago who, somehow, was able to give himself owner permissions to everyones onedrive. Although the account is disabled and poses no risk, the business would like this owner permission removed from everyone's account. We've taking a look at the sharepoint site permissions and can't find where or how he has done this. We know he's applied it to a top level somewhere as new accounts also have him included as the owner permission.
 I've looked everywhere for this bloody permission and I can't find it in the sharepoint admin centre, I'm hoping it's not something that was applied in the old Onedrive admin centre that doesn't exist anymore, if someone can help point me in the right direction that'll be appreciated.
 Cheers

 Apologies if this post meanders.
 I'm mostly network orientated, with a few Cisco certs but I see a lot of network jobs requiring on-call. I'm in my 40's now and just met someone and don't want this on-call stuff now. I have multiple area that I'm interested in, my latest Cisco cert being the DevNet Associate as I'm increasingly becoming more and more interested in a Python orientated job. However, I'm more geared towards using it for automation and DevOps kind of stuff, though I am also learning Django for a possible business idea, and I have an real interest in ML.
 Anyway, back to my original thought, my interest in networking has seriously waned over the last few years and was looking at cloud. I read that AWS is king of cloud platforms, however I also notice that here in the UK, I hardly ever see job requiring AWS, the vast, vast majority want Azure.
 Now I know as far as the customer is concerned, the difference between them at first glance is mostly aesthetic; different interface etc.
 Given that I really like working with Python, rather than Powershell, what would be a better option between AWS and Azure?

 I look at the GPO, and it looks correct. I look at the registry settings, and they make sense.
 Yet, on each scheduled evening of updates, nothing happens.
 Where have I gone wrong? Someone put me out of manual update hell!
 Mixture of Windows Server 2016 and 2019 servers. 47 servers in total, not getting updates on any of them :(
 No WSUS, direct to MS.
 Settings are:
  
Common GPO applied to all servers
 Example GPO applying updates per group of servers
 gpresult /h on a server, showing settings applied
 Resultant registry at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU
 Pastebin of Windows Updates logs. Was scheduled for 23:00, this is the closest set of logs thereafter
  
I've done a set of updates manually since applying the above settings. I've rebooted. I've checked the Windows Update service is running. There are updates waiting to be installed.
 Driving me mad.

 Hope you are having a chill day. 
 I was stupid enough to map a server to multiple users using a script that is placed in the startup folder.
 Now the time for migration has come and a new server has to be mapped instead of the old one.
 The new server is being mapped through the active directory using a script as well but they are interfering with each other.
 I use AD because I don't have access to policies. 
 What would be your best way of removing a script from multiple users' startup folders, without manually doing it on each laptop? 
 Thanks to all in advance.

 The past few months I've been elbow deep in Teams Calling and Intune MDM configuration.
 There seems to be alot of missing functionality missing, for example, in a Teams Auto Attended configuration, if a caller doesn't press a number for an option, Teams will just drop the call instead of having an option to push the call to a call queue. What if someone has accessibility problems that don't allow them to press or speak a number?
 For Intune, when you enrolled a device that is set to join a dynamic group based on the enrolment profile name, the initial configuration policy won't apply, as the dynamic rules aren't processed fast enough. 
 Surely a global billion dollar company would have the ability to plan the development scope and functionality testing.
 It's ironic how they are trying to force you to thier cloud offerings but can't even flesh these products out fully.
 Rant over.

 Does anyone know how to add a product image/photo to an inventory SKU label? I have been playing around with Dymo Connect, Zebra Designer on Microsoft and the Avery Design & Print website. Using the database function I can create unique SKU labels with OEM automative part numbers, SKU barcodes and qr codes to URLs from an excel spreadsheet.
 I can also add numerical counters to these functions. Making them sequential off the excel cell data which represents each donor vehicles individual ID number.
 What I would love is to add a product image to the label which is also the first image on the eBay listing.
 I can't seem to embed any images into the excel cell. All 3 label making softwares are reading the image from the database as text and displaying 'picture' instead of the image.
 I can manually add images to each label but it will take way too long. I would much prefer the images automatically generate onto each new label as the barcodes and other data does.
 Can anyone help me out or point me in the right direction?
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my team is looking for an alternative to VMware since they changed their licensing model, which will enormously increase our operational costs. So I am currently researching alternatives. I have zero experience with other virtualization solutions, but am pretty proficient in the VMware products (even hold a cert). So I hope a lot of the concepts are transferable to other vendors.
 The thing is: My research mostly led me to Proxmox or Hyper-V, for example, in home labs or rather small environments. Our environment is fairly large tho (about 200 hosts), so I am wondering, if solutions like the aforementioned are even scaleable to such an environment. Does anyone have any experiences with alternative virtualization products (HyperV, KVM, Proxmox, Nutanix, Citrix) on an industrial scale and can point me in a recommendable direction?

 I have Device A (a camera) connected to port 1 and Device B (my PC) connected to port 2. Device A was statically configured with an incorrect IP, where as Device B has an IP that falls within my network.
 On Device B I am able to discover Device A. I'm assuming this is done through multicast, but if both devices are in separate networks, and Device A doesn't even have a gateway, how is it possible that there's discovery?

 I'm a sys admin troubleshooting a PXE server on one of my networks. Our service desk team is having issues using MDT to provision client computers (We are unable to use MECM / Intune for these at this time). Anyway, the long and short of it is that some workstations are able to contact the MDT server and others aren't. The ones that aren't are still able to contact the DHCP server located in the same subnet. Workstations receive an IP address, and then a message stating that "No boot offers were received."
 Here's a brief overview of this network:
 Workstations connected to CISCO L2 edge switches scattered across the building.
 CISCO Edge switches connected to CISCO two core routers in HSRP
 Core Routers connect to a juniper SRX firewall

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's discuss IT certifications!
 When I was going through college I had the A+, Net+, Sec+, CCNA, etc.
 This put me ahead of the other applicants. It helped me get into some good jobs. 
 Now a decade later...
 Recently I've got 3 certifications. They haven't done shit for me. It's good to show I still learn.
 I was going for the CCNP-ENT, then CISSP, DC, SEC, etc.
 But in reality, nobody cares. They only care about experience after so many years it seems. 
 Half the guys we interview with CCNP can't explain what a VLAN is and what it does. It really gives IT certifications a bad name. I used to love them, but have decided to learn programming python and network automation instead. Maybe I'll get a cert in the future, maybe not. 
 You have to keep renewing them too. That's a huge pain in the ass. At least Cisco let's you learn new material and get those certifications updated. 
 In summary I think certifications are great to get you in and if your company requires it and pays for it plus a raise. Otherwise I think if you have a decade or more of experience it is useless. 
 What your your thoughts?

 We want to take everyone off SMS mfa and only have them with password less mfa that shows location and app. 
 The problem is that a lot of people are using legacy mfa from the o365 portal and have registered their cell phone as a auth method. 
 I would like to turn that off as a option as a registration method, but I am afraid if I go into the legacy mfa portal and turn off phone method , it will lock people out. So, I am afraid I will have to reach out to each user and ask them to registration their auth method as Microsoft authenticator before turning off legacy auth and moving over to the new Azure authentication gui.
 Is there an easier way , to go about this migration?
 If I turn off phone registration as a option in legacy mfa portal in o365 , is there a possibility it would only be forward facing for new users, and people who still have SMS auth will still be able to sign in to m365 services ?
 Again, we want the only option as a registration method to be passwordless mfa with Microsoft authenticator .

I've gotten by by reverse engineering most the stuff so far, but any issues with the loop and it's over my head. 
 My problem, I know almost nothing when it comes to electricity. It's black magic to me. I know AC & DC exist, but I wouldn't be able to explain the difference beyond "hey, this is an AC wall outlet, and this is a battery powered device." Don't know how to use a multi-meter. Not sure how loops work. Not sure what polarity & reverse polarity is or how it works. Relays? Been hearing that a lot. I could point one out to you but couldn't tell you what it does. Normally open? Normally closed? Both are normally over my head. Voltage? Wattage? Amperage? You get the point. 
 I pretty much just want some resource suggestions that can help me form a solid foundation from the ground up. Starting from the most basics of basic that you'd teach a kid to some of the more advanced stuff that'd I'd need to know if I decided to be an amateur low voltage tech.

 After replacing the network card thinking it was faulty, we tried on a basic $80 TP-link switch and it works fine. I can also connect that switch to the main switch and now it all works fine - except can someone explain specifically what's happening between these two devices? 
 Trying to work out if best to replace the switch, or if its the network card that is problematic, but I can't work out which is causing it. 
 Thanks.

 The worst part of being a sys admin, knowing your colleague will be fired before they do.
 Every time one of my coworkers, either in IT or not are about to be fired and I am made aware of it days in advance, it makes me nearly have a breakdown. We are a fairly small company, less than 200 people so I know everyone. On top of that, we are an even leaner IT team. Everyone but myself has a specialized role. I am a tweener that works between our SQL, Application and Infrastructure teams. I was made aware that my coworker who is the only other sysadmin in the company is being terminated over the next few days. I am sick to my stomach and the only saving grace is that my neck isn’t on the line. I am generally ok removing access once I get the word but I get in my own head leading up to it.
 How do you do it or am I just too soft?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 ​
 Beyond DNAC, we're starting to look at what Cisco has suggested for replacing SNMP for Wireless client monitoring, the YANG model stuff and using the telemetry subscriptions to retrieve/store and graph data. In full disclosure, we've had some internal talks with Cisco and have built a few prototypes using this great tutorial as a guide:
 ​
 https://www.wifireference.com/2020/01/14/viewing-network-telemetry-from-the-catalyst-9800-with-grafana/
 ​
 ​
 I've built this on a prototype and had a group with a lot more programming chops build the infrastructure and I'm getting to the point where the controller (for whatever reason) decides to close the connection and never re-establishes until I remove the config and re-add it (most likely just the receiver bit):
 test-9800-wlc-01#sh telemetry ietf subscription 30 re
 Telemetry subscription receivers detail:
 ​
 Subscription ID: 30
 Address: 1.1.1.1
 Port: 57000
 Protocol: grpc-tcp
 Profile:
 Connection: 12543
 State: Disconnected
 Explanation: Unknown reason
 ​
 This is the one subscription (I'd love to get 2-3 but I can't get one data set stable):
 ​
 telemetry ietf subscription 30
 encoding encode-kvgpb
 filter xpath /wireless-client-oper:client-oper-data/common-oper-data
 source-address 2.2.2.2
 stream yang-push
 update-policy periodic 6000
 receiver ip address 1.1.1.1 57000 protocol grpc-tcp
 ​
 (I redacted info - apologies if i inadvertently removed anything). I have confirmed through a packet capture that the data is not leaving the controller.
 ​
 Has anyone else run into these issues? I really hate to get to the point where every 4-6 hours I go in and re-issue the configs but I feel like we're stuck here. I have two controllers - one running 17.3.5(b) with non 6e APs and I'm going to try it on my 17.9.2 controller running minimal 6e APs. I'm wondering if it's load related.
 ​
 I do have a Cisco TAC case but since it's not a P1/P2, it's best effort with an already overloaded TACc team.

 So tomorrow by EOD our team will be submitting the budget for next year as fiscal year is about to come to end. I have been eyeing at netbox but our leadership insisted that we need active support for the NRM tool as we are already thinned out in our daily tasks, weekly, monthly and quarterly activities along with mitigation activities whenever security team highlights any issues on the network end.
 Our infra consists of fortigate fw, analyzer, nexus switched , a bunch of l2, l3 catalyst switches , along with idrac, vsphares and shit tonn of vms and LBs . We maintain all this data mostly on Excel which i and many of our team find very tedious and prone to errors. Recently our security team has brought in axonious but it's under their domain and from DC ops team perspective we are left with poorly maintained Excel sheets. I am hoping to get some decent suggestions for NRM tool with licence which can make our lives easier by maintaining all the data in proper nrm tool which also provides ipam support .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About 5 years ago I set up a small network for a restaurant in the Caribbean. They wanted some IP cameras, a POS system and a slot machine server installed. I used an inexpensive Netgear router, an unmanaged POE switch and an LTE box for internet. All cabling was Cat 5e. A year later they wanted to add a guest network for the adjacent hotel. I set this up, but used a completely separate network infrastructure. I used ubiquity APs due to budget constraints. My thought at the time was by separating the two networks, it would keep the business network bandwidth more secure and wouldn’t bog down the cameras with the guest network traffic. 
 Currently the business is expanding, adding several more buildings to the property, creating a campus like environment. They want Internet and cameras on all these new buildings. Since I have these two separate networks, I’m starting to realize that it’s going to be much more expensive and redundant putting two sets of switches for every building. Also a couple of the buildings are across a road with very rocky soil. Max distance between buildings is about 110 feet. I want to know the best way to proceed with this project. I have a few questions:
 1) How are networks designed for say college campuses or hotels with several buildings when it comes to critical networks and simple Wi-Fi? Do they separate things?
 2) Is there any reason to keep the two networks separate in my case.
 3) What is the best way to segregate the network traffic, forming a more secure, prioritized network for the POS and camera, and a less secure network for guest WIFI?
 4) I want to use fiber to span the buildings, but If I am forced to use PTP wireless bridges (due to very rocky soil), can I use one PTP bridge to support 2 vlans?
 Thank you in advance for your help. As I am still a novice at this, problems like this are a great way to learn about this industry.

 How would you go about validating with offices had only one router versus which ones had two or more routers? What tool would look into subnets and subnet masks to determine what connects where? And would that tool identify Ethernet wAN interfaces and their connectivity?
 I know redundancy and diversity are different animals. What would correlate circuits from different vendors, or would you relay on ifdescr field?
 And how would you validate that traffic that normally goes over an MPLS circuit would take an alternate path in a failure?

We’ve created workarounds to alleviate the tediousness of this but I’m still baffled at my bosses approach. 
 When I ask why we can’t attach the SP to the file explorer my boss just says “it’s a security risk” without any explanation! I’ve tried looking this up but can’t seem to find any concrete explanation as to why it would be a security risk. Is this an SMB issue that I’m not aware of ? Any insight is appreciated. Thanks.

 How do you appropriately move it?
 Things I've tried in the past:
  
Recycled other leftover boxes that have not been thrown away yet. Spare boxes are not always guaranteed to be available.
 Placed equipment in spare static bags. Static bags are easy to stock up. They provide protection from the elements. However, when stacking 2 or more devices in static bags they tend to slide around and are in danger of falling off the cart.
 Simply carry it under my arm or on a cart and walked down the street. This feels very wrong and unprofessional. My location gets a log of rainfall so this is not always feasible. Equipment is in danger of sliding off the cart or being dropped if I trip over a curb.
  
I know rule#1 is always use a company vehicle for insurance reasons, but what are the other rules you follow to ensure equipment is relocated safely?
 I'm considering something like this https://tripplite.eaton.com/4u-server-shipping-case~SRCASE4U to my boss since it seems like a good low-cost solution, but wanted to get other opinions.

 I've been having a lot of cable issues recently and one of my network administrators constantly has to keep going on site to fix a time clock issue that only happens at the far end of a run in its intended location (Kitchen). The problem I have is that our Telecom team will not fix issues if we cannot show fault with cable which we are currently limited to physical inspection, troubleshooting by testing a variety of devices, or cable diagnostics on switch.
 I will include the situation I am currently facing just in case I am missing something:
 The mentioned time clock will work on the same port with a jumper cable with no failures.
 The time clock will work fine on other parts of the same site. (Lounge, Office, Etc.)
 The time clock will freeze at random intervals. (Mostly within 1 weeks time)
 Switch has same config as all other time clocks on site.
 I thank you all in advance for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, we are moving to Extreme and going to be taking advantage of their fabric tech for our new multi campus network. We are coming from a stable and reasonably complicated network with IP routing to the access layer and separate VLANs and subnets on every switch for distinct devices types. 
 We are looking at ways we can build upon our existing design and stability but take advantage of features that fabric that mean we can change the design to suit each system. One thing that interests me is the possibility to move back to having L2 segments spanned across the entire estate and assigning a /24 subnet for a particular system such as CCTV. We can then give the service owner the /24 and tell them wherever they install their devices they will sit on the same subnet and if the system doesn't work they can't complain about devices not working over L3 when communicating with each other etc. 
 One of the problems with this approach is deciding where to put the gateways, what to push to the firewall or to keep on the core. We were looking at pushing critical devices gateway to our firewall for most control but also I am wondering about VRFs/segments and controlling traffic with routing rather than just spanning L2 to our firewall?
 Any advice or tips appreciated on how to best take advantage of fabric without making a mess. Cheers!

 for those not privy with Dell dock issues, it seems the docks get out of sync and think the laptop is off when it is in fact ON. so you get "No Signal" on your screens.
 easy enough unplug, shut down, close lid, plug in and from dock power on. boom they are in sync and all is working well, until next Tuesday when it happens again. I get parts of Missouri have shite infrastructure, maybe we have power blips but, they are all on UPS. 
 Even if they weren't the firmware should be smart enough to figure out it's out of sync.
 I ran through Dells support and they suggested RMA and asked if they meant all 72 docks, they said yes. I told them need one heel of a truck and pallet, they assured me they have an RMA team for this.
 Talk about wasting their own money! (I asked for an escalation)

 I have 4 accounts that need to be migrated from GoDaddy’s 365 to a normal Microsoft 365 account. 
 3 of these accounts will be converted to shared inboxes, because the client was using generic accounts like “service” or “scheduling” that multiple users would log into. 1 of these accounts is for the owner.
 I’ve seen the bittitan and migrationwiz ways to migrate, but I am wondering if I could just simply backup the mailboxes to a pst from GoDaddy since there are only 4 of them, and just upload the pst to the new Microsoft accounts I’ve created and licensed. 
 Once I do this, can I delete the 365 plan from GoDaddy, and then the tenant would automatically be released so I can change the mx records to point at the new Microsoft account, or would I have to contact Godaddy to release them?
 If they have onedrive documents, I am assuming I would also have to backup those. 
 TLDR: I am just wondering if there is an easier way to do the GoDaddy 365 to Microsoft 365 migration if I only have 4 user accounts, and 3 of those will be converted to shared mailboxes.

 With that said, should the command still be applied to the unused port since it is an access port? The reason I ask if a lot of the findngs will say something like "all user/host facing access ports", but this one specifically says "all access ports".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Context: We have a Wi-Fi network called CBNet that is set to auto-connect to Chromebooks under our domain, and it is a hidden network.
 ​
 We have two Dell 3100 Chromebooks and one Dell 3100 2 in 1 Chromebook that we sent out to a company called "ITurity" for repair. The company swapped the motherboard in all the Chromebooks with another. To get the motherboard to sync with the Chromebook, they entered Dev Mode and switched the serial number to match the original Chromebook.
 When we got them back, it prompted us to re-enroll them, so we did. Now, the Chromebooks all have the same issue. When using wireless, it does not auto connect like it is supposed to. You can manually enter the CBNet Wi-Fi and password and use the Chromebook, but once you power off an on again, it doesn't auto-connect (although you can still click on the network and connect because the SSID and password are saved.
 We called the company, and they said that it is not an issue they've had, and they bought their motherboards from different manufacturers for the 3100 and 3100 2 in 1. We have tried an OS recovery, but we can't powerwash because we had it disabled in the Admin Console (it still appears to be disabled). We also can't powerwash through the console. It shows the last activity on the Chromebooks as months ago. When connected to the network with an ethernet to USB adapter, you can login to the Chromebook and use it.
 We have tried manually connecting to other Wi-Fi's, and that works the same as with CBNet. The only difference is that when connecting to the CBNet network, there is an exclamation point to the bottom right of the Wi-Fi symbol.

 Any help would be appreciated!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been a contractor to the Fed'l government since 1992. I have a ton of experience dealing with all sorts of hardware, software, peripherals, etc. With the contracting world there comes times when you must job hop for one reason or another. Mostly I only hop when my contract is coming to an end and the current company hasn't been able to place me on another contract. So that means that I have to interview all over again, which I don't mind. The part that I do mind is having some cocky kid ask the most asininely questions to me during an interview about my skills or background. I'm not sure whether they are meaning to be asses to show their worth to their boss and use me as their example or if they genuinely do not know how to do an interview. For example, only a few years ago I had this guy ask me what I would do if a user reported they were having an issue while printing. Seriously??? A freaking printer problem?? That's Tier 1, at best, and I'm Tier 2/3 my entire career since about 1995 and this guy asks me about a printer issue and how I would resolve it?
 So, what's the most assinine thing you've been asked during an interview as part of your experience?

 I've spent over 10 years in IT as a software developer but still feel like a mid-level developer who is quite far from being a professional senior software developer. To be honest, I don't see any motivation to grow because, in every company I've worked for, I've encountered demotivating things like not paying attention to legacy code, lack of clean code practices, teammates with high ego but low empathy, a lot of talks but lack of documentation and self-explanatory code, etc. For me, this is not about software development but more about corporate processes where I don't see a good place for myself.

 I’m convinced that years ago you could configure an APC UPS not to provide power to connected devices until the batteries had recharged to a certain percentage, thus preventing pc/server power on and shutting down straight away if the mains power went off again within minutes. 
 Any help would be appreciated.

 I have come across this page:

 But I cannot use it because its for 365 apps only, which again from what I have been and what I read months ago it won't work with Business Standard. 
 Does anyone have a better solution to getting Teams from auto-starting other than uninstalling it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to understand something. My company is trying to migrate an on-premise ERP (Sage 300) to the cloud. We were advised by Sage's business partner in my country to set up a cloud instance with 16 GB of RAM, 4CPUs and 120GB SSD storage which we did. However, we logged in four simultaneous users and it seemed to be a bit sluggish. Given that during normal business operations, we'll have more than 10 simultaneous users logged in, this didn't seem like a good fit. Now, the confusion is this, the business partner had asked for a lot of money to set the server up. They say that there is a way you set up the server so that it becomes faster, he even mentioned that he has a server with the same specs handling more than 18 simultaneous users logged and working seemlessly. The question is, what is this "way" they are talking about? From my understanding the steps of setting up a server are pretty standard, I mean, chose the package (In my case AWS Lightsail) and then launch it. Are there any tips and tricks I am missing? A new installation I believe doesn't come with heavy and buggy software that would slow down the server. Oh, the operating system in question is Windows Server 2016.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago one of our APC broke down, and I ordered a replacement. In the meantime, half of the physical infrastructure is directly plugged into the wall, which is not ideal.
 We are running a 3 nodes VMware infrastructure with 2 SANs and one of the impacted devices that was previously plugged into the failing APC is a core switch that is dedicated to storage, so basically directly plugged to both SANs and 3 nodes. The switch itself is member of a stack, but with only two members (one commander and one standby) which means both switches are actually active, so I cannot simply unplug it or it might cause outages and it's especially dangerous with the storage for our VMs. 
 My question is : what would be your approach to unplug that switch with minimal impact for the end user ? Is there a way from vCenter to pause the infrastructure easily, and resume, and will that be enough to safely unplug the switch ? 
 I don't have much knowledge and I'm the sole IT for a medium size company, and I have no experience dealing with this. 
 Pausing the infrastructure is acceptable for a short timespan but I want to make sure that I am doing everything that is needed to ensure that no Vm integrity is at risk.

The dent was small (~3mm long, width like the cable itself, depth ~1mm) and the cable came back to it's normal shape after few minutes but I'm still wondering if I should buy a new one - because I know it's a fragile thing. Beside the dent, there was no other visible damage and I don't have a way to test the cable - I can either keep it and pray it will work or buy a new one and try to replace it before we will finish the wall. I know it's difficult/impossible to determine the damage by a description and a "text drawing" - I just hope to find someone who maybe had a similar experience and can share his/her expertise. For few minutes the cable looked like this:

 I'm confused to what dictates the forest functional level.
 We have a lot of servers in our estate (100+), where there still a couple of 2008 R2 VMs kicking about, that we are in the progress of decommissioning and moving onto 2022. I've recently inherited the setup here so trying to get all sorted and all up to 2019 / 2022.
 Our domain functional level is 2012 R2 as we still have 1 2012 R2 DC that's due to be replaced with 2022 in the coming months, but I've noticed our forest level is showing 2008 R2. I decommissioned a 2008 R2 DC yesterday, and increased the functional level to 2012 R2. Is that because of the 2008 R2 servers kicking about still or is it likely still updating in the background?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, We're having a strange issue where we can't use RDS on any of our servers except for the RD Connection Broker itself. We get the following error:
 The Server pool does not match the RD Connection Brokers that are in it. Errors:
  
Cannot connect to any of the specified RD Connection Broker Servers. Ensure that at least one server is available and that the Remote Destop Management (rdms), RD Connection Broker (tssdis), or RemoteAPP and Desktop Connection (tscpubrpc) services are running.
 ServerName.Domain.Local
  
I have tried logging into the RDS database, and took it offline and back online - this made no change. I've tried using Server Manager on other servers and connecting to the RDS broker but I get the same issue. It seems to be a problem with the RDS Broker server allowing connections from other servers. Does anyone have any ideas?

 The Technical Element
 Design for change
 - The old google mantra is right. Design for change. Change is having to deploy new software, upgrade existing software, scaling, equipment breaking, and people shifting around.
 - Everything in this mantra is about finding balance. You might think it's a good idea to tightly marry your system to a particular OS or Linux distro. It's just as bad of an idea to separately them entirely. Use layers and a _little_ indirection if you must.
 - This does not mean complete and total platform agnostics. It's about making one system two, two systems twenty. Dealing if a sysadmin gets hit by a bus, if that dangling harddrive dies, if someone runs rm -rf /. It's for the incremental changes. Security update…]]></summary>

 The device is authenticated to WiFi using its own device certificate, but once the user logs in, authentication is handed over to the user. Since the user has never logged in, they haven't requested a certificate from the CA, so it therefor can't connect. 
 The only way around this is for them to login for the first time while connected to ethernet, and do a "gpupdate /target:user /force" which carries out the user's CSR and certificate issue process. Not ideal. 
 Anyone got an idea on how to work around this, besides stopping user-handoff all together?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Morning,
 I’m working on syncing Teams documents to devices via OneDrive for business, allowing end users to be able to access the files within File Explorer on Windows 10.
 I’m having some issues with file path lengths and hoping someone could steer me in the right direction.
 In article 1 is says "SharePoint Online and OneDrive have a 256-character limit on Windows PCs. If you exceed the character limit, you receive an error message when you try to do anything within the synchronized document libraries, like creating folders or renaming documents."
 However, in article 2 it says it can be up to 520. Is anyone able to advise on what the source of truth is please? Additional information at the bottom if you have questions.
 Article 1 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/change-address-contact-and-more?view=o365-worldwide
 Article 2 - https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa
 Why am I doing this? – The organisation name is really long and it significantly cutting into the file character limit count
 Have you tested this? – Yes I have and I’m getting stuck at 256/260 characters. However, this could be down to the ‘long file paths’ setting, which I am struggling to get working. I don’t want to further troubleshoot the ‘long file paths’ not working correctly if it’s not going to be supported in the first place.
 Kind Regards,
 Max

The email was one of those typical ones where the actor reaches out to say they have an urgent task for an employee. The FROM email address is the real email address of the manager though and there is not a alternate "Return Address" header so a reply would go directly to the manager. (The manager's account has been checked and is definitely not compromised).
 From the headers I can see that the email originated from a goDaddy server and that the SPF check passed on that basis. My gut feeling here is that someone is "playing" with one of goDaddy' servers here which is why there is no "Return Address" set.

 The issue is that the script is too slow to work on an environment of our scale. We have 37k mailboxes and receive almost a million emails each day.
 At two minutes a mailbox, the time to process would be 50 days.
 They provide removing throttling for OnPrim and completely ignore Online. Has anyone used this script to process a large environment?
 I've tried things like grabbing the mailbox statistics and ignoring any that haven't been active recently, but that's still in the tens of thousands.

 Just got hired at a startup as the first in-house IT hire. The company previously worked with a contractor who worked after hours, and needless to say, didn’t put much effort into doing things the right way here…he never had anyone to check his work! Anyways, the company has been using Google Drive as their corporate file system for its first couple of years and I’ve been tasked with cleaning it up and setting it up as a traditional file system used in corporate environments…
 So just wanted to see how other companies are using Google Drive and how other sys admins are setting it up? For context, there are hundreds of thousands of existing files, permissions are a mess, and no department is open to restructuring lol. What’s the best way to rip off the band-aid here and use it as efficiently as possible?
 Thanks!

 Environment is Office 365 E3. No third-party email filtering.
 In the past week I have been receiving a lot of false positive SPAM emails. Internal emails and Microsoft emails are ending up as SPAM and going to junk. Customer emails as well. We also noticed we cannot invite more than 10 customers to meeting.
 It is even impacting systems where we allow spoofing and impersonation such as our SAP system. Those are also going to Junk.
 I have a Premier Support ticket opened, but so far it is not resolved.
 My though is Microsoft turned up their filtering in response to Outlook zero-day (CVE-2023-23397).
 Has anyone else noticed this recent uptick in false positives?

 We have Meraki SD-WAN, switching and wireless at the moment. We are backhauling all traffic from branch sites back to a Meraki VPN concentrator in our DC and breaking out to the internet via Fortigate firewalls. We are in the process of migrating most of our on-premises server infrastructure and services to public cloud and eventually there may not be a need for an on-prem DC firewall.
 I've been tasked with coming up with a plan to locally breakout traffic at branch sites. Personally, the UTM/NGFW capabilities on the Meraki's are rubbish and nowhere near Enterprise grade compared to what we have with Fortigates. The logging and overall visibility is extremely limited compared to FortiAnalyzer as well.
 I've started looking into SASE solutions. The easiest to integrate with our existing Meraki kit is Cisco Umbrella. However, Cisco does not have an Umbrella PoP here in New Zealand so I would be forced to tunnel all traffic to Australia (Sydney or Melbourne) which is a dealbreaker. From past experiences and aside from concerns with reliability, this would not work for us with websites getting geo IP redirected to Australian sites, sensitive sites such as banking, etc.
 I'm interested to know your experiences with any of the below which I've identified as having a local PoP here in New Zealand.
 Zscaler
 Palo Alto Prisma
 Cloudflare
 Cato Networks
 Netskope
 It's a bit hard as you can imagine to read past the marketing fluff and gimmicks to know how these products truly perform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 My mother is opening a restaurant and needs some help with setting up a network for the business. I'm an IT professional with a focus on Azure/AWS security & compliance. While I have some networking experience in my homelab, I'm seeking some guidance because of some key constraints that I have to navigate.
 Here are the requirements:
  
One subnet for a POS system called Toast. This subnet is highly managed by the vendor. No "unauthorized devices" can be connected to this subnet. The vendor provides a Meraki Z3 router and an unmanaged switch. Downstream from those, there'll be two receipt printers, three POS kiosks, and a cash drawer. Endpoints on this subnet will be hardwired. No wireless.
 One subnet for all non-POS equipment. For this, I'm planning on purchasing a Meraki Go Router Firewall and a Meraki Go Access Point. Endpoints on this network will all be wireless. No hardwired. 
  
We'll have five static IP addresses available. The kicker is that Toast POS explicitly forbids the presence of an intermediate device between the ISP's gateway and their router. Normally, I'd put a router firewall in front of the Toast POS router and isolate it on its own VLAN. Since I can't do that, I'm not quite sure how to create two subnets while meeting the POS requirements. Is it possible to connect both routers directly to the gateway, assign a static IP to each, and isolate the traffic on the gateway? I suppose that will depend on the capabilities of the gateway device. Comcast hasn't told me what unit we'll be getting yet. 
 Just looking for some guidance here. Thanks!

 My question is, is it possible to reach out to the Carrier or manufacture of the phones to have them unlocked? Right now, we have a box with more on the way and it seems they are all just fancy paper weights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've been struggling recently on making up a (what should be) simple network topology. Link is here: https://imgur.com/a/unD88qC
 For background: 1. I want PC 1, 2, and 4 to be able to talk to each other 2. All PCs within their own boundary should be able to talk to the other PCs within that boundary only (with the exception of above)
  
I can not modify the IP addresses already assigned (everything is on a 192.168.1.0/24). I can change the gateways.
 
I can not modify the switch attached to 1.50 and 1.75, assume its an out-of-box L2 switch
 
 I'd like to use ACLs to complete this by controlling the outgoing traffic from each layer 3 switch. (i.e Fa0/4 with an out ACL to stop PC5 from reaching outside its boundary).
 To my understanding one (of many) would look like (middle switch):
 interface FastEthernet0/10
 ip access-group TO_NORTH out
 !
 ...
 ip access-list extended TO_NORTH
 permit ip host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.1.50
 permit ip host 192.168.1.1 host 192.168.1.50
 !
 I recognize there's an implicit deny at the bottom, that should cover anything not listed from "leaving" the "boundary". After I apply this ACL to the port, for some reason all traffic no matter the source or destination still passes through that switch, port, and ACL as if it was never applied.
 ​
 I think i've dug my mind into a rabbit's hole and have confused myself over what I believe should be rather easy. Do I need to have routing enabled or GW set somewhere specific? 
 if there's any more info i can provide, lmk
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I have a NetBox server with 2 CPUs and 8GB of RAM. It also runs a webhook handler specific to NetBox. These webhooks will make basic changes via Ansible, like update a port description or change a port's mode based on updates to interfaces. However, there have been times where I've tried to update 10+ interfaces at a time, which will then cause the webhook handler to take on 10 webhooks/execute 10 scripts at the same time. This seems to spike CPU usage for varying amounts of time, depending on the number of interfaces I attempted to update. The spike causes the VM console to freeze up and often causes some of the webhooks to not execute properly.
 I'm just curious if anyone else is using their NetBox server as a webhook handler, and if so, what specs it's deployed with to get it to work smoothly. I made a post in r/Netbox, but figured I'd add it here as well for exposure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 My company has recently gotten a Cisco C1101 Integrated Services Router to sub-divide our currently flat network. I have used routers before I have used switches before but not an “L3 Switch” as this is known as. Interface g0/0/0 is the L3 “WAN” and g0/1/0~3 are L2 “LAN” ports. I literally just want this to act as a router between the company firewall and our domain controller but I can’t for the life of me get it sorted. What I’ve done so far is create two VLANs that are assigned to two ports each example VLAN 20 is on g0/1/0-1 , VLAN 30 is on g0/1/2-3 This is only a 4port switch plus the WAN port. I assume I need to do PAT on the device but am struggling. Any advice at all is much appreciated, I will answer whatever questions you got for me to the best of my ability. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this fits here, but it's a thing that happens mainly at work so ehh, mods can decide.
 Basically I'm wondering how you guys manage forgetting things. I'm a desktop guy at a small org, doing everything from help desk to server work. Intune management, laptop, phone setup, on off boarding, printer management, paper refilling, swipe card setup, desk relocations, visitor queries, water cooler repairs, the whole shebang.
 I have real problems with getting busy and forgetting what I was doing and I'm wondering how to manage this.
 I had a user ask me to do something, and between walking from one end of the office back to my desk and sitting down, I'd forgotten what it was was sitting down to do and proceeded to instead do the other two things I got asked about on the way. Sometimes I'll read an email and go to action it then forget what I was doing halfway through, or answer a question and then forget about the email completely. 
 It's this kind of forgetfulness that keeps getting me in trouble with the boss. How do you guys manage this when you run into it? I have rules on my inbox to flag emails as they come in now, as well as a task planner in teams, but I still keep running into these issues whenever I get busy.
 I've mentioned it to my boss before, but short of moving to paid overtime to clear my to do list I'm not sure what I can do. I'm one of the lowest salaried staff at my org from what I understand, but I can't move jobs because I otherwise like my job and can't do things like that in my life (if someone had a gun to my head and told me to move jobs or stand up for myself I'd just take the bullet)
 Anyway input on how to not forget things would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am going through CCNA Training and have hit a spot that is extremely hard to wrap my brain around. I know I need to know it for the test, but how many Network Admins out there use IPv6 for their internal networks or even Router to Router connections? This reminds me of the Microsoft MCSE test questions about linking a server from New York to Tokio to Berlin, that 90% of us never used, yet was somehow 50% of the study guide and questions.

I have ~600 users and 2 facilities to manage with only 1 other person on the team, providing 24/7 support. I was told there would be a scheduled rotation for on call but they keep stringing that along and I get called back in at least 2x per week. I am also expected to check my emails and reply 24/7. 
 I have another offer in hand, relatively same pay, better benefits, and a promising culture. Is having a 3 month stint on your resume that bad? I'd also feel bad for getting trained up and then leaving almost immediately, but I refuse to work somewhere that values their employees so little.

 Anecdotally, I've read some people saying that companies are starting to think about moving back to on-premises for company servers to reduce cost.
 Is this actually starting to happen in a big way? Does this mean that there might be increasing demand for people that understand infrastructure and networking again because cloud infrastructure is getting too expensive?

 I got some really good words, camaraderie, and advice from this community. I had already been taking some responsibility on our Azure defender for cloud solution, and I'm happy to report that my boss supports me jumping in with both feet and getting more on the security side of our operations. 
 This has reinvigorated me within IT. I have already completed the AZ-500 coursework, and have the cert scheduled for next week. I have not failed a single practice test yet. The stuff just makes sense to me, it clicks. Then I plan on pursuing the SC-100 to obtain my Azure cybersecurity architect expert cert, and hopefully have that done here in the next month or two. 
 I wanted to thank everybody that came in and showed me some support and camaraderie when I was down in the dumps and not seeing a way out. I took some of your advice and I'm running with it, and happy to report that I am interested and excited again in the things I am now doing.
 From an old salty dog in this industry, a big thanks to my fellow IT warriors out here.

 What tool do you use to schedule maintenances and find (indirectly) affected services?
 Customers directly connected to a network element or a specific region are easy to filter, but we also have a lot of P2P connections, these can also be indirectly affected when intermediate elements are undergoing maintenance.
 These fall into two categories:
 a) indirectly affected, but re-routing possible
 b) indirectly affected, but no alternative paths available
 Thanks for your suggestions!

 If you are charging multiple tablets in an enclosed area, make sure they are not stacked on each other and have proper airflow around them. A school a mile from house had a fire over the weekend due to iPads charging while being stacked on each in an area with no real airflow.

 Just looking for some advise/anecdotes on what others have done. We are getting ready to open a new office and I've got some gear that the office will need. List includes:
  
Meraki Switches
 Meraki Firewalls
 UPS system
 Rack Mount PDUs
  
My preference is for a 4 post rack system but this office only comes with a Chatsworth 22Y9, which is a 2 post system. I haven't typically had to buy this equipment in the past as datacenters I've hosted gear in already come with 4 post rack systems and such. Is it possible/recommended to simply get a 2nd 2post rack and do a make shift 4 post system? Or should I just make a play and ask management to scrap the existing 22Y9 and spring for a 4 post rack?

 As an optimization for pure Data-Plane flood-and-learn process (multicast), BGP was extended so VTEPs could learn MAC addresses from BGP advertisements. This reduces the amount of multicast traffic caused by unknown unicast: once an end-host boots up and sends any packet, like ARP for the default gateway, that host’s MAC is learned and advertised into BGP so every VTEP will learn it and populate their forwarding table.
 Once a packet hits the VLAN access interface of a VNI, it'll check what VRF its apart of, if it'll use either the L2 or L3 VNI as the VXLAN ID depending on if the remote device is on the same VNI or another. The VTEP will either know to send the packet across to the other VT…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So PoE extension might not even be the best option here for me, and if it isn't you all have a better idea please feel free to recommend it. As it stands: I have a client that has a 1 Gigabit wireless bridge between two buildings. I have to move one of the Bridges in order to get it to line-of-site. Going up is not an option. I know you can buy Active PoE Extenders and daisy chain them together to get up to 1000 feet of ethernet (which is more than enough for what I need). 
 I am looking to extend the ethernet around 850 feet. What I'm confused on is Active vs. Passive. I was going to use an Active PoE Switch to power the ethernet extenders (I would need two). My issue is: the Bridge is Passive PoE (24v). I know Active 802.3-latest is "smart" and won't push power to the Bridge, but I am wondering what to do from here. Do I get a Passive PoE Splitter? Do I need to get one that is specifically 24v? 
 I am familiar enough with the 802.3af, 802.3at etc but I really need help understanding what to do at this point. And like I said, would I be better served to do something like an Ethernet to Fiber setup? I know I can get over 1000 feet from a setup like that.
 I'm just wondering what you all have in mind. I would really appreciate the help.

We have checked firewall settings, DNS settings, checked the switch, no network drops, very confused by this. This morning we had a new user report they could not connect to the internet. Meanwhile the other computers in the office are connected with no issues. The disconnects are so random and it will only happen on a few computers at a time in different areas of the office.

 I'm confused at how it is handed over to the CP. My understanding is that it is a 'wires only' layer 2 service. Would I be correct in saying that means there are no IP addresses involved?
 What does a CP need to do on their side to accommodate BT Ethernet Services? Do you just need a switch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have the task of trying to get our WSUS server working correctly as it's been left in an unusable state.
 I would not consider myself experienced with WSUS or scripting however I'm always willing to learn and try my best!
 WSUS is currently running on Windows Sever 2012 R2 VM.
 WSUS Version: 6.3.9600 18694
 The two big issues I'm facing is it is extremely slow and it constantly crashes with failed snap in errors. with the majority of devices not being up to date.
 The cause in my eyes looks to be the fact the driver specification was ticked, meaning we have 674987 updates unapproved.
 I would like to decline all driver updates and purge them from WSUS and just have security updates and feature updates.
 I have unticked the driver classification and ran the WSUS Server clean-up wizard. However it does not seem to remove the current set of unapproved updates. I have also tried to run some script's found online but alas this has not worked either.
 Would really appreciate some help as I'm really struggling to make progress on this one.
 Thanks
 Sam

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been looking through our cloud storage providers, and seem to have 4 different ones we pay for. My girlfriend as a office 365 personal subscription, with 1TB. She uses many apps that are with it
 My idea is to move all our photos, documents video, and music to the 1 TB on 365. Then cancel all other subscriptions.
 A few questions, there seems to be a few different options for 365, if all the files go onto the personal account/cloud, can I from my one drive ,view everything if it is set to share with my MS account?
 Wondering whether to get the 365 family, apart from the 1TB per user, is there any advantage?
 All the apps/software which is available,is not really something I need.
 I also came across 365 Pro Plus, which I cannot figure out what it is exactly. It seems to be a one time payment, with the same as 365 personal or family is a renewable licence.
 Can anyone explain the difference?
 I hope this make sense what I ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about what plans people have in place (if any) for when the brown stuff happens.
 We have 2 core switches, in different physically separate buildings, each access switch links back to both.
 We have 2 firewalls, one in each building, 2 and ISP connections feeding both firewalls. Each of the buildings also has its own wan switches and wan routers.
 We back up EVERYTHING at our Primary DC which is located in our head office and to a DR site in a collocated data center about 3 miles away, we back up at least once a day (some systems backup hourly) using Veeam.
 We have a contingency plan for servers and systems if something kills primary sites. Realistically unless there's a power failure or some kind of apocalyptic event. Think worst-case, think the building Data Centre has been fired and both redundant cores are down.
 For the sake of discussion, let's assume you still have your off-site backups and application in the DR site, and both redundant core switch fails at the primary site. In that case, Servers and workstations lose connectivity to the network.
 How would you route end users to connect to the DR site?
 Has anyone actually dealt with such a scenario; how did it go? If not, what plan do you have or what is the suggestion?

I get to learn new stuff every day and absolutely adore that. Now to my question. How do you deal with office politics? I interface often with our c suite due to our helpdesk being very inexperienced so I end up spending about 15 hours a week fixing printers and explaining how to use word to people who make 3x what I do. I don't mind that part so much but it's a vipers nest up there and they keep dragging me into it. My boss does what he can and tells me to point them to him but then the same people are just even more pissed at me. I'm now getting more and more angry about the situations I'm pulled in to, mostly the accusations that IT doesn't do anything while I'm working 50-60 hour weeks to keep thing halfway working while I upgrade as much as I can. Any advice the greybeards can give?

 I've got either the same or similar issue on two sites, both running unifi kit, one is effecting sage 50, the other RDP connections!

I have realized by using https://config.office.com/ to manage build versions that some computers do not belong to us. 
 I guess the way is linked to our firm is by the tenant association key and by generating a new one and associating the right key to the software would be a solution. This seems to be a bit far fetched and I would like to simplify it. 
 On the section https://myaccount.microsoft.com/device-list it gives you the option to disable device. What does this exactly do? It cannot possibly disable the computer itself right?
 On the section https://portal.office.com/account#installs allows you to sign out from the device but of course the installation will remain there with the organizations tenant association key. 
 The goal being to remove the association of the software and our platform since it is not managed by us anymore, what are your thoughts?

 my predecessor barely documented anything, so the CEO wants me (only IT guy) to work 4d/week on documentation. One day is reserved for user problems.
 Anyways, when I was in school 6 months ago, we didn't really learn about documentation & my last place was a shitshow so there was never anything being documented.
 I'm trying my hardest in at least documenting anything (screenshots, colour coded words, full sentences with reason on why I did this etc.) but my boss really wants me to work like a project manager. 
 He showed me how they work on their annual statements (we are public) but how am I supposed to work exactly like that, when he has 5 people who went to University and have degrees in those things?
 Are there any tips or software I can use to help my process in being more efficient?
 I'm using yEd to construct a logical plan on how everything is connected etc, but it all takes so much time..
 Thanks for any help!!

ADHD has some insanely bad consequences if left untreated. Serious systemic 'life outcome' vulnerabilities. Your odds of addiction, prison, car accidents, teen parenthood*, depression, burnout and suicide are all a LOT higher.
 
It's highly heritable, and a lot of people with ADHD have one or both parents with ADHD.

Sometimes I have even came across situations when, on my working hours, I need to solve issues and add functionality to free and open source software solutions.
 The thing is that, the company I work for is not a software company, we don't even have corporate GitHub or Gitlab accounts. So usually I just take note of what I did for a specific project and once I'm home, on my free time, I try to replicate it under my personal account.

I already see managers try to get close to me positioning themselves to ask for some kind of rescue, which like I said I think there are very capable people out there but the management of the company I’m leaving is broken. Many ppl have left and many have been bought out to stay (in different depts) with big money. So it’s these ppl who are earning big money and trapped into this company that I feel will try to do anything in their power to reach me or have me “rescue” this place IT wise when I’m gone. One already “threatened” - “I’m still going to be calling you” this is one that kept calling nights weekends etc and giving insane amounts of work and bullying my boss to bully me to have things done at the snap of her finger. I know I will block and ignore but at the same time I don’t want to have these distractions when I’m going to be trying to start at a new job, thus thinking about changing my phone.
 What was your reasoning for the ones that did it?

 I was basically "guaranteed" a promotion 2 years in a row, but it didn't go through... again. It fell through the 2nd annual-review in a row. Now it "should be sometimes in the next few months... just waiting on paperwork to go through."
 last year, work load increased, then when the promotion failed, workload seemed to decrease. This year, was promised it again, my review was written well, even got a bonus. The raise though, is less than what inflation did to my paycheck (technically, I am making less regarding inflation).
 How much actual work within a company does it take to get promoted - from the upper-management side of things with paperwork and the final decision? I've usually trusted my manager pretty solid, and our communications has been pretty spot on for the many years I've worked with him, but starting to question things... . On the flip side, upper management seems to be constantly in a political battle with themselves over the past 2+ years. trying to get some feedback. Thanks.

In a pinch I've found it to be small, portable (goes in a pocket or wallet), very convenient when troubleshooting cross connects at a datacenter without constantly needing a light meter. The cost is steep at first for the F-IRC2-F (https://www.newport.com/p/F-IRC2-F) card I use, but is actually cheap when compared to their other cards (https://www.newport.com/f/near-infrared-nir-sensor-cards). It also works on CWDM + DWDM frequencies too.
 I hope this doesn't come off as a promoting a product persay, but wanted to show off a fantastic tool I've used for years, to my fellow colleagues.

 You know when you’re watching a movie and some hacker or hacker gang appears and they have some sort of « hacker lab » in an abandoned warehouse somewhere with a bunch of drops and equipment. 
 It always made me wonder as a sysadmin, how do you explain anonymity in such scenarios?
 Like I know it’s fiction and it’s all for show, but as a Sysadmin it kinda bothers me that I cannot explain to myself how such setup could be achieved without being tracked. 
 Like what, do they go up to an ISP and be like “Yo can I get a public IP for my edge router in that creepy abandoned warehouse so I can perform illegal online activities that law enforcement can track back to us through you?”
 Or do they hijack someone else’s line from the DMARC box of the ISP? 
 What are your theories on how such anonymous “hacker labs” can be achieved?

 Our current system of deployment is a golden image through a local imaging system. I believe now is the time to get into bed Intune, Auto Pilot and all that goodness.
 Does anyone have any good whitepapers or sites discussing this in some clear concise ways? Any hints or pit falls that I must avoid?
 I am thinking to start I will document our current GPs etc and ensure we replicate the used and useful ones in to Azure Ad and then look to having all our WIN11 managed through there, then move the Win10 stuff into it. All with LOTS of testing first.
 Any big hints?
 Thanks

 How do the devices do active-active? Is there a floating active IP address or what?
 Do you need to manipulate traffic (with BGP) to send it to the primary device or how does it work?

 I’ve been struggling to find a solid solution for reliable connectivity. We have on prem ERP and CAD software as well as file shares. 
 We are currently testing a China Telcom SD WAN solution. It gave us a modest increase in bandwidth (6M). I expected the latency to increase due to last mile hops. Latency went from 280ms to 300ms. The problem is that we still have more than acceptable packet loss. There are periods of 10-20% loss. China Telcom’s support has been unable to assist us with troubleshooting this packet loss. I’m close to pulling the POC and going back to the IP-SEC tunnel between our firewalls. 
 My goal is to provide stable connectivity. Any thoughts or suggestions would be very much appreciated. Thanks!

So I am planning to host this on the web, so that in the future multiple admins can manage it.

 I am a noob at hosting things but I am happy to learn and try. Just wanted to know how I should go about this ?

 Long story short, I recently resigned from my IT director role. I'm fortunate to have some FU money saved up and I'm taking some time off before I take on my next role. In the meantime, I've been invited by a colleague to provide some guidance on the building out of tech services at a new facility in Zimbabwe. For me, it's a great opportunity to help an area of the world that may be lacking in IT expertise and I also love to travel.
 While I've been in IT for 25 years and have built many a network, server farm, office build out, etc. from scratch, I have no idea what specific challenges there might be around things like internet service, acquiring hardware and support, malware protection, and email.
 If there is anyone that might be up for a quick conversation, I would really appreciate it.

My question is, what is the next step I should take after the network administration? I would love to learn cloud, but I have no experience in programming, and I have seen job postings that were pretty demanding. Do you have any other advices? What should I learn further? Python? AWS?I know 1 year in network administration is not much, but I am still learning and trying to become better at it.

 I am based physically in China and manage orders for customers in Europe (as for now, always open to new business...) My main scope of business now is company gifts, meaning I have a lot of rather small orders, but many each week. My company is only few months old and I cannot afford a payable or customized ERP unfortunately, so I'm looking for a self-deployable ERP that could meet most of my requirements.
 Usually, I receive an inquiry from my client, "can you get 300 of these with custom logo ?". Then I make some sourcing if I don't already…]]></summary>

 Can someone please recommend a solution?
 What we need is something that integrates into 365 seemlessly and all emails with all data (attachments) need to be searchable and easily accessible (preferably from within outlook.
 Ywars ago, another company i used to work at used Enterprise Vault. As my memory recalls, it was so seemless. All current and archived emails all show within outlook. You could double click on an archived email and as that email is opening, enterprise vault used to retrieve the data from the backend and present it as if its just another current email.
 I dont know of any other solutions or if Enterprise Vault is still worth it.
 All suggestions welcome.

Our anti-spam policy is, as of now, set to the weakest setting and unfortunately, we are not seeing any improvement by training the AI. There is no really help from Microsoft. The escalations we already made do not bring any solution. The want to sell us a high price support contract although we've evidence the spam detection respectively the AI is bad (much too agressive). We're in contact with another organisation they've been fighting with this behaviour since about 5 years. 
 Fun fact also serious mails from MS or other organisation/companys using EOP, MDO and Exchange Online are classified as spam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I have N different servers each serving it's own webapp. I want to put these servers behind a reverse proxy, but now I created a single point of failure: if my reverse proxy is going to fail I wont be able to access any of these webapps.
 ​
 Is it possible to scale my reverse proxies up to 2-3 machines? My guess would be to setup local DNS and keep DNS server monitoring for main rpxory status, then switch 'A' record to another rpoxy if it fails, but I don't know how to implement this switchover (if it's even possible) and now it seems that this local DNS is going to be SPOF, so...
 ​
 Q: Why do you want to use rproxy and/or local DNS?
 A: To ease maintenance of the system. I can quickly change which domain (or ip) points to which machine and it's port (in case of rproxy).
 ​
 (If exact products relevant to this problem, I would use nginx as rproxy and bind9 as local DNS)

 I am a career shifter, very early in the career but I've been the one who has been carrying these guys who are paid more.
 These are people that failed me when I was graded on teamwork, because I don't join for drinks (I honestly don't care for them after the job, I am paid to do work and not more). No amount of complaining to my manager made a difference.
  
My action:
 As of now, whenever a shift has anything unhandled, and it was a deliberate act of ignoring the issue, i log it as "unprocessed by Nightshift. No Handover, no notes provided."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have seen far too many "spot the phish" presentation that dissect a poor quality scam email, and point out the mistakes in it. 
 This is sending entirely the wrong message, because your users are now thinking that's how you detect scams. 
 When all that does is weed out the poor quality ones, and you make them more susceptible to the well crafted ones, because they think they know better. 
 But scammers aren't all careless. Most of the carelessness is deliberately filtering for victims already. 
 I have seen some very high quality spear-phishing attempts recently, that don't have "mistakes" in them. They have email addresses that look very plausible - sometimes spoofed, sometimes belonging to the .co.uk for a .com or similar.
 Occasionally coming from a personal email that looks like it could be a legitimate member of staff. Etc. 
 But elegantly crafted, personalised and a very plausible sort of request or warning. 
 The only way to spot these is to be skeptical about all of them. Don't rely on lazy scammers to be obvious about it, because that makes you vulnerable to the ones that aren't.
 If you want an analogy, then lets go with foraging for mushrooms. There's a load of varieties of mushrooms that are edible and very tasty. Some look a bit weird. https://www.wildfooduk.com/mushroom-guide/?mushroom_type=edible
 But if I describe to you Fly Agaric and you avoid that, it still doesn't make the Destroying Angel safe to eat!
 (Seriously - don't go foraging mushrooms unless you are VERY sure you recognise exactly which varieties are 'safe', and never ever eat one you're even slightly unsure about).

 I wanted to start a discussion on network architecture. Specifically, I'm curious about your experiences with stacking in the Core layer. Do the networks you work on allow for this? What are the pros and cons you've encountered? 
 On one hand, there's the benefit of having a single management and reduced dependency on STP, bundling of links (ether channels), eliminating need for HSRP but on the other hand there are also the potential downsides such as a single point of failure and upgrades difficulty in software upgrade’s especially in critical operations environments where downtime is extremely difficult.
 Let's hear your thoughts and experiences!

 About a month into employment my boss found out I'm into homelabs and have the ability to take over their IT responsibilities from their MSP. Not my call.

 Somethings not adding up.

 What should I add to the bottom where my monthly fees should be and my responsibilities are? 
 I've never done a job like this and I think they're banking on me feeling I'll-confident so I don't ask for more pay but coursing me into doing the entire work of their MSP and handling the migration for what I think is not a 22/hr job

Is it also disabled between devices on LAN i.e. two employee computers in office, or between computers in a university lab etc? 
 Seems like on corporate it usually isn't blocked, but not sure about schools/universities, seems like they go out of way to block a lot of stuff ie games, some voip apps etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, we have a very remote site with two DCs and a handful of workstations. Everything has been powered off and is now reaching the 180 day mark, so we expect it to be tombstoned when the equipment is all started back up.
 For logistical reasons there may not be a way to get personnel on site before the equipment needs to be powered back up, and it may be a PITA to resolve the AD issues remotely as the only means of access is via relatively slow satellite internet. It's doable but not fun at all. 
 Is it possible to "trick" the domain into avoiding the tombstone at powerup? Say for example, going into each machine at initial powerup before the OS is loaded and setting the BIOS clock back close to the last time the domain was live, and then moving the clock forward after all the machines have synced up? The machines will not have an external NTP time source initially so we don't expect that they will magically fix their clocks until we do it manually.
 Thanks!

 I’m currently a T2 support for about 6 years now. Our Sr sysadmin guy unexpectedly quit and now our our sysadmin guy moved up. As a T2 support, I handle SCCM stuff, MDM and escalation from our Tier 1s and very well in my comfort zone. 
 The new gig comes with a 8K paybump but probably stressful as heck especially during adjustment period for me. I took a peek at the sysadmin guy’s queue and I got terrified. Lots of unknowns and things that I wouldn’t have any clue how to do. Is this normal? I haven’t accepted the job yet as I told both my boss and his boss that I’ll be thinking about it over the weekend. 
 It took a lot from me to get to this expertise level to a point that I don’t even get stressed anymore since I’m very comfortable at doing this job. How did you guys made the jump? 
 When I first became a T2, I was stressed AF and lost some sleep. Me, being a young Dad l, with 2 young boys makes me want to turn down this opportunity. My spouse thinks I will absolutely kill this job once I get the hang of it.

 I have accumulated around 100 old disks and that might go up to no more than 1000 in the next few years. The CYA disposal way is to destroy them ourselves.
 Anyone have a specific recommendation for some simple safe and cheap destroying device? 
 We have stuff like a drill press available but that seems more laborious than it could be.

 A few jobs I was interested in required ccnp, but on the programming portion at the time I was clueless. 
 I've gone through all the materials for ccnp, but I have many certifications already. I really feel like certifications are a never ending rabbit hole. People want palo and cisco certs, but I've also been told nobody cares.
 Regarding python in a week's time I'm already automating backups, checking network states, and delving into programming massive amounts of switches at once. 
 I have ccna security, SonicWALL, Aruba professional etc. 
 Many are still interested there's just some jobs that require these certifications. It's impossible to collect them all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A community centre I help out with wants to upgrade its wifi provision from a couple of cheap unmanaged 802.11n APs to something a bit better with centralised control and management. We're looking at about 5 APs and using a cheap L2 POE switch to power and sort VLANs etc.
 Traditionally I'd suggest an Ubiquiti Unifi setup, as while the hardware costs are a bit higher you didn't need to worry about licencing going forward. However their licencing model seems to have changed, and while buying the APs with a 3-year licence isn't too expensive, it does raise questions as to what the costs will be for renewals.
 Can anyone suggest another managed wifi system I could look at and recommend? Budget is an issue otherwise Ruckus and Meraki would be on the table, but I want to avoid the really cheap and nasty solutions as the cost savings would be wiped out in maintenance/service calls

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year I started a new position with a relativity small IT team supporting a very complex and geographically diverse set of IT assets. It's been really frustrating since so many tools and processes which are common in most other IT organizations seems to be missing entirely from this one. 
 ​
  
No ticketing system
 No project management system
 No change management system
 No systems documentation or runbooks
 No systems monitoring tools
 No out of band management
 No system imaging solution
 No asset management solution
 No software deployment solution
 Inadequate data protection for core assets
 File shares residing on fast SSD storage but without snapshots
 VM's hosting databases running on slow HD storage
 Multiple instances of vSphere, each with their own VCSA, but with no HA clusters defined
 ESXi hosts all maxed out with no remaining capacity to vmotion anything off
 Electrically overloaded datacenters, PDU's, UPS's, etc.
 Most server hardware well past EOL
  
The list goes on an on. Each day I am discovering some new problem.
 While the IT manager admits some of this is problematic, we're in the process of building out yet more complexity without pausing to fix any of these underlying structural deficits. This leaves me wondering whether I should just toss in the towel and go look for another job.

 These are the people I don't feel guilty for calling after hours or when they're on PTO to ask basic questions because of the lack of documentation when something breaks.
 Are they even teaching documentation in schools? I don't remember ever being told to document or even how to document. 
 Even certs like A+, Net+, CCNA, or the few mcse courses I'm familiar with. None of them talk about the importance of documentation. The closest might be LAN/WAN diagrams or taking backups.
 My company even provides access to an online learning system and there are no specific courses on documentation or technical writing.
 Any time I work on or deploy a new system or software, there's usually a combination of three types of documentation I create; End User (if needed), information for the IT team to support/troubleshoot and personal notes (such as articles referenced during setup, steps to reproduce or other notes that wouldn't be beneficial to the team.)
 Even two or three sentences about something could save someone in the future time, headache and hassle.
 Most of the time, I don't create documentation for others - I create it for myself so I have something to reference in the future or can send to end users to minimize their need to reach out and bother me.
 Gah!

 By deafult most switch and firewall don't have ACL to block Inter VLAN traffic.
 Is there a security need for this? 
 For example I split Data, VoIP and IoT in separate VLANs.
 They can't broadcast across VLANs however devices still can be pinged.
 Should I created ACL's to stop inter VLAN traffic?
 Let's say a VoIP phone was compromised it can't broadcast across VLANs. Is there still risk it can find way to other VLANs?
 Respect VLAN main goal is to reduce traffic and broadcast times on a network.
 Do you also use to to secure the network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After all these years there has got to be a term or relevant XKCD about these kinds of folks. I'm sure many of us work with one, or have worked with one. 
 The person who intentionally sets things up in such a complicated way that only they know how to administer it, maybe to feel a sense of importance or job security? 
 We have an admin who refuses to use a windows computer and does everything via Mac, even though our environment is 99% windows. We have a small team of media relations people who use Mac for graphic design, video editing, and a few apps that are specific to Mac. This is around 3 people. 
 This same admin, when tasked with rebuilding a Windows 2012 file server, insists on using Linux/Samba because it "will probably play nicer with the Macs". This is 2023, I highly doubt a Mac can't connect to a Windows SMB share. At the same time, he also insists on running BIND DNS inside a FLAR container on Solaris, when he is the only one that knows Solaris - these boxes also haven't been patched in years and run insecure versions of BIND.
 What do you call these people? Does anyone else have similar stories?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm a new system administrator at a company that recently had a major server failure, and it was quite the experience. The server was hosting six production VMs, and due to a single PSU failure and motherboard issue(My finding), it completely failed. The worst part was that the previous system administrator had not backed up the critical databases.
 As the new guy, I was tasked with recovering the databases, and I was totally freaked out. I tried to recover the databases, but the server was unable to POST the ESXi, which made things even more challenging. After some trial and error, I decided to unmount the server from the rack and take it to my desk. I disassembled the server, removed the RAM, cleaned it with a vacuum, and rested it for over 10 hours.
 To my surprise, the hypervisor loaded successfully, and I was able to dump the six database files from one VM. However, the server suddenly went down, and I was unable to shift the dumped files. I tried again, and after a few attempts, the server worked for two hours before crashing again.
 At this point, I knew I had to act fast. I backed up everything and restored the system the next day, which was a challenging task, but I managed to get it done.
 I'm curious to hear about your experiences with server failures and database recovery. What are some of the worst cases you've encountered? And how did you handle them? Let's share our stories and learn from each other.

 Zero.
 I made a post of a while back on a different account about hating my manager. He manipulated and micromanaged me, spoke to me like crap, threw temper tantrums, screaming, the works. He'd give really excessive praise one minute and then absolutely rip you to shreds a few hours later. My mental health was seriously suffering. It wasn't uncommon for me to just get drunk alone after work to cope with his bullshit. I remain convinced he is narcissistic. 
 I followed the golden advice of this sub and got the fuck outta there (with a nice pay rise too!). Working my notice period didn't go quite to plan (they then started to target me specifically, even in front of HR) so I just said fuck it and never went back.
 I am SO much happier in my new job. Is there fuck tonnes to do? Yes. Does my manager want updates on every little thing and start screaming at me the second he misunderstands something? Nope. He is so chilled. I don't think this guy has ever stressed about anything in his life. 
 Apologies for the client click bait title. I guess all I wanted to share was that if you're unhappy, just leave. Despite the "impending recession", the IT market is still going strong. Thank you guys, I love this community.

 I will be undergoing a hardware refresh at some point this year, replacing my FortiGate 200D and pair of Cisco 3750s, which are both already EOL or soon to be. 
 Currently the core switches act as the gateway.
 With the refresh, I am entertaining the idea of segmenting traffic at the Fortigate, or it being the new gateway. 
 Can the firewall handle that type of traffic? How would that topology look? 
 We are a medium size org, 150 users, 200 devices. No intensive workloads

The customer is interested in a RDS load balancing option that will consider CPU/RAM utilization on the session hosts in determining which server to put a new connection on. The built-in load balancing that the RDS gateway does is basically only number of users, with no consideration around metrics. It looks like there are a few third party apps that do this. Does anyone have a recommendation around this, and most importantly - can it be added on top of an existing RDS deployment? We're not interested in rebuilding things if we can avoid it. Thank you!

 We're willing to do it, but seeing as they'd be going up onto what seems like an already very well established firmware train, it's going to be a lot of reading of release notes to try and understand if anything might break and what's actually changing between the major versions. 
 Any actual real life experience whist I read several years of documents would be appreciated, thank you!

 ​
 I'm helping out a local charity with some of their IT stuff, a part of this is to move the infrastructure to the cloud to enable better remote working.
 Whilst cloud infrastructure is my bread and butter - Local networking is not a strong suit and I'm struggling to find a suitable solution.
 My aim is to have the users VPN into the office (In a tunnel all mode kind of mode), and for the cloud resources to then be reachable that way.
 The charity does not have any real onsite networking gear besides an old Technicolor Router, so I'm wanting to put in place a low-cost hardware solution for a VPN that users can connect to from their laptops. I've done this previously with Sonicwalls, but fear that these might be out of budget. Is there a good low-cost alternative?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to find a solution to replace our numerous scheduled robocopy batch jobs on multiple computers.
 The most common configuration is weekly, daily or on demand copy of files from one or up to three directories to a SMB share. It's currently deployed on ~100 computers which are in an isolated network which has no access to the internet or any cloud services.
 Goals I'd like to accomplish are
  
some kind of monigoring to keep track if a planned copy job failed, didn't start or didn't finish i.e. client was turned off, client couldn't reach the network etc.
 (optionally) some kind of dashboard
 easy to deploy and configure for our first line
 possible to run with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account
  
Couple of products I reviewed either:
  
reliead on java (too many problems if a client relieas on a different version of java, also a resource hog),
 cloud (not acceptable security-wise),
 relied on a dedicated server as a worker (bottlenetck).
  
This is a last resort question before I start to design my own solution. Any input appreciated!

 I have device targeted apps in Intune across alot of SMB clients working no problem, so the enrollment process is working as a prerequisite to Autopilot, just fine.
 First Autopilot throws a 0x81036502 app error. Attempting to pull MDM Logs from Autopilot GUI on client throws an 0x800700 Access Denied error.
 Attempting to dump the logs on c:\ through cmd fails with same error, ok fine MS says cannot dump on root.
 Tries to dump on USB stick and then again all new 0x000000 error.
 .... Autopilot still total garbage.
 At this point its still more reliable to enroll with an install/demo user, hand to client and change primary user.

The device appears to be testing PoE, but for the block of 12 ports all at once, instead of just one. I’ve asked them for info but they have no idea (or willingness to check) who made it or the model etc.
 So, does anyone happen to know about these types of devices, or what this is called? Or something that achieves the same thing? I’ve searched and searched, but only find single port testers. My team has the need to test PoE on switches, often times several dozen, so a device that tests multiple ports like this would be really useful. Thank you!

 Typically, a rebuild for this array takes about 12 hours. Right now, it's estimating 12 days! The odd thing is, the entire system has slowed to a crawl. Any IO on C: or D: brings the system to a crawl. Programs lock up for a few minutes.
 Looking at the event logs, and I'm getting a bunch of the following events:
  
Event 9, Hyper-V-StorageVSP - An I/O request for device 'C:\Virtual Hard Disks\XXXX.vhdx' took 10675 milliseconds to complete. Operation code = READ16, Data transfer length = 4096, Status = SRB_STATUS_SUCCESS. We are getting this error for both C and D drives.
 
Event 129, percsas2i - Reset to device, \Device\RaidPort0, was issued.
 
 We also use VeeamOne and are getting disk latency alarms for both drives.
 I am able to export the VMs across the network to a different system without any issues.
 At this point, I'm thinking maybe a raid controller or backplane issue. Any thoughts? I'm super tried so pardon my if my post didn't make sense.
 Notes: Yes, I know the R720 is ancient. Everything on it is backed up and safe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 At a loss and need some help.
 We are a small/medium sized business. 70ish people. Have a Watchguard Router and Unifi AP's/Switches.
 Ran into an issue last week where our 16-XG died. Would keep shutting off randomly. Couldn't find one available immediately, so had to reroute the cables to a different switch on the rack while we found a replacement.
 Got a USW-Pro-Aggregation to replace it.
 Switched everything to the new one, thought we were all in the clear.
 Started getting emails around 11/11:15 at night that VPN/network was down. Reboot the Watchguard and everything is back up and running. Get the same messages in the morning around 6:30/7 pm. Watchguard reboot fixes it again.
 More of the same all week, thought I might've plugged a cable in wrong somewhere, and that was causing issues. Gone over all of them, and everything looks to be fine. Thought maybe our backups were causing the issue, since they run at around 11pm at night, kinda made sense.
 Turned off Backups last night, same thing happened.
 Turned them back on tonight, and same thing happened.
 In the Unifi Console, the amount of clients on certain switches doubles. The switches at times show a Down speed of 79641 Mbps, but average 300-1000Mbps. Clients also show a huge download. But on the PC's I can't see anything being downloaded. Looks like there's a ton of traffic from the backups using Wireshark. But my knowledge of Wireshark is very limited.
 The only way to get things going again is by rebooting the Watchguard, or one of the network switches.
 Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 I can't find a way to store a position number and then create the rules based on the range of position numbers. Example - Position 100 - 200 is accounting, 201 - 299 is Human Resources and so on. 
 2 questions - where can I store the position code on AD and how do I create a rule based on a range for integers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because of this thread, I brought it up with my therapist and was just diagnosed conditionally as inattentive ADHD at a late age. I have another appointment with a doctor that is going to go through some things with me to give me a "second opinion" on my conditional diagnosis.
 A month ago when the post was first put out there I read it in full, comments and all, and almost everything that people were putting out there seemed to jive with how I am. 
 I dive deep into MANY MANY things/hobbies I'm interested, I misplace things easily, I jump from topic to topic, or task to task at work, and many other things that jived with the post/comments.
 My therapist also explained that many folks who undergo many stressors during a young age, like I was brought up, don't usually get diagnosed with ADHD. Their brains bar for stress is much higher and it's usually chalked up to that. 
 I want to thank /u/sobrique for bringing this topic up and leading me down an enlightening path. 
 I have recently seen on reddit posts after the above post that ADHD is very heavily linked to alcoholism and I with alcoholism. I don't drink during the day( or even think about drinking alcohol), and only at night a little too much and things have become unmanageable with relationships in my life. I have been seeking help with alcoholism for quite some time, I had a long hiatus from alcohol and fell back in recently after some stressful situations. I am hoping that this diagnosis, with a coupled medication(dopamine levels normalizing, and not partaking), can help me get off of alcohol and get the old me back. 
 I have blathered on too long and need to go to bed now. I thank you all for being you and reading my post. Their is hope in this world and I love you all. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, i have a consideration of building a network for data center.. It'll only be for IoT devices that's related to the dc operational needs, like cctv, electrical or temp sensor, etc. There will be 5 floors, and approximately around 17 thousands of ip or endpoints will be used.
 So i'm considering using vxlan for the sake of IP efficiency and broadcast storm prevention, since there'll be 5 floor and the switches will be put everywhere.
 Is there a best way to do the segmentation? Considering using a /17 subnet in one vlan, i'm a bit afraid of the domain failure. If I use dedicated / different vlan for each floor (by floor vlan segmentation), i can't see the benefit of the vxlan is utilized. (And also, i think there'll be unused ip since the allocated subnet can't be used in different floor) If I use dedicated / different vlan for each specific IoT category, i'm considering about the dailyops, since there'll be no thing such as ISE or ClearPass in place..
 Any advise / suggestion will be much appreciated, thank you in advance

 I currently have HPE switches. I know you get SFP module I am just unsure about the exact specs needed. 
 Also should the terminations be SC or LC?

 Are there any decent corporate browsers anymore that aren't Chrome or Edge? I'm actually considering looking at Firefox.
 Edge was actually a decent alternative to Chrome for a bit but they continue to add so much ridiculous bloat to it that it's a joke now and I'm convinced whoever is in charge of that team is on drugs. The list of things I have to disable on Edge via GPO was already huge.

 All we do is cloud based nothing on prem (fyi).
 That said, I want to search for an easy to use ticketing system that we can learn to configure and have our users to use it to submit tickets instead of hitting us up on teams or calls. My goal is to streamline support so this casual walk-up stops and folks submit a ticket.
 Also this ticketing system needs to be hosted by them, as we so not have servers on prem. 
 I have used service desk by manage engine, service now but never as an admin of them.

 I have 11 sites, interconnected with Prisma ION-1000 SD-WAN devices. Most of the sites have 2 ISP connections. We have been using DHCP on most of the Verizon boxes we use, but have run into issues of connectivity between several of the sites. This week, they replaced the ION device at one of our locations, and we additionally asked Verizon for a static IP for the location. They assigned the IP to the wireless box and provided us with the info. As I was digging into the settings and info today, I realized that the IP they had assigned to us is the IP of the Default Gateway of one of our other devices. I remember seeing this previously, when configuring 4 other Verizon devices for distribution to locations, and thought it odd. The new device has connectivity issues, and I am unsure how to fix the problem, or if this is even possible, in this configuration? Am I missing something, or can I configure something specifically to alleviate the problem? Thank you, in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody
 ​
 I have a strange behavior on my company network and after many hours, I can't understand or find any logic.VLAN's are configured on Fortigate 80F firewall (VLAN ID24 for guest network, on 10.4.24.0/24 with 10.4.24.200 GW) and I've tagged the VLAN ID 24 on my Netgear S3300 switch.
 When I connect through wired cable a Windows 10 laptop, everything is fine. My client received an IP from DHCP delivered by the firewall, I get my IP, gateway, mask, DNS... and I can get outside through my gateway normally
 But when I connect a laptop with a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Centos or a device with a Linux kernel), I get an IP from DHCP but I can't go outside and I can't ping my gateway.
 I've tried with 3 linux (live usb boot) differents, same behavior.
 I've verified the routes and eveything seems to set correctly
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 0.0.0.0; 10.4.24.200; 0.0.0.0; UG 20100 0 0 enp2s0
 10.4.24.0; 0.0.0.0; 255.255.255.0 U 100 0 0 enp2s0
 ​
 If some kind soul could help me to understand what is going on :)

 Rack Allotment: https://i.ibb.co/VBQRw3X/Screenshot-39.png
 Racks are connected with 10Gb/s OM4 fiber optics cables.Asking ourselves how many routers we should plan.We thought about just one firewall router, configured in high availability mode (if one fails, the second one kicks in). So, just one router at time which will be providing both LAN routing and LAN to WAN routing.
 Assuming a VAR who specialises in networks planning, is working on this, do you see any weak points in this scheme? Any comment is highly appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 Recently got into this weird issue.
 My Macbook M2 cannot seem to connect to certain private IPs using certain protocols (as stated in the title). Let's say the private IPs are all in the range of 192.168.0.0/16, my Macbook is in 10.0.1.0/24
 - I can connect to some hosts in 192.168.12.0/24, by their open ports/listening services (say HTTPS)
 - I cannot connect to other hosts in 192.168.13.0/24, by their open ports/listening services. Even telnet to ports do not return anything (which seemed like an indicator of a firewall in between)
 - However, there are no firewalls or access lists in between my Macbook and the destinations - I confirm this since this is the network that I manage and own, and there have been no anomalies detected. No routing configuration changed.
 - I can ping/traceroute using ICMP to the hosts
 - Another colleague's Macbook, in the same source as 10.0.1.0/24 can connect to mentioned host without problems
 - I have done tcpdump with the following commands, which return no packets if the traffic belongs to one of the affected flow (say the host I'm trying to connect to is 192.168.13.13)
 sudo tcpdump -nnvv host 192.168.13.13 0 packets captured 0 packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel 
 - For a certain Window DNS server in 192.168.13.0/24, I can use it to resolve the DNS queries (via dig). I cannot, however, connect to it via RDP (while I was able to just one week ago). Tcpdump displayed DNS requests/responses, ICMP requests/replies, but no RDP traffic even coming out of the Macbook
 ​
 This has recently happened. I'm currently on Ventura 13.2.1
 ​
 Please assist me in this case. This subreddit does not allow crossposting from r/macbook, so this would be a duplicate thread :)
 ​
 P.s: I have also restarted my Macbook a few times. Not gonna work with such trick

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thought I would post this in case others haven’t thought to leverage Connectwise to install the Office update for CVE-2023-23397. We have 700 on premise domain joined Windows 10 machines in offices and remote/home locations. Moving to Intune soon but not there yet.
 Here's what we have done making it a breeze:
  
Notified staff that any MS Office applications left open on the screen would shut down @ 11:00 when we sent the command.
 WOL all office based devices
 Highlighted all machines in Connectwise and sent the command below
  
"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\OfficeC2RClient.exe" /update user displaylevel=false forceappshutdown=true 
  
Any machines online updated there and then including machines not logged into.
 For the 300 or so machines not turned on, as and when they have been coming online, they have checked in with Connectwise and the original queued command has then run updating office.
  
Along with using https://config.office.com/ to track progress, In Connectwise we have also used a custom property to store the office version/build and then scope a session group to this to keep track of unpatched versions.
 Command for Custom Property: 
 Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty VersionToReport 
 Session Group – Subgroup expression (remember to update refresh custom properties):
 IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*16130.20306', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*16026.20238', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*15928.20298', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*15601.20578', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*14931.20944', 'PATCHED', 'NOT PATCHED')))))

 I was reviewing Microsoft Defenders 'Experts on Demand' costings, and have seen this has now been rebranded to Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting.
 After talking to the Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting team, it seems we're not eligible for a few reasons.
 So my question, does anyone have any alternatives to the 'Microsoft Defender Experts on Demand' option, to support our Microsoft Defender environment in for any scenarios where incidents are too advanced for our inhouse IT.
 I am not looking for an alternative to 'Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting', just the 'Microsoft Defender Experts on Demand' option.
 Kind Regards,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I'm the developer and owner of a web application that's grown in popularity (and so visibility) over the past few years. In the last month or so, this has brought something new our way with a series of what I'm quite certain are DDoS attacks. Nothing that would crash Facebook, but HTTP requests for our landing and login pages at a rate of ~1000/second without follow-up for the page's resources. Attacks are happening maybe a few times a week.
 I've been building an IP blacklist from the points of origin, am rate-limiting these pages by IP, and have split login onto its own server, so that when these pages get flooded most of our users are not impacted. All of that has done a lot to mitigate the effects of these attacks.
 What's the long-term game, though? Should I be concerned that we're seeing regular attacks, or is this just a product of seeing more traffic? Are there other measures I should be taking? Can I be a better citizen of the internet by reporting points of origin to somewhere?
 Thank you so much for your thoughts on this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been an admin for a few years now, but despite my efforts it seems like the back side of our server racks always end up a mess. When I have the time, I will go through and try and clean up cables and get everything looking nice and neat, but I find it very frustrating since it seems like I keep making shortsighted decisions that I have to fix later on. 
 I used to have a similar problem to this back when I did more development work. I would struggle with naming classes and variables, but I eventually learned that using standards and good principles helped me get past those issues. Is there some sort of equivalent for server racks? It feels like an odd question but, I'm running out of ideas here... I'm also getting tired of having to unplug a bunch of stuff before I can slide a server out for maintenance.
 To provide some context I'm mostly dealing with Poweredge servers, with a few other oneoff devices mixed in.

 An TLS 1.2 connection request was received from a remote client application, but none of the cipher suites supported by the client application are supported by the server. The TLS connection request has failed.

 InsightIDR looks good, but is quite expensive for my (small) network of about 300 endpoints.
 ​
 What do you think? Are you using InsightIDR? Are you happy with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have PingID for SSO and MFA and have our M365/Azure authenticate through it. Here recently we've had some key users get locked out of AD constantly. This is because the authentication requests go to our DC to authenticate each SSO authentication, and because it's a brute force attempt, it's constantly locking out those users. 
 I reached out on multiple occasions to PingID and they dismissed it as "non issue" or pointed the finger back at us. I finally got some escalation and was taken semi-seriously at pointing out this issue (exploit??) and here was there recommendation: "Turn off AD lockout" What? So remove a security measure to open up an even bigger risk? Let them brute force the crap out of each user until they get the correct password, then move on to the next steps? Why would we give them that ability? We've asked Ping to provide logs of where the attacks are coming from, IP's, location, something. They refuse to give any. Their dashboard doesn't provide logs because they never (yet) have made it past the first authentication factor. It only logs on second factor.
 Ping recommends buying another product (Ping Federate) to solve this issue, but has not provided any details on how that fixes the issue. We also don't feel we should have to purchase more products from them to fix "their" issue.
 Here's where I'm stuck. Azure shows no logs. Purchased Azure AD P2 hoping that would help. No change in Azure AD logs. Nothing showing where the authentication attempts are coming from. Tried various geolocation and IP reputation blocks on Ping, nothing because it doesn't block until second factor. What else could be do to stop the AD Lockouts without "turning off AD Lockout" as Ping carelessly suggested? Anyone else experience this with PingID, or another provider?

 In lights of the recent Outlook exploit that is only affecting Win11 machines / windows server 2022, I'm trying to use Intune to display all the Windows 11 machines we have.
 Within Intune > Devices > Windows, on the "OS Version" filter, everything displays "10.0.1xxx" or "10.0.2xxx" I'd have assumed that it would show "11.0.0" or something similar for a Win 11 machine, unless I'm mistaken?
 It might be worth noting, our current Windows 11 machines were upgraded from Windows 10, not Windows 11 out of the box.
 Appreciate the help! :) And again, apologies if I'm potentially being silly at all here.

 I’ve been experimenting with application recognition and finding it a bit hit and miss. For example, google Remote Desktop seems cannot be recognised with 4.5.0 along with many others that are listed. In the old days anything with application awareness needed to be updated fairly regularly to stay up to date with application signatures. Is this a reason to run a pretty current software release? Not sure how good VMware SD-Wan is at application awareness but would have thought pretty good ?

 ​
 I wanted to get some long term real live usage feedback from you, since it's hard to find not sponsored and not auto generated reviews nowadays.
 ​
 I already use a password manager for my private day to day logins, so It's easier to remember the master pwd than all the ssh keys, and other tokens and logins. I have to switch often between systems, and to have to spin everything up is a pain, and keys/tokens in a set up script is an absolute no go. Being able to have access to all the keys from the console seems grate. 
 ​
 I use keeper as my private pwd manager and I'm happy with it, but 1password seems attractive too.
 What are your takes regarding these two?
 Maybe you all have another suggestion?
 Or another good solution? 
 My criteria:
 - simple commands and quick access to the basic functionalities (I don't need to manage it through the console, i just want to access)
 - my sysadmin at work should be happy
 - mobile app and browser extension (if on the go or having to access smthng through the browser)

 I'm trying to extend the visibility of teams calendars (before judgement is passed, we are a small business and everyone is fine sharing calendars, consents are signed and filed). So we have manager's team, where MD is the top manager and I can view all people directly reporting to him within the list of those calendars, but how do i include sub-managers team's into it as well? 
 Also, how do i enable employee reporting to sub-manager's to be able to view to full team as well? 
 I was hoping it was achievable through "manager's team calendar" as it's autodiscovery kind of feature without any setup for the users, rather than manually sharing or setting each mailbox to reviewer etc. 
 ​
 Any guidance appreciated, many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if similar cases have been asked before, but here's the situation:
 We have IOT devices out on the field, and these devices are hooked up to modems. These modems have generic 4G SIM cards in them. The IOT devices use this public 4G connectivity to push data to an FTP server unsecurely. CTO wants to change this. CTO wants to put the FTP server behind a private subnetwork, and he wants to have the 4G SIM modems connect to a VPN with a peering to the private subnetwork with the aforementioned FTP server.
 Here's the thing: I'm not sure how this works. The usage of 4G SIM cards means that the IP address is dynamic or keeps changing. Furthermore, the modem only supports some old L2TP/IPSEC protocol. As the CTO wants this to be on Azure, I've read about Azure Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site, but I don't know how to relate this back to these modems.
 Does anyone know how this is accomplished?
 The traffic goes from public 4G to VPN Client to Azure VPN Gateway subnet to private network with the FTP server.

 The issue we have is that the networks IP addresses are stored in some Excel files which are :
  
Difficult to update
 A PITA to use to add any more info than the name and IP of the device
  
I'm looking for a better solution, I tried netbox but it seems to be overkill and too much tailored to DC usage which we aren't. We do already have some of our equipements mapped using DNS names and reverse PTR in our DNS (which I also needs to migrate from a 15+ y/o server) which are monitored using zabbix. But Zabbix is only a monitoring tools, not a network mapping/inventoring one. My boss/coworker also tried at some point using Mediawiki, but the issue remains it's a PITA to maintain.
 So, fellow sysadmins, what do you recommend to replace those old Excel files ?

 I'd like to rename the Administrator account as, you know, Best Practices. I've found the MS article like below.

 What is the best way to do this and has anyone had any issues doing this?
 Has anyone done this? Run into any troubles?

 What I have collected so far:
  
Ubiquiti is a few steps below professional grade brands, as a whole
 Aruba series gets a lot of fans and seems to be a good overall solution
 Juniper Mist APs growing strong
 FortiXXX strong on firewalls, weaker on switching
  
This brings me to these ideas:
  
Use Fortigate for firewalling
 Use one-brand setup for switching, to keep things easier to manage
  
At this stage, I miss some thoughts about Juniper switches..... Is there any user who has an experience with these devices?

 I was contacted by a company recently for a job that looks quite neat.
 As I looked into the company I found out it is a (huge) debt collection agency. If they collected debts only from companies I'd probably be fine.
 But they also collect from the normal day to day person, say some poor sod just getting behind on bills due to unfortunate circumstances ending up collection horrible interest rates and something that was a couple hundred ends up in the thousands. I'd sort of be making money from making people miserable. Call me a bleeding heart or whatever, but that's the way it is.
 So I decided that just wouldn't fly with me.
 I've worked with things that may be considered unethical as well, legal intercept amongst others, but all I ever heard were people conspiring on fraud of various kinds. I was fine with that.
 So, boiled down, I wonder if anyone else ever said no to a job due to the product the company offers?

 I’ve been hired as a network engineer somehow and they want to build a new DC. My boss is requesting my input on having perimeter and internal (local network facing) firewalls. However as per my understanding, the main idea of that is for the DMZ, and we don’t have any need for it currently since all of our public services are in the cloud. Is having 4 firewalls worth it in that case? Are there any other use cases?
 ISP ——> Perimeter FW ——> DMZ ——> Internal FW ——> Network 
 Right now we purchased 2 Fortigate firewalls for the perimeter, and we’re thinking of adding 2 Palo Alto FW’s.

 I’m having to take an online class for a new PaaS thing we’re getting at work, and apart from the actual content kicking my butt, the so-called teaching method is driving me nuts… I need to have two browser windows open, one with the course material and videos and one with the lab environment, and an ebook open in its own app; the course material references the book, and the book directs the labs. 
 I haven’t taken any classes in probably 15 years because I learn best by doing not trying to ingest knowledge with no application, and I’m finding the whole experience to be less than optimal; jumping between three different environments breaks concentration, videos aren’t conducive to skipping back to review info, and I don’t feel I’m learning anything. I have two big monitors on my desk, which should be enough space for all this but it still feels inefficient. 
 My boss tells me I should take more classes when (if? Lol) I complete this one, but quite frankly, if this is the new normal for online learning it sucks.

 You don't need Intune for this either, I guess it works based on the UPNs logging into your tenant to the O365 Apps.
 You can then also go into 'Servicing' > 'Monthly Enterprise' > and roll out the latest version to a set amount of PCs (or all) and set a deadline of say 1 day to get updated. You probably would not want to do that every month, but there is flexibility.
 This may be old news, but I logged onto a dozen different clients and they did not have it turned on, so I guess not a lot of people know about it.

 We're mainly Macs (managed by Mac only MDM), but have a handful of Win devices that aren't managed atm. Normally I'd go straight to Intune, but since our org doesn't run on M365 (Apps for biz is the highest we go), Intune isn't the best option price wise. So looking for recommendations for other Win MDMs.
  
Hexnode looks interesting, and is cheaper than Intune.
 Scalefusion is a hard no due to their sales tactics.
 Managengine is a no due to some reviews in this sub...plus it's more expensive than Intune.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently implemented some ties between a small number of racks in a DC using FS 24 fibre MTP polarity solution. We used all SMOF components (standardising on SMOF in the DC) consisting of: 24F Type A Cassette <> 24F Type A trunk cable <> 24F Type AF Cassette. This works and allows standard A-B patch cables on either end when patching. Essentially Port 1 maps to Port 2 on the remote cassette (rolling the fibre). However, there was a bit of confusion during installation as each A cassette had to match with an AF.
  
I understand polarity with the 3 solutions for MTP-12 (Method A, B, C). Are these exactly the same for MTP-24? 
 Could we have achieved the same result using 2x 24F Type A cassettes, and a 24F Type C trunk cable in between? 
 What are others doing for inter-rack patching in the DC - sticking with straight-through 1-1 polarity (A/A/A solution) and using A-A patch cables on one end, or using the inter-rack MTP to roll the fibre (either with a A/A/AF or A/C/A solution)?
  
I'm also looking to break out some 400G and 100G ports to 4x100G and 4x10G respectively.
 My understanding is I would use a QDD-4X100G-LR-S or QSFP-4X10G-LR-S connecting to a 3 x 8F MTP cassette (each cassette could break out 3 ports from the switch) using a MTP-12 Type A trunk cable. Is this the best way of breaking out ports to 4x standard duplex LC connectors?

Got to the final round of a MSP and when I mentioned tech stacks they begrudgingly admitted their customers are heavy ibm legacy Java enterprise web applications users and the ticketing system is BMC remedy from 2009. 
 These systems have caused so much grief over the years I simply could not imagine working on them full time. The amount of security advisories alone can send your teams mental state to oblivion. 
 I felt bad turning them down but the hiring manager was very professional about it. Even mentioned hiring staff was becoming increasingly difficult as young or old hires are well aware these products reputation precedes them. The support teams are anemic and on a month to month biases vulnerabilities could pile higher than a dung beetle rolling shit. Anyone else have a vendor they simply won’t work anymore, with would love to hear why humorous or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working with this one client for a few years. They’re a break fix client, and I was trying to get them to approve some network improvements at one of their sites. It had an EoLed routers, switches, APs, the works. Additionally, the whole network was flat (a single subnet for their security system as well as their guest devices), and full of holes: ports 22, 80, 443, were open. They had some vulnerable VPN server running as well… it was a mess, and the whole thing needed to be overhauled, if not just dumped gasoline on. 
 Because there was a pile on of vendors who had performed work on this network over the years, there was also, of course, zero documentation. 
 When I went to segment the network, almost every device that had been installed had a static IP that was set inside of a password protected console. The job which should have taken a couple of days quickly turned into a nightmare. I had to track down ghost vendors. We had to call alarm companies. I had to get in touch with the people who installed a stupid TV remote, which only they had software to manage. After I called them, they asked why they “couldn’t access the TV remote’s management directly via the public IP address?”
 I learned to hate the static IP with a passion.
 So here’s my public service announcement: please set your damn static IPs via the router’s DHCP sever! That way they’re easier to manage if you need to move things around.

Some addresses get routed out of our backup while others use our main. The reason why this is an issue is that our backup ISP is having issues and is affecting our customers. On our switch before the router we have a static address pointing to a VRF. I do know we should maybe use VRRP between the routers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running a VxLAN EVPN fabric with Cisco NX-OS 9.3(11), which has a DCI to a legacy DC (DC1) I'm migrating away from. The DCI setup uses EVPN multisite for the border-gateways in the new DC (DC2) and vanilla vPC VTEPs in DC1. I'm transitioning from a classic setup in DC1 with VRRP on the SVIs, to distributed anycast-gateway in DC2. The plan was to stitch the vlans between DCs via the border-gateways, then per vlan when half the hosts are migrated shutdown the VRRP SVI and bring up the anycast-gateway SVI.
 I've realised that for vlans I've stitched across the DCI, I can't reach the anycast-gateway address from hosts in the legacy DC. The VTEPs in the new DC just don't advertise EVPN routes for those interfaces. I guess this makes sense conceptually, as the anycast-gateway is intended for hosts directly connected to the leaf. However I do need some hosts in the legacy DC to route via an SVI on the border-leafs in the new DC as part of the migration process.
 As a workaround I tried spinning up an SVI with VRRP on the border-leafs in DC2, which I thought would be a valid workaround which I could then transition to anycast-gateway once the vlan was emptied from DC1. But the SVI is suspended as soon as I remove fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway from the SVI config.
 Is this a known behaviour in VxLAN EVPN with anycast-gateway, that you can't combine a FHRP and anycast-gateway on the same leaf? Or perhaps a specific limitation with Cisco NX-OS?
 I was hoping to avoid having to extend all of the L3VPN constructs to the vPC VTEPs in DC1 as this is a manually managed DC (new DC is operated with Apstra) and this would increase the complexity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So if any remember my story I was a desktop support tech that ended up being single IT person for an organization as “network administrator” with a small raise with no training hand off or help. I believe I have been trying to do the job of about 5 ppl. Initially I even stayed full nighters and work next day without sleep. There was so much demand and pretty much have been treated like garbage. There have been many crying alone days and near a complete mental breakdown. I found a new job and gave my notice and what I feared would happen is happening. They will try to bully me into a consulting deal. I gave them one and a half week notice as I had not clearance yet from new job. They’re saying I have a moral obligation to stay longer to train someone since I’m the only person that knows these systems for years. I told them I will write all documentation necessary. I know they prob asked their lawyer as a lot of legal terminology is used when talking with me so that tells me they’ve been asking their in house lawyer what are their options. They tried to promise matching salary and hiring more ppl but I don’t trust them and they’re bullies. I’m glad I didn’t tell them where I’m going as I’m starting to see their ugly character hidden thinking about ways to threaten me in one way or another. Idk how they do it as I know they’ve bullied others that have resigned into something similar. But I want nothing to do with them. I need to focus on my new job. They’re saying things will break and I leave them in a very bad position.
 Any advice is appreciated to how to handle this situation. I know once I finally say no to everything they will look for ways to threaten me or get back at me or get me in the hook w signing something that will make me liable. All advice is appreciated.

It’s like every time I want to activate a phone it’s a new kind of request they have never handled before and confuses the hell out of them. Also why is the phone call quality to the phone company always so bad? AT&T Internet down? Good look using the “express ticketing” system! You need an “asset ID” to get started and as far as I can tell that information has never been provided to me. Have you ever tried navigating the AT&T portal. It may as well be in an alien language. In one location we have a smaller company that resells AT&T service and a network engineer answers the phone by the third ring. I highly recommend buying AT&T from a company with better customer service. 
 A lot of companies just want to kick the ticket back to you by always asking for more stuff. After a week of that, we usually figure out the solution on our own, or just give up. Jamf has been irritating me by doing this lately. 
 Microsoft? They have never resolved an issue for me. I don’t even try to get help from them anymore.

 First off, they're perfectly fine with telling me that an issue is my problem because "IT" yet nearly all of their equipment needs to involve me at some point. Microphone not working? Must be IT's problem. Can't pick up that person in class? IT's problem. Then they give shitty customer service when users need help with their system. Finally, send it to their "vendor" who basically does everything for them. 
 Oh, you have 30k of equipment in a shitty rack not mounted to anything with NO ventilation, and yet you wonder why your BiAmp goes berserk when it's burning itself up in the rack you spec'd, with zero space between components?
 And the arrogance... I started out remodeling auditoriums. I know the technologies they use. The issues they're trying to solve have existed for decades.
 Yet, they never report directly to IT, they report to someone who thinks their shit is magic and they are exalted from on high.
 Does anyone have good strategies to:
 1) Hold them accountable for their work product?
 2) Understand that this is a PARTNERSHIP, not an IT vs AV fight?
 3) Help their managers understand that they are not gods
 Thanks everyone for letting me blow off some steam.

 I configure the switch and everything works.
  
I add my trunk port
 I add everything to the right vlans
 I give the switch an ip address
  
And boom, internet flowing and access to everything is there!
 So I try copy running-config startup-config then reload. My configuration is gone.
 I re configure and try write memory and reoad. Then all config is gone.
 So I re config and try write mem and copy running config back to back. Every time it says it is writing the config.
 What can I look at to hopefully solve this problem? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started with a SMB that had previously employed an MSP and now am their only and first internal IT person. The MSP used Kaseya as their RMM and gave me access to it. Now that I'm wanting to move away from the MSP, I'm working on implementing our own tools to manage our devices. We are pretty much a Microsoft shop because it's what I'm familiar with. I've already enrolled all of our Windows devices in Azure/Intune and wanting to replace Kaseya. I know there are many unattended remote control solutions that would replace what I primarily use Kaseya for, but one thing I can't seem to find without an RMM is something that gives live device inventory: what PC's are currently on, users that are logged in, IP address of the PC, last reboot time, last agent check in time, and hardware details. Azure/Intune give some but not all of this. Most importantly I'd like to know what computers are on and connected and if anyone is logged in. I'm sure you can run custom scripts with Powershell and/or Microsoft Graph, but looking for something on a web interface. Is this possible with any of Microsoft tooling, and if not, what other solutions would provide what I'm looking for? I know RMM's are geared towards MSP's so simply looking for something for myself for internal use to monitor devices.

 I am a big fan of silent software installation.
 And I've been told our NAV 2018 would be OK to run as a fat client, on our client pcs.
 So I want to build a silent installation script with our configuration setup.
 But I seem to be unable to find anywhere, that states the config.xml syntax for the silent installation of the software. I even tried to ask ChatGPT - which by the way, gave me the closest to something that could potentially be the correct syntax.
 Though the syntax it gave me, was two different variations. And none of them worked, after adjusting the values to fit our environment.
 ​
 So I am hoping, that someone smarter and more experienced than me, has a template or can point me in the correct direction, to get this application installed silently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I've come to the conclusion I need some professional feedback, if I'm just lazy or come to a kinda correct conclusion. Most of our central services is already hosted by an MSP, but not this (and they don't want to).
 So we have an alarm system to mobilize our workforce in an event. Central Server; calls a list of numbers; maybe do it again. I got this system handed over with following specs: old desktop pc; 2 LineCards for connecting to a PBX via ISDN.
 Now we came to a point, where we want to have geo-redundancy and multiple tenants. In the fist meeting we came to the conclusion it would be alright elevate the pc to a VM, connect to the PBX via VoIP (which I already planed). Create a second VM do the same, connect to a second PBX and use the build-in clustering mechanic from the software. Sounds easy enough with an second MSP which is selling the software.
 So my point is: In second thought I remembered there is a cloud solution for this software. Now I'm kinda torn between self-hosting or SaaS. SaaS, would solve my and my team lacking knowledge in PBX-tech and geo-redundancy (or at least outsource it). As the system is kinda critical, I'm questioning the reliabilty of the cloud, which would be better than right now, but if we self-host we can call the internal deskphones without external calling.
 TL;DR: would you move a critical alarmingsystem to the cloud or not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peplink routers have emerged as a leading choice for businesses and individuals alike, thanks to their innovative features, reliable performance, and user-friendly interfaces. 
 One of the most distinctive features of Peplink routers is their patented SpeedFusion technology, which enables users to combine multiple internet connections for increased speed, reliability, and security. This technology allows for bandwidth bonding, seamless failover, and intelligent load balancing across different types of internet connections, such as DSL, cable, fiber, and cellular.
 I had the opportunity to choose a Peplink Balance router for multi WAN support, load balancing and failover solution, which I liked a lot, but at that time I realised that it holds a very small market niche, and it is not very popular. Peplink might not have the same level of brand recognition as some of the more prominent players in the networking industry. This could be due to a combination of factors, including limited marketing efforts, a smaller advertising budget, or the company's focus on niche markets. Consequently, many potential customers might not be aware of Peplink and its offerings.
 What's your experience with Peplink, if any?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I tried to open FACEIT's Anticheat (FACEIT is a third party matchmaking system for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) and discovered that it refuses to run unless the Process Explorer's kernel driver PROCEXP152.SYS isn't loaded (it is installed if Process Explorer is run at logon)
  
https://images2.imgbox.com/25/65/y3BdTtRF_o.png
 https://support.faceit.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014237259
  
After contacting them the answer I got was 
  
If the tool is prohibited which it seems it is, then FACEIT AC will not be able to run - this is 100% intentional. 
 Keep in mind in order to play on FACEIT you must comply with our technical requirements when it comes to FACEIT AC and we cannot make any adjustments based on individual concerns or issues.
  
and after asking the reason it is blocked
  
I'm afraid we will not disclose to you the reason behind this change for security and privacy reasons.
  
is there any vulnerability or weakness known for Process Explorer? It blocks the most recent version of it, 17.02

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a hybrid Exchange setup. Email is filtered from the Internet to our on-prem Exchange by a 3rd party email filtering service. Once email hits our internal mail servers if the recipients mailbox is in O365 the email is forwarded to O365 over a send connector. Outbound mail for on-prem users goes out through 3rd party filtering service. O365 senders mail leaves through EOP.
 I am reviewing the non-accepted domain report on the O365 Exchange admin home page and I see a large number of emails listed in this report. These emails originate from the Internet and are routed from on-prem to O365 mailboxes. I am assuming they are not being delivered but I have not heard anyone complaining yet. Unfortunately I don't have the ability to dig into the results from the report. So what I have been doing is taking the domains listed there and using message trace to track emails by the domain. I don't see anything getting blocked. Can someone explain what I am apparently missing here? Are the emails really being delivered but for some reason since it's coming from our on-prem servers they are marked as non-accepted domains? If that is the case how do I fix it?
 Thanks in advance-

We are looking for something to replace WASP. We looked at SolarWinds and it had autodiscovery tools for Macs but not for mobile devices which is the majority of our inventory along with Chromebooks. The API support for FS and Jamf is outdated and does not work like we want it to. It would be nice if the users and locations of our devices synced. FS does have an inventory system but we are mainly using it for Ticketing. Any ideas? Thanks!
 Edit: The way I'm hoping it will work is to have Jamf/Sccm/Google sync with the Inventory system and then sync all that information into FS through an API.

 What do you consider best practices in a DR plan for recovery from sleeper malware?
 For example, let's assume you have immutable backups, how long do you retain said backups for recovery? What approaches do you use to ensure the system is clean and you hit RPO with an expectation that system restores would likely come from older backups.
 What other practices and strategies do you use?

 So I'm curious what you guys use to track this news

Internal VM is hosted at 1.1.1.1. Public IP address is 2.2.2.2. Routed 2.2.2.2 to point to example.com. The URL that Gophish needs to listen should be public but can't be directly set to 2.2.2.2 when creating a campaign it should be localhost(1.1.1.1). I've got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2. My goal is when a link in the email is clicked to lead to my domain example.com?rid=516313 and to open the landing page I've configured, and when the link is clicked to somehow find its way to 1.1.1.1 through 2.2.2.2. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having issue with LTE routers, losing connection and not coming up. Cisco 1100 LTE routers.
 ​
 I built a EEM script that would reload the controller if SLA icmp check status goes down.
 ​
 I think it worked last night, but I'm wondering if it would loop and trigger again if the first try would not work. If the state needs to come 'up' again, in order for the script to run again. Not sure, and I would prefer it not to happen that we would again need to reboot the router manually for the connection to get back up.
 ​
 So here is the script. 
 !
 track 1 ip sla 1 reachability
 delay down 30 up 30
 !
 !
 ip sla 1
 icmp-echo 1.1.1.1 source-interface Vlan1
 ip sla schedule 1 life forever start-time now
 !
 !
 event manager applet Backup_Failover authorization bypass
 event track 1 state down
 action 2 cli command "enable"
 action 3 wait 2
 action 4 cli command "conf t"
 action 5 wait 2
 action 8 cli command "controller cellular 0/2/0"
 action 9 cli command "lte radio off"
 action 9.1 wait 10
 action 9.2 cli command "no lte radio off"
 action 9.3 cli command "exit"
 !
 ​
 **
 ​
 So it looks like it worked last night, but I would prefer it to rerun again if the state would not turn 'up' in 5 minutes or so. Wondering if that would happen? or does it loop as long as the state is 'down'?
 ​
 anyone good with eem scripting? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone, I am writing to get information about Windows updates. Is it possible to switch from an older version of Windows 10 (let's say 1809) to a newer one without an end of support (for example version 20H2)? I have many devices in company management on Workspace ONE and i wanted to understand if it was possible to upgrade the version. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, currently setting up a phishing campaign and need some help for the networking configuration. For example I bought the URL - example.com. Internal VM is hosted at 1.1.1.1. Public IP address is 2.2.2.2. Routed 2.2.2.2 to point to example.com. The URL that Gophish needs to listen should be public but can't be directly set to 2.2.2.2 when creating a campaign it should be localhost(1.1.1.1). I've got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2. My goal is when a link in the email is clicked to lead to my domain example.com?rid=516313 and to open the landing page I've configured, and when the link is clicked to somehow find its way to 1.1.1.1 through 2.2.2.2. Thanks!

 I turned it on and rebooted the machine. 
 After rebooting, the security badge still indicates that a reboot is required and that the machine may be vulnerable. 
 Googling the issue shows multiple people having the same problem, but the blog posts i saw talking about the same problem date back to 02/23/2023.
 Is this still an ongoing issue? Is this a bug in the newest Microsoft update?

 We currently use withsecure EDR which gives us the ability to block various downloads through a browser plugin. If we decided to switch to another EDR product without this feature, is there any third party tool which can do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have decided to go "fresh" and use Mailgun for a new project, but so far I'm having a terrible experience with deliverability. Things are so bad, that I get "Relay access denied", when I try to even mail my own Gmail account or Domain.
 But the best part is, when I have created a ticket, they have told me first to check my DNS (I did), and next "they can do nothing about it", I should contact Gmail myself.
 Let me get straight: I'm paying you money and you tell me I need to do your work and fix your deliverability issues?
 That's not the first time we opened tickets. In the past months multiple times we have caught them being randomly flagged as spammers, or detecting "unexplainable relay access denied" errors in our mail.log.
 We are using exactly the same tech stack and we never saw these errors with Sendgrid.
 Is Mailgun really so bad, or I am doing something wrong?
 Honestly, at this point I'm looking for an alternative (Stripe is not an option, due to local regulation).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I saw a video about new Intel Xeons from Linus Tech Tips. My jaw dropped when he said they are going the chiplet route like AMD since I was afraid they will do that.
 Pretty much all of our clients use Oracle Standard 2 on Intel hardware for our product. We can't use AMD because if licensing. Essentially if you have an AMD Epyc with four chiplets, you need FOUR CPU LICENSES. Yes, really. Which means you would need the Enterprise edition which costs more than I want to know (ranges of tens of thousands of Euros).
 Now that Intel does the same, there are multiple options.
 a) Oracle will change their licensing (highly unlikely) to allow chiplets
 b) It will not apply to the Intel implementation (it is a bit different to AMD)
 c) We start working immediately on moving our product from Oracle
 d) Our customers will need to just buy old, pre 2023 servers. This sucks because at some point supply will dry out.

 Even if they remove an IP from their list, they seem to block another one instead...
 Also you have to enter your name and company details for every lookup or removal request. This is very annoying.
 On the Website are no contact details at all. Just on the Validity website you can fond a form to enter your contact details so a sales rep can contact you. There is not even a field to enter details or a description.

I have to implement a speed test server with packet loss and ftp test. The argument from the client is that http is a stateless protocol but ftp is a stateful protocol and http will be hampered by the time it needs to reconnect with the server.
 I found that major browsers recently end the supports for ftp and most js ftp clients are in nodejs. So I'm wondering whether it is still possible to connect to ftp server using js. Any web technology that will be able to do that, like web workers, websocket, webRTC?
 If web technology is impossible to do, what are the other options? Thanks and really appreciate any advice.

 We have a very small standalone site with about 20 users where they are adamant about only having one server to manage.They don’t want to virtualize it and run separate machines as VM guests either. One server only.
 However it’s not recommended to add additional roles such as print servers to domain controllers. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment-print-spooler
 Same for file server and WSUS.
 Is there any equivalent to SBS in 2023 that’s supported for running a domain controller plus other roles on the same server?
 The only thing I can think of would be to configure direct IP printing, configure updates from Windows updates online and using SharePoint Online using a spare workstation for hosting any needed local file shares for things not hosted in SharePoint Online..
 Also, at this point, they are not interested in Azure joining workstations and getting rid of the domain.

In the process, we are wanting to put a bridge between the firewall and the ISP so we can take advantage of the extra IPs in a /29 or /28 if needed. I've recommended managed switches for these locations as many of them are automated sites with no personnel. I'm getting pushback on 2 issues. Our security consultant is recommending we put in unmanaged switches. They are cheaper, they can't be compromised from the Internet (cue scary music) and if a redundant link goes out you just ship out another cheap switch. Secondly, if we did go with the managed switch option, he is insisting that the OOB mgmt port doesn't plug into our trusted network but instead goes through the firewall. Apparently plugging it straight into the trusted network would immediately cause a security audit to fail. Thoughts on these 2 items?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
 I have a questions regarding Cisco Anyconnect VPN and blocking certain ports / protocols out to the internet.
 Currently our VPN is full tunnel and we have ACL objects defining what systems / servers they can get to on-premise via our inside interface. How do we go about controlling what clients on the Anyconnect VPN access outbound to the internet? Is there a specific ACL i need to apply for this?

 I'm trying to plug a 1G/10G dual rate LR sfp+ into a 100/1000 SFP port, and it seems to work. My port comes up, but the remote 3rd party is seeing low Rx light (-35dBm) and it's showing as down for them. Auto-neg seems to be successfull.
 My device is a Juniper SRX1500.
 I think this suggests a L1 issue so need to check patches/crossconnects, but just wanted to specifically ask if an SFP port can take a Dual-Rate SFP+ transceiver.

 I am looking to get some second opinions from you guys -- so thank you in advance! 
 We are a network with about 300 stacks and we are currently documenting what ports are patched where with spreadsheets. 
 From the research we have done, it does not seem apparent that there is a great solution to the documentation of the specifics of what is patched where, but rather focusing on identifying what device is connected, etc. 
 We are using Cisco switches. Any advice for what I could further look into, or what tools you all use, for tracking and documenting patches? 
 Thanks! -W

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are quoting a customer to move from direct Microsoft Enterprise Agreement to our CSP/MSP. I tried posting in the MSP sub and didn't get any replies. Today they have a line item for a product called "Exchange Online P1 SU Exchange Online Kiosk Per User" with SKU "TRA-00065". This customer is not government and insist that Microsoft agrees this is OK for them to use. This product is confusing as they should not exist on the same line regardless. At a high level, Exchange OnLine kiosk has 2gb, EOL plan 1 has 50gb, and EOL plan 2 has 100gb. I googled and found this same product name and SKU in the wild for several government entities, such as https://www.coquitlam.ca/DocumentCenter/View/9568/23-036-RFIQ---Microsoft-Enterprise-Agreement-Renewal-and-Software-License-Management?bidId=
 The goal of this product was to increase their F3s to have 50GB inboxes, which aligns to Exchange Online Plan 1. I am unable to compete as they are paying almost $1 for this product. Has anyone run into this before or can otherwise decode why/how kiosk and plan1 are combined into one product? Any other thoughts appreciated!

Obviously, pay was not good but I reckon that the mental stability that the job overall provided was much more important. Almost everyone came from a private background too, so they knew what a golden job they had gotten. 
 The things I do in one day at my current job by myself, it was done in weeks with a team, if not months (some minor upgrades, or deployments for example). The slower pace of the job actually benefitted everyone’s mental and physical health, and people seemed happier for a fact. Anyways, I’m nearly mentally drained and I hope to get back in the public sector hopefully sooner than later

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to see if anything exists for a digital hardware acknowledgement form. From what I have found, nothing can do this. I have tried Adobe Sign but do not see a way to pull in information from either an Excel document, SharePoint list, or any other source, specifically Azure/Intune/EPM.
 Basically, I have a .csv of users and devices and I want to send out hardware acknowledgements to each of them, where they can either sign or approve. 
 I have tried Power Automate, Microsoft Word (mail merge) and now Adobe Sign to no avail. 
 Are you guys still doing paper forms, or how are you handling deploying new hardware and having users sign off on it?

 I'm relatively young in the IT space. Started my first real job around the XP end of life. It seems like every OS update, Microsoft takes away all the functional shit real IT people would use, then slowly just adds it all back over the next 2 to 3 years. Then after that it's acceptable and that's when I switch. Same story with 10 and 8. 
 It's crazy this multi billion dollar company goes through the same cycle every time. Why? Just my morning shower thought.

 Is there any way to only allow 365 phishing protection to continue to work via a mail flow rule or similar, with Barracuda in place? I had notifications turned on each time a phishing email was allowed by override, that's how I found out this was happening. Barracuda doesn't seem to be doing a very good job with these, also have their impersonation protection which also kind of sucks.

 The trick is I cannot install anything on the laptop the vendor needs access too. All solutions seem to need that agent. 
 The only glimmer I have found is Teams allows this with Edge, one day, but not yet. 
 So I am looking for any solutions you have run across that would require no agent installs, on the laptop and allow in remote access to keyboard in a pretty restrictive environment. Think DOD kind of restrictive. 
 Webex, Chrome Remote Desktop, Bomgar all are out as they require agents and installs.

 Psexec is quite terrible because we have to push a new version of the application and handle problems with machines that are offline.
 I'm one of the developers of the application and we are currently trying to find a tool that would help us update the application and potentially take care of restarting it in the case of an error. I would guess that there must be many tools specifically designed for this kind of problem but I cannot find anything.
 Note that I'm not searching for a tool that can manage and install all the applications on the machine (Azure Intune, PDQDeploy). That is the job of our infrastructure team and I don't want to invade their work.

 Can someone recommend me some resources on becoming a better on-call engineer? How to prioritize better, how to handle incidents and not getting overwhelmed all the time with the alerts or errors thrown at me by Icinga or any other monitoring tool.
 Probably the easiest way would be to renegotiate the terms of the contract, so I wouldn't be put in an on-call rotation, but honestly for me that feels like being not fully qualified to do my job and makes my impostor syndrome kick me even harder.
 Do you guys have any suggestions for me?

 The ticketing system does not handle this well and spreadsheets are a mess. I absolutely hate using access because it is not in the cloud but it does everything I need as a single person, and in less than an hour I can go to database that will show me a dashboard of what I want to know and generate reports.
 I know there's so many cloud options right now but every time I try something new there's something that is not quite straight forward and takes more time to figure out and just leaning on my old trusty Microsoft Access skills. I wish I had time to learn as there are so many cool cloud tools these days, and sure if a customer is interested in a specific product I will learn everything about it and become an expert in it. In this case I'm falling back on access because I've already spent too much time dabbling in Microsoft Teams, messing around with building a small ticketing system within to organize tracking packages. When it comes to learning more for the sake of non-tangible endeavors it is often put on the back burner.
 And I'm not wasting time posting this because I can walk my dog and ponder at the same time.

 This seems to have worked and my ISO states the following:

 Yet when I run setup.exe the installer will tell me that the language is not the same and thus I cant keep my files and settings, am I missing something here? Does some specific language translation file need to be merged?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently discovered that Exchange Online transport rules, which includes mailbox forwarding configurations, forwards messages before EOP content filtering. The design decision overall makes sense, it’s just not optimal for some use cases. The end-result for forwarding to third-party systems, like Zendesk, is that messages flagged as phishing still get forwarded to the external system because the forward occurs before the content filtering by design. Some of these third-party systems have far less sophisticated content filtering that EOP.
 Short of implementing a legacy-style content filter, where you change your MX records, in front of our entire exchange environment, any ideas on how to forward messages after content filtering? We are also open to paid services as part of a solution, if there isn’t a good way to do it in the native Exchange Online platform.

 I'm new to the job and in charge of the ERP side of applications and so there's an MSP whose been here years and stays for back ups and such. I'm also responsible for them. This works since it gives me time to focus on business applications kind of thing and avoids 2am phone calls.
 The company has always bought the M365 licenses through the MSP and I'm not too cool with this. I am thinking we shouldn't be tied to them like this. I am looking at Dell as a license reseller, they are cheaper too. Naturally the MSP has all sorts of issues with this.
 Do you all prefer to be more provider/vendor agnostic? What do you think on this topic?

 ​
 I need to do a project for school and wanted to set up a WDS because we also need one at my company. 
 ​
 I'm completely new to this and only knew about WDS but today I saw an article about MDT and that I should use this instead of WDS for creating the imagen using WDS only for the PXE boot.
 ​
 We have many different clients ranging from Lawyers to construction companies. I wanted to create an image for every company and boot via PXE so that I only have to choose an image and then the PC should install and set up everything by itself (programs, settings, domain, pc-name, etc). The user should only log in and start working.
 ​
 My questions are:
 ​
 -is that possible?
 ​
 -what exactly are the differences between the two? Why should I use MDT over WDS?
 ​
 -what would be the best way to set that up?
 ​
 -does that work wih Windows 11 images?
 ​
 -do you know some good up-to-date articles I could use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23397 
 With CVE-2023-23397, the attacker sends a message with an extended MAPI-property with a UNC-path to a SMB-share on the attacker-controlled server. No user interaction is required. The exploitation can be triggered as soon as the client receives the email.
 The connection to the remote SMB-server sends the user's NTLM negotiation message, which will leak the NTLM hash of the victim to the attacker who can then relay this for authentication against other systems as the victim.
 Exploitation has been seen in the wild.
 This should be patched in the latest release but if needed, the following workarounds are available:
  
Add users to the Protected Users Security Group. This prevents the use of NTLM as an authentication mechanism. NOTE: this may cause impact to applications that require NTLM. 
 Block TCP 445/SMB outbound form your network by using a Firewall and via your VPN settings. This will prevent the sending of NTLM authentication messages to remote file shares.

Both are populated with FIPS 140-2 validated self encrypting drives so data at rest is encrypted. When one array does block level replication to the other array, does the data remain encrypted while in transit? 
 My assumption is yes since there's no need for block level replication to understand any of the file contents in order to function. So it's just sending 4K chunks of previously encrypted 1s and 0s over the network. 
 Can one of you experts help enlighten me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning have become increasingly important in practically every aspect of our lives. Based on these technologies, there are also promising identity and access control strategies. But what function do they truly play in identity and access management?
 The use of artificial intelligence to find anomalies in user behavior is one strategy being studied in this context. Algorithms examine user activity within a system and spot any unexpected behaviors that might point to a security problem. In this approach, possible assaults can be discovered and countered at an early stage.
 In the area of authentication, there are also interesting methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Systems that examine a user's voice or behavior to confirm their identification are one example of this. With no further user action required, high security authentication can be accomplished in this way.
 The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in identity and access management is, however, being questioned by certain critics. One explanation for this is the possibility of faults with these technology. Users may be mistakenly blocked or unauthorized users may obtain access to secured systems as a result of a flawed system.
 How do you feel? What role do artificial intelligence and machine learning play in identity and access management? Are they a risk or a promising technology? What strategies are already in use, and where do you see room for advancement?

 https://i.imgur.com/dA6U0St.jpg
 Background: i am working for an IT company. To be able to install email app and other company related apps that are in Microsoft, I need to install this profile in my phone.
 I read the privacy fine prints before installation.
 It says, if this is company smartphone, company will know all apps I installed and has full control
 If its “personal smartphone”, which is in my case, they can only manage company-related apps that are installed thru company portal and will not have access on my photos and other apps on my phone. But they have access to the info about my phone (model, serial number etc)
 So I understood the difference, however upon checking the Manage Profile itself, which in the photo above, it seems that its more than that. It feels like i am giving the full control of my phone.
 I wanna ask network administrators here what can you really see when someone installed company portal and installed this kind of management profile on their phones.
 I understood by definition (at least the info they disclosed) the limit of what can be accessed but i would also like to know how possible it is to get all information (photos in cloud, list of all apps installed etc.) if a company network administrator will intentionally try to access everything using the management profile installed.

 Currently we (SP) are planning IPv6 support for our customers. Currently we are running an IPv4-only MPLS core and connecting customers using L3VPN blah. blah. After researching it seems there are 2 possible methods, either keeping it easy and keep running IPv4 core and implementing 6VPE or Dual stacking the core and run IPv6 with SRv6 while keeping IPv4 next to it. The 2nd one looks like such an headache as we do not have segment routing implemented in our IPv4 core but looks more futureproof.
 Is the 2nd option even plausible? and if it is could anyone here with some more experience in usage tell me why "you" would choose one over the other? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[good morning,
 i am studying self encrypting drives, and a functionality is to only use the dek function without an external password or Auth Key...but i am a bit confused...what is usable for security if leave only dek enabled ?
 this article says...
 https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/self-encrypting-drives
 " We know what you're thinking. If your data isn't being fully protected, then what's the point of even buying an SED? Does this mean that an SED can be hacked?
 Well, given that SEDs encrypt your data and store its DEK internally, you're still being protected from common software-level attacks that seek to steal, alter, or delete your most sensitive data. "
 dont get it...what protection can give me a basic dek only based sed disk?
 thank you

 I'm trying to run WordPress in a clustered setup on a 3 node Docker Swarm cluster and a MariaDB Galera cluster. However, the servers I'm using are very small and don't have a lot of RAM/CPU.
 I've tried using Gluster and Ceph to sync or distribute WordPress files between the servers, but it resulted in website response times that were 10x longer. As a result, I'm currently using Syncthing to sync the mounted folder between the servers since it doesn't impact read performance.
 I was wondering if anyone had any advice on a better way to set this up given the limited resources of the servers. Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm having an issue with some users.
 We are using Exchange Servers, and Outlook client for Windows.
 Sometimes, we have to remove users from our AD, since they are leaving the company. Our AD is synced to the Exchange Servers, and so, if the account is deleted, everything linked is deleted too.
 BUT, in the Outlook client, if someone still has the calendar from the deleted user, in his shared calendars, then Outlook will keep trying to connect to this calendar, then prompt the user for a password, and eventually not sync his Outlook anymore because it can't load this specific removed calendar.
 Is there anyway to monitor this ? Some users have +50 loaded calendars, and finding deleted ones is kinda messy... I don't know, that's why I'm asking. :)

 We have been following this guide Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network - Microsoft Support however when we enable this verbatim, we find the the 'override block rules' aspect of this doesn't appear to work and our connectivity to our DC's breaks.

 Hypervisor: VMware ESXi 7.0.3J
 Hypervisor Management: VMware vCenter 7.0.3 Patch 19717403

 File Server: Windows Server 2019
 We use FSlogix profiles for the user management with profile redirection and managed Start and Desktop. 
 All holy hell broke loose when i released the update FSLogix 2210 (2.9.8361.52326), we were getting a black screen for users on logon, but as this was a managed change, we did this first in a test environment. However this consists of 15 users to ensure full testing complete. (Barring in mind they are 500+ users strong) 
 Well after much deliberation, i came across this fix through Microsoft forums! god forbid it took me 2 days after they posted it, to find it! 
 FSLogix Release Notes - FSLogix | Microsoft Learn 
 This fixed my issue with the latest update, but so you don't have too! i thought i would throw this out there and prevent a potential disaster elsewhere!

 Can they do that?
 I know for a fact that Edgeswitch devices, while they can't pack Q-in-Q and on paper do not support Q-in-Q. However if you pack the Q-in-Q on two other devices that support Q-in-Q, a Edgeswitch will happily transport the Q-in-Q without issues.

 ​
 I have 5 users out of 2000 on Full Azure AD with never ending issues. Intune isn't Enterprise grade yet, but we are being forced to go to it due to Microsoft removing features or making legacy onprem features hard to manage going forward or not adding new features.
 The next low hanging fruit on the issue tracker is Wi-Fi.
 We have 3 Wi-Fi networks.
  
CompanyWifi
 CompanyGuest
 CompanyBYOD
  
How can I block using Intune the ability to connect or see CompanyGuest and CompanyBYOD
 In GPO I just create the profile and add the guest and BYOD to blocked list and click don't view blocked wireless networks. I know it works because I have it right now working.
 Even with the CORP profile deployed via Intune it doesn't automatically reconnect sometimes and they just see the CompanyNameGUEST and assume its correct. As the GUEST password is on the board room they can connect. 
 They then create support tickets saying network shares, apps and things aren't working. The Guest and BYOD are on different VLANS and are blocked from accessing internal resources. I have told them not to connect to Guest or BYOD but ignore me. 
 We have had 25 cases so far this year just from the 5 Full Azure AD users regarding Wi-Fi and not able to access stuff and us finding they are on the wrong Wi-Fi. If we extrapolate that over 1000 odd users, we will get a shit load of tickets.
 This was such a simple thing in Group Policy but looks like moving to Intune and the Modern way is costing us more time for support and costing more money as we now need to licence everything and loosing essential features.

 I have a star tech USB to IDE reader and have taken the drive and plugged it into win 11 hoping to use macrium and image it. To my chagrin, and what I should have realized, is I guess win 11 will not read fat16 and it says it's a 2tb drive that needs to be initialized. Obviously that would wipe the data so that wouldn't work.
 Tldr: Need to backup and old dos 6.2 machine and realized that win 11 wouldn't read the data. Pls help. I'm assuming linux would do it, but am unsure how.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, long time lurker but first time posting.
 I have a Supermicro server with 24 bays and almost exactly half of the drives don't work. From the RAID card BIOS they read as 0/00 size, and the card refuses to pass them through to the OS. I've even tried them in my personal rig (LSI-9750) and it spits out a "Not supported" error. I've tried the drives in 3 different servers, with 4 different RAID cards and I'm at a loss here.
 I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone has had something similar. The most I've found is incompatibility with 520 byte formatted drives but I'm at a loss here.
 Let me know what you all think, I can post pictures as well if needed.

 Our IT team is a helpdesk of 4, 3 system and network admins.
 We've got a lot of systems. On top of your basic infrastructure (AD domain controllers, wired network, wireless network, storage servers, virtualization servers, backup and replication, firewall, etc. etc.) we're also managing, Microsoft 365 tenant (Azure AD, SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive etc. Loads of admin work with no one dedicated to looking after it all), two MDM platforms for all devices (Jamf for Mac, InTune for Windows machines, again without a dedicated person to look after it), logging and monitoring system, cyber security, and countless other systems and infra that seems to just be growing.
 What's it like in your organization? Is there someone who's role is to look after specific components of IT, or at least an SME for each component? For a while now it's just felt like help desk is running around mad trying to put out fires (users who can't connect, machines that dont have correct software, incorrect permissions, general computer issues, etc.) And then the system and network admins just get dragged into helping, meaning that any project work (and there's a lot) is borderline impossible to devote attention to

 we own the phones and are looking to move to a new provider. Our budget is tight and the ceo hates spending on networking. I noticed if we let the new provider lease us switches we end up paying $4200 over 5 years for two Extreme networks 210-24 port units that we dont get to keep at the end.
 for that price I figured we might as well get an aruba instant on 1960 48 port poe version. Then eventually another 48 port non poe. then I can roll out some of the POE thin…]]></summary>

Also they are not giving much discount even with a big purchase. So we look into other vendors like Aruba, Extreme and Huawei. So for those who worked with multiple of those vendors how do you compare them?

Even if I try to generate a CSR for the same url, it creates my certificate and it appears in the local certificates list but it's not validated.
 Should I just go for another SCEP solution? Isn't the cisco router capable of sending certificates to Fortigate firewalls?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having trouble with a laptop wireless connection to an Epson projector. Originally, both the laptop and projector were connected to the office network over the same ssid at the main router. The projector is assigned a static IP address, which allows the laptop to connect to it over the router. However, something is causing a huge amount of lag in the connection. The router appears to be working fine for all other devices, however for the projector connection there is tremendous lag at times. My solution for this was to purchase a wireless access point. So now I am trying to connect the projector to the network through the access point (with a different ssid) while the laptop remains on the main ssid. In this configuration the laptop cannot find the projector. The projector successfully connects to the network with its static IP, however on the laptop side it can’t be found. I thought that as long as the projector IP remained the same, it would not matter how the projector connects to the network for it to communicate with the laptop. What am I missing?

 Also just to provide clarity we test with 1 ICMP per 60 seconds, nothing terribly overwhelming, I wouldn't imagine we'd hit any kind of DDOS threshold.

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

 I’m hoping someone can guide me in the right direction as we’ve hit a bit of a brick wall.
 We’re using Apple Business Manager & MDM (Microsoft Intune). Within Microsoft Intune we have blocked access for syncing, Apple ID’s and iCloud for regulatory reasons.
 I’ve been asked how to get contacts from an Android device onto an iPhone device, however, after looking almost everywhere it’s either a case of it needing some form of Apple ID/iCloud, it not supporting MDM devices, or it being a contact-by-contact process, which isn’t scalable.
 Does anyone have any form of alternatives?
 Kind Regards,
 Max

 I'm moving some devices from a 3rd party print software, I've made the access/nat rules needed, it works for the 800 other devices I've pushed this to.
 The only ones that aren't working properly are the fiber locations. I've tried to test from shell using 9100 and it fails. Rules are standard across the board for all 800 locations.
 Does fiber just use a different port for printing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm out of options here, so I'd love to pick some brains from people who are wiser than me here. Has anyone else noticed the atrocious behavior of M365 Apps, specifically Outlook, on the Dell Latitude 3500's? I've had anything from the application simply not opening, to it disconnecting from exchange, and other spontaneous issues. Everything stays up to date and it seems to only affect our 3500's, not our Latitude 5000's. The only way solutions I've found are rebuilding the Outlook profile, M365 repairs, and if all else fails a user profile rebuild. 
 I don't mind doing my job and fixing these issues, but it's getting to the point where I'm just genuinely having my time wasted with users having the same Outlook issues over and over again. Hell, I've even completely wiped and redeployed a machine and that same issue happened again. Microsoft has been no help and recent updates have done nothing. 
 This is such a simple tier I/II issue that I'm genuinely just getting my time wasted on. I'm tired of running a repair or rebuild every two weeks.
 So, basically, have you guys encountered this? If so, have you found any other reliable fixes?
 Also, if you think I should copy this to another sub Reddit, let me know.

 I've wondered if we should move the PDC FSMO role to another DC the day before we do maintenance to that server. 
 If it goes wrong you don't have to do an AD authoritative restore, just a regular one. If it runs into issues the pressure is off to resolve them. Depending on size of forest it's could be more than 1 day.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had an issue last week after installing the February 2023 update (KB502289) on 4 separate devices running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 that I wanted to pass along, because I haven't been able to find any similar issues out there.
 I believe this actually began back in October/November when we started seeing daily incidences of NETLOGON error 5719 (that we only noticed now, in hindsight). A couple of days after installing KB502289, users complained about data shares not being accessible. We noticed that the ACLs on each server weren't listing domain members, and that led to figuring out that the secure channel/trust relationship was now broken on each of these servers.
 Tried multiple fixes including:
  
rolling back update KB502289
 Secure Channel repair
 domain unjoin/rejoin
  
None worked, and we ended up just moving the data off of the servers (as we had planned to retire them later this year anyway) and re-creating the shares. We're still not 100% certain how this could have been remedied if we were forced to keep the servers in production.
 I'm fairly certain that this issue was caused in some part due to Netlogon protocol changes/hardening but I can't prove it, and I'm somewhat concerned about how this could end up affecting other servers in our enterprise further down the line. I know this Netlogon hardening is considered a KABOOM so I've been trying to mitigate against issues, but wasn't anticipating this one.

 I am trying to figure out a good system to achieve the following design:
 ​
 I have a plethora of clients that give me VPN access to their individual sites. I would like to have my own VPN server on each site, that allows my computer to connect to each site, on demand (not an always-on system) but have it in a reverse connection fashion (so the client does not need to setup port forwarding and IP assignments on their public interface).
 ​
 I was looking into OpenVPN appliance, with a reverse connection policy.
 ​
 Has anybody had a similar scenario they needed to achieve? Thank you for any replies with help.

I tried to make a dynamic route between the devices' fiber ports but somehow it wont work. Logs are flapping between exchange and down and the reason is too many transmissions. I searched in the internet and the solution I only find is MTU mismatch or MTU misconfig. I tried to fix this problem but the adjacency still doesnt form and logs are still flapping between exchange and down. What do you think is the reason behind this? This is my first time handling inter-vendor routing. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First exposure to recruiters from abroad:
 Approached by a recruiter based in the UK, who found me on a business related social media site. 
 Agreed to talk about the offer: company/role/wage etc. Company is local to me (not UK)
 After our talk he sen't me an e-mail wanting me to reply by copy-pasting a text he appended:
 "I, {my name} confirm that {recruiter name} of {recruiter company} has discussed the role of {job title} at {company they want to refer me to} and confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative.
 I understand {recruiter company} are passing my basic details and CV to {company they want to refer me to} on my behalf and are doing so with my express agreement. The Data Privacy and Retention Policy of {company they want to refer me to} is available from {link to company they want to refer me to} {company they want to refer me to}."
 ​
  
The "confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative" + no time limit for how long is fishy to me. If it were only for the company he's selling me to, I wouldn't really mind though.
 But is it really meant that way? What if I don't accept the role? Would I need to terminate the contract with him/them being my sole representative?
 The link goes to the homepage of {company they want to refer me to}, where I couldn't find the Data Retention Policy. I can understand why they need to refer to the {company they want to refer me to}'s Data Retention policy, since they send my CV over, but wouldn't it make more sense to link to the {recruiter company} Data Privacy and Retention Policy? Or both?
  
Is this BS? Am I being overly cautious? 
 Thank you

 As far as RAM and processing power, to have a enterprise environment running with switches , routers, firewall and clients. That should be more than enough RAM to push through?
 I know it depends on how large the environment is , but realistically just to have enough power for run at least a moderate enterprise environment with the listed above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. We have a request from a client to find a solution that does BOTH patch management (Microsoft patches but also 3rd party apps patches) and vulnerability scanning for about 500 pcs. So far the only thing that I could find that does these things is Languard, but after a few days of testing the trial I'm not confident to recommend this. It's very slow, freezes a lot, agent deployment does not work 99% of the time, looks very dated, etc.
 I really liked Rapid 7's Insight VM for vulnerability assessment but this doesn't do patch management and the client doesn't want 2 sepparate apps... There's also Qualys that would work and I like it, but they have huge prices, it's enterprise level solution.
 So, in a nutshell, do you know of any solution that can do what I need and doesn't cost my weight in gold? 
 Thank you!

January people complain about not beeing able to share their screen. This only happens solely on Surface pro 7. You plug in the usb dongle, click the .exe on the usb share but nothing happens.
 Funny sidenote: it works with all guest devices, it works with our lenovo notebooks, it works with surface book 2, only about 30 Surface Pro 7 dont work.
 We use CS-100 and CS-200 and appropiate Clickshare Buttons, all on the latest firmware.Windows Version is 20H2, soon 22H2 on all machines, also no GPO that prevents USB since it works on all other devices. We are really struggling atm - no eventlog nor barco log show problems. We tried deleting local profiles, we downgraded firmware...
 Does anyone experience the same?

 All our users have a laptop with always on vpn. We split tunnel some stuff like teams/onedrive to not kill our internet connection. Normal web traffic goes trough the vpn and firewall rules.
 Lately we are detecting large amount of traffic from alot of windows 10 laptops to some ip bloks. Mostly 8.238.22.x, 8.238.23.x, 8.238.177.x, 8.238.179.x and 152.199.21.x ranges. It show as port 80 webtraffic and they are big data blocks and causes our internet connection to clog up. Also we are europe based and the ip blocks seem to be from usa. (nsa stop spying!!! :p ) We can kill it with firewall rules but we need to get to the source of this.
 Stuf we tried/considerd.
  
It all started pretty much at the same time and only are win10 laptops.
 Checked if we missed ip block update from microsoft but that is not the case.
 Tried to find something about the ip's but can not find anything more than Level 3 communications.
 Ran malware bytes on laptops confirmed they had this problem and nothing found
 When a range is blocked at some point the laptop stops trying to connect.
  
Anny and all tips would be very welcome. At the moment I am trying to get my hands on a laptop that showing this so i can try to see if I can get the proces with netstat but at the moment no luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the longest time I have been terrible at linking a title with something - this goes for anything, examples such as:
 - Names for people
 - Titles for subjects
 - Area names like street names, site areas, ect...
 I am generally quite intelligent and managed to get by with this limitation as although I struggle with the titles, the knowledge I pick up quite quickly. However, as an IT apprentice this has been effecting me more and more, especially for my portfolio.
 For my portfolio I have to fill out a KSB table (Knowledge Skills and Behaviours) where I have met each topic, e.g. applying the appropriate skills/techniques for secure working. Every time I go to look at it I feel a little overwhelmed and not sure where to start due to this weakness. 
 Moreover, when providing on site support, as I am first/second line support, it can be difficult for me knowing where things are. Although I know where users are as I have learned their names after being there a while, if someone says one of the clock in machines isn't working I have to get them to describe where rather than just saying the area name.
 I wasn't entirely sure where on reddit to ask this, so if there is a better place please advise me :) However, I thought this would be a good place as my issues are effecting my ability in my career and I am sure someone else has likely experienced this.

 ​
 So I'm looking into an issue with a few surface pro 9s where the on screen keyboard doesn't auto appear even when there's no typercover or keyboard attached. It doesn't even seem to detect tablet mode. I've tried playing about with all the settings that should enable the touch keyboard but don't know what else to try. 
 ​
 Has anyone had this issue before and managed to fix it? The machines were built with SCCM so maybe it could be an issue with the image, GPOs or something in the task sequence.

 My question is : Has anyone had any problems after changing this hardening?

 Vulnerability :
 ​
 Description 
 ​
 When non-privileged users can link GPOs at the Domain Controllers OU level, they havetheability to effect change on domain controllers as well as potentially elevate access and change domain-wide security posture. This indicator looks for non-default principals who have write permissions on the GPLink attribute or Write DACL/Write Owner on the object. Likelihood of Compromise Just being able to link GPOs doesn't provide the whole picture. An attacker would need to find or edit a GPO that contains the instructions they want to achieve. However, i fan attacker can find an existing GPO that meets their needs, then having this write permission gives them thekeys to the kingdom. Result Found 1 objects with write permissions on the GPLink attributeat the Domain Controller OU level.

I thought that if I try to install the 2022-01 monthly rollup patch, it will give an error that says "update not applicable" since a latest monthly rollup patch is already installed - but for some reason it did not and I was still able to install the old patch.

 Would there be any changes in terms of security by installing a much older patch? I now wonder what changes would there be by installing an older patch?

 ​
 I've got my SC-200 this Friday, previously attempted it and failed by 1 or 2 marks, I got 684 and needed 700 :(
 ​
 Work gave me a 2nd exam voucher and I realised we also have access to measure-up for free so I've been going through the 117 Qs they have but am I better using exam dumps? Measure-up offer money back guarantees if you can hit 90% in succession (confident I can do this easily with practice) but would I be better spending my time on the exam dumps instead? 
 For dumps my colleague recommended Prof-IT (work subsidised buying this so I have access to both options).
 Overall I find Measure-up better personally in terms of interaction/gui/features.
 ​
 Any thoughts welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi 
 We are a small MSP who seem to run into problems, when we are experiencing more complicated issues with our customers' different copiers. These are issues that seems to relate to their drivers and the interaction with the rest of the network/print server ecosystem. 
 Our experience when contacting the different Copier/Printer suppliers is mostly rejections saying that the issue is with our systems - e.g. once we had a technician connect a laptop directly to the ethernet port on a copier, print a page and conclude that there was not a problem printing to their device. While I can understand the technician's point of view, in regards to his domain with technical support of the copier itself, I am guessing it is fairly few organizations who buy a copier for one person to connect directly to it via ethernet cable.
 Other times they will say we can only use one specific driver without further explanation, even though their own company supplies both Universal and PCL and PS variants.
 We try of course to be diligent in our testing and problem solving, but when we cannot find fault in our systems, we need somebody to turn to. It seems it is very hard to get the suppliers of Copiers/Printers to take what seems to be issues with their drivers and the interaction with other IT systems seriously?
 So I am asking for advice on how you handle issues with copiers, where you have tested different configurations in regards to network, server setup and drivers with no luck
  
Do you buy special support from the copier/printer manufacturers?
 Do you have a secret hotline?
 Any other tips?
  
Thank you!

Can I set it up on the local roundcube?
 So e.g. the local Sieve in manageing the filter option if set up in roundcube, like thunderbird would do it? 
 Currently I just get a timeout or couldn't connect to managedSieve server and I wonder if this is even possible or not.

 ​
 -> The AP is putting clients in the VLAN 100 where they get a DHCP address. So far so good.
 -> When I change the vlan to VLAN 200 untagged on the switch port, all clients immediatly ask for a new DHCP address and get an address in the VLAN 200 DHCP scope. 
 -> My questions are: Why is this the case? The lease time is 8 hours, so shouldn't the clients at least keep the address for 4h before asking for a new one? Or has this something to do with the clients not being able to reach their gateway in VLAN 100 anymore and therefore asking for a new address?

 As I understand, it is entirely possible to configure on-premise only WHFB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-cert-trust-adfs
 ​
 My question is -
  
Once I enable ADFS as the CRA, and configure DNS for device registration - who/which devices will be prompted to register?
 Can I allow/enforce registration only for domain-joined devices, and all other devices will just authenticate as usual without using WHFB?
  
​
 I'm trying to 'allow' WHFB in my organization, but not to 'enforce it'.
 Because not everyone who will authenticate against my ADFS are using a domain-joined laptop.
 We want to allow WFHB for domain-joined corporate devices, while those logging in from their personal devices (non-domain joined or even joined to someone else's AAD) are not prompted to register (since the registration would fail, as we are on-prem only).
 ​
 i.e. if you try to access https://intranet from a domain device, you are prompted to register/use WHFB
 if you try to access https://intranet from a personal non-domain device, you are not prompted to register and can just use 'regular login'

 EDIT: I have just thought why my question does make sense
 I was told to install the software onto my domain laptops in a kind of monitoring mode before enabling 'Require Approval = ON', but if that then makes all my standard users local admins this is not good.
 So, if Admin by request is installed on to a stanadrd users account and I then leave it in moniotor mode, which is,
 Allow run as admin = on
 Require Approval = off
 Does this kind of make all standard users local admin users until approval is enabled?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon.
 ​
 Can someone help with configuring Extreme AP410 via the cli. I need to configure wi-fi with authorization indication using WPA Enterprise specifying AAA radius. And also please explain how you can configure the vlan for a specific ssid. For example, I want the ssid "test_vlan_100" to be accessed in vlan 100.
 ​
 Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working in IT for well over a decade, almost all of it being help desk. My current role is a mid-tier system engineer role for almost a year. Most of what I do is user account management, a little data center support, exchange 2010, shared drive access management, airwatch/WS1, and some other light system duties. I am very interested in endpoint engineering with O365, Intune, SCCM, Exchange Online, and Azure.
 I have done some work in O365 and Intune from a help desk role a couple jobs ago. My current company will be migrating to O365 later this year, with me being part of the migration.
 A friend recommended a powershell book and I started building scripts for some exchange tasks.
 I haven't used SCCM itself, I used KACE and Empirum. I reached out to one of the engineers to show me SCCM and she's going to let me shadow her for software packaging and pushes.
 Besides just shadowing others, what are some resources I can watch, learn, and do myself to get a jump start? My job has plenty of downtime and I want to fill that time to learn more things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the new network engineer for a certain company, I have inherited some...less than stellar network design choices. Regarding TACACS, I have had to make due with what's available until new equipment arrives. In the interim, I am trying to do some AAA implementation and getting hung up on a specific set of commands I'd like to restrict if possible.
 I am trying to restrict the Tier 1 techs in a way that allows them to manipulate a VLAN's tagged/untagged ports, but there are other commands under "vlan" I'd like for them to not be able to access. So, to add a port to, say VLAN 10, as untagged it would look like this:
 switch(config)# vlan 10 untagged ethernet 16 
 The problem is, it seems that I can only either allow no access to the "vlan" command tree or allow all. I say that because I do not know and have not been able to find a way to tell TACACS to allow the user access to the list of VLANs (since they are user defined) or the port number. I've tried using an asterisk after the "vlan" entry like so:
 vlan * untagged ethernet * 
 And other variations of this, but nothing has seemed to work. If anyone has any advice I'd greatly appreciate it, I would prefer not to have to give them access to the whole "vlan" command tree.

Zone A will house ICS, Zone B will house servers and Zone C will house users. Currently I have 2 domain controllers that mirror each other on the flat network. A handful of users will need to authenticate across all 3 zones.
 What should I do with the domain controller to keep it secure. Should I keep it in the user zone and place read-only DCs in the other zones? Should I keep it the servers zone and setup DCs in the 2 other zones with one-way trusts? Should I setup stand alone DCs in all 3 zones and create those user accounts accounts the 3 DCs? My paranoia is that if my one DC gets compromised then users can't log into the 3 zones. My ICS zone needs to be the most secure.

 i work in IT support of a Company with around 4500 employees - the default Smartphones we hand out are Samsung A53s 5G.
 So recently an employee left the company and we got a like-new A53 with Android 13 back to hand out to the next user.
 He did a factory reset but didnt remove his google account - so we cant access the device. Even a factory reset via recovery mode doesnt help. The phone always ask's for the last registered google acc.
 Does anyone of you have an idea how to bypass Samsung's FRP? I would prefer solutions without sussy external software.
 I saw some youtube videos how a guy accessed bixby with talkback (Android 12). Via bixby you can access some stuff like browser or settings... but it seems like this has been fixed with Android 13 - i at least could not make it work.
 Thanks for your ideas/solutions!

I am also concerned because from an compliance standpoint, Zabbix is internationally headquartered. As an ISP, is it safe/reasonable to implement a foreign, open-source network management tool?
 On that note, does anyone have any experience with a tool that would allow for automation, security monitoring, and data logging for an ISP network? As we may move away from Calix equipment in the future, interoperability and accessibility are important.

Anyhow, a large corporation recently acquired about 5/8 of these software products and all of the employees working with these software products have all had to join this corporation. The rest of the company stayed behind. One of these individuals who worked for the part of the company that got acquired was our sysadmin. He had been the system admin for several years and by the looks of it, documented nothing. There are no procedures, processes or anything anywhere. Nothing. The server room is a disaster, no cable management, a ball of cables the size of a small vehicle in the middle of the room and a huge disintegrating b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, we have a relatively complicated network setup that I have tried draw below to help explain. Currently we have two campuses linked together by a Siklu Etherhaul Wireless device (spec'd at 1gbps but really we get around 600mbps). We are a few days away from commissioning a new leased fibre circuit(using Openreach here in the UK) at 1gbps. We use this kind of site to site link in several location and we will be getting the full 1gbps throughput. I want to be in a position where by default, the switches will use the more reliable and higher bandwidth fibre link, not the WiFi.
 My concern is that by default, spanning tree will look at the two options for routing the traffic, see that they are both technically advertised as 1000mbps and just decide to use the WiFi.
 Can anyone advise how I can forcefully set the fibre link as the default in SPT?

From November 2022 through early January 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and authoring organizations identified the presence of indicators of compromise (IOCs) at a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency. Analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors, including an APT actor, were able to exploit a .NET deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in Progress Telerik user interface (UI) for ASP.NET AJAX, located in the agency’s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for remote code execution. According to Progress Software, Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX builds before R1 2020 (2020.1.114) are vulnerable to this exploit.[1]

 2 firewalls, yes I know. One is for a 2nd company that needs traffic as separate as possible from the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a question on how acceptable this is. I have a property where all of the inner vlan routing is done at the firewall level, the level of communication between vlans is relatively small and it has never been an issue.
 ​
 We recently installed a new security camera system and I am looking to relieve the new traffic now moving through the firewall from the camera to employee VLANs. My initial thoughts were to add IPs and a static route on our L3 core switch (that we currently do not use for any routing) and change the gateway for the camera vlan to point to the switch. I would keep the gateway of the employee vlan to the firewall, but the L3 switch would also be in the subnet sending the video feeds from the camera vlan, I was also planning on setting up the switch ACLs so just the camera ports are allowed through the switch.
 ​
 Does that sound reasonable? I could also change the DHCP scope for the employee vlan to the core and set the default route to the firewall on the switch, but the traffic to the camera vlan from employee is pretty minimal.

I've been learning from the official Cisco courses for the ENCOR and ENARSI exam (from cisco learning networks store), but unfortunately there is no single course there, that would prepare me for the CCIE EI lab. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations on what course/courses to take over the next few months/years to prepare for the lab?
 I'm thinking about starting the official course for the ENSDWI. That would probably prepare me for the SD-WAN part, because although I have some experience with it, but to learn how to set it up from 0 it totally different from just operating it and making some changes to it.
 Unfortunately at my company we don't have any clients, that would use Cisco SD Access, so I'm also looking for a place, where I can at least do some labs with the Cisco DNA Center. Also a bit more some BGP and MPLS practice wouldn't hurt, but I think that can be simulated by GNS3 or some other network sim.
 Do you have any preffered courses? What did help you to earn CCIE (or how are you preparing for CCIE)?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So - I was recently voluntold to help get a new network implemented for a nonprofit I help out at. Sure! I forgot how much i forgot however, it’s been a hot minute. Hoping you all can help get me on the right path.
 Setup: all 1G managed switches, Some connected by copper some by fiber/SFPs. Low low client count (under 100). There’s also a cable company provided gateway/router which spits out 192.168.0.x DHCP addresses internally. They also pay for two static IPs 10.x.x.x that currently go to some standalone ubiquiti server that routes them and handles the wifi internet access point traffic currently. The idea is to retire all that soonish. Keep if we must.
 All i wanted to do was set up this new network of switches i mentioned above on its own subnet (192.168.2.x) and everything on that subnet would be static IPs - and connect it at one place on ine switch with (i had assumed) A static route so anything not .2.x would get pushed to the cable company gateway/router and to the outside world. The .2.x subnet is for a POE camera system for them so thats why i was thinking keep it separate.. flawed? There’s also wifi 6 access points they want to add later for internet connectivity, and retire the old ubiquiti setup.
 Is this the right idea? Or should i swap over everything to be on the .0.x subnet? Should i leave everything on DHCP?
 Thanks..

 Any recommendations for the best alternative? Again, I don't need any hosting/email/marketing/junk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We have some issues with the networking thought you may have the same experience or you could help.
 We are running QEMU/KVM on Dual Epyc servers (256 logical core) with Mellanox dual 40G connections. When our customers were pushing more than 50k pps and a few hundred mbps starts to drop the VM's packets. However, the server load and the network load are very low almost nothing.
 We were start tune the network and the Kernel of the host as AMD/Intel recommended to see how it goes. Started using Vhost and multi-queues but now we are seeing a heavy load on the CPU from the Vhost/network which is higher than 70% of the CPU time with only a small number of VM's on these servers. Around 60VM's with low usage on CPU and 500Mbit (110k pps) on the network. The two Epyc 7h12 with 256 logical cores are pushing around 80 percent of the CPU and more than 60 percent of it is from the network/vhost. Now we don't have packet drops but under a heavy CPU load.
 Here are the configurations and changes we made.
 We have started with this 3 months ago
 -netdev tap,id=nic0,ifname=$TAPIF,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on,queues=8 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=nic0,mq=on,vectors=10,mac=$MAC 
 Still had packet loss.
 Latest config. High CPU load but no packet drops.
 -netdev tap,id=nic0,ifname=$TAPIF,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on,queues=2,poll-us=50000 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=nic0,mq=on,vectors=10,rx_queue_size=1024,tx_queue_size=1024,packed=on,mac=$MAC 
 This is how we create a network interface
 ip tuntap add $TAPIF mode tap user $َUSERNAME multi_queue
 Any idea?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a few Windows Server VMs on-prem. All of them except for our DNS/DHCP server are not super critical. Even if our DNS/DHCP server was compromised or died, we have a back up of the configs that we could just throw on a new Windows server instance. Most other VMs mainly just serve as app servers for facilities, or jump boxes for ScreenConnect. We run Veeam backups, but they're not being off-sited. They could go down and people could still do their jobs, but we'd still have to rebuild things for them.
 If we were ever compromised, the org would not really be heavily affected, but we'd probably spend quite a bit of time setting new things back up. My question, is should we invest the money and time into making sure we have off-site backups if the information is not super critical? Or are things more critical than I really think?

In most all cases, we put a media converter on the home end and connect an ethernet cable to their router. But rarely I will need to connect to an sfp port on a router. What are the requirements for the tranceivers? I need a downstream on the switch end and upstream on the router end? Do the brands need to be the same? Do bi-directional transceivers work on either end? Please forgive my ignorance on any terms I'm using here. Advice appreciated.

 Another long time lurker, fist time poster. Sorry for languange (not my first language) and if i missed community.
 So, my company is IT company, dealing primary in software developement. We are part of companys that are privaty held by one person. No compay helds share of other company, one person is phisical owner of all companys. Also owners wish is that our compay deals with all IT related problem.
 So the problem is, that people from this companys are freaquenty working in some other company ( in this group of companys) and bringing their PC's around, making a mess with licence tracking. It is not realistic, that when a person is tasked to work at other company for a period of time, his PC will be sold to this company and then (after he is finished) soled back to primary company again.
 So our idea is, that my company (IT) would own all the PC's and server, and leasing it to other companys. We can easly track where some PC is (majoraty of month), and invoiced the proper compay for monthy usage of this PC. But i cannot get the information if this kind of bussines model is legal from Microsoft Windows OS stand point? We would like to do the same with servers (Win Srv 2019 Datacenter for hosts and Standard for WMs).
 Can we buy PCs and laptops with OEM Win PRO licence and lease them to other companys?
 Thank you for pointing me in right direction, i will gladly provide additional information. And off course leagal and financial teams will be involved before pulling the trigger on the decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm looking for a recommendation for a product that folks have used and are happy with. I think ultimately we'd like a single product for endpoint security, but that may not be possible. 
 The most pressing issue is endpoint content filtering and https decryption. We need to be able to control URLs per-user or per-user group, and when we enable certain URLs (office365 for example) we need to re-write http headers to allow login only to certain tenants (similar to this KB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/tenant-restrictions ) However, we're going to want to control this for more and more cloud providers (adobe cloud, google workspaces, aws, etc) and each has a slightly different way they want the http header re-written to be able to lock down which users can login. 
 The above is my most pressing need right now, and cisco umbrella can do this when using the more advanced flavors of the product and the cisco AnyConnect agent on the endpoint, however it's limited to like 6 cloud providers at the moment, and not flexible. 
 So please let me know if you have a product you are happy with that can do the above. Now ideally this product would also replace our AV/Firewall/EDR as well, but that's sort of a secondary goal. 
 Thanks in advance

 She already has full access to the rooms and can delete the bookings just fine.
 But she can't adjust the times. They are greyed out in the scheduling assistant. She also can't invite other persons.
 As far as i know they were able to do that in Exchange on Prem. At least they told me that they were.

 Apart from that, A sound box with REST API support or NETCONF support, could give the network operator what RMON provides, right?

 - Not all data has the same criticality and many of them files are GigaBite sized could points or HD video. Loads of photos too

Also I only control the UK side. My boss was asking me should we still be using skykick. I have no control over this application at all and tbh have no idea what it does or what it's for. Could someone give me a quick rundown on what it is and if it's something you think we should still be paying for. Thanks

 I have been working as an IT-apprentice now for 1.5 years (my first job in IT ever). I have mostly done first line support for the company, this including installing new PCs, setting up new users, printers, phones, meeting rooms etc.
 In about a month there will be a subject test for me to get a certificate of apprenticeship.
 I just recieved what the last two apprentices had to do and I have no idea how to do this stuff as I have not done this type of stuff before, ever.
 In short what I have to do:
 "Set up a new IT-system for a school/business."
 - Three servers: two Domain Controllers and one Fileserver
 - Install two clients with windows and configurating them
 - IP range/segment (?)
 - Set up and configurate: AD, DNS, DHCP, Print and Document Services, Shares, Public and personal space.
 - Set up GPO for public and private
 - I also need to set up a switch, wich the two clients and printer will be connected to.
 The servers will be virtual (VMware)
 I have googled, but not sure what Im looking for.
 Im not asking for a full guide, but rather a nodge in the right direction. 
 This test will be over five days, I will also need to plan, document and evaluate my own work before presenting it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 I'm setting up some systems for the first time so I wanted to check best practices and security before implementation. I'm working for a SMB, the time has come to replace our old fileserver which contains over 20TB of files over the past several years. Currently, this file server's a windows server with multiple SMB shares on for pretty much all work across the business. 
 ​
 A new Dell ME5 Powervault has been set up running RAID10 with a single large LUN & volume. I have several queries on the best practice and configuration having only really worked with small setups single hosts, local storage etc. I'd like to ensure this is done properly.
 ​
 1) Should I just attach the Powervault on iSCSI using windows iSCSI Connect on a VM, then place the NTFS files direct on here? Or would a large VHDX be better for any reason e.g. performance, security, backup then mount this to Hyper-V? Or even multiple smaller VHDX's due to the size? 
 2) Security wise without too much impact on performance what is best e.g. CHAPS, Full disk encryption on the PowerVault, separate VLAN between the Powervault and Hypervisor? This would be done using a core switch, I don't have separate hardware I could use for isolation. 
 3) Is robocopy still the best method using MIR or /XO and ran before and after cut-off of the old server shares?
 4) Any other advise on best practices and security?

 I want that domain users can restart a specific service. I was able to set the permission with sc.exe.
 So far so good. But with this settings the user is also able to just stop the service, what I dont want. So I want to deploy a cmd script, instead of advising the users to do something in services. So the users can just double click the cmd script and the service will restart.
 Even though I granted the access for the user to restart the service (it works in services), the access with cmd (net stop && net start) is not granted. Is there a possibility?
 Best regards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 Having an odd issue, we have half a dozen staff using Macs for creative work and over 40 staff on windows devices. The windows devices have 0 issues with the SMB V3 share. Our macs also seem to work fine, i'm able to download and upload large files fairly quickly no issue.
 The problem we're having is InDesign saving to our servers SMB share. A 15MB InDesign file with a few images linked takes 40 seconds to save both when opened from the server and saved back or worked from a local source and saved to the server. I can copy a few GB from the same device to the server in less time with finder. If saved locally InDesign saves instantly. If copied and pasted from the macs local drive to the server it's also instant. InDesign feels like it just spins for 35s before trying to create a file.
 Has anyone else experienced this? We're using InDesign 18.1 on a 2017 iMac running Monterey 12.3.1 and a 2020 iMac also running the same OS and InDesign version. I've tried earlier versions back to 17.0 with the same issue still occurring.

In each company I've worked for, I've faced the challenge of managing tedious requests from developers, like restoring databases after they've broken them or granting access to databases for investigating bugs, creating new repositories, adding users to it, service restarts, redeployment requests etc...
 Sometimes, it can be overwhelming and tiring to manage these tasks. I'm curious to know if other DevOps/system engineers feel the same way. Do you also find this part of your job to be frustrating and tedious, that you try to avoid it and start procrastinating?

 Can I use CLAMAV to live scan the shared folder?
 The VM with Ubuntu, would only be used to create that share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 I am going to struggle to articulate what I'm looking to achieve here because I'm not sure how I go about this. 
 We currently have a suite of software delivered by a third party application - kind of like adobe creative cloud but for engineering.
 Now we had a policy change that means we no longer allow any user to be a local admin group member on any client endpoint. We instead use LAPS for the odd occasion when admin right sis needed.
 Before this policy change, the software suite was run via a service whose user was in every local admin group on all user endpoints, so this service no longer works and we're struggling to use other methods such as intune due to the size of the applications etc.
 So I guess what my question is, how do I make a service have the ability to run things as an administrator in the users login? 
 The applications we install are all based on a network share and currently I run the application as the local (LAPS) administrator and then pass user credentials to access the share. Very clumsy. The alternative I have setup for now is a script that deploys via intune its mounts a drive as system using hardcoded user credentials in the script to mount the share as a drive then manually running a shortcut for the executable (this is hit and miss). 
 My assumption is to run the service as system, but I don't think that this would be able to access network shares and also be able to interact with the user session for the install.
 Apologies if this is not very clear.

The place giving the course has a contractual obligation for placing you in some workplace after you pass. So I have a couple of questions:
  
What are the different job descriptions/options, what's the difference day-to-day, and can you rank how shitty or not they are in terms of work-life balance and general vibes / the wanting-to-roblox-scale?

 I just connected new domain controller DC2 (2022 server), the dhcp service has been left on the DC1 (2012 r2) server, The problem is that no dynamic client updates appear in the dns of the DC2 server. When I run dcdiag there are no errors. Is it normal behavior that dynamic client updates appear only on this server where DHCP service is running, or should it be synchronized to all DC/DNS servers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got a non-standard request that I haven't encountered before.
 A client has a company-issued laptop that will be used by remote/outsourced staff based overseas and as consequence of that, they'd like this laptop to be prevented from joining public WiFi networks but to still be able to join any WiFi networks that are considered either home or corporate networks.
 This a Windows 10 laptop joined to an Azure AD domain.
 I'm unsure of any built-in method in Windows that can achieve this and the client's current AV solution also doesn't have this functionality built into it (Webroot Endpoint).
 I know you can block a Windows device from joining specific SSIDs but Windows only determines a network is public/private/domain AFTER joining it via NLA, so on a technical level I don't see how the OS would know that particular network is "public" before being joined to it and therefore know that it's not allowed to join it?
 Is this something that you'd only be able to implement via 3rd-party software?
 Are there any Azure AD-based security policies that could achieve this?

I’d like to load the data to a database first and then connect to PowerBI via SQL to improve performance.
 My background is more in visualization so I have not had to set up a database before. Are there any recommendations on databases that take into account learning curve for a newbie? There may be some data transformation involved as well but that can be done in PowerBI.
 I was thinking of SQL Server but wanted to get some opinions. Thanks!!

 What are some of the most useful "canned" or custom queries / search functions you've utilized, that you couldn't do without? 
 As an example, in Tanium for instance it might be useful to get all workstations that need a reboot. For this, the query would be: 
 "Get Reboot Required from all machines" 
 What are some examples of some "go to" scripts, queries etc that you use frequently?

 We've tried several resolutions including adjusting to classic theme, remote FX, RDP bitmap settings etc, without a resolution.
 The focus issue appears to be specifically related to the version of mstsc on the local computer as the focus issue occur on older versions on Windows.
 Just wondering if anyone else has had issues and found a fix?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Past: I am a nearly 25yr system engineer that has mainly focused on VMware, storage, systems management and motioning. Starting as helpdesk in the late 90s and working up to infrastructure ops team manager, then back to contribute after a re-org. 
 Current: SysOps focused on infrastructure - compute and storage. About 70% on-prem/30% AWS.
 Future: Moving some of the environment to GCP, signing on with Snowflake for our data and reporting source. Manager has mentioned over the next few years our roles (2 Sr engineers incl me, 1 Jr engineer) will be migrating to more of a data engineering role. 
 My question for the hive: Where do I start my knowledge migration? I'm heavily involved in the Snowflake build and rollout. Should I start to focus on SQL, Python? Look into PowerBI and Looker (GCP)? I'm not feeling overwhelmed yet, but feel if I wait too much longer to get new knowledge learned, I'll start falling behind. I'd like to stay on top of it all as much as I can.

 Then I went back to college, dropped that shitty job, got an internship at $30/hr; got 4 IT certifications, working on cool tech I never thought I would touch in a million years. Life's pretty good, and have been at my current employer since.
 However, these recruiters at TEKsystems will not leave me alone. They keep calling me at odd hours of the day asking me if I want to work for pennies, they keep sending me emails for job listings that are asking for the whole IT department in one person. No matter how much I tell them I make, a new recruiter comes by every week or two and does the same thing. It's like a bad ex that won't leave me alone.
 My advice to the new people trying to break into IT reading this is to never touch TEKsystems, and to never give them your information. There has to be a mom & pop shop near you that'll be much better to work for, these parasites will just keep calling you no matter what. Learn from my mistake.

It always clears up after a few minutes.
 We have a dozen servers with exactly the same software and only one is doing this; vMotion to another host doesn't affect it. Nothing in the event logs leading up to it (other than AG disconnect notice during it) that's unique. Persists after reboot. No indication in metrics of high CPU or RAM usage or high disk latency or queue length or anything leading up to the event.
 Did something in last month's Windows Update really FUBAR it? Any idea what to look at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi we are looking at building a low latency MPLS/WAN deployment. We currently use SDWAN this is great but it runs over the internet. We currently see 15-20ms between sites. We have 2 x RO 5Gb on 10Gb connections at 4 key sites. One issue with this design is the latency is too high for our old applications. The other issue is the MTU is around 1300 usable with the SDWAN headers. 
 What I’m looking for is to put point to point connections between each of the sites. We already have 2 links between 2 of the sites that are 10Gb OSA giving us sub 1ms latency between these sites. This means I need 3 more point to point connections and 2 routers for each site. 
 Total 5 OSA links. 2 already in place. 8 routers with at least 4 x 10Gb connections on each. 
 Any advice or thoughts would be great. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im designing a huge building with upwards 3000 switches on the Access layer. The distance between the access layer and thr core switches exceeds the limitation of Multimode optics (upwards of 1km). To minimize the cost of Single mode transceivers i have decided to add a distribution layer in the middle. This, in addtion to now enabling MM optics , enables better segregation of the network as I can bring L3 closer to the access layer.
 Client however does not like the distribution layer i the middle and whats to go Sm between Access and core.
 Still trying to convince the client that the 3 tier topology is best. Are there other advantages than the ones ive mentioned?
 P.S the core switches are big enough to handle either topology.

 I could probably see a spinoff of this sub, turning into a weekly sysadmin recap podcast, but until then (if it ever happens) I'm curious if anyone has some recommendations for industry relevant podcasts, blogs or the like. Recently started listening to "Grumpy Old Geeks" and I periodically check out BleepingComputer amongst a few others, and looking for other places to check out.

I thought about sniffing traffic and the MTU should be the largest fragmented packet, but this feels too complex and might be wrong for some of the interfaces. Is there a MTU negotiation protocol so I can find it easily? Or any other easy way for determining MTU only by sending/ receiving packets? Thanks in advanced!

 I have a few questions about the Mikrotik CCR2004-16G-2S+. I would like to run the router in a data center and was wondering, if it supports LACP and having multiple ports for just a single network? Also, is it suitable for Mass-IP-Whitelisting? I'm planning to give it instructions on what IP addresses to allow via API.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 2 switch stack of 5120's. I no longer have enough ports in use to retain both in the stack and want to remove one. (Also, that switch has a fan failure). The switch I want to remove contains the SFP. I did some reading and am still a little fuzzy on what is going to happen. I have a spare sfp to move into the switch I plan to keep. My thoughts are:
 Backup Config
 Power down switch, install new sfp, configure vlans.
 Backup config
 Power back down and remove the stacking cable.
 Look in irf and look for "missing" switch and remove.
 Does this sound correct? Will the remaining switch automatically retain the config along with the ip address that is already assigned?
 Anything else I am missing or not thinking of?
 Thanks for any advice/assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the moment we are looking for an improvement in our data centers. We have two separated DCs that have redundant layer 2 dark fiber connections (not in use). In both datacenters are collapsed core topologies which are then connected to the campus core. The datacenter Vlans are routed from the respective collapsed core, i.e. the SVIs are located on the core VPC pair. The VPC peers share the gateway IP using HSRP.
 Since we want to connect both datacenters with layer 2 and the vlans should be available in both datacenters to move VMs back and forth comfortably, the question is how to solve this in the smartest way. My extensive internet research, unfortunately, has not brought a perfect solution. In addition, the documentation is often outdated (OTV/DCI etc.).
 One often mentioned possibility is to have 2 gateways in the DCs with two HSRP groups, but this does not seem to be a suitable solution. I was thinking of pulling another layer into the topology, so that the collapsed core layer becomes the aggregation layer. Above then comes a real core layer with all SVIs and again HSRP gateway. One VPC peer of the core layer would then be in the first DC and the other VPC peer in the second DC.
 Does anyone have an idea or a suggestion or is there no getting around VXLAN for such concepts nowadays ?

 See below link to image of the network topology, the test scenarios and utilisation results.

 I’ve noticed an issue when testing the 1G interfaces of ROUTER-01 via the SWITCHES. I’m only seeing 76% utilisation when I expected closer to 100%. On further diagnosis using our testers, I am only passing 10% though the ROUTER-01 1G interfaces and then only 10% from SWITCH-01 via the interface ROUTER-01 connects to.
 I feel it may be related to the QoS config limiting the traffic (particularly the traffic testing at 10%…]]></summary>

 Is it possible for these two pieces of equipment to actually communicate with each other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,recently I have received a remark from the security team about short SSH host key on one of our servers. It`s 1024 bit, and as far as I know today`s standard is 2048 at least, even if 1024 bit length key is not broken yet.I`m just wondering what is a real attack scenario based on short ssh-rsa host key? Supposing (hypothetically ) the adversaries derived private key from public, what are those keys used for? What the attacker can do with that? I understand that host key pair is used for a host authentication, but is that all? Does it take part in key exchange procedure?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never used Terraform and Kubernetes and the project hasn't started yet, so if you think I should switch technologies feel free to let me know. I usually use Docker and Puppet.
 ​
 Suppose I have 3 dedicated servers and a VPS
 ​
  
A Dedicated server running Postgres on Kubernetes
 A Dedicated server running a Go server on Kubernetes
 A Dedicated server running Python sever on Kubernetes
 The VPS is used to monitor those servers and for admin tasks
  
​
 I have the following questions:
 ​
  
Let's say that the Postgres server is running low on resources, does Kubernetes notify me to buy a new server? 
 
If I need to set alarms manually to buy a new server, then what are the best practices? How do you decide when it's time to buy a new server? 
 
Can I buy a new server and not add it to any cluster and let Kubernetes decide if it wants to add it to any of the clusters mentioned above? Can I have servers on standby and then Kubernetes either use it for Postgres or Go etc?
 
How to protect against DDOS? Do I run all the clusters behind Cloudflare Or Do I buy additional firewall servers and run the clusters behind the firewall? Is it easy to set up Cloudflare?
 
 ​
 So essentially, we're starting a new project, and we'll need at least 3 servers and a VPS as mentioned above, the project might scale up and if it does, I want to have answers to those questions so I know how to act.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All I hear is my manager slating someone who said something to him once, therefore we don’t help them. Or we put roadblocks in place so they can’t have what they request, using the excuse of GDPR or PCI. I won’t go into specifics but it’s pretty clear he’s lying, sometimes it’s just unrelated entirely but users buy into it because he bombards them with buzzwords and tech language. Overhearing it gives me second hand embarrassment. Someone complained once about wanting a different ISP because the last one let us down at a major event (this is true), all of a sudden my manager fucking hates him and refuses to assist him. Ever. 
 We also only choose suppliers that are his friends. The companies we choose get paid double what anyone else would charge, some work we could actually do in house as certain team members are actually certified in that area, but we choose to go with some random external contractors who charges insane amounts. 
 I don’t know how he’s getting away with it. Nobody dare question him because he confuses them with jargon and gets majorly defensive. 
 It’s making the job really rubbish, it feels like one vicious circle. User requests support with purchasing new software > user complained about IT once > we refuse to assist them > user buys new system themselves anyway > system gets implement with no support from us, constant roadblocks, dragging our heels > poor end users get issues and ring for help, we refuse. It’s so fucking awkward as the person answering the phone to deny them assistance.
 I do this job to earn money, I know it’s not personal, but honestly it makes me sad how far behind we are with technology and not giving end users a solution that would really improve their work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow sysadmins, seeking your advice on how to address a recent phishing email incident in our organization. The email successfully bypassed our existing security measures and landed in one of our executive's inbox. The concerning part is that the email display name was cleverly spoofed to appear as our internal HR department, despite coming from an external email address r12fdf@icloud.com.
  
 I'm wondering if adding our HR department email group (hr@mycompany.com) and other similar department email groups as a "user" to be protected from impersonation in Microsoft Defender anti-phishing policy would prevent similar spoofed display emails from reaching any of our user's inboxes.
  
 I would appreciate any suggestions, insights, or alternative solutions that you might have in this regard. Thank you for your help in advance! On M365 Exchange Online and Microsoft Defender.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am preparing to install some nexus 9ks to replace our old nexus hardware. While I don't plan on making many changes during the upgrade process I am trying to get a feel for what I could be with them. So far I have been looking into potentially moving toward VXLAN and possibly leveraging guestshell to do occasional validation testing of network throughput using iperf or something. Not sure what I could use as a client to test against a 100gb network, but the switches are very oversized currently.
 However I know there is a lot more I could look into. Even if I don't use it I enjoy learning interesting things and what I learn today will likely get used when the next absurd network requirement is asked. This is my first time having the opportunity to plot the future of a smaller datacenter and I don't want the network to ever be the reason why something can't be done (hence the current plans for VXLAN).
 Thanks in advance for any suggestions or avenues of research!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was just wondering, if one wants a hardware token, why one should buy a yubikey ? Linux seems to accept any USB stick as a hardware token, as long as it's initially configured by the pam library. Alternatives such as nitro/solo/only key exist, and known brands such as kingston and verbatim have models on which Fido protocol is implemented.
 So what would be the point of getting a pricy yubikey ? Because yubico partners with big services providers ? Is a "pam homecooked" hardware token not crossplatform ? not accepted by these service providers ? Is yubikey the answer only because it embed additional NFC hardware/feature ?
 I'd appreciate any teaching from you guys

 Simple networking question
 Hey, all. I’d consider myself to have intermediate network knowledge and I need some advice. …
 Currently I purchase 2 static IPs from my business internet provider. I use one for my public router, the other is for the company’s Fortigate which tunnels to corporate. The setup has worked well, but I’m slightly limited. 
 Since I’ve converted to VoIP, our non business class routers don’t do a good job handling traffic for 10 phones, even with QoS on and SIP disabled. 
 Currently, I’ve migrated the phones to behind the WAN. The Fortigate handles them much better, but I’m limited. There are blocked ports, some of which affect phone provisioning. The Fortigate is corporately controlled. I’m able to access the UI, but it’s connected to FortiManager for its config. Making any changes that large would throw a big red flag. 
 Should I keep the two statics, or should I save money and migrate to a single DHCP? If so, what can I put behind the modem to manage traffic (on the cheap!). Can I provision a managed switch to handle the ISP, QoS for the phones, and separate the traffic for the Fortigate? Do I have to buy something expensive like a Ubiquiti VLAN capable device? I’m open to any ideas.

 So one of my other challenges is hardware vendors switching to subscription support models and software vendors ditching prpertual licensing for that sweet...sweet stock inflating continuous revenue stream (I'm looking at you Citirx and VMware!)
 We're currently looking into upgrading our current Exchange 2013 environment (yes...I know its EOL beginning of April...grrrrr) and were looking into on-prem for depreciation and CAPex, but that was deemed too expensive so the upper's considered O365 because it was a less expensive hit this year as OPex.
 Now, the C-suite is involved and I can't do anything while it is discussed further. Discussions have been going on for over a year and a half and I am still at square one when either way, I could have been done already.
 I mean...it's not like Email is a lifeblood of a business or anything /s
 My question...is it possible to depreciate expenses like O365 and subscription VMware/Citrix licensing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Luckily for me, I am a part of a company that decided to cheap out on their VoIP implementation, meaning we are using a system that is horribly outdated. We are using a "Zulty's" system that has a phone app you can download, but half the time it doesn't seem to work.
 For example, if you receive a phone call, answer it, then end the call, you have to be sure you re-open the app, or else you will be stuck on "On the phone" status, meaning any additional phone calls will not ring to the app until you open the app again.
 So, my question is, has anyone ever had to deal with a situation where you need to route it through something else? Even if it is to route it through something like Google Voice, etc. we are dealing with a call group (our helpdesk line) that is hit or miss if the person on-call is receiving the phone call, because the app is terrible.
 My experience with VoIP is limited as you may be able to tell, but any suggestions are great. We can't move to another system with just that number / phone group as it's a part of a contract, however just being able to get a phone call through something whether it's through another app that is better would make our lives so much easier.
 Thanks if you have any ideas!

 Debloating

I am considering decommissioning the server and moving to Exchange Online only. I wanted to share my thoughts and get some feedback on whether this is possible or the correct way to go about things.
 First, let me explain a bit about my current setup. Our organization has been using Exchange Server 2016 for several years now, and we implemented a hybrid deployment with Office Online. This allows us to have the benefits of both on-premises and cloud-based Exchange, including password and directory synchronization. 
 However, as we continue to evaluate our IT infrastructure, we are considering moving to Exchange Online only. There are several reasons for this, including cost savings, security, and reliability.
 So, is it possible to decommission the Exchange Server 2016 and move to Exchange Online only? We want to keep our AD syncing with Azure and our passwords syncing. I read this article (below) that says we should keep an Exchange server online, but we are at the point where I'd either need to spin up some new VMs or go Exchange Online only.

Currently we run a SAML IDP with a custom authentication process that reads from multiple databases, no central user storage or management, authentication is a function of a matching email existing in certain locations and the values of various database columns.
 There is no single source of truth for user information. Would like to store users in one place along with roles/permissions management. We transmit some of these as SAML attributes currently, sending what is relevant to each service provider.
 Most of these users are low value, not paying customers or employees and the client deemed Okta too expensive, I don't think they'd go above $0.25 per user but they'll happily pay tens of thousands for us to set up something free.
 It's not exactly my wheelhouse and I'd be doing this entirely on my own with a restrictive timeline/budget so I need some advice. Would like to stick with SAML auth since I know it works on all things users need access to and I have a decent understanding of it at this point. Could Azure AD suit these needs? That's my 2nd choice after Okta but the presentation to me as a developer isn't as clear.
 I'm leaning towards a cloud product recommendation and help setting it up vs something we'll have to install, configure, host and maintain, because of the severely limited resources, but may have to go with something self-hosted due to budget constraints.

 This script first defines the name of the app to be blocked. It then gets the path to the startup folder for the current user's Terminal Service profile from the registry. If the startup folder exists, the script checks if the app is already there, and if so, it exits. If the app is not there, it creates a shortcut to the app and adds it to the startup folder. Finally, the script outputs a message indicating that the app has been blocked on startup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow admins! I'm experiencing the strangest issue with my Lenovo Slim 7 Carbon. Intermittant touchpad operation. It just seems to 'lose' my finger. I thought maybe it's dirty, or dirty fingers, but for some reason, I'll be moving my pointer and suddenly it stops. I then have to wait for it to decide to work again. No issue with using multi-fingers to scroll, zoom, etc. Just the single finger Has anyone else experienced this? As you can imagine, this has made remote access more challenging than usual when I can't use a mouse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so I've been in this space for a few years, and have worked with servers from HP, Dell, Cisco, even a smattering of supermicro and fujitsu. But we got about 40 servers from Lenovo about two years ago, and they have been nothing but a constant headache. Which fine, A bad firmware here, a faulty driver there, it has happened with all of them. The problem comes down to the support. 
 Their support has NO clue what they are doing, Every time we call in, we have to explain the situation to them multiple times, We demonstrate the problem to them, and they cannot comprehend what the issue is. Like they've never done break/fix before in their lives, and so troubleshooting steps are foreign to them. Their knee jerk reaction to any issue is a motherboard swap. We've had the motherboard on a system replaced 7 and 8 times without resolving the very obviously firmware issue. 
 The techs they send out are all contract, and other than replacing system boards have no knowledge or desire to do anything beyond swapping boards, there have been several times they have failed to update serial numbers and other things (I believe they have all been IBM techs). 
 The newest experience has me laughing, We opened a ticket for a power supply gone bad, and they somehow confused us with another company, and Now we're invited to a teams meeting monday for their issue. 
 Has anybody had a good experience with Lenovo support for servers? any tips? 
 When I did desktop support, I LOVED Lenovo thinkpad support, they had amazing support processes, and super knowledgeable people, fast response times, etc. It has been the exact opposite with the servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I launched a software licensing service not that long ago. As a Software Vendor (I made a desktop app that I was looking to to sell), I found existing Software Licensing solutions (FlexLM, Sentinel, Wibu, Nalpeiron) were either prohibitively expensive to adopt and difficult to use, or just didn't have sufficiently robust capability.
 I think looking at it from the software Vendor's perspective is only part of the problem, since many end users also complain about licensing (more so than the vendors!). Looking through other threads, some of the big issues that kept coming up seem to be:
 - Easier to "steal" rather than install and activate correctly
 - Difficult to get buy in from higher ups to switch to a software with easier to work with licensing policies. We're talking monolithic On-Prem License servers with UI from the 90s that have never been updated used to enforce concurrency.
 - There is no single agreed upon standard, every ISV might have their own definitions for floating licenses, a seat, or a user-based license provisioning. This inconsistency makes SAM automation a nightmare.
 - ISVs sometimes prefer to prevent piracy rather than deploy in an environment that they cannot control (in a VM, for example).
 - Hardware Dongles aren't going away.
 - Node Locking fails often for many reasons (MAC address isn't persistent; you attach a new dock and the device fingerprint changes etc.). 
 What else could be improved to make licensing software less of a headache for everyone? #opensource

 We are looking at deploying WPA3 on our APs for our AD managed devices.
 Currently have an 802.1x WPA2 GPO with computer cert based authentication setup.
 Issue running into is our DCs are still server 2016, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to setup WPA3 within the GPO settings. Server 2022 does have that option for WPA3, so would it be possible to just introduce a brand new 2022 VM into our DC environment to apply these settings? Planning on upgrading all DCs to 2022 by the end of this year, but just want to start testing WPA3 802.1x right now.
 Thanks!

I have an end user whose mapped drives are suppose to connect automatically at start up but they don't. The drives show up with red x's and only when you click them it turns green. From my understanding windows runs a script at start up when it is configured to connect mapped drives automatically. Is it possible that the windows script is timed to run before the stp forward delay timers reach zero and move the switch port into a forwarding state? If so, portfast is most likely disabled. Just looking for some insight before I decide to escalate this ticket.

 I work out in Hawaii, and we have 2 offices on 2 islands, served by 2 ISP's - Office_A is served by HawaiianTel on the island of Maui, and Office_B is served by Spectrum on the island of Oahu.
 Question: why do I get 2 different traceroute results from either location when running a simple traceroute between the 2 sites?
 From Office_A to Office_B, it's 14 hops, that actually runs from Maui -> Oahu -> California -> Oahu.
 However, from Office_B to Office_A, it's just 9 hops bouncing from router to router on Oahu before heading to Maui.
 Why wouldn't the traceroute results be more or less the same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've identified a situation where traffic from a cloud provider is slow from a specific ISP. After discussions with both the ISP and the cloud provider, they are essentially pointing fingers at each other. 
 Obviously traffic shaping from the ISP is a very possible scenario- but aside from that, there could be issues with the traffic between the ISP and the cloud provider server- right? Of the parties involved, who would be responsible for sorting that out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so hopefully someone can advise here.
 We have quite a complicated setup which I'll miss a lot of information out to keep this brief... we have an OSPF instance (OSPF 20) with our ISP. The ISP advertises several routes to us including a default route and a route to one of our remote branches among DCs.
 We also receive a route to our remote DC from another OSPF instance (OSPF 10) with our internal routers. This is redistributed into OSPF by the neighbor route as an E1 route.
 At present, the route to the remote DC that is making it into the routing table is the one from the ISP (OSPF 20), while we want the traffic to route internally via OSPF 10.
 I've tried a few ways to fix this but can't seem to crack it. I though using a route-map against a distribution list on the ISP OSPF instance to set the metric higher would work if I matched the route I was interested in, but it seems to filter out all routes from the ISP EXCEPT the one I want to affect.
 I feel like I'm missing something crazy obvious here, any chance one of you geniuses can help me out?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Networkers of reddit,
 This issue first came up with a client that couldn't process their CC transactions after coming back from lunch. Essentially they could not resolve xyz domain and further examination revealed other domains also not being able to be resolved but 95% of domains on the internet are being resolved.
 Ive pegged it down to the Fortigate(s) simply because if we Ethernet into the back of Comcast modem DNS resolves to these specific domains. Alright so then I remembered our own business uses Comcast business and also has a Fortigate 61E and I can reproduce the problem on our network. I even noticed now I cant even hit the slickdeals website to which I was just checking it out last week on my machine. OK so I if i know the IP and setup a forward zone on the DC to the IP for the domain it routes and comes up. If i setup my machines DNS to googles/openDNS/comcast DNS it still will not resolve. If i nslookup using another DNS server besides the domain controller it will not resolve. I feel this eliminates the windows DNS DC(s). Packet captures show the DNS requests going to the DC out so I dont understand why the requests are timing out. I can double check the WAN packet capture but why would it fwd DNS request for certain domains and not others?
 No changes have been made to the Fortigates OS 7.x on any of these separate sites and neither have any web filtering rules other than blocking foreign countries inbound. There are no external connector feeds to 2 of the sites and ive disabled them on our site. I can replicate this problem across 3 different places across the city the only correlation being they are all on comcast business using fortigates across multiple workstations. Software upgrades on the fortigates are manual so I can only think of something being bugged, exploited or i need other ideas. I hope ive explained enough to get some insight from you guys.

 We have a small network in one of our outlying buildings consisting of a Sophos Firewall, and an Aruba switch. There are 3 subnets, LAN, WiFi, and the VPN.
 Yesterday users on the Wifi and VPN subnets were unable to connect to the Server on the LAN subnet, and vice versa. Connections LAN to LAN work flawlessly. No configuration or hardware changes had been made. 
 We noticed after doing some discovery that when attempting to ping PCs on the LAN subnet from any other subnet the packets would timeout 92% of the time. There would be a long series of timeouts, then a brief period (about 30 seconds or so) of connection that would work fine, then the connection would start timing out again for about 8(ish) minut…]]></summary>

 Things like "Hey I tried calling but you weren't at your desk. I left a voicemail and this email is a follow up when can we meet to get thing done" only for a few days later I get a call from a supervisor on how I hadn't got thing done cause user never responded to me
 ​
 to multiple emails about people needing to set up their new account for something only to have someone furious at me that they where never made aware of new account and they don't have time to create a username and password.
 ​
 Even simple things like asking for clarification on a problem, then not hearing from a person till they walk by 3 days later and ask if i have a solution for their problem that I wasn't even sure what the issue was. 
 ​
 Even in the last staff meeting I mentioned I would distribute my quick presentation via email only to loudly hear an employee say "Well no one reads your emails anyway" 
 ​
 I have been looking for my out (though i know this problem is everywhere) but it seriously just makes me feel like i am losing my mind when things end up being My fault cause someone doesn't read their email.

I've searched for suggestions between Aruba and Juniper, but I'm running into a lot of trouble comparing their exact specs. The short of it is, I need a 1RU, 48GBE (SFP+ / multgig a bonus, but not priority), POE+(at least 10 ports), L3 managed(or "2+"), with dual redundant PSU (Field replaceable preferred, but not required). 
 The closest I can tell, I should be looking at the 3810M or EX4100 series, but would really appreciate any input. If anyone could point me to a matrix that actually compares multiple brands, I will send you a digital kiss as well!

Am I right about the placement of the firewall and the BGP router?
 If the firewall doubles as an IPS, does that change anything?
 Does this require 2 firewalls?

 Any advice? Thanks
 UPDATE: So far, the option of using TAP (suggested by u/zm1868179) seems to be the best option to try. So far, looks promising; although the TAP is supposed to stay active for 60 minutes, my outlook profile on iPhone is still active and still fetching mails. Not sure when the system will ask to log in again, but definitely not after 60 minutes. Will update the post.
 P.S. TAP is cumbersome as this has to be created by an admin, but it is kind of okay for a small company

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for patching tools that support schedules based on X days after Patch Tuesday such as AWS Maintenance Windows or Syxsense.
 Example: Test Environment A would patch 3 days after patch Tuesday. Prod Environment A would patch 12 days after patch Tuesday.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a decent patch tool for a multi-domain multi-site enterprise environment that supports this capability?
 Ideally the tool would be able to patch Windows and Linux OS environments as well as third party software (Acrobat Reader, Zip utilities, ect), but the biggest need at this point is Windows OS updates.

From what I gather, the mgmt console should be upgraded first and then the actual firewalls. Can I just call support during the upgrade in case it doesn't go smoothly or will i need pro services for something like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently transferred from one university division to another. In this new division I work in, they have never had an IT guy. Concepts like ticketing systems, remoting systems, and no access to admin for the average user is very foreign to them. I'm the single IT guy for about 300 users. This division has many departments.
 Active Directory was a mess. I've mostly straightened that out and reorganized OUs and such. They finally agreed to the purchase of a ticketing system. That got funded today....Really happy about that. I am sick of getting calls, emails, team messages, skype messages, texts, and office pop-ins. They are finally receptive to purchasing a remoting system. 
 But what really pushes my buttons are that the Leadership is stubborn on wanting all users to have administrative access to everything! I've showed them university SOPs. I've cited my state's government SOPs on admin credentials. I've told them I do not fill comfortable trading convenience for security. 
 My reasoning for posting this would be to ask for advice. Does anyone have any "scary" stories I can let my leadership read. I'm looking for cautionary tales that will scare them into submission! Also looking for advice on how to handle these asshats!

This is not a major installation, no raised floor CRAC or fancy fire suppression system. What might I incorporate into the design and layout to make things a bit more efficient and my life a little easier?
 Space is not finalized yet but it will be a minimum of 180 SF for four racks. Maybe a lot more. I will be installing ladder racks and Netfloor tiles. I will install new Ethernet throughout the office area too. It will have redundant cooling and a dedicated electrical subpanel.
 If enough space is available I plan to install a standing bench for equipment staging and diagnostic work.
 -edited to add, I did a very thorough cost analysis of moving to colo or public cloud, not going to happen-
 Thoughts?

 As an example the advanced threat hunting schema tables now include Device prefixed tables, and it has details on all devices and not just the ones licensed for P2.
 My intention is to keep most devices on Plan 1 while having a subset of devices on Plan 2. 
 Why is the portal letting me see details on all devices and not just the ones licensed for the higher tier? Is there some setting that can restrict this and filter out the noise down to P2 licensed devices only.

 I've been thinking/studying to take AZ-900 but what other Certifications would you recommend which would help me prove that i know what i say i know if you catch my drift.
 I would like to learn more about Security and Microsoft as well as Networking
 I did think about taking Security+ and CCNA but as i dont do any Networking in my job it's hard to learn it as i'm not working with it daily

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have a client that uses an email to send personal information and documents to their clients. They specified that the email has to be able to send encrypted messages and multiple users need to be able to read and reply back to emails from it. No problem! we can set it up as a shared mailbox, and enable encryption on it.
 However, a phone call with the user, she also now mentions that she also needs her front desk to be able to log into the account to send scanned documents from this email and not just a shared email. This makes it a little more complicated because you now have to have a license attached to it for it to be logged into. No worries though, we can do this we just enable MFA (Now that it's going to be physically able to be logged into), give read/send permissions to the needed users so they can access from their email, and enable Encryption on the email. All done!
 Third call with the user comes, she now mentions that the email will be used for SMTP from a 3rd party with their application that they use to send out contracts, documents, etc. This is where it gets complicated, I have no idea how to keep this email secure with MFA (As far as my understanding, SMTP will not work with MFA enabled), we now can't change the password, or it's going to break the application from sending emails, and now we have 4 different people inside of this email that has access to personal, sensitive information.
 So my question is, how would you go about it to make this account secure and meet the requirements. We can make another account if needed and makes sense to do so.
 Requirements
 1) Allow SMTP
 2) Possibly Disable Login, if not then enable MFA.
 3) Allow shared account access from multiple users.

 I'd like start hosting some cyber-security competitions for some kids. Something like these: https://www.bestcolleges.com/bootcamps/guides/top-cybersecurity-competitions/, but ones that I control to whip out and use outside of competition days.
 Essentially, the way I see it working is that I produce a linux VM, make some insecure changes (no updates, passwords changed to 1234, password requirements, chmod 777 some config files, random executable in home dir, no anti-virus, etc.) and then get the kids to find and fix those changes, and get scored on the number of fixes they do.
 I can do all this with scripts etc. to check various scenarios and build the images, but I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on where to start or if they have an idea of scoring or any issues that should be included.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regardless of which firewall we are using from one of the popular brands like Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, or Sophos Fortinet, PA, Cisco or Sophos, what is the best way to allow a user to establish SSL VPN from only a specific device?
 While researching, I found that many of the admins suggest using PKI certificate-based authentication. However, I am concerned about the downsides of using a cert-based VPN.
 Firstly, certificates have a limited lifespan, which means I will have to monitor the age of all issued certificates continually. 
 This could mean a lot of effort, especially if we have so many VPN users.
 Secondly, not all regular users are knowledgeable enough to install a certificate on their device, which would mean that I would have to bring the device in to have the certificate installed. This could be a repetitive process because the certificate has a definite lifespan.
 Given these concerns, I wanted to ask the community: what is the best way to restrict SSL VPN access to specific devices while avoiding the downsides of cert-based VPN? Are there any alternative methods or best practices that I should consider? 
 Any insights or recommendations would be appreciated.

 I use WSL2 Ubuntu distribution for my development stuff and sometimes i need to access my Windows's localhost from WSL. There is an IP in /ets/resolv.conf that can be used to access Windows but firewall blocks all requests from WSL by default, after some digging i could not find a way to fix it with firewall rules so i tried to disable firewall just for WSL's virtual network adapter and it worked.
 Here is powershell command, that i use: Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Public -DisabledInterfaceAliases "vEthernet (WSL)"
 I does the thing as i said but the problem is that every time i disable/enable firewall with it, firewall spits out permission prompts for every program that i already permitted before. Sometimes it is very annoying, especeially when permissions are reset for my DLNA and network sharing sevices and i can no longer access my PC via local network.
 Is there something that i'm doing wrong? Would appreciate any advice on how to configure firewall to allow outbound requests from WSL environment without having to explicitly set permissions for every program again every time.

 ​
 Various apps from Word, Outlook, Excel to OneDrive all repeatedly prompting to sign in with their M365 credentials over and over. 
 ​
 Not seeing any pattern to as it seems to be impacting all Windows clients from local AD joined, AD joined with AADconnect sync, AzureAD Joined, Windows Hello, Regular password, or even basic workgroup. All same problem all in the past two weeks all different M365 tenants.
 ​
 ​
 The workaround is to 
  
open Word and click File - Account - Sign out all accounts
 
Then log off, log back in as a different local admin account and delete the folder: C:\Users\<username of the user with the issue>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPluginxxxxx\
 
Then reboot and log back in to Windows profile and sign back into the apps again.
 
 ​
 But even with that some people get the problem again the following day.

 The customer I am helping right now has created some simple diagrams about memory, CPU etc for switches, some temperature sensors from the server room, and UPC battery levels as tracked in the software they use for monitoring. This is, however, some really old version of the software and the view with diagrams needs to be scrolled so no use in displaying them on the monitor screen. Also, they need something to show/display to the boss which is rather general, and colorful but 'not too alarming' (should not be screaming about some newly detected problem too early, more like day average situation overview).
 Any advice? What would you put on the 'boss dashboard' about your network? What type of view would you do just to help you/your colleagues do their job?

 I started an internship a few months ago and was tasked with setting up a HA cluster with a few test servers, after about 2 or 3 weeks I figured it out and got it set up. Keep in mind I am studying Computer Science, so my knowledge on networking and system administration is limited, honestly not sure why they gave me this work to do. 
 Now a few days ago they gave me access to a live server they want me to set up and I ran into an error I don't know how to fix. 
 I am using two Window server 2019 and running mssql 2019. I wanted to set up the failover cluster, but when running the validate configuration wizard, I get this error:
 DHCP status for network interface 'servername'.'domainname' - Ethernet0 differs from network Cluster Network 1.
 The servername and domainname is filled in, but I just left it blank for security reasons 
 I have tried googling the problem, but I'm not getting any luck there. Also no one in the office knows how to work with databases, and the one guy that does kinda know what is going on, is very busy with other stuff so I can't bother him too much.

 How often are you running those full backups and especially with workloads that are large but with a low change rate where you're just backing up the same TBs of data every time you take a full backup.
 I guess there's no right answer just trying to read the room on where it's headed.

 So far we've explored Bitwarden and 1Password, and I've also had a couple of brief flings with NordPass and Dashlane. None of them come up to feature parity with LastPass, but 1Password's security architecture was compelling.
 However, last week I came across Keeper, and it's the first product I've found that is enterprisey enough to have everything we're after, without being a full blown PAM/PAW solution like CyberArk. 
 The features we're after are:
  
Azure AD integration for login and user provisioning
 Custom templates for records
 Granular sharing
 Ease of use for 'normal' users
 Actually secure
  
Does anyone having any experience with Keeper to either say they'd recommend it, or recommend completely avoiding it?
 I've heard bad things about their Firefox plugin, but I will be doing a trial personally to validate that.
 Also, does anyone know of any in depth security assessments carried out by independent security experts that can validate that their security architecture is good?

 There is a shared mailbox used by the sales team. Periodically they'll get hit with waves of 50-100 per hour bounce-back notifications or "Mail Delivery Failure" messages. It's all mail servers responding with limited details, as in they don't include the original message, and from what I can tell the headers are not original so I can't glean much info.
 I'm still not 100% certain if this is originating with us. I'd like to confirm if someone has gained access to the outgoing SMTP and is sending from our mail server or if it's spoofed emails being bounced back to our spoofed email address.
 Does anyone have any helpful advice?
 The only useful info I've found so far on the backend is that "Real-Time Detections" show the incoming "Mail Delivery Failure" emails as quarantined malware emails. It lists us as the recipient and the mail servers as the senders.
 Where do I go from here?

 My job itself is very challenging and I get a lot of freedom in developing our infrastructure. The expertise in our team is skyhigh and I learn everyday. Every few months when I look back and I am amazed at how much I learned. I am allowed to make mistakes, no hard feelings. 
 Our team leads have vision for the future and know how to communicate this. As far as I can tell this vision is in line with the developments in our field.
 I get to be responsible for processes and I get to criticize policy and processes. If spearhead an effort to change something people listen with an open mind. Often people will think along with me and enable me to actually make a difference. 
 I work exclusively with Linux systems we fully administer ourselves. The only windows in my life is the labtop because thats policy. 
 The lunch at work is cheap and amazing in quality for what you pay. 
 Sure there are bad days and good days. The business is terrible at software development lifecycle. We get involved way too late. There are large problems with understaffing in our team. But in general the good far outweighs the bad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I am a storage/vmware admin at my current role and our network team is looking into moving away from our current network setup. We are currently using Xtreme switches and core and moving on the Fabric. 
 While my SAN switches are now not routed over the core and are different from my TOR switches. My 4 SAN switches are running standalone, 2 in each datacenter connected to each other. 
 Now with Fabric incomming our network team want to use the same switch for TOR and SAN network both routed over the core, is this a good idea ? 
 Currently i'm running a test cluster with a vmware host connected to 2 frabric switches for TOR & SAN and that traffic is running over our old core X8 back to our old SAN switch and our storage appliances. What I am seeing atm is there are only a few test VM's running on that host, but the latency is high. I wonder if this setup is a good idea or if it's better to keep SAN completaly seperated from the other traffic like it is in our current setup.

 The app essentially reads the settings from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App.
 Problem is that all computer accounts are in a single OU and it's beyond my decision & control to re-organize them in different OUs. And the requirement is the App needs to be configured based on user's role, so it needs to be User-specific settings. Computer is shared by multiple users shift work.
 What could be some creative ways to allow the app to be configurable via domain GPO and User-specific? Some ideas...
  
Insert them into HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App but the App would not read it there.
 PowerShell script on login to apply the settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App. But the settings also needs to be cleared on logoff so the next user's settings can be applied? Or maybe clearing the settings isn't necessary since the next user's settings will just get re-applied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a DevOps consultant since late 2021. So far it has been un-fulfilling. I basically did this because everyone on my team left my old job aside from a couple people, including my manager leaving and it was the only easy option to get off the sinking ship. I've been a Systems Engineer previously for about 10 or so years.
 I can either go back to my old job possibly but no one on my team is there aside from two people, or try to find a new job that is remote only. I've been fortunate that my last 2 jobs out of 3, I've put my heart in and have gotten promotions and been able to do things that helped the company. With my latest it's just not the same.
 Has anyone been in the same boat? There are some people that got me here at my current job and I feel like I might burn bridges but I want to have that fire back in. I just feel like I work best devoted my time to fix things at a company as opposed to coming in, doing a project and leaving. I hate the feeling of starting a project with a bunch of new people and rinsing and repeating with other new people. It causes so much anxiety for me. I prefer to go to midsize company and pave the road and make a name for myself (based on my previous jobs this has worked out...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This just came up while configuring a new NAC deployment.
 Fairly common scenario that I've not thought through before. You have your relay agents (whatever they are) configured with a pair of dhcp servers to cover your ass. When the relay agent receives a request, does it forward to both, round robin, or some sort of stateful decision tree? Just finished reading rfc 1542 (best, most detailed description I could find) and I'm no better informed on the topic.
 At this point, I'd love to throw together a lab and experimentally check what a dozen different devices do, but have a few too many projects I'm behind on. Anybody already done this legwork?
 Whole question is because I stumbled upon instructions to setup the NAC mgmt port as an additional relay target and it will passively sniff for DHCP fingerprinting. Obviously clients get DHCP either way, just with more delays if there's some form of load balancing. But RR would mean fingerprinting is inconsistent across devices.

Stand up for yourselves and stop letting douchebags tell you how to perform, what to do and do things that aren't in your job description.

Put your phone on DND, eat lunch and make people wait. Stop being a pushover pussy and you won't have to come to reddit to vent and hate everyone every morning at 9AM. 
 Have some self respect and stop self loathing. Our jobs are difficult enough. You don't need to hate your position because you don't have enough self respect to stand up to people and tell them to fuck off very nicely.

 Recently I've moved to EVE-NG as my platform of choice, and it's great, except I can't for the life of me figure out how to start a docker container with (1) startup commands and (2) environment variables, both of which are required to run a containerized EOS. The EVE-NG team has not given much support on this subject, so I here I am asking you fine folks for help.
 Has anyone here gotten cEOS and/or custom docker images to run in EVE-NG?
 EDIT: Why am I getting downvoted? If you do a search on the subject you'll find that there is only ONE resource talking about how to run custom docker images on EVE-NG, but that is using docker-in-docker, which I want to avoid due to the performance tax. (The whole reason I'm using cEOS is to get better performance...). Plus the use-case for docker-in-docker is much more complex than starting a container with simple environmental variables.

 I put up a post over a year ago complaining about policy and management at my job, you can view on my profile. TLDR of that post was management was changing policy flip flopping back and forth and making our jobs harder because of it.
 I spent a lot of time at the old place complaining, and wallowing in my self pity. Thinking that I wasnt good enough and that there was no way another company would hire me. I blamed management for my unhappiness which is partially true but in the end it was my fault for staying and letting them make me unhappy.
 On the flip side yesterday I had my 6 month review at my new job that went spectacular. I found a place that is supportive and listens to employees to improve the company. It's not perfect by any means but no where really is. Since I've been here my mental health has improved, I've been eating better and I've lost ~60lbs. I'm learning more than ever and have the ability to move up in the company.
 Please remember that no job is worth your health. If you are not happy or your health, both physical or mental is declining, leaving is better than staying. Yes I'm aware that is easier said than done it took me almost 10 months to decide and actively look for another job but it worked out in the end.

 This time I put my name in the hat as did another coworker (he applied the first time as well but was passed up.)
 I met with our CTO today and was told that the organization was going with the coworker over me, essentially because of seniority even though I’d be a better fit.
 This is a guy who
  
Calls people on their days off because he’s too lazy to spend five minutes looking for an answer
 Has to be told/shown multiple times to do something (I’m starting to wonder if he can read and write)
 Does nothing to improve things and does not work smart
 Won’t take ownership of stuff and will try anything to push work off to others or weasel out of it
 Staff outside our main office specifically complain about him
  
What’s worse is I was given permission from our other coworkers on the team to use as a reference as well as a respected manager outside our group. I don’t believe he had any. While I haven’t seen his resume, I don’t believe he’s the better qualified candidate (other than being in IT longer.)
 The boss says the decision was not his and leadership/hr overruled him.
 I may give it a few months to see how things pan out but I’ll likely leave if I can find an employer who’ll match or beat my benefits.

 I installed an ER8411 VPN router in our office and I configured an IPsec VPN. My client device is a Windows 10 PC on another network. It connects to the VPN using TheGreenBow.
 I get good speeds, around 70 MB/s for file transfer, which is good for me.
 The problem I have is weird, and probably something I don't know. When I try copying a file from any remote device to my local client, it will allocate the client's ram for the size of that file. If I start a 5GB file copy, quickly the Ram usage will ramp up by 5GB. I need to transfer 60GB files, so that's a big issue. Once the transfer is done, it DOES NOT free the ram...
 I do not have that problem if I launch a copy from another drive or a local NAS.
 Any idea or explaination?
 Thanks!

 It seems like a waste of time having to answer IT questions through Teams chat when we can just find the answers quickly ourselves ya? Currently stuck with a minimal helpdesk system without any of these kinds of features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Was wondering if someone can provide an example of how to configure MEC on a Cisco C9500 that is configured in a StackWise Virtual Link, please? 
 For example: 
 In Arista, they use MLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation). I know how to configure MLAG in the Arista using Port Channel and MLAG configuration. To do so, I select the interface, for example, interface ethernet 2, under that interface, then I create the “channel-group 20“ with the number and mode. Then I move to the interface “port-channel 20”, and associate that port channel with the mlag number (let’s say 20 as well). I'll do the same on the second switch so both switches know they are part of an LACP/Port-Channel with MLAG connection in case switch one goes down. 
 Just need to know how I would configure MEC on the Cisco C9500 in a Stackwise Virtual mode.
 ​
 Thanks!

 The phone keeps ringing off the hook, and my half eaten Wendy's cheeseburger sits hardening on my desk. 
 I am paid 1/4 of what the people I'm helping are making, yet I am expected to know the inner workings of every software or complicated piece of equipment that they rely on.
 Ironically it is them who are allowed to slack off and complain to no end when something doesn't go their way.
 Every day there is another self important asshole who thinks their job is more important than everyone else's.
 Ironically, it is these same "overworked" and "stressed out" individuals whom I see heading to the cafeteria 10+ times a day, when I haven't finished my lunch in a week.
 I am only one man to 600 tech inept employees. 
 My question is, why is there no computer competency test for positions that are paying $100k + a year?? What is this absolute bullshit.
 Would you hire a carpenter who doesn't know how to hold a hammer?
 It's twenty twenty fucking 3 is it not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running into an issue at work that I am unable to figure out and I was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on to what might be happening.
 I have a device on my facility floor that is using a Static IP of:
 10.239.134.177
 255.255.255.0
 10.239.134.1
 The DNS servers are set correctly as well.
 When I run an ipconfig /all
 I get 2x IPv4 Addresses:
 10.239.134.177 (Preferred)
 255.255.255.0
 Then I also get a second IPv4 Address:
 10.255.255.241 (Preferred)
 255.0.0.0
 It is causing issues on my network because the second address seems to be taking priority.
 When I reboot the machine it only shows 1 address, but after about 15 mins the network icon in the taskbar gets a yellow triangle saying (no internet) and when you run the ipconfig /all you see the second IP has come back.
 The device does have 2 NIC's but one of them is disabled and we are only using one.
 https://ibb.co/fX35xxM
 This is a link to the screenshot of the ipconfig.
 Thank you for any help you can provide.

 Tried numerous ways to get them to install (MPCMDRUN commands, downloading the direct installer from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/defenderupdates, etc.). Always ends up with the same 80508007. None of these servers (mix of physical and VM) are low on memory or any other resources. The last successful update version was 1.383.1289.0 (from 3/8/2023).
 Is anyone else seeing any issues like this?

 For context remote users use SonicWall VPN and my experience is the fastest fix is a simple reboot. Emailed instructions; will send texts if asked; I will even take a phone call and politely explain to reboot. "Hey just reboot and your issue will be solved. This thing just hangs up from time to time."
 After a few minutes The number of times I hear the words "Did that; same error" only to find their uptime being over a day is increasingly annoying. 
 This feels new and I think people are getting dumber and lazier. Been in IT 20+ years and I thought we'd be passed this.

 I am by no means a network professional but this has me curious. Could a hub cause problems for the rest of a network if used at its extreme reach, or is it ok so long as it doesn't cause problems among the devices it serves?

 No idea if other countries do this but in the UK its common for kids (age 15-17) before they go to college to do a week or two of 'work experience' .
 Anyway, this kid is coming here as he wants to get into IT and/or Dev so he's spending 2 days with our software engineers, 2 days with our test equipment design team (we're a manufacturing facility) and he's with me for one day on Monday. He gets to rate the experience so naturally there is some friendly competition amongst us as to which was more interesting, and I only get one day.
 ​
 What the hell do I trust a 16 year old child with that:
 - is engaging and not intensely boring
 - shows a good overview of what working in an 'IT' support/ops environment is like
 - can be explained quickly as time is limited
 - doesn't involve giving him the keys to the kingdom or other such compliance nightmares
 - doesn't involve me talking at him for 8 hours.
 - can be done in production because I'm not in tomorrow, only found out about this on Monday and haven't had time to set up any kind of lab he can happily break

 As it stands the OS drives are in slots 1 and 2, with the rest being allocated to data.
 When I go to create the Logical Drives using Intelligent Provisioning, I can see that, there are 4 drives allocated to Port 1 on the RAID controller, 4 drives allocated to Port 2 on the RAID controller, and 2 drives connected to Port 3 on the RAID controller.
 The issue is that the x2 OS drives are intermixed with the x8 drives and not separated under port 3 for the expansion bay. Does it matter which drives are connected to which ports on the RAID controller? Or should I just be able to cut up into logical drives no matter where the drives are plugged in?
 Edit: and also from a sysadmin perspective, what would be the least confusing configuration for this setup. To have the OS drives in bays 1 and 2, or have them in the last slots 9 and 10 and be in the expansion bay.

 We have a Sharp BP-70C45
 ​
 And Odd thing is happening. We have MS365
 I have setup scan to email with smtp auth(Option1)
 I cannot use Direct Send(Option2) as it need to go to external recipeints as well
 I cannot use SMTP Relay(Option3) as it is a dynamic IP, I tried but it fails/does not work, even if I put the dynip on the sfp and connector
 ​
 So what is happening is I cannot scan to email to multiple recipients in my domain
 ie ([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com), [user2@mydomain.com](mailto:user2@mydomain.com)) it gives me a time out error on the printer
 ​
 I can send to a single recipient in my domain ([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com))
 I can send to multiple external recipients to any external domain([userext1@ext1.com](mailto:userext1@ext1.com), [user2@extother2.com](mailto:user2@extother2.com))
 ​
 But if I try to send to multiple users in my domain ie([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com), [user2@mydomain.com](mailto:user2@mydomain.com))
 it will give me a timeout error on the printer 
 OR 
 If I try to send to a mix of external([user1@somedomain.com](mailto:user1@somedomain.com)) and internal([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com))
 It will send to the external but will give a timeout error for the internal. 
 ​
 So not sure if its something with the printer or MS365, anyone seen something like this before

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 Just looking for some advice. I have been looking at creating an internal Ansible infrastructure from scratch for our small team. The master server setup and inventory is quite easy and the box is easily screwed down re: the security as far as OS and access for certain groups, correct access rights, logging, locked down firewalls as well. You know, the sane usual settings.
 One thing that really worries me is the fact that in order to use the Ansible setup properly we are going to have to create keys that have no password, are exempted from 2FA rules and can switch to root level access. 
 The information on these servers "is the business" so if our data got lost it would be the end of the business if that makes sense. If the box got compromised it would be game over.
 In order to get the key they would have to exploit some creds to get into the box but its the sheer lateral movement/access that is gotten if these keys are misappropriated that worries me.
 Thoughts?

 ​
 This whole Exchange Online / Hybrid-Configuration topic has been bugging me for a long time now. I hope someone might be able to help me.
 ​
 Following scenario: We have a Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online and an on-prem Active Directory (NO AD Connect). So at the moment we always have to create two users: one for the M365 tenant / Exchange Online and one user for the on-prem AD.
 ​
 Is it possible to merge the on-prem AD users with the M365 users? I did find some tutorials on how to configure Azure AD Connect using soft and hard matching. BUT: I also read on some forum, that you must have an on-prem exchange in order for it to work properly (no further information was given). This on-prem Exchange is just used for communication between Exchange Online and the on-prem environment (no mailboxes etc. needed). How do I have to configure that on-prem Exchange? Just install it, configure hybrid mode and start creating users withing on-prem Exchange? Do I have to license the on-prem Exchange?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I've been working in an engineering team for a few years now (ISP). Mostly phasing out older stuff, helping out our SD teams and working on incidents that occurred. Also we're occasionally involved with on-boarding new clients, fitting their needs. And other projects (think: new PoPs etc).
 Honestly, it kinda feels 'stale'. I like to play new shiny stuff once in a while. play around with it, see if it fits our use. For example software/tooling for QoL, other hardware, else. 
 Reflecting on other engineering teams in other branches e.g. motorsports; they have engineers with a clear goal: win a race within certain rules. I don't think we (as NWE's) always have these clear rules. There is -however- one clear goal: it has to work. It mostly does not matter how (no clear rules).
 How would one create some kind of 'race' to squeeze every bit from a router. Having no jitter, or making sure you lose no packets in transit? Otherwise, i don't really feel being an engineer but more like a janitor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to give a headsup about this issue. We got two brand new Lenovo SR630 V2 servers with Broadcom 57414 NICs. Installed Lenovo ESXi 7.0.3 image from Lenovo site, see that the 1gb NICs show up in VmWare but 10gb nics 57414 don't show up. Troubleshooted half a day, installed latest firmware but nothing. Device itself is visible in esxi cli but not when calling esxcli nic command.
 Finally found theres an issue about it: https://datacentersupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/servers/thinksystem/sr630v2/7z71/solutions/tt1001-broadcom-57454-ocp-and-57414-ocp-nics-do-not-appear-in-uefi-after-flashing-fw-to-222173
 Downgrading the firmware back to 219.0.29.0 and then the nics showed up in VmWare
 Quite a big problem if server is unusable out of box and promised fix is coming by the end on April.

 I don't know if the community of r/sysadmin might help with my issue, see it as a message in a bottle and mods feel free to delete if it doesn't fit this sub requirements! 
 I'm having huge trouble with a OOM issue when running MariaDB :
 - Server specs : https://pastebin.com/qXCbBWLM
 - InnoDB Status : https://pastebin.com/p9aNVWqT
 - MySQLTuner report: https://pastebin.com/xfvVt1Nv
 The main issue is that even though MariaDB is allocated 20Gb for 'innodb_buffer_pool_size', it goes way up in memory consumption leading to this graph :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/5hxodSj)
 As we can see in this graph, it doesn't seem to be related to an activity spike :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/Y12CECY)
 And if we take a look at the buffer size (the issue started when the 'lowered' was 1Gb so we went for 24Gb and lowered it to 20Gb) :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/5hxodSj)
 I already tried to tweak some MariaDB configurations but struggle to find the culprit of this OOM issue. There is only MariaDB running on this server and the kernel log file shows me that only MariaDB is consuming RAM when the OOM occurs.
 Is this only an issue of too low RAM to run this database ?
 Any help is welcome and if I can provide any other information just ask, I'm getting reallllyyyy desperate ! Thank you for your reading and have a good day !

 I know that the client resolver on W10 switches to the second DNS server after trying and failing with the first server for 1 second. But when does it switch back? I know it does after a restart, but what about during regular operation? From my findings, Windows doesn't "balance" between servers. It sticks with the first one until the 1 second timeout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We have an on Prem AD server which sync's out users to AAD using Azure AD Connect.
 Recently the On Prem AD server went pop which obviously has stopped the sync. My plan over the course of the next month was to Fully migrate away from the on Prem server anyway as there is no need for it any more. All of our Microsoft services are cloud based. We have no on site applications. All machines are connected via Azure and linked up to intune. So really all we use the on Prem server for is creating accounts. 
 My question is... What would the implications be of just leaving the server in its current state seeing as though I was going to be getting rid of it anyway. Do the current users get converted to Cloud users automatically 
 ...or is it advisable to restore from backups and carry out the steps of stopping syncs at both ends etc.
 Thanks

 Eveything is working fine and all the informations about the server display (services, logs etc).
 But when I close the server manager and reopen it, the informations are gone and I have to click on "Manage As" on each server, to specify domain information again.
 Is there a way for the domain information to stay veen when i restart the server manager ?

 Our CIO left the company and the process to find a new one just finished and they landed with a CIO with 20+ years of experience in the field, after a few talks with the new CIO and he seems to have a lot of knowledge.
 My only issue is that he decided to change our entire OS infrastructure, from Windows to ChromeOS. I've asked him why the change, he said "ChromeOS is more secure and faster".
 I've never used ChromeOS, so I don't know what to expect on it. 
 I'm half tempted to learn the OS to improve my skills and knowledge, but at the same time, I don't wanna waste time learning something that I might not use much in the future if I change jobs or he leaves (the previous company where he worked started the transition back to windows after he left, the employees weren't happy with ChromeOS). 
 What do you guys think on this transition and what would you do in my shoes?

 I need to run a script, when a user does disconnect and reconnect to his/her RDP session on Windows 2022.

 What I tried is, to do this with a task manager job:
 If there is a new event 25 in Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational
 --> Extract the "User" variable and start a script
 ​
 <ValueQueries> <Value name='User'>Event/UserData/EventXML[@Name="User"]</Value> </ValueQueries> 
 and then:
 <Arguments>-File C:\Batch\test.ps1 -TargetUsername "$(User)"</Arguments> 
 ...but the variable is always empty.
 I also tried "%username%" but this one is always filled with one special user (I do not know, why) and not with the "reconnecting" user.

 Can you give me a hint on how to solve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I am not sure if this is the right sub but let me try. I work in accounting (EU) and every month i have to send 3-4 seperate files to 120+ different clients. The files are always saved in a folder named 01_jan, 02_feb ect. The content of the mail is always the same for every customer except the name. Is there any program out there that can automate this or even just a par of it? Do you have recomendations?
 Best Regards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there any cheaper/smaller firewall appliances that can do greater than 1Gb to 10Gb firewall throughput that don't have a lot of extra features. I don't need more than 2x SFP+ ports, don't need VPN capability. 
 I've tried looking at all the big names and they either have models that have all 1G ports or have ones that have way more 10G ports and features than I would need and can afford.
 The only options I've found so far is NetGate TNSR appliances, or Ubiquiti ER-8-XG-US.
 Edit: Cheaper would be <$10k USD or around that target.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am dealing with a fairly large Nutanix infrastructure 40+ nodes across several clusters and locations. We use it like you you would use a vmware or any other hypervisor to just run VMs. Nothing special no fancy services or scripting. 
 When I say every single upgrade I have done has failed or taken 8+ hours for something that should be 2 at the most, I mean every single upgrade. I can't find a single redeeming quality to this system. Every issue requires SSH access to the controller VMs, and either a pile of CLI or direct intervention from their support staff. In a 10+ year career I've never talked to support so much in such a short amount of time. Every firmware upgrade of the underlying host turns into a multi hour nightmare with crazy 2+ hour timeouts before a failure message. Every single feature down to what should be the simplest thing is manual, or a ratking of python scripts behind a sleek UI with bad progress reporting. Something as easy as upgrading the VM guest tools is a manual process with no automation. 
 I don't understand, what's the value add? How is this company maintaining customers?

But I want to think outside the box a bit; can we put some more safeguards on exactly who can encrypt data? Can we wholesale disallow via GPO the use of encryption on the OS? Can the OS/Admin have a system-wide "skeleton key" that can decrypt data regardless of encryption keys used? It can't just be about backups and malware prevention, cybersecurity needs to neutralize the threat itself, to de-fang encryption-abuse. Is anybody in cybersecurity thinking along these lines?

 We are a smallish organisation with 20 sites + 1 Datacenter headend all on MPLS. We currently have all the backup IPSec tunnels terminating on the core router (network core and MPLS headend) in the DC but I am looking to move the tunnels to a new/repurposed router to avoid SPOF.
 We have onprem (Datacenter) domain controllers and Office365/Azure AD in a hybrid setup.
 Hardware:
 Core router - Juniper SRX4600 in HA
 Repurposed Router - Juniper SRX1500 in HA
 The SRX4600 is beastly enough to handle the existing and future tunnels but I am just looking at a cleaner way to tie everything in. FYI - We are in locked in for a further 3 years with our MPLS provider.
 What is everyone doing nowadays with backup tunnels (besides ditching MPLS altogether for SDWAN and SASE/CASB :))

In my head I can't believe 4 years later the merchant account is still under my name, but this was a small mom/pop 14 employee kind of place.
 back story I created a payment website for an association and used a local merchant for the online payment processing portion.
 I have an email drafted and ready to go to his boss but what would ya'll do? Should I just reply to him and tell him I can't do this or is it better that his boss knows he's trying to get me to pretend I still work at the company by calling the merchant and letting them know to increase the limit of the online payment processor. Either way this blew my mind...

 cut over to a new firewall and moved the L3 interfaces from the router to the firewall behind a transit vlan 
 Prior to the cutover the interfaces were all being advertised out on bgp using network statement and route policy. Upon moving the interface to the firewall it appears that the router is no longer advertising those subnets into the BGP peering. Why could this be?
 Changes made: Transit subnet/interfaces created on router Static routes added to point routers to new location of the subnets Old interfaces deleted
 Troubleshooting: Pings to otherside of transit interface - pass Routes in local table - pass Advertised routes - fail

 Looking into new wireless hardware for this next fall for my district. I feel like reviews are all over the place... I'm hoping maybe you all can share your experience and advice on what has worked best for your district.
 We are a small district. Two buildings with 1200 students and 200 staff. Our environment is somewhat mixed. Students are 1to1 iPad, staff are 1to1 Mac Air, Chromebooks for assistants, and office staff have windows desktops.
 We are currently running 3 year old Aruba switches and 2 year old Unifi AC HD AP's. While I really haven't had many issues with the AP's, used Unifi in other districts and businesses for the last 8 years, I'm concerned UBNT may not be as focused as they use to be on the networking end.
 I'm considering staying with Unifi and purchasing U6 Enterprise AP's. Testing with them so far has gone well in classroom.
 But, I've also been considering Ruckus, Extreme or maybe Aruba based on bids I've received (I don't have any experience with any of those 3) I have had Meraki and I'm not a fan of the Meraki licensing model or hardware.
 Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been experiencing a strange DHCP issue the last few days. We are using Juniper Ex4300s as an L3 gateway, with UniFi access switching and wireless.
 Clients will send DHCP Discover to the router, which is then relayed to a Windows DHCP server. The server then sends an Offer, which is received by the client.
 This is where we run into issues. The client sends a DHCP Request, but the request never makes it to the Juniper gateway. This is mostly affecting our WiFi, so I am thinking it is the UniFi APs, but I haven't been able to find a resolution to this issue.
 DHCP Snooping is disabled. We have tested several different firmware versions on the APs, to no avail.
 EDIT: This is affecting wired clients as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I've got a client with a Catalyst 3850 stack, running on some old ass code 3.6.3. (bad i know, they arent even under support by cisco either)
 ​
 The issue they're having is ONLY the primary/master switch in the stack is functioning. All 3 other switches' interfaces aren't working. All commands show the stack is functioning as normal however...
 'show switch' shows all switches are a part of the stack no problem.
 ' show switch stack-ports' shows all is good with the stack cables
 Nothing in the logs is showing anything out of the ordinary, except for %SPI_FC-3-HIGH_WMARK_REACHED: Number of messages in the queue for channel 11 has reached maximum. Which i'm reading is a known bug on this code... shouldn't be an issue with stacking.
 We're able to reload all other switches individually with 'reload slot x' command, and reloading all other switches (except for the primary, because we dont want to reload the working one during business hours) didn't seems to fix it. After reloading the other member switches, they join back into the stack just fine. 
 ​
 The member switches' ports are simply just not coming up. It's showing no link activity like there's no cable even plugged in. Tried bouncing the ports, and unplugging/replugging in cables, no luck.
 ​
 Has anyone ever ran into this? The plan is to reboot the whole stack tonight after work hours to see if that fixes, which i'm hoping it does. It has an uptime of 2 years also.
 Any advice would be appreciated!!
 EDIT:: The reboot fixed it! Of course next step is to get them upgraded. Thanks for the responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We've had Cisco routers on order for over a year now and their ETA keeps getting pushed further out. I am wondering how prevalent different virtual router products such as VyOS, TNSR, or even CSR1K/CSR8K are in the enterprise non cloud environment for replacing traditional ethernet routers used for internet edge and private WAN connectivity. I understand there are some (very) large and small businesses that make use of them, but would like to understand how "ready" are they to replace traditional hardware-based internet/WAN routers? Most discussions around VyOS tend to be around home use rather than enterprise and VyOS/TNSR seem to be only occasionally mentioned in enterprise networking related discussions.
 Also, does anyone have experience with technical support for either? VyOS looks to be < $20K per year for unlimited installs and 1-4Hr support SLA. I feel I'd have a better time convincing management to try a products other than Cisco if they can be assured that they have decent support. There also aren't many concrete performance numbers published for VyOS but anecdotal evidence suggests that 10Gbps+ should be achievable even when hosted on ESXi. Are there any "gotchas" to look forward to with hosting any of these on ESXi as far as functionality, stability, and performance?
 Thank you all for taking the time to read this.

 I'm suffering with speed client speed issues with one of our stacks of Dell5548 switches (5 members).
 This presents as speed tests (iperf to a server, another client on the same stack or to WAN) performing at 0Mbps-990Mbps (speed fluctuates massively per second per client).
 We have 2 10Gbps fibre uplinks from our core in a port-channel, I've tried shutting each of these in turn to see if its a link issue but obviously the issue persists on the stack itself so I don't think its a link issue.
 The switches are stacked in "Ring" (port 1 on switch 1 to port 2 on switch 2, down to switch 5 where port 1 goes back to port 2 switch 1).
 I've tried enabling BDPUGuard on all non-trunk ports to no avail. Our core stack is our root bridge for RSTP. I've added (and then removed) portfast fro…]]></summary>

 First question — it’s a fairly small office. In total we’ll have less than 20 dynamic clients and we’re currently using a Meraki device. What hardware will I need to accomplish this? 
 Second — for shared resources (i.e., printers) what’s the easiest way to have a device span multiple vlans in this way?

 My situation
 Worked my way through the standard sysadmin role to now being more of an IT (project) management role.
 I work in an international organization with IT colleagues spread in lots of countries.
 I am working from HQ but mostly my role is supporting/managing local IT colleagues and to make their life easier.
 These local IT colleagues purchase hardware based on HQ recommendations mostly, albeit these are often not hard recommendations - in areas like accessories (keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.) there is a lot of flexibility on purchasing whatever fits the local organization best, although there are selected recommendations in some areas.
  
 We want to provide all IT colleagues with a repository of recommended hardware in all general categories.
 What would be the best way to go about doing that?
 Ideally it should:
 * Cover basic information for all relevant device models divided in categories (mouse, keyboard, etc.)
 * Provide reviews/insights from other local IT colleagues (e.g. 5-star rating, comments/reviews)
 * Include links to our recommended resellers for purchase
  
 We do have confluence and SharePoint available as tools.
 I don't have much experience with SharePoint myself and I do know that confluence will struggle once you work with lots of information on a single page (especially tables) - which is bound to happen after some time of adding hardware to the list.
 Neither of these options (at least as far as I can tell) would provide an easy way of achieving the goal.
 We also have ServiceNow but I don't think this use-case fits an ITSM solution.  
  
 Did any of you do something similar already?
 If yes, how did you do it?
  
 I appreciate any input you could share with me! :)

It would need to be able to inventory servers (both Windows and Linux), switches (HP/Aruba), access points (Aruba), firewalls (Palo Alto), printers, and maybe a few other device types. This solution would need to be able to scan multiple subnets, and preferably filter out just the device types mentioned (for instance, I don't need this tool to inventory desktops/laptops).
 As a bonus, does anyone know of any software that could scan web servers and keep an inventory of all websites hosted on those servers (we are a state agency, and host a LOT of websites)? This can be a separate solution from the above recommendations.
 Thanks for the help!

It’s not that hard and doesn’t take a lot of time but it’s frustrating that he’s done this for weeks in a row and refuses to try to do it himself.
 I’ve walked him through it 5 times and he still has no idea how to even start. I suggested an aptitude test to my coworkers and they agreed, but one wasn’t put in place.
 What do you guys think? Should there be an aptitude test for management positions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just graduated college a few months ago with an information systems type degree. I have an over hour long commute 1 way to work. Pay is good. I started full time a few months after graduation as a Sys Admin 1. I am terrified. I feel like I don't know anything and ask too many questions to my team of less than 10 supporting almost 1000 with all sorts of MS365 and AD and SCCM things which I never heard about in school. I dont feel like I belong. There is so much I don't know. I love PCs and I love hardware an I get along with most of the users and they like me. I just feel like I don't belong. I am the youngest by about 10 years on my team with everyone being there for a long time and being pretty close. They have got me working with vulnerability management and it's interesting but I feel like I don't know enough to do much. I can look at the CVEs and find the KBs online but I don't know where to go from there. I just feel like I am in way over my head. I don't feel like I know enough or can do enough to really do much. I dont know what to do. I don't even know if this post is appropriate but I don't know anyone else who understands and I don't want to talk to anyone at work about it. I feel like it would only lead to bad things if I went to a coworker and was like "Hey, I don't feel like I know what I'm doing and I am extremely nervous about my job. I just want to do well." There really hasn't been any training mainly just 5 minute crash courses do this do that click this. Then left to my own. I am absolutely terrified of fucking this up. I got such a good job with amazing pay and benefits out the gate and I feel like I don't fit. Thanks for reading.

 Does anyone have any experience with docking stations that work? I'm going crazy trying to find a proper docking station that works reliably.. 
 I've tried so many different devices, all kinds of Lenovo to Iiglo to belkin. I just purchased a Lenovo 32" monitor with built in docking and it works great, but it doesn't have an ethernet port or any display output for daisy chaining several screens which is a big minus.

 currently i'm trying to set up the connection to multiple NFS-Shares on the same Server (This setup is non-negotiatible)
 First i set up the connection to 1 NFS-Share which worked fine after some tweaking. A part of this journey was to create 2 keys in
 HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\Default
 The keys are "AnonymousUID" and "AnonymousGID".
 Now the Problem is that with a different NFS-Share i will have different GID's, but regedit doesnt allow a second key with the same name.
 How i can i make this work with 2 different GID-values?

 I'm trying to connect 4 different iscsi targets provided by a NAS with powershell. I don't want to connect them all at once but rather separately, one at a time (first target1, then target2 and so on).
 So far I've had success geting the target names with get-iscsitarget and piping this to a select-string which then chooses the target I want to connect (target1 for the first target). I then pipe that to connect-iscsitarget but here's my problem: This will assign the first available driveletter to the target. I want to assign specific letters, for example target1 gets W:, target2 gets X: and so on).
 But I cannot for the life of me find the command needed for this. All I can find is how to get driveletters from already connected targets and similat stuff.
 Any ideas? Am I missing something here?
 Thanks and have a good one!

 I was wondering if AD CS has an option to revoke an old certificate if a computer requests a new computer certificate.
 We have several machines who are getting rebuild every week which request a certificate with our CA. I would like to have the certificates which got request before the client got re-installed to be revoked, but I dont see any option which allows me to do this.
 Does anyone know if this is an option within AD CS?

What is the best way to take a golden config and push out something that ensures all other switches have exactly the same config as the golden switch?
 We have Cisco Prime, not sure if that has a feature to do this. But I am also somewhat comfortable with python and ansible. I know with ansible, I have done ansible diff to find differences, just not sure how to go about enforcing changes based off that.
 Just trying to find an easier way than wiping all the switches and putting a new config on them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Yesterday we had an alert from Microsoft 365 Defender (our Licenses are on 365 E5) notifying us of “Ransomware-linked emerging threat activity group detected “. Yikes!
 To cut a long story short, our security stack has contained the threat and the single device in question is nuked – We looped in 3rd party security to sense check everything.
 The threat was a Gootloader infection and Google suggests this is particularly nasty and sophisticated. The payload is a zip file with a .js file inside and from our investigation, the .js script needs to be executed, launched via WScriptexe. We implement best practice in our IT stack and are on-top of hardening our environment where ever possible. In this instance the payload was downloaded to a temp directory where Applocker blocks execution. But had the zip/.js file been downloaded to the desktop, it would have potentially executed.
 1 suggested rudimentary mitigation for this is to change the file association of .js files (via Group Policy) to open with Notepad so if a user does click a .js file, it will harmlessly open in notepad - We have done this. 
 But I have seen further recommendations to do the same for .vbs, .vbe, .jse, .hta and .wsf. I’m wondering if anyone else does this and if this could break anything for end users?

 My boss has handed me his old work issued Samsung A10 that is completely locked down using SOTI mobicontrol. The kicker is that the company that this phone belongs to doesn't exist anymore and so we are unable to get an admin to unlock the phone. Furthermore, I have contacted SOTI directly and because the company doesn't exist anymore they don't have permission to unlock it so they can't help me.
 I can't seem to figure out a way to unlock it - they have me beat at every turn.
 - Developer options is blocked
 - In recovery mode, there is no option to factory reset the phone
 - I am able to get into the settings for about a minute before the mobicontrol kicks in when I restart the phone - otherwise settings is completely disabled
 - The factory reset setting is completely greyed out.
 - In recovery mode, the bootloader is blocked out | when I try to open it, it just says downloading forever with a green screen
 Any methods I can try to get this phone reset or alternatively get soti mobicontrol off the device? Or is the device doomed for eternity?
 Any help would be much appreciated!

For some reason this relative decided rather than going to me when they had a problem they would run straight to the local "repair shop" as he apparently was chatted up by one of their staff while he was at the chippy.
 This "repair shop" (and I use this dubiously) has made a fucking botch to put it lightly. They claimed he had a virus and that his "hard drive" (actually an SSD) was destroyed by it and he would need a replacement which he happily agreed to. They installed a "new" hard drive and sent it back to him, obviously with slower performance on acc. of having an SSD swapped for a HDD and no effort made to reinstall any of the laptop's basic drivers which can be pulled off the manufacturer's site with a few minutes on Googles, so this relative had no sound, no WiFi (lucky they use a cable connection, really!) and a prompt to activate Windows.
 When they took it back, they had the sense to call me this time. When I went back with this relative, they had kindly replaced his hard drive with a "solid state drive" and would only charge him £150, what a fucking deal! I actually had a look at the laptop at the shop and it was in the same state as before, no effort to reinstall any drivers, probably was just the same SSD they took out reinstalled and sold back to him at cost, and a prompt to activate Windows. I quite bluntly told them to fuck off, gave them an earful and walked out with my relative and the laptop in tow. Considering either legal or lethal action to get these tw@s to stop bothering him.
 Also, the fucking screws are threaded on the underside so good luck to me getting into that fucker again. At least they had the decency to install another SSD but that's nearly £100 of this relative's money down the fucking drain.

 We've just made the move from Slack to Teams, and I want to close the gmail accounts completely. These accounts don't have phone numbers or alternate emails for verification, and I got through 10 using my mobile number but even after waiting a week I can't use it any further ( Unavailable because of too many failed attempts. Try again in a few hours. )
 What's the best way to either get in touch with Google or otherwise get these accounts blown off the face of the earth?

 A friend of mine works at Company A, and they have just been purchased by Company B.
 Both Company's have their own MSP, neither have any in-house IT.
 Company B's MSP are charging £11k to migrate Company A's O365 Tenancy away from Company A.
 There are 25 Users in this tenancy.
 I think this is very excessive in terms of cost, but I am not 100% what is involved so maybe it is correct.
 Does anybody have experience with this and can indicate if this cost is reasonable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 we currently have a strange issue.
 Our customer has 6 AVD session hosts with FSLogix in use.
 The issue: Sometimes a specific program won't start anymore on the vm a user is connected to. They have to connect with one of the other session hosts. On that session host it works for 1-2 days and afterwards the same issue occurs.
 The software is not installed on the vms but is started directly from a mapped network drive. It doesn't add or edit registry keys and only caches files in one specific folder in AppData. We already excluded that folder from the FSLogix redirection but it didn't make a difference.
 The only solution that works is to delete the FSLogix profile and create a new one.
 Additionally, Excel doesn't seem to work great either. Users have to restart it every few minutes because of freezing and crashing. Same thing, if the FSLogix profile will be deleted and be newly created it works again for a few days.
 So it seems there is something wrong with FSLogix. We already updated to the newest version and tried both normal caching and cloud cache.
 Weirdly I couldn't find anything or anyone on google regarding to this issue.
 Did anyone of you experience similiar issues or has an idea how to fix this? 
 Thanks in advance.

 We have Roaming Profiles and Folder Redirection reasonably heavily deployed amongst our on-premises clients. Recently a number of our long term staff who were very experienced with setting these up and troubleshooting issues with these have left, and the replacements we hired have no experience. RP and FR have been pretty stable for us, but we get a couple of issues a month I guess, and we aren't really having much luck getting on top of them. 
 I am keen to track down some resources on setting up and troubleshooting Roaming Profiles, including slow logins, errors regarding logging on with locally cached profile, and other common issues like a new profile directory being created locally each time a user logs in.
 I'd also be interested in tracking down information on how to turn off roaming profiles if we want to stop using them, without losing the profile data and just general troubleshooting in this area. 
 Totally happy to pay for training materials, just really keen to get the new people up to snuff so we don't spend hours and hours troubleshooting and or fixing RP Issues.

 we have had a strange problem with our print server (Win2019 1809) for quite some time.
 If employees try to print a document in the morning, it is sent to the print server, but not printed out immediately. The document is not printed until an admin connects to the server via RDP connection. After the RDP connection, all documents are printed out. This applies to all printers that are connected via a print server.
 1.) The print server can be reached permanently via ping, even in the morning.
 2.) LAN card (Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power) is not checked.
 3.) VMware Tools up to date
 I suspect that during the night some service hangs up. However, I have no idea which one.
 Have you already had a similar phenomenon and can you give me a tip in which event log I can find it?

 Im working at a startup selling saas. 
 We have just got our first client in eu and are looking at more in other countries and struggling to figure out how to respect data sovereignty. 
 We have a very basic IIS server mysql server and this runs everything. We would like to place a server in eu and other countries, and store the data and files for those countries users, on those servers.
 The catch is, there is a few "global" databases that need to be accessed on all servers. 
 Running the application on our current server and using a database in another country does not seem to work well due to latency. I have tested installing IIS on this second location, using a different domain and connecting back to our global databases so only certain requests have additional latency. 
 But this all seems really stupid, surely there is a better way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider the following hub and spoke topology where each vnet spoke utilizes a different front-end IP on the respective load balancer within the hub network for forced tunneling for ingress traffic to be inspected by the pair of NVAs in the hub network.
 https://imgur.com/dYSzKUo
 We can assume that each NIC is assigned a route table with a UDR that points 0.0.0.0/0 to the respective IP (load balancer IPs) shown in the diagram. We can assume that the NVA's are running active/active and are configured as backend pool members for each load balancer in the diagram.
 ​
 If both of the load balancer back end pools are configured in the following order:
 Load balancer in 10.0.0.0/24
  
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.0.10
 
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.0.11
 
 Load balancer in 10.0.1.0/24 
  
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.1.10
 
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.1.11
 
 What would be the effect, if any, upon traffic if the order of one of the back-end pool members were reversed so that it is displayed as follows:
 Load balancer in 10.0.1.0/24 
  
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.1.11
 
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.1.10
 
 ​
 To provide context, I am trying to understand in what instances does the order of the backend pool on azure load balancers impact and effect traffic flow, and what considerations need to be understood here for this to make sense.
 I would appreciate the communities thoughts on this to help my understanding on this subject.
 Thanks!

 I have an layer 3 switch (Aruba 8320) at the core of my network, it is doing all the routing and is configured with the final route as 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.0.18 (my firewall), however I want to re-route the traffic from VLAN 66 (10.66.0.0/21) to another device (different interface on firewall, as I can enable a captive portal for that vlan only). if these two devices are directly connected I assume the I do the following to re-route the traffic.
 Configure firewall interface: 192.16.30.5/29
 Configure layer 3 switch interface: 192.168.30.6/29
 Configure route in layer 3 switch: ip route 10.66.0.0/21 192.168.30.5
 the bit I'm unsure of is do I need to configure a vlan for 19.168.30.0/29
 interface vlan 30
 description Guest_Wireless_VLAN
 ip address 192.168.30.2/29
 active-gateway ip mac e2:ff:5e:ac:09:07
 active-gateway ip 192.168.30.1
 and change the route to: ip route 10.66.0.0/21 192.168.30.1 or keep it the same

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I would like to know your opinion regarding how change and risk management is done in your organizations. I am particularly interested in risk management (not security risk but potential impacts due to change).
 The ITIL framework is useful however there is an element that I struggle with, potential customers impacts, normally when defining potential, we might think as the worst case scenario, but even small simple changes could have big potential impact if we consider a typo when adding a new policy in an existing vrf, someone might say deleting or modifying policies are riskier, and I would normally agree, but when it comes to typos, missing a statement, wrong IP, community tag, etc, could have severe consequences.
 In my organization we have defined these categories to come with a number, the number will fall under ITIL thresholds, P1-P4, these are the categories:
 Potential Customer Impact, it is based on the activity being performed and the amount of customers potentially impacted.
 Type Element, it is a grouping that depends on type of element, for example, a core IP layer element would have higher value than a Voice or Data(Application layer) element.
 Service Area, based on the geographical area that the element is providing services, example, it could be region of a country, a state, it could be within a city.
 Service Density, amount of actual services that the element is supporting.
 As you can see, Type, Service Area and Service Density are based on the element where the work is going to be performed, but the Potential Customer Impact is based on the activity itself only.
 My struggle is finding a good balance in the risk management for the activity itself as there are many details like typos or missing small pieces of configuration that could create a big impact even though the activity itself could be a simple one. 
 How does your organization manage risk from changes? What ideas can you share with me based on the above?
 Thanks in advance.

 Unfortunately rfc3768 comes with plenty of hoops and bugs on vyos currently and I was wondering what is the likely outcome if I disable rfc3768 support? keepalived will send GARP packages on failover and then resend it after a delay. Do you have experience with equipment missing/ignoring garp packets and not failing over?

 "I used to play pranks on people who didn't lock their computer. Now I just lock it for them. If I see someone in a coffee shop walk away and leave their computer unattended, rather than being a dick I just keep an eye on it until they come back"
 Obviously heavily paraphrased - but that was the jist of it. 
 I know it is a long shot - but I am trying to find this article again and drawing a complete blank. Every time I try to google it I get hundreds of pages of search results for the best pranks to pull on people who leave their computers unlocked.
 And yes - switching their mouse from right to left handed or rotating their screen 90 degrees is amusing, but not what I am looking for right now...
 Thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction.

I know I can create the VLANS and use IRB/SVI (logical ports) for the VLAN routing and connect the switches with trunk links and setup some DHCP forwarding (ip-helper) addresses on the IRB interfaces to leverage the DHCP ranges on the Fortigate 100F, But I wasn't sure about the connection from the switch to the Fortigate. Is that considered a trunk link too? I would think it would just be a standard link and then you have the routing to the VLANs setup on the router with static/dynamic routes or whatever. Or is there an easier way to do this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 I thought it was a standard phishing mass attack posing as a bank then hitting lots of people to try to get people with an account there, but after looking into it they're actually coming from Capital One. At least they're coming from the same IPs and domains as confirmed legit Capital One emails. 
 So far we've gotten at least a hundred of these emails. They have all the looks of a phishing campaign. They're hitting old and disabled accounts as well as current legit ones. 
 There's nothing malicious I've found in the emails. The embedded links all go to the correct sites. So I'm not sure what the point of the emails are. 
 I've reached out to their abuse email address, but doubt I'll hear much back. 
 Has anyone else seen anything going on like this?

 Boss -
 I have an e-mail out to VAR to confirm lead times of both platform APs, but barring some notable surprise on delivery dates – I’m landing on Juniper Mist for (Corporate Office). As discussed briefly today, I narrow the conversation down to (3) primary areas of focus.
 Performance + Capability There were some noteworthy differentiators re: how similar functions are approached between the platforms. Mist APs were designed w/ an additional radio dedicated to nothing but collecting analytics for proactive correlation and RF optimization. Aruba has attempted to copy the same behavior…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Recently I've configured HSRP on our core switches. Because of the physical limitations of our fiber connections, we only have one trunk interface as the heartbeat interface between the two core switches. I set Core Sw1 as primary for all VLANs and Core Sw2 as the secondary for all VLANs. The configurations were successful and when I pull the ethernet cable going to our ASA, the traffic still flows through Core Sw2. However, when I unplug Core Sw1, we lose connection on the entire network. 
 Quickly explaining our Core to ASA connection: the connection from Core Sw1 and Core Sw2 is a single cable connection from each of the Core Switch. We only have one ASA running on the network at the moment.
 What could be causing this problem? I brought up setting up STP root manually so that the VLANs have a cost to follow to the Distribution then to Core Switches, but my Supervisor is insisting that doesn't matter. If I can get a clear technical explanation as to why our failover isn't happening when Core Sw1 loses power it will be very helpful.

 I have 2x 2019 domain controllers. Deployed and promoted 2x 2022 DC's. Waited a few days for replication to happen. Moved FSMO roles to the new DC's, demoted the first 2019 DC. Shutdown the 2nd 2019 server... then all hell broke loose. Apparently, the 2 new DC's are still waiting for initial replication to complete. The old 2019 server is saying it's been 392 days since it connected with a partner and won't replicate with any others until it does so.
 I screwed up by not checking my DC logs before shutting removing the first DC. Let that be a lesson to everyone doing an upgrade. Always check your logs.
 Now I am stuck with 2 DC's who are waiting for initial replication to complete with another DC who thinks it is too out of date to talk to anyone. What are my options? How can I tell the old DC that it can replicate with other devices? Can I force the new DC's to believe what they have been transferred is a complete sync?
 EDIT:
 I was able to resolve my issue by going on to the 2019 DC and changing the MaxOfflineTimeInDays to beyond the number of days that the DC thought it had been disconnected by issuing the following command and then restarting the DFSR service:
 wmic.exe /namespace:\\root\microsoftdfs path DfsrMachineConfig set MaxOfflineTimeInDays=450
 After that, I forced replication on both the new 2022 DC's who were able to complete initial synchronization. Thanks to everyone for their help!

 My original plan was to use spare Meraki MS120's as the breakouts, but the MSP said it was a bad idea due to licensing, despite me showing them a known working config for exactly this use case. Instead they recommended 2 dumb L2 switches.
 I'm not a network person specifically, but I can handle the basics of Meraki. I'm just not sure what config is needed for these 1000's.
 If I follow what my plan was for the MS120's, this is what the config would look like for the 1000's
 How wrong is this? And if this is somehow the right idea, I'm assuming there is more to do on the config...any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All. We are an IT consulting form and commonly perform site surveys for clients. Most of our clients have small to medium sized sites with between 5-20 APs. Lots of small warehouse clients that we do this for.
 Currently we use free predictive wireless heatmapping tools, and the free Wi-Fi analyzer tool to provide heatmaps and recommendations to clients. We basically use the existing AP placements and predictive heatmap tool to make an approximated heat map, then go onsite and use Wi-Fi analyzer to confirm the accuracy of the predictive heatmap and look for interference and optimal channels to set. It's pretty manual but fairly easy/not complex for us to do.
 Also we help them by recommending Wi-Fi settings such as the channels, etc. This has seemingly been enough for our clients and they've been happy with the results. We're able to make plenty of recomendations using our method.
 We've actually had clients tell us that another competitor came in and did a survey with other (paid) tools and the reports were overly confusing to them and took too long.
 We're starting to raise our prices for site surveys more towards what our competitors are charging, so I'm looking into paid site survey tools to see if they can provide anymore value to clients or efficiency on our end. 
 What would ya'll recommend? We do around 1-2 surveys a month, mostly for small clients like I described above. I would prefer something cloud based, something we can easily install/license on our laptops (for our team of 5 engineers), no physical tool, and affordable (don't think we need something like Ekahau for these smaller surveys?). Right now I'm looking at NetSpot. 
 Please let me know what you would recommend and why.

 Networking past a layer 2/3 switch. I'm plenty capable of doing all kind of fancy things with networks, but truthfully I just hate it. I can't stand doing network planning and carving out subnets, managing VIPs, QoS, all the VLANs, etc. etc. It's just boring and tedious to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a result of a merger, we're moving two schools into the same new building and we're planning the new network accordingly. Within the first couple years, the two schools will operate independently, however staff from both schools will be sharing staffrooms, printers, libraries and halls. We want to ensure that, whatever the solution, network resources belonging to the two schools are safely kept isolated.
 At the moment, one school is running users and computers in a Windows Workgroup in a very simple scenario, while the second school has a more advanced setup, which is depicted here: https://i.ibb.co/8XVYw3F/unnamed-1.jpg
  
Core LAN (not into a VLAN) for on premise trusted Windows devices and AD servers
 Staff VLAN, for BYOD devices and mobile phones
 Guest VLAN for students :school chromebooks and BYOD
 Printers VLAN, shared with the above LANs and VLANs, inbound only traffic
 PBX VLAN, runs traffic from DECT and softphones
  
Assuming that, as for the merger, users and computers from the first school will be moved into an AD Domain, we could think of two possible choices:
  
Logically segregate users and computers using two domains, and two "zones", which implies duplicating the above network design. Manage two domains, two isolated groups of WIFI networks, plus a shared network, which would be more tedious to manage, but maybe more secure, or
 Integrate users and computers into a unique domain, manage a shared network infrastructure, ensuring that a granular and hardened access control to resources is in place. More flexible, but more prone to "attacks" if not properly designed
  
Of course, brand new network appliances will be thrown in: switches, APs, routers and firewalls.
 With all the above in mind, what solution would you choose? What are your suggestions?

 I have a design question here… seeking wisdom to prevent me from possibly painting myself into a corner. Regarding the phase 1 ikev2 policies, specifically on the Cisco ASA… how should the order look and is there a better way to number all of them?
 Like should a more secure policy be a lower index number than a less secure policy? If you order and index them poorly – could anything be impacted?
 I guess there have been 3 network engineers here in the last 2 years and I see very random numbering... even a random ass Policy 71... it just screams bad design to me but I'm not familiar with the topic well enough to pin point it.
 Any tips/wisdom is appreciated.

 However my whole team (servicedesk) has noticed a very senior manager starting to really behave strangely. We’re very astute when it comes to noticing brain fog, tiredness, distraction; it’s none of those things. 
 Is there anything I should do other than provide more attentive support? Let HR know, or an even more senior leader?

 In particular my company just upgraded from some old ASAs to a MX-105 in HA, it was a bitch to set up the static routes between a old Cisco switch and a MX. One of the perks is being able to configure SAML in Azure AD. It just seems like alot more wholesome and customizable way to allow and configure Anyconnect VPN access with MFA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be a long shot... But I'm hoping that somewhere out there, someone has faced the same issue and maybe even found a fix.
 We have a bunch of Windows 10 Pro clients, and some Windows 11 Pro clients, which were initially on-prem domain joined, but have since become hybrid joined with AAD.
 My issue is that our users (about 500) have license for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, but only about half of the clients are running Business, the rest is stuck on Pro.
 Now, for some reason, it's exceptionally difficult to find any documentation on how this edition change actually works or should happen. Everything on MS, both on Learn and TechNet concerns Enterprise only, and even our CSP's licensing experts couldn't give a straight answer. (The first guy I spoke to, even claimed that there was no such thing as "Windows 10 Business"... o.O )
 Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a KMS key specifically for "Business", because if there was, I could just have the clients run a slmgr script silently, and that'd be the end of it -- and "just buy E3" (as another "expert" from our CSP suggested) is not en option either.
 Any insights, pointers or even encouraging comments are highly welcome and greatly appreciated.

Quick background, I started a new job a few months ago and was put in charge of building up a small mobile network with VMs, VoIPs, printers, WiFi, etc. I had a few people that came in and helped me put it all together. We had our first event recently and were complimented on how well everything ran. There were some issues to iron out but for the most part, it went really well. What would be the best way to thank them for their efforts? Keep in mind, they are not part of my organization, I am not a manager in anyway, I have no power to increase their salaries or get them a bonus. Thinking either taking them out to dinner or getting them each a small gift or something else. Any ideas on what would be good?

 I'm hoping someone can help me. I work in the education sector as a Network Admin and I'm looking to clear down user profiles en-masse using PDQ Deploy and Powershell but I'm running into a few problems.
 We have over 1000 students here all with roaming profiles and 400~ PCs, we are looking at getting rid of roaming at some stage but that's by the by.
 So, I tried the following scripts in Powershell:
 Get-ChildItem -path "C:\Users\*" -Exclude Default, Administrator | Remove-Item -Recurse -verbose 
 And simply:
 Remove-Item 'C:\Users\*' -Exclude Default, Administrator -Force -Recurse 
 The problem is, I'm getting an Unauthorized Access error. This happens despite running the script with elevated privileges, even locally.
 It has deleted the empty files and subfolders in each account, but leaving files like NTUSER.Dat and 'My Documents'.
 Would I need to run a script to take ownership/give modify access to all these folders beforehand? Or is there a better method for doing this?
 Thanks in advance.

 I am not too familiar with Solarwinds IPAM. I have used it in the past, but it was so slow that I ended using an excel sheet. I really need to start documenting my network for my team and I.
 This is something I am looking for:
  
IPAM can do multi-tenancy something like a tenant can login and can only view and edit their own IP block
 Can record circuits, etc
 Can record VMs, Containers, bare-metal servers
 Has a capability of documenting racks in the datacenter
 VLANs, VxLAN and VRF information
 Can detect overlapping IP or subnets
  
I have never used infoblox and can't really say much about it. At to this point, I need to provide my top 3 products that can be purchased so that it is suitable for enterprise environment. 
 Can you share the paid product you use and can it do a simple DCIM ?

 My understanding is that the LNS is usually a router. 
 My confusion is that it's common for the PPP L2TP traffic to be VLAN tagged. So you would need a switch to deal with this, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need your consultation.
 Let me briefly explain the topic I am working on:
 I work on the topic "satellite integrated terrestrial system" and am trying to understand what dynamic functional split and placement of RAN functions.
 I am a newbie and have never been working on these topics. Reading publications and attempting parallel to understand the basic concepts of the functional split, network slicing, and RAN are inefficient for me. I can spend 3-4 hours or more on one 4 pages-paper.
 Could you please help me with understanding the following questions:
  
What is a dynamic functional split? Does it mean that the placement of central(CU), distributed (DU) and radio units (RU) can be changed during transmission?
  
"dynamic" - process or system characterized by constant change, activity, or progress.
  
I have found a lot of publications where Open-Ran is proposed as a promising technology for satellite-integrated terrestrial networks. For a next-generation wireless system, we expect a huge amount of data and such an integrated system can help with overload. Why does Cloud Ran (CRAN) not suitable then?
  
CRAN can support up to hundreds of gigabit data rates cost-effectively without degrading the performance.

 We are a manufacturing and metalworking industry with about 400 employees thus having alot of machinery as well as office workplaces.
 We just had a site survey done and the results show that we need to roughly double the amount of APs that are currently in use if we wanted to use VoWIFI.
 That brought up some questions:
 1. What is your experience with VoWIFI?
 2. What is your experience with VOIP Apps on smartphones in daily use?
 2. In what cases would you use VoWIFI and in wich DECT?

As the mailbox probably is fairly old, it would be helpful if it was possible to only measure the last X months, otherwise time of employment would impact the stats.

 Single Domain, 25 users. Folder Redirection and Roaming Profiles. 
 The server was originally at the start, a 2003 SBS server and over the years has been migrated to new hardware with whatever version of Windows was current at the time. The intention is to put Server 2022 on the new Hardware. It's currently on 2012R2
 Given how many upgrades it's had, we are wondering about whether it would be better to create a new domain from scratch vs trying to do yet another upgrade. There seems to be legacy GPO's going back many many many years and we are a little worried that there is stuff in the system now that could be problematic. 
 Before anyone asks, yes they require an on-prem server for another cycle as their LOB application doesn't have a cloud equivalent for another 2 years at least. 
 One of the main issues is moving the profiles up and setting them up on the new domain etc.
 ​
 Interested in your thoughts on that.

We are slowly migrating client systems to Azure AD joined devices. There are a small handful of on-premise application/file servers remaining in the environment.
 With password hash sync, Users with expired passwords are allowed to access cloud resources normally. However, the rub begins where said user with Azure AD Joined system attempts to access an on-premise resource, which prompts for credentials (Because the password is expired). Simply wondering what the general guidance is to keep passwords synced back to on-premise AD for users logging into Azure AD Join systems. The on-premise AD Password policy matches the Azure Password policy.
 I was thinking about setting "EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers" from this article https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronizatio. Per this setting, the password would need to be changed on-prem first to initiate the enforcement process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, trying to keep this question as straight forward as possible. I have a client who will be leasing the left half of their large building and working in their right half. They’ll be keeping the ISP hand off in the same data room and will have a large fiber run from the left half to the right. Nothing on the left half of the building will be connected to their network. 
 What’s best practice? Putting the firewall on the ISP side or on the client side of the fiber run? 
 Note: They use unmanaged converters now but I suggested using switching with SPF so we can manage it better and see connection quality, etc. 
 Thanks in advance! This sub is always super helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all you smart people, kia ora from New Zealand! So we use an on premise version of ServiceDesk Plus (help desk tool) , and it integrates with Endpoint Central (endpoint management tool) they are both via Manage Engine, but looking around for alternatives. Our requirements are it needs to be ITIL centric and handle desktop management, remoting capability as well as handling change control, as well as the usual request /incident logging.
 For a user base of approx 1200 users.
 Anyone moved away from those products to others and have some experiences to share? (if you knew back then what you know now, post migration, would you have chosen another option etc?)
 Cloud is highly preferable for all the reasons.
 Thanks heaps in advance, I didn't realise how many options are out there now, and they all promise the world... But I'd like some real feedback from the coal face. (and not gonna lie, would love to learn from your mistakes/regrets, haha)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I took a new job mid last year. I like a lot about it, pays well. One if the things is we need to clean up a server environment. We're AWS but they have a local environment in HQ.
 It's an absolute mess. They hired me to run point and get it cleaned up along with being a Cloud Engineer.
 There are servers piled high with really resource intensive software. Some on the domain, some not. Nothing central. Easy to resolve. Basic stuff. But noone will hear me or they want to address 1000 things at once.
 There are these two dev servers just piled high. SQL, IIS, Visual Studio, and a huge swath of dev software. And they have developersiterally remoting in and working directly on the servers. Running massive processes in VS.
 I have told the CTO until Im blue in the face... Throwing more resources at these wint solve the issue. Well just keep adding resources. We need to split up some of it. SQL at the least.
 And he just isn't hearing my actual point. Saying things like, it's a lower env we can have sql and iis on one server. That's not my point....
 I got a request this morning and there are two ways to do it. One takes 15 steps, the other way takes 2. The easy way is modifying the config. I wasn't 100% sure which setting it was so... I sent an email asking, "Which setting in the configuration is x?" 
 This guy responds, "Yes, you can do it in the config." It's like no matter how I word it - he doesn't take my goddammit point and I'm about to put my foot through a window.
 Like I make this very well and clear point and he says, "Thanks for your inputs but its okay to have x y and z on a single server in a lower env.
 That was never my point. My point was - these vms are going to eat up every fucking thing you give them and well end up in a never ending loop of adding resources and you'll never remember that I said it would happen. Instead you'll just ask me, why does this keep happening? Like it's my fault.....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I never really thought I'd be making a post like this but that's only because I was too busy being an atta boy and not paying attention to the writing on the wall. 
 I'm a system admin over a very specific set of applications and systems. I've expressed my want to move outside of this role, however those conversations have been fruitless for the most part. I got an opportunity at another company for System Admin in a more traditional IT role. I spoke with my bosses today after telling them about the opportunity and I got the "what can we do to keep you" speech. 
 I feel like my biggest hurdle is my current boss. He knows half as much as I do, does 1/4 of the tickets I do, and delegates every.single.chance he gets. He's not a managing Sr, he's supposed to be a working Sr admin, which has been made abundantly clear to him via our chain several times, yet still there's next to no production from his office. I can't get a raise because then I'll make more than he does, and I can't get promoted because he doesn't have any place that'll take him, he has a bad work history within our department and is frankly lucky to even have a job at this point. 
 My question is...do I keep sticking around and trudging forward in the hopes that eventually the ice will break and I'll get a chance to move? Or do I just pick up my toys and go play someplace else where I can gain traditional IT experience that will go towards my resume if I choose to move again later on? I've been at my current company for 16 years, which makes it harder to just pack up and go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
 I am looking for help/suggestions on a cisco design topology. I have a project where I'm moving data between sites that are geographically distant. I want redundancy within this system that will be using cellular as its backbone.
 I have visited the locations and completed cellular audits of the signal, bandwidth, etc. Were happy with the speeds and it appears for the most part connectivity shouldn't be an issue. But we cannot have tons of reliability issues. So redundancy is important.
 I have IR1101 cellular routers at my disposal. I have attached a drawing to show this topology.
 My questions is:
 How do I steer traffic to use one cellular connection as primary and when this connection fails use the other cellular connection? Policy based routing? if so, can you expand on how this actually works and maybe link something I can gather more information on the config its self. I am a working Network engineer but I have not done this specific config before. Funny enough, cisco makes this 100x harder than all other manufactures. Also costs 4x. But I have the routers so that's what were running with.
 Key Notes:
 Cellular SIMs are Private static routable IPS. These are not accessible from anywhere outside of this Private subnet provided by carriers. Meaning The VZW sims can talk to one another, and the ATTs can. But not between the two carriers. In addition these SIMs cannot reach the internet. Internet cannot reach them. (this is a paid service from the providers)
 I am starting with simple site-to-site VPN tunnels. redundant setup. Tunnel 1 between VZW sims. Tunnel 2 ATT SIMs.
 With this setup, I figure all I need is to tell the router. "Hey always use VZW Cell interface, if it fails, go out ATT interface." Since both cellular connections are live, and they both have tunnels. The failover is simply switching the interface the traffic is going out.

 We were like many others in that the first update kinda broke things and we put in the entry to fix that issue. Then After the 2nd update we've added the auditing and we do see audit entries related to accounts that won't work after the final updates. 
 We're trying to get way ahead of this so we don't have as many issues by the time all is said and done and honestly we're really lost on how to handle this. We've been wondering if we need to automate the adjustment to all existing AD accounts and computer objects? Is this going to affect anything that makes an LDAP call instead of LDAPS? Are we overthinking it and it's actually not a big deal and it all works itself out through all of the updates? 
 We just don't quite understand everything that's happening related to these updates and we'd rather cause some little bumps to get everything ready early versus one massive downtime issue when Microsoft sends out the last update and enforces the new encryption types.

I have been working with TAC forever and 4500 switch tack blames firewall, firewall tac blames switch. Because of the way the firewall fails over and keeps the same IP address but on the other firewall makes me think there is something with ARP table that is not allowing the IP to change for that MAC address.

 ​
 After a long journey, I was able to regain control of six /24 IP blocks that my organization purchased back in 1992. I then put a few of these IP blocks to use, but have ran into a snag. Apparently, since these blocks have never been used on the outside internet, they were listed on the SPAMHAUS PBL. 
 The only information SPAMHAUS lists is the following:
  
Removal procedure 
 Removal of IP addresses within this range from the PBL is not allowed by the netblock owner's policy.
  
The bolded is frustrating as I am functionally the netblock owner, yet I see no option for submitting a removal request anywhere. 
 My idea is to put in a ticket with ARIN and with Lumen(whom is our ISP), but wanted to know if anyone else had any tips or ideas?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a customer report last week that they received an email from us requesting bank account details change. Normally I would put these down to the usual attempt but something is not right.
 Timeline:
 Email sent from genuine customer trying to make payment.
 Email returned to customer from a slightly different domain name with alternative bank details. It has correct email signature and some original text that one of my users has written.
 Customer queries with us and we realise what is happening and no payment is made.
 Provider contacted to block domain
 We use O365 and the user accounts have MFA. The password was poor for our user, so it has been changed to a new policy we are rolling out.
 Today it has happened again with a different customer and a different domain name - again very close to ours. They were going to make payment and the received a reply from a different domain but with text that looks like it came from us. One of the users involved is on holiday so I have disabled their login but this time a shared email account was spoofed. This account is disabled in AD by default (we are hybrid).
 Feels like we are being hacked somewhere. We are contacting our cyber insurance and I have requested the second domain be taken down. I have also reported to our email security/archiving company.
 Has anyone been affected this way before? What was the outcome?
 A worried thanks.

 But then I started thinking - after decades of the "older" generation being just. Pretty bad at operating their equipment generally, if the new crop of folks coming in end up being very, very bad at things and also needing constant help, that's going to be very, very depressing. I'm right in the middle as a millennial and do not look forward to kids half my age being like "what is a folder"
 But at least we can all hold hands throughout the generations and agree that we all hate printers until the heat death of the universe.

 On the PDCe of the Forest Root Domain (the one that sync outside) what flag should i use for the peer list ? 0x1 or 0x9 ?

 Is there a best practice for safely shutting these things down? I’ve got a monitor, keyboard, and mouse plugged into them. 
 Since anything that would be accessing the storage cluster is powered down, am I good to just shut windows down, starting with the second storage server?

 My manager wants to start using some form of MDM at our organisation, we haven't used it in the past as the number of users and devices was negligible, but we're at the point now where we need to start looking at implementing it. He is dead set on using Microsoft Intune/Endpoint Manager to do this. All our identity management is done via Azure AD. We essentially want to:
  
Allow users to log into any device using their Microsoft 365 account
 Deploy applications that the specific user is allowed to use, this should be able to be done on any device
 Push auto-updates, auto shutdown and remotely monitor devices
  
Is Intune/Endpoint Manager the ideal piece of software to do this? Are there any alternatives I could suggest even though my manager is dead set on it, as Intune/Endpoint Manager has so many features that we may not need? Also, are the requirements above feasible on Intune/Endpoint Manager?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In order to increase room on the network for our rapidly growing office (with many lab devices as well), we decided to split the wireless network into a separate VLAN/subnet. That's all well and good but our three printers (HP MFPs) are all Ethernet only. Our original subnet that remains ethernet based is 10.1.26.0 /24 and the new WLAN one is 10.1.29.0 /24. They are connected on the back end via our Cisco layer three switch and talk to each other fine. 
 People, when they're hard-wired, are able to print with no issue as before. However, I noticed that when on the new wireless network, they are having trouble reaching the printers that they have added on the other, hardwired based subnet with the drivers they have (though of course they can ping and access the web interface IPs fine). So far the solution is to remove those old drivers (added through the basic Microsoft 'add a printer' feature), go to the HP website and download/install the full official driver, skip past the step where it scans the network and can't find anything, and then manually input the IP address of the printer on the other subnet of 10.1.26.0. This then seems to work for both the wireless and ethernet subnets. But it is a few extra steps and a bit of work for the users, who sometimes may get confused or don't have time.
 Also, I noticed if you just use the basic Microsoft 'add a printer', 'can't find printer I'm looking for', 'manually enter the printer IP address', it just finds some generic or universal print driver that is not the most descriptive or useful, as it can't seem to find or offer an option for the actual precise driver.
 Anyway my main question is, is there a simpler way to do this, and advertise the printer easily and directly on both networks, or just make the existing printer installs on user machines work on both?
 Thanks.

What worries me is that I really don't know how have they done it. The SSH port that I'm using, which is not even the default (22), is only accesible through LAN and scanning it returns a closed port.
 Let me briefly describe my setup:
  
ISP router in bridge mode.
 Mini-pc running pfSense Community Edition v2.6.0.
 Synology NAS connected to pfSense.
  
​
 Pfsense config
  
upnp disabled.
 A few ports open for some of the NAS services, with the corresponding firewall rules.
  
​
 Synology NAS config
  
SSH is enabled and running on a port which is NOT open in pfsense. It is only accesible through LAN. I've tried accessing it through WAN and I can't.
 SFTP enabled and running on an open port accesible through WAN.
 WebDAV enabled and running on an open port accesible through WAN.
 Torrent client running on a docker container. The TCP port is fixed and upnp is disabled on the client.
  
Was this hacker exploiting a pfsense vulnerability? Or maybe a Synology's vulnerability? Or am I doing something wrong? Surprisingly, neither the SFTP nor the WebDAV had any intrusion.

 I would like to build some sort of GUI that my team can access through a regular browser that would run a powershell script using variables provided in the GUI and throws out the result. 
 For example I want to know which users are currently logged in on a Windows PC. I open the website
 search for "Check logged users in a Workstation", get linked to the right page where i can enter the PC name, click OK and get the list of users requested. 
 Do you guys know any good tool to achieve this? Or have any ideas on how you would approach this?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We have a class of 32 PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Version1809.
 Recently I've installed some software 'Autodesk Inventor 2023". Since then. on around 2/3 of the PCs the domain accounts take around 10-15 minutes to load up, and when it finally logs in comes up with the error shown in the photo on this page (Except 2023 rather than 2019)
 https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Warning-1909-Could-not-create-Shortcut-Inventor-Electrical-Project-2019-Ink.html
 "Warning 1909. Could not create Shortcut Inventor Electrical Project 2023.Ink" when launching Inventor
 Any ideas what I can try. So far I've tried fresh uninstall and reinstall.
 Tried these instructions
  
Navigate to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk.
 Locate the folder labeled Inventor Electrical Library 2023.
 Right-click and select properties.
 Clear the Read-Only attributes at the bottom of the box and Apply. 
  
Also tried the master folder and subfolder and gave all users full access to read and write and modify where this shortcut is supposed to possibly be.
 I've also turned off Controlled folder access too via Windows Security. Local admin and network admin both log on.
 Not sure what else to try. Only thing I can think of is that the user domain accounts connect to a network drive and they can't access their C:// drives (except admin). But obviously reads all the program data from the C drive.
 I'm baffled why it doesn't happen on every single one though.
 ​
 Any tips for me to try?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to help advise a friend, and would really value some guidance on how best to approach.
 This is a commercial space, with a suspended ceiling (concrete, with a 1-1.5m gap, then metal grid with gyprock). Here are some photos:
 https://i.imgur.com/u7NDv7G.jpg
 https://i.imgur.com/ethejqo.jpg
 https://i.imgur.com/HdHXRJp.jpg
 I noticed a few things with the existing cabling that seemed a bit strange.
  
Most of the cable is loose-laid over the ceiling grid.
 Some cables is zip-tied to threaded rods, that are used for the HVAC ducting (which I assume is somewhat better, right?).
 Several open plastic takeaway containers of liquid - not sure what it is? Maybe leaks?
 Several pieces of old clothing/rags up there - I assume from construction, or somebody left their overalls?
 Exposed electrical wiring
  
Firstly, does anybody know of any photos of a *good* data cabling setup in a suspended ceiling? (So I can show them what it should ideally look like).
 The closest I could find are these - but they don't really show the final complete setup:
 https://i.imgur.com/pRtuEgN.jpg (Source)
 https://i.imgur.com/DhnwC2P.png (Source / Source)
 Secondly, what's a way to describe to a non-technical person, why the above are issues? Or why it might cause issues when they try to add new cabling etc?

 The difference with me is that I have a mishmash environment. Two domain controllers - 2003 and 2008. The domain level is set to 2003. From 2003 I can not migrate to 2022 directly. But from 2008 already yes? I can't find anywhere if after demote old DC 2003 and then upgrading the domain to 2008 I will be able to migrate directly to 2022. Only there is information about the R2 version. On File Services I have option to install Distributed File System and DFS Namespaces, DFS Replication.
 The next question is about the ip number of the new domain controller. I would like to leave the old ip number. That way I wouldn't have to change the dns number anywhere.

 I need to upgrade a cluster from vSphere 6.7 to 7.0. The VCSA is already on 7.0. HA is currently activated.
 ​
 What is the best order for the upgrade? Would you attach the new ISO baseline to one host, then to the next one, etc. or to the cluster and remediate one after the other?
 ​
 Would you fully disable HA, or only do maintenance of single hosts?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We have had a long running issue regarding Sophos XG Firewall. Users who log in to their laptops have access to the internet, and then when some lock their computers and come back to it, the heartbeats aren't sent to the firewall and they're blocked from accessing the internet until they restart the laptop.
 We have a 3rd party who provide the equipment for us and "manages" them, and we've been on at them for 18 months about this issue. Their response tends to be to run a piece of software that pulls the logs from the machine which is then sent to Sophos. We've done this for so long with no real solution to the issue. I get the feeling the issue is with Sophos as they don't know (or care) why this is happening, so things are just stuck.
 I've been asked by my boss to find an alternative to Sophos XG Firewall, as a number of users are losing chunks of the day from having to restart their computers to get back on to the internet. The firewall must be user aware, so that we can apply specific rules to these users. 
 Can anyone suggest an alternative? One with good support would be advantageous.

 With this out the way, periodically (always during core business hours) we have really bad network performance, dropping packets from site to external, from site to data centre. But performance inside the data centre to internal devices is fine which leads me to believe that something on site is doing something to an external entity. 
 To give you some idea, we have site connected to a data centre via fibre and then from that data centre firewall out to the internet. 
 I don't even know really where to begin with this, the only evidence of the issue is poor network performance, packets being dropped to servers in the DC and to the internet. Im hoping to be able to at least figure out where the traffic is being sent to and or from and from ether i can then figure out what and why and ultimately how to deal with this. 
 I apologise if this is not the kind of post you folks accept here.

I am fairly new at my job where we mostly cater to Enterprise Customers - I have been supporting SMB customers in my previous job for the last 7 years - I am quite overwhelmed by some of the discussions and I am making efforts to really study especially the fundamentals to have a good understanding.. I'd like to take some advice from the people here in terms of what would be a good start in learning Network Design Fundamentals? Enterprise Networking to be specific, are there recommended trainings in Udemy, Linkedin, etc. that discuss Network Design and how to build a good and reliable design and understand its data flow as well. 
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am aware that a network professional should plan a site and choose appliances and brands depending on several factors, such as:
  
Reputation and Reliability: A brand with a good reputation for quality and reliability is likely to be preferred by a network engineer. This is because they need to ensure that the network is up and running smoothly at all times, and any downtime or failure could result in significant losses for the organization.
 Compatibility and Integration: A network engineer may choose a brand that integrates well with other devices already in use in the network. This can simplify network management and reduce the likelihood of compatibility issues.
 Features and Functionality: Different brands offer different features and functionality, and a network engineer may choose a brand based on the specific needs of their organization. For example, a brand that offers advanced security features may be preferred for a network that handles sensitive data.
 Cost: The cost of networking devices can vary significantly between brands, and a network engineer may need to balance the cost with the needs of the organization. In some cases, a more expensive brand may be preferred if it offers better performance or reliability, while in other cases, a more affordable brand may be preferred if cost is a primary concern.
  
Having said so, for our next school site (900 users) we could opt to continue using Ubiquiti devices which have an overall good price to performance and reliability ratio. However, within the community, there are several experts who keep on snubbing Ubiquiti as if it were an unreliable or less-enterprise grade devices.
 Given the the above brands, and the above thoughts, if you were asked "Ubiquiti, why yes and why no", how would you reply? What is Ubiquiti missing compared to the other two brands, apart from a poor support, which is essentially community based?

 What does everyone use for their "what's your computer name script"
 I have used BG info in the past, but users don't like it. Rainmeter was used in a past life but that was configured by the company that built the SOE at the time and looked way to complicated
 Looking for something easy. EG they double click on it, pops up a html page with the info. EG Computername, IP address etc
 ​
 Before we would stick a sticker and choose the name in SCCM during the build.
 But now with Intune and Autopilot you can't do it and we can't be bothered changing it in Intune as we would have to login to the computer etc. and that's annoying and broke Azure AD once on the machine. I don't mind if they are random but want to be able to get the name easy for the end user so we can connect using Spalshtop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says. I am trying to build a route-based VPN between an ASA and a NSX-V. If this might be better suited for r/cisco then feel free to let me know. The ASA 5515 is current NAT'd behind another firewall. Ports 4500, 500, and 50 are DNAT'd to the ASA. This is where my knowledge of networking starts to fizzle out as I believe a lot of the issues I am running into are because of NAT-T and potential limitations I might not know of or how to get around
 The NSX-V is connected directly with a public IP. I am connecting the on-site ASA to the cloud hosts NSX-V. In the snippets below the 216. is the NSX-V and the 10. is the ASA. All Phase 1 settings match and what is interesting is that if make a change to the tunnel on the NSX-V and save (like disabling and re-enabling PFS) the tunnel acts like it comes up on port 500.
  6 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 302015 10.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 216.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 Built outbound UDP connection 9147 for Outbound:216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) to identity:10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) 
 However after about ~30s I get this error and the tunnel continues to loop on port 4500
 4 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 750003 Local:10.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Remote:216.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Username:216.xxx.xxx.xxx IKEv2 Negotiation aborted due to ERROR: Auth exchange failed 
 I saw in this VMware article that states potential issues with NSX-T and IPsec with NAT-T. So I would assume that same behavior is to be expected with NSX-V. I configured the NSX-V to only be a IKE Responder so that only the ASA would initiate the tunnel but I havent seen any change in outcome. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77288
 As a test I tried to build a policy-based IPsec tunnel to a USG I get somewhat similar behavior where Phase 1 completed however after that the tunnel is torn down and the reason being User-Requested. 
 Just a little stumped, if anyone wants to toss some knowledge into my beggars cup. It would be much appreciated :)

 I have recently been bumped into an Admin role and I'm still learning while working. 
 Our department will start a rollout project where the team needs to replicate the AD group memberships of one device(lets call it OLD) to another(NEW device).
 As the rollout team will be replacing an OLD device and provide the End User with a NEW one, they want to mass replicate the memberships as they will be targeting to replace about 15-20 devices a day. 
 I currently have a PowerShell Script that can perform this task but can only do 1-1. I also tried making a script(using google) that can perform this task but for bulk using a csv but I have not succeeded yet. 
 Could anyone please help me with this or tell me about a solution that they use regarding this task?

 Where I live (Brasil), we do have few options when it comes to good equipments and fair prices. Mainly white box ones, being QuantaMesh and Arista the closest (EdgeCore models available are not ONIE compatible, so ...).
 So, for our case, based on price capabilities, we have the following models to be purchased :
  
Arista 7050QX-32
 QuantaMesh T1048-LB9A
 Nexus 2048T
 Nexus 3000 (3048TP) and 5000 (5596T)
  
The preference is for white box switches, and only Arista fits that requirement (we're evaluating SONiC and Stratum primarily). QuantaMesh has models that does, but 10048-LB9A seems to not be compliant and doesn't support ONIE.

 I have been asked to design a new super duper infrastructure fit for the business needs - great that's something interesting to sink my teeth into.
 ....to then be told OTR that no matter how good my design is that this project will be farmed out to a consultancy to do the design for us - seems like a great use of my time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, looking for advice on if this will work
 Have a public website with domain, currently using two nameservers at the registrar.
 Those NS's are hosted by the same company, and if that company has an outage, none of my (A), (CNAME), (TXT) or (SRV) records are going to resolve.
 My thought is to setup a Hurricane Electric free DNS account at and add just two of their name servers as the third and fourth entry:
 ns1.he.net
 ns2.he.net
 T so if a lookup is made for any of the records during an outage of the first two NS, it will (FAIL), (FAIL), (RESOLVE he.net DNS).
 Now I don't mind keeping the two DNS server entries up to date manually, there are like 10-15 records in total. But does anyone see any issue doing this that I am not thinking about?

 I happen to get my hands on an "old" Linkrunner Pro, which theoretically has the ability to generate Reports on a PC. However it requires the Software "Linkrunner Connect" which was supplied via CD-Rom- which after all those years- is lost by the previous owner.

 Do you guys have any hints, on how to connect? Will the newer LinkWare connect with this device,?

 We finally configured DMARC for our domain about a week ago. Everything was functioning fine, reports were coming in correctly, and then we decided to change the email we were receiving reports at to better filter them. Since then, emails to some domains (not all) are bouncing with "554 5.7.5 Permanent error evaluating DMARC policy". 
 All our records are checking correctly with spf/dkim/dmarc checkers, and all the records have propagated out correctly.
 DNS host says check with your email provider (Google), Google says "your records look fine, turn off DMARC or reach out to every domain you're getting that error from and ask their IT to add you to a whitelist"
 Is that the answer? Are we doing DMARC wrong? Our current record is just "v=DMARC1;p=none;rua=mailto:dmarc@ourdomain.com", still getting bounces.

 To this point the Network Administrator has had the responsibility of purchasing and managing the SSL certificates on the Internet domain registrar. No issue there.
 Previously, the Network Administrator stood up the base server, and the WebDev installed the Internet Web service. The Network Admin would download the appropriate Cert and private key and make it available to WebDev
 New people have come onboard as WebDev, and they seem to have the attitude that it is the Network Administrator's job to maintain the certs on the various servers.
 QUESTION: Whose responsibility is it to install and maintain the certificates on the Internet Web servers? 
 A) Is is WebDev that installed and programmed the web server, or is it the
 B) Network Administrator who has been purchasing and managing the SSL certificates on the Internet domain registrar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a reorganization of a relatively small data center into something resembling a decently designed, modular network. It's of a size where it doesn't need anything more than a collapsed core with ToR switches acting as a access. It's going to be L2 access for now because of equipment availability. Also because of its small size, I'm not doing any overlay networking.
 However, some of the hosts are VMhosts like ESXi and it occurs to me that they have their, virtual switches internally. Other than providing basic VLAN infrastructure, they aren't doing anything in terms of service provisioning, port density is a nonsensical concept for a vSwitch, and any interconnect to physical switches is, at most, going to be doing basic trunking/tagging.
 So, how do these fit into the outline of the infrastructure? I'm trying to get this design to be scalable -- small right, but possible to grow and evolve without major rip and replace of the whole thing rather than piece by piece over the years -- and data center networking is something I'm not deeply familiar with. Do you just ignore their presence, beyond ensuring there is no possibility of them causing L2 issues?

 For my main controller, I'm running an Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro at 192.168.1.1. I have a few other subnets off of that, but this one for this switch is 192.168.4.0/24.
 I set the ip address of the switch as 192.168.4.2 255.255.255.0
 I set the default router of the switch to 192.168.4.1
 I then setup the dhcp-server pool...
 ip dhcp-server enable ip dhcp-server pool home network 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 excluded address 192.168.4.1 192.168.4.10 excluded address 192.168.4.100 192.168.4.254 dhcp-default-router 192.168.4.2 dns-server 192.168.1.1 lease 1 0 0 deploy 
 After setting this, I can run `show ip dhcp-server address-pools` and it shows me the correct configuration and that I have one active lease for the dhcp server pool, but for whatever reason either i'm missing something from here or i've done something wrong that just above my scope of knowledge. Either way, i'm looking for help. 
 Anything you can contribute I would greatly appreciate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2020 lockdowns we got fairly settled with a remote working configuration that involves our remote team using RDP on a thin client of sorts, remotely controlling a remote Windows 11 Pro workstation (via a VPN). We then either use a work smartphone for VOIP calls, or using remote audio redirection via RDP. Remote audio redirection works OK if latency is low (under 30ms), but we now have someone who has over 150ms ping to their remote workstation. Unfortunately this causes VOIP calls to have a LOT of lag (probably about 1000ms latency or more) and is generally not great. Before I send out another smartphone, I wanted to do a little bit of digging to see if there are better remote audio solutions available.
 When doing some research I found that some people were experimenting with to passing through a USB audio device, but I can't seem to find a way to do this on a Windows 11 Pro workstation - I enabled the group policy option for RemoteFX USB passthrough on my client PC but I still can't seem to find this as an option.
 Other people have suggested installing VOIP software on the local machine - but having to flip flop between the local and remote environment sounds really annoying.
 The last thing I've discovered is a tool called sound-over-rdp, but I can't seem to find any feedback as to whether it's a good tool or not. It also is a little bit on the expensive side of things, would rather not drop nearly $3k AUD for 5 users / servers.
 I did also find an open source project called USBIP-Win that allows for USB redirection, but it seems pretty complex. I had a quick look at their github and I'm not quite sure it'd solve my issue to be honest.
 Any suggestions on the best practices from here would be greatly appreciated!

 I have 1 email address linked to a custom domain. The domain is hosted on name.com, and the email is hosted via Microsoft365
 I'm able to send and receive mail from within my outlook client just fine.
 I followed the "Enabling DKIM" guide from learn.microsoft on the following link:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dkim-configure?view=o365-worldwide
 Additionally, I also followed the github guide on https://github.com/duocircle/Office365-Setup-DKIM-DMARC-SPF
 By following the guides, I added 2 DNS records for my custom domain, and waited 24h to verify this in the dashboard. After 24h the verification succeeded, and the tool at https://security.microsoft.com/dkimv2 reported that DKIM was set up successfully. 
 However, 48h later, messages received from this email address still report 
 dkim=fail (no key for signature) 
 In the header.
 SPF and ARC are both reported as pass.
 I tried to verify the DKIM records via an external tool (https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=dkim), which reports:
  No DKIM Record found 
 Could it be that I need to publish another TXT record with the shape?
 v=DKIM1; p=76E629F05F70 9EF665853333 EEC3F5ADE69A 2362BECE4065 8267AB2FC3CB 6CBE 
 And if so, does anyone know where to get this kind of information?
 I'm out of ideas on what to try, to make the DKIM check succeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wonder if there is a way to enforce a condition through GPO that if someone want to join PC to domain without Mcafee app being installed in the targeted PC it will prevent them from joining them to domain it's like assessment checking if the application exist then it can be joined to domain.
 Other ways AFAIK deploying through SCCM, but I wonder if there are assessment check or conditions before joining to domain or am just dreaming. 
 This task should be performed by our Helpdesk support team but sometimes they tend to forget to install the application manually in the targeted PC. 
 Your insight is much appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, 
 I’ve got this odd issue the with the VMware sdwan / Velocloud Edge 510-LTE. I have about 150 and randomly they drop their LTE interface. It’s just not there. The debug thinks so too. A reboot doesn’t fix, firmware upgrade doesn’t fix. I have to pull the power for a bit and reconnect to resolve. Across my fleet I’ve got usually about 5 with this issue. The SP can’t work it out and VMware’s reply is it’s not a priority so they get to it one day.
 Curious if anyone seen this ? I though initially heat related but I’ve demonstrated it’s isn’t. 
 Cheers 
 Matt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you rename a user account in Microsoft 365 (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/change-a-user-name-and-email-address?view=o365-worldwide), there seems to be some consistency problems for the end user and their local device profile, even if you rename their profile, or disconnect their device from the AzureAD domain and rejoin the AzureAD domain. 
 Example: I rename Ben Dover to June Doe.
 When the user logins in to their existing Windows device (AzureAD joined) with their new email address (ben.dover@domayn.co), the first thing Windows does is show a their old name (Ben Dover). Then if they click on the Start button, their profle icon (for Sign Out, Lock etc), shows their old name too.
 Even if you rename their user profile folder and the relevant registry key (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/user-profiles-and-logon/renaming-user-account-not-change-profile-path) the same symtons exist. 
 Anyone else experiencing this and know a way to resolve it?

 The cost of doing upgrades don't go away if you ignore them, they accumulate... with interest
 In terms of document management, all roads eventually lead to Sharepoint... and nobody likes Sharepoint
 The Sunk Costs Fallacy is a real thing, sometimes the best and most cost effective way to fix a broken solution is to start over.
 Making your own application in house to "save a few bucks on licensing" is a sure fire way to cost your company a lot more than just buying the damn software in the long run. If anyone mentions they can do it in MS access, run.
 Backup everything, even things that seem insignificant. Backups will save your ass
 When it comes to Virtualization your storage is the one thing that you should never cheap out on... and since it's usually the most expensive part it becomes the first thing customers will try to cheap out on.
 There is no shortage of qualified IT people, there is a shortage of companies willing to pay what they are worth.
 If there's a will, there's a way to OpEx it
 The guy on the team that management doesn't like that's always warning that "Volcano Day is coming" is usually right
 No one in the industry really knows what they are doing, our industry is only a few decades old. Their are IT people about to retire today that were 18-20 when the Apple iie was a new thing. The practical internet is only around 25 years old. We're all just making this up as we go, and it's no wonder everything we work with is crap. We haven't had enough time yet to make any of this work properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had an old windows 2012 physical production server failed a few weeks ago. We had DB and file backups for that server. So, we ended up rebuilding the server from the backups. But it still caused a lot of impact, like almost 2 days of production down, and missing a few days of data. 
 After that incident, the boss ordered us to convert all physical servers to Virtual server. We still have a handful of old physical 2012 mission critical running. We use hyper-v for our VMs. Converting is easy, but expecting doing it on the weekend to minimize business downtime. We don't have a lifecycle for servers, if they are not EOl and still running, we just let them run.
 Most of those physical servers are old ,I think a better approach is creating new server and letting the application owner migrate the data out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 laptop (Win11 Home) that recently had its motherboard replaced through repair. There was no option for me to suspend Bitlocker as the Windows I have doesn't feature that and my laptop stopped working, so I didn't prepare for that situation.
 Right now, every time I boot my computer, I am asked to input my Bitlocker recovery key, which is an inconvenience (I have the key backed up). I haven't been able to find solutions that match with this situation as most posts online focus on non-repair related issues.
 The Lenovo technician told me this: It's because the serial number on the motherboard doesn't match with the rest of the laptop. He suggested me that I should reinstall Windows 11, but because it was active when I booted post-repair, I don't think this would work.
 I also found out that there's a BIOS update, along with some other Windows updates that were there for the three weeks I didn't have access to the laptop. But given that the situation I'm in with the Bitlocker Recovery Key is due to a repair and not a software issue, how should I go about this?
 Thank you in advanced for advice! :)

 ​
 If you are using an account that is a part of the Protected users group in AD, that account will not work. You will receive an error stating that vSphere cannot contact the LDAP server along with an invalid credentials error. I assure you, there is no connection issue. This is likely the issue. I would suggest creating a separate account and make sure that it is not a part of the Protected users group. This should fix the issue and allow you to connect through LDAP.

Say I walk away and the surface goes to sleep it does the same thing after waking back up and reestablishing the connection. I have a shit ton of stuff up on my desktop so I figured that has something to do with it. If I reboot the work pc it won’t do it for a bit but that’s super annoying with all the stuff I have open. 
 Here’s the weird part - today I was trying on my girlfriends MacBook and the connection was flawless. Soon as I connected it doesn’t even flash once and I can move around the system within seconds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Config consists of a MX-01 that has bridge domains for layer 2 connectivity for directly connected devices. MX-01 has an Extended-Vlan-bridge to another MX-02 that has Vlan-vpls encapsulation with the interfaces directly associated to the VPLS routing instance. Which then this VPLS Instance extends the VLANs to the remote sites. MX-02 is a iBGP RR with dynamic tunnels to 10 other sites to create a full mesh. The issue that seems to be happening is the BD is re advertising learned MACs from the remote VPLS sites as its own. Indicating the wrong LSI reachability. And also randomly creating loops with the MAC addresses.
 Is this just the nature of the beast in this setup? Or is there a way to prevent VPLS from readvertising learned mac's across the LSI's? Or would EVPN be a better fit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use gateway redundancy on Juniper MX routers based on EVPN, bridge-domains, IRBs with same IP/MAC and ESI-LAG to switches. I have a deployment where it has worked flawlessly for several months already. Some time ago I tried to deploy same design to other site that has several times higher MAC/IP count, specifically around 5k MACs and 30k IPs across many vlans. First problem I ran into, was per-interface MAC and MAC+IP limit in bridge-domains. I figured out how to increase those limits and decided to try again. To better describe what the config looks like, at the bottom of the text there is example of config. The configuration of second router is similar. I did not include BGP with family evpn but EVPN signaling works fine, I checked that by elected designated-forwarder on both routers.

That is working perfectly fine and everything works as expected. I’d like to enable that for everyone but unless I’m reading the documentation wrong Microsoft seems to have the end state being the decommissioning of the ADFS server. We still need ADFS for a number of legacy apps but just want to take 365 out. Is there any way to do this other than populating my staged rollout group with the entire company?

 This is barely above minimum wage in the UK. I hope they struggle to hire someone for this role as that's an absolute pisstake salary. It's crazy being in this community and seeing the salaries of our American counterparts and here in the UK, the pay for IT jobs seem to be getting stomped down regularly for some reason. "Urgently needed" as well, what a joke!

 I have been working as an sysadmin for 6-7 years and have always been dumbfounded that we have 4-5 WSUS servers, one for each of our customers VM environments that we host. I was told when I started that this was best practice when it was setup but seems like a big fat lie.
 My questions is as follows:
 1) Is it even possible to have 1 WSUS for all the servers for a more seamless environment or is it really best practice how it's setup today. Seems like allot of wasted space.
 2) Would the WSUS server need to be on a domain?
 3) Does anyone have any tips what to do?
 Thanks in advance! 👍

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is more a topic of curiosity than just hating on the cloud. I myself and very wary of the majority of computing being consolidated to a handful of major cloud providers. I know we here are not going to change the world as decision makers greater than us are driving this change.
 What am I curious is if any company of substantial size reversed their cloud journey. Move thing back to a data center when smart like VMs infrastructure. If so, what drove that reason? 
 My biggest gripe about cloud is the constant flux of change. It is almost impossible to mature what we are doing when the tech evolves rapidly every two years now. Half of Azure features always have a “Preview” tag on it. For me, the lack of stability would be my reason to not become a cloud first company. Not ignore it, but not see it as the answer to all my problems.

 I've got myself stuck trying to work out how much of our 1Gbps uplinks between switches are being utilised. Our monitoring pulls back input bandwidth and output bandwidth, and our uplinks are fibre with 1Gb SFPs.
 So if the output bandwidth is 100Mbps and the input bandwidth is 100Mbps, then the total bandwidth would be 200Mbps. But because it's a fibre pair how does one affect the other? Is there 1Gbps up and down simultaneously or is the bandwidth limited by the SFP?
 Any pointers gratefully received.

 My buddy said that's a security risk. I am aware of the practice of hiding data inside of images...but if I really wanted to do that I could probably find a way to do that. 
 Personally, I've found those background images to help me especially when your having a bad day.

 So I’ve got a upcoming task at work this week. I need to replace 3 x old APC UPS Units with 3 x new APC UPS Units. I’ve never done something like this before, but it can’t be that difficult, right?
 I’m planning to do this out of hours. I’m thinking, first of all, shut all infrastructure down properly - this includes: 
 Sophos Firewall, User/Server Switches, Physical Servers, Physical Workstations, QNAP NAS Devices, ESXi hosts, Equallogic SANs. 
 Then, power off the current UPS units and unmount them one by one from racks. Remove one old and replace with one new. Connect all power cables as they were before, and power up the UPS’s. 
 Then just a case of confirming everything is back online and working as expected.
 Am I missing something? Anything important to keep in mind with this sort of task?
 I’m excited because these new UPS’s we’ve bought have NICs, so we can setup monitoring/alerts and check on them (if needed) remotely.
 Thanks!

Doing so deletes encryption keys from Chrome's "Local State" file, similar to changing a password, and Chrome lost the saved passwords. When the user logs in from the migrated profile, Local State's encryption key is replaced, so tools like Chromepass don't work, as it tries to use the new Local State encryption key. They didn't login to Google to backup.
 I know the password from the old environment\profile, but switching the profile back still assigns a different SID. Am I screwed without the Local State file? Is there at least a way to find the encryption key? I can then add that to the Local State file and then use the user's password to decrypt it.

 Did anyone here ever use it? If so: why? What are the benefits? What are the ways to use it. I am not talking about the vPro/AMT extensions; just raw IME.
 Edit: Just saw that I forget the word "Engine" in the title. Oh well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple years ago, the company I was working for was acquired by a much larger corporation. They never said my job was safe, but the people I was working with reassured me my job was going to be safe. Long story short, after a year, I completed a ton of migration work (pretty much everything) but immediately after I was sent on my way. (I don't hold a grudge against them, I get it, they had teams to do what I was doing by myself.) I did all the sysadmin work and the netadmin work. We would hit up a trusted MSP if I didn't know what to do with the networking side of things. 
 Before the acquisition I was doing everything outside of ERP work. I've been in the sysadmin role for over a decade. Anything Windows that you throw at me I'm fine with... Some linux i'm ok with. I'm pretty good with configuring network equipment, not super advanced. But I'm comfortable with configuring switches and firewalls. Not an expert, but I can work my way around it. 
 When recruiters hit me up, about 75% of them want some intro level NOC role. Others are trying for a senior networking role. I don't think I'm ready for a senior networking role right now, but I think I could be ready within a couple months if given the opportunity. 
 Sorry, I'm kinda rambling because I've had a few beers and I don't know what to do.
 I've had multiple interviews. I've made it known what I'm looking for compensation wise. So I don't know if I'm outpricing myself. But I've never even been lowballed with an offer. 
 I've gotten interviews but not for every job I've applied for, so maybe my resume is garbage? I just don't know what to do.

 WIFI access points are for now designed to be in corridors instead that in classrooms! See a frame captured from the building plan: https://i.ibb.co/BghXC0F/Screenshot-79.png
 Don't you think this is a bad WIFI design? Can those APs satisfy network requests once the school will run 1:1 devices in each classroom? Will high density APs be required? Walls are basically plasterboard partitions....

I took up a new job at a company that sells ERP systems and I have been tasked with securing the client's servers. Luckily and kinda unluckily too we run the system on windows servers.
 My superiors are currently adamant on keeping RDP open when the server is public facing so as to make any configuration changes remotely. I suggested to him that this is a very insecure method of operating and that is when he tasked me with coming up with a solution for it.
 Upon some research I came across the following:
  
Change the RDP port to a port outside the well-known ports range. This is cool, but it doesnt solve the problem since the port …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 So I have a scenario that I’d like some advice on. I have an HP enterprise blade server with a single NIC in it that has two ports. It’s runner Windows Server 2019 with a Hyper V instance that I’d like to Run Untangle on. Now the question is, can I use one port on the NIC as Hyper V’s WAN and the second as a LAN for the internal network that would then be handled by Untangle, or should I just create a scope within Win Server to issue IP’s Via DHCP on the NIC’s second port, or is any of this even possible because I have never attempted it myself. I understand it’s an odd request and it’s more for a Proof of Concept rather than production, but I’m trying to prove a point to a manager that took one network class and now believes themselves and expert. 
 I’m in essence trying to create a network on this blade while getting a DHCP assigned address from the actual production network at work. Running that traffic through untangle to a layer 3 switch/router then out to two Layer 2 switches that will then assign addresses to plugged in devices. It’s a mess admittedly but again this is a proof of concept. 
 I thank anyone who has advice or comments in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to what I know, lower metrics are preferred, but in this case, we have two vEdges routers (MPLS and Internet routers) that are both advertising default routing by using the command "default-info originate," in OSPF.
 The current problem is that the client claims that there are subnet traversing to MPLS routers, which are meant to traverse through the Internet to reach public servers. Upon checking the configuration. The MPLS metric is set to 50 and the Internet to 1, respectively. Internet should be preferred based on the metric they have. Another thing, there is only one point-to-point connection between each router and the core switch, I am unable to access or control those core switches. (refer to the diagram w/ issue)
 https://ibb.co/hRsGv29
 I've now tried setting the MPLS value to 1 and the Inet value to 50, and apparently they claim it works. Do you believe that this is possible, particularly in multi-homed connections? (refer to the diagram FIXED)
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Wondering what the consensus is with regards to versions of Apache and/or Tomcat that come via a Vendor supplied app or package. That is, software x comes as a product but underneath the hood, it's all driven by an Apache backend. Are you handling updates to Apache outside of the vendor or are you having to lean on the vendor to supply an entire new package with inevitably already out of date versions of these packages?
