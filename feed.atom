        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can I use the Sophos XGS 87 for 35-40 users (actual users might be around 30 only but I am increasing the number futurewise) all the users are basically light internet users (2 users heavily focused on downloading backups from servers which needs bandwith) I have a fiber line of 100Mbps.
 My question was basically that does the firewall software limit users to 20 or is it unlimited but the company advertises it as 20 for declared performance? ( even if performance drops with more users it would not affect my 100Mbps right??)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you go about preparing systems, if they involve accounts that use an Authenticator app?
 We often set up new systems with all fine details and settings on our own, which are then shipped to the end user so that they can get right back to work with their new system.
 In the past the users gave us their current passwords once and changed it after the work was done. 
 Now Microsoft 365 requires a 2FA on the basis of an authentication app (Microsoft or third-party), which means that we have to go to the user every time we need to sign in, so that they can give us the necessary PINs. 
 Since Microsoft 365 requires a new login quite frequently during setup, it can then happen that we have to keep pestering the users over 1-3 days, our work gets held up if we can't reach them, etc.
 Have you found a solution and a reasonable workflow for this?

 There are still two 2008R2 in use, which I want to migrate to 2022 with the Storage Migration Service.
 This does not work because the Powershell version is too low. So I have to install the Windows Management Framework first. As soon as I install the update and then restart the server, the update fails and is undone. In the event logs I get the error code 80070661 and I can't find a solution on the net.
 Could it be because we don't have Extended Security Updates for 2008R2 servers? 
 Do you have any other idea how I can solve this problem?

 On Exchange online you can just turn it on and off manually. Idea is that i want to make it less of a chore and automate this. For example turn on forwarding emails from user1 to user2 from datetime1 to datetime2.
 Idea is to use scheduler on server and run two scripts. One for turning on and one for turning off. Maybe some kind of gui that create two scripts base on use input and after the second script run, both tasks are deleted?
 Any idea how to proceed with this?

 opensource is fine, also payed but it needs to be some kind of trial so i can test it and show it off to the rest of the staff.

 We've got a BGP with our Plubic AS peering with two Tier 1 providers. (Telia and Cogent)
 The issue I'm having is that customers using Zayo here in the US are getting latency over 40ms. We're based in NYC and our traffic is routed to Atlanta via Zayo, if I use the Zayo looking glass to find our IP, I can confirm it's going to Atlanta. Neither of my ISPs can do anything about it.
 I tried reporting Zayo, but no luck. When I ping my office using Altice, the time is fine, but if I ping a Zayo customer or vice versa, it's not. Both providers give me the default route.
 Do you guys have any ideas on what to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay im trying to downgrade the firmware on my 7841 cisco ip phones. All I have to work with is a laptop and single router, a pacstar 447 and no Internet. I copied the firmware from a USB to the routers flash, I then configured dhcp. Cme and sip, a voice vlan and interfaces. I configured the port the phone is connecting to as a trunk because it wasn't letting me ping the phone unless I did so. When I look in the phones settings it shows it has an ip given from the dhcp I set up, it shows the tftp server ip that I set on the router and it shows the routers domain name and hostname, and the routers ip, it shows that there is no codec on the phone and in the status when I reboot or factory reset the phone it shows dns no ip, so I tried configuring that but it still doesn't show up. And when I do the upgrade command or create profile command is says error deleted flash:/ then some weird file name that doesn't exist on the router. My supervisor said not to worry about it. Any ideas of what I could be missing? Also before I made it a trunk port the phone would say tftp timed out but now it has the dns thing which confuses me because we're not trying to pull anything from a dns and we have all it needs on the router.

Regulations require holding onto stuff for a long time, and as I inherited it, and it was working, I left it alone. I started down the Veeam Backup path about 3 years ago as a more rich feature set, as well as a secondary backup system. Just got my Barracuda renewal quote and its a 200% rate increase. Its seriously making me consider that its time to throw in the towel and walk away. Anyone have experience trying to get legacy info out of Barracudas and imported into Veeam? Only idea I have at the minute is to restore the yearlies as a VM, then have Veeam back that up. Just take a point in time from every year. Thanks in advance.

 I’ve been tasked with the seemingly impossible job of trying to figure out how to make the Unitrends backup system meet the needs of our company. 
 In the 3 years we’ve been with Unitrends our situation has gone from bad to worse to where I’m spending majority of my day chasing backups and monitoring ‘round the clock because I can’t take my eyes off the system least I want to spend the next day or two rebooting appliances, stopping/starting tasker, re-syncing assets, etc.
 It’s like pulling teeth trying to get my tickets escalated. They’re putting most of their KB’s behind a pay wall! 
 I’m at my wits end trying to make lemonade out of this lemon. I’m working on picking up bash scripting, but are there any tips, tricks, custom hacks or resources that anyone can recommend for a multi- UB virtual appliance system?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background:
 So for some brief background I'm a Jr SysAdmin who has been working for a contractor for a little over half a year now. We manage the entire infrastructure for our client who has a little over a handful of buildings across multiple sites totaling a few hundred rotating users plus about 1500 devices. We use sys asmin very loosely so I was actually originally intended to do help desk.
 Somehow I've somehow found my way to working with firewalls, certs, GPOs, Endpoint-Management, Patching, as well as managing our ePO.
  
The situation:
 Now when I say working on the firewall, I mean teaching our new network engineer how our firewall works as he had never interacted with it (our former left). I don't have the permissions to touch it myself, however I was asked to start managing our certs (some internal, and externals) which would have come with said permissions. I was also set up to manage a site by myself, this being on top of my usual tasks I have been working on.
 Keep in mind I am the only "jr." and make the least money in our team of almost 20 despite me being one of the only 5-ish admins who work at the enterprise level. So with this, I decided to decide to come back and tell them I would be happy to do these things under the condition that they actually pay me more (I make 60, asked for 75).
 This request was then greeted with a sudden lack of interest as well as an email to colleagues behind my back to find out everything I am involved in and/or have been handed. Additionally asking them to stop laying as much work on me.
  
The question:
 I have not received any response in an official capacity yet, but I have a bad feeling. Do you guys think it's time to start applying, or do you think it may go well?
 Thank you guys :)

 Currently going through an M365 migration (E3). I have a number of third party applications that I like (Sentinelone, Splunk, Okta etc.), but there is a number of comparable applications that seem to integrate nicely together. 
 Generally speaking, I'm against putting all my eggs in one basket but I was curious if anyone has pulled the trigger and moved to 100% (or close to) 365/Azure/Sentinel setup and what your experience has been.
 Thanks!

 A bit stumped on this one, as I've never seen this before. During this TCP handshake between a client and server, I noticed the client sends a [FIN, ACK] on step 3. Any ideas what could be happening here? Has anyone else encountered this?
 For context, I'm basically trying to send Netflow from a load balancer to a NetFlow collector. The firewall is not blocking this connection, but shows the app as 'incomplete'.
 Here's what I found:
 client: syn server: syn, ack client: fin, ack <---- ? server: ack server: fin, ack client: ack

Right now we're running a smaller Ubiquiti setup (12 switches and 20 Aps, since 2106) without a single failure, but we wanted to step up to a more professional grade brand, investigating Juniper, Ruckus, Forti and Huawei, however the first quotations are expensive, compared to our budget. 
 We need: 
  
24 ports switches: 6 units
 48 ports switches: 15 units
 Eventually 12 aggregation switches (in case there's no stacking option, such as for Ubiquiti)
 78 Wifi 6e APs
  
We have received a Netgear offer, but honestly, at that level I'd rather stay with Ubiquiti. 
 Just wondering if there is any other brand, which deserves to be mentioned, standing in between the top brands and the lower ones (Ubiquiti & Netgear)

 Radio silence for over 2 hours.
 "I'm just finishing up the list, I should have it over to you any minute now."
 Around 4pm I get on another call with a co-worker talking about some weirdness with my Azure portal login. We're on the phone until nearly 5pm, and by this time I completely forgot about the deployment, because I never saw anything come over. So I log off for the day.
 I'm on PTO today, and I get pinged about that deployment from my manager, on behalf of the guy who requested the deployment. Apparently they sent me the info after 4:30pm, and my bosses response after I told him that was "4:30 is still within core hours".

They offer the thin cables but I have mixed feelings about those, especially for PoE patches. Can anyone recommend other brands of Cat6 patch cables that can be ordered in custom lengths and colors with snagless plugs at least as good as the FS ones? I think I would also be fine with Cat5e as I rock a 1 Gbps network.

Got a hit on a suspicious email over the weekend and since I'm on call I decided to take a look. What that email contained was a Powerpoint presentation and a large Excel file with several macros from an outside consulting company that we have hired. Basically, it details a large push to outsource almost all of our business processes by 2026. This includes all of IT. The plan is that we will cut down to less than 1200 employees.
 So, couple of questions. Those have went through an outsourcing before, is it customary for the employees being laid off to be asked to help in the transition? Only scenario I can see that being appealing if I was only a few years from retirement. Is there any other incentive for me to stick around?
 Besides updating my resume, anything else I should do?

I can establish an iBGP peering between the two routers and they exchange routes successfully. However, the firewall itself is unaware of that routing table and therefore does not know how to route to networks beyond the directly connected. While I can also peer iBGP with the firewall I would prefer not to. How can I set up an iBGP peering without also having the firewall participate in BGP?
 I think I would need some other IGP such as OSPF between the routers and the firewall with redistribution from BGP to OSPF in order to make this work. Does that make sense? It seems like a good compromise.

 TL;DR: How to peer BGP between two routers without having to peer BGP with the firewall between them?

 Sorry, bit of a word salad there. Basically, as I'm sure a lot of you can relate to, we have software that will be two or three versions out of date but aren't aware of it due to the time that would be needed to check each and every piece of software individually.

 Any help/input would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it’s my first foray into MPO and I got stuck.
 I bought an MPO Type A cable and two Type A MPO-to-12xLC cassettes off FS.
 I know these should be straight 1-1 connected (port 1 = port 1, port 2 = port 2, etc) so using the regular cross polarised LC-LC patch lead at both ends results in the wrong polarity. So I switched around the LC plugs on one end of one of the LC patch cables but the link is still not coming up.
 I tried different ports and even a totally different set of MPO cable and cassettes.
 Using a simple LC-LC patch cable, eliminating the entire MPO/cassette path between the two end devices works fine.
 It’s all singlemode so I cannot “see the light” to figure out what’s going on, and I don’t have any fiber testing tools.
 What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve been using Joan conference room displays for 5 years with an on-prem Joan server. Visionect had previously offered the on premise hosting without any licensing fees. 
 Today I come to work and see that all the displays have a “This device does not have an active subscription license…” message. Going out to the website, I’m not seeing any reference to the free offering any more. 
 I went through my emails to see if I had been given any heads up that the licensing was going to change, but I’m not seeing anything. Has anyone else been caught off guard with this, or was there plenty of warning and my spam filters possibly prevented me from knowing this was coming?

 I have two iR-ADV C5740 copiers.
 Recently they were moved to a new building, and now they are having issues with what seems like waking up from a deep sleep. When prints are sent, it's taking a few minutes for it to wake up and print. No settings were changed. It's on a 2 hour sleep timer, which is the longest you can set, and within that time frame it will go back into this deep sleep. It's definitely losing network connection during this sleep, which is why prints are getting stuck in a queue till a point in which it wakes back up. I've found this out when attempting to ping it when reports come in that prints aren't going through.
 Has anyone ran into something like this? I'm leaning more towards an issue with the network or switch than a sleep or energy saving setting, because like I said, nothing was changed.

 I came to the conclusion that there are two types of people that open tickets, people that want their issue resolved, people that want their issue documented and possibly resolved in the future. The second type of effectively uses tickets as a technology to do list. .
 Now, years later, in every job, for every team, every time I go through aging tickets, I identify that trend early on. Sometimes it's impossible to stop people from using the ticket queue as their personal to-do list but awareness is the first step to mitigating this issue.

 I have one Jabra Pro 925 Mono headset, did not get it with a dongle when it was ordered.
 The issue is, one of my friends accidently stopped the firmware update on the headset, it was supposed to update to 1.8.2
 Now my headset is constantly glowing with purple color and is stuck updating,(firmvare version 0.0.1) in the aplication Jabra Direct i have the option to recover but there is the catch... So whenever i press the button it goes in starting update mode and goes for hours and never finishes.
 I saw in an old post that there should be a folder in the application:
 C:\Program Files (x86)\Jabra\SDKFirmwareUpdater
 But i do not have this file type (SDKFirmwareUpdater)
 I am using the latest Jabra direct.
 Please help and thank you, for all additional info i will provide

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I was configuring a new user on Windows 11 and trying to remove onedrive libraries for the Documents folder and also set it to a custom folder. Unfortunately I answered "Yes" to the prompt that gave the following warning
 "Do you want to redirection folder 'Documents' into another system folder 'Profile' located at C:\Users\username"? If you proceed with the redirection you will not be able to separate them or restore default location."
 I've since corrected some registry settings and actually do have the Documents library folder where I want it, however in explorer whenever I view the "C:\Users" folder, instead of showing "username" for the user profile it is showing "Documents" in place of their name. (If you click on the path in the path bar it actually shows the correct username, but whenever it shows folder names anywhere it reverts to showing "Documents").
 I can't seem to find what might be causing this or where it would be set. Is it possible to correct this?
 Everything seems to be working fine, it's just showing "Documents" in place of "username" in the C:\Users folder which is bothering me.
 Thanks.

 Shortcut target is the local path name and works fine when using explorer but fails within the "Save As" dialogue of any program (Office, Notepad, ETC)
 Obviously I can work around this by updating the shortcuts to the hostname/share path but found it weird that it works fine within Explorer. There is also a lot of shortcuts to locations due to the way the business has created its workflow.
 Last update to workstations was 17/04 and we believe its been fine since the update. 
 Im sure this used to work with no issues and there's been no major changes as far as I know. Couldn't be a DNS thing could it? Looking at it I find it weird that it even works in the first place and is still working in explorer considering the target path is D:\ rather than \\hostname

 Currently a helpdesk tech looking to learn more about networks to eventually move to a networks admin role.
 Just wanted to ask for a little help. I have been tasked with moving a switch over to a new site.
 I have the switch with me and have been given the new ip address and hostname i need to assign to the box.
 My question is how would I hook up the device so it's discoverable on the network?
 I assume I would have to physically connect one of the ports on the switch to the other stack of switches already there?
 After i do this i assume i just console onto the switch and change the hostname and IP.
 Thanks in advance for the help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've successfully installed PFSense and working fine. This was a response to Nokia gpon modem router crashing but unfortunately the problem continues. 
 PROBLEM ISP supplied Nokia Gpon ont modem router crashes within 24 or Max 48 hours. Replaced Nokia 3 times and works fine for a month and then starts crashing every 24 hours ISP doesn't offer bridge mode 
 SETUP -Nokia GPON ont modem router with 100Mbps -VLAN trunnked to a Cisco switch and then -Connected to pfsense double NAT (ISP doesn't offer bridge) -Connected to Cisco wlan controller and APs Avg clients connected 200 - pfsense CPU usage at 2% and RAM at 24% temp normal - standard firewall rules except blocked ipv6 broadcasts -rfc1918 disabled on lan and wan -dns resolver and forwarder setup (was having issue with iphones not dnsing, now solved) - daily avg traffic up and down is 500GB - no captive portal - no dual wan - LAN subnet is 192.168.31.0/22 -pfsense wan IP is 192.168.1.2 -ISP modem router lan IP 192.168.1.1 - obviously public IP on isp router 
 This is what I have tried so far 
  
limit sessions to max 20k -session expiry 5 hours (default was 24 hours and sessions were reaching 20K) 
 traffic shaper using limiters limits speed to 20Mbps up and down
 DHCP expiry 6 hours (majority of clients change every 24 hours)
 nftop monitoring (found torrents and blocked)
  
Temp solution is to restart the Nokia and everything works fine. 
 What am I missing here? There is no way to bridge the modem and no other isp serves this area. 
 What is crashing the NoKia gpon ont modem router? 
 How can I use pfsense to detect the issue and solve it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 I've got a customer who is moving from a flat network into an ACI/SDA, and want to move their various BMS devices in with them. First thing to move in will be the door access.
 Does anyone have much experience of this? As the door access are all on a flat subnet, they work nicely, then I move them into the SDA, do I need to run an L2 transit specifically for their own VN, or is IP Directed Broadcast where I need to be looking?
 The longer term plan is to move the BMS server into the ACI from the current LAN - as a further question, how can that be integrated? I'm siding with L2 transit..
 Best, CC

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a situation where I'm working for an IT broker, mainly just doing some really basic testing on second hand components. Even though it involves servers and other enterprise equipment, I don't really know anything about setting them up. I'm slowly getting further and further into debt because it doesn't pay well, and I don't feel that I'll ever progress past the point I'm at now because this is literally all the company does. I'm at a total dead end. It's really impacting me mentally and I'm legitimately getting worried that one day I'll just decide to give up on everything.
 I've tried applying to a couple of IT support and SysAdmin jobs locally but it's clear that I don't have the skills they're looking for. I have no skills in anything else either, no degree or anything like that. All I can really do is self-teach if I ever get the motivation to do so. But it seems that everything I look at seems to be giving me different answers. I just want to know, from some people in the industry, what sorts of things should I be looking at when gaining the skills for a SysAdmin job? What software, languages etc should I be learning to use? Any way to learn them for free or as cheap as possible? I can't afford any kind of certification like CCNA or CompTIA, so is it worth making a portfolio? How would I do that?
 Basically just any advice would be much appreciated. I'm so lost and overwhelmed right now.

 But wait, the WLAN drivers are missing, so I can't get onto the internet to disable it in the store. Fine I'll just install the drivers.
 Oh no, you can't run .exe files in S Mode... So I need to get online to disable S mode but I can't get online with S mode active... Fine I'll just disable S mode in regedit.
 Oh no, not even regedit will load in S Mode. So now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
 Trying regedit in recovery mode shows me the SkuPolicyRequired value as already set to 0 so that's no help either.
 a) any ideas?
 b) why is S mode a thing?!

 I hate media converters, but have ran into many issues; 1. lack of PoE, 2. not passing client disconnect messages, and 3. not passing EAPoL messages (specifically media converter switch issue).
 Has anyone else here experienced similar issues with their media converters, mainly #2 and #3? Do you have any you would recommend?

 We're currently installing a few hundred Verkada cameras but needing a Windows 3rd party IP camera viewer solution since they now support RSTP streaming. Mainly to have lower latency surveillance but also to ease up access rights management via Verkada command.
 Has anyone got any recommendations for a fit for production solution that has manageability, allows profiles / configs and can span across multiple screens? A lot of the stuff I've found so far has been suitable for homelab and small integrations but not on a bigger scale.
 Thanks all

 They are also reporting 500 errors when accessing Outlook online with the "more information" giving a Microsoft Exchange Data Storage MailboxCrossSiteFailoverException error
 It doesn't seem to be a network issue as other users on the same sites are connecting fine, and as far as I know the mobile apps are working fine.
 MS service status isn't showing anything either 
 Anyone else seeing this or are we just that bit more special?
 EDIT: MS service health page is showing impact to Outlook desktop and Web clients as part of their fix to a search issue from yesterday. Looks like this is our problem

 As I’ve just landed a placement working as a junior cybersecurity analyst as apart of my college course. Admittedly, I have past experience in the field (home projects/CTFs).
 Please, if your thinking of a career in IT, go for it. Someone out there will take you, I’ve had to contact every company in my local city and towns around it and got this one and others are now offering. If you don’t take initiative, how can you know what you can do?
 For those wondering, I’m mainly going to be shadowing and assisting with governance, vulnerability scanning and occasional SOC work.
 My next steps, learn. Learn. Learn. Having no certifications means I have a lot to learn ;).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I am trying to setup a Windows 10 Multi App Kiosk with some camera software (Hikvision iVMS-4200 Desktop client) which requires admin privileges. Please note this a staff facing kiosk not a public facing kiosk.
 Following this tutorial (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps). I have managed to set up my Kiosk on a Standard Windows Account. With a seperate Admin Account to manage the PC. In the kiosk when I click on the application it triggers the "User Account Control" (UAC) pop up asking for the admin password. 
 I have tried the following to bypass this:
  
Changing UAC settings in Control Panel to have not notify. This works for the standard account when not in Kiosk Mode. But when I apply the kiosk provisioning package it seems to turn UAC back on. 
 Changing the compatibility settings to "Run as Admin" for the exe.
 Following (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/app_compatibility_view.html) from Reddit Question (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/khda06/windows_10_kiosk_mode_running_an_app_with/) I have tried to change this to "Run as Invoker". 
 Changing the permissions of the folder in which the exe lives in to give standard accounts full permission over that folder.
  
All of these "fixes" work when the kiosk account normally but stops working when I apply the kiosk mode.
 This would make sense as the single app kiosk docs say that UAC need to be enabled for it to work (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/kiosk-single-app). I presume this is the same for multi app kiosk mode.
 Essentially is there any way that I can get an application requiring admin privileges running inside a kiosk without
 Or is there another work around. Something like are we able to create an admin account that could use its password to pass the UAC but does not have a "Desktop Login". Then I can just share that password. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently landed a gig consulting for about $150/hr. Contract is 6 months, but this is government work so it could probably last a year or more.
 Post COVID, with the advent of much more remote work, I've begun exploring taking several lower level positions that are 100% remote to help me reach my financial retirement goals sooner. 
 I feel like my salary is atypical. A 300k job for an engineer is quite rare in my opinion, but on /r/sales it seemed to be suggested that this was quite normal, with people going up to 500-700k and beyond for exceptional performers. 
 Now, working multiple lower end jobs, I can see myself comfortably achieving 300~500k (2-3 jobs). I basically just see myself as my own consulting business, taking on multiple clients who renting my time. Whether they use it or not is up to them. 
 I'm just hoping to get an engineer's take on how much of what is said on /r/sales about those salaries is chest thumping versus reality. Are 250k-300k sales jobs typical? I know SEs that get 220~240 for OTE. 
 I feel like you could be a great salesman, get a shitty account list at the wrong time (for example competing vendor wins project) and then be left with a dry patch and fail to make your number. Idk, it seems like it's not always under your control.

 If you have a router in front of your firewall and a small IP block from your ISP do you generally set up a transit VLAN between the router/firewall using your public space and NAT on the firewall or run RFC1918 space between them and NAT at the router? 
 I feel like it would be more beneficial to dPAT at the edge and static NAT whatever on the inside needs to be accessible but I see a lot of people deploying public IP space on the transit VLAN between router/fw and NAT on the FW.

 I have a situation where I need to find a way to retain BitLocker recovery keys outside of Azure AD/On-prem AD.
 We are trying to use a new auditing system that can recover deleted AD/Azure devices but not the recovery key leaf. Are there any products or means to pull those keys from AD and securely retain them outside of those systems?
 I've looked around but no products have really stood out as a stand-alone option for this situation.

I am looking at a topology map for this network and see no public IP addresses at the branch offices. I wonder if this was not added by mistake or if I misunderstood something. 
 I guess my question here is if you are using MPLS does each branch location get its own public ip address for the internet? or is everything routed to the primary office then sent out to the internet? 
 If anyone has any material on this, I would really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. I’m knees deep in a cloning project for 17 laptops using Clonezilla and I’m wondering why you would use Sysprep in audit mode. 
 In my case- all my laptops that are getting imaged are all the same model. 
 After I’m done building my reference image, I plan on Sysprepping with /oobe/generalize and shutdown options. (I’ll also make sure I delete the user I’ve been using to install everything and create a new “offline account” to run sysprep so as not to trigger the Windows Store from interfering with Sysprep. Before reboot I’ll clone. 
 Let’s say after I sysprep, I realize I forgot a piece of software, or want to tweak a setting. 
 Wouldn’t it be just as easy to boot into the oobe, make any changes and sysprep again rather than going into Audit mode? You can sysprep the same image 1001 times now. Perhaps Audit mode was a better option when sysprep was limited to 3 times?
 Looking for an easy explanation of why/when to use Audit mode in sysprep. 
 Thanks guys!
 Edit to ask another question:
 Can you unbox a new laptop with an OEM image of Windows 10 , customize then sysprep it? Or do you need to install a Volume Lic version of your own on the new laptop? I have a MAK license.

How well would you assess the security based on the above?
 Is there anything else I should do to have give myself peace of mind the boxes will stay secure?Would you recommend installing unattended updates?
 Are there any tools that can assess the security of a box? And make adjustments? 
 I'm a bit new to this, I'm interested to know what the industry standards are.

 Aruba says it needs to be an Aruba transceiver. Fortigate says it needs fortigate. Go figure... 
 DAC would be ideal since it's a very short run but if anyone knows of optics that would work, that's fine too. Trying not to break the bank with 20k transceivers here. Don't want to keep buying things that "might" work.

I’m frustrated, tired, and just pissed that I am 36 and having to potentially change careers because if I don’t my mental health is gonna send my physical into a spiral and I leave my wife a widow at 40. 
 If you read all of this thank you for joining my TedRant. I’m gonna go for a walk and try not to break down anymore today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if anyone would look at a design I threw together. The goals of this are:
  
The firewalls provide NGFW and NGIPS features between every VLAN and VPN connections to remote sites
 The Nexus switches will be 10Gbps connection for quite a few access switches. Only server and 1 department are depicted in this picture
 Full redundancy
  
My concerns with the design
  
Are the firewalls appropriately placed to provide IPS and FW functions?
 Are the Nexus switches overkill for this topology?
  
Any tips/assistance/comments will be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I'm just kinda going crazy, and needed some advice! I applied for a call center position with a small company in my home town. I got called for the interview, and when I showed up, they immediately said that they needed me on their IT department based on my Resume (10+ years of self employed computer repair experience). I've only done low level repair work, and some minor networking, and I was completely honest about that. Well they hired me as a salaried junior network engineer, and just told me to learn as much as I could, and that they understood that this would be a learning process for me. I've just finished my 90 days and I have had everything dumped on me by my supervisor from configuring firewall rules to setting up domain controllers with nothing more than a "you'll figure it out". Thankfully I've been able to handle all the craziness thrown at me, mainly because I'm excellent at troubleshooting, but I've been terrified this whole time, and I'm extremely fearful that I'll mess something important up. I know I'm not qualified to do sysadmin duties just yet, but they're forcing me to do it. I've been made global admin within my first month of being here. Is this just imposter syndrome, and I should keep going and pray for the best, or should I let them know that I'm feeling overwhelmed before I face an issue that could hurt my reputation. Sorry it's so long just freaking out lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I volunteer for a youth organization that has a camp in BFE. Strangely, BFE has FTTH... Anyway, I co-admin the network spread between the various buildings on the property through fiber. Currently, services just include wireless internet, voip phones, and a couple of hardwired printers. Long range, I'd love to add some security cameras, but I need to get buy-in from the professional leadership that own/lead the camp. The network is purposefully flat with no vlans for quick repair and troubleshooting if one of the skilled network admins aren't on site.
 Historically, we've used older Cisco PoE switches (3750, or thereabouts) purchased off of ebay or the random cast-off from corporate donors along with a Cisco cleanair n-wireless controller and APs for wireless. Generally speaking, we only need 8 PoE ports plus a SFP uplink in 99% of our buildings since other than phones and wireless APs, everything is done over wireless.
 The most common failure mode of our switches are power supply failure, either from old age or occasionally poor power conditions. But, obtaining switches to replace a couple every year has been difficult and adding up. The Cisco 3750s are between $60-100 generally on ebay, but I am wondering if there's a better value PoE switch out there that isn't so long in the tooth? Yes, I know $100 or less per switch is really a pretty good deal, but when the budget is $0 and you have a very small pool of people willing to donate money or equipment, it gets demoralizing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 i am trying to troubleshoot why some OT devices in a big vlan ~281 hosts are not responding to ping after some time.
 We have a Client where every 30min a ftp connection to a ot devices is established. Sometimes we get the notification that the ftp transfer failed. The client is in a seperate vlan.
 I tried to sniff packets from the ftp client and the only thing I see is TCP Retransmissions of the first SYN packet everytime.
 Then I looked at the port where the ftp server is connected and I see that the TCP Syn Packets are arriving there. Also I can ping other devices on the same vlan during this time but I don't get SYN ACK packets back from the server.
 I see that the ftp server sends "Who has 192.168.100.254? Tell 192.168.100.250" then the Gateway responds with "192.168.100.254 is at 00:09:0f:09:1c:be". It is like this over and over until you restart the ot ftp device. The delay between the arp who has tell is 6,9,5,11,27 seconds.
 What could that be? A ping also from the same vlan to the ot ftp device during this time is also not possible.
 EDITED: IT's 281 not 1022 active Hosts the Subnet's size would be 1022 Hosts but only 281 Hosts are currently connected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been running Fortinet & Ubiquiti switches and AP's for a while, but now we might have a good line on Datto equipment.
 On the one hand, I REALLY like the Fortinet devices because of SPOG management and the NAC-lite features when integrated with FortiGate has been useful in our more secure environments.
 Ubiquiti is just plain affordable for our SMB clients and while it's nowhere near as feature rich, the base features are pretty easy enough to use that my techs don't need to know ALL the networking stuff to do some basic troubleshooting if they have to. Plus, the flex mini switch is honestly a godsend - a $30 managed/ish POE-powered switch is a fantastic alternative to some random box that gets added when someone needs just one more port.
 Our company uses Kaseya which means we could manage the network from our RMM platform - a potentially huge benefit. But I only know Datto from its software, not as a networking company, so I'm curious if their hardware actually holds up

 But over the last 6 months or so, we are seeing a dramatic climb in space usage, and we have had to provision more sharepoint space accordingly. But...we dont know whats causing it.
 Most of the teams sites are private, so they dont show up as anything more than 0 when looking at space. And powershell reports to CSV dont show much change of hard drive space at all. 
 For example, over the weekend, 10GB used up. 
 Frankly, Im unimpressed with how M365 reports some of this, so I figure there must be a better way, but maybe not. Thought I would flip it to you all to see if anyone has run into this before, and some pointers?

We have any application that started failing authentication and it didn't work again until we uninstalled the patches from the DCs. This app uses a keytab file using RC4 and we have updated the service account msds-supportedencryption type to RC4 (which is what allowed it to work after the November patches). Interestingly enough, another application using the same keytab / service account (I know bad practice) continued to work fine but it was using our updated 2019 domain controllers (the broken app can't use these ones at the moment). I didn't see anything specific in the patch info that would be a smoking gun for this issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm fairly new to GPO and I'm trying to create a task to get all PC's to reboot every Friday. I've created an OU and placed all PC's that need to have this applied in there and created a schedule task policy against the OU. I tested this by having my own PC in this ou, and it was the only one at the time for testing purposes, and it worked. Now that I've moved the rest of the PC's in the OU it doesn't work. To make sure I'm getting the policy applied I run gpupdate /r and see it there and when i run gpupdate /force... Immediately I open up task scheduler and I don't see the task the policy is supposed to create.... The task was there during the testing though.... So I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong...🤔

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: We started using Defender as our AV for endpoints about a year ago since it's included with out MS licensing. Prior to that, we were using ESET, and we are currently using it in our server environment.
 Right now, my boss and I are trying to figure out if Defender is a good fit for our on-prem servers. The only critical thing that they're doing is DNS and DHCP management. None of them are open to the world. We have some internal teams using apps on different servers, but they're not critical to the operation.
 Has anyone used Defender in their server environment? Why or why not? I'll be transparent in saying that I'm not super familiar with either Defender nor ESET and am currently doing my research. I just like coming here to see what other people's experiences are.

 Hey everyone,
 With the unknowns in the economy, which lower cost of living city (prefer small to mid-sized) would you suggest relocating to? Currently in a major city - new location should have plenty of available IT jobs (excluding help-desk). Please include pros and cons for suggestions. This is for the US. Considering the midwest and perhaps south, southeast. However, open to options if the area is right - relatively safe and housing options are not the size of a shoebox.
 Thanks.

 Some sites are small, with just a few users, and a couple sites are larger with access points, cameras, etc.
 If we replace our aging 2960x's at remote sites, Meraki has two models we are looking at:
 MS225 (no ospf, but capable of 16 static routes)
 MS250 (ospf, also does static routes)
 Do we "need" to pay extra for the MS250 in this case? Does OSPF matter at the edge if we are only using one strand of fiber?

 We host a domain-controller (2016) where they have been using folder redirection for some time.
 All of the devices are located on 4 other sites, connected with site-to-site VPN to the DC on the gateway-level.
 I want to revert this and move everything back to the local userprofiles.
 I ticked the box "Redirect the folder back to the local userprofile location when policy is removed", made sure that was spinning for some days before setting "Not configured" on all the folder redirections one at a time every other day. (Just to prevent slowdowns)
 Nothing happened.
 Tried enabling one of them and set it to "Redirect to the local userprofile location" and restarted.
 Got an error in Event Viewer (502) stating that the path couldn't be reached, it could be offline, even though I can ping and browse to \server\folder redirection.
 Any ideas on what might be wrong or other ways to move everything back to the respective user's local profile?

 We bought a Office 2019 proffesional plus license online.
 ( i like to add that we did this over a 100 times before and that went well all the time.)

 I start 1 of the office applications ( i does not matter wich one. in this case i use word)
  
The screen pop up comes that asks for a product key, so i put in the product key
 
i press activate office
 
a new screen comes that asks me to sign in.
 
when i enter the account its shows this account does not exist
 
 The same occurs when i log in to word first and then try to activate, same bad result.
 That why its so weird, ik can login to the office 2019 app and it reconizes the account, when i go activate office it shows account unknown. 
 I hope someone can help me....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try to make this as brief as possible. We're in the process of transitioning off our AS400 system. IBM said they would provide us with technical (hardware & software) support until August (to get support even up until this date has taken direct appeals to IBM for extensions on our support contract). I'm not sure what happened, but that story and timeline has changed to April 30th.
 (I believe it was simply human error on our end, a misread or something, but that is really irrelevant here and now.) 
 So, now we are scrambling to find a viable option for hardware support for this interim period (4-6 months) until we've fully switched to a new system. And to be clear, the team that setting up our new system is not equipped to handle support requests that might come in for the existing AS400 system.
 ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: we are a rather small - I'd like to say almost mom/pop type - manufacturer in Northern New Jersey (Carlstadt, Bergen County). They've used the AS400 for nearly 30/35 years and what little tech expertise we had, has long ago left. I'm a new (~2 years) web designer and developer (and unfortunately, the all around IT person) here and the only person with adequate and competent technical skills. So i've been asked for help with this. 
 I'd be happy to answer questions if anyone has any relevant, but I am hoping experts out there might have some solid advice for me on where to start looking. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE TO ANYONE THAT TAKES THE TIME TO READ AND APPLY, I APPRECIATE IT.

 I started a business and needing a mailserver. I have different domains on my Cloudflare account which i want to use.
 Im going to use google workspace mainly with domain A.
 I also have domain B which is used by my services (git etc. to send emails)
 I also have domain C and D which are for my customers. 
 So im looking at a mail hosting with different tiers for example a lite tier with almost none features except sending emails and a tier which can be used as a daily mail.
 Does anyone know such a hoster?
 Looked at Mailbox.org and Zoho mail but idk if there is something better.
 Thank you all! Would be nice if someone could help me!

I mean after a number of different certifications will you all the time have to start studiing for recertifications or will different certifications work together in such a way that one renewal will also help the other renewal? Are there any examples? For example, does one get extra learning points for CCNP if they have other professional certifications?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Outlook signatures contain images promoting our upcoming events. We rotate these images every 2-3 weeks.
 Currently, our marketing teams sends an email around, asking everyone to update their signature, but this (obviously) is very annoying and I quite often see users with outdated signatures.
 What I tried:
  
Disclaimer in Microsoft 365 Exchange - not feasible because it doesn't support images and would require IT to build HTML from whatever the marketing team comes up with.
 Set-OutlookSignatures - Doesn't seem reliable. I had it fail for some mailboxes and couldn't figure out the reason for the errors "mailbox does not exist". It's decently documented, but it's OSS after all with no real support.
 Third party solutions - They cost like 5 bucks per user per month and I cannot get that budget approved. Also, an Outlook plugin alone doesn't really do it, because it cannot be used on Mac, phones or Outlook Web.
  
Ideally, I need a way to attach content from a Word document to all emails, so that the marketing team can change and update the signature on their own. We have around 35 employees.
 Any reliable, low-maintenance, not-too-expensive solutions you would recommend for an organziation with 35 employees?

 I'm looking for a server lift for our server rooms. Untill now we've handled all servers/storage by hand, and in ways that would send a health and safety officer off to go rock themselves to sanity in a corner. 
 Our server rooms are wrongly set out, but thats the way it's going to remain... We have pretty small "aisles" Infront of each rack, so if we were to get a lift it would need to be quite small wheel based.
 Do any of you have something in mind? Either electric or manual crank is fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Networkers,
 I have been trying to configure 802.1X with EAP-TLS in a Windows domain for a while now. Using freshly installed Win Server 2022 for DC and PKI, and ClearPass in a Lab environment (was set up after the configuration didn't work in the production environment). 
 Certificates for computer and user authentication are distributed cleanly via autoenrollment and authentication on the network works fine - but only after the user GPOs have already been processed and the user is already on the desktop. With this, the GPOs for folder redirects and drive mappings don't work because the client can't reach the file server without user authentication. Wireshark shows me that the client first tries to get to the file server long before 802.1X user authentication takes place.
 If I disconnect the network connection while logged in and re-establish it, authentication works immediately. 
 Microsoft support has not been able to help us so far and Aruba is not aware of the problem either.
 Do you have any tips?

Just got a job as an It Support which won't include just regular helpdesk tasks but also more and more administrator stuff etc... So there's a few things I wanna ask.
 We're a company of around 60 employees and are expanding pretty fast, so we have to put some more effort on the safety side of things. Right now we have a shared network domain (is this the right term?) Where we have access to the same files etc... Now we'd also like to have a local? domain, where all users would fall under one place and at login you'd have that thing where you can log in to user or into administrator. We also have 4-5 MacOS users. How would that go, to have windows and mac on the same AD? What to use? Co-worker was mentioning LDAP and FREEIPA? I also saw something about NoMAD? Is there a way to have two factor authentication to log-in to windows?
 + when we'd have all of that set up, what would be the best tool to manage everything? Right now we're using Synology I think, for granting access to users for certain files... I also saw something about JAMF?
 ​
 Sorry if all of this is written poorly, as I said, currently my understanding of all off this is not the best, but I'd like to come up with a suggestion or two of "my own", if any of you would have a suggestion or two or point me in the right direction, that would be great.

 i had previously used the same driver on a different vps provider (vultr) & it worked flawlessly there meaning after installing the ethernet driver, it instantly connected to the internet.
 edit: i'm thinking becoz the windows not asking my permission to install the driver, it for some reason isn't installing the driver correctly even though it appears on device manager menu. i don't know what exactly is the issue, so i'm just spitballing here.

 I've looked at a few FOSS options for various tasks, but the vast majority are self-hosted and for someone who has next to no Linux, Docker, etc experience and no time to maintain them, a lot of FOSS isn't viable.
 One tool in particular that I'm looking for is a way to manage logs from various sources (firewall, servers, etc.).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have currently a Server 2016 based RDS farm using roaming profiles. Everything is working just fine there. Whenever we install office in the OfficeDeploymentTool config file I have the information to use roaming licensing tokens
 Property Name="SCLCacheOverride" Value="1" /> <Property Name="SharedComputerLicensing" Value="1" /> <Property Name="SCLCacheOverrideDirectory" Value="%appdata%\Microsoft\Office" /> 
 Everything works just the way it should on those servers.
 So now im looking to move up to Server2019 based RDS host. I install office the same way, but on the 2019 host it doesn't seem to ever download the token. When you open office products you are greeted with a "Sign in to setup office" you click ok then get "Activate Office" At that point it ask for your email. Plug that information in but then it never ask for a password. Then all your office products get the pink banner up top stating "problem with shared computer licensing" I looked at the registry entries and those are correct. If I log into the 2016 RDS, activate office then copy one of the tokens. I can log out of the 2016 then come back to the 2019 and the token roams over and office is activated and just fine. Its just the initial downloading of the tokens that 2019 seems to be having a problem with. Is there something I'm missing about getting it working on 2019?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm trying to find an SMB grade router to replace the one we currently have (TP-Link Archer MR400 w/ 4G LTE), in order to support more devices.
 Some context:
 Currently, we already have around ~60 devices and we're starting to see problems with some devices being unreachable once we add new ones to the network.
 These are IoT devices (Shelly1 and Shelly Pro1), so the network traffic, while busy (mainly MQTT keep alive messages and similar payloads), shouldn't be the actual problem, rather it seems we're just hitting the maximum number of supported devices connected simultaneously.
 We have two locations (~400m distance) that share the same network. The IoT devices are located in two cabinets in each site.
 On the main site, we have a mix of Shelly1's connected via Wi-Fi and Shelly Pro1's connected by cable (RJ45) to the router.
 On the second site we only have Shelly1's, which connect to an access point that is then connected via cable to the router in the main site.
 Technically, most devices connect to the router by cable, rather than Wi-Fi.
 Given we'll be adding more devices (cable only, no Wi-Fi) in the near future, we want something that could handle from 100 to ~200 devices.
 I found related questions here, here and here, but didn't quite help.
 Could you share your experiences in similar scenarios and what you have used?
 I appreciate your time.
 Cheers,
 Q

 I also have some pure site to site vpn ipsec with others that it's "done" the ISR routers.
 On the ISR routers i also want to do the NAT + IPSEC site to site vpn + Anyconnect
 Can you also please come with other ideas/opinon ? It's a good design ? bad design ?
 the actual network right now it's in a bad shape and that's why i need to redesign the things.
 It's a not a big network behind ( 200 - 300 users something like that and more of them are practically remote and connecting via the anyconnect ).
 Also there are some servers behind ( 2 vcenters with some virtual servers + storage ).
 What do you thing ?

 I have a layer 3 switch with a handful of vlans and SVI configured. I need to configure inter-VLAN multicast routing.
 The source and receivers are in separate subnets which terminate on the layer 3 switch.
 Multicast traffic does not need to route beyond the layer 3 switch.
 Can I just: 
 enable ‘ip multicast routing’ globally and ‘ip pim dense-mode’ on the SVI’s?
 Or is it better to:
 enable a loopback on the L3 switch, configure ‘ip PIM rp-address <loopback IP>’
 Configure ‘ip pim sparse-mode’ on the SVI
 Configure IGMP snooping on the downstream L2 switch ports? Is this required or just preferable?
 Or are both approaches wrong? 
 I have never needed to configure mcast until now and my only experience is reading the CCNP ENCOR OCG / watching Kevin Wallace videos / googling around. 
 Would either of the above approaches work or have I missed something crucial due to inexperience?
 Thanks as always!

 I'm trying to wrap my head around why anyone would choose this type of firewall for a small office that has 5-7 employees.
 When asked what is the purpose of the server is the owner doesn't even know. They only use the Nas for their data but that is a discussion for another time. My concern right now is why fortigate? Is it that much better than a Sonicwall or a pfsense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just completed an overhaul of a nightmare network cabinet at a lab. I can't post before/after images here unfortunately. 
 I've used a 15U wall mount cabinet that houses some fans at the top, an Adva box, a Cisco box, a Draytek router, two 24 port patch panels, two 24 port Netgear switches and a PDU.
 I left a 1U gap between all the active equipment units. I mounted a 1U horizontal cable management bar between each patch panel and network switch. There's no spare space left in the cabinet.
 I used 50cm patch cables as I read this is the minimum certified length. However, the patch cables have ended up looking messy as there's no way to make them look neat unless I used shorter cables which I'm kinda reluctant to.
 So the question is, did I goof and should have gotten a bigger cabinet and left 2U for the patch cables or should I just go with shorter patch cables?
 Patchsave sell 10cm and 20cm ones.

 What is the most modern thing with the least friction people are doing these days?
 SCCM is overkill I think and I don't have a person to manage that platform anyway.
 Does anyone have experience with azure arc? even if we have no workloads on azure that looks like an interesting option.
 is there anything else I haven't thought of?
 The environment is relatively static. GPOs and WSUS take care of patching right now. Most of the applications running on these machines are unique snowflakes that don't work well with automation. So things are...ok.
 However whenever we want to make a small change to servers or deploy some kind of agent or new tool, its a pain in the ass without central management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, after 7 years in RMF/GRC roles I have had enough and it is not the right fit (ok, I actually decided after year 1 but am just making the move now lol). I love technology and building things and think a career in networking is a better fit.
 I need to make a plan to get an entry level role in networking and need some assistance.
 ---------------------------------
 Wants:
  
I need a degree: I know WGU is nice and I can obtain CCNA shortly after. Anyone have any better recommendations? Cost is not an issue but time is, I want to finish it as fast as I can.
 I need certs: I only hold CISSP and Sec + (expired). I plan on CCNA and possibly some AWS certs (architect and dev ops associates).
 I need a job: I need to land an entry level networking role that can get me the experience needed to progress in the field.
 Future: I eventually want to progress to network engineer or network security engineer. Am not entirely sure what credentials (other than experience) I would need for this career.
  
---------------------------------
 Experience/me: 
  
I am 40 years old and retired military, am I too old? I know age discrimination is a real thing in this field.
 8 years military related IT roles in IT security. All RMF and compliance focused.
 4 of those years I did light sys admin work for classified networks. Helped design and build a few network segments and have hands on with VOIP, VTC, encryption (TACLAN) and Active Directory.
 Fluent in Linux (was studying for OSCP) and win environments. 
 Have studied for AWS certs and could prob pass the dev ops assoc. in two months time. CCNA would prob take me month or so as well.
  
---------------------------------
 So, what are your thoughts, recommendations or concerns? 
 If you have any advice or experience making a transition like this I would love to hear from you as well.
 Any ideas on how I can make this plan better or more efficient please let me know as well.
 Actually, any advice would be helpful.

 Does it matter what OS domain joined computers are on? From everything I've read only the lowest DC server version matters. So if you have a 2016 DC and a 2022 DC you can raise to 2016 domain functional level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading somewhere about this but I am not sure if it's true for most devices. Does this true for SSD disks? Can I have an SSD disk and periodically (once a week) connect it to a power supply or a computer to "refresh" the charges? Is there a way to determine if my USB flash drive refreshes the data automatically when I plug it in?
 Or it's best to delete the data with the Secure Erase unit command or similar method and then rewrite it?
 If I make a second copy does this guarantee to make a copy of the data or there are algorithms for deduplication that prevent it? My experience is that writing the data twice is about twice as slow, therefore I assume no deduplication happens. But I am not sure about all devices.
 My main concern with not erasing the drive and writing the data again is that the file allocation table may get damaged because some of the bits are not overwritten (refreshed). And I may get a random gibberish when I try to read my files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little background before I ask the question. I have been in IT for over 10 years. At my current job for 7 of that 10. Started as a deskside tech then network admin and as of 4 years ago a sysadmin. My manager at the time saw me doing more than just the network so he wanted to give me a different title as I worked with all the systems. The only way for me to make more than the 5% a year raise is to become a SR sysadmin. We had three SR sysadmins and then me up until 2 years ago when 2 randomly left. I stepped up and became lead on all major projects because I was skilled in many areas. The remaining SR was just apps and that is it. I worked with the Manger at the time to change my title and he wanted to base the requirements off of the past SRs job descriptions. I was ok with this because my skills and projects matched it. Thought I had it in the bag.... then the manager left.... nothing had been finalized or in writing. A new manager has been brought in and believes a SR is based off how many Certificates you have. Nothing is changing his mind. I asked if they would pay for them and he said yes. So I want to brush up on them and just start scheduling. I have had plenty early on to help my growth but they expired. He probably does not believe my talent and I want to hold him to it. Kind of a malicious compliance. Maybe he is trying to save money while under paying me for as long as he can...
 Question: would it become an issue if I started taking one every two weeks? Would is cause me any issues? Like would they question whether I was cheating or not? 
 I attend yearly training for any upcoming projects. As an example. When we moved to palo alto firewalls I took a week long boot camp and got certified 4 years ago.(expired in oct) We planned to move to azure. So I took another bootcamp to get ready. About to attend a bootcamp for my CISSP.

 Current I guess you would call me a junior sysadmin. I support about 6 very small schools, all using windows systems. I'm pretty confident in day to day tasks with windows server, win 10, and iPad support at this point.
 In your opinion, if I were to start looking at finding a new job, would you recommend upskilling further with windows server to the point I could potentially be a sysadmin on my own for a smaller business. Start learning everything I can about Linux systems (I have literally 0 experience with Linux) or look into cloud systems such as Azure or something else? Where do you see the most opportunities being opened up?

 I have a ton of MFA codes I use for work and I need a good iOS app that I can have a backup and is easy to switch and restore on another device.
 I already have Okta for my company stuff and Microsoft’s app for that stuff but a lot of our clients SIEMs need MFA so I have like 20+ codes I used daily.
 I initially set up Duo on my Android since IT recommended that for storing backups in Google Drive, but then I got my work equipment and they sent me an iPhone so I would like to move everything over.
 Some people recommended Airbus. What’s your recommendation? I don’t want to have to annoy engineering to reset my SIEM creds if I choose a shitty app that causes problems.

I have a client I’m helping out who has a legacy Novar Savvy system that he inherited with the building he bought. It is connected to the network via an Ethernet cable. However I’ve been digging around and calling lots of people and finally got ahold of someone at Honeywell, and they told me point blank “ESS32 has been end of life and support for nearly 10 years. I don't believe I'm going to be able to get you a copy of it.”
 So I’m hoping someone here maybe has a copy of it somewhere. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project that i am setting up some new servers with security baselines using DSC instead of GPOs. That's all good and the systems are getting configured ok.
 1) I can only assume that because these servers are domain joined the users who login carry policies from the OUs they live and that will be applied when the user logs in. Is this correct? Are there any implications if DSC configures the computer and GPO configures the user portion only?
 2) How can i configure restricted groups? Any idea? Do i need to resort to configuring the local groups explicitly instead ?? I am thinking to create a GPO with the restricted groups and try and export it as a baseline then merge is in my DSC config... Just a thought. Has anyone tried something like that?
 3) In case i need to build a standalone server with DSC security baselines only, how am i going to configure any user settings ? Is this possible ?
 3) Is there a loopback analogue in the DSC like the GPO?
 These are pretty much late night thoughts, i am going to crack on in the lab one of these days testing all these however i would like to hear from more experienced sysadmins just in case i save myself a lot of testing time!
 Thanks!

 There is likely going to be a potential opening for a new sysadmin role at my company, my manager is pushing really hard for me to get the promotion due to my previous training in Active Directory and network administration.
 However, we have a hybrid environment and while I've been really good at picking up on how to administer the various technologies we use (Intune, SharePoint, etc)
 Does anyone have any recommendations on certifications or recommended training?
 For background our full environment is hybrid AD/AAD with AD Connect Sync, SharePoint, Exchange, and Intune for MDM/MAM.
 I've been looking at MS-100-101 as our C-Suite is starting to take cyber-security pretty seriously and also AZ-800-801 as well.
 I'm also working on developing my Powershell skills.
 I'm passable at them but want to get much better at using it to make writing automation scripts and tasks easier.
 Any suggestions would be very helpful, sorry if this is posted a lot but I couldn't find anything in the FAQ so I'd figured I'd make a post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm a CS major and have interned as a Software Engineer and Backend developer (modeling, testing and implementing DB's) but to be honest i don't want to develop Applications at all as a fulltime job because that doesn't really seem fulfilling to me. I rather have a direct impact on other Developers and teams / the people around me! 
 I do enjoy programming though, especailly Python to automate things with. I've been reading a little about sysadmin stuff and i do know the basics of bash scripting, know how to get around, use VIM, i've done a Kali linux class that was pretty extensive and have my CCNA from my Networking class in school and most important i quite enjoyed learning all that. 
 What i'm wondering is, are there jobs that kind of mix these things together? Where i can automate things, develop solutions for Developers around me while still leveraging my computer science / coding skills?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody,
 I currently work for a local government outside the US with a relatively small IT department. I am currently the teammember with the longest employment with just 17 months working here. It was (and still is) a wild ride.
 We currently face the challenge, that our core-switches and a lot of our network switches are extremly old. We also have two networks (one for the city government and one for the schools of the city) with different brands of switches that run together on a single core-switch each. The core-switches are not redundant. It's a bit of a mess.
 One network is currently running on Nortel and Extreme switches, the other one is mainly Aruba and HP. We also use Aruba for our WIFI.
 Out goal is to replace both core-switches, and make both networks run redundantly over both core-switches (still seperated via VLANs). Also, currently nearly all our routing is done by the core-switches instead of the firewall. We want to change that as well.
 We also have to replace a huge amount of our switches over the next year or two. Here we want to choose one brand for both networks, that we stick with in the future.
 Now I am not very deep into the networking side of things (yet). I am normaly more of a sysadmin. That's why I wanted to ask you guys for some recommendations on how to approach this.
 What brands of switch-manifacturers would you recommend? What technologies should I look out for? What should I avoid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding of SASE is that clients install an agent that tunnels up to the SASE provider’s cloud, and routes all outbound traffic via this tunnel, where it goes through the provider’s Firewall in said cloud instance, and then egresses from there. To access on-prem company resources, a light weight connector VM is dropped somewhere in the datacenter that tunnels up to the same SASE provider cloud, and acts as a proxy of sorts.
 In theory this eliminates remote access vpn full tunneling into your network.. remote users no longer get a routable IP that can be reached from on-prem, meaning they also can’t reach on-prem resources unless it’s via the “connector” and that can be locked down according to your heart’s content.. meanwhile all traffic destined outside of your network has the benefit of being secured by this cloud firewall.
 My question is, have any of you transitioned to a solution like this as a full-on replacement to traditional remote access vpn? What was your driver in doing so? (Checking a box for zero trust strategy? Eliminating the overhead of managing the remote access vpn infrastructure? (Patching appliances, renewing certificates, keeping client software version current, etc). Because a case study showed this was genuinely more secure than a traditional remote access vpn?)
 My other question os what are the shortcomings? Issues encountered, etc? I’m already thinking of an interactive app we use in our network that probably won’t work with this, since it establishes old school RTP sessions to endpoints.. so any stateful device sees two different sessions, one from endpoint, one to endpoint… I’m skeptical this will successfully traverse the “connector” proxy..
 Any other thoughts? Is this just another marketing fad and it’s really just over glorified “cloud firewall?” Or is this pretty much the future? Maybe I’m completely missing the point on what SASE actually is and why it is? I’m eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on this!

How are spammers and attackers in a CGNAT network traced or identified?
 
Do the Internet providers of the networks keep track of the traffic from each individual user, or just the traffic that is generated inside the CGNAT network as a whole.
 
 The ISP’s haven’t been really helpful, since most of their helpdesk employees aren’t very tech savvy. Thank you in advance :)

The program runs fine when we launch it on workstations within our main building using a batch command that calls the program through a shared drive. However, we're running into issues when we try to launch the program on remote hosts outside of our second building and over VPN.
 When we run the batch command in these situations, we can see active connections to the server over SMB, but the program doesn't actually launch on the remote host. It's as if the Java connection isn't going over the WAN/VPN. We've already reached out to our network team, server team, and the vendor, but nobody has been able to provide a solution yet.
 We've checked our firewall settings, network settings, and DNS settings, but haven't found any issues there. We've also tried running the program directly on the remote host, but that didn't work either.
 Any ideas?

 Have any (or all) of you experienced the pain of being forced to implement a system due to poor research, lack of communication, lack of knowledge, and just not understanding the existing systems implementation by a top level manager?
 How did you deal with it? I'm so tired of having to remind people who should know better that, in this day and age (old man yells at cloud), all major businesses are IT focused. Everything that deals with communications, advertising, data processing, analytics, word processing, email, all of the business rules, are related, if not directly under, technology. The business is an IT company providing services through technology.
 If anything tech related goes south fast, money stops flowing. 
 Communications? Lost money. Email down? Lost money. Shitty business rules? Lost money. Bad system purchases? Lost money.
 When will it be common knowledge that everything in a business relies on IT, infrastructure, database management, networking, backups, yadda yadda yadda.
 To the VPs who make 3 times as much as the poor bastards being forced to make a square peg fit in a round hole, being told that "well others are doing it, you just need to learn", being pulled in 15 directions because your word document emergency is more important than project progress: the business is an IT business that provides a market service. All of it. 
 Thinking of trying to integrate a sweet, shiny, and slick constant contact suite? IT
 New company policy that affects payments? Include IT
 Considering purchasing new monitors? Include IT
 Key cards? Include IT
 Entire systems? Include IT
 Reporting software? Include IT
 New building? Include IT

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey crew,
 I read a post on here a while back asking how one can reasonably use Power Apps to help alleviate some IT admin tasks, where one specific request was how to create new users with Power Apps. Since I was learning Power Apps development anyway, I took it upon myself to do create a "User Administration" app, so that HR for example could create new users and assign them to groups, without help from the IT department. I now hate Power Apps and Microsoft and my life. 
 Power Apps is clunky, tedious to develop in, and the licensing makes neither logical nor business sense when one realizes that all the "good" features are premium and Power Apps for Teams is the cut-rate model.
 All my bitching aside, the app is done, and I have thoroughly documented (no bullshit YouTube videos, I promise) the process of:
  
Creating an App using the free built-in connectors to MS365/Azure AD
 Realizing that these connectors won't cut it and redoing everything with premium connectors
 Getting the app finished and ready for y'all to download
  
I hope y'all find my experience or app helpful and if you would like to try to implement something like this in production, please let me know, and I will help if I can. Thanks r/sysadmin, my favorite, commiserating subreddit!

 Few months back we had an urgent ticket come in, estates had installed some expensive new building management (BMS) kit and now needed all the sensors networked in, some in really funky locations - think underground access conduits and roof spaces. Obviously without any heads up to IT. Not a simple fix, and thus it's one of those calls that emails start getting cc'd to directors and people are getting angry.
 So we run with it and design where we need to run new fibre, what devices we will place where, well documented and scope done, but because of the complications in this work (think drilling a couple of 6" reinforced concrete walls that are both firestops and holding up a 5 story building above) we pass back the documents to estates (who have qualified surveyors) and say can you can you please manage and implement.
 That was 6 months ago and nothing happened.
 Doesn't bother me, not my issue if project happens or not, but the underlying issue is just the expectations people have outside of IT, but never expect the same elsewhere.
 Off to make a coffee.

Walked in today (03/21) and no emails were working - program that was downloaded on users computer to automatically convert Outlook profiles didn’t work. My first ever time doing it - Office 2019 we just had to restart a few hundred computers and the program would pop up to configure the profile (not suppose to require a restart anyways) Office 2016 users we had to apply latest patch, then restart and the program would work to configure new profile. I’ve been having to tell people to use the OWA until I can get to them. Then found out that Microsoft is having 365 admin issues on top of it. I did not think it would be this hard. All this is a hit or miss operation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. Last year I got a new job as IT Specialist for an engineer company that has grown at an incredibly fast pace in recent years. The biggest problem I’m facing right now is that there is no central management for our endpoints and nobody seems to care: the general mentality in many respects has remained that of the family business.
 Since the company is constantly growing, now we have more than 250 endpoits to manage without an MDM, and most employees have the possibility to work remotely 2 days a week.
 We have mainly Windows 10-11 PCs, a couple of Macs, a dozen iPads and 70 Android phones.
 Is there a way to manage this all in some MDM with software management? 
 I looked into intune/endpoint manager since we are already using Microsoft 365 services with hybrid Azure AD join.
 I also need to deploy Autodesk apps (such as Autocad and Revit) on 40% of the Windows devices, and I was wondering if there is an MDM that is better suited for this task.
 Thanks in advance for your help.

 My end goal is to get users logging in with a single set of credentials for their computer and o365 logins and allowing automatic login of their OneDrive and Microsoft Office programs. I already know I need to setup password write back.
 I’m looking for best practices and any guides that will help me along the journey of enabling AD sync between this on prem .local domain and our Azure AD counterpart. Of course, I’d like it to go as smoothly as possible.
 Once the domains are synchronised, how does it deal with those users who have different attributes. For example, if a local domain user is showing as in department A, and the O365 user with the same username is in department B, which department wins?

 Oh there is one more details - why can other Windows clients on the network see our old QNAP servers, despite both being in completely different subnets?
 Oh and lastly I know the Windows clients can add them via IP of course. But I'd rather not do that in-case the IP changes, as well as other reasons like making it easier for people to identify servers.
 Or is there a better way to handle this?

Microsoft Server 2019 - 192.168.5.10 (This will also be the Gateway)
 Windows 11 For Server Access - 192.168.5.20
 Windows 11 for General Client Use (here's where "or more" come into play, there may be many clients, all of which should see the same user experience.) - 192.168.5.30
  
I can set up these three in Hyper-V such that they'll ping each other, and that I can map a network drive from the Win11 Server Access PC to view the contents on C:\ of the Server 2019. I will be setting up an Internal Switch for this.
 My Client General Use Computers, lets say I wanted to block www.latimes.com (just picking a site, nothing against LA Times), how can I network my computers, such that my Client Computers won't be able to access this website?
 The question is not, how do apply the block. I'll get to that later.
 Which one of these PCs actually accesses the Internet for that client? Is it #1, #2 or #3? I need that process explained to me and how to network it properly, or at the very least, a link that explains it well for a beginner.
 I am comfortable using Command Prompt, even more comfortable with Powershell (preferred)

Are there any books or other sources out there that I can use to bring these people in line with modern times? I can't spoon feed them everything myself. They have been successfully managing their legacy systems for 20 years, but we need a change, and I would prefer to not have that change involve getting rid of them.
 These are people who have never heard of ansible or rundeck and who cut their teeth on solaris.
 I'm looking for something like "automation 101" that talks about new methods of doing things and the modern way to manage IT, and has a pets vs cattle discussion.

 I am at a smaller fiber ISP. We are trying to figure out the best way to calculate our network availability/reliability percentage for when subscribers or businesses ask.
 What scope would we use to define our availability? Entire network outages where no subscribers have access? Would we calculate for all nodes then average them?
 We have small outages all the time from fiber damage so would we count every single one of those?
 What should be included or excluded? Any thoughts would be great.

Would be working as part of a team, primarily managing and maintaining systems in their data center, managing O365/AzureAD, assisting with escalated tickets, and I'm sure a ton more.
 I'm currently an Azure Admin for a large MSP, and have been for a little over 2 years now, this job will require me to move back into an on-premise environment and learn VMWare. I'm not opposed to this, but just not sure if it would be a step-down, and I certainly would miss Azure. Job is hybrid, 2–3 days a week in office, I'm currently fully remote. Would be a 15% percent raise.
 Have a slight obsession with theme parks/roller coasters, so I do think this would be a cool position to have, with some opportunity to assist with system and network design for ride operations + the park in general.
 Anyone ever worked IT in the amusement industry? How bad is it?

 Am I the only one that feels this network latency requirement is unrealistic? I'm currently attaining values ~0.700ms, even between VMs on different hosts. I barely get sub-0.500ms response times between 2 Cisco network switches with a 100Gb interconnect.

 Similarly, can I force that behavior (to not repeat) if I'm using the 'Task Subject' instead of the normal Subject field?

 I know I can pull the xml configs of the firewall/NAT rules off pfsense but trying to figure out a good tool in order to parse that and visualize it.
 Our ISSO wants to have something in order to review and see which systems have outside connections coming in to them from the internet and over what ports.
 They asked us to look into Redseal, which seems to be capable of doing this but comes with a $60k price tag to it, which is way too high for what little we need it to do.
 We do not need a SIEM, Vuln scanner, CIS/SCAP benchmark tool, SOC analytics or anything else Redseal seems to offer. 
 Anyone have any suggestions? I haven't used python before to parse xml and visualize it into something but i'm sure it's been done before or there's something like this...somewhere lol. Just not sure where!

Several times, and with several different versions, we have been getting our Fortigate firewalls' virus scanning getting tripped by direct-from-Cisco IOS-XE downloads (specifically, 17.3.7, 17.6.4, and 17.6.5 for various sizes of 9800 WLCs and the 9300 switches) for "W32/MalformedType.PE!dam". 
 Fortinet insists that this is damaged malware according to their website, but - having pulled it down to a VM and scanned it with several tools and run a checksum on it - is absolutely a match for what Cisco lists for SHA512 checksum and comes back clean.
 I'm expecting to need to do battle with the InfoSec dragon on Monday, and I'd like to find out if anyone else is seeing this (or has seen similar in the past). I'm expecting it's a false positive on Fortinet's part given nothing else has tripped on scans, but certain individuals on the InfoSec team can be somewhat stubborn, and I can't choose who to go to on this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a sysadmin, but I handle some tickets for a lot of low-level items on the business side. Usually one ticket with many low-level items, i.e. 5 low-level items, one ticket. These low-level items are essentially different workstreams that can be blocked based on another user. Essentially, there are cases where 3 low-level items are cleared, but we still have 2 remaining, so the ticket isn't closed on our side. This causes a never-ending build-up. 
 Seeing as this sub probably deals with tickets, I wanted to see if there's an efficient way to deal with this. I can't play cat and mouse with the users forever, going into each ticket and firing off email reminders to clear their item, so I can clear mine. I also can't police the users to only have 1 item per ticket, it's not feasible.
 The only thing I can think about to combat this is to track these items at the lowest level in Excel, then automate a weekly reminder via Power Automate. Is this the right approach, something better out there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably just a misunderstanding of mine as to how group policy works, but I can't wrap my head why the order of precedence for group policies in our environment is the way it is. Apologies for the shit title.
 We have a group policy for MS Office that is being enforced at the domain level. There are a couple settings in there that I think are currently breaking some things, so I applied a test group policy with the opposite configurations to a test OU where I've placed a few computers. 
 My understanding is that the group policy should apply in the order of local -> site -> domain > OU. So even though I have the test group policy applied at the test OU the computer resides in, when I check inheritance for the test OU, the MS Office policy is taking precedence over my test policy, even after enforcing my test policy. Office policy is like #11 in the list of precedence whereas mine is in the mid 30s. 
 The inheritance seems to have everything at domain/site above the OU policy, which is contrapositive to what I thought I knew about GP. 
 What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 My time has finally come to post here! I am seeking advice on how I should approach the following situation:
 Recently, I was offered two separate administration positions. Unfortunately, both of them are solo admins, meaning I would be the only "IT" person on site. This worries me due to my limited experience..
 For some background, I am graduating with a CS degree in less than a month, and have been working at a tier 1 IT helpdesk the past two years, and I feel like I am not ready to move into this admin position because of the lack of guidance.
 I would say I have intermediate knowledge in Networking, scripting, and virtualization topics, but have very beginner level knowledge in administration.
 What should I do??
 ​
 Edit:
 If anyone has some resources for anything administration related, I would be grateful if you shared with me :)
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For days we've had this issue of folder redirection breaking 10 or so minutes after users logged in. It started with one user, then two, and soon it became a large handful. Multiple engineers were baffled and threw in the towel.
 Today, I sat down and was determined to figure it out. After 4 hours of analysing event logs and intense Googling, I got it; the file server IP and hostname don't match in DNS. 
 The previous tech managing this environment before my company took over had no idea what he was doing. Because of this, there are configurations that at best make no sense, and at worst are dangerous. In this case, the file server had a static IP that's inside a DHCP range, so a client took over its IP causing the mismatch.
 Releasing the IP, extending the exclusion range and recreating the server's A record fixed the issue. I know there are other ways of sorting it, but with the random exclusion ranges already present, this was the safest option.
 It's Friday, I've had a long week, and this took the last bit of energy I had, but man do I feel powerful for figuring it out! 
 Just wanted to share this little victory. Have a good weekend guys.

 I’m afraid I know the answer to this but I need to ask just so I can go home for the weekend knowing I asked:
 I’m trying to Install an ARM MSI from GPO (that enough initials for everyone?). When I try to add the MSI I get “Unable to deploy package. The package does not support a Windows compatible platform.” I assume it’s because the server is an x64. I’m trying to deploy settings for some machines running Win11 on M1 Macs in Parallels, and other settings so far are ok. I figured this would be too since the GPO just points the client to the MSI on the network, and it doesn’t actually need to run on the server, but I guess it doesn’t like that it’s an ARM package.
 There’s not some magical checkbox or setting buried somewhere I’m missing to get around this, is there? The x64 version of the same installer works fine.
 Thanks.

 I am brand new in IT and got a job as a system admin/IT helpdesk. I am the only one so I need to wear a lot of hats. Recently we got 4 new wireless access points (Aruba ap 505) for the warehouse and I have gotten them theoretically connected to the internet. They are wired and connected to a network switch (Aruba 1930) which is being tethered off another switch. All of the access points are connected to these switches and all 11 that were already here are working perfectly and everything is connected to the same network. I can not get the new access points to connect to the Aruba virtual controller. I add the MAC addresses, a checksum error pops up for a couple seconds then goes away. At this point there are no errors showing but the AP's stay red and don't seem to connect to the mesh configuration.
 What do I need to do to get these to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently supporting an office network of about 1500 wireless clients. The hardware for this network is 100% Meraki, MX250 as the firewall, MS425 for core, MS225 for access, and mainly MR46 for wireless. (80 APs over 4 floors)
 Recently we started getting more complains about the WIFI network, and the complaints are always random:
  
It takes too long to connect
 Disconnects often
 Video meetings sometimes hang
  
​
 I will go to the user's laptop and everything is working fine. The Meraki logs do not show much helpful information.
 ​
 I took a packet capture on my PC after working hours and I found a very high amount of multicast traffic. The capture was for 22 seconds and 63% of all packets were MDNS from other Mac devices in the network (1600 packets) and this is after working hours.
 ​
 Meraki has an option at the switch level to Enable or Disable "Flood unknown multicast traffic". Currently, we have it as "enabled" and I am not sure what it could break if I put it in "Disabled".
 ​
 Are you guys blocking multicast traffic in large WIFI deployments? What is your approach to this?

 Set up power automate flow:
 Send Email to shared mailbox "hello, we are determining if this mailbox is in use or not, please response yes / no Yes(requires business justification and your name etc)
 ​
 If yes -> log response in sharepoint list
 If no -> log response in sharepoint list, marked for deletion etc

 I was having some wrist pains, due to my old chairs arm rests not being in line with my desk, and my wrists being at awful angle. New chair fixed my wrist pain, but the lumbar support is awful in it. I sat in the chair, for at least 30 minutes before buying, first 3 days this week where good. However, Thursday and today my lower back is in pain. It’s not even 11AM today, and my lower back hurts already.
 I was hoping to return it, and replace it with something better. I know Herman Millers/Steelcase are expensive, but I need something that’s better supporting.
 In anyone’s experience, are those chairs worth the $$$$$? My biggest ask in another new chair are, adjustable arm rests, good lumbar support, comfortable for all day work.
 Thanks for your recommendations!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 I have been given the greenlight to start the automation journey for our current organization and go from zero network automation to hero. It is a mix of brownfield for our current devices and any future deployments can be considered greenfield.
 There is a TON of resources out there on how to use all of the network automation tools/frameworks but not much information on common pitfalls and how to properly scale the network automation operation so it doesn't blow up in your face.
 So my question to folks who have been down this journey.
  
Can you describe your current workflow?
 What does the lifecycle of provisioning a brand new device look like ?
 How do you handle network changes such as adding a new VLAN to a switch and keeping the source of truth/variables updated with this information?
 Are you constantly polling the device and comparing it to the intended state? How are you handling a mismatch from the intended vs what is on the device ?
 Are you pushing changes made in the source of truth to the device in your workflow?
 How are you handling multiple sources of truth ? 
  
I'm aware this is really dependent on the tools/skills available to the organization, hoping to get some inspiration and ideas how other orgs are doing their automation.
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as I'm reading this release/heads-up from MS about them turning on MFA as the security default in our/everyone's tenant in a couple of weeks, I'm a little concerned.
 I fully understand why they are doing it as a default - just the "right" security policy and takes (some) of the liability off of their plate. However, MFA will just simply not work for a lot of our staff. The bulk of our staff don't need multifactor to just open their email. Half of them can't even have their phones out at their desks due to client requirements nor do they have any ability to access email/system outside of the office itself.
 I'm by no means a "system admin" (more of a jack of all trades but master of none) but I'm the version of that in our office. I'm assuming that I can reverse this new default setting when MS flips the switch so we stay how we currently are set up - those that require remote access have MFA and those that do require remote access do not have MFA.
 Any help/direction you can provide will help settle my nerves. 
 Thanks.

It's been on an Intel NUC, which has shown its age and is a bit noisy when the fan is going. I figured I'd upgrade and found a fanless thin client, an HP T620, for cheap. I figured I could just set it in write mode, install the programs I needed, then disable write mode and have it get going. Only issue is that in write mode, it only exposes about 250mb of C: - not enough for OBS and storing music. 
 I can't for the life of me find HP documentation on the T620 - everything seems to be a dead link. Is there any guide or documentation that people know of on how I can enable writes to the full 64gb storage capacity? Last time I did this, I was sysadminning a Citrix Xendesktop environment, and I used Citrix's console to create image versions as VHDs, cracked them open in Hyper-V, made my changes, and merged them in for the thin clients to boot to the image, but this is at drastically smaller scale and scope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has around 18TB of legal hold data we've gathered over the years that we cannot delete yet.
 The data: * Is stored on-site on an older Netapp we want to get rid of * Consists of exported PST's, network drive folders, and Windows PC HDD images
 The same senior people tend to get looped into multiple cases, so all of this data duplicates in half down to 9TB on disk with Netapp's deduplication.
 We want to move the data off the Netapp and securely store it in the cloud somewhere. The data is very rarely read. I would prefer to be able to keep a copy on site, but we'd need to purchase some new storage to accommodate for that.
 Any recommendations on inexpensive hardware (not a custom build, needs ~NBD coverage) for storing this data on-site and for services to securely store this data in the cloud?

 I'm looking for a way to monitor an internal SMTP mail server 
 been trying to do this with a powershell command but its not exactly working as i like
 I was thinking maybe there's some type of service or local agent that can install to monitor this
 I basically want to be alerted if the mail flow for a specific account is not working connected to this internal relay 
 the relay is available only internally so I can't use an external service to monitor the specific IP and port
 Ideas?
 Thx

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/sysadmin community!
 I'd like to share with you a project I've been working on, called NetAtlas C2 Server Search. It's a Java-based utility designed to detect Command and Control (C2) servers using the Netlas API. The tool offers a simple and user-friendly CLI interface for searching C2 servers, leveraging the Netlas API to gather data and process it locally.
 ![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/Q0g0ego8SK97elJvTHN5IXLzs.svg)
 To get started, you'll need a Netlas API key, which you can obtain from the Netlas website. Once you have your API key, you can use the c2detect command to search for servers:
 bash c2detect -t <TARGET_DOMAIN> -p <TARGET_PORT> -s <API_KEY> [-v] 
 This project is available on GitHub, and you can find the full README file with detailed usage instructions, Docker support, and a list of supported C2 servers there.
 If you'd like to contribute or have any feedback, please feel free to create a pull request or leave a comment. I hope you find this tool helpful in your sysadmin tasks!
 Happy hunting!

 we have a lot of devices that are registered several times in azure with the same device/computer name.
 Basically I think that every time someone else logs onto that computers and uses office 365 with their account it's creating a new device in Azure...
 I'm fairly sure that's not how it's supposed to be, because it's called "device" and not "device/user link".
 I have found a particular device that's 16 times in azure...
 we have more than 1300 "stale devices" because of this.
 Does anyone has any insight of to prevent this and/or why this is happening ?

 I have a RDP certificates deployed from an Root CA with now invalid OCSP location in the AIA. Connecting to every hosts now takes obviously more to check the invalid OCSP address. I would deploy additional valid RDP certificates, but I am unsure how it handles both certificates. If I am correct, then it won't bother to check expired certs.
 But would it check all RDP certs if they are not expired and then of course still complain about the invalid OCSP?
 I would hope that it somehow is satisfied with one completely valid RDP cert.
 With RDP certificate I mean a certificate with enhanced key usage of value "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.54.1.2"

 I have two buildings around 300ft apart and have 2 separate systems that need connectivity between the buildings.
 Each of the 2 systems is provided by a different vendor. They each have provided a pre-configured router that gets installed at building A, and each have provided a pre-configured WiFi AP that gets installed at building B. Each vendor has also supplied gear for a point-to-point WiFi bridge.
 I can’t avoid having the 2 routers or the 2 WiFi AP’s due to the preconfigured nature, but is there a way I can avoid having the 2 point-to-point links and use a single point to point link instead?
 I’m thinking I would need a managed switch at each end, setup VLANs, and connect the point-to-point equipment to a trunk port on the switches.
 Open to suggestions!

 We were buying Vostro laptops during the shortages and we'd send so many back within a few months. Poor quality hinge connection on the lids, keyboard and trackpad issues, audio device failure (happened to at least 10 machines), camera failure, and so on. And even the ones that survived are slowly dying
 But the Latitude machines still seemed to be good. We'd never sent one back, and the only warranty claim we'd made was for a failed hard drive many years ago. Fast forward to today and I've now had to have two Latitude laptops repaired, one needed a motherboard replacement before I even had it deployed, and another was deployed for a week before the charger jack mysteriously stopped working

 I lately encountered an installer and software that is signed with an Apple certificate. As our windows installation does not trust the root certificate, the application is blocked by applocker.
 I'm wondering if I'm missing something. Is this certificate supposed to be trusted on windows computers? Should I add an apple root and intermediate certs to our windows clients? Is this the new normal for application developers to sign their executables with?

 I was thinking of setting up a locally hosted dashboard that would replace the homepage (which is just set to the company website) where there would be "bookmarks" that takes you to notable items within the company like: ERP login, SharePoint, Office, Homepage, etc.. limitless potential. You could ask yourself why not just have standard bookmarks, but my response to that is; this would be cooler.
 As this would be locally there is the problem that while not connected to the local infrastructure or VPN it would not necessarily work, there might be a way to throw in a failsafe somewhere that just redirects to the homepage or something, i have not thought that far yet.
 So please Tech people of reddit, is this the most idiotic idea you have heard or is it a cool/semi good idea?
 Thanks for your response

Some password managers allow sharing, but the person would need to create a user.
 What are some of the super dooper secure authentication workflows you can dream up?
 For instance, I don't know there voice so before I share, I'll ask them what the asset tag is on the laptop to make sure there are really in front of it.

 An infrastructure engineer was bumped up to IT Team Manager, as well as several duties that the now non-existant Director of IT and Security did as well as QA tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I'm a seasoned unix and network administrator with 30 years experience, I'm not into global internetworking and I don't really want to be, normally I don't care what happens after the default route my ISP gives me, but I now suddenly have to and the more I read about BGP, ASNs etc, the more confused I am, so please bear with me ;)
 We are a relatively small company whose managed hoster of 15 years just terminated the contract ("We no longer fit into their business model", I guess they couldn't bullshit enough money out of us, but anyway, irrelevant...) , so now I have ended up with a bunch of IP ranges (smaller than /24, so I can't take them with me) entered into dozens of firewalls either as ACLs or as IPSec VPN endpoints, that I now have to change, and all of which are in big enterprises where changes take weeks, if not months to push through the middle management layer.
 OK, I'll have to go through all the pain and renumber once, but how do I prevent not to have to do it again if or when similar thing happens again? The scenario would be that when moving between hosters, I would duplicate the environment (i.e. firewalls) and then just flip the route announcements and the traffic switches within minutes and If I did everything correctly I do not have to do anything on the customer side. How realistic is this expectation?
 Do I need an ASN to fully own an IP range? In RIPE requirements (we are in the EU) it says you have to be multihomed to get one, but we are nothing yet as we haven't picked the new hoster yet ;) Or am I doing things in the wrong order, first I have to pick a hoster and then get the range. What do I have to ask the potential hosting candidates to be sure the plan is going to work? How does one own an IP range, is it tied to a person, organization, ASN? How does one move it around between hosters?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a fleet of Dell WD19TB docks with the USB-C cable connectors and there are more than a few that the plastic casing has split (through repetitious plugging/unplugging) and won't click back together. I just need something simple to hold them together for regular use and tiny, thick (wide) rubber bands come to mind but I can't seem to phrase what I'm looking for quite right for the googles to assist me. Insights are appreciated.
 Edit: To clarify, we’re a single device laptop shop so staff plug and unplug several times a week as they take laptops home or bring them onsite (we’re hybrid). Ideally the solution would be somewhat aesthetically pleasing but effective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a growing healthcare company, recently expanding from 200 users to 350 users in the past couple of years. Up until now we have had a small IT department consisting of four techs who share all responsibilities, from help desk to equipment installs to device configurations to facilities work and vendor support.
 It has been increasingly difficult to manage projects and maintain our infrastructure due to how many hats we wear, the lack of staffing, and the constant interruptions of day to day issues. This has led to us experiencing a cyber attack and the loss of two of our staff due to burnout and the inability to keep up. 
 The company has managed to bounce back, but I am not seeing any signs of slowing down and we are still meagerly staffed and I can sense another implosion on the horizon. 
 But I’m getting too far ahead of myself. I guess my main question is - how do we structure our IT department as a growing company to assure we are staffed and handling issues correctly? I know we are going to need dedicated help desk staff, network technician, security officer, applications support, a manager, a sys admin, etc. - but what are the actual standards for a company from 300-500 employees? Is four IT staff enough? And what roles should they be divided into?
 I feel we are not organized and divided and staffed correctly, and since our current IT manager has zero IT knowledge, I want to see if I can gather some ideas to float up to higher management to get us the help we need before something major happens again due to lack of coverage/support and high burnout.

 I use RealVNC for remote access to computers around the house. It's free and works great.
 The two I would like to use the most at home is Auvik (network discovery, mapping, and built-in console/ssh) and ITGlue (device documention). I currently use nothing similar to Auvik and a simple Excel spreadsheet for device models, serial numbers, warranties, and similar.
 I'm considering using AssetTiger for documenting devices, but curious if there's anything else out there that would work better. I'm ok with self hosted as well!

The cut sheet has no tunnel IPs but when I asked I was referred to the cut sheet. I assumed this meant that I am to use an IP in a provided /28. 
 I went ahead with the configuration, created the requisite proposal, policy, keyring, profiles (one for ikev2, one for ipsec), and transform-set. I also configured a tunnel interface and assigned an IP and the aforementioned range. That didn't work so I tried the next, then another, and another. No luck.
 So I asked for a meeting with the third party. Expressed my concern about not having an IP address to assign to the tunnel, it was met with "well your NAT IPs...." and he lost me. 
 I'm not sure if it's my ignorance or his, but I don't know what to ask or Google at this point. I have read several configuration guides, all referencing an IP assigned to the tunnel. I opened a TAC case and reviewed my configuration with the engineer, their determination, you need an IP assigned to the tunnel. 
 My question for the group, have you ever seen a configuration like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 Tl;Dr what is your time management strategy?
 I'm a recent sysadmin supervisor after over a decade in service desk management plus a year as a sysad, and I'm struggling to juggle everything that needs to get done. I'm hoping to get some sage advice. 
 I am working for a company that had a 3-man IT department two years ago but experienced rapid growth and are now up to 15 IT folks for 200 end users. There's a lot that needs to get done. We're taking this place from a ma and pa shop to an enterprise-level IT environment from the ground up, and need to do it quickly due to auditing requirements. 
 I've been working 12+ hour days every day without a break other than rushing to the restroom, and it's still not enough. My calendar is booked in 15 minute increments for 2-3 weeks out at all times, with more being dropped on my lap every day. My two sysads are junior-level and struggle with most items, so I have to dedicate at least an hour every day to get them in a position to tackle their responsibilities.
 I average 6 meetings a day (my team, my boss, other IT departments, project managers, and vendors), plus project work, ticket escalations, emergency vulnerabilities, and any other random stuff that pops up. I'm stressed. My team is stressed. They keep threatening to quit and so I spend my lunch break every day helping them organize and prioritize and try to make sure they have everything they need. 
 I started meeting every 2 weeks with the CTO and my boss to adjust priorities as needed, but it has only helped me to meet due dates rather than be chronically late. He says that they don't have the budget to hire another sysad right now. 
 Finding another job isn't an option - I tried, and after applying to nearly 100 jobs I only received two offers for 20k less than I'm making now.
 Please help me. I'm at the end of my rope here. How do you do it? What's the secret?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's up, y'all?
 We're moving from on-prem server room to DC colo. We have a modest video distribution business with respectable storage and connectivity needs. Part of this move is scaling up, including storage, transcoding capacity and (tada) connectivity.
 We have a legacy FC network connected to a legacy SAN. The rest of the LAN runs on 1GbE. The LAN is upgraded to 25/100G.
 Our internet connectivity has been 1Gbps and we've been saturating it regularly. Looking to move up to 10Gbps in the colo. We average about 50TB of traffic in/out with our current firewall and connectivity. We won't have many users on this new network, primarily receiving file-based video, processing, and sending file-based deliverables out to endpoints.
 We're upgrading our entire networking stack with a life of at least 5 years before revisiting.
 Our new network build is:
  
Supermicro NAS with Mellanox Connectx-5 2x 100G ports
 Supermicro Top of Rack Switch with 48 x 25G SFP28 and 6 x 100G QSFP28
 Mellanox 25G x 2 cards on the transcoders, workstations, and distribution server back to the switch
  
The LAN side is pretty much done, but we're looking for firewall options that will offer at least 10G on the LAN to come up from our core switch and 10G on the WAN to fully utilize contracted bandwidth.
 We've considered building out our own box, but prefer to have an appliance with commercial support.
 We've looked at products from these vendors:
  
FortiNet (100F)
 Ubiquiti
 Netgate
 Mikrotik
  
These vendors seem to offer solutions within our budget (medium enterprise with good feature sets). Would appreciate some firewall recommendations from these vendors, to compare with what we've evaluated, and any others that we may not be considering that would fit.
 Thanks!

 And my nameservers are set up correctly, pointing to the domains that Cloudflare gave me
 Did I fucked something up when deleting the records? If so, I can't tell what's wrong.
 Sorry for asking for help, but really IDK where else to ask for something like this
 And no, I am not hosting any kind of prohibited content, it's just CNAMEs pointing to docs of some projects of mine and for a few web apps (with API)
 EDIT: FIXED IT!!
 I had a loop in SSL redirects, like the browser requests in HTTPS to Cloudflare, Cloudflare turns into HTTP and forwards the request to my hosting, the hosting tries to force HTTPS by redirecting back to HTTPS and so the loops continues. I just had to go into SSL/TLS (on the Cloudflare panel) and change from Flexible to Full.
 This loop probably was crashing the websites that track propagation

 Turns out, he doesn't like how I take his emails, which are usually shotgun brain dumps with a bunch of different points, questions, ect all mixed together, and split them up into individual points, and denote my responses to each point in red.
 I guess red is too aggressive of a color.
 I'm sorry. I work in an industry where clear communication is vital. I really don't care how colors make you feel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network traffic security Traffic goes from the gateway to Azure Relay to the Power BI backend cluster. This traffic doesn't traverse the public internet. All Azure internal traffic goes over the Azure backbone.
 Context: So we have an on premises DB which we are going to connect to Power BI cloud service. The connection is going to be established by placing MS on-premises data gateway app on a Windows server on our network. The on premises data gateway app will establish an outbound connection via 443 with Azure relay which further connects to Power BI cloud service. The above statement is from their doc. It is essentially mentioned that the traffic will not traverse public internet. But how could that be possible? Because Azure relay is in in an Azure region and on premises data gateway is in our DC. Wouldn’t the traffic between them go through the internet via 443? Are they mentioning that Azure internal traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet and makes use of Azure backbone? I’m really having a hard time wrapping my head around this. Can someone please explain the traffic flow in this scenario. I’ll be highly indebted to you for explaining this. I do however understand that traffic will be encrypted from gateway to Azure relay but will it be over the internet? Or how does it work. They say this traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet. But relay is in azure and gateway is in our network :(
 Below is the doc link:

 I am in the process of replacing about 30 Cisco routers that are EoL with newer routers. When I ssh to them and do a show run, some of these routers do not have IP domain-name (domain) in the config, but ssh is still working. IoS versions vary. Is there a command that disables a domain-name from having to be configured prior to generating the rsa keys using the crypto key generate rsa modulus command?

 Since receiving that chassis, Aruba has discontinued the V1 chassis and cancelled the outstanding items in our order. 
 They are suggesting we order a 6405 v2 chassis to vsf pair with the first chassis.
 Has anyone built a VSF stack of 6405 or 6410 chassis with 1x V1 chassis and 1x v2 chassis? Has anyone tried/tested ISSU with this configuration?
 I feel like this is too guinea pig of a scenario to want to put into production. Having a mix of different chassis versions in a VSF cluster seems like I'm asking to be bug-testing for the duration of this lifecycle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some background, we currently have to ADs as we are migrating. I will explain more later 
 I have a continuing issue with two users with office and using an application called Aria that work with office
 The ticket came in saying Aria had an error “command is not available” when trying to open a document. When opening office it says the license is inactive up at the top for both users. However for one of them when I had them try to sign in again they get a tpm error. (He has not been in the office so have not done any more troubleshooting with him)
 For the user who wasn’t getting tpm error here’s what I tried -removed account in school/work account setting He was then able to get into office fine. When opening up aria though he was able to open a document, then it would ask for his office email, he entered it, the it would freeze. 
 Now, I am not very familiar with Aria (though I believe this is a problem with office) but sometimes if we have a user log back in in our old domain then open Aria and then log back in our new domain Aria works. (It has to populate in the old domain). I go to do that and I get the same license issue with office(no tpm error) try removing account in school/work account setting, still doesn’t work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, removed local file in app date and the launched again. Still nothing. 
 Last couple of things -version of office is 16.016130.20394 -both users work fine and have no issues on other PCs + verified they have valid licenses. 
 I’ve asked everyone on my team, endless googling and have gotten nowhere. User is getting frustrated so this is my last shot. 
 I’m a new help desk tech so please go easy on me if I’m missing something really dumb. Thanks in advanced for any help

The one hold up is that the wed interface still requires Java and is totally unusable. SSH is fine, but would like the web interface to be accessible as well.
 The switches are currently running a variant of the 14.XX firmware. From what I’ve seen on the Aruba downloads site, there is a 15.XX firmware available for these switches, and it specifically lists the J9299A model as supported in the firmware notes.
 I’m trying to update the switch with this firmware via XMODEM through the console port, but that’s not working like it has on other switches.
 Is there a better way that I should be doing this? Or is there not newer firmware for these switches like I think?
 Thanks for any input!

 I recently deployed this Teams Device as well as a companion touch screen to one of my clients, and after a few hiccups getting the Teams/Zoom firmware working correctly and getting the touchscreen properly paired it seemed to be a pretty nice solution in their conference room.
 Unfortunately, despite my testing without issue one of their primary users is finding the camera in the bar locks up when presenting a PP via her laptop while in a meeting.
 I have not been able to reproduce it myself, and do not have easy access to get hands-on as often as I'd like to.
 Has anyone come across any issues like this with a Yealink device? When the issue occurs it necessitates a complete hard reset of the device. 
 I'm already also working with their support, but they're China based and the time between updates is tedious.
 The firmware on both devices is latest and the Teams app has been recently updated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning all,
 Not sure if this will stay up, but I wanted to ask how you guys deal with having a boss who knows absolutely nothing about IT, and yet makes all of the decisions regarding IT.
 Some background: I work for a small municipal government as 1 of 2 IT techs. We fall under the Finance dept, so the Finance Director (FD) is our boss, and fills the role of IT Director. He knows nothing about IT, and looks at every issue through "cost-goggles" ie. what is the cheapest option and go with that.
 He also doesn't trust either myself or the other IT guy when we tell him information about our systems and what they need. He's extremely micromanaging, to the point that if we change the way the weekly update email is worded, we need to have three meetings with him before we can make the change.
 This is turning more into a rant than a question, but what would you guys recommend we do? I'd love to go to the city manager and say that we need an actual IT Director, but he likely wont listen, and also tell the FD about it, which will make our lives hell. I also can't go to HR, because the HR dept also falls under the FD.
 Any advice is much appreciated, thanks for your time, and have a wonderful Thursday!

 In our experience here, 1 out of 10 of these laptops has problems with that image. So in the past, what we've done is just take any new machines we purchase, format the drives and do a fresh install of the OS with drivers. Then give it to the user.
 However, as we're growing, we're starting to get users in other countries. And it's impractical to order a laptop, (for example) from India, so it complies with export regulations. Ship it here. Format it, and ship it to the user.

 However, now the entire printing process will be eliminated. 
 Because of this, I have been looking for some software (preferably free, of course) that would help with this task. 
 For now, I have only thought of using a PDF editor and putting a "stamps" on it. But maybe there are some better options, so If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them.

 The cause is likely that the clients are connecting to the network through a USB-C dock, and the WiFi connection is being established faster and therefore getting registered with DNS. But shouldn't the DHCP or the client automatically update the entry?

 With an attachment to the HTML, unfortunately I wasn't paying full attention and had already downloaded the html, but I never run it. Then immediately I deleted it again and then I downloaded it again but opened it in vscode and saw code that is fully obfuscated:

 If I try to use https://deobfuscate.io/, I get the following: var jamire = ["warn", "324758BZPRYz", "18MDJMtT"]; so they were probably building some webpage using this obfuscated array.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heres the scenario , small team of 4. I'm on the helpdesk working under the helpdesk lead. Above us is Admin 1 and Admin 2.
 Sysadmin 2 died at my workplace.
 So admin 1 spend a bunch of money to outsources a lot of the security, networking and other maintenance and then tries to spread his projects to me on the helpdesk.
 I really don't want to absorb his projects without compensation and my boss knows this as I explained this to him but he tried to play it off like these projects are easy and don't take much to do and id be getting resume material. Some of them are manageable , as I absorbed handling the security training for our ~400 staff, all aging and in need of basic security knowledge. This alone seems like something worth compensating me for. There are more projects he wants me to do which feels like work i really need to be paid more to do. It requires coordinating with the vendors, purchasing software modules (so far we needed to spend like 12k on software modules for this project....), its expanding our systems capabilities, to me it is really a big project that I basically don't want to do. How do i navigate this fairly? Or what is to be expected here in other workplaces?
 Edit: thank you all for some perspective, my team and i have a good relationship overall. Id be very surprised if they wanted to get rid of me (especially after 1 staff member dying) so i think the best course of action is to rough it out with the project and hopefully secure a promotion in the future.

 People leave I disable their accounts then I want to reclaim the 365 licenses and convert their mailboxes to shared.
 I'm not 100% clear on the exact process I should follow.
 I think it is:
  
"set-remotemailbox "user" -type shared" on the on-prem Exchange
 wait
 once the mailbox shows in 365 as shared remove the 365 licenses
  
But it seems the mailboxes in 365 don't always show as shared as it's been over an hour now and one still shows as user.
 I'm a bit confused whether I need to do any of the steps here?

 I've googled every possible thing that could be added or configured to be blocking the casting to smart tvs from work domain joined laptops.
 I've checked what polices are inside the security settings, specifically for Wireless network (IEEE 802.3) and it is completely empty.
 I've tried opening the TCP and UDP ports that potentially allows Miracast to function.
 I'm still unsure if Miracast is the same thing as just "Cast" feature to any smart device, e.g smart tvs.
 Would love if anyone has an idea what other parts of the firewall Policy to check if it has something I can disable to allow casting?
 Thanks
 P.S* I'm new to the company with far more responsibility than my previous role and looking after the entire business on my own with not much guidance lol.

 I could run metadata cleanup (remove selected server HOSTNAME) but will this totally disconnect it from the domain? I do have a local account but I don't want to lose access to it if it drops off the domain network.
 Edit: looks like it hasn't actually remove the domain services role when I uninstalled it. Attempting again.

 I have a two part question which feels a bit silly but I'm not sure why things have been done this way.
 Microsoft Certificate Authority server has been configured but the web enrolment feature has not been added. Is there any reason why someone would not add this - a potential security risk perhaps? 
 The second question, how do I sign a custom certificate request without the web enrolment? I need a certificate with a specific dns name and also another alternative name, in the past Id create a csr and then sign it using the web enrolment 
 Because everything in my org is now hyper security paranoid I need to say whether having the web enrolment on is a risk and if it is I've no idea how to sign a certificate with custom names (this is all internal)
 Sorry for the clumsy question.

 As this is a production machine with no cold spare drives, my inclination is to use 10 of the drives with RAID 10, which would provide roughly 10TB of usable storage, faster rebuild times, and the ability to tolerate the loss of 1 drive per RAID with a total loss of 2 drives. 
 Additionally, If have two spare drives available to replace any faulty ones due to only using 10 drives in the raid. Alternatively, I could opt for RAID 60, which would offer more usable space and still allow for the loss of 1 drive per RAID, but would result in slower rebuild times.
 What is peoples experience in this ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client with a domain controller running on Windows Server 2016. This system was initially upgraded from an old SBS server which got obviously split into a DC and an Exchange Server. While this worked, it still got us stuck with some old domain scheme (I think it’s 2012 now), some old GPOs, settings and more. After a couple of years we’ve moved them to 365 using a hybrid solution for exchange and azure adconnect syncing the computers and users. 
 We’re now planning on replacing the local physical servers as they’re pretty old and thought about taking the opportunity to replace the DC server with a fresh DC Windows Server 2023, and ditch the old exchange server (which is basically turned off for quite some time now, but not removed). This will finally give us a clean environment with a updated domain schema, no old exchange servers.
 ​
 My biggest concerns are:
  
Keeping the users, data and configurations on O365 and connect it to the new environment.
 
Connecting the rest of the current servers to the new environment.
 
We’re also using Intune so would be nice to keep that working.
 
Keeping the domain name on O365 and local DC.
 
Making the whole transition as smooth as possible.
 
 ​
 Would appreciate any tips and ideas on how to approach this project, I'm sure some of you had to go through something similar. Thanks!

 Mine is small in the long run but reeks of egregious incompetence.
 We have two domain controllers running DHCP, each with two interfaces. Primary DC has 10.x.x.10 and 10.x.x.20 Secondary DC has 10.x.x.11 and 10.x.x.21
 Our Meraki's relay all DHCP discover packets to either the .20 or .21 interface, the rest of the DHCP handshake appears to go out the .10 or .11 interface.
 In this meeting that I was not invited to (I have a network engineering diploma and my CCNA) they decided to perform an audit of these latter two interfaces and decided that they weren't in use and to disable each interface. Obviously when I get in the morning I get a flood of tick…]]></summary>

 Is this normal for this type of position, or any engineering position? I have been asked to take knowledge tests or answer hypothetical situations on how I think, but never introduced to a simulation where I would be quized.

 I shot him down and said it was actually down to the IT guy! If Hammond hadn’t employed his step son Dennis as the only IT guy then the park would not have been shut down and them all escaping. He had too much control by himself. 
 The only lesson is don’t employ family and friends and always instil multi admin with least access privs. I’d love to turn this into an actual case study for getting new business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I was wondering if I could get some assistance or pointed in the right direction with configuring two sonicwall devices as I am not the most familiar with these devices.
 My network is as follows: I have a set of WAPs that go into an unmanaged switch and into a TZ350 (FW1) on X0 to reach the internet. That works just fine. The private network is currently using 192.168.150.0/24
 We are switching ISPs and there is a NSA2700 (FW2) being added as well. Currently going through X15 on this sonicwall works fine as well.
 The issue that I am having is traffic will not want to flow from one interface to another.
 Right now it is WAP -> Switch -> FW1 -> ISP1
 And what I'm trying to do is WAP -> Switch -> X2 on FW1 -> X3 on FW1 -> x15 (DMZ) FW2 -> ISP2.
 I'm running into issues with getting any sort of traffic incoming on X2 to be shot out X3. I asked this question on spiceworks, but the things that were suggested did not seem to work. And one of the responses also seemed to be generated by chatgpt.
 If I can provide any additional information that would be of assistance, please let me know.
 Regards.

 A couple initial challenges are we use multiple MDMs and have multiple companies/locations: (for example, Company A uses AirWatch and Company B uses SOTI for transportation MDM. Company A and Company B both use Ivanti Avalanche for warehouse MDM). Our laptops and computers are currently managed on NAV (an absolute mess from what I've seen). Company B was recently acquired, and this is one note to resolve.
 Is it normal for Support needing to manage both separately (MDM for enrolling/updating, and a HAM for assigning, spare pool, etc)? Is there solutions that can help integrate together?
 We have a SAM tool that specialized in SaaS discovery, complexing licensing, and IT contracts, but doesn't have a HAM function. I'm considered discovery on ServiceNow for this, but I know that system can be a bull in a china shop and may be more than we need. Also like Freshservice's initial offerings.

 At the top of the Enterprise sign up form (which is a Google Form for fuck sake) there is this statement:
  
DISCLAIMER: This is an Enterprise API tier application, which enables continued access to v1.1, v2 and additional Enterprise APIs. Pricing starts at $42,000 / Month based on usage and needs.
  
The digital signage widget only supports the v1.1 API and the basic tier only gives access to v2 as far as I can tell. 
 We also got notification from our web host that they are removing the twitter feed widget from their CMS. Apparently the quote they got from twitter to cover all of their customers would have required them to charge EACH CUSTOMER $10K PER MONTH. To display the last 10 tweets on our website. GTFO.
 Either Elon is actively trying to destroy twitter or he's so out of touch that he thinks companies are going to pay what amounts to extortion.
 I thought the whole purpose of charging for API access was to weed out the bots. Why is he charging for low volume pull requests too?

 I dealt with a vendor who accepted payment for items but never shipped us the order. After requesting a refund, they gave us excuse after excuse for 3 months as to why I hadn't received the refund. It wasn't until after I opened a case with the Attorney General's office of Pennsylvania that they refunded us our money. It was just over $4k they were paid for goods that were never delivered. The order was initially placed on December 6, 2022 and we didn't receive the refund until March 6, 2023.

 Basically this will send app notification emails like Sharepoint, Teams, etc... from a domain and address you specify, and they are sent from your actual Exchange Online instance.
 This will mean it's an internal email and any External tagging you might have will not apply, which would also increase visibility on spoofs.
 Haven't yet turned it on since it's still in preview, but looks promising!

 I AM the mail admin. Changing my config would mean more spam, and less security. Can I tell management to tell the customer to go fuck themselves if they won't even talk to me?
 EDIT:
 Their 'senior infrastructure engineer' called me, and in chronological order: 
  
Ignored the diagnostic information I provided them
 
Blamed me for the problem
 
Told me to change my mail server config to accept their broken DNS (lol nope)
 
Told me to whitelist his domain (Why the fuck would I fake their DNS records on our server?)
 
When I sent the RFC Section & paragraph number...
 
Told me they're in the midst of a migration
 
Told me that they wouldn't fix it for months, if ever
 
Said they'd solve the problem by giving our employees their own eMail addresses on their mail server for 'ease of communication'.
 
 My manager gave me the ok to tell them to go fuck themselves. One less problem in my world.

This issue persists for calls directed to the call queue as well as individual end users. Our setup utilises Microsoft Direct Routing in conjunction with Gamma.
 Despite testing the system on three separate networks, the problem remains. It also affects all devices, including Yealink, Windows, Android, and iOS, regardless of updating them to the latest Teams version.
 With our call queues operating in conference mode, we have attempted to disable this feature but to no avail. Gamma has conducted a call trace and reported that they were able to hear both sides of the conversation. We would greatly appreciate any assistance in addressing this ongoing issue. 
 It has now been a week since our phone system issues began, and we have yet to receive a concrete update or solution from Microsoft.

 I went all over the interface. We're using the singularity version. I can't find anything on scan settings. It just does scan then says its complete. 
 What am I missing here? I made sure the agent is running as "Local System". That was default I never changed it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems like a fairly straightforward problem, unfortunately we're having trouble coming up with a solution that doesn't seem janky.
 Our scenario: US-east coast based company, Windows 10/11 endpoints, we have a small (6 person) satellite office in Korea.
 None of our end users have local admin permissions on their laptops, so periodically they'll need IT assistance to install applications or install drivers (i.e. printers, etc.).
 For folks in timezones that have business hours overlapping with ours, this is a non-issue - we BOMGAR into their laptops, provide the admin credentials, and Bob's your uncle.
 The challenge we're trying to figure out is how to handle this where business hours don't overlap. We can ask end users to leave their computers turned on, which allows us to BOMGAR in unattended, but per best practices, we have a GPO that locks their computer screen after 15 minutes of inactivity, so up 'til now, we've been asking the end user for their password so we can impersonate them. I hate that we do this as it seems janky AF.
 I know we could always sign in as ourselves on their PC and install the software, but unfortunately a lot of the software we've seen is poorly written and has to be installed as the user account that needs to use it.
 The obvious solution is to tell the company that we need to extend our helpdesk operating hours, or we need to have folks on call to handle this type of issue. The first is a non-starter due to $$, and the second is undesirable because who wants to be on call?
 I'm curious if anyone has come up with a better solution for scenarios like this?
 If Windows had some sort of built-in impersonation functionality that could be used to login as an end user (that was properly restricted and audited), that seems like it could be a solution, but I'm not aware of anything like that existing.
 Is this something a 3rd party login manager like Okta, etc. could help us with?

 We currently experience very slow Internet speeds on one of my managed locations.
 According to the ISP it's because we maxed out our Internet bandwidth.
 That would align with my testing.
 Here is the Problem:
 How do I find out which device is using all of the Internet bandwidth all of a sudden.
 Nether the device fleet nor the internet bandwidth changes in the last weeks.
 ​
 I am worried it might be something malicious like a data extraction.
 We are using Unifi switches but I can't see any option in the unifi cloud to monitor device usage of the bandwidth.

Now, I've seen other companies use certs as the authentication method, and obviously I like these more than asking people to write down whatever the 2FA app tells them to, everyday. One thing I don't fully understand (and forgive me for this) is if these certs are the "token" of an actual VPN connection, or if these companies I've seen didn't implement a real VPN solution.
 I'm looking for recommendations based on latest available technologies, good practices, and overall easiness of use.
 We are less than 99 users and everyone has their laptop/VDI administered by an MSP, so whatever tool I decide to use... it should be easy to deploy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 we moved into a new office and would like to enhance overall our presentation vibes. Management has the idea to install Barco Clickshare, but overall it looks nice etc. however it feels massivly overpriced for what it does.
 The majority of our team members are using macs, some external guests might come in with a windows device.
 Am I nuts to seek for a cheaper yet better solution? This can not be that much of a quest, right?
 Too new of a topic for me, however if airplay wouln't have such a crazy latency i'd rather would suggest that.
 Also we would need to use an external camera + speakers (mic) in our setup.
 Thanks in advance.

 We use CodeTwo and some users have complained about a double empty line of space occurring when they reply to emails between the end of their text and the signature. 
 This only happens with replies and it's easy enough to avoid removing the extra line and ensure the text ends at the grey line, but a few users are still complaining. Is there a way to make it so Outlook doesn't add that extra reply line?

 i currently have 10+ clients in a DMZ and want them to retrieve their time from the official Windows NTP Server. I can only get it to work by allowing UDP Port 123 access to ANY destination. It doesn't work when I set the destination to time.windows.com only. Why is that? That's the correct address according to microsoft.
 Can anyone enlighten me here?

 I am part of a big team with over 10000 network devices (switches, routers, FW etc etc). We have a lot of tools that manage polling, metrics and alerts and I am trying to find a suitable solution for us to migrate.
 My team has tried different tools that didn't quite fit but also gave us some insight on what is important.
  
Being future-proof. High availability, scaling and good performance.
 Ability to do some chained lookups. We do some complex collections that require correlating between different OIDs.
 Ability to stream data easily to other tools.
  
LibreNMS was one of the tools i tried but it doesn't really tick all 3 boxes.
 Prometheus+Grafana seems very interesting, but i am not sure that point 2 is possible.
 Some licence solutions we found are very expensive but also I don't like feeling "locked" to a vendor.
 Zabbix seems like a very fitting solution. I didn't like the luck of HA solution but there are ways around it.
 Any suggestion or correction on what I am trying to achieve here?
 Thank you for your time.

 But developers do sometimes run queries that last overnight via a local install of ssms on the remote server over RDP. 
 Can anyone think of a couple ways for them to postpose the pending reboot of the servers they are expecting to use overnight but only for a 24 hour period? A desktop icon would be sick that runs a scheduled task that skips the otherwise pending reboot. Bonus points if instead a user can instead exclude themselves from a group policy that logs off idle connections albeit for a 24 hour period.

 We have approx 100 laptops on 3rd party sites ( all different site owners) where the internet is managed by the customer that are blocking Windows updates from being accessible. We have asked to be whitelisted but proving a pain to get them to do.
 We dont have a WSUS server as all laptops are in AzureAD and we are headless ( no servers any more). 
 I am hence wondering if way(s) around as assume its being blocked either via proxy, wan ( domain name eg windowsupdate.microsoft.com ) being accessible. 
 Happy to consider a paid solution (subject to cost).
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 We have some production servers and would like to change the backup method from push (the servers currently upload the backups it makes to an SFTP server), to PULL, so we have a remote server, which will run Truenas Core, and will pull the backups of the production server.
 This is usually done with Rsync via SSH, but the cybersecurity team is worried that if the backup server gets compromised, the ssh credentials could be used to open a remote shell in the production server.
 The backup server would be really isolated, only accessible via our corporate VPN and to the production server to grab the backups. But still, if a bad actor could get access to the corporate VPN, somehow get the credentials to the backup server, they could get the SSH keys used to do the rsync job and remote into the production server.
 Is there any way we could prevent this? maybe using other kind of software so we don't have to open SSH access between the production and backup servers?
 The production servers are mainly linux but some windows servers aswall. Is there any way a user could be make in linux so not only the user has access to just the backups, but is not able to execute other commands?

 I'm working on a new backbone, and I'm trying to understand/solve traceroute to internet.
 When packet enter on the backbone, I can see three IP by line...
 Ex:
 1 192.168.92.1 (192.168.92.1) 2.073 ms 2.681 ms 2.677 ms
 2 80.X.X.X (80.X.X.X) 14.157 ms 14.140 ms 12.365 ms
 3 toto (80.X.X.Y) 2.875 ms 3.561 tata (80.X.X.Z) 3.910 ms
 4 IXP (A.A.A.A) 9.806 ms tata (80.X.X.Z) 3.535 ms IXP (A.A.A.A) 8.044 ms 
 It seems like a loop, but I don't know where to start the investigation.
 It's a small backbone with OSPF as IGP. 
 ASBR1 ------- L3 Switch1 ====================== L3 Switch2 --------- ASBR2 
 ASBR1 and ASBR2 send default route via OSPF, so each L3 Switch has 2 default route (one is selected). 
 If you have an idea...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got asked by a colleague to present MS Entra to my bosses (small company doing consulting for IAM). I have five minutes and the company works mainly with OIM, so every listener understands IAM way better then I do. I dont like to talk about stuff that I dont understand fairly well, so I am seeking for a bit of help here to not talk rubbish.
 Im fairly new to IAM and only worked with Active Roles so far and a tiny bit on OIM synchronizing CSV-Files to the system. So my knowledge of OIM is pretty limited. Knowledge about Sailpoint is basically non existent. 
 Last year MS launched Entra which includes AAD, a CIEM-Solution, Entra Verified ID and Workload Identities. As far as im aware "MS Entra Identity Governance" is also a new component. 
 I would like to quickly go through the components and then focus on things Entra does way better or way worse than the the other to products.
 I would like to focus on the connection to other systems (especially On-Prem-Systems), since it looks like this could be a weakspot of MS Entra. Is there anything MS Entra (or Azure AD) cant do and why?
 Lifecycle-Management is also a topic I want to focus on. Looks to me like I am pretty limited to what MS offers out of the box. For example if I create a new Workflow for a Leaver I can put in a step, that a mail is sent to the employees manager, but not to the colleagues. 
 Is there anything else MS does greatly or badly on this topic?
 I do greatly appreciate your help girls and guys, since I am really not sure about what to focus on and where the weaknesses of each application are. According to the websites they all can do everything and do everything best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Guys, 
 I'm just curious as to how you filter routes in Viptela. For example, if I need to find a specific route in the vEdge cli routing table, do I only have the execute using "Include" or adding the correct IP and subnet? 
 Ex. It will take some time to verify whether I got a route if I attempt to to search this IP 10.1.192.1/32.
 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1/32 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 | i 10.1.192. | nomore vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1 show ip best-match-route vpn 1 ipv4 10.1.192.1 * --------------------------------------------^ syntax error: unknown argument Error executing command: CLI command error - 
 It occasionally fails too by not adding the subnet or incorrect subnet. 
 What other option do I have to determine the route that a host or IP belongs to in viptela?
 ​
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to deploy a Windows 11 In Place Upgrade with our software deployment tool. The prep is already done, ISO extracted, batch file with all the params created. 
 When I manually execute the batch file that basically says 
 setup.exe /auto upgrade /DynamicUpdate disable /showoobe none /Telemetry disable
 it asks me for admin credentials and after entering them with 2 clicks it just does the upgrade. When I'm logged in as an admin it just shows the user access control window with Yes / No and does it. But that credential request shouldn't come up for regular users, obviously. 
 When I execute this batch file from the deployment service however it just doesn't do anything. The deployment script runs forever and never logs what went wrong. Doesn't matter if I use a silent parameter or not. 
 My guess is that the problem is in the context in which the file gets executed. And I have tried all the contexts I could think of. I assume I'm missing a vital part in the logic chain here that prevents me from seeing the solution. 
 Further info: The setup.exe and files are hosted on a file share that can be read-accessed by anyone. The batch file is on the deployment repository and gets downloaded to the client PC when executing. 
 And I've had a similar issue with a different software deployment tool already when I wanted to put a simple shortcut on the desktop of users on a PC as an admin. It feels like that was a similar context issue back then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone.
 I hope I am not too annoying with my questions lately.
 I am having some problems with Azure Information Protection and the valid applications.
 From what I am reading, it seems to work together with data classification and data loss prevention.
 Which means, if a certain document could contain PII, It can detect this and recommend or apply a sensitivity label on that document, making sure whenever it might leave the company, that the data will be unusable for everyone outside of the company.
 It's a defense mechanism, which extrudes outwards, into the public world.
 I've seen examples, where they only use 3-5 Labels with encryption and/or watermarking. This makes total sense to me, as I have worked with PII before.
 My boss now heard this and thinks, that this will solve all of our problems.
 He told me to create 5 sensitivity labels, for each personnel group of our company. From the CEO to the normal employee. Everyone should get access to documents with a certain sensitivty label, but not others.
 From what he described, he wants a protection, which goes inwards. His example shows, that the he is very wary about his employees.
 No watermarking or data classification. Just encrypt everything and make sure, that no normal employee has access to sensitive documents from his team lead or above.
 This feels wrong to me. I haven't found any example, where Information Protection was used like this. And with that I have a thousand questions and possible outcomes in my mind, because I feel like that it won't stay at 5 labels. In the end I might have to create a label for every project.
 I've seen the quote, that Information Protection are permissions, which move with the documents. But I feel like that my example is a bit "extreme".
 Has anybody used this before like this? Is this a valid use for Information Protection or is there another solution?

 But I've misplaced it. Can't justify dropping $450 to replace it right now. 
 Looking for a software for a windows laptop that can perform some of those same features when testing a single ethernet drop. 
 Honestly, the Link Sprinter has spoiled me, especially with the switch port ID when troubleshooting offline APs. No power? Cool switch port may have lost POE function. As long as I have solid link to a switch, I can ID which switch port the AP drop is on without toning/tracing. Saves multiple trips back/forth to IDF. 
 Any pointers?

How can I see which certs are in play on that site and then delete the ones not in use? Is it just as simple as checking the bindings on that one site? I've done that and I see cert4 is bound to the 443 binding, just double want to be absolutely sure that certs 1 to 3 are not bound anywhere else. I was hoping a table or mmc view might show this, but perhaps not.

One employee's parent was even contacted & they can't think of any place they have their parents' number (not as an emg contact, beneficiary l, life insurance etc... I first, immediately thought of a breach with Paychex or Bamboo or even LinkedIn, but I'm not sure... especially because the employee is sure her family member's number isn't listed anywhere. The fact that the employee's parent got a text is really throwing a wrench in this. We've had employees get texts from our "ceo" asking for gift cards, but this isn't that. I'm inclined to think... find where the family member's number is listed & find the possible link, but idk... nothing is standing out. The employee said she doesn't have her family member's number listed on anything work related. This is so scary. Any ideas? Our anti-virus isn't picking anything up. Our server & emails are fine I'm perplexed with the personal cell numbers. Help!

 I’ve been in my current role as an IT Technician for the last two years. Although my title doesn’t match what I actually do. My experience in IT is mostly call center and level 1 and 2 troubleshooting but with my current role I’ve been working more with networking and server issues. 
 I want to learn more about how our servers work, how the networking switches are configured and everything else I can learn. The issue is that I don’t know how to figure it all out and my boss doesn’t want to teach me unless it’s relevant at the time. The problem is I’m two years in and I don’t feel like I know enough. Also my boss doesn’t make himself available so when there’s problems I’m left scrambling for answers. 
 Any advice? 
 TLDR: want to learn as much as I can about our IT infrastructure but boss will not help.

 Many on the IT team seem excited to have these at their home, but my main question is doesn't all my internet traffic on my router then go through the company's firewall? This would be a stand alone device that hooks into my router, but that seems super sketchy to have a company device like that always monitoring my network traffic.

 Both have enough 10g SFP+ which are important to me. The amount of ports are overkill for my scenario but I could not find a good L3 10g switch for less honestly.

The playbook now works as expected 
 Hello all.
 I'm very new to using Ansible, and i'm following a course where his output is gathering Cisco IP information. It's returning IP information for him, but i'm getting very different output so i'm thinking Ansible changed the way this ansible_facts works, but I don't fully understand the documentation to fix this. Below is my sample playbook. Any help would be appreciated. For now, off to google some more...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, got a call from a new client who has their internet drop out every 2 hours at the top of the hour.
 More Detail:
 Client has a 100Mb circuit, and for the past few weeks, their connection dies every 2 hours at the top of the hour for a couple minutes, then comes back up. Pings during those outages show connection to their sonicwall, gets to the gateway, and then dies out from there. At&t tech says that their connection is just getting over saturated with standard traffic, ran a pcap from their end, and no signs of DDos or anything irregular.
 I ran wireshark from a client machine and saw nothing out of the ordinary other than packets trying to resend during the outages, sonicwall logs show nothing, and during one of the windows when it always dies, I unplugged their network from the at&t circuit, plugged directly into it, and had no issues during that window. Next step is to setup a netflow monitor to PRTG and see what that shows, but just figured I'd bounce the issue on here to get any suggestions. Gut feeling (for whatever that's worth) is that it's an issue on the circuit that I'll have to convince the isp about. According to the client, nothing has changed inside the network before this started, and the 5 minute windows every 2 hours make it a challenge to test theories and chasing down rabbit holes.

 When watching different YouTube videos of people setting up their edgerouter x, they further tailored this router through its terminal to be more efficient with their use case. Honesty looked like black magic gibberish…
 I’m wondering if anybody has suggestions to make my network more efficient and dependable. Only thing I did outside of a standard/quick setup was hide my network name on the AP.
 Any suggestions and learning material are appreciated. Currently waiting for “introduction to show networking” by John Huntington.

 If we go over cap, we get dropped to 10mbps, so that won't do. 
 I have indeed tried to research this, but everything comes up with data info for Zoom meetings, etc.

I was a single sysadmin/tech at that company. So my boss choose an MSP and today i did gave him my documentation and a training session. Job done. 
 However, what i saw truly blew my mind. Here are a few things, which made me believe i‘m in the wrong movie.
 1) Gave him access to one 1Password Vault. He didn‘t know what it is (fine, not everyone can know everything) and he said how insecure this is. I asked him, why he came to this conclusion when he didn‘t read the whitepaper and what tool he would choose. Answer: My laptop uses bitlocker, that‘s why i store everything in excel. I asked him what he would do if his devices getting compromised? As long as his device is powered on bitlocker doesn‘t help. Well, if i get compromised it‘s over anyway, a password manager wouldn‘t help. 
 2) he doesn‘t deactivate or remove the local admin account, because he‘s the only one who knows the password anyway.
 3) he couldn‘t tell the difference between MB and GB/TB.
 4) he has no clue about linux and has no employee who does and still manages linux machines.
 I needed to vent, cause i always was thinking i‘m still not good enough for a sole sysadmin role to get a job at another company (i did, but struggled long time to do this step) and did know more than a MSP boss with 100s of clients…

 I am currently studying NETCONF and YANG data modeling, and so far, I am somewhat understanding creating filters to pull data. I can formulate a filter to request a container within the model, but I cannot figure out how to pull ALL containers at once, aka pulling the entire model's worth of data.
 Can someone please assist me in understanding how to do this? For reference, I am using ncclient and the YANG model I am using is ietf-interfaces.yang.
 Thank you.
 Edit: To clarify, I know that in the XML filter, you can call all the containers in one go. However, assuming a YANG model with too many damn containers, I'd like to find a way to call them all at once in one short, simple filter.

 The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a nationwide ground stop for Southwest Airlines flights, citing “equipment issues.”
 “Southwest Airlines requested the FAA pause the airline’s departures,” the agency told CNN in a statement.
 Southwest Airlines reported technology issues Tuesday morning and said it would “hopefully be resuming our operation as soon as possible.” c
 The flight tracking website FlightAware said nearly 800 of the airline’s flights – about 14 percent of its schedule – were delayed Tuesday, far ahead of any US carrier.
 Southwest called the problem “intermittent technology issues” in a social media post to customers. Several have taken to social media to complain about delayed flights
 “We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we’re hoping to get everyone going ASAP,” the airline wrote in another social media post.
 CNN has reached out to Southwest and the Federal Aviation Administration for further comment.

Both degrees look great from my perspective so sorry for my ignorance.
 Computer Science was my 1st choice but I would have to take a term break to take Calculus and re-enter and I don't see that being the play at this point, maybe a masters later, who knows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a month ago I was laid off, and without work for the first time in 15 years. I got depressed and it seemed like no one was hiring. I submitted over 200 applications and resumes and that first week or two all I got were rejection letters. I worked on my resume and cover letter and finally had 6 interviews last week. I ended up with 2 job offers so far, but what really got me was the way the manager of one of the companies went about it. He went back to his boss and asked for 15% more than the top end of the posted salary range because "We need this guy, and we need to be competitive in the market to get him" (his exact words). I ended up taking a ~20% pay cut from where I was before the layoff, but I think I found a place that wants me. 
 It was really nice to feel like the pretty girl at the dance for once. Keep it up, there is a job out there that really wants every one of us, I was just lucky to find one when I needed it the most.

 Computers, and GPUs in particular, are getting faster (looking at you ChatGPT). This table outlines the time it takes a computer to brute force your password, and isn’t indicative of how fast a hacker can break your password (especially if they phished you). It’s a good visual to show people why better passwords can lead to better cybersecurity - but ultimately it’s just one of many tools we can use to talk about protecting ourselves online!

 I get an auto renewal reminder email this AM saying my domain is set to auto renew in May for $1200 USD for the year!
 I opened up a support chat with NameCheap and they indicate the registry for .help now considers my domain to be classified as premium. 
 Wtf is this? There was no warning or indication of a price increase, a literal arbitrary cost increase based on an existing registered domain, and classifying it as premium after the fact is flat out extortion. 
 I’m considering transferring the domain away from NameCheap to another registrar. I’m looking for advice to see if anyone knows of any .help registrars that offer a free or low cost transfer option, and hopefully a reasonable renewal rate. 
 I see hover has .help support but their renewal rate is approx $1000 after the first year. I don’t know what PorkBun offers. Neither of these places I have an account for. 
 Has this happened to you before?
 Would it be worth bringing this up to ICANN?
 Would love to know your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen hundreds of posts over the years from computer techs who absolutely cringe at the idea of working on home computers, and I'm curious why.
 I work on home and small business computers. In a medium metro area I bill $140 for a home visit up to 1.5 hours, then $80/hour. Since many calls end up being "install a printer," or "get rid of my pop-ups" some of those calls end up taking 20-45 minutes, and I can sometimes finish 5-7 calls in a 8 hour day.
 Have additional problems? Book an additional appointment. 
 I've been doing this for about 19 years with VERY few major issues, and I find the stress to be incredibly low in my residential work.
 When it comes to income, if I maintain just 4 residential appointments each day for 45 weeks a year, income would be $126,000, again, with minimal stress (although admittedly more car wear & tear).
 When you are competing with the big box stores, you really don't have competition. 
 Why the hate on residential?

 What are some things I could pivot to? TAC seems like the logical answer, but I'm not sure how the pay would stack up. Network-related product testing/QA was another that caught my eye, but few of those don't require a software background. Any outside-the-box stuff I could look at?

 It lets you use a PowerShell command to set the membertimetolive attribute when you add a member to a group so the accounts automatically lose access to the group after a set length of time.
 Is this really useful? It seems impractical because I don’t see any parameter you can set to schedule a future start time. For instance giving a user membership to a group during a future change window.
 You would need to use a scheduled task running as an account with privileges to add users to groups and scheduling it to run the command at the future date and time. If you are messing with scheduled tasks anyway, you can do almost the same thing already without activating this optional feature. Just run two tasks. One to add the membership and another to remove the membership,

 May I ask for some help and recommendations, to setup Windows Defender? Especially for Mail attachments.
 Some Background. Currently we are switching from Forti Endpoint Security to Windows Defender for Business.
 I've checked all common options in Intune and checked out the windows defender playground and demo files. Everything gets detected from my tests.
 Regarding Internet Security I feel somewhat safe now.
 Though, I have problems in detecting email attachment. Several times per week I receive notifications from my forti ems server, about newly found malware in mail attachments. We receive a high amount of fake invoices, voice messages or other stuff, hidden in html files. Typical javascript stuff, phishing. 
 For me this is obvious. Invoices shoulnd't arrive in html format.
 And yet, people who are already using the windows defender ask me regularly "Is this spam?"
 Stuff like "Customer Invoice LIQUIDATION CENTER LTD.html" faking a identical clone of the microsoft authentication. Forti was able to detect these kinds of attacks, but not the defender.
 We have also setup a Office 365 Anti-Phishing Policy. But I feel like it's not working as it should, or it only applies to mails, but doesn't apply on attachments?
 What am I doing wrong? Why isn't stuff like this getting detected?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to preface this by saying that even though I use the word "we" extensively, I have only been employed here about 2 weeks. Our IT department is me and my boss. My position was newly created. So 'we', really means 'boss'.
 Also, links to a place where I can read more about this subject is appreciated.
 ​
 We run about a 100 android tablets through MaaS360 and android enterprise. When we first started doing this, we used a single gmail account to set up all the devices. However when we got to about 30 devices or so, it started dropping devices. So we created a second account. Same problem, but it was around 20 devices this time. So on so forth, now we have several gmail accounts managing our devices. I cannot find anything online that indicates a limit. MaaS360 doesn't have a limit in our range I know. 
 Now I did see that there is a limit to 10 devices per user in MaaS360. One possibility is that we would set up devices for different users, but my supervisor would set up test devices under her name. This would then cause registration issues for subsequent devices. This only sort of makes sense though, because I can't see her setting up 10+ devices for herself. I also think it was dropping other users devices, not her devices. 
 I feel the need to include timeframe here as well, in case things changed. We started this process about 5 or 6 years ago and slowly ran into issues. 
 ​
 Anything you can help me with this is welcome. Thanks!

 I think that there is a security issue here, since Administrator credentials will be cached on workstations.
 I wondering if the same risk will happens if that admin uses RDP to access machines remotely? 
 If a workstation is suddenly rebooted, cached credentials will be gone, correct, or will they still be there?

 My environment leverages Group Policy to install the LAPSx64.msi (I'm assuming this installer encompasses the client-side extensions mentioned in the article above). We have a number of OSs that miss the coverage window on the new Windows LAPS coverage, and so we will continue using the legacy LAPS solution for the time being. 
 Can someone check my logic?:
  
Installing the 04/2023 MS Updates on devices that currently have legacy LAPS installed will continue to operate normally.
 New devices that receive the 04/2023 MS Updates (baked into an image, installed via task sequence on deployment, etc.) and THEN receive the LAPS CSE msi will then break
 THEREFORE: As long as LAPS CSE is installed before 04/2023 update, legacy-mode LAPS should work fine. (?)

 Don't you love it when you're the top level admin for your organization and you're forced to open support tickets with software companies and get stuck with level 1 support for months on the same issue with every "solution" that they give you more useless than the last?
 Hey on a side note, if anyone is thinking about using LastPass for idp/SSO and MFA, my recommendation is fuck no.
 If I could go back in time I would rip up the contract and lay a duo product sheet in front of my boss.
 Anyways that's all, have a great work day everyone.

 The company i work for wants to go full Microsoft Azure / Microsoft 365 and is heading towards Exchange Online / Sharepoint / MS Teams as main Callcenter and so on...
 I already talked to a GDPR lawyer because of it Microsoft not being compliant. She says its not and even if we are doing everything we can to ensure it, its still not compliant enough or even close because of some rules and some microsoft contract stuff. 
 How are other sysadmins handling this topic in europe? I know that the authorities dont really look into the whole MS Azure thing in germany, but we want to be fully compliant!
 If this is the wrong sub just tell me ;)

 Its driving me crazy!
 Cannot seem to find anything in google that has been helpful.
 The fingerprint sensor is constantly trying to scan for a fingerprint when nothing is touching it.
 The impact of this is it keeps the windows lock screen active and monitors never turn off etc.
 Just keeps flashing your device is having trouble recognizing you, please try again, constantly.
 ​
 If you touch it, it logs in correctly.
 Device:Asus ROG Flow X13 GV301QE
 Fingerprint device: ELAN WBF Fingerprint sensor - asus driver version is 3.5.12201.11202
 Windows 11 with latest updates
 Troubleshooting: 
 Tried newer drivers, older drivers, specifically listed driver from Asus, no difference.
 Many restarts.
 Nothing specific I can find in event viewer
 ​
 For now I have deleted my fingerprint so its not happening and monitors will turn off etc.

In my case, there are about 250 pcs that have Bitdefender Gravityzone installed, with the patch management add-on. But we also recently got licenses for MDE P1 from the main hq (no idea why, maybe it's a global requirement but nobody notified us...), enough to cover all those pcs. The question is, should we drop Bitdefender and stick cu MDE only, or keep it like it is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. We have 2 domain controllers at one of our sites that's running up replication errors. I'm not sure where to start with it so I'm in need of some advice. Firstly, running the command:
 get-addomain generated an error 'server instance not found on the given port'
 Running the repadmin /replsummary show command generates an error of 'repadmin can't connect to a home server. Error: An LDAP lookup operation failed with the following error: LDAP Error 81<0x51>: Server down'. 
 Running the repadmin /replsum command shows the following:
 Destination DSA: DC1
 Largest Delta: >60 days
 fails/total%%: 10/10 
 error: <2148074274> The target principal name is incorrect 
 Finally, running the repadmin /showrepl command shows error KCC could not add this REPLICA LINK due to error. 
 The DCs at the site don't hold any FSMO roles so that should things a bit easier. For the replica link issue, I've come across a potential fix that says to delete then recreate the account. For the other issues I'm not sure what the best approach to take is.
 For the target principal name error, will this fix likely work? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/replication-error-2146893022
 Is it better just to create 2 new DCs for the site?

Usually, we offer the options MS Authenticator on company iPhones or any authenticator app on personal phones. Only a few exceptions so far requested and/or got a hardware TOTP token (by Token2), but it's hard to manage for our sites without IT staff and with Microsoft's requirement for Global Admin rights for setting them up currently.
 In China we don't have a lot of company phones, but a lot of personal Huawei devices without Google services. Any authenticator/TOTP app I suggested is not available in Huawei App Gallery for China and the manual installation of apk files is also not a real option.
 Is there anybody out there who is able to suggest an app which is available in Chinese app stores, especially for Huawei?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reaching out for some advice, input, or just a general plan on how to deal with a challenging situation I'm currently facing at work. I work in a company where I am responsible for procuring everything but laptops (phones, chargers, monitors, docking stations, printer maintenance services, VESA mounts, laptop bags, headsets, mice, and keyboards).
 To make things even more complicated, I have to categorize each item properly in SAP so management approves these purchases, attaching the 'price offer' which is often just a screenshot of a price on a website. After that, I have to 'goods movement' them into SAP, attaching the invoice or proof of work.
 This process is causing me a lot of trouble since finance is constantly telling me that the material group, G/L account, or cost center is incorrect, which forces me to recategorize or start the process over. Unfortunately, my colleague already quit due to the frustration, and my boss has not delivered on promised changes to the process. As a result, I'm left alone to handle this mess together with all the IT work.
 This situation is taking up hours of my time daily, and I'm struggling to find a solution. My boss insists that we have to perform these activities and prioritize them, likely because his IT Director reports directly under a Finance director. Procurement says we have to open the Purchase Requisitions, as they can't transform them into Purchase orders themselves due to conflict of interest and policy concerns (although I doubt the legitimacy of this claim).
 I didn't want to vent, but I'm genuinely seeking advice and input from the r/sysadmin community. If any of you have faced similar issues or have any tips, suggestions, or a plan to tackle this problem, please share your thoughts. I'm eager to find a way to streamline this process or at least make it more manageable.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 One of our customers using Sharepoint uses Onedrive to sync the libraries to their desktop PC's. Recently we have completely changed the structure of their Sharepoint site, renamed several Libraries and changed A LOT of rights.
 The problem I am now facing, is that users that now lost their permissions to certain libraries or libraries that had their name changed/got removed, will still see the folders on their respective PC's. The folders are no longer synced, but they are still present on the systems including files. Every user may even face this on multiple pc's as they work on multiple systems (flex). As you know, this may differ for every user aswell, because they all have different rights.
 Question is, do you know any way to automatically remove libraries that are no longer synced?
 The systems are managed through Intune and are all Azure AD joined. I haven't been able to solve this braincracker yet and our support desk has been called many many times by customers seeing 'the wrong folders' or people editting files locally, because they are not synced anymore.
 Thanks.

The issue right now is a lot of people are jumping ship due to poor management. As more and more people leave, I find myself taking on more work to keep things stable at the company. I thought this added responsibility would befit a raise to which my boss agreed, but I was offered roughly a dollar more (I’m salary). 
 The other part of this is that I was told that I was on track to becoming a VP , but that position was given to an outside hire whom I had to train. So I’m at a point where I feel like I am going nowhere in the company. 
 I was given a new job opportunity at a more mom & pop IT group. While things are definitely going south at my current company, I can’t help but be nervous that maybe I am jumping the gun. 
 The new employer has promised to match my pay, but I am losing earned PTO and my cell phone bill being paid each month. Should I take the position at the mom and pop place ? Whom offered medical benefits , but at a 50% employer paid rate. Or stay at the company that keeps telling me to stay in my lane every time I try to give help where it’s needed? They have no medical benefits at this time. I’m mostly worried about taking a small financial cut and no PTO to get out of a poorly managed company.

 So curious if anyone has any good solutions for organizing a mess of fiber patches, copper patches, various adapters and vendor specific cables, etc. Not really looking for a tool bag for ALL of my crap, just organizing out all the various cables and cable adapters a tech carries in the field. Ideally I'd rather just have all my cabling and various adapters in one location, but I'm not 100% opposed to separating it out to fiber and copper related.

 I'm curious as to how you guys go about setting up WiFi in dense high rise buildings?
 Ive got a office 1 of 3 on a middle floor and the WiFi spectrum is just saturated, from what I can tell everyone side to side and above and below are all set to auto so everything I just jumping all over the place. 
 What's best practice to actually set up my office to be as resilient as I can? As it is people get occasional drop outs (enough to kill a teams call). 
 I've got 3x Meraki MR18's (I know theyre old I've asked for new stuff but I'm not holding my breathe) to work with any suggestions would be appreciated.

I have an Trusted interface, it is actually 4 ports in a link aggregation, and a tagged Vlan interface in a different port for a different network. The both goes to the same switch. The link aggregation goes to the switch in access mode with all the ports in Vlan1. The VLan interface goes to a trunk port in that switch. I am trying to give access to the Trusted 1 to the Vlan interface (only some users but for the sake of the question lets says all).
 I created 4 policies TCP/UDP, from trusted to Vlan10, Vlan10 to trusted. and 2 same way for http and https since what is behind Vlan10 are cameras that I need to manage using browser. No matter what I do I do not manage to send or get traffic from or to the Vlan interface. I can ping the cameras from the wathcguard but that is it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hopefully this will save time for others.
 We recently started rolling out Surface Laptop 5 to our staff, replacing old models. Almost immediately staff started complaining about USB devices (keyboard/mouse/whatever) disconnecting at random times or not working at all.
 We spent one month troubleshooting to the point that we stopped any further purchases while working with Microsoft support.
 The issue turns out to be SentinelOne. 
 Scenario:
  
Device with Intel Smart Sound Technology for USB Audio – affects ALL Surface Laptop 5, but not 4 – probably it needs to be a specific hardware.
 S1 with Device Control enabled – it just needs to be enabled, no rules needed – We can reproduce with agent version 22.1 , 22.2 and 22.3
 Users plugs in a USB device that interact with the audio subsystem, directly to the USB port of to a USB hub, connected to the laptop, which would include : webcams, headsets, etc…
 All USB devices connected to the laptop (whether USB hub, USB hub through a dock, or directly), crash and disconnect, sometime the laptop may bluescreen or freeze.
 Uninstalling S1 agent immediately fixes the behaviour
 To workaround the issue and allow S1 agent to be installed, we had to add the following override, in S1 console under settings-policy override
  
​
 {
 "deviceControl": {
 "excludedDeviceSetupClasses": [
 "{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}"
 ]
 }
 }
 ​
  
the 4d36 etc is the GUID Class ID of the Intell SST USB interface, you can grab it by right clicking on the device in device manager.
 Change will immediately apply, no restart needed, to all devices in the scope where you configured the policy override.
  
​
 I have passed all these info to S1 support so they hopefully can release new version of the agent.

 We are wanting to operate a popup wifi network for an outdoor event in a field. We have a basic idea of a design hardware wise and want to see if it’s even in the ballpark of where we need to be. We are wanting to keep the design value oriented since this will only be used for specific events. We want to support up to 5000 users with basic mobile phone usage over Wi-Fi. We have a 10gb fiber backhaul. 
 Mikrotik CCR2216 Router x 1
 Mikrotik CRS510 Switch x 1
 EnGenius Cloud ECS5512FP Switch x 2
 EnGenius ECW270 AP x 14 
 Would this cover our needs? We will have a 3rd party captive portal for authentication. This is for high level preliminary budgeting purposes. 
 Thanks!
 Edit:
 Thanks to those with constructive replies. We are definitely hiring a consultant and will have network engineers running the the show. This was a basic post to ask a question for a ballpark budgetary check. Should’ve posted this in the moronic question Monday or whatever it’s called.

 I downloaded the image and pushed it to the device, did an md5 verification and came back good. 
 I also tried issuing the upgrade command to R0 and then RP active with the same result. 
 I guess I can try redownloading the image and trying again but wanted to know if I’m missing something. Seems pretty straightforward though. 
 Not a major issue, just trying to clear a bug relating to power environment logs. I did upgrade to the latest gold star IOS-XE software beforehand. 
 Just looking to see if anyone experienced this.

 If I were MS I would feel embarrassed. It's a virtual certainty that any of the folks on this subreddit know more about their product than their first few levels of support. But since they're the gatekeepers under some circumstances, you're left with no choice but to suffer through days of aimless questions. 
 The language barrier in some cases for me is to the point where I can't even understand what's being asked of me.
 It's just a deeply frustrating experience. For one of the largest corporations in the world, they should be able to do much better on the support side of their business.

The one issue I have never been able to resolve is pasting in commands into the web browser CLI. It would save me quite a bit of time in my labs if I was able to copy and paste the initial device configurations directly into the web browser CLI (i.e. interface ip's, device name, username/password etc.). I am able to use PuTTY to SSH into my devices from windows but this requires me to set up SSH on each device individually. Hoping someone has a quick solution that would save me time so I can focus on the core lessons of the labs.

 Our quarantine policy allows for end users to release emails from quarantine, but I was wondering if this is still submitting them for machine learning to improve the system.
 What made me question this was noticing that the end user doesn't have the option to "Report to Microsoft to improve detection" like an admin does when they release an email.
 End users do have the option "Report message as having no threats" but they are still getting multiple quarantines from the same domain and senders.
 Obviously I can whitelist the domains/senders/IPs in Policies and Rules, but this lead me to wonder are the end user releases actually sending data to machine learning?

 We've inherited an environment with a PowerVault MD3800i. We installed a few new drives in it (model MG03SCA400) that are listed in Dell's Support Matrix
 Using MDSM, the drives are seen but theirStatus and Mode are both listed as "Incompatible".
 My first instinct is that this is because they're on firmware version 0108 while DG09 is what is supported.
 The trouble is, I can't get the new firmware onto them! I go to Upgrade>Physical Disk Firmware, and choose the file, which MDSM does say that it's compatible with them. 
 Then I try to load it onto these drives it returns Error 249 - failed because they are bypassed/offline. (Incidentally I tried this in Online/All/Parallel modes)
 So unless I'm missing something it looks like a catch-22; I can't upload the firmware because the firmware is out of date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got approached by someone who wants me to come work for them. The pay is going to be more, the estate is probably 10x’s bigger than my current place, and it’s a spin off from a huge company. So it’s sorta like a startup in the way that the tech is all shiney and new. No legacy stuff at all. 
 I love my current job. We are also shiney and new and since we are way smaller, I’m well known by everyone, even the C-Suite. They know the names of my wife and kids and always ask about them when they see me. I’m also respected and one of the leaders others seek out. 
 The team is siloed into 5 parts at the new place and I will be leading one of the silos but will take part in the other areas. Today, I do all 5 parts and do them well. So I’ll be less focused on those other areas. Also my work load is insanely easy at my current place. I can work 60 hours one week and maybe 40 minutes other weeks. I can come and go as I please at my current place, my boss doesn’t care what I do. The people at my current place are also some of the smartest people I’ve got to work with. And I have known and worked with these people (holy shit this just occurred to me when I did the math) for MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE! 
 I’m really torn here. Any thoughts from people who have been in this situation?
 Edit: A couple of the posts here answered the question. This post could tend to get a lot of responses so I’m going to stick with the current gig. I’ve been here since I was a teenager (buy outs, ipos, spin-offs). I haven’t had a real interview in 25 years so I’m going to get to the end of the interview process at this new place and kindly decline. I don’t want to burn bridges.

 I think I have to use event manager but its not clear on how to do so.
 To make things more secure I would like to do this with public key auth, however I am not sure how to convert the cisco's output for the rsa public key to something I can put into a authorized_key file for trust, does anyone have instructions on how to do this too?

 I want to disable NAT, so that my firewall (IPFire/Fortigate) can do NAT. But I dont know how to configure it.
 When i disable NAT, i dont get the public IP on my firewall via DHCP, manually doesnt work neighter. Using PPPOE/DialUp and all that doesnt make sense neighter, because the router shows that he is already connected and has a public IP Adress, even when i disable NAT, so why should the firewall dial in when the router already did that
 So where is my error in my brain or in my configuration
 I just want my firewalls to get my only public ip adress so i can block certain countries for hosting

 I recently picked up a pair of used managed switches (TP-Link T1600G-28PS) for 1/4 the price of new ones. We have all TP-Link managed switches, so I'm planning ahead now.
 So, I go to test them; it boots up just fine and loads the web UI. Just like I'm used to, except this one is super quiet. Then I realize...the fans are off. Not low, they're O-F-F. Is that normal and to be expected? Did I just not notice the others doing this in the din of our "MDF"?
 I've seen a few machines running with no fans: I have an EdgeRouter (fan-less) at home and an arsenal of Raspberry Pis. But I've never seen this level of equipment running with no fans.
 So, should I be concerned? Does they need to be repaired or replaced? I'm not in tune with the thermodynamics (heat management) of network equipment. Please advise.
 FWIW, if I put these in production, they could potentially be feeding power to a few SIP phones and IP cameras (max 5W for both devices).

 Lately, more and more I am seeing domain joined hosts that just will not sync their time from a domain controller for love nor money.
 In most of these cases the time source becomes "Local CMOS"
 I have tried multiple guides online and usually what I end up doing is giving up and setting an NTP server on the workstation side which is not ideal 
 Does anyone have any sort of SOP for doing this, or any advice on best practice?
 Thanks
 Edit: thanks for all the comments people I will go through all these suggestions. Seems more complicated than it needs to be generally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorting IP addresses in Excel creates results in situations where 100.0.0.1 will come before 20.0.0.1 because they are treated as text and 1 comes before 2. All the research I've done points to having to split the IP into four columns, sorting them, and recombining them as the only way to get Excel to realize that 20 comes before 100. This would work fine for a static document but for a living one, it quickly becomes a problem.
 Does anyone have a tip or trick to get it to sort IPs correctly without resorting to the process described above or use a program they can recommend that is similar to Excel but knows how to sort them correctly?
 Edit: Thank you for all of the input. I think I need to research some IPAMs now to see if any of those will work for what I'm needing to do.

Something was up with the Windows System Protection and Restore settings. The disk space usage was set to 100% which in turn filled up the entire drive. 
 Solution: Run > sysdm.cpl > System Protection tab > Configure button > Delete all restore points and move the slider down to something lower (I've been choosing 10%). No restart required, but not a bad idea to do one. 
 I'm not sure what's causing it. Just thought I would post something in case others ran into it :)

 As a result, some vendors that send emails on our behalf (using our domain) have been routing to junk/spam as expected. We have resolved issues with vendors that support DKIM signing and DMARC, however some vendors just flat out don't support it. Before DKIM and DMARC we were able to allow these emails through just with basic mail flow rules.
 Service Fusion for example is a vendor that doesn't seem to support it (https://dmarc.io/source/service-fusion/). How do you deal with these particular vendors? I have suggested to my service manager to use the default domain (as opposed to using our domain), however he's wondering why we can't leave it the way it's always been.
 From his perspective, our "enhancements" to our email security are a step backwards for him and his department. He's requesting us to revert our changes (which we're not interested in doing). It seems to me like the obvious way to proceed is to use the out of the box domain instead of trying to spoof our domain without proper DKIM and DMARC, but I was just interested what the community's opinion is on this?

 I have a roughly 20-30 minute window in the evening when I can perform this task via a shutdown script. This shutdown task can be split over multiple reboots so its not essential that the action take place in one run, as long as I can gracefully pick up where it left off on the previous reboot. You may ask, why dont you extend the shutdown time out on the script, I could, but I am managing an estate of 4000 PC's, I dont want to make a fundamental change to the other ~3900 just for these 100.

 I am doing some very preliminary research on a couple tools but am not ready to do demos yet. Not looking for recommendations for other tools either.
 Anyone willing to share recent pricing on these? I know that these are not all exactly in the same bucket, but they seem to have some carryover for what we are doing with ITOps and SecOps.
  
Tanium (I hear its pricy...but what does pricy mean?)
 Tenable
 Ivanti
 Automox (just for patching)
  
Thanks in advance! I really appreciate any insight you can provide! 
 edit: Realized I was spelling Ivanti wrong. Too late in the title. :P

 For some reason, in this case this hasn't happened. There's no entry put into AD's DNS server for these systems.
 If I go on to one of them and try to ping the others, it works, but using an ipv6 address.
 If I disable ipv6 then try ping again, it works, but it says the target system name is '<hostname>.local'
 This was a standard deployment of server 2022 using MDT and in Feb I deployed machines the same way and they worked fine.
 Does anyone have any idea what might be going on?

Windows Update for Business policies are very generic and not a WSUS replacement.
 What I mean by comparable control and visibility to WSUS is:
  
For every update, you can see which computers have installed, not installed, failed install, or are pending reboot to install it.
 You can make groups out of computers to report on and control
 Each update is explicitly approved by you (or a script/criteria you built) for each group, and under no circumstances can Microsoft push anything to clients without your permission.
 Drivers can be included if you're willing to deal with them on this level, or excluded and done automatically.
  
I don't like having to choose between control and visibility and the risk of remote users who don't use the VPN enough being outdated, or them just not being managed at all.

 Azure AD app has Password hash synchronisation and Password writeback enabled.
 I’ve tried to reset a test account’s password but the password is not syncing back to premises. I can use the new password in O365, but can’t login to PC unless using old pwd.

 Any ideas on where to look?

 For the life of me I can't figure out why it fails to cast to smart tv's in the office and a Microsoft adapter, I know it uses the same technology. WIFI.
 This is what i've found out.
 - Casting to smart TV's on laptops that are not domain joined and not on the wifi *WORK*
 - Trying to cast from domain joined laptops fails or buffers endlessly
 - Disconnecting from the company domain WIFI also fails from a domain joined laptop.
 ​
 So it seems the issue isn't down to the network configuration but down to a laptop being domain joined.
 Does anyone else have any idea what to look at/check/do?

 In preparation of migrating to Win11, and also because of general security, I am in the midst of moving our 802.1x authentication from PEAP to EAP-TLS. I am stuck on an issue that I can't seem to figure out despite reading documentation, watching tutorials etc. 
 I have a Computer group that i'll call EAPTLS-group and a computer that I'll call Computer1, that is a member of EAPTLS-group. I have set up NPS policys for ethernet, using smartcard of other certificate and enrolled the certificate used so that it is visible on Computer1. Being a member of EAPTLS-group is a requirement. The CA is the same as the NPS server. 
 GPO is set to:
 Autoenroll certificate and renew certs based on templates
 "SmartCard or other certificate" network auth method
 "Computer Only" auth mode
 Selected certificate issuer as well as trusted root CA's
 defined what server to connect to for NPS
 ​
 GPO is applied to:
 OU that Computer1 is placed in
 Authenticated users (also tried security filtering EAPTLS-group but that made no difference)
 ​
 To the issue:
 When trying to connect the NPS security logs say that for Computer1: "The Network Access Permission setting in the dial-in properties of the user account in Active Directory is set to Deny access to the user. To change the Network Access Permission setting to either Allow access or Control access through NPS Network Policy, obtain the properties of the user account in Active Directory Users and Computers, click the Dial-in tab, and change Network Access Permission" 
 This is not true, as it is set to Control access through NPS 
 Any ideas as to what might be happening? My apologies if I'm being unclear, I'm happy to specify 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are considering rebuilding our Windows Server Datacenter Hyper-V hypervisors from 2019 to 2022.
 Our VMs are Server 2019, a few Windows 10, several Linux Ubuntu. We are also contemplating move all or most 2019 servers to 2022.
 To be clear - on the hypervisors we will move VMs to other hosts, wipe an reinstall, and move the VMs back . We will not do an in place upgrade.
 I am interested in your experiences if you have done any of this.
  
What is better?
 
What is worse?
 
What issues, major and minor, have you encountered?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 I'm struggling to find a concise answer from google so thought I would ask here.
 Is RSTP Switch brand dependent? I have an SMB site where we want to swap out the switches currently running most of their network for new Zyxel Models w/PoE which seem to work well for us and have easy and quick config changes via mobile app - I am then looking to move the existing switches D-Link's over to their server cabinet for use here and wanted to use RSTP so if i lose a link between any of the switches in the loop it would be able to get round the other way. 
 I've had this running fine on a single brand of switches but is it possible between different switch brands? I'm looking to keep the older switches to save on costs
 Thanks

 ​
 Got an Outlook issue that I cannot solve, so thought I'd put it to the hive mind.
 We are running Windows 10/11. Server 2019/2022, Office 365 and unfortunately Roaming Profiles (I know, I know, but this isn't changing anytime soon)
 We have a .vbs file that get user info from AD (On Prem) and runs via a logon script in GP to add a group of signatures to Outlook (It contains 4 different signatures as our company has 4 different entities)
 When we logon with a new user, this .vbs script does it's thing as it should but it tries to open Outlook 2016 (Note we are using 365) and tries to connect to an Exchange server which we no longer have, to be able to load the users emails.
 Everytime, I have to cancel this process, the run the actual Outlook (365) to get the user into their emails
 Anyone got any idea how I can stop this happening? I have set up a new user on AD using folder redirection rather than a Roaming Profile and it loads normally, I just have to logoff and back on to be able to view the signatures in Outlook 365
 ​
 If anyone could shed any light it would be appreciated.

 Another big downer for PMG is that it’s not at all mobile friendly, something essential in this day and age.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 So I got an email from Microsoft recently. Subject "Migrate to the Authentication methods policy in Azure Active Directory by 30 September 2024".
 And I wanted to try following the instructions and try it in a small tenant of around 10 people, that I very sporadically give support to, before doing the same on other tenants.
 MFA and SSPR were already setup before. No Conditional Access available (only using M365 Business Standard).
 The instructions on this page are pretty good and easy to follow. Essentially, I enabled and configured the methods that were being used before in either MFA or SSPR.
 I do have a doubt though. At the end of article, it says:
  
Finish the migration 
 After you update the Authentication methods policy, go through the legacy MFA, and SSPR policies and remove each authentication method one-by-one. Test and validate the changes for each method.
  
So I followed through and cleared all the methods and saved successfully.
  
MFA service settings - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER
 Password reset | Authentication methods - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER
  
​
 My question is:
 In the new policy (screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/kV4xITt.png ), where is it being defined which methods are available to users willing to self reset their password ? This was very easy to understand in the previous "Password reset | Authentication methods" page but now I'm a little bit confused.
 ​
 Edit: cleared text, added new screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in IT for almost 20 years now since leaving university and looking for my next role and relaised I have a huge lack of professional qualifications which is hampering my search. Currently I run the IT systems years for a small finance company in London (35 people), and I've been there over 6 years now. While I like the variety, challenge and autonomy, things like professional development and training haven't been forthcoming which has left me with no recent professional qualifications.
 My CV currently only lists ITIL Foundation v3 as a professional certification, which is now woefully out of date, but I feel like at least ITIL hasn't changed that much. I have however, made the choice to omit all of MS certifcations from 10 years ago as it really doesn't look great to have things like Server 2008 and SQL 2012 listed given how dated they are now.
 So my question is this, given that my free time is limited like most people, which are the best certifications to get which are fairly short 1-2 day courses and fairly cheap, while also providing good prospects for future roles, and a good line to have on my CV and LinkedIn. Ideally in the realms of cyber security, change management and the Azure Cloud.
 My initial thoughts are
 Cyber Essentials
 ISO 27001
 MS Partner courses in the more advanced areas of Azure Load balancing and cloud server migration.
 Maybe looking into upgrading to ITIL v4
 Change management courses
 ​
 I would love some feedback and suggestions, thanks!

 I have taken over the responsibility to secure our hardware setup, and as it is right now it is all just a bunch of computers in 12 different stores and 2 offices + 70 laptops users can loan.
 Most of the pc's are used as Cash registers. 
 My plan was to do the following:
  
TeamViewer on all computers for easy support
 TeamViewer Monitor to secure pc's are up to date and secure
 SpiceWorks agent for Inventory
 Create Admin account on all pc's and create a user account for the users
  
How would you all handle this?

 Now before you bust out the flamethrowers, I understand NIS is insecure; but I've taken on this project and I've been working on a FreeIPA replacement.. In the meantime everything continues to function well, till last Friday.
 Last Friday I get a call from one of the research professors mentioning that access to the HPC has gone down. I check and see that the NIS client on the HPC cluster can no longer communicate with the NIS server. So I do some tests:

 It's essentially controlling items in other people's calendars which I don't think is possible. Ttelling everyone to just hit the Holiday button in Options doesn't cut it. I've tried creating and sending an all day event to my test calendar but it doesn't prevent the recipient from hitting the Decline button. It's also nothing short of cumbersome.
 I don't think there is a practical solution, but there might be other methods I haven't thought of. So... open to ideas if anyone has attempted this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope all are well,
 ​
 I'll start by explaining the dilemma I'm currently facing;
 I have a client who has slightly under 1 million folders/files in a single SharePoint site.
 They have had syncing issues for a fair bit of time now. Syncing from the explorer to the cloud
 can take anywhere from 5minutes-1 hour (sometimes many more or not at all).
 ​
 I have tested with a brand new SharePoint site with instant syncing (just to confirm it has nothing to do with the environment).
 ​
 Anyway, so my question is how common is 1 single SharePoint site for the entire business? How many files is technically "too many" regardless of what MS claims it can handle.
 I'm planning on rebuilding the SharePoint structure into individual sites per folder below;
 Jobs
 Quotes
 Projects
 Accounting
 Management
 Etc.
 ​
 I know I'm not Houdini and this is standard but it'll lead up to my second question;
 I'm having a hell of a time splitting the files since I keep reaching "File count over limit".
 Any PowerShell scripts that have worked for you guys moving larger folders?
 I have tried a few different scripts but to no avail unfortunately.
 ​
 Any tricks would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

So far a small group of users (2 or 3) are experiencing freezing whenever they receive an email via Outlook or Teams. We’re running M365 with exchange online. The freeze lasts roughly as long as the desktop notification then stops. We switched to M365 roughly 6 months ago, and this issue happened within the past 2 weeks. Now one thing thst happened was thst the feature preview caused the app bar at the bottom of the nav lane to move to the left side. That and us switching to FS Logix to replace roaming profiles are the only real changes that I know of. As far as troubleshooting goes I’ve disabled notifications for anything to show on desktop, rebuilt the local profile, rebuilt the outlook profile, disabled the updated apps bar, and no dice. I have not noticed this on the physical machine, only when removing via Citrix storefront to use RDP, or use the Citrix Desktop. We’re using on prem AD, Citrix VDA to support multiple users to one server, I’m one of the users effected. If anyone has any ideas or needs any clarification I am an open book ask me and I’ll answer. Thank you all for your help!!

 I got an account which is Google Workspace Business Starter. This gives me 30gb per user. In the past, if a user needed 100gb or more, in the storage section, the account could be upgraded for an extra amount per month or year. Google has killed off this feature.
 The only way forward is upgrading to Workspace business standard, which gives a 2Tb pooled storage. However, this also doubles the user/month cost, which does not sit well with the board. (Moving the whole business off the Google account is a nightmare I don't really want to face). 
 What other external storage options do you guys use? 
 Basically external storage, cloud or self hosted, not looking at OneDrive or Dropbox, as I'm hoping there is something that would be possible to integrate with Google drive.

 @Netflix: To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon… we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned. We're filming it now and we'll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry.
 Love is Blind is doing a live event. ~Apparently this is their first live event / episode.~ this is not the first live event.
 Servers are down, no one can connect. They communicated 15 minutes until online and now it's been 20.
 Oof.
 Update: 28 minutes in and still down
 Update 2: 43 minutes in, still down. The hosts posted an update on Instagram saying they're working on it still
 Update 3: 57 minutes in, still down. Maybe they have an internal go live at 6pm pst, one hour in?
 Update 4: 62 minutes in, still down. We're in this for the long haul. This is bad lmao especially since they have the cast there just awkwardly waiting until they can stream it live
 Update 5: 75 minutes in, still down. All influencers are now streaming from their Instagram accounts and it looks like chaos
 Update 6: POSSIBLE FIX: PLAY THE EPISODE 12 AND FAST FORWARD TO THE ENDING. THEN ITLL SAY NEXT EPISODE AND PLAY
 Update 7: Well, it played for about 2 minutes live and then crashed again
 I was able to get in after 86 minutes. Now I can't get in again. Some people are streaming it off their phone on TikTok and IG
 apparently Netflix canceled the live stream and they're just recording it to post later. Not sure how true this is but it seems it is, they're going ahead with the event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BGP novice here. Our growing company will soon be opening a secondary office/datacenter in a different geographic region. Our primary site/headquarters is currently single-homed and uses provider-assigned IP addresses, but will soon be multi-homed and our new site will be multi-homed from day one. Each site will be served by local ISPs that do not operate outside their respective regions. We will be getting full BGP tables from each ISP.
 Each site will have unique IPv6/IPv4 prefixes. There will be VPN tunnels between the two sites, but no direct/dedicated connectivity.
 Would there be any advantages to having a separate ASN for each site? Would there be any disadvantages other than additional RIR fees?
 I am aware of something that Cisco calls "neighbor allow-as". Would we need to use something like that if the two sites share an ASN, or would the simple fact that they are announcing unique prefixes ensure that their use of a shared ASN doesn't get treated as a BGP loop?
 If it matters, we hope to implement RPKI from the start and we wouldn't want the secondary site to have a ROA (Route Origin Authorization) that would allow it to announce prefixes used by the headquarters or vice versa. (Such as could happen accidentally due to misconfiguration, or if the site were to suffer a security breach.) My cursory understanding is that we will be able to have distinct ROAs for each site with only the prefixes assigned to that site, but I it would be great if someone could confirm that for me.
 Thanks in advance for any insight!

 In addition to this, I was hoping you could help with the best option out of these 3, this would be in addition to requiring a network connection to the devices.

 The article below describes how the Fortigate VM may be trying to reach the Azure fabric at 168.63.129.16 incorrectly over an internal port instead of correctly over the external facing port.
 https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-FortiGate-Azure-showing-virtual-machine-agent-not/ta-p/214315
 That all makes sense - until the last part of the article. It suggests that if an internal or external load balancer is used ( it is in our case we use both ) then 2 static routes to the Azure fabric are needed - one to the internal port and one to the external.
 We have that in place and still we have an error.
 Thing is i can't get my head around why a static route to 168.63.129.16 internal port is needed as well as a static route to 168.63.129.16 over the external port. It makes no sense.
 Any suggestions much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am nearing 4,5 years at my current job. It is getting tiresome. We are a small company with a boss with too big an ego. Why? As we are a cloud provider, I must do nearly everything you can imagine. So networking, backup, virtualization, storage, web, Linux, windows, mail, web servers, and the list goes on and on. It is like I do something new every day, even after more than 4 years, it is like I never get to the point I can say, yes, now I am really good at this topic. Besides this I am also doing other jobs here, non-IT related.
 My boss, now, came to the brilliant idea we can also do pen-testing as well. Just like that. Without some outside training. Just search how and do it. Not to mention he also ****** over employees if they leave.
 Oh and the hours, some months they seem without end. Like now...migrate exchange to some open source software. Search, try, implement, test, troubleshoot, document, etc.
 I am getting tired. Next week it is possible I will receive an offer, Linux job, a bit less pay, but better benefits.
 I am also afraid to change, Stockholm syndrome?
 I am tired.

Our WISP uses OSPF for our IGB, but it's starting to show it's limitations due to the size of our network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to lack of availability of high-speed (2.5Gb, 10Gbit) small switches with the right combination of features from our usual enterprise brands, it's been suggested that we could consider an inversion of sorts, trunking through inexpensive but higher-speed unmanaged switches at the core and still use enterprise PoE+ switches at the edge.
 The idea currently is that all traffic going through the "dumb core" would be VLAN tagged; anything plugging into the core would be VLAN-aware. Besides the edge switches, the core would have at least one NAS and several Macs, for high-speed media sharing workflows.
 As an unusual architecture, I have zero doubt that /r/networking will love it immediately. Assuming that we're not going to have any end-users able to plug anything into the core and looping it up, what's the pro/con and has anyone run this in production?

I love technology but I'm struggling to see the benefits. The only thing I've found that is remotely objective is that PoE is low voltage and therefore, does not require conduits to be run for lighting. After factoring the cost of switches and maintenance of switches, Im not sure this is still a benefit. Is there a real benefit to PoE lighting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story very short. I've been a sysadmin since around 1995 in various sectors, even in the past 10 years when I moved into cybersec I've still been in charge of huge chunk of our infrastucture as this was seen as an advantage when we had any incidents - I was familiar with it.
 I'm moving into a new role in May and while is almost triple my current salary I can't help but feel nervous as it's completely focused on cybersec, I've taken the jump as frankly I can't work under my new boss who's just a disaster waiting to happen.
 Any tips? I think it's likely impostor syndrome, I was headhunted for this role so I'm trying to see that as a vote of confidence.
 Perhaps some of this is guilt, since I put my notice in my entire team have quit or are working their notice too so we'll be leaving my current employer without a cyber sec team at all (8 staff gone in <2 months).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: This post is geared towards those working in Government with air gapped networks.
 I noticed after upgrading to Windows 11 22H2 from Windows 10 20H2/21H2 some vulnerabilities (Nessus) appeared for apps like 3D viewer, Paint 3D and the new Windows Terminal. This is because these are Microsoft Store Apps that require updates.
 If you're in an air-gapped environment this proves difficult as everything points to GitHub, third party sites, or a license to get an Appx installer for offline networks. It's possible to update these apps but if your workplace is very hard set on risk avoidance instead of remediation you can remove these applications with PowerShell.
 You'll need to utilize the Remove-AppxPackage and Remove-ProvisionedAppxPackage Cmdlet to "uninstall" the Appx. 
 Nessus showed vulnerabilities for these apps afterwards because the Windows app directory exist for the vulnerable Appx here: C:\Program Files\WindowsApps. You'll need to remove the Directory related to the removed Appx. I've only had luck removing these directories by running as SYSTEM via MECM.
 Something to note, if you remove the WindowsApps Appx Directory before running the PowerShell commands above you will not be able to remove the Appx with PowerShell.

 Configure AppLocker to restrict software running on the jump boxes.
 Require smart card authentication to login to the jumpboxes.
 Add licenses to the jump boxes so more than 2 admins can login at a time.

 Im new as sysadmin, and i have checked alot of resources to resolve this but no luck. Hope that you guys can guide me through this step.
 So basically, users cannot install apps without an admin permission. Risk has just raised a point that they are able to download and run portable applications. I have been assigned to block that.
 In our environment, we are using ManageEngine Central, i thought of uaing that to implement this policy, but there was no such option. The optiones offered by GPO is to block specific application installation by either name of hash, i need it to be general for all portable apps.
 I have imported a full list of all applications installed in our environment, thought of creating a whitelist and prohibiting any other application, but no luck in that as well as im not sure which solution to use to enforce this scenario.
 The department is willing to purchase a solution and implement it to control such aspects, as security has a magnificent intrest of the management. Please let me know if any solution provides this capability.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning!
 Recently some tickets have been showing up and being escalated to me about users who can't open excel spreadsheets on a file share because they are locked by an unknown user. When I check Open Files on the file share I can see who has them open. Well, I asked the user if they could close out of the spreadsheet if they were done and they replied that they didn't even have it open. Sure enough there was no lock file in the directory either. If I kill the open file, then another user can open it but this problem repeats itself randomly.
 I'm starting to think it's a share permission or drive permission that's causing this but everything looks good... Is there a way to analyze permissions through directory trees (like see an overview of what the user has permissions to do starting from the root of the share) or is this something else entirely? I've googled like a madman and everything just says to remove lock files or close it from Open Files on the server itself.

 Hope this makes sense. Renewed the RootCA cert on a 2 tier install last week.
 I renewed the offline Root CA. No issues here. Took files and copied them over to SubCA and the other server where IIS is running. Did the certutil DSpublish command on the crt file and crl file. Command ran ok and says added to the DS store.
 When I look in pkiview though I have an error on the root level for AIA Location #2. Says Unable to download. The path is correct but it has the old RootCa crt file name listed and not the new one. Everything on the SubCA in PKIView shows OK and the AIA has the new root (3) file listed etc just fine.
 AIA Location #2 Unable to Download http://pki.domain.com/crl/name1(2).crt.crt) and it should be name1(3).crt.
 Both the old RootCA cert (2) and the new (3) exist at that path and I can see them when browsing to that location in a browser and both files will download fine.
 If I go into Manage AD Containers , the new renewed root ca cert shows up under Certificate Authorities Container tab as well as the AIA Container tab correctly. I cannot figure out why everything appears ok, but the file name is not updated in the pki path to the new cert name and it says unable to download. Both the old file (2) and new one (3) have the same permissions.
 What would cause that, and how can I change it? I have done this twice in the past and not encountered this.

 Is an offline backup just a backup of the VHDX not in a running state?

 Currently I’m the IT person on the project team handling SSO and user provisioning and I can wholeheartedly say that they leave a really bad impression in every possible way so far. Their in-house consultants are absolutely clueless and the processes are archaic. I am just in shock after every meeting.
  
You want SSO? Create a ticket and someone in a completely different time zone will not read your request properly and it will take days to sort things out.
 What does the user status “Parked” and “Terminated” mean? No clue. One “consultant” went so far as to suggest to read F1 help - which of course did not help.
 What should be considered when choosing a user ID? Silence.
 Generally they can maybe answer about 10% of the questions, for the rest they need to ask someone else. Sometimes they even get back to you after that.
  
It’s a bit of a nightmare and other departments engaging with different consultants share that feeling. Curious what your experience is. Or does just every ERP implementation suck?

 Here looking for advice on what to do, with an emphasis on security obviously. Should i buy 5 say Dells and centrally manage them with something like InTune. 
 No central office as such and all work remotely, so any recommendation on software for providing remote support like ConnectWise or Bomgar but looking ideally for something not expensive at the moment.

Was working toward the AZ-104 when I sort of got side tracked with PowerShell and have been focusing on that almost exclusively, currently working through the book 'PowerShell in Action', but I have moments of wondering if it's a bit overkill since it is a substantially deeper lever than anywhere near what is needed in my environment. 
 Still definitely have AZ-104 on my radar as well as eventually trying to learn Python, as I do not currently know any other languages. 
 My lack of networking knowledge/experience has made me consider pursuing a CCNA, but really I don't know if I have an interest in being a networking engineer outside of some of the salaries that I see. 
 I know. It's not all about money. But when you are in your early 30s with 2 kids and nothing meaningful saved up for retirement it does start to be about money. Looking for the biggest return on my time investment and am struggling to develop a concrete plan going forward for the next 5-10 years. 
 Please help.

But AppLocker works on any current cumulative update for Win11 and Win10 Pro, even if managed by group policy - it no longer requires Enterprise.
 So this is actually a massive improvement over needing to use SRPs, but Microsoft never really announced SRPs would stop being enforced so it's a security risk if you don't know to roll out AppLocker.
 The article on AppLocker being enabled for all editions is referring to some older updates but a lot of people are reporting it didn't start working until more recently. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5024351-removal-of-windows-edition-checks-for-applocker-e3a763c9-6a3e-4d9c-8623-0ffe69046470

 I slotted in the new blade and saw it's firmware was higher than the CMC firmware so the CMC needed to be updated. 
 Got the CMC updated to the latest firmware; however, the internal nics will not come up to allow the blade access to external network. 
 Nics are all enabled on the R1-2401 and I can see blades one and 2 have all of their nics active, but this new blade will not bring them up. I've even gone into the switch an shut/no shut the ports to see if that would bring them up and nadda.

 Any thoughts? I'm not very familiar with the old VRTX chassis

 I don't understand why the default assumption is that any cold outreach is not possibly worth considering. I occasionally work with IT directors/managers but usually non-technical decision makers, and typically if I can provide a valid reason for why I wanted to reach out to them, they are happy to hear the 10 second version, provide a maybe or no, then potentially book a meeting.
 I'm biased, but it seems insane to me to assume anyone who emails you twice should be blocked - how do you know it's not a good product or service? Your job depends on sales and marketing too, you wouldn't be employed if sales and marketing teams at your company weren't pitching plenty of good products and services, the level of vitriol doesn't compute to me?

 ​
 Hello Everyone,
 I'm working on migrating all the DLs of the organisation across all the locations.
 So we have DLs with the domain [admin@oranges.com](mailto:admin@oranges.com) and newly created DLs with [admin@apples.com](mailto:admin@apples.com) domain.
 I am looking to convert all of them to [admin@apples.com](mailto:admin@apples.com).
 My plan is :
  
export all the DLs via PS in CSV (How would I do that)
 Remove new DLs (as they are already in the new domain) and teams groups (someone told me it will also show private teams groups).
 Add @ apples.com domain to the DLs.
 Make @ apples.com domain as primary domain.
  
Is it how am I suppose to do or is there any better idea?
 To approximately 50 most used DLs, I migrated them manually, also renamed as it had old company name in the Display name.
 Now I can't think of texting individual DL owners to see if they are still in use, so I am just thinking of migrating all of them.
 Please help how would go about this, any help is appreciated.

 I'm starting a position with an IT team in a museum soon and I'm wondering if anybody here has any experience in this exact environment?
 I'm looking for any prerequisites it's be worth me doing or if there's anything about working in a museum that'll be significantly different from your standard office environment. 
 It's primarily working with MS365, Active Directory, ticket management.
 Thanks in advance

 This was confirmed when the functionality was restored after uninstalling KB5025221.
 ​
 I'm pretty sure scanners and copiers are something that is still used in some office settings so this this information maybe valuable to someone.
 ​
 If you have a brother multi-function printer that includes a document scanner and you keep getting an error scanner is not connecting you can always try removing this update and see if it starts working again for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me say, I am not network smart at all.
 Currently my company advocates for static IP at the printers. We had some printers get moved around and lost their connections. I was told is because the new ports are not on the same subnet. I have no idea what that means but it sounded cool. 
 The other thing that is going on, the network guys want to subnet for printers and other collections. This means we have to re-IP all printers.
 I suggested that we us hostnames/FQDN for printers and it was like I was talking about someone religion, or their parents, or the best motor oil. 
 It seems to me if we go with a standard host naming convention and connected to those printers via FQDN rather than IP, things would run a lot smoother and the network chasers can re-IP all they want. 
 what is/are the best business practices here, short of chaining the printers to the wall?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 7606-S with RSP720 that had an ESM card (7600-ES20-GE3C). In the process of replacing it with a 7600 ES+ card (76-ES+XC-20G3C) I had both in the chassis and pretty much copy pasted the config for each interface in use and unplugged the cables and SFPs from the old card and plugged them into the new one.
 Apr 15 10:24:24 EST: %TRANSCEIVER-3-OPER_ENABLE_FAILURE: Detected for transceiver module in GigabitEthernet4/10, module disabled 
 Some SFPs were disabled. A few SFPs, I only noticed after I took another look at them are actually DS-SFP-GE-T, not SFP-GE-T.
 I added service unsupported-transceiver and no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid, but it made no difference.
 Is there no workaround for this? In the first place, what is DS-SFP-GE-T?? It doesn't show up in the Cisco transceiver compatibility tool, DS makes me think mds9000 maybe? But it worked without complaint in the older linecard while it won't work even with unsupported-transceiver in the ES+ one. 
 Right now I have both still installed until I probably end up getting the right SFPs, wondering if this was to be expected, on switches the hidden commands pretty much let you use any standard SFP with a scary warning prompt but on this platform it didn't even show me the warning, though it didn't have any effect either.

 Wondering if anyone has dealt with this issue and how they approached it. We have a few users who are being constantly locked out by brute force attempts (about 50 attempts every hour). The users have MFA so we aren't too concerned about them gaining access but finding it frustrating having to constantly unlock the accounts. We have conditional access policies in place but because the conditional access takes effect after first factor it doesn't prevent the lockout. I have reached out to our Contact at Microsoft for some advice also but thought I would check in here as well for any other ideas
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm experimenting with Telnet in a home lab setting, I'd like to connect to another machine from my main laptop and I'm having the following issue: I get the message “Connecting to 192.168.0.62… Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”.
 Here is a breakdown.
 ​
  
I want to connect with Laptop 1 to Laptop 2.
 Laptop 1: Windows 10 / IP address 192.168.0.55.
 Laptop 2: Windows 10 / IP address 192.168.0.62.
 Both are connected to the same wireless network.
 When attempting to use Telnet on Laptop 1 to connect to Laptop 2, I get the following message in CMD, with admin privileges, “Connecting to 192.168.0.62… Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”. 
 Telnet client is activated on both machines.
 Firewall settings on Laptop 1 enable me to use Telnet. I tested this and was able to connect to another machine, a Linux laptop, on the same network, without any issue. I totally disabled the firewall on Laptop 2, and I’m still having issues when using Telnet.
 I can connect to Laptop 2 using RDP on Laptop 1.
 Rebooting did not solve the issue.
 
  
Has anyone run into this issue before or have any suggestions? Cheers!

 Long:
 I recently dealt with a website that was compromised. There was a credit card stealer script embedded on the webserver. The script was caught by our antivirus software on a user PC they they went to buy something on this website. My user raised a ticket and I investigated. I knew nothing about this vendor of ours besides the domain. I queried the domain registrar for the owner email address and got the private registration proxy one. Armed with this information I fired a quick email to the following addresses about the security incident:
  
Registrar proxy
 abuse@
 security@
 webmaster@
 hostmaster@
 support@ 
  
The IT team of the vendor resolved the issue and I got a thank you email from them.
 However, of all these, only the webmaster@ address worked, the rest bounced back. I have come across this more frequently as new generation of sysadmins xome onboard, they don't know about this. So please, setup an alias or shared mailbox to monitor these accounts!

 I've configured my domain controllers, servers & clients to use LAN Manager Authentication Level : Send NTLMv2 response only, Refuse LM & NTLM.
 I've double checked everything, even in the registry LSA -> Lmcompatibility is 5. 
 If I look into the domain controllers security event viewer, I still see pretty much events with NTLM v1 successful logons (event 4624). I think that this is because of certain computers which aren't using the FQDN to connect to a share. 
 I'm just worried why it still shows me NTLM v1.... All the devices are W10, W11 & W2016 and as I understood, it should enforce NTLM v2.
 Do I miss something ?

 When i try to connect i see exactly one packet on port 500 on mikrotik's counter for firewall rules, well, NAT rules in this case and that's it, nothing more, the phone i'm testing this with gives up and states "disconnected", the whole process take 1-2 seconds. 
 I really have 0 idea what i did wrong.

 I am working on an assignment which basically has the question of identifying an exploit with a relevant CVE that would allow for TCP session identification. The closest I could find to this was CVE-1999-0667 with ARP spoofing, where the cache is poisoned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
 I am however confused, as I do not know if this constitutes as an exploit or just a technique within an exploit. I tried my hardest to skim through thousands of CVEs to see if there were any exploits related to the identification of TCP sessions, but most of them were just denial-of-service attacks.
 I would appreciate some clarification on this topic because I am just so lost

As I was waiting on the phone for support I plugged in the redundant power into a less loose pdu and BAM!!! no packet loss across the board. Is this an rma issue or have I missed something?

 I get that a SYN/ACK would be used in this case over a proxy server, but is that it? I am unsure if I am missing an extra step here, but from what I understand, the target host replying with its on SYN/ACK confirms it is alive. After this, I do not know if the scanner host would send a RST or an ACK to the target network.

And you guessed it, no password logs anywhere. I see that there is a process with a serial cable to reset the admin password but it also notes that it erases the data on the system. I have been asked to retrieve some of the data on this unit so I don’t think I should do that. Does anyone know of any other options? 
 Also, I cant seem to find any technical documentation on this unit. With the WD and DDN acquisitions I have no idea where to get any documentation….. or what support number I can call. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve been working with WSUS for the last 6yrs now with plenty of headaches I’d like to get rid of. So I’m reaching out to find some other patch management suggestions. We are a small business, I’m sure we can manage about 5k/yr but I’m trying to find something a little lower on the cost side if any. Also, if the solution could inventory the machines and present what patches are needed by machines (similar to WSUS), that would be a bonus. So what do you all have for me?

The link, if you have it, is https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?ref=MessageCenter/:/messages/MC541626 If you don't have it, here are the screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/qVMQxbl
 Basically it's a new feature coming where when you click a link in an email in Outlook on Windows, it opens Edge with a copy of the email as a side panel. Sounds kind of neat.
 But to make sure everyone experiences this, Outlook will also start ignoring your system's default web browser and opening links in Edge no matter what. Users whose default has always been Chrome, and whose bookmarks and saved passwords are all in Chrome, will be highly confused by a very similar-looking browser that has none of their stuff. They'll probably call the helpdesk screaming "why did you delete all my stuff?!?!"
 The user can change this in settings, but options being offered for admins to shut this off is lacking. Both options listed (the cloud policy service and group policy) explicitly apply only to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (not business).
 So, for SMBs there seems to be no way out besides manually touching each machine. Of course, it remains to be seen if perhaps the end-user setting is in a registry key instead of some secret place... we can only hope...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week my employer (a large robotics company) hired an MSP to work as our help desk. We had a different MSP for 10 years but due to some contract negotiation differences, we could not come to an agreement. The new MSP needed Jump boxes in the environment to use as administration systems to work from. 
 ​
 They requested 18 boxes 1 for each person. the box requested was a server 2016+ and local admin rights plus rights to have basic administration of DNS, DHCP, etc. We provided the boxes and the accounts. 
 ​
 Today (yay Friday!) I happen to refresh my server manager and find a few new ADCS boxes. So I looked at all servers on the network to find what roles were installed. I found many jump boxes had ADCS, ADFS, ADDS, DHCP, DNS, and ADLDS. etc. Many even had LDS instances. 
 ​
 I contacted the Helpdesk manager and asked why these servers have these roles installed when they are only meant for jump boxes and they didn't follow the documented change management process. 
 He then proceeded to respond "We needed these so we could administrate these services on the servers," I asked him why they didn't use RSAT because installing these roles leaves the environment up to more risks. He seemed surprised at the existence of RSAT. 
 ​
 I am very frustrated that the MSP would install and configure critical roles on jump boxes in the environment but I am also Dumbfounded that the basic tools for administration seemed to be unknown to them and it makes me question their knowledge. They to me seem to be a huge risk at this point.

 The vast majority of users send MAYBE 1 ticket a week, and are very relaxed but in any company I have worked for there is always a small handful of individuals who have an issue every other day. its always an emergency and the ticket is so vague that you always have to spend 4 emails just to figure out what the problem is.
 The week started with it was "Excel not working" < The application was working fine, the issue was that they incorrectly formatted an excel formula. 
 Wednesday (8am): "Cant connect, please assist" < Turns out they decided to WFH, knows damn well we disable VPN accounts inactive for 2 weeks, and neglected to advise us. 
 Thursday it was: "My computer isn't working, tried restart" < This one was actually an issue, But I checked task manager and they did not reboot the machine, in 5 days. A reboot fixed the issue
 just now, Friday 4PM "The scanner needs to be cleaned" *send PHOTO of a screen with a notification* saying "IF your scanned doc has vertical lines it needs to be cleaned". 22 minutes later I am still waiting to see a document that has vertical lines. The scanned document is FINE...
 The most hilarious part of this is they claim to have taken a post secondary I.T course.
 Have a good weekend everyone

 Our current environment is Windows Server and laptop based using local AD synced to Azure and Exchange Online.
 My co-worker in IT, which also turns out to be a middle manager, wants to transition the company (small to medium sized) from Windows based laptops to Chromebooks. My co-worker believes there will be less maintenance of the devices themselves such as constantly dealing with driver issues (Dell), plus they're much cheaper. 
 Obviously we'd have to virtualize any app so it can be accessible through a browser, which only would be a couple or so, and we'd have to start managing the devices via MDM. We would keep Exchange Online and Azure for email and authentication. 
 I'm trying my hardest to keep an open mind about this as I do not want to be a hinderance to new ideas, and this would fall mostly on me to make this transition happen, at least infrastructure wise.
 I would just like to know what any of y'all think of the idea of transitioning to Chromebook based laptops/tablets.

Working with a new var on upgrading an asr9910, requirements for the card ports are 6 40 gig ports and a handful of 10 gig with the possibility of upgrading two 40 gig ports to 100. A quote for a a9k-8hg-flex-fc was coming out to 174k per card with a 177k license per card for a 400g license which seems high. An original quote for a 400g line card with the bare minimum ports was about 60k each and 60 for the license. Is this just obnoxiously high or just cisco? Anyone have similar quotes from juniper or nokia? Those would be a full chassis quote at this point. The total bw on the backplane doesn’t go above 200g with a potential of upgrading to 3-340g.

 You already have procured the replacements and they are sitting in your storage.
 How long from receiving the roster to replacement should it roughly take to accomplish?

If I set my "Configure authorized password decryptors" gpo to use a group like mydomain\LAPS Admins when I run Get-LapsADPassword it tells me I'm unauthorized to decrypt the password even though I'm in that group. If I instead set the gpo to mydomain\myuser instead of the group it works fine, but then my other admins can't decrypt though, anyone else run into this issue and know a fix?
 Edit: Thanks for the replies, it was just another case of being impatient. Went and did something else for 30 minutes or so and checked again and I could read the password fine with the group assignment.

 (for instance, teaming 2 NICs for a vmware vSwitch)
 Speed? Reliability? Load balancing for some reason?
 The reason i ask is that i have teamed NICs for the vSwitches in a few esx servers, but mostly because thats how it was set up on the first esx server i saw.
 I dont think that teaming two 1gbit NICs gives much better speed (for me, here).
 Both NICs are connected to the same switch, and the router mostly only has 1gbit NICs anyway, so i dont think much traffic would go over that limit anyway.
 And yeah, both NICs are connected to the same switch, so if that breaks its bye bye anyway.
 But yeah, i get some redundancy if one port on that dual-port card breaks i guess.
 Anyway, when you team NICs, do you always make sure they are connected to separate switches?
 And what more to think of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, I've seen many debates about the value of certs.
 Just 3.5 months into my full-time career, I've landed a 'Senior Network & Security Analyst' role, and I believe truly having my CCNA helped A TON.
 First off, the last thing I'm trying to do here is brag/gloat. This is an anonymous forum and no-one knows me here. Simply trying to share my experience so that it can hopefully help others.
 For background, I have 1 year (three 4 month co-ops) internship experience, and have been working at my full time role for 3.5 months.
 Before anyone says anything about the 'validity' of the role/company, my new company is a huge employer and big bank.
 I understand this is Reddit and you should take my post with a grain of salt. You might have huge skepticism over if this is a true post or not.
 Luck/timing plays a big role. Clearly I don't have 'senior' level experience, but I do interview well, do have some work experience, but most importantly, I have my CCNA and DevNet, along with some network automation projects I listed on my resume (and no, not just simple projects from school. These are my own individual projects). I believe these factors were a massive help in me landing the role (the role said CCNP would be a nice-to-have and that automation experience was a plus).
 Another myth I want to shatter is about applying to jobs 'out of your league'. Again, by all accounts I should not have landed the role as I am only 3.5 months into my full-time career. But clearly there weren't too many eligible candidates and my new employer is deciding to take a chance on me.
 So just apply to any and every job that catches your eye. And there is absolutely no arbitrary 'time' you have to stay at a job before you want to move. I am the proof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on upgrading our switches to IBNS 2.0 config and up till now I've had little to no issues.
 We have mostly 3850s with a handful of 9XXX series switch's and just a few 2960c's
 I think I'm running into a bug with these ones. We have the port template use a parked vlan (666) and we do vlan assignment via ISE policy. When I try to do this on this switch it seems to tear down the mab session and repeat it forever. ISE logs show repeated successes and the debugs show successful vlan, dacl and SGT assignment but then immediately tear down and start over. My work around has been to just blow out the template onto the port statically as well as set the vlan statically everything works fine if I do that. and I'm fine with keeping it that way for now. However I'd still like to know. I'm likely to put in a tac case today but I'd figure I'd share in case anyone else is in my boat. 
 I've got a switch on my desk with more or less the same config and I'm unable to replicate the issue at least most of the time. Although I don't have 100% the same endpoints to test with.
 anyway here is the switch facts:
 WS-C2960C-8PC-L 15.2(7)E7 C2960c405-UNIVERSALK9-M

 Running config: https://pastebin.com/ETUVA3JU
 Debug of an example endpoint:
 debug radius authentication
 debug epm all
 debug radius verbose
 debug ip device tracking interface

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wondering what the preferred setup for this is. We currently have a DMZ that is all on one VLAN. I got the directive to prevent east/west. The two easiest solutions I could come up with are switch it to a PVLAN or setup the host firewalls and just block traffic from the DMZ subnet. Harder solution would be split the VLAN up which would require readdressing the servers.
 Since I don't manage the servers, I think the PVLAN is the best solution I could implement. Anyone have their DMZ setup like this? Any downsides or concerns I may be overlooking? Most use-cases I see when researching are for segmenting customer traffic or guest networks.

 What are some of the jobs/things/operations you do on a daily/weekly/monthly basis and deem as standard or normal that would be a reason for a pay raise.
 Im bad at explaining this but i need bullet points i can hit with so that i can argue why i need a raise. 
 I do all the normal stuff a ~10000 user networking engineer/professional does, but im looking at things i might have overlooked but can be classified as specialized work.
 I feel like this is harder than nessecary, as daily upkeepings and tickets keeps rolling in they dont nessecarily keep increasing in complexity, but the hole of everything still gets expanded daily. 
 Again. Just looking at pointers and maybe even normal operations that may be deemed as things to be taking with me in negotiations in the next conversation.

This is because, even aside of packet drops, there could be some other problems (if I recall correctly, related to ARP resolution) that may fail connection on the first ping, but succeed on subsequent ones.
 Some facts (all of this is true with default parameters): * When in Windows I ping something it runs 4 pings. * When in Linux I ping something it pings continuously. * When in PowerShell I use Test-Connection it runs 4 pings. * When in PowerShell I use Test-NetConnection it runs one ping (validated with WireShark).
 Question: Can someone tell me if that networking engineer was right?
 Bonus question: If that networking engineer was right, does that mean that Test-NetConnection is a bad command?
 (Please don’t dig deep into command parameters, ports etc. - the question is about icmp)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running into a weird problem at my new temp office. We moved into a shared office space with another business, we are both using Shaw as our provider, me with the business plan and them with the home plan. As soon as I arrive at the office and connect to our company WiFi me and the guy across from me (other business) start dropping connection. Sometimes we drop connection a few times a day, sometimes I can only maintain connection for 2-3 minutes at a time, dropping connection intermittently. Our SSID's are on different channels, and our modems are both running through the same coax cable with a splitter. My company is running a Meraki for WiFi with the modem bridged, they are connecting directly to their modem. Does anyone have any idea why our WiFi would be interfering with each other?

 Identicly deployed the 365 apps for enterprise to roughly 25 RDS session hosts via ODT, all working fine bar one host which is refusing to activate any users licence, after signing in with an appropriately licenced user or users I still get the big dirty ' (non commercial use) (unlicenced Product)' across the top.
 ​
  
I can't see any firewall issue, local windows firewall is disabled like the other hosts, and I can't see anything stopping the traffic, it is in the same network as the other working session hosts.
 I have tried usual reinstall/repairs both online and offline.
 Redeploy via ODT again it installs again ok but fails to activate.
 tried clearing credential manager.
 Tried running the support and recovery assitant tool.
 https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant-for/29323f9a-899b-4d08-b21d-ca697c7594c0
 running the clean up scripts provided by MS:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/activation/reset-office-365-proplus-activation-state#sectionb
 Verified the registry value for shared licensing is set to 1.
 I am able to get to the sign in prompt, but it doesn't go anything with the creds, no username is registered so I can returned the sign in option again.
  
​
 Just wondering if anyone has come accross a really obscure answer to this one?
 ​
 Any suggestions appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone,
 Sorry if this isn't quite the right sub for this post. I have a question about a setup I came across at a small business. I didn't set it up, but the current setup doesn't really make sense to me so I'd like some help understanding.
 The business has two DSL connections. The first one is their internet connection. 
 The second one is just creating a secure connection to a remote server that they need to access. The remote server they are accessing is at 100.100.0.1. This DSL modem is expecting a client to connect on port LAN4 at a client IP of 100.50.50.254, with a default gateway of 100.50.50.1. If I connect my laptop to LAN4, assign a static IP of 100.50.50.254, and a default gateway of 100.50.50.1, I can ping 100.100.0.1 no problem. That all makes sense. 
 They are using a Cisco RV042G as their primary Router/Firewall. This router has a WAN port and a WAN/DMZ port. Currently it is configured in WAN + DMZ mode. 
 The WAN port is connected to their first DSL modem, the modem is in Bridge Mode, and the router is setup to login using PPPoe. All internet traffic is routed through this connection.
 In the settings for the DMZ port, it has the option to select a subnet or range. Subnet is selected, and an IP of 100.50.50.254 is inputted in there. There is then a static route setup for 100.100.0.1, to be routed out the DMZ Interface. 
 My understanding is the DMZ port as configured is supposed to be used to give a direct internet connection to a specific device, keeping it seperate from your LAN, and bypassing all firewall rules. 
 But how it is being used is more like a dual WAN setup, with no Failover or Load Balancing, but where all internet traffic is routed out one WAN port, and only specific traffic is routed out the second WAN port. 
 Can anyone help clear up what is going on here, and what would be the preferred way of setting this up? Thanks,

 My question is, is, can you install hyper V in such a way that you don’t have the entire windows OS under it? That way all you’re running is hyper V on the bare metal with all of the VMs under it. (Dell Servers) 
 It’s just something I’ve never researched or known if it’s possible 
 To be honest, I’ve never installed the server OS without the GUI.
 I’m just really admitting my ignorance I’m just curious. To see if there’s a better way sometimes it seems like a waste to have the full OS just sitting there doing nothing when hyper V is doing 99% of the work on the post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning! 
 We recently installed a NUC11TNBV7 device in a room with a NEC monitor. To connect the device to the monitor we had to use a USB C to displayport cable. 
 The NUC displays an image when first turned on, but if the monitor is power cycled, the image stays black, and eventually the monitor will go back to sleep since it's not receiving an image. 
 I've updated the thunderbolt drivers, the bios, and the VGA drivers in the NUC but nothing seems to work. I've checked the power plan settings on the device as well as adjusting to maximum performance in the BIOS. 
 Interesting enough, unlike the other nucs in the room, when you vnc into the device with the monitor off it shows the full 1920x1080 and a monitor connected, while the older nucs revert to 800x600 and no monitor connected. 
 Due to the configuration of this room, using the HDMI out of the NUC is currently not an option. My next step will be to order an active HDMI to displayport cable. 
 Our NUC10's have no issue using USB-C to DP. I'm Curious if anyone else has any experience with USB-C display out issues with these NUC11 and if you have a solution.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our telecom team is moving off of our old on-prem VoIP and going to a cloud hosted solution. We tried to future proof ourselves years ago so we have ample campus bandwidth (small user count, 10G everywhere, DC and user traffic totally separated) so we never had a real reason to try and shoot ourselves in the foot with a bad QoS policy - but now with projects winding down we all collectively decided that now is a good time to take a look at it.
 I've been going through Cisco Live's breakout sessions and am starting to get a grasp, but the whole "cloud hosted VoIP" piece is throwing a wrench in my machine. Below are the guidelines that I'm trying to follow:
  
Marking DSCP as close to the source as possible - We're moving off of Cisco phones, so part of my testing is to use "auto qos voice trust" and see if the DSCP values stick with non-Cisco phones at the access port level, not just uplinks.
 QoS policies in hardware, not software
 Specifically call out VoIP as EF/AF46/COS5
  
Where I'm really lost is the cloud bit. As far as I know, ISPs don't give a toss about your DSCP markings and we aren't peering directly with this cloud service, so while the QoS that we haven't needed before would (well, might if we dont mess it up) work internally, all this work is going to be for nothing if we ship VoIP packets out into the wild internet and they get trampled.
 Is this just part of the known risk when going to a cloud service? I've asked for some technical documentation from them and we will have meeting where I can pepper them with questions, I'm just trying to get my ducks in a row and not be an IT dinosaur. 
 VoIP in the cloud, exciting times.
 Quick edit, I'm heavily leaning on this Cisco Live BRKCRS-2501 session and have a QoS book queued up in O'Reilly Books that I'll chew on over the next month

 One of our domain controller which is physical computer installed in a other site far away from my office, has no trust relation with our Active Directory, so it’s impossible for us to access it anymore. It happened after a “little” mistake was made. Basically this server is gonna be replaced and we need to clone it and redeploy it on a new VM in our hyperV cluster, for a specific software installed on it. So the clone was done, using disk2vhd cloning C: of that server, and mounted on a new VM, the new vm wasn’t connected with network until the IP was changed, but to change the name of that new VM, it was needed to downgrade the VM from DC to non DC, and to do this it had to be connected to the network, and it’s at that moment where we had the conflict, which made our physical machine loose the trust relationship and removed itself from our AD.
 Has anyone of you an idea on how to make the physical server re join our AD and being able to connect on it ? Beside going physically on site where the server is located which is a 6 hour drive from office. We can’t connect with any AD account because no trust relation, and no local account possible because it’s a domain controller.
 Sorry for my bad English, not my native language,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So hi,
 i am somewhat lost about how to proceed here.
 for as long as i can remember, i had no problem to propagate a specific website as startpage/homepage via policy, including those that are defined as "preferred" or "not locked", be it either per group policy for edge & chrome, or policies.json in Firefox.
 what exactly happens when a new policy, defined as "preferred" or "not locked" is applied, but a different setting already exists for a user?
 because all of sudden, i am getting a heap load of complaints, that for two different customers, and two different browsers (edge & firefox), the browser does not load the correct new startpage we have set per policy. for one customer, in edge it's set per GPO and for the other customer, in firefox it's set via policies.json.
 for firefox i was able to verify, one user has the old homepage set in his profile prefs.js. when i remove this, the policy applies as it should. the user didn't change anything homepage related on his end, he doesn't even touch firefox at all as he prefers edge. all users i talked to assert they have not set another homepage, and still there seem to be some user-specific changes to said setting. is there any way a differing setting could end up in the user-specific settings by other means?
 anyways, it appears the per-user-setting has priority. did this behaviour change recently? because i can't remember i've ever had this much trouble with policies like these before, and since 1-2 month ago, an alarming amount of people report this problem...

This was only discovered after finding that the logs had been filling up for over a year and auto-archiving, ending up generating over 840GB of logs over that time span. I can't find any reason for this system to be doing this.
 The other systems don't have ANY logs related to SeBackupPrivilege. Anyone have any ideas on what might be happening? So far my searches have turned up nothing useful.
 For reference, in a 24 hour period, the unaffected systems generate about 76,000 Security Log events - whereas the affected system is about double that, and the extra 76,000 are all related to SeBackupPrivilege.
 I will not be able to provide any actual logs due to the company policy, but still hope someone has some ideas on what it could be.

We've tested this on some of our machines running the latest build, 16227.20280. Checking for updates through any of the apps, it will start to download an apply an update. Once this has completed, M365 is downgraded to the build that was released on March 20th, 16130.20332.
 We're able to manually update back to the latest build by using the C2R updater and referencing the build number: "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\OfficeC2RClient.exe" /update user updatetoversion=16.0.16227.20280
 Going through the GUI update process will again downgrade it to 16130.20332.
 Checking our registries, we can see that in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration, the "VersionToReport" key references the latest build. My assumption is that this entry is used when checking for updates.
 So, maybe some funny business at Microsoft's end this morning? Anybody else experiencing this?

 I'm goin to have to clean a lot of vlans from around 10 Cisco Catalyst switches with IOS-XE, and I'm wondering what would be the best way to do so, a bit of introduction, some of em are in RSTP domain but not all, some of em aren't declared in vlan db anymore but still on the "allowed trunk" list in interfaces. 
 I'd like to automate it as much as possible, and i was looking at ntc-templates, the main process should be 
  
I decide i need to eliminate vlan 333
 Find, hopefully with some kind of automation, every port where the vlan is explicitly allowed but not the trunk all ports
 "no vlan 333"
 "no spanning-tree vlan 333"
 for every interface found at point 2, do "switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 333" still, with some kind of automation
 
 I'm no expert with ansible, ntc-templates and so on, but I like to get shits done in the most efficient wave, and I'm willing to invest a bit of time in this cause for sure it'll spare a ton of time for me and my team in the future, so, what are your suggestions to do this kind of thing in the most efficient way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opened a ticket with MS with severity B (although it might become A soon) and I'm now on day 3 of what I would image purgatory to be like. 
 These indians do not in any way understand the problem at hand, completely ignore my answers to their questions and the problem description presented to them.
 They just ask absolutely irrelevant, off topic questions that have nothing to do with the problem and seem to have no idea of the products they "support". 
 How do I escape this?
 How can I get actual help? 
 I always had a stereotype of thinking MS Support is bad but this is worse then my worst nightmares...

The router has Dhcp, NAT etc configured nothing major. However, what I tried recently was creating separate VRFs, one for the Customer and the second for the Management of the router. This was done to ensure to segregation of the routing tables of customer and management. 
 Now while deploying I was wondering, what are the pros and cons of creating VRFs in this scenario. What could be the possible downside of creating such a setup ? Appreciate your help and expertise, thanks in advance.

I am looking for a 10/25/100 Gbps capable switch and Mikrotik seems to do all of that and more for very little cost. I don't really need any bell or whistle since we only have a single server rack to make use of this switch. This will be for the backend communication between the servers and backup appliances. Simple config and some vlan. I mainly looking at this to speed up our backup and not to mention this switch cost less than our 1 Gps switch. 
 Do the networking community feel this switch is reliable enough for a small office?

 Occasionally, I'll set Teams to Do Not Disturb with the status stating why.
 People ignore this, not everyone, but they just straight ignore it like it isn't in their face. It's been brought up in meetings to respect other's time and status, but like most meetings at most places, it just ends up being talk and there is nothing formalized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all.
 Not really sure where else to post this. I did post this in r/networkautomation just now. 
 I've been going crazy the past few hours trying to fix this. I have a small EVE-NG environment running Cisco IOL and an Ubuntu box on my host machine. My goal is to start studying and writing Ansible playbooks for network automation.
 I CANNOT for the life of me SSH to my Cisco routers. At first it was giving me some Cipher key issues. Then a no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa error. I uncommented a bunch of lines and added some lines in my ~/.ssh/config file as well as my /etc/ssh/ssh_config and also an sshd file I believe (I don't fully recall as I did a bunch of stuff).
 Anyways, i'm at the point now when I try to SSH, I get an error in libcrypto error. I have removed my crypto keys and regenerated them. I had to generate them with a higher length as I was getting an invalid key length. All in all, I cannot SSH to these routers and I don't know why. I'm not the most Linux savvy but I will say I have no issues SSHing from my SecureCRT client on the same host machine. And telnet is a non-issue from my linux box either. It's solely SSH
 Any help would be appreciated because i'd like to move on with my studies and this all hinges on being able to SSH from this linux host box. 
 Thanks

I doubt it will be using close to 10Gig but if that's what they are paying for I don't want the router to be a bottleneck. Was originally looking at Cisco 4461 but even "performance license" aggregate throughput is only 3Gbps and "boost license" is 7 Gbps but only between built in 1Gbps interfaces. Would like to stay with Cisco but not a deal breaker as it's for a non-profit so don't want to break the bank. Also don't need anything fancy like SD-WAN but need 4 10Gbps interfaces.
 Does anyone have any experience with Cisco C8300-2N2S-4T2X? It has 2 10Gig ports and 2 NIM and 19Gigs of IPv4 forwarding throughput if not using SD-WAN.

Anyways, the company is paying for a ton of training and emersion days which, whatever the outcome at the end of this I am fully taking advantage of.
 My question are to those who have gone through similar migrations and really looking for, generally speaking, how your job transformed from on prem to cloud - and what you did to prepare for it. What are some things you wish you knew? What would you do differently? Not from a technical aspect, more from an education and toolset aspect. Are there things that would have made the transition smoother... Not going to to say "easy" bc I'm not naive.. lol.

 We have a Arris E6000 running docsis 3.1 and sip with a global DQoS for the service flow. For some unknown reason whenever a call is made, immediately after the phone is hung up and the gate is closed the internet speed it throttled down to exactly 33Mbps. This last for. Early 9 minutes on the dot. It happens every single time. If the phone is left off the hook and the call is disconnected from the far end, the throttling does not occur. As soon as the receiver is hung up, the throttling occurs. 
 This happens on multiple versions of of the E6000 firmware, it happens on any modem running SIP, it happens on any speed config, it happens with a standalone sip service flow config (note the call does not use the sip service flow and instead still uses the DQoS), it happens with different modem configs. 
 It’s a head scratcher for sure.

I've already hummed and hawed about how bounching it off of a third party isn't exactly the most secure and know that it's google, they will pretty much own a copy of anything we scan, but deaf ears.

 A little bit of background: I graduated in 2019 with a BS in computer science, no certifications yet, and landed my first job in IT a couple of months later in k12 education at a middle school. I was the sole IT person there, so I was in charge of everything that plugged into the wall, from desktop support, to sysadmin duties in the mdf room, to inventory/asset management. Being my first IT job, I learned so much there but after about 2 years it quickly got old and felt plateaued. Also the school district's IT department started making things more and more centralized so I started losing permissions and access. 
 Anyway, I started interviewing for mainly sysadmin jobs in late 2022…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ziply Fiber seems to be one of latest ISPs to begin selling a 10G service tier via their FTTH network. My understanding is that these guys are using XGS-PON for their access network, and if this is correct, how the heck are they able to claim to offer 10G? At best with no congestion from neighbors sharing the OLT port, an XGS-PON user should only be able to get about 8.5 Gbps in either direction due to FEC and other overhead. I can't find anything anywhere talking about Ziply starting to deploy any flavor of 25G PON or active Ethernet, so what gives? Is this just another example of a company's Marketing department having no idea what they're talking about? I'd love to hear from any Ziply engineers if you guys are lurking here, particularly about which PON platform you've deployed.
 EDIT: Mystery solved. Ziply is in fact doing active Ethernet for their 10G tier (this is the transceiver they use). Kudos to them! It's not super scalable but if they have the spare fiber strands to burn, it is the cheapest, easiest, and most performant option for getting 10G to residential customers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm working on a GPON/XGS-PON deployment. Normally, we use PLC splitters, but a manufacturer proposed an FBT splitter so we can daisy chain our taps (ie: 10% of light going to the tap splitter, with 90% of the light going to the next tap). These particular FBTs are described to work in the full 1250-1650nm range, which is unlike anything I've read, but great if it works.
 I'm worried about temperature. Everything I'm reading says FBT splitters work from -5 to 75 Celcius, where PLC's can go down to -40 Celcius operating range. The buildout is in New England, so temperatures can definitely get down to -20 celsius. Does anyone have experience with this? Should I expect insertion losses over the FBT (like an additional half db of loss) or should I expect the FBT splitter to fail completely?
 Thanks ahead of time for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To begin with, I'm not a networking expert, in any mean. I have noticed this weird behaviour of our router at work (we do web services and have many workstations connected in LAN):
  
We've got fiber optics connection through a modem/router installed by our ISP. We can't ask for another model, we can't use anything else (they refuse to setup anything else).
 Whenever the modem/router is hit by simultaneous connections (usually when more than 10 computers are connected), it crashes. If only one computer is connected and is hitting the modem with simultaneous connections (let's say multi-threaded download), the modem crashes.
  
The actual workaround is that if we use a VPN, which means only one connection is created from each computer, there's no crash. However, using an external VPN limits our bandwidth.
 Is there anything we can set on the network to limit the simultaneous connections? At the moment, we're out of ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked with replacing our security camera NVR. We've currently got a 16 channel Hikvision unit that (while being a major step up from our old java-based D-Link DVRs) is a pain in the butt with it's requirements for proprietary video plugins and management software that demands local admin rights.
 Fortunately, we have contractual obligations with some of our customers that prevent us purchasing any additional Hikvision equipment (NDAA concerns), so our need to upgrade to a 32 channel unit gives me the perfect excuse to ditch Hikvision and our current NVR.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for an NVR that works with modern web standards, can be fully managed without specialized software (or at the very least uses software that's not stuck with Windows 98 security practices) and has basic motion-triggered recording features?
 Also, we have a number of cameras we don't want to replace just yet, so ONVIF compatibility is a must-have (though I imagine that's fairly standard at this point).
 EDIT: I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised by all the software-based recommendations. On the one-hand, it makes sense that a pure software solution would offer the best features and widest camera compatibility. On the other, I'm really disappointed at the idea that there's so few decent turn-key appliances out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two t410, an all-in-one and a brick. They appear to be just barely capable enough to be obnoxious. I am working with a device that has a built-in webserver and I want to setup a terminal in my lab for anyone that wants to work with it; so, we don't have to tie up a computer for just a web browser. I can ping my server, but I cannot get this stupid zero client to actually access the device with firefox. the browser keeps defaulting to HTTPS and the device I am trying to access does not have an SSL certificate. I can access the about:config and I can modify ssl and secuirty settings, but they do not retain that state through a power cycle.
 I also cannot for the life of me, figure out how to install any of the add-ons I downloaded through Hp ThinUpdate; i have them on a USB and the USB is plugged into the zero client, but I can't get any further than that. 
 any thoughts? besides throw it away?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have multiple clients set up with Cerberus Professional for inbound SFTP file drops(multiple users/directories on each) on their Windows Server VMs, but as of a year or two ago Cerberus jacked the support/renewal price from $499 to $999 and as of 3 days ago all new pro license purchases are now locked in to that $999/year rate and if it expires the product stops working. Needless to say, we're not making out clients pay that and taking our business elsewhere.
 We liked Cerberus because it's super easy to set up and use, nice UI, and just plain works. Wanting something similar that doesn't cost a grand a year just so we can have SFTP. Not interested in any script, CLI, Linux, or open source solutions for various reasons. I've seen some mentions of CrushFTP around here, still a good option and comparable to Cerberus?

 There's a senior sys admin who sometimes give me things to do but NEVER explain properly why I should do this, what is the grand scheme of things etc
 When I ask him questions, his answers are extremely unclear and badly expressed while he is not even talking about very technical stuff...
 I was wondering if it's a common issue in IT and if you have tips to overcome situations like this. Thank you.

 Now we have VDI is coming along which means the computer name etc will be changing all the time for users. Only thing I can think is having some prompt before the user is aloud to open the app that updates the file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started with my company a few weeks ago, and apparently a week before I started management emailed to users that we would be removing .NET Core 2.1, 3.1, and 5 from everyone's machines on April 17. I just learned this last week when they put the task on me to figure out how to do it after Qualys reported these EOL .NET versions as vulnerabilities.
 I've looked into Microsoft's Uninstall Tool, but I'm seeing that versions that Visual Studio installed (such as .NET 3.1 SDK with Visual Studio Professional 2019) can ONLY be uninstalled through the Visual Installer to modify .NET. I've also tried looking into the WMIC command line and manually uninstalling in Programs & Apps, which both do not work for this.
 Am I at a loss or is there any actual way to remotely do what they are asking, such as with SCCM?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any Google Workspace admins in the crowd? 
 We shut off POP + IMAP access to email not too long ago, to stop that "backdoor" into downloading an entire corporate mailbox onto non-corporate devices. And things have been quiet; people have had to access their mailbox via gmail.com or a Gmail app since.
 Now we have a few (mouthy) users who want their desktop client back (Apple Mail for example). Security is reopening the review into how to make it work. But, I've been through this already and want to limit the rabbit hole we go down (for the 2nd time). 
 From what I can see, I can enable/disable IMAP on a group or OU basis in Google Admin. Further, I can limit the IMAP access to specific mail clients. But that is all. I can't, in any way, limit the IMAP to corporate-owned devices, or approved devices, anything like that. And Context Aware Access does not engage for IMAP in any way that I can see. I assume it's because you're not opening the specific Workspace apps themselves, you're just authenticating to establish the OAuth token.
 Am I missing something?

 In this day and age it feels like just about every CMDB solution is cloud based (for pretty good reasons imo) so finding one that is actually on prem is like finding a needle in a haystack.
 What CMDB solutions have you guys come across in your line of work that have been on-prem hosted?

 F&Q (https://wasabi.com/paygo-pricing-faq/#free-egress-policy) says, 
  
For example, if you store 100 TB with Wasabi and download (egress) 100 TB or less within a monthly billing cycle, then your storage use case is a good fit for our policy. If your monthly downloads exceed 100 TB, then your use case is not a good fit. 
  
Suppose storing 50GB on the Pay-Go plan. I understand I'll be charged for 1TB (a minimum monthly charge associated with 1 TB of active storage). How about the egress regulation? Will I have up to 1TB egress capacity? Or, just 50GB? 
 The same question goes for another situation: storing 1.2TB and being charged for 2TB. Will be the egress capacity 2TB or 1.2TB?

 After restarting Word, I did not see my AD RMS templates anymore, which is great because this is what I expected. But instead, it connected to Azure RMS and showed the "Restricted Access" and "Unrestricted Access" template, as well as previously configured Sensitivity Labels. I did not create a SRV record for redirection, therefore I'm also wondering why it did connect to Azure RMS.
 I reverted the permission change on the license.asmx file and included my user again to read the file. I can verify this by opening the URL in the browser. I also deleted the MSIP folder in %localdappdata% and removed everything from the registry, that points to <GUID.aadrm.com>. Office is still connecting everytime to Azure RMS instead of my internal AD RMS server. I have an existing SCP, but this seems to be ignored now and I cannot get it back working to use AD RMS.
 Any advise?

We currently have around 50 vessels that are essentially floating mini offices and each having their own network on board. We are using Peplink routers as it can use cellular network to provide internet whilst out at sea (hopefully moving to Starlink for future endeavours, but thats another story lets just say awaiting on management). 
 I just wanted to know if there is anything out there that can monitor the network for each vessel remotely in one place. I would like it mainly to monitor bandwidth usage and traffic, similar to DPI. Unfortunately, only the higher end models of Peplinks have a DPI feature which we do not use.
 Any recommendations would greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope this is the right place to post. I have a homelab I want to implement some branding on the search highlights / search menu, which can be done using Azure AD (https://techb4.com/search-highlights-logo-customize-for-windows-10-11/).
 I wonder, since it is just the 'Search' app likely looking for files in a directory, or registry keys, can this be set by just putting the right files in the right place? I don't have an Azure AD machine to test this on or find the correct locations, however. It would be nice to create a GPO with these files so all my VMs can have consistent branding.
 Not sure how time consuming it would be to just create a new fresh vm, join it to a new free azure instance to test it myself. Like take a reg/files snapshot and then join, get the branding and take another reg/files snapshot and diff them.
 Since MS removed my option for branding (the 'System' control panel area) in the latest version of Windows I have to look for other areas!
 Anyone got any ideas, or is it just not possible without AAD?

 The latest march security update (Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016) is causing an issue with my IIS.
 As soon as I install it a new DLL gets added "sprequestfilteringmodule.dll" and the IIS becomes unreachable (503 error). What's interesting upon further investigation is that the WSUS Application Pool can't be started (no error message is shown, it just immediatly stopps again). The WAS Service is up and running though. In the Event Viewer, there are errors from the WAS Service with the Event ID 5002. A restart didn't help, the server had to be restored in order to get the IIS fast online again. More info to the server: It's a Windows 2012 R2 Server running SharePoint 2013 and the IIS. Has anyone encountered a similiar problem with the March Update or maybe even found a solution? Thanks already for reading and have a nice day

 I'm looking for some ideas on what to look for in regard to the below issue.
 The setup is 2 Nexus Switches with 4 vPC links going to 4 Isilon Appliances. (2 links per Appliance) Each interface on the Isilons have an IP address assigned and then the whole lot are in a cluster with Virtual IP.
 When all links are up I get packet loss to the Virtual IP. But if I shut down 1 redundant link per Isilon Appliance the packet loss goes away. 
 Has anyone seen this behaviour before? 
 MTU is set the same on both sides.

 Just wondered how many of you are using LDAP without SSL? and has anyone purchased third party certificates for SSL? That might be something I can look into.

 They're still in the startup phase so there are no solutions like SCCM yet. Already told management about this and they'll be looking into getting someone and the usual blah blah blah.
 For now, I have to do everything manually and i'm looking to speed up the process. Not sure if you have to enable the 'Receive updates from different Microsoft products' but if you scroll down a little you can find some optional updates. They're mostly device drivers.
 I was wondering if anyone uses this and if it's any good.
 Right now I do Windows updates and then either a Dell Command update or Lenovo Service Bridge update, but if it's possible to merge the process it saves me a good amount of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning
 I have been given the green light to implement cloud based printing in our business of around 300 users and 40 printers. I'm looking to go with Printer Logic as the print queue based licensing suits our needs better. 
 I'm just curious to know from anyone that has rolled this out what your procedure was? Currently have 2 print servers, one for each site. I want to do some initial testing first with a couple of printers before rolling out across the business. 
 We have around 10 GPOs relating to mapping printers for users (the guy before created a GPO for every different department instead of just using 1 GPO with item level targetting) Is it a matter of amending these GPOs to delete rather than create/update before pushing out the Printer Logic agent to the endpoints?
 Appreciate any advice
 Thank you

 It is widely reported on the internet and there are some workarrounds (replacing the MSTSCAX.DLL file or adding a reg key for the udp problem)
 In january there was a update that should have fixed this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/january-26-2023-kb5022360-os-build-22621-1194-preview-f6973dbe-bcc4-402a-8b9a-0541b0959403
 Unfortunatly this problem keeps coming back every month or so and im getting frustrated with the ammount of time me and my team have put in these work arrounds.
 The update is installed on all our customers computers but the problem came back today after a new update. 
 ​
 Does anyone here have a better way to deal with this problem than to manualy rename the MSTSCAX.DLL files and replacing them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Fellas :)
 I hope this is the correct flair, I was unsure if I should choose "Question" or "Microsoft"?
 I am currently having a problem with Microsoft Teams at one of our customers. It is a medium-sized company with about 30 employees.
 All employees work on a Windows Server 2019 terminal server and have a Microsoft 365 Business Basic license. Teams has the latest updates.
 At the beginning of the Corona Pandemic, the Teams-Free licenses were rolled out as a test. Everything has now been migrated to Microsoft 365 and the users have full licenses that also include the use of teams.
 Now the problem, which affects a part of the users, about a third: Teams ALWAYS logs in with the old "Free" account and does not recognize the assigned license. Logging out and back in manually doesn't help either. In the free account, an old database is listed up to the end of 2020, everything after that (since using the O365 licenses) seems to be in a kind of different profile that is not loaded.
 I have already reinstalled Teams, assigned / withdrawn the Teams Exploratory license from all users as a test and deleted the Teams cache under %appdata%/Microsoft/Teams.
 If the user logs into Teams via office.com, everything works as it should and the correct content and chats are displayed, the problem ONLY affects the local client.
 Do you have any idea? Some Teams-related things are just out of my understandings... Thanks!

I've also seen in their network infrastructure diagrams that they are also (but not only) running several 2650 and 2810 switches. It's not the focus of their request, but it got my attention.
 I've quickly checked their end of sale (both: 10y+) and the last time HPE/Aruba ever released software updates for the se switches (> 5y for one of them). These switches have Lifetime warranty and the clients' sysadmins is aware of that. In my experience HPE was also pretty OK with replacing defective units without much fuss. Yet without knowing the exact year they got purchased these 2 indicators would tell me that these switches are likely to have high runtime and should (really) be considered for replacement.
 While I've worked with HPE/Aruba switches it's not my daily business anymore (more in the system engineering field these days) thus I'm asking for an opinion.

 Usually I would not expose a database on the internet. I don't like that. It feels wrong to me.
 Am I too picky?
 What is the todays standard, to allow access to such a database?
 I have grafana running on the cluster. I could add a datasource and then the dude can build his panels and see the data. With 2fa, roles and permissions... but no Idea if I am thinking to complex.

 I am tasked with installing wifi in two buildings that are connected to the MDF via singlemode 9/125um fiber. The wifi will be broadcasting a public and private SSID on separate VLANs.
 Will any generic 9/125um SM LC SFP modules work with the indicated switch models, or are there compatibility issues among suppliers? Also do you foresee any VLAN tagging issues with this layout? I know I can do all this with fiber media converters and non-SFP switches, but I wanted to kill two birds with one stone, and cut out the converters and extra points of failure. Total length of both buildings together is approx 700ft.
 Note: there may be a MDF-IDF2 fiber run, but I won't know for sure until I talk to the cabler. The MDF fiber panels aren't labeled, so I didn't include the 2nd MDF fiber panel in the diagram. But if the MDF-IDF2 fiber run does exist, the design won't change much. Instead the 2nd SFP module will move to the MDF switch.

 What do you think the best practice is? 
 The purpose is to monitor the device and BGP session (downlink, device down, etc.) using Cisco Prime. 
 I can ping the router's public IP from the inside, but pinging from the public router to internal networks is a no-go.

 - SonicWall TZ370 NGFW
 - REOLINK NVR

 Current set-up is Modem > Router (handles DHCP & is default gateway) > NVR, Computers. I want to keep the router in here for Wi-Fi capability.
 Here is a picture of how I want to set this up: https://imgur.com/a/cRCLA8p "Modem > NGFW (X1 WAN port), NGFW (X3 port) > Router (Internet Port), Router (Ethernet Ports) > NVR, Computers" but when I seemingly plug it in, the end devices don't have internet.
 I'm wondering if I have to flush the IP addresses of all devices and set the default gateway to the NGFW? If so, how do I do that? If its easier, could I still let the router handle DHCP and give the NGFW an IP?
 Also the default IP for the X0 LAN port on the NGFW is 192.168.168.168. The IP range from the router is the usual 192.168.1.1-.254. In order to access the NGFW, do I have to set the X0 LAN port to something inside the router's range?
 Thanks for any and all help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got another fun one!
 So imagine you have an on prem AD, contoso.local, that doesn't really do much outside of PC login auth but you're quite attached to it. Then imagine you also have M365 in parallel, as contoso.com and it is in use for keeping track of M365 licenses, which is no biggie, but also for auth for some third party services, which becomes a massive PITA if it breaks. 
 Now picture a world where you want the two to work together. Now, if someone who gets paid a lot more than me hadn't gone in and just manually created accounts for everyone in 365 and had instead used aad connect it'd be pretty simple and my life would be easier. But that was not to be. I can't just do the needful, make a new upn suffix and have sync magically just work. 
 Can I map existing on prem AD users to 365 users with aadsync? And the PCs too, I guess, although while they[re there they're not really there, y'know? Ultimately, we're wanting to keep a couple AD servers on prem because it is just so dang easy to use (especially as an auth provider for a lot of internal stuff) but because everyone else is using cloud then we are too. Has anyone easily married the two without too much disruption (or work, because who wants to do more than they absolutely need to?)

I've explained to the CFO that we have other consultants working for us who either have their own issued computers, or, are using cloud services to upload their work so that internal employees can review and save it as needed. His only argument for allowing a computer we do not manage to connect directly to our internal network is that it would be faster and more efficient for this consultant to do his work. My rebuttal is that while it is faster for him to do all of his work on a single computer it raises our risk by an incalculable amount that I do not think is worth considering.
 While I feel fairly secure in my response, and I have not relented one bit, his over the top response to this has me wondering what other professionals in the field feel about this situation.
 Thoughts? Am I the a-hole?

However, since this traffic forwards through the br25 bridge, the traffic source is from 192.168.25.250. That's fine for srv01 -> gwith02. However, traffic initiated from gwith02 -> srv01 won't get there (by name). I have to do this numerically, through the br25 bridge. 
 I don't think this is a routing issue. Is there something I can do to the bridge to change this?

We only deal with the US company. Im a System Analyst and System Admin at my current role! This past month marks my 1yr and just had my review and was told i would get a raise as my performance was great. Fast forward to this month i was informed the company is cutting cost spent to much money in start up phase! And i would need to hold off. This is 2nd time to hold off. Said raise was supposed to have came at 6mths then again at a yr. No raise.
 Boss Today asked how we can save money and cut cost for company and IT dept. 
 So i turned in my notice. And saved the company 70,000 plus the lack of a raise they no longer have to lie about. .

 When i try to use 802.1x on a managed aruba switch thats connected to the access layer none of the port access requests make it to the clearpass server, i know radius is working because i can login to the switch with my radius credentials and my changes are showing up in clearpass.
 The port that the downstream switch is connected to does not have port access enabled, its just a regular port with all VLANs tagged as i would configure any normal trunk between 2 switches.
 Am i missing something here? can 802.1x wired authentication work across multiple switches?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, I've gone through various laptop docking station setups and it's been a frustrating experience. My Dell E6410 worked reliably with a proprietary dock, but my Dell XPS 13 with a Thunderbolt dock had endless issues with detection. Even after multiple driver downloads and fresh Windows installs, problems persisted with sound and monitor detection.
 I then switched to an HP EliteBook X360 with a USB C dock, which worked well until I hit limitations with monitor resolution. I replaced that with a Startech Thunderbolt 3 dock, which generally worked fine but occasionally required unplugging and replugging after sleep mode.
 Now, with my Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 5, I use a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock for Workstations. While I can remove my laptop from the dock without issue, returning it to the dock requires a hard reboot. And when the laptop goes to sleep, waking it up is often hit or miss, with only one screen coming up or no keyboard function.
 It's frustrating to deal with these issues, and I know I'm not alone - I constantly hear from my users with similar problems on their devices, including Microsoft Surface Laptops with both Surface Docks and universal docks. It's been over half a decade since USB C docks became the standard and there seems to be little improvement from manufacturers. Are the engineers at the manufacturers as frustrated as we are?
 All of my experiences have been with Win10 or 11, perhaps Microsoft is to blame.

 How are you handling these issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I'm new here.
 Our story begins with a switch stack, we'll call it switch 3. Switch 3 has been communicating with another switch called switch 50.
 Switch 3 and Switch 50 are using APs to talk to each other.
 switch 3 is configured as follows:
 interface TenGigabitEthernet2/0/47
 switchport trunk native vlan 10
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,100
 switchport mode trunk
 end
 and switch 50 is configured as follows:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport trunk native vlan 10
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,100
 switchport mode trunk
 ip dhcp snooping trust
 end
 interface Vlan1
 ip address 172.X.X.Z *netmask*
 !
 interface Vlan10
 ip address 10.X.X.Y *netmask*
 the meat of the story is that things in the IP subnet of VLAN 10 can communicate back and forth between the network. an example would be switch 3 pinging an IP in the VLAN 10 range (10.X.X.Y) that lives on switch 50. But when I try to ping an IP in the VLAN 1 range (Yes, I know, I inherited this network) there is no response. I will provide an example below:
 SW-003#ping 10.X.X.Y
 Type escape sequence to abort.
 Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.X.X.Y, timeout is 2 seconds:
 .!!!!
 Success rate is 80 percent (4/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 2/21/43 ms
 but when I ping switch 50 using the VLAN 1 range it shows below
 SW-003#ping 172.X.X.Z
 Type escape sequence to abort.
 Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.X.X.Z, timeout is 2 seconds:
 .....
 Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)
 I know this is a whole bunch of Cisco, but I'm unsure if this is a Ruckus AP\WiFi issue or if I am missing a crucial bit of configuration on the Cisco side.
 ​
 I am re-posting this in other subreddits for visibility and insight.

 I have a Synology 802.11ac router with roughly 60 devices connected. Guest network is turned on.
 About a month ago, devices in the main network started to not have internet connection unless I assigned a static IP. I don't understand why but this has just been the case. Almost every device in the warehouse is now on a static IP. The guest network however is able to assign an IP naturally and the devices work without static IPs with no issue.
 That all being said, I have an alarm.com svr and cameras that I had to connect to the guest network to get them functioning at all which is not what I want. The svr is plugged in via ethernet (it has to be) which tries to connect it to the main network. I cannot assign an IP to the svr in the app which leaves me with a dead camera system since it cant connect to the internet.
 I'm kind of just stuck and would like to figure out how I can get the main network DHCP server to assign good IPs again and get my camera system working.
 Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me solve this!!!

 I know that the wol itself is a broadcast packet and the goal is if someone is VPN ing from outside then they should be able to login to the PCs even if they are turned off.
 I found this online is this something that can be done or am I looking at the wrong thing here? It's from 2011.
 https://www.ciscozine.com/wake-on-lan-through-internet/
 They are using a router here but instead of the router can this be done on the access switch(the static arp entry)?
 Otherwise this is the traffic flow for VPN traffic from outside
 Outside (from users PC from home or wherever) - outside ASR router - Palo firewall - nexus 7k - access switch - then the desktops

 ​
 We use Cacti to monitor most stuff on our network but I am not sure how to monitor BGP route changes. Like how do I know if the internet switched from primary to secondary isp.
 We use uptime robot to monitor network from outside because it pings the ISP IPs. But is there is a better way than to just ping the interface? When I google all I see is products that sells monitoring. If you can point me to any resources that would be great!

On the same subnet I have other servers that are not slow. All computers in the domain, static IP or Dynamic, regardless of vlan, have issues connecting to server A. If I check the switches and router, we're running at about 5% utilization. Internet speeds are at gig. Someone from the company came out and said, "the issue is on your dhcp network". So I'm thinking, that doesn't make sense, it's the same network. If he couldn't pick up an IP I'd see that as a problem with DHCP for sure, but once he's got one, not sure it matters. He insist when he sets his laptop to a static IP, it works fine, but when on DHCP, no luck. His static settings match what our DHCP hands out (subnet mask, dns, gateway, etc.) Any thoughts on why only this computer, not on our domain, would connect when on static and not DHCP.

 I've been trying to setup Oxidized as a replacement for our old RANCID configuration and was wondering how this would work with Aruba switches and PFSense firewalls.
 I know oxidized works with the older HP Procurves but I can't find any examples of it working with Aruba. I know that there is a model: procurve tag for oxidized but would that be the same for Aruba?
 Also, if anyone has gotten this to work with PFSense and would be willing to share their config and router.db file, I would appreciate it greatly.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I was admitted, 2 years ago, coworkers complained about the state of the archive room and how it would be cool if someone, somehow, put everything online, making it easy for all of us to access stuff in it.
 There's no way one can just put the archive online while continuing to create files on paper. So I told the President we needed software that provided all the functions for the relevant departments, and managed to find an open-source and well supported software for that.
 I presented it to the relevant sectors of the company and they basically didn't like it, saying it would be "too difficult" to adjust to using it. I tried again, and they said the application sucks without even so much as touching it. Talked to the President and he insisted we must use it. Scheduled training this morning, no one showed up.
 I'm not sure what these people want to be honest. No way I'm going to be responsible for operating the software too, it's not even my function, I just provided them the software. They dead-on said they didn't like it and want to go back to the way it was before, i.e. doing everything on paper. I even mentioned a search in the archive can be done in less than a minute now thanks to the software and they couldn't be pissed.
 How do you guys manage to convince coworkers? Or should I just say fuck it and let them have it their way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone confirm how thousandeyes pricing model works? Cisco seems to be clueless. 
 Say if we have 100 branch offices or remote sites. At each branch office, we have a core router/firewall, core switch, lots of poe switches, and access points. My understanding is we would need 1 enterprise agent at each site to monitor these network devices at the site via SNMP. Do they charge per each Enterprise Agent, or per each network device (router, switch, ap) monitored? They call these network devices Device-Layer Devices https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/device-layer/discovering-device-layer-devices
 We would then have probably one employee at each site that would have the endpoint agent installed on their laptop. We would like to run bandwidth speed test, confirm dns and basic internet connectivity is working to all cloud applications hosted on the internet. I would hope it would take into account the wifi connectivity from the laptop to the ap, the connectivity from the ap to switch, switch to router, router to ISP, and ISP to cloud application? How is this priced?
 Are we looking at 100 enterprise agents and 100 endpoint agents? 
 Can Thousandeyes replace a traditional NMS for SNMP polling and up/down ICMP pinging? Does it provide netflow, syslog ingestion, and BGP monitoring?

We bought the StarTech.com Serial DB9 RS232 Extender extender (part RS232EXTC1), which has female serial connections on both adapters. We used the gender changer adapter that came with it in order to connect the blue Cisco serial console cable to the powered adapter.
 We're not able to connect to the switch via serial, even with both adapters powered. I'm wondering if anyone has done this before, and if serial extenders are compatible with Cisco switches.
 Perhaps the powered adapters aren't necessary, perhaps the gender changer is a null modem, or perhaps the switch isn't compatible with serial extenders. I'm hoping that someone smarter than us knows a simpler way to do this (it must remain serial and cannot be network/IP-based management). Our Internet searches are not coming up with much.

 Which is not valid. It should be

 I did not see with certainty in the switch config that it's OS6, but I do see on https://www.netsolutionworks.com/Networking-Switches/N2000-Series/N2048P.asp
 It says that all N Series switches include Dell NOS6.. For giggles I tried other Dell OS modules but none had better result. Any thoughts?

 Everything else on the wifi seems to work but Whatsapp doesn’t connect. Its not really a big problem as i think im the only one using it once a week. But im sure someone will complain eventually. 
 Any ideas my current thought is maybe whatsapp has an IPV6 requirement now but not sure.

 Mainly, I want to create a keypair for a single developer. Any server he/she needs access to, I can add their account and public key file to the server. No creds to share or store. Easy to do for one server, but what if I am setting up multiple servers for this developer? I'm dreading the thought of having keypairs per account per server.

 We use Edge as the default browser across our org of <1000 machines and have a number of Policies set in Group Policy to standardize the experience. Nothing too crazy, just some default favorites, setting the new tab page, and a few others.
 The issue is that we've found a large and seemingly random amount of computers aren't applying ALL the policies. Most will apply. If you check the registry, every policy key is there. But Edge doesn't show them under Edge://Policy
 It doesn't matter the version of Edge, updating makes no difference. OS version makes no difference. The ADMX templates are updated as of yesterday. The machines affected are seemingly random.
 The policies were set in our Default Domain Policy (I didn't love using that), so I copied every setting and placed in a new GPO and applied to just the computers OU. Confirmed with GPOresult -r they are receiving it (and the registry keys are there under HKLM/Software/Policies/Microsoft/Edge) No change. 
 What is so weird is MOST of the policies show up in Edge, with only a few totally missing. But even some that are listed in Edge, are not actually working. Like the Home Page URL. How could that just not work?
 Has anyone encountered this before? It is making me feel crazy.

 Are there alternative methods to protect the private keys on an always running Windows Enterprise CA such as just locking down access to it in a certain way that allows it to function issuing certificates for autoenrollment to users and devices, but still keeping the private key protected from compromise.

 That being said we use Microsoft Authenticator for our users as a general MFA tool. I was hoping there was a way to send a push notification through Azure, but I can't find anything.

 I just started using some opengear hardware. We have a lighthouse server behind a firewall, that cannot be reached by our opengear console switches when they are using their fallback cellular connection. My setup is using the "Auto-Response" that checks if the Ethernet connection can reach the lighthouse server. If that fails it turns on the cellular connection and the OpenVPN connection towards our OpenVPN server and here comes my issue. The OpenVPN connection establishes for a second before going down and then it just loops going up and down etc. I can see the following in "/var/log/messages"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 ​
 I'm not sure if I'm in the right sub, if not, sorry :)
 ​
 I work at a MSP which offers IaaS and SaaS services.
 Currently we are on a pure Juniper infrastructure in terms of firewall and switches. 
 However, after certain devices go EOL and the maintenance renewal is pending for others, we are asking ourselves whether Juniper is still the right choice, since the maintenance fees alone are very high.
 ​
 To give a bit of an idea of what size range we are in:
 2 hardware firewalls:
 - Mainly L4 Statefull firewall for 12 security zones with a total of about 100 VLANs as gateway.
 - 10 Site2Site VPNs
 ​
 6 switches with the following connections (not counting uplinks)
 56 x 10 GBe
 44 x 1GBe
 20x 40GBe
 6 x 100GBe
 ​
 So not a lot, but a bit of something, which is probably what we are counting with most manufacturers in the campus segment.
 ​
 We are currently considering FortiGate for the firewall and Mellanox for the switches. At the same time, I came across FortiSwitches, which I have no experience with. Does anyone have a comparable setup and recommendations regarding function and economy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I work at a place where all our internal tools are installed in an old (but not so bad) way. The typical infra for an app is two servers with redundancy (keepalived, HeartBeat...).
 This means one tool = at least 2 servers + some networking and one small team for maintenance (often 1-3 people). 
 For the context, we don't do cloud providers (sensitive data) and we don't have to handle a lot of traffic load (internal tools only).
 When I arrived I suggested to "centralize" this as more and more apps were also shipped containerized. So with my team we set up a Kubernetes infra which work very well, and with few servers we are able to host like 10 internal tools.
 My points are : this brings same maintenance for all the apps (common k8s dashboard, procedures...), same backups and disaster recovery system, better security management etc. (I won't teach you all of this I think ^^) 
 But the thing is : before all of this, there was very few service interruptions, and when it happened it had impact on one tools only. The k8s infra is simpler and more powerful, we had no interruption in one year. Last week, we had a stupid issue with a certificate in the CNI that interrupted all the cluster for one day (the k8s expert were not on site this day). 
 This event created a bit of a debate about migrating legacy apps to k8s, am I still on the right path ? How to reassure the old sysadmins ? I'm still thinking that k8s simplifies a lot our work

Switches send dot1x to Clearpass RADIUS which in turn returns a secure vlan tag for the switch. No certificate means the device either get some other know device category or rejected into a guest vlan. Easy.
 Same goes for wireless: workstation sends it's certificate towards SSID secure-ad-xyz, which authenticates towards Clearpass as RADIUS. Clearpass only sets access allowed/denied.
 So a seperate SSID per purpose. My question: can Aerohive APs/SSID's broadcast dynamic vlans on 1 SSID...? Depending the presented certificate a certain vlan tag? 
 Defining a RADIUS server is easy enough and obvious to find. But I cannot seem to find any documentation on AAA or dot1x portcontrol or how to setup dynamic/<any NAC>/Clearpass-returned tunnel-private-group-id ..?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello-
 I am setting up my first ERSPAN configs on my nexus 9k switches. I need 2 separate monitors each sent via a different I address. I followed along with a guide and came up with the following for the first:
 NX-01(config)# monitor session 10 type erspan-source
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# erspan-id 20
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# vrf default
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# destination ip 2.2.2.2
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# source interface ethernet e1/2 both
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# no shut
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# exit
 NX-01(config)# monitor erspan origin ip-address 1.1.1.1 global
 Then on the second I have a different destination ip and different source interface obviously, but I want that monitor to out via 1.1.2.1 and I am guessing the "global" command i used above makes all ERSPAN go out the 1.1.1.1 address? How would I change it so that "erpsan-id 20" goes out 1.1.1.1 and "erspan-id 30" goes out 1.1.2.1?
 Thanks!

The application requires the roles “Reports Reader” and “Cloud application administrator”. Currently trying to investigate if it is possible to restrict the scope of permissions for these roles for the application. The other companies are worried about the “Reports Reader” role since this role can access sensitive data from the other companies as well. 
 Is there anyway to install this enterprise application in the tenant without giving the app permission to read the other companies “sign-in data” and other sensitive information?

 We need to unblock the microsoft store for these apps to install successfully, but we don't want our users installing any app they like via the store themselves, how can we limit this?
 We could potentially hide the shortcut, but that would be updated with every update so would be a never ending fight,
 I've read this: Manage access to private store (Windows 10) | Microsoft Learn but it looks like this applies the windows store for business, can anyone confirm?
 Would love to hear how people are managing this if at all,

 Just a bit of background - we used to be fully on prem AD company, but now we're rolling out Intune. We've already had setup AD Connect so all AD accounts are synced with AAD. In this moment each member of my IT team have a:
  
Domain admin account which we use only on our servers and don't touch endpoints with them.
 
Global Azure account for Azure/365 admin stuff.
 
Standard user account we use for day to day, without any domain/azure admin access, just with local admin on our own machines.
 
 Now that we're rolling out Intune, I've setup an Azure LAPS solution (lean LAPS) on each Intune Windows device endpoint, to have a local admin as a fall back, but that's not real…]]></summary>

 But this feauture is keeping me really busy these days.
 People lost their signatures. wel they are not lost but they are under the catagory "signatures on this computer" and can't be applied automatically to the newly writen or reply mails. 
 So that sucks, cause a lot of people have more than 1 account signed in their outlook using the same signature.
 When i uncheck the box for cloud save, it still synced signatures from other personel that are using the same mail adresses. 
 Is it just me or is this feauture not thought through properly? 
 Why not make the local signatues also available for being assigned automatically? 
 Does anyone has a faster solution other then copying the signatures again to every mail adres the customer uses?
 Like how to disable this entirely before a sync even happens?

 Some of our customers want to test our software before installing it in their productive environment, since it's rather complicated to install and needs a server.
 We'd like to provide virtual machines to our customers with our software on there for them to test.
 Does anyone have experience setting up something like this?
 My current plan is to get a somewhat decent PC to act as a Server for virtualization since server hardware is super pricey.
 Then I'd either get a Windows Server License and create Virtual Machines for each customer using HyperV
 OR
 I would install Proxmox and buy multiple Win10 Pro licenses to create a virtual machine for every customer. 
 Are there better ways for that? Is it even allowed to provide our customer with a fully installed Windows 10 Pro with our software on it?
 Cloud (AWS, Azure etc.) is unfortunately not an option.
 I feel like there are better ways for doing what I have planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Looking to get some input from the hive mind...
 MSA 1050 with SAS connection to 2 Hyper-V nodes. Inherited the current configuration with 6 1.8TB SAS disks in RAID 6. this should theoretically give me around 7.2TB of useable storage.
 Additional array of 4 x 2.4TB disks installed in RAID 5 again theoretical useable of 7.2 TB.
 All that's working as expected the disk groups state size as 7192 GB in both instances, however, in windows after mapping the volumes they're showing as 6.54 TB in both instances.
 The first array (RAID 6 1.8TB disks) is nearly full hence installing new array to archive some data off, however, looking at the SAN management interface there's apparently a TB of unallocated storage. Pool B has nothing moved onto it yet so I assume that's why it's reporting as virtually empty.
 I've read through the supporting documentation and followed to the letter with creating the disk group and volume. I haven't been able to find anyone else with this problem, which makes me think it's just the way it is, but seems odd.
 Has anyone come across this before? I'm not overly familiar with HP SANs or SAS connections to them.
 Thanks in advance!

 Currently it looks like that they won't be able to find a suitable replacement before I leave and I assume that I won't meet my successor to show and explain our IT landscape personally.
 There is a lot of documentation available, but it's quite verbose and I can imagine that it is hard for someone new to find specific information without a lot of reading. I would therefore like to provide an extra set of documents to my successor that contains the most important things to help get him/her started quickly and smoothly.
 Given you would be my successor, what information would help you most to find your way around as the new system administrator? What would be the most important things to have at hand when there is nobody around to ask?

Currently my MSP supports small business and 99% of our clients run horrible EOL devices that have countless security issues and lists of other issues. Sadly my MSP is undergoing changes from a buyout and other issues, so our focus is currently on just band aid fixing 99% of these platforms and not properly upgrading or find long term solutions. This is only the start of the list of things wrong with my MSP, I've come to the conclusion I'll officially be moving on. I used to work for the CA government and while it was not perfect by had a lot of advantages compared to my current position.
 I wanted to get feedback from everyone on the best types of companies to work for. I understand there are great fortune 500 companies like Netflix, Linkedin etc. However I wanted to see if anyone had from personal experience a field that generally has a good IT backbone. For example I've been looking into banks or hospitals since both will more then likely have a huge security presence and more then likely a proper set of policies and procedures.

 I have been trying to get iDRAC up and running recently, but it has been driving me crazy and would love a little help if any one could!
 ​
 A bit of background:
 I have have an old Dell PowerEdge C2100 I have had for a little over two years. I have never updated the BIOS or iDRAC firmware since I have had it, as I thought that they were probably close to latest possible version being as old as it is. I now have run into an issue with iDRAC as it has become so old no web browser (even internet explorer) wants to interact with it with the exception of my IOS devices (I assume safari is very leanient on older TLS protocols when accepting the risk of an invalid cert). After some research I found a reddit post (I can't find it but if I do i'll link it here) about how they bricked theirs by not first updating to 1.65.66 and now iDRAC doesn't work anymore. I then stumble across another couple posts mentioning that there are at least 4-5 stepped firmware upgrades you must do in order but no one mentions them. I have searched through Dell's site for a couple days now and can only find BIOS firmware and some client exes on the official Dell PowerEdge C2100 downloads page.
 ​
 I guess my questions are, where can I find resources on what major versions I must update to and where can I find the update files for iDRAC? I have heard of a bootable Update ISO that helps get the required updates from the Dell Repository, is that supported for C2100s (I can't find any trace of it).
 ​
 I really appreciate any help, thanks guys!

 There are 8 users. It's only used as a file share. The files are office files but also lots of blue prints (PDF) which can sometimes be as large as 10MB.
 I'd like to go RAID5.
 Would there be a significant benefit on going with the Synology SSDs over the Seagate IronWolf HDDs?
 We don't need much storage. 2TB would be ok. But the difference between buying 3 HDD or 3 SSD is around $700. 
 Files are accessed over the network, on a 1 Gbps speed.
 Thanks for any advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am using DMVPN solution on Cisco IOS XE devices.
 The IPSec tunnels created are protected using CA certificates.
 Now I noticed that the IPSec tunnels will stay up even if I deleted the certificate , and the tunnels will not go down except if I disabled and enabled it again (Probably because the IKE is reinitiated).
 Is there anyway to force IPSec for routine Certificate checking , so that in case the CA certificates at the client is revoked, deleted or expired for some reason , the IPSec tunnel will go down ?.
 Let me know what do you think.
 Thanks in advance.

 So last week we changed the domain we were using as a vpn endpoint… was a red tape thing after being acquired… We were told to add “vpn.domain.com” to our existing domain… Anyways the change went well… or so we thought.
 About 12 hours after the change about 90% of people could connect… Of the 10% that couldn’t we realized they ALL had Spectrum at home. No one had issues with Comcast or ATT.
 Now, we have two guys on a business trip to do some maintenance on our servers at an out of state colo. They too are also unable to connect and are receiving the same error message “Cant connect to the specified secure gateway.”
 My manager says its because we don’t have ‘DMARC’ set up for this new domain… Everything I’ve read on DMARC seems highly specific to email so I’m very confused how this would be relevant…
 Without going down a rabbit hole – does anything jump out here that I should check? Not trying to waste anyones time… just curious if this is something obvious that I’m oblivious to.

Thankfully the message and its Trojan PDF was blocked by MS Defender as Trojan_PDF_QakAdobeLureZip_A.
 I have seen a few of these, including one thread that was stolen from a major corporation that had nothing to do with us (probably a mistake in the phishing scripts).
 Is the consensus that these were mined from phishing victims who gave out their email credentials and then the bad actors put a forwarding rule to capture the emails?
 How might you go about informing the original sender whose email I believe was hacked? I feel a sort of duty to do so, but these emails were from seven months ago. Any evidence might be long gone.

I'm going to preface this post by saying I have never had hands-on experience with an Enterprise MPLS network or the process of ordering such a service. That being the case, there is a ton of information out there about MPLS and how it works, how you configure it within devices, etc. But one thing I can't seem to find is any information about the underlying Layer-1 transport for MPLS. I'm aware that MPLS doesn't really care if it travels across UTP cables or Optical links but what I'm wondering is this; For those of you who have actually installed MPLS circuits what type of Layer-1 connectivity have you used? If optical, what kind of optical (DWDM? Something else?) and how was that optical fiber provided to your company? If copper, did it use RJ45 connectors? Something else? Just trying to get a feel for how MPLS is physically provided to a company. Thanks!

So, my ask, is have you ever gotten a price cap negotiated with Arista before?

 The core of the matter is the fact that ChatGPT is not a source is truth, it's a word projection model. It can munge words together to create a seemingly impressive answer, but cannot definitively tell you how it arrived at its answer.

 My account rep has responded with the same stats that were linked in that thread. 
 Here is what was sent to me:
  
Regarding the presence of Fortinet Fortigate VPN our recommendation remains the same to explore ZTNA solutions. Cisco, llumio, Palo Alto, ZScaler, and Perimeter81 are some ZTNA options we recommend. 
 Using incident data and internal "insert insurance company name" claims data, we identify the propensity of cyber incidents based on company size (revenue), industry, and VPN Solution in place. An interesting stat that came out of our analysis was organizations using this VPN solution (Fortinet Fortigate) are 3x more likely to have a security incident. In other words, "insert insurance company name" predictive risk model has observed more instances of ransomware attacks at organizations utilizing this VPN solution. 
  
We are having internal talks now to decide what to do, but moving providers is one of them. I understand that ZTNA is better, but what I perceive as our threat model doesn't warrant me going that far.
 If anyone has thoughts or ideas of what to do, I will gladly take them into consideration.

Many of our customers are using and are very familiar with the older product known as Microsoft LAPS. I am very happy to say that we are delivering today a worthy (IMO) successor in Windows LAPS. Please see By popular demand: Windows LAPS available now! for more details.
 Teaser: many of you are eagerly awaiting the public preview announcement for the Azure Active Directory scenario – we’re not quite there - sorry - but it will be coming this quarter! 
 So how do you get the bits? Feel free to just run Windows Update of course, however the following doc topic will be updated later today with links to the specific KB update articles:
 Windows LAPS supported platforms and Azure AD LAPS preview status
 And for those that are might ask: yes the feature bits are available on Windows 10 today as well! :-)

 This should be of interest to many here: 
 "Welcome to the new and improved Windows LAPS! That's Local Administrator Password Solution. We've been listening to your feedback and requests, and the day is finally here for both cloud and on-premises environments.
 We're very happy to announce that new LAPS capabilities are coming directly to your devices starting with today's April 11, 2023 security update for the following Windows editions:
  
Windows 11 Pro, EDU, and Enterprise
 
Windows 10 Pro, EDU, and Enterprise
 
Windows Server 2022 and Windows Server Core 2022
 
Windows Server 2019 "
 
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/by-popular-demand-windows-laps-available-now/ba-p/3788747
 There are some cool new features for on-prem though
  
Password encryption: Greatly improves security for these sensitive secrets!
 
Password history: Gives you the ability to log back into restored backup images.
 
Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password backups: Helps keep your domain controllers secure by rotating these critical recovery passwords on a regular basis!
 
Emulation mode: Useful if you want to continue using the older LAPS policy settings and tools while preparing to migrate to the new features!
 
Automatic rotation: Automatically rotate the password after the account is used.

From what I can tell so far, the PowerShell script makes a legit-looking Windows message box pop up on your screen, telling you to call a toll-free number. Dial the number and you are cheerfully greeted by a foreign call center that will be more than happy to help you resolve all your issues. You know how it works from there ...
 All jokes aside about logmein - the fact that this URL has been around for about 10 years and organically pops up in Google search is disturbing.
 Who the hell would type a dash in the URL? No one. That's not how they get you. Because the address bar in your browser is also a search box, many people tend to type in the name of a website, and then click on the website URL in the search results. (Call it lazy or dumb or genius, but I can't tell you how many times I watch people type 'youtube' and press Enter, only to then click on youtube.com in the search results). So when you type 'log me in 123' into the browser bar and press enter, you'll see this malicious site prominently displayed on the FIRST PAGE of google.

 The thing is with current firewall setup (Well most anyone does this) how do you share a single subnet 
 The whole point is for redundancy and failover within the SD-WAN option. (Fortinet)
 Can't simply null the route as we're NAT'ing addresses and servers behind it. (First suggestion for us.)
 Asking here instead of the vendor subnet as I feel there's a large breath of know how.
 Thanks.

 I'm just trying to find a reliable access point and managed switch to pair with a Firewalla Gold, and having to read through the characteristics of dozens of similar-looking products to find the small differences between them is daunting. I would just want something where I can select my intended use (home, enterprise, etc.), the number of ports, the features I need (PoE, VLAN, etc.), and it would suggest me be the best pick. At the very least, having a usable filter to reduce the sample size would be much more intuitive.

 I can create read and write access group profile for network operator but I have feeling user profile attributes have changed so I need to really make the change at the radius server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I work for a public library, and we've got issues with our staff printer. It's connected to our network, so all of us on the staff wifi connection are able to print to it. The printer is a Toshiba eStudio3015ac, if that helps.
 ​
 The problem we're encountering is randomly, sometimes a couple times a day, sometimes weeks apart, we'll get a random print job come through that none of us sent. It'll be 100+ pages with random letters/numbers/symbols on the first page, tons of blank pages, then a random symbol/letter/number on a page.
 ​
 Our network security company wants us to call them when a print happens so they can check the packet (I'm thinking is what they said? I'm a tech guy but networking-wise I'm clueless) and see where it's coming from. Our copy company is stumped as to what's causing it--they thought it was a faulty print driver, but we've replaced them on all staff laptops and it's still causing issues.
 ​
 We've downloaded Wireshark to try and monitor the traffic, but I'm having no luck figuring out how, exactly, to monitor incoming prints on the network printer. Any ideas?

 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 Looking for some recommendations for setting up a wireless bridge between a building and a field press box. Line of sight is clear and shy of 100m. Unfortunately trenching is not an option.
 I have a couple of NanoStation M2 however, the needs will include video streaming and spectator wifi. Goal is is to add a small switch in the press box and an outdoor AP in the stands. Afraid the NanoStations would not be sufficient.
 Was looking ideally at something that would work in the 60ghz with 5ghz failover and could give me approx gigabit duplex.
 Found MikroTik "wireless wire" for about $200 which is the first time I hear of them, but is there anything similar in price and management that can be done with Unify? The "building to building bridge" is $500 and seems to need some sort of management console (I think it can run in a VM so plausible). Any decent known solutions under $500 total?

 I have been searching all over the web, Microsoft and Reddit and I can't seem to find the answer to this issue...
 I have a client that requested O365 email encryption. I set them up with a E3 license to do so. When they first went to send encrypted emails, Outlook said that Information Protection was not enabled on their tenant. I used Powershell to enable and now they can send out encrypted emails.
 The issue is, instead of the email arriving where they can open it in a browser with a code... they get an email that requires the Information protection viewer and a Microsoft account.
 This is obviously to much for most recipients to be able to handle (I know... trust me... I know...).
 Here is the thing, when I send an encrypted email out of our organization it arrives in the code/web format. However, when my client sends it... it's always a .rpmsg and requires the viewer to open.
 Does anyone know what I need to change to make it use the code/web version?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a request from our security folks to look into disabling HTTPS access on the spines and leaves in our ACI environment if we don't use it. To the best of my knowledge, we don't use the object store browser on the leaves themselves, we really only use the web interface on the APICs. I reached out to TAC and they recommended creating a new set of contracts and EPGs for in-band and out-of-band, applying a filter to block HTTPS to the contracts, and adding the leaves and spines to those new EPGs for in-band and out of band.
 I went ahead and built this and moved some leaves into the new EPGs, and the block works for out-of-band (e.g. I can nc -zv <leaf_OOB_address> 443 and get no response), but not in-band, and it's not clear why. Initially my thought was to set the filter to block 443 as a source port and add the contract as a provided contract, which seems to be what works for the OOB port. On the in-band EPG, I did the same thing, adding a filter for source port 443 > any and setting my new contract as a provided contract. That did not work, so I've since tried adding a filter for any > dest port 443, changing it to a consumed contract instead of provided, etc. I've opened up a TAC case, but they took a look at what I had configured and said it seemed right, so they're waiting on feedback from a higher level engineer to see if there's something additional needed.
 Does it sound like there's something I'm missing?

 I should first start off saying that I have no real knowledge or experience with networking. I’m an investigator trying to solve a problem here so I appreciate any simplistic answers.
 Essentially a client was extorted online through social media in which I have confirmed their IP addresses as of October 10, 2022 as:
 197.210.76.195
 197.210.76.208
 Both are Nigerian
 Through further investigation I found a suspect who logged into social media also on October 10, 2022 using the IP address of 197.210.76.99.
 What are the odds they are the same person?
 I have found similar connections in which the xxx.xxx.xxx have all matched but the last numbers were different, however they were generally a day or two apart. The above are the only IP addresses in which occurred on the same date.
 I appreciate any help on this!
 Thank you so much for the time.
 Cheers!

 It's been raised with me that we have a possibility of stale DNS records with the default scavenging time of 7 days, although this has caused no operational issue, I've had grumbles this is not best practice.
 So opening out the question, am I doing this correctly, or does everyone else have 2 week DHCP leases to endure DNS and scavenging always stays in line with DHCP. Or is 2 days perfectly ok?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, I read David Allen's "Getting Things Done" and his time management method clicked with me. It was pretty tool agnostic, and served me well for a number of years. Though I learned I needed to CYA more than most people would by archiving more stuff than most people would. I used a modified version of it for years with a decent amount of success with only a minimal of stuff falling through the cracks.
 I looked at a few other systems, such as Pomodoro, and one other one I can't recall.
 Last night, I started reading "Getting Results the Agile Way" written by J.D. Meier, who works at Microsoft. Many people praised it as an excellent time management strategy, and either a good replacement for GTD or a nice complement to GTD. I don't want to get too deep in the weeds on this, but a lot of his guiding principals just DO NOT work for me. His methodology is not about Agile project management, it's more about being agile in how you manage your work.
 At work, we're HEAVILY focused on implementing Agile. For my day-to-day work, it's been a COMPLETE AND UTTER failure. For all my project work, it's also been an utter disaster, mostly because I don't work on any custom development projects. It's all infrastructure upgrade stuff and COTS upgrades.
 I can obviously continue to use my hybrid method. But I'm curious if anyone is following a time management system that helps organize the insanity.

Aside from that, I am trying to understand how a wildcard certificate works. I have added SSL certificates in the past, but the wildcard piece I don't quite understand. 
 Once I purchase the wildcard certificate, I need a CSR. Does that CSR come from the first application I am needing my SSL certificate for? I read somewhere that I need to first add the wildcard certificate to my ADCS server first and that is where I get my CSR using IIS. This part confuses me. 
 In the future, when I need a new SSL certificate for a different application, do I log in to NS and create another wildcard certificate with a subdomain? Or do I use *.domain.com every time? I feel like if I create a new one, it will remove the previous CSR I submitted and break that application. Again, this part confuses me as well.
 I would appreciate a quick explanation of how this works. Bonus points if you have used NS before, as bad as they are.

 As part of our build hardning process, we are looking at enabling SMB signing across our laptop and desktop estate, and then eventually server estate. We are already at 80% CIS L2 compliance but this is a big sticking point for us.
 We have legacy servers. Its the ussal stuff every org has, ancient 2003 / 2008 servers running mission critical agents, databases etc. 
 I am just wanting to make sure that there werent any major gotcha's when it comes to enabling SMB singing, specifically when it comes to sysvol access. We have some legacy DCs running 2008r2 to allow our legacy xpe thin clients to communicate and want to make sure enabling it wont impact us.
 MS docs arent very helpful for this. Decomm of legacy kit is in the pipeline and is being worked on but we could do wiht some advise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there!
 I'm stuck on a problem that I feel shouldn't be so hard to crack, but I can't find a good solution for it.
 I was handed a users Windows 10 VM. For some reason the original domain user account got removed from the system a while ago and re-added and - I think for that reason - it has a different SID now. Now, there are still files in that old SID's $Recycle.bin and I was asked to recover all of them to their original location. Those files are all still there, I can see them with WinDirStat.
 Now my first instinct was, restoring files that are still in the $Recycle.Bin shouldn't be too hard, right? I mean, they are all still on the drive. But damn, I'm doing research for hours now on how to do it and can't find a way. Luckily it's a VM, so first thing I did was taking a snapshot, so nothing can go wrong when I toy around with the filesystem.
 Opening the folder in Explorer with my Domain-User Account of course is not helping since the files are tied to a different user.The next thing I tried was simply to rename the Recycle Bin subfolder, that includes the old SID as a folder name, to my SID. After I log into my user account then, Windows now tells me my Recycle Bin is corrupted and asks if I want to delete it. So, I reverted to my snapshot.
 There are tons of tools out there that can recover deleted files from NTFS, but seemingly no tools to recover still existing files from the recycler?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we’ve moved our tiny office to a new town and the new place has password protected WiFi as part of the lease using the guest wifi, which is fast enough but we’re used to having our own line for Ethernet devices and a private internal network paid for by us. 
 It being fast enough and free is a real help though, and would save us quite a lot, so we were wondering if there’s a way we can utilise it.
 Is there a way to use the guest WiFi login as the incoming line but have our own router create a new network off that with WiFi/Ethernet? We have a draytek vigor 2860ac in a box from the move along with an AirPort Express if that’s of any use, and the new building appears to be using ubiquiti circular ceiling APs of which one is in our new room. 
 I’m semi literate with all this, but there’s definitely a lot of the draytek back end that is past my current knowledge so hopefully I’ll keep up!
 Thanks very much

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 we are looking for a web-based tool for a self-management of AD-groups. Has anyone an advice? 
 To give some background: We use Linux clients company wide. So any windows-based tool is impossible or needs further expenses we would like to avoid.
 The process is that IT creates the AD-group and defines an owner. The owner (can be everyone in the company) has to check/set members. So the tool should allow to resolve nested-groups to actual people/member. The process of checking the members and the overall requirement of the AD-group itself is part of the compliance processes and belongs to the group owner.
 Right now it's resolved over tickets to the IT which blocks way too much time on the admin side. 
 Our idea is a web-tool which gives all the AD-groups belonging to the owner in a view where they can see the members and add/delete them from the group. Deleting/creating the group shall still be part of IT.

 I'm from Germany and evaluating public clouds (esp. for compute, databases, storage, etc.) for our company (30 ppl) regarding a potential migration. Coming from on-premise with dedicated servers I'm collecting pro/cons and potential challenges with a migration and looking for experiences of others who either did or did not a migration:
 - How did your setup looked like before and after migration?
 - What did go wrong during your migration?
 - What's most important to look at in preparation or during migration?
 - Maybe especially for German folks: How did you handle privacy issues (GDPR etc.) and why did you either chose a German or non-german cloud provider?
 - Are there any cloud trends we should look at specifically?
 - What would you love to see changed in public clouds (and is a regular blocker or problem for you)?
 - Which cloud are you using (and why) or why did you not migrated to a cloud?
 Thanks for any comment and thanks for sharing your experience!

 I'm a bit confused on what I can do with radius authentication on a switch DELL N2024. Inside my network I have a lot of programmers that are using some virtual machines for executing vendor based software in their laptop. These virtual machines are otside the domain and also of my control (no antivirus, no policy, ecc). I thougth of isolate the VM traffic using the network authentication in the host PC and also in the VM. The idea is to put the host inside a VLAN that can comunicate with the secure area and the VM in a restricted VLAN. The host usually use only one NIC shared, is it possible with radius authentication assign different VLAN on the same switch port based on the authentication?
 ​
 Any other suggestion will be apreciated. In the era of cryplocker the risk of keep all the traffic together is too big.
 ​
 Thank you.

 I had the same issue twice with Windows Server DHCP service in two different customers in the past few weeks.
 Customer 1: Windows Server 2016 Domain Controller (with DNS and DHCP roles)
 Customer 2: Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller (with DNS and DHCP roles)
 Issue: after installing Windows updates as scheduled, the VM reboots. After reboot, two events are generated in the Event Viewer and the VM stops giving DHCP addresses. The Lease page under DHCP panel is empty.
 Event 1: 
 ID 20090
 SOURCE "DHCP-Server"
 Description " DHCP Server is unable to bind to UDP port number 67 as it is used by another application. This port must be made available to DHCP Server to start servicing the clients."
 Event 2: 
 ID 1041
 SOURCE "DHCP-Server"
 Description " The DHCP service is not servicing any DHCPv4 clients because none of the active network interfaces have statically configured IPv4 addresses, or there are no active interfaces. "
 Resolution:
 Restarting "DHCP server" service fixes the issue. It is still unknown what exactly causes this issue.
 Has anyone encountered anything similar?

 I was trying to find an eventlog eventid for the beginning of login and for when the taskbar is loaded. I've got 7001 for beginning but haven't seen anything which matches load of the desktop/taskbar. Any suggestions would be welcome.

I have tried getting Intune Endpoint Analytics working but very few of the devices are reporting and I haven't been able to determine why. But the downside of this is that it doesn't give a number of seconds, only a score and only reflects when CPU goes below 50% after login.
 My goal is two-fold.
  
Identify problematic endpoints and/or users.
 Prove to management that the median sign-in time is reasonable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing a deep dive on IPsec right now, trying to understand what exactly is happening under the hood. Went ahead and read (portions) of RFC 4301 but I'm getting conflicting information here regarding the implementation of the SADB vs the SDB.
 In section 4.4.1.2, they walk through the structure of an SDB entry, saying that it includes the following:
  
Match criteria (selectors, names)
 Action (protect/bypass block)
 IPsec Protocol Type
 IPsec Mode
 Tunnel Source & Destination
 Algorithms
 A few other things (i.e. DF bit & DSCP handling)
  
This all sounds well and fine... then I got to 4.4.2.1, talking about the SADB... and some of the same fields are listed there again, including Algorithms (but this time described in greater detail?) as well as the DF bit and DSCP handling piece... I just figured that there was a bit of overlap or something... but then I went to Appendix C, which also describes an SDB entry... and it had even more fields listed which I thought were SADB-only... specifically, the SA lifetime.
 So I'm a bit confused here... would appreciate it if someone could answer the following questions.
  
Are the encryption & confidentiality algoritms included in both the SADB and SDB? Or is the "algorithms" piece in an SDB entry referring to something else?
 Which fields are supposed to overlap between the two databases... and also, why?

 Hey,
 Working on getting a 2022 template in place, and the admin password has been lost, no issues, thought I would reset it the old way with cmd from recovery mode and replace utilman.
 although I can get to recovery and get CMD, for the life of me I can not find what they have mapped c: to, I have been through the whole alphabet from A to Z, I get a hit on x for the recovery.
 I thought I would try from the iso and use the fix my system option, I get a hit once again on x and d this time, but only setup files, not the actual c: drive.
 VM is booting efi and secure boot is off, any thoughts? Is this method still possible or they finally removed it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 So a client the other day had clicked a phishing link, entered a password and had some mallard on her system.
 Was able to remediate the initial problem.
 However the client was intent that her system be wiped.
 While onsite, went through and backed up all of the regular folders, documents, downloads, etc.
 I asked the client if this looked okay, she stated that's fine as all of her data was mostly on the cloud. I did double check with her as I have had horror stories with this in the past and she was confident in the cloud.....
 Wiped the machine and have been working on file recovery every since as a lot of the quickbooks files were locally stored. Pulled all of them back from the dead but now they aren't working in QB.
 Feel horrible and still working on it as we speak.. please ask any questions to fill in the blanks of my panic story as I'm sure I've missed a lot of details.
 AAAAHHHHHHH :(

It really seems surreal despite ~7/8 years experience in various technology positions and ~8 years at a small MSP. This gig is different though. It’s a fairly large company with real enterprise topology and loads of technology thats new to me. I know I’ll kick ass but, I’m super nervous. I feel like I should immediately be proficient in everything even though I know that’s impossible.
 Please share your stories of your first Sys Admin gigs and let me know if you have any advice for success in my new role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my boss retired during COVID lockdown and I've been the interim since then. Went through the whole business of transitioning people to work from home and then back , lots of hours of supervision on top of my sysadmin duties, 50-60 hours work week. Since it is a state agency, we have to apply for the job officially, nobody gets a hand waive promotion if you may. So I applied and to my biggest surprise they offered the job to an outside person who has no sysadmin skills but ran a larger department with more workers. 
 That tells me that my work is not valued and I should start applying for other jobs, right now I feel pretty disappointed and angry at upper management. I have not broken the news to my staff yet because I don't want to be emotional about it, but man I am pissed. I do love being a sysadmin and not have to do front office kind of things. Maybe I will now work for the amount of money they pay me, which is low but with a lot of perks.
 What would you do?

 We have a new web application that sends LDAPS requests to our AD servers over a site-to-site VPN.
 I found out today that during the LDAPS authentication process, the remote app saves the user's password in the app's database. Presumably it's then passed to the app.
 Is this normal? I thought the LDAPS process was simply to get a success/fail authentication and that success/fail is passed on.
 Obviously I don't like my AD passwords saved in someone else's database, even if they are encrypted.

Fortunately the team thar needed to address the ticket doesn't sit in the office so headed over to my desk to expedite. (I am the head of the department with a couple levels between me and the support desk)
 I asked him if he had a ticket in, and he said "yes but need this right away for something I am doing for the CEO."
 I informed him, "if you put in a ticket our typical SLA is a day or two. It will be worked based on urgency."
 "Well can you check the status?"
 "I assure you if you put the ticket it then if is in the queue and will be processed."
 He left dejected and huff, "I don't understand why it takes a couple of days to just push some buttons."
 I always appreciate the arrogance of people who think they can name drops and bully their way into the front of the line. That isn't our company culture and I know the CEO well enough to know the would be upset if they knew I let this guy skip in line.
 For what's is worth, I reviewed what they were asking for and it isn't something that will be approved anyway. Somebody showed him a beta system that isn't production ready and now he is demanding access--he isn't a beta tester for the system and his desire is to use it for production use.
 Icing on the cake, one of my team members picked up the ticket about an hour after it was submitted and made multiple attempts to reach the manager and couldn't get a response back from them today. As usual it is ultra critical but not critical enough to actually respond.

 Now I get there is should be a vast difference in capability between the bottom and top and companies have a different requirements and risk acceptance factors.
 However I will give the example I worked at a hospice for 50k and they wanted me to hire infrastructure engineers at 23k which was just not possible for competent ones anyway. I explained the risks of hiring people that needed training and asked tounge in cheek why don’t we hire doctors without the experience to perform the role to save money? Well the answer is that’s illegal and we have to pay going rate.
 So my question in a roundabout way is IT salaries so out of Wack because there is no professional accredited body that makes doing IT work illegal without.
 Would it actually benefit IT to have such a body even just for government work. Even if it is a joke like part P or Gas safe but atleast shows some competence

R2 is receiving 'x' with a default local preference of 100. Now I want R3 to receive LP 150 so I applied the route map in the OUT direction on R2(towards R3). But R3 is still having local preference 100. I can see the change only if I applied the Route map in IN direction on R3. Same with origin code and metric. I can see changes only on applying the route map in IN direction.
 Why LP/origin/metric isn't propagating from R2 in the update message?
 Sorry for my bad grammar.

 ​
 We have a laptop refresh coming up - 25 Lenovo T14 laptops running Win10.
 We don't deploy new laptops very often - maybe every 5 years. We do not have an imaging infrastructure in place.
 I would like to keep things as simple as possible as I have other things on my To-Do list.
 Here is my plan: Please feel free to comment or add some advice as you see fit.
 ​
  
I plan on building out one of the new Lenovos with all our software and the latest updates.
 
Then sysprep it.
 Use Clonezilla to capture the image onto an SSD or thumb drive
 Then set up a small mini lab where we can deploy 4 or 5 laptops at a time with the image
 Add newly imaged laptops to domain and tweak for individual users (mapped drives, bookmarks, etc.)
  
Question. I plan on just using a thumb drive to boot up Clonzilla on the laptops and using a local SSD drive or thumb drive to host the image file for each laptop. Would it make a speed difference if I store the image file on an SSD USB -C drive as opposed to a regular USB-A drive? 
 ​
 Thanks guys for any wisdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, the following scenario came into my mind, when reading about dynamic routing/tunneling when providing a backup path to a destination.
 In the example there should be one backup path with only static routing to the destiantion, but it should react to a topology change and use the backup path(floating route). The backup/floating static route has a Administrative Distance (AD) of 5 and the primary route an AD of 1.
 https://postimg.cc/ygzqnK5H
 So, if the traffic is tunneld over IPsec (or other tunneling protocol) and the primary tunnel interface goes down, then the static route with an AD of 1 is removed from both routing tables and the second tunnel with the floating static route is used? 
 Is scenario 2 a possible solution to solve scenario 1? 
 Do vendors like cisco or fortinet behave the same way, when scenario 2 is configured?

Part of the syslog messages that we depend on is "received bytes and sent bytes" to determine bandwidth usages. This works fine for Juniper/Watchguard/Sonicwalls but now we are trying to add a Meraki MX into the mix and we can get all the info we want from it forwarded to syslog besides the bytes.
 Apparently Cisco only sends that info through Netflow. So I don't really want to purchase an enterprise Netflow collector just for this small bit of information. I don't need a fancy analyzer or anything, just something that is able to collect and forward the info we want. I have looked into a couple via Google and other posts (like ntopng) but haven't had much luck getting this working so far. Any ideas/tips are appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am seeking input from those with Cumulus Linux experience. Does it have port isolation features? I have went through the documentation on Nvidia Hub and to be honest their documentation is awful, I have not seen any topics on port isolation or PVLAN although it seems like it would be possible in linux bridge but I don't know it its integrated into switchdev and would be offloaded to the ASIC.
 Ideally I would like to have hybrid ports with untagged and tagged that are isolated from each other but able to communicate with the privileged port. Most implementation examples I see are for ONYX OS and it assumes that the restricted ports are access only. Yes it's non typical but needed in this particular situation. TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our licensing is up soon for VMWare and my rep reached out to talk about their “new, better” VSphere+ subscription model (a bunch of nonsense to just make more money off of us, by the way they want to bill PER CORE now) that they are looking to implement within the next year, though right now I have the option to re license under our previous agreement “but if I sign up for 3 years with the new VSphere+ they can guarantee my subscription pricing per core and lock in that rate”. Sounds a lot to me like they’re trying to con people into their new pricing scheme before everyone jumps ship when Broadcom fully takes over and destroys their product just like they have for everything else. I was trying to remain hopeful that maybe this time it would be different but…Broadcom hasn’t even fully taken over yet and they’ve already almost doubled my licensing cost per year with this new scheme, what a scam. I got a laugh when I got the cautionary reminder at the end of the email “the price can be locked in year over year with VSphere+, but the price can’t be guaranteed when you’re up for renewal next year if you don’t go with the proposed pricing”. 
 Needless to say, I’m going to talk to my team about it all but I believe we’re are going to be in the market for something else. Anyone have any recommendations? Has anyone else made the migration to something new recently?

 To summarise my position; I'm the IT "supervisor" but really manager. My boss is the director but still doesn managerial stuff so I'm caught in this weird limbo.
 It's a small place so I'm also not being paid well compared to others in the field but that's the tradeoff with SMBs, I think.
 My wife feels like it might be time for me to go to #4 and make a career move and I do agree with her.
 For what it matters, I'm also located in Canada.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am reaching out because I have a customer where all of their 25Gbit SFP28 links port flap connected to a Cisco ACI (that both leafs had been replaced already in.)
 The daughtercard is:
 ConnectX-4 Lx 25 GbE SFP28
 The SFPs are: SFP28-25G-SR-NOF (but I'm not sure if FEC is enabled)
 I read that the DFE tuning delay can cause the adapter to not link up when it isn't set to 3000ms, but the ports are still flapping for some unknown reason, and that seems more like a complete loss of network scenario. 
 Can FEC when mismatched on the switch and server side cause a port flap?
 The links would also not link up with the link speed forced to 25gbit, they will only link with auto negotiation.
 At one point, all of the adapters flapped at the same time.
 ​
 Any advice appreciated.

 I'm trying to configure this net:
  
3 Tagged VLANS
 1 Untagged VLAN (Default)
 Fortinet 60F Router
 Allied Telesis x510 (52 ports) Switch
  
All VLANS are connected from the router to the switch with a single cable (port that I have configured as promiscuous). Subsequently, I have configured the rest of the ports through the interface as "Untagged" ports by groups according to which VLAN I want each port to receive. 
 As I understood, with this, I should be able to connect a PC to any of the ports assigned to a VLAN (tagged or untagged) and the computer would receive internet without having to configure the VLAN ID on the network card of the computer.
 Also, I need some ports to offer multiple VLANS so that I can configure APs with guest wifi that cannot access the rest of the network.
 However, I only receive internet on the ports that I have not configured a specific VLAN.
 What am I misising? 
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently had a switch in our website hosting provider and I'm hitting my head against the wall on what I'm missing here. Everything works externally, but we have a split-brain DNS setup in our internal network. It's been set up that way for a long time and it's not something I can completely remove unfortunately, at least not right now.
 So externally, www.domain.com resolves and is proxied through Cloudflare and life is good. (see screenshot in attached album)
 Internally, however, is where things aren't currently working. Our previous hosting provider had a trusted CA issued cert installed on the origin server, and so we could simply point our internal DNS to the same public IP that CF was pointed to and everything would work fine. This new hosting provider insists on having a self signed cert on their side however. Why this is I'm still trying to figure out in my continued discussions with them, but for now that's what we've got and obviously that causes issues with 'site unsecure' warnings if we set it up like we had done before.
 So what I was trying to do is simply point our internal DNS to the CF proxied route, and per here and here I was under the impression I could simply create a CNAME entry for www.domain.com and point it to www.domain.com.cdn.cloudflare.net. (see screenshot in attached album). But clearly I'm still missing something because even with that things aren't working - Chrome gives an "ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" error even though NSLOOKUP seems to resolve to the CF IP's just fine (again, see screenshots in attached album). 
 Anyone dealt with a similar issue before? Thank you!!

 I am trying to find out the pro/cons for letting engineers have their own stipend to pick out their computers vs we pick out their computers .
 Either way they would be required to have intune and follow compliance policies. It’s only a matter of whether they tell us what they want and we order it or we pick what they use.
 Would love to hear experiences and pro/cons

 From what it looks like I may have to just get lucky ? and find a company that either is about to start this journey or already has started and looking for engineers to join the team.
 I'm using indeed and linkedin for my job searches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have been lurking for some time, and now could really use some good advice.
 The story is, we are a retail chain with around 15 stores, 2 offices and a large online presence. I came onboard about 3 years ago with the responsibility for our ERP, Azure hosting and web team. The other guy took care of all hardware, some support and the odd jobs that came up. Between us we also took care of all the different hardware and software people use. We have around 200 employees across parttime to fulltime.
 The other guy was beginning to slack a bit, came in late and did not always do his tasks, so the CEO had made a plan with me where I should be the head of IT in 6 to 12 months and we should hire more people, at minimum a Sysadmin and a Supporter.
 We had not yet presented the plan for my colleague.
 Yesterday they found my colleague dead in his apartment, and I got a call from the CEO about it, where he stated that I was now head of IT and should start as soon as possible.
 My plan is to start securing we have access to all the systems he worked with, and create a common password database in something like Bitwarden. Then talk to all the different departments about what projects they had going on, and how to get support moving forward.
 I could really use some advise, where would you guys start?
 Rest in piece other guy, I will keep your lasts sessions online for as long ass possible. You will be missed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So you may have seen my post a few weeks ago about cyber insurance deeming MFA on every single admin device, network equipment, accounts etc. We’re slowly working down our list of stuff that we need to action, but as I am not that clued up on network, our manager is the one responsible for the network and network switches across all our offices. Some of these switches are 10-20 years old, and absolutely cannot support any form of MFA, even RADIUS. The rest of the team saw this as a great opportunity for a use case to replace these old switches with something more modern and would be compliant with our requirements. Our manager has grown to have a bit of a reputation within the team of just being lazy, and only wants to touch what he knows. Whilst our insurance deems it a requirement to protect these switches with MFA, the argument we got back was “what are they going to do? Look what device is plugged in?”
 Apart from the fact these switches are almost 20 year old so have obvious security flaws in them anyway, what would the worst case scenario be if someone malicious had access to a switch within a network?

 Office repair and uninstall/reinstall
 We do not have restrictions to only allow syncing on PCs joined to specific domains

 At my desk i currently have my work macbook pro and my personal macbook pro. 
 The macbooks are hooked up to a lenovo usb-c dock for my monitor and ethernet. When i wanna switch from my work system to my home system i just unplug the usbc and replug. 
 Is there any way i can have a usb-C switch? So i can leave them both plugged in and just flip between them to toggle the connection.
 I tried googling but I’m unsure of what the name for a cable/device would be.
 I should also mention it needs to allow power delivery, display, network and usb
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many others we moved to use “known folder move” some time ago. As part of that we set up two things: 1. A baseline in sccm to check folders are in the expected locations. Eg. C:\users\Geoff\onedrive - contoso\desktop (or pictures or documents) 2. The admin reports policy so we can use the reports at confit.microsoft.com
 We hit go and watched with glee as the admin report went from 0% to around 90%. Never got to 100.. and forgot about it all as we moved to more important things.
 Now I’m reviewing our settings and status and I’ve found a couple of weird things
 Firstly some users have moved their folders into random folders, or so it would seem, like into the sub folder of some obscure project. Too few to be a mis configuration, too many for it to be accidental drag and drops.
 Secondly the admin reports have gone backwards, sitting at 75% or so
 Has anyone else had these experiences? Are you doing any manual remediation on these things? Should I be worried about any of this?!

I did buy a server for my SME back in 2019 which sadly broke down about 2months ago. After testing thoroughly and going to multiple stores that said they can fix this server. I found out its the board and the cpu that died and since Dell emailed back telling me that theres nothing they'll do because it was a few month after the warranty ended and fixing would cost as much as buying it new any board/cpu I should know that would fit right with the components I already have? I remember back when I was reusing dell's gaming pc, the mb would have its front io pins which will not work with normal pc cases in the market. I did find my way around by buying front IO cables from china that was modified for dell's front IO. I am not sure if I am wasting my time trying to fix this server, will it be difficult to find a board that fits the case? 
 The server was a EMC R340 bought in 2019 with Xeon E 2124 + R171TT1 MB 17086-1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 We have 600 legacy 'programs' that have embedded credentials so they can be installed without admin rights. (can't get rid of the at this point sadly...) 
 We've recently started a shift from onprem AD to azure with autopilot, and our domian name changed. Let's call them:
 CompanyOnPrem. com
 CompanyCloud. com
 The embedded ID authenticates against CompanyOnPrem. com\account1. This account is synchronized with AzureAD so it has the correct rights in CompanyCloud, but of course the programs won't install because CompanyOnPrem is also embedded in the install file. 
 HOWEVER! If I open anything (run CMD as a different user/admin) on the device using the CompanyCloud as the domain just once, now all the install files work perfectly.
 To summarized: 
 File has CompanyOnPrem. com\account1 embedded & will not install. 
 Open CMD as account1@CompanyCloud. com and close it. Now all install files work fine. 
 It's like running it once is creating a pointer or a DNS rescored that redirects the authentication - which is actually great for us. 
 Does anyone know specifically what is happening and where these credentials are stored?

 Tech (27/03/2020, 11:04:45): Thanks a lot
 I only wish I knew how much of a crap show it would turn out to be...I also wish I had more time to talk to the Tech, but I was getting hammered by all the people who had never worked remotely before and could not get the local / remotely connected PC concept straight.

I'm in the military and my contract is about to end, and I've set myself up to be decently comfortable doing DOD networking without a uniform. I have a degree, Sec+, CCNA, and hopefully about to pass my ENCOR. I really enjoy networking and want to get paid what I'm worth since enlisted military doesn't get paid very well. I'd like to get ENARSI soon after because it sounds fun, but even studying for the ENCOR I see how much emphasis Cisco puts on their products and automation and I really just don't get much joy from learning all that. I'm also unsure how AI and automation is going to affect the networking career field 10, 20 years from now.
 If I choose to go the cyber security route I'd have to reenlist for another 4 years and live a restrictive life with bad pay - but I'd be put on the path for some cool defensive cyber operation skills. I'd get schooling, certifications, and be working with a very very exclusive club. As far as I can tell, these guys get paid more than networking guys too. 
 I know there's a lot of people with much more experience and knowledge than me here and I was hoping maybe you could tell me something that would sway me into one direction or another.

Things like "change management" are actively avoided by senior staff because "it'll just slow us down". I try to advocate that a functional change control process should not slow down change but encourage it.
 Additionally, we had an incident occur with one of our services recently and while the response was ok, nothing was written down by my team members. No incident ticket, no post-incident review, nothing. Service is back up, incident over. I'd assume that each person has their own personal notepad++ open to write down the incident response notes.
 My direct suggested I make a proposal things I would like implement, i.e. a system for tracking changes, ongoing problems, incidents etc. but as I'm writing the proposal I find myself wondering what I'm even doing. It's obvious that this isn't even a priority for higher ups so I'm probably just wasting time right? 
 Maybe I'm getting in my own head too much, maybe I'm frustrated this keeps happening at every IT department:(

 User reports one morning her account is locked, unlock it, locked again within a minute. Go through the normal steps; make sure your phone isn’t locking you account, logged into another device, etc.
 Logs reveal Exchange is the source of the lockouts, try disabling web access, OWA, and active sync for this user. Lockouts continue. Escalate for Network help from MSP.
 They determine it’s coming from overseas multiple IPs, etc. I ask if we can Geo Lock, block it, or whatever their recommendation is. I also asked why if Web Access is disabled that the login attempts matter.
 They confer with the IT Manager and decide to have me change the user account name to [username]2. I protest that this isn’t really a fix as much as ignoring the problem. Decision made.
 I change user account to (2), and then resolve the issues with connected apps because they are now a new account for many apps. Also reset and re-enroll users MDM controlled cell phone. Issue is “resolved”.
 I don’t like this solution, but I don’t know how to explain why to the IT Manager or what I should have expected from the MSP. If anyone is willing, please give me some advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry this is slightly off topic. I work for a large organization that occasionally has phone numbers marked as "spam". We usually find out about this after a customer mentions it. We'll test on various personal cell phones and submit removal requests to carriers, and they remove the flag. 
 This only happens once or twice a year. We follow pretty strict anti-spam call policies, but sometimes they still get marked. 
 Is there an API that we can use to check numbers daily? I've tried Twilio's phone-number lookup endpoint, but I don't think it will give spam signals. We even signed up for a "phone number reputation" service that did absolutely nothing to protect our numbers. 
 Would love to know what others are doing to monitor their brand's phone number reputations.

 Not sure if this is an issue that any of you face, but how do you monitor changes the Terms of Use for your suppliers?
 We currently use approximately 1,000,000* SaaS products, along with a frankly extremely difficult ISP, who all follow the trend of: "Our ToS are at this url, it's on you to check it regularly, you have 30 days to kick up a fuss when we change them to be worse"
 Do you use a product to monitor these web pages? If so what do you use? And if not would there be some value for you in someone making one in their downtime? I am considering making something just for my own purposes, but if there's a market I'll happily release it. 
 *number may be blatant hyperbole

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So I've worked in "Networks" for almost 9 years now (wow it's gone fast!). The first 4 years I was your traditional networking engineer/admin working mainly on Datacentre and a little bit of Enterprise networks which I enjoyed but found the pace and travelling a bit stressful, although I think that was mainly due to the work culture i was in. I left that role in a hurry as the company took a turn for the worst and I got a Systems Engineering role focused on communications(networks). I've been here for nearly 5 years now and I find it quite mundane and none challenging and the pay is quite a bit lower compared to engineers working in I.T.
 I have considered going back into I.T but as ive been away from the CLI and "traditional" networking for a while I feel like I won't be able to. I guess you could say I've traded my hands on experience for more theory knowledge, understanding protocol standards, more physical layer including RF and the innerworkings of network devices and how they are integrated into a system of systems rather than end users. I know this is quite a unique situation but just wondering if any one has done something similar? Or has any opinions on me being able to get another job in I.T. Happy to answer more detailed questions if needed.

 I am curious: What devices do you use for NAT/Routing at the Uplink of big Networks (like 20 Gbit/s, 60k Clients). Currently we‘re using MikroTik CCR1072 for it, but recently discovered Netgate TNSR. For Switches, we are a complete HPE-Shop and would consider MikroTik to prosumer for the task, but somehow, we ended up with this white box in our biggest core rack … Our smaller setups use Sophos Systems, but we feel like they‘re not purpose built to be fast packet-spitting roaring routing machines.

 Right now I understand that Adtran and Nokia are probably the leaders but how do Calix and some of the other solutions (like Juniper Unified PON) compare?
 Based on my limited experience and research, Adtran seems to be the winner here for smaller deployments like my planned one but maybe there is something I don't know?
 I know about Ubiquiti Networks PON platform already and it's a possibility but I'd like to invest in something a bit more in line with what some of the other operators around me are using rather than be a one-off (even if that's the way I end up going in the end).
 Thanks in advance for your help.

 Is the advice in the Wiki for the most part still relevant? A lot of the posts it links to are are roughly a decade old and I was wondering if the advice from those posts would still hold up today.
 I understand the requirement to be constantly learning and updating skills in the field and that it is not for everyone, but I would just like to know if what I read through is still a good starting point.
 I am just considering my options as I wish to get out of my current position (retail management). I used to have a pretty strong passion for IT but it kind of died with my current career.
 Cheers.

 The switches are brand new, I tried the setup with no stacking fiber cables connected and with the cables connected too.
 I can execute every command fine, but when I get to execute
 ​
  
FS(config-vsl-port)#port-member interface Tengigabitethernet 0/49
  
​
 I get this error back:
 ​
  
Port tengigabitethernet 0/49 could not be configured to vsl. 
 Port check failed.

 I tried other ports but I get the same error, what can I do? Someone who had experience with this vendor switch? The switches are brand new with default configuration out of the box.

JG924A-1920-24G (Non-PoE), HP JD992A V1905-24-POE, and looking to get a HP ProCurve V1810-48G.

Then I need SFPs between the 48G and the 24G, the fibre cable will have to run about 50 meters. If anyone can point me to which ones I need that also won’t break the bank it would be much appreciated. Tia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have to communicate with a set of wifi enabled electrical relay switches and video monitors around the perimeter of a field. Since the maximum ethernet range is about twice the range as wifi, it seemed like it would be easy to use the wifi access points as ethernet repeaters if I can find the right units and daisy chain them around the field. Power is easily available the whole way. Is this a good way to do it? If so, what are good wifi units that would let me do this?

 When our email archive went offline previously, O365 queued emails and sent them when it was back online (~1 hour) but I'm not able to find any documentation on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was like 15 years ago. We had a client come in that was the most sexist human being I've ever met and I have worked with people from all levels of wealth and from like 30 countries.
 It was him, me, and our site manager(a woman) in a conference room with him sitting across from me and the site manager sitting next to each other. Every time the site manager asked a question, he would make it quite clear that he was responding to me because he was disgusted that a woman was in charge of the site. It was insane to watch and be the person he chose over responding to a lowly woman. I didn't know what to do. I was young and new to the company. If it happened now, I'd be all, yo, this is unacceptable but where I was in my life at that time, I chose the passive aggressive route.
 You really have to picture this in your head because it really went down this way.
 She would ask a question, he would look at me to respond, and I slowly leaned over until my head was behind hers so he had to at least look in her direction while speaking.
 She was clearly and understandably appalled at the situation but she was also trying not to laugh at what I was doing.
 Side note: The primary owner of our company is awesome and later that day told that guy to gtfo of our building and our contract was cancelled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our security policy, we have a highly segmented, firewall and switch routed network with next generation Web Application Firewalls.
 When setting up new servers, production machines, cloud services or new (client/server) applications, our firewall team needs to be involved. While that's perfectly fine, it feels like a new endeavor every time, even if it's the third or tenth machine of the same type.
 We need to specify source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols (and I'm happy with that), but don't have a very structured and repeatable approach in doing so. And the firewall teams documentation of rules and changes "in the firewall" seems somewhat intransparent. That process is time consuming with repeated discussions on why we need this port or that protocol and we sometimes end up with issues because of that.
 Can you share or recommend a lean process on requesting, documenting, and auditing firewall rules? Please also point me to other reddits if I am a bit off topic here.

 We're currently using Meraki, and I'm not overly keen on it. Crazy expensive hardware and licenses, increasingly common hardware failures, pretty average feature sets. Yet somehow it sort of just works. We can create a site to site VPN easily, manage switches and APs and firewalls from anywhere, and I have to say, I like that. 
 I was looking at potential other solutions. From their marketing, you would think Ubiquiti would be a good choice - absolutely not, I wouldn't use their stuff outside of SOHO or prosumer environments. With the possible exception of HP Aruba, it looks like most alternatives means leaving that single ecosystem that I've actually come to take for granted to an extent. Perhaps renewing the licenses next year is the best plan?
 But in any case, I'm interested to know how other people manage their networks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an odd request, but please hear me out. My company provides control panels with very small (like 2-3 device) isolated TCP/IP networks. Occasionally, a device needs to be serviced by connecting a laptop with programming software installed. This software interacts over a TCP/IP connection with the devices in the panel. The software is expensive, difficult to install, and difficult to license. It is not something we could just send an installer to our customers to install on a local laptop, most of the time. Furthermore, asking to remote into a customer's machine would be seen as unprofessional in this industry.
 I may post a similar question on /r/plc where I normally hang out, but I am looking for something more than the current ways I've seen/done this:
  
VERY EXPENSIVE - drive or fly to the site just to plug in an ethernet cable to the laptop with the right software on it.
 MEDIUM EXPENSE - send a laptop with the software installed to site with instructions for site personnel to get it connected to the panel's switch. This ties up a full set of software licenses (this can be 5 figure licenses)
 MEDIUM EXPENSE - send or permanently install a dedicated cellular VPN box (usually netbiter, eWon or Secomea) out that puts the engineer's licensed laptop on the panel's network
 LOWEST EXPENSE - if the customer has the right combination of competency and flexibility in their IT dept, set up VPN access to the network 
  
Ok, so here's where I'm wondering if there's a 5th option. Is there a way to set up a laptop that just functions as a VPN server, rather than client. Like, is there a cisco or whatever program I can install on a win10/11 laptop that, when running, allows remote vpn clients to access the laptop's local network? 
 All of the above is typically done as supervised, extremely temporary connections to these systems. I am aware these all represent security risks except #1. Please refrain from chastising my industry for our security practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work maybe 6-7h each day, really not that much compared to what I read from other guys in this sub. However during that time I am hyper focused. The only break that I take is 30 minutes for lunch, and I mean really no other break at all. I don’t kick back in my seat, take care of personal stuff or get up to walk around the room for a bit. Instead I jump from one task to the next, whether that’s a meeting, monitoring alert, ticket, project, chat message, email, you name it. The stimulation is just so intense that I can’t get out once I’m in. What I don’t realize during that time is that I’m completely overstimulating by brain. I don’t give it time to process anything. So once I stop working my mind starts racing about everything I touched throughout the workday. I go over the meeting in my head, I think about if I forgot something on the ticket I worked on, if the next steps for the project are correct, etc. I go to bed with these thoughts and I wake up with them. Only after about 2 days of not working (typically on Sundays or today after a holiday) the thoughts start to slow down. This really sucks because I am not fully present with my family unless I’m on holiday and generally I’m just burning myself out. I know what I shouldn’t be doing but I just can’t stop it. I tried a couple of things to mitigate that:
  
A physical alert on my desk which goes off after 2h to remind me to get up (which I happily ignore once I’m into the vortex)
 A tool on my computer which actually blocks the screen for 5 minutes to force a break (which annoyed me too much when I was deep into something or in a meeting)
 Countless of post-its to remind me of breaks (which you guessed it, I ignore)
  
Have any of you experienced the same and found a solution to this?
 PS: I should mention that neither my boss or any external factor are forcing this behavior on me. While I had jobs in the past where that was the case, today it’s not.

 I understand there is a cultural language and time barrier, and I've pleased with leadership to send me over there to get a better grasp on things and their userbase and workflows. I guess I am more venting than anything because I've tried just about everything to help them out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I have been tasked with bringing my building into the 21 century.
 We now have keyless entry, voip phones, and some wifi. Problem all these devices use POE and I have three floors to cover. So I have switches on three floors. The switches are older surplus 3com which were donated. (we are a non-profit fraternal org). 
 I would like to get my infrastructure on one one type of hardware at a reasonable price. 
 Number of office employees is only 4. But when members show up we need ability to serve up wifi .
 Most of the device connections are POE devices, doors, phones, ap's .
 Looking for switch and ap recommendations. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there.
 We currently utilize Barracuda for our Third Party Spam Filtering. MX->Barracuda->O365.
 The only inbound connector we have is scoped to only accept mail from Barracuda IPs.
 Mail Rule to set the SCL to -1 when mail is received from Barracuda IPs to ensure O365 scanning is bypassed.
 We recently upgraded our Microsoft Licensing which allows additional email security on the O365 Side. 
 While Barracuda does a pretty good job at keeping the bad-guys away, I'm considering layering *some* of the scanning/security such that any email that comes into our organization, first passes through Barracuda for Scans, then an additional scan is done at the O365 level before delivering to the user mailbox.
 Seeing the recommendation is to enable Enhanced Filtering.
 https://campus.barracuda.com/product/emailgatewaydefense/doc/96023002/enhanced-connectors-vs-mail-flow-rules-for-spam-filtering/
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/enhanced-filtering-for-connectors#what-happens-when-you-enable-enhanced-filtering-for-connectors
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-mail-flow-using-third-party-cloud#scenario-1---mx-record-points-to-third-party-spam-filtering
 ​
 I'm assuming this is a modification to the existing inbound connector to enable Skip Listing, and the SkipIPs then become a list of IPs that Barracuda uses - essentially allowing us to keep the scoping in place for the connector to only allow Barracuda IPs. We would then 'remove' the SCL-1 rule.
 While this might come with some additional management - I can see the benefits of having an integrated filter in place (Impersonation etc etc).
 Anyone else setup this way? Pros? Cons? lessons learned?
 Appreciate the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone. 
 I joined this company around 1.5 years ago. Great company, nice people and 100% remote. I was hired to manage a Windows environment and some small Azure related projects. Down the road last year, a few key people in the company quit and I had to step up to take more responsibilities especially for managing other cloud environments (AWS/Linux and some DevOps) and I was told at that time that they'll look into getting a raise for me. I also got a few Azure/AWS certs and spent many extra hours to learn and manage these environments. Although, besides the regular 5% annual raise, there haven't been any discussions around the raise. I really enjoy my time working here but I have been told by others to start looking somewhere else but my experience has been very good with the company, and also having imposter syndrome to apply elsewhere. Would like some advice on where to go from here. Thanks! Location: ON, CA. Sal: C$60k

 We have a "Cisco like" 4 port router (not gonna get too into details on the router due to company stuff) and we're using a satellite modem to reach back to another end. Our issue currently is that we magically had connectivity on the router for probably 2 minutes, then can't ping the modem. We changed the FE 0/0 port to be in the same "net" as the modem (just changed it to a .3 because modem is a .1 and the dish controller is a .2) and was told to add "ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1" into our config but can't even ping the modem anymore. Any thoughts? I'll answer some questions if you have any, but will keep some stuff vague due to company stuff

 i have been using session buddy for a while, in order to at least save the tabs i have setup for a browser. Since browsers have the ability to group tabs, i would love to save not only the tabs themselves but of course also the groups. Restoring tabs is not an issue, but having then to manually setup the groups and add the tabs is painfull (esp. across multiple devices). Session buddy does not do this. 
 Anybody know of an extension (chrome) that saves both? and maybe even syncs the profile + tabs + groups + extensions? 
 thanks in advance for any usefull hints :)
 Edit: I found the flag #tab-groups-save so i will test that (sadly it is experimental)

 They act like people will die if they don't stay late to complete whatever task. Then they come into work depressed the next day, expecting other staff to feel sorry for them for being the "hero" who worked late. Bad luck, no one notices because other staff are living their best lives.
 Reality check 1:
 Your job isn't that important, you aren't saving the world. And that's OK.
 Reality check 2:
 Your boss is not your friend. If they were, they wouldn't let you work late. They would care about your health and wellness.
 You are an employee. Work hard but go home on time. If your boss says there's too much work, that's a management problem. They need to hire more people. You still go home on time. If they don't like that, find another job. I've been there. Yes, it's really that simple. You are exchanging time for money. This is just a business transaction.

Ever since I've popped my 3389 and 3390 ports open I've noticed brute force attempts in the security events logs. Pretty lame attempts at that, as they try different usernames with every attempt, with the occasional consistent administrator account. 
 I guess my question is, even if they were to successfully brute force my password, wouldn't they hit the same 2FA prompt that I do when I access remotely? Would they be able to access any other areas of the network or devices? I also have all my devices running through NordVPN when home which blocks all external access.

 I get no budget / spending power and they do not want to spend a PENNY on I.T / Sec. 
 I asked them if we can expand into an MSP space and they said yes, just to take it back after I signed clients and started working telling me “your job is on-demand because it’s break-fix and not full time” ( I AM THE ONLY ONE THERE AND YOUR COMPANY’s IT IS A DUMPSTER FIRE)
 I stayed patience up until yesterday where my boss assured me she’d have a compensation structure for me and the MSP vertical. I scheduled a resignation at 5:00 the next day because I knew she wouldn’t do anything and I gave them a week’s notice. 
 This is the text I got: “Your resignation is accepted and is effective immediately. Let’s coordinate a time this weekend to meet in order to go over any pending assignments and for you to transfer any assets you have to the firm. Also, please clean out your office by Sunday evening. 
 Thank you for your service and we wish you all the best in all of your future endeavors. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. 
 All the best!”
 And they sent an email not including me to the rest of the staff saying that my last day was today. Like dude, I quit, don’t make it sound like you fired me. 
 I’m trying hard to not exact revenge. I was too loyal is the problem.
 Not worth $20 / hr to have every position at the same time. I polished my resume and fucked out of there before the inevitable disaster.
 Please be blunt and tell me if I’m dumb. You may need more info, I had so much shit today I forgot 90% of it.

I called again after they put the ticket on hold and requested they escalate again and reach out via email. They reached out via email requesting information and I provided everything they asked for immediately. Radio silence until I called again. Then I got an email saying my ticket has been escalated to tier 2 support. Radio silence yet again. It’s now been 30 hours since we put in the ticket and nothings happening. 
 The express ticketing status page went down around 12pm today so I can’t even see if someone’s actively working on it or not. I tried just scheduling a tech to come from the level 1 support but apparently that can’t happen without circuit team initiating it. Level 1 support somewhat admitted they have been having issues reaching the circuit team but when they saw my ticket they got audibly nervous so maybe it was just a mistake. 
 Other rant about AT&T don’t let your equipment go down or they’ll give away your IPs and they won’t even give you DHCP til you call …if you can get a hold of them. Have a new customer that just got dedicated fiber from them I set up their network a month ago got the service online but they didn’t need it for a month and a power outage knocked them offline permanently but they didn’t know until it was time to use it. Took a week to get a technician to come in and reprovision the equipment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question for the Linux admins out there: is it actually worthwhile to put effort into learning vi?
 I've spent most of my sys admin career in a primarily windows environment, but I've recently moved to a shop that's about 50/50. Early in my career, I was advised to never bother, and just use nano instead, which works enough like a regular text editor that anyone can use it with no special training. 
 The problem is I now catch a lot side glances from the career Linux guys for using nano. The people who have primarily worked in Linux all seem to be VI guys.
 I haven't really put effort into learning it, my vi knowledge is basically :q! If I accidentally open it.
 What do you guys think, is it actually something worth learning, or is it just a preference thing? Alternately, is it worth doing just as a marker for being a Linux pro?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bunch of routers at remote sites that I am trying to get a rough idea of their average traffic in bps out of a certain interface based on their counters. I'm just wondering if my methodology makes sense. Obviously there are better ways to do this but I was not given the lead time to setup monitoring and gather enough data.
 First I take the counter uptime in weeks and days and calculate the total number of seconds.
 TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS = (((UPTIME_WEEKS * 7) + UPTIME_DAYS) * 24) * 3600 
 My goal is to get a rough idea of the usage per second. But most of this traffic is during working hours and the uptime above is 24/7. So I divide by 5 since after nights, weekends and holidays I figure the vast majority of traffic is generated in just 20% of the time
 TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS = TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS / 5
 Then I calculate the number of bits from the number of bytes in the counters
 TOTAL_BITS = TOTAL_BYTES * 8
 Then I calculate the bits per second by dividing by the TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS
 AVG_bps = TOTAL_BITS / TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS
 Obviously this is a very rough average not taking bursts into account but I'm also taking some random 5 min average readings will pad the result. Just wondering if I went totally off-the-rails somewhere. 
 Thanks

 I am sure many of you know what KnowB4 is. For those that don't, it is a security awareness training program that helps users to take extra precautions when it come to opening emails and trickery of phishing and whatnot. 
 When we sent out a test campaign, and a user falls for it, they user will get a training class assigned to them where they'll have to watch it and take a quiz helping them not fall for it again in the future. 
 We started this about a year ago, but lately we have users who get supper offended when they fall for one the campaigns that get sent to them and get really upset that they have to do the class and quiz. It is starting to really piss me off. They're thanking we (IT) purposely are trying to make them fall for it so we can give them a shitty day. That isn't the case. We are better safe than sorry. 
 What I need help with is who can draft me a crafty email explaining how it isn't us against them and that this tool is there to help us all take extra precautions rather than feeling that IT is trying to make you fall for those tests. 
 Because as I am drafting the email, I finding it to be in a very pissed off tone which is making me hesitant to send it to the whole company. Who is good at making this email tone very firm and a**holic, but at the same time friendly? lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope somebody can help me find an answer. Unfortunately my past network architecture experience is almost a decade out of date and was with Brocade/Fastiron. We did a lot of mesh IP networks matching SAN network meshes, and it was amazing.
 I'm now in a position and we are considering using Edgecore/Wedge with CumulusLinux for a network rollout. I'm trying to figure out if its possible to do a PoD type network mesh design, but I'm coming up short as I search the internet. We haven't purchased these so we also have no support contact as of yet.
 What I have is a group of 8x racks with two switches per rack, and I'm debating what will be the best configuration to avoid or at least reduce having to do the classic multi-layer datacenter aggregation of switches to switches. We also won't be controlling the upper networks, it'll just be going directly into an ISP from within each group of 8 racks, and I want them cross-connected for faster local networking.
 If anybody knows if this is possible, thanks!
 I know I can create bridges between switches, that's fairly normal stuff. It's when you get loops even within a mesh that I'm less certain about.
 [edit]
 To clarify: What I have in mind is a classic star-mesh network from the SAN world, but in the IP world. I don't know if this is possible with this gear. It is possible with FastIron, but that might be the extent of it, and nobody else has done this sort of thing. I know Brocade was trying to push it as an open standard but after their demise maybe it just fell away.
 If not, then what is the next-ideal configuration, with 16 switches, and 2x uplinks?

 It's been a month since my internship has begun at an MSP. It's a 100% remote position and most days, I do nothing except participate to 1 to 3 useless meetings.
 Of course, I already talked to my boss about it (I would say something like "hey I have free time right now, If I can be of any help for anything please reach out to me") And when I say that, he would always ask someone in the team to call me on Teams to explain 2-3 projects they are working on, but it's useless because each time they would not give me any work to participate in these projects, they are always waiting on dependencies to be solved by someone else so I just have to wait.
 My worst issue is the daily stand up meeting where I always have to make up something to talk about.
 Do you think it's a common issue during an internship or at the beginning of a new job? I feel so bored. I was working on many exciting projects while I was a student and I miss this time so much.
 Sorry if my english is not perfect - french is my first language.

 Hi all
 We have an old handmedown mx480 we barely utilize. It has a pair of 16xge cards in it now. We are planning to add another card later this year thanks to some growth.
 I didn’t realize one of those cards was damaged early on and wrecked two of the backplane slots (:() forcefully trying to get the xge card with slightly bent rear pins in. Rookie mistake. It also has only re-s-2000s in it. It seems to be doing fine now with the four full tables it gets but I know I’m pushing my luck, it runs 32 bit junos (and from what I can read, only supports up to what it runs now at 15.1), and we probably will be adding significantly more routes over next few years.
 I’d like to get something that is newer but still used and has potential for another 4-6 years of JunOS support. I’m happy with the mx480 platform and am not angling to change. Especially since if I get a newer chassis I can reuse my existing power supplies and have a spare fan module. Is the mx480- bp3 chassis with scbe2/re-s-1800x4-32g new enough to achieve that goal? Latest JunOS for a while, full tables, relatively newish.
 So far as I can tell, even the current MX isn’t stressed out at all…. I really am just thinking about the next half decade more than the now. Rather make the change now than when more people will be impacted. https://postimg.cc/GBxyfqj2
 EDIT: the big cpu spikes were me switching routing engines so I could reboot them. Four plus years uptime. Some things were acting up like a snmp poll taking 7 minutes. That’s not from normal load.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For various reasons, I need to start some trials with Windows 365. In looking at the cost for what they consider 'standard' the 41.00 per month seems a bit high. I would like costs to be in the 20 to 25 per month if possible. I'm wondering if they are other vendors in this space doing anything similar that are reputable with similar specs. Windows 11 is a must, but it does not need to connect to local resources. Essentially, a Windows desktop accessible from any standard internet-connected computer. Ideally, I don't want to host my own hardware, the environment would be desktop as a service. It may just be this is what the market is and that's fine, but I wanted to cast a wider net and make sure I'm not missing something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All DCs are currently W2K16, but will be swapped out for all W2K19 in a few months. All DCs support only "RC4, AES 128, AES 256" encryption types (no DES). 
 Some AD accounts (mostly computer objects for Linux systems with Centrify agent installed) support only "DES, RC4".
 Some other accounts (also Centrify systems) support "DES, RC4, AES128, AES256". The rest (vast majority Windows systems, nothing lower than W2K12R2/Win10) of accounts don't support DES at all. 
 Question 1: Without the DCs supporting for DES, is having "DES" as a supported type on a bunch of computer objects an actual risk item? We are logging everything into Splunk and there are zero events indicating DES is in use. These accounts turned up in an internal audit, but the actual risk seems non-existent. We will remediate them anyway but I'm wanting to be clear on the risk for management discussions. 
 Question 2: Right now in Splunk I see AES in use, but also RC4 being used, even involving systems that have support for AES128 and AES256. I think I've read that once we switch to W2K19 DCs this behavior will change, and the DCs will start negotiating with the highest encryption level available. Is that accurate? We want to work towards phasing out RC4, so if the above is true, we should immediately see a big drop in RC4 traffic after we swap out our DCs this summer.

 Built-in bot for online chat with customization options (desirable, but we can make our own).
 Customization (some kind of integration, apps or at least built-in functionality)
 Tools for metrics analysis (SLA, statistics, etc.).
  
We won't have voice support, so we plan to communicate via online chat only. Also in the support will work no more than 5 employees in shifts in a 24 by 7 mode. If someone is away for lunch, the bot has to help somehow and create a ticket, so that the client does not just sit there.

 SMTP soft linking (proxy address attributes and email field) - this created a second account if it synced at all) 
 Hard linking by setting azure identities immutable ID to the on prem object GUID by translating it from base 64…
 The GUIDS will not throw any errors on sync, it’s the duplicate UPN and SMTP:username fields that won’t sync and show duplicate errors. 
 I thought this was possible…
 Last idea - export PST and remake.

 Could someone point me to the relevant portions in the standards where exactly this is derived from?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've had a phishing campaign target users within our company, all the usual markers aren't present, so this hasn't been quarantined by our Email Gateway.
 Pretty much, each email sent comes from a different mail server (all "good / neutral" reputation), they're all different in content, but all have a "*.pdf" attached (no set naming scheme to these either).
 Each of the emails only goes to a few users so isn't being caught via "bulk" sending either. Obviously we've been adding the mail servers into the block lists along with the domains as they come in.
 We've had KnowBe4 running campaigns for years now, so our end users knew what to do (don't open anything, report it, etc.). We sent out an email to all users, just informing them of what is happening, and to be vigilant.
 I don't think much more can be done to prevent this, other than keep up training for users, keep them informed of threats (as we've done).
 All the mail servers aren't within our country and we don't do much business outside of this country, so I could restrict all inbound mail just to our country (then just allow through what's need when it's needed).
 I have got a support case open with our Email Gateway provider, as a few of these emails used the name of end users and should of been caught by "Impersonation Prevention" but it marked them as "Legitimate".
 Any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am searching for a relatively cheap 2m4ghz only wifi router or access point. I don't need a lot of speed and not a lot of devices but would like a big coverage with reasonable speed (above 20mbps) for around 50 devices, so I was thinking a high powered 2.4ghz ap would make the most sense,. The other option would be a mesh system, but I would prefer a single ap. 
 Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know about other countries, but in the UK we are just about to undertake probably the biggest telecommunications project a generation, namely the switch off of pstn phone networks.
 We already have problem dates coming up quick, virgin media will turn off all phone lines supplied by pstn copper in July this year, then in October all EoFTTC and EFM products we get from Zen are disconnected, and then there is the simple stop sales like no standard DSL or FTTC from September. The new products SoGEA does not cover all sites, if you had a line that was DSL only you might be out of luck, and nothing comes with the SLA of EoFTTC or EFM without doubling the cost and going fibre leased line.
 I wonder what people are doing? Personally anything voice we are just shunting to mobile 3G/LTE, the data is going to have to be SoGEA, but we have already identified areas where the service level is reduced or simply no current replacement product meets the same spec.
 It's all flipping annoying 😔

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I am in need of some assistance with a project I am working on. I have been tasked with creating an automatic warranty checker for Dell servers, and I am hoping to use Nagios to achieve this. I have found an API for Nagios that was created in 2012, but unfortunately, it is no longer functional. I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with creating a Dell server warranty checker using Nagios and would be able to offer any guidance.
 The objective of this project is to create a system that will allow Nagios to self-check the Dell website by service tag and display the warranty status of the server in Nagios, or alternatively, send an email notification. This would help us keep track of the warranty status of our servers and allow us to take action before the warranty expires.
 I would appreciate any help or guidance on this matter, whether it be through pointing me in the direction of helpful resources, providing suggestions on how to tackle this project, or sharing personal experiences with similar projects.
 Thank you in advance for your assistance!

        <updated>2023-04-07T07:15:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an Ansible playbook that can modify the VLAN configuration of Cisco switch ports. Here's an example of the host_vars:
 interface:
 GigabitEthernet1/0/1:
 mode: trunk
 GigabitEthernet1/0/2:
 access_vlan: '100'
 mode: access
 voice_vlan: '200'
 stp_portfast: enable
 GigabitEthernet1/0/3:
 access_vlan: '100'
 mode: access
 voice_vlan: '200'
 stp_portfast: enable
 ...
 Here's the task, which works well and allows me to configure the ports by calling the 'port' tags:
 - name: assign access port
 cisco.ios.ios_l2_interfaces:
 config:
 - name: "{{item.key}}"
 mode: "{{item.value.mode | default (omit)}}"
 access:
 vlan: "{{item.value.access_vlan | default (omit)}}"
 voice:
 vlan: "{{ item.value.voice_vlan | default (omit) }}"
 state: merged
 with_dict: "{{ interface }}"
 when: (item.value.mode is defined and item.value.mode == 'access')
 tags:
 - port
 Let's say I want to make changes to G1/0/30. I can make the changes in host_vars, and run the play, however, as you know in Ansible, it will go through each port, validate them, and eventually make changes to G1/0/30. 
 The problem here is that it takes a long time to configure a single port, If I have a stack switch, can't even imagine, it will take forever.
 The time it takes to configure a single port using SSH CLI now takes no longer in ansible, which defeats the whole purpose of automation. This will get even trickier during a troubleshooting calls.
 So if anyone who has successfully used Ansible in their network, do you know how to deal with this situation?
 I am looking for a solution where I can invoke the playbook for only the specific interface. without so much change

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, so I have a little chart I'm creating (for my own reference) that estimates one-way & round-trip latency based on mileage. I'm aware in long-distance networks, propogation delay is based around the speed of light (1ms of latency per 125km, *when traveling over physical media). However, the figures I'm observing in real-life are higher than would be suggested by this.
 Example: The RTT between New York and San Francisco should theoretically be around 48ms. However, the actual figures observed are closer to 70ms.
 With this in mind, where is the attentional latency coming from, and is there a good "rule of thumb" multiplier that I can use to estimate latency? I'm aware that serialization & processing delay is a thing, but given today's interface speeds, I can't see how that could possibly add up to anything significant. Does the added latency come from the fiber optic medium itself? The fact that light is not traveling in a vacuum? Some sort of operation on the ROADMS?

It happens only onmobiles ghat too only on my wifi connected devices. Mobile data and laptops seem fine.
 I stopped the site entirely as I was worried and flushed out dns of my browser and changed router dns, password, etc. Still the problem is not resolved.
 Is my website hacked? If it is it must happen to all, other colleagues checked and it works fine there. It works fine on my tablet and laptops and over mobile network.
 Can I do anything to find the root cause?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there fellow networkers! I am running into a particular issue that I am researching a better solution. I am primarily a PON engineer so I am used to working in that space but as my ISP that I work for is transitioning away from Active E setups, besides for enterprise customers, and moving more to XGS-PON for connections, I am running into an issue with MDUs, mainly apartment complexes. 
 ​
 We install a 48 port L2 switch then through the CLI, apply traffic shapers accordingly to what the customer is paying for on that interface instead of installing a managed router or some kind of CPE equipment. This is great and all being fed from a Active E connection or even now a XGS ONT since the apartment complex doesn't want to run fiber to all the units and want to re-utilize all the copper connections so we install a managed switch. So far this works for a dedicated NOC tech to turn up or down or apply different traffic shapers to the interface but that generates a lot of tickets for work that I don't want them doing all day long but I can't necessarily teach the customer service or billing people to do those tasks. 
 ​
 Now we do run UNMS/UISP because we use it for managing GPON ONUs via UOLT, ERX, Air Cubes and other Ubiquiti products but I keep seeing stuff about the UISP Switch Pro being able to apply Traffic Shaper profiles and turn up/down interfaces with ease. Before I order one for testing, is it just as easy with the new CRM system to create a customer, apply a service plan and assign a port interface just in a similar fashion as the GPON ONUs? If so, that would alleviate a lot of manual work!

A lot of the general work is spent on maintenance and using tickets with CV to get things done. 
 The other part of the question is which solution would work with Salesforce the best. CommVault really lacks in features for SF and isn't even on the app exchange. I know cohesity just got a partnership with Ownbackup so that is good and something we are considering. 
 But from everyone's experiences what would be the recommendation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So at my work we have many devices that connect over a 485 wire, the system is close to EoL and we want an easyish way to upgrade our customers without having to pull cat6 for the new system. the main question is would MoCa adapters be a good fit to convert the 2 wire to ethernet (obviously using a bnc or coax adapter)
 -Would like to be able to have a one "head end" device that could go into the facility network and then multiple endpoint devices for the different devices on the current 485 loop
 If this is possible with MoCa, what would be a good recommendation? Any Ideas would be appreciated

 There's lots of blog posts as well as paywalled websites on the subject of IT internships; I was hoping to get feedback from guys and gals in the trenches. I've been sysadminning for decades but have only been at the director level for a short time.
 Looking for feedback on the good and bad of programs others have administered or participated in.

 The Lord's Security Engineer's Prayer:
  
Our security engineer, who art in the server room,
 Hallowed be thy firewall.
 Thy authentication come,
 Thy audits be done,
 In the cloud, as it is on-premise. 
 Give us this day our daily encryption,
 And forgive us our security breaches,
 As we forgive those who breach our PII.
 Lead us not into compliance failures,
 But deliver us from cyber threats. 
 For thine is the network, the power,
 And the glory, of ranch,
 Forever and ever. 
 Access granted.

 It's me that asked you to support your service, foolishly thinking that you would do something to take care of your customer.
 It's me that needed to know when your service was going to have scheduled downtime, and had the nerve to ask for notifications ahead of time. In over 4 years I've never received a notice for a single planned outage - despite asking repeatedly.
 It's me that has opened over 100 support tickets with you for various failures in your service in the last 6 months. 
 It's me that is tired of being grilled by the execs, wondering when I'm going to be done giving you 2nd, 3rd, 47th, and 184th chances.
 It's me, Bluepeak Communications, that's sick of your horseshit telco network, and your abject failure to support your customers. But it's you who is going to lose a big customer because you don't seem to give a damn when we tell you something's wrong.
 Thanks for letting me vent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m in an odd situation here. I’ve spent the last 15 years of my life buried in the CLI to become the best network engineer I could. I got my BS degree (bullshit degree I call it), I got my CCNA r/S, CCNA Voice, CCNP r/S, and I’m working to renew it into an CCNP Enterprise…. But I’m burnt out. 
 I work so much that it’s crumbled my personal/family life. I’ve also grown into an alcoholic over the years. I’ve worked the 12 step program but with the stress of my job – I keep going back to the boos. It’s time to make a change. 
 So I’ve been putting out apps for jobs that I’m essentially overqualified for – main reason is so I can go to work and not have to stress. I can set up a VLAN instead of design a whole VXLAN from scratch. I can make sure the link lights are up – instead of delve into the CLI for 3 hours trying to troubleshoot things down to the packet level… At least – this is my plan. 
 I have a final interview for a NOC 3 position. The pay is surprisingly good for a NOC job and based off what I learned in my second interview – this job should be a breeze. 
 So my strange question is – has anyone taken a step BACK from the hard charge “study everyday” mentality? If so – did it help your personal life? What’s it like working in the NOC from the perspective of a more senior guy? I ask because most NOC techs I’ve worked with were early career (justifiably so). I’ve never worked in a NOC but everywhere I’ve worked has had one – so I’m familiar with most duties. 
 I’m doing this to save my marriage, personal life, and get my shit back together – and I’m blessed in that the paycut is not all that bad since I’ll be a t3… No they haven’t given me an offer but I told them my bottom line number and they still called me back 1 hour later to do the final interview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We started getting emails from staff about emails not getting received/delivered and noticed that MS Defender is blocking most valid emails, which are flagged as spam or phishing. 
 We added the domains and email addresses to the safe-sender lists (Policies & rules > Threat policies > Anti-spam policies > Anti-spam inbound policy > Allowed and blocked senders and domains) and also created and safe-sender lists via Exchange Admin > Mail flow > Rules and still valid emails added into the safe-sender list are still getting blocked.
 We enabled notification when emails are quarantined, and staff will have an option to "Review Message," "Request Release" and "Block Sender." We will get notified and have two ways of releasing the quarantined emails.
 ​
 Release
  
- This option will have an option to "Submit the message to Microsoft to improve detection (false positive)
 - Allow emails with similar attributes (URL, senders, etc.)
 - then you specify the "Remove allow entry" to 1, 7, 30 days, or a specific date
  
Approve release
  
- selecting this option "will send the message to Microsoft for analysis and evaluation."
  
It doesn't matter which option we select. Even adding to the safe-sender lists, valid emails are getting blocked. Are you experiencing the same issue with MS O365 Defender? Any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks

I come from a federal background where we had to have MFA on everything, and it didn't matter if we were on the internal network or accessing the network remotely. However at my new organization (which handles mostly banking clients) it seems the overall trend is no MFA for internal access to the domain, but only if the user is working remotely. Is this common? Is this best practice? I feel like MFA should be configured for external and internal but maybe I'm biased? What do you think?

We need further discussion to talk about kinds of access, and we discussed reasons for limiting how many people can make changes to SharePoint sites. 
 Overall, the in-person discussion went well, and I feel like this is back under control. 
 I appreciate everyone who had a thoughtful comment and offered good suggestions
 Original Post:
 This request came in yesterday. I told them we can't do that, but I'm still getting pressure. I've asked them what they're trying to do and exactly what kind of access they want, but that giving the HR director access to folders that could contain customer PII is a non-starter. The COO just changed the request to all Operations sites, which seems OK for the COO, but still not HR. 
 I've cited potential fine, lawsuits, and failing third-party investor due-diligence IT audits. 
 I have an informal meeting with them today and will hopefully get some insight into their goals, but as of now I have no idea why they want HR to have this access.
 Any thoughts?

 How do you handle accounts in your warehouses with people that are very very computer illiterate? I just went through our AD and we have about... 37 shared accounts.
 I am lost on how to transition these users to using their own logins due to how many people can use a single station - I'm most stuck on users not knowing how to switch accounts using the 'other accounts' option on the Windows logon screen.
 I've been at this new place for about 3 months, and while I am working on transitioning to running the department myself (currently just me and my boss who's transitioning to another field), my main goal during this first year is to clean things up and implement best practices. 
 Part of me wants to ask if there's ever any situation where shared accounts are okay, but at the end of the day there's 0 accountability if something happens on one of these computers.
 How do you guys handle these? KIOSK mode? Print out instructions at workstations on switching accounts?

One of the first things I noticed was that some of our locations had a firewall, while some of them did not. I got a firewall installed and site to site VPN set up at all our locations. Recently I became aware that some of our sites have a wireless network for tenants to use though the site's ISP. My first reaction is to remove all ISP wireless and setup a managed wireless infrastructure at each location.
 Am I overacting by adding firewalls with site to site VPN at all our locations and wanting to have all wireless networks at our locations be managed and using the same equipment that we use on our corporate wireless? Any idea of why they would not use firewalls at all locations? How would you handle the tenant wireless infrastructure?
 I am a team of 1 at my company and the person I took over for was not a technical person.

 We are having an issue where someone from, for example, 'john@superawesomeclient.com' sends an email to a distribution list, for example 'groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za' which I and a few others on 'myowndomain.com' (hosted on microsoft 365) are a member of, we wont get that message but john@superawesomeclient.com will get a NDR it will have this
  
Error DetailsError:550 5.7.360 Remote server returned message denied by administrative policy -> 550 Administrative prohibition - envelope blocked - https://community.mimecast.com/docs/DOC-1369#550 [ZgnzmELwMCC9bjqMvfWALQ.za9]Message rejected by:za-smtp-1.mimecast.co.za
  
Now other people on 'superawesomeclient.com' and 'fantasticclient.co.za' domains can send emails to me and others in my domain I get them no problem, but its is emails from 'groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za' is where my issue lays.
 Both the mentioned domains are on my 'allowed list', and I have both of those domains setup to bypass the built-in spam filters. I have even set the all the Mimecast server ip's (for South Africa that is) in my 'IP Allow list' from on our 'Connection filter Policy', but still emails from just the one account (groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za) by anyone on my domain (myowndomain.com).
 ​
 How can I go about resolving this and what would I need to show the people at 'fantasticclient.co.za' and their domain is 'whitelisted' so to speak if this is their issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some help commenting, analyzing, and criticizing different queuing models for some IoT interactions.
 ​
 Using the simulator MobileJINQS with support of the ON/OFF model, assuming that each ON/OFF model represented a mobile sender that uses various QoS settings for the transmission of messages and followed 4 experiments:
 ​
  
ON/OFF Model
  
* The server remains in the ON and OFF states for exponentially distributed time periods T_ON = T_OFF = 20 / 40 / 60s;
 * Messages get processed with a mean service demand D=0.125s
 * Messages arrive to the queue with a mean rate lambda varying from 0.05 to 4 messages/sec.
 This is the simulated curve of the mean response time for several lambda rates:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/GFtW39M.png
 ​
  
ON/OFF Model with QoS Features
  
* T_ON=T_OFF=20s
 * Mean service demand D=0.125s
 * Message arrival rate lambda varies from 0.05 to 3.9 messages/sec.
 ​
 On that basis, we had four experiments on, considering these QoS features:
 (1) Tau = 1, lifetime = infinity, and K = infinity
 (2) Tau = 1, lifetime = 30s, and K = infinity
 (3) Tau = 0.75, lifetime = infinity, and K = infinity
 (4) Tau = 1, lifetime = infinity, and K = 100
 ​
 For each of the four experiments, the ON/OFF model was run 10 times and we got the following curve, response time with respect to arrival rate lambda:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/lo3SaXP.png
 ​
 As well as sucess rate with respect to arrival rate:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/qF35p07.png
 ​
  
Nonpreemptive priority and multiclass simulation model
  
​
 K classes were defined with different arrival lambda_k and service rates mu_k for each class.
 ​
 Depending on the values of lambda_k and mu_k, the system can be saturated.
 ​
 Let p be the server utilization. The queue remains unsaturated when p < 1.
 ​
 We got the curvers of different server utilization, first one was p=0.69 and classes C=19; and second was p=0.89 and classes C=9
 ​

 It would not be practical for the users to have to call the help desk every time they need to access something via password and, if they have a known password always available to them, it defeats some of the security of using a smart card since the smart card authentication can be bypassed if the password is compromised.
 What are you doing to give SCRIL users password access for onboarding and to authenticate to resources that don’t recognize smart cards?

 Doesn’t key trust have better RDP compatibility and also allows you to use “run as” where you cannot with cloud trust?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have more than 10 office users using chrome on a daily basis.
 Two days ago some of them notified me that the print preview takes literally ages to load. I stayed after work to check and it not only takes more than two minutes to load but it also crashes chrome 1/3 times.
 I scraped the internet for a solution and tried a bunch of stuff and ended up fixing it by manually installing new Post script drivers on all 10 machines for all 3 office printers.
 The preview now works without crashing Chrome but it still takes about 5 seconds to load (a big improvement over the 2 minutes it used to take). Naturally everyone is still complaining because according to them it used to be instantaneous before.
 Im all out of ideas here so any tips would be really appreciated. One option is obviously to just use another browser but it’s an unpopular option as “they’re all really used to chrome and how it looks”
 Pls help.

 And I have been noticing when I push the system to do heavy tasks that the CPU performance at 90% CPU load across all threads hovers around 3.45Ghz, I never see it hit 3.60Ghz or its boost of 3.90Ghz. 
 The bios settings are set to default, Speedstep and TurboBoost are enabled and the bios is on the latest version. 
 I wonder if its a Dell thing or a Microsoft Windows 11 thing?

 Looking to see what you folks use for RFX management? i.e. we are issuing an RFP so we don't really need help creating the RFP itself (but that would be nice!) but we do need a portal where vendors could leave their responses and questions related to the RFP could be answered. Ideally we want to host this ourselves.

 I was thinking we could use NextCloud but wondering if there were better options? X-posted to selfhosted.

 They are done both of important data inside and of the entire VMs with veeam.
 But I just want daily snapshots to have bit of extra automated "backup" when I am updating stuff inside, knowing I can do so without extra step of doing snapshot beforehand. Which is easier and faster to revert to than backups.

If i rightclick the file it show the info box "this file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer".
 So far so good. If i click on allow and therefore remove the Zone Identifier the File opens with a double click. 
 I checked other file types aswell. The same Problem with word files, and image files. So its not a application problem. It seems to be a windows problem.
 If i change the internetoptions-> security -> Internet Zone -> Start unsecure applications and files : from confirm (recommended) -> to activate (not secure) the problem is gone also. But i dont like to change this setting.
 What could cause this problem? Can you help me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the 2012R deadline approaching I upgraded everything to 2022, and rebuilt out DC's in the process. I was ready to decommission the final 2012R2 DC but when testing via a shutdown, I experienced an outage. 
 Our intranet, hosted on Google Cloud on Ubuntu, requires a sign in with an active directory credential to access (email address + password via LDAP). Despite changing the IP of the VM's DNS server to match our new DC's (one on GCP and one on prem), the moment I turn off the old DC is the moment authentication on this server fails, and staff instead get an "Internal Server Error" page from apache. 
 Digging into the apache config, I can see the authentication is using LDAP, with the following section;
 ## Active Directory AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthLdapBindDN readonly@int.domain.net AuthLdapBindPassword AuthLdapBindURL ldap://int.domain.net:3268/?userPrincipleName?sub 
 Three things about this;
 1 - Even though the AD account it's using to authenticate has the absolute minimum access, I don't like how the password is stored in plain text. Is this a requirement for such a setup?
 2 - What configures that ldap:// and how do I get it to point to the new DC's? Is this configured vía our public DNS instead? Or is not DNS at all?? 
 3 - Doing some digging online I discovered that it's possible to "automatically authenticate" via their user account if the credentials match (meaning they don't have to enter them in). Is this only possible on Windows/will it break a manual username/password entry? We have some Macs around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some recent less than desirable experiences at my job, I reached out to a recruiter. They have passed along a job opportunity to be the IT Manager at a Non Profit for me to look at. I would be the sole IT person onsite and the description lists everything from on boarding new employees for training to writing and implementing policy. Apparently there is a significant level of vendors leveraged right now, but it still seems as though the job might be punching a bit above it's weight class in terms of expectations and salary. The network size is approximately 100 end user devices according to the recruiter (computers). 
 What are people's experiences working in an environment like this? Is there a chance it could be good? Or will it be an extremely overworked shit show? 
 I will also add I have previously been a network admin and systems engineer and feel as though my only weak point skillset wise will be the HIPPA stuff. I do have experience working in a heavily controlled and audited environment so I think it will be more so based around learning the new intricacies VS entirely new concepts. In the listing they specifically call out that they will send people to training to ensure their skillset stays sharp. 
 The salary is more than livable (85k) as it will be a great resume builder and it's similiar to my current role as an engineer. I wouldn't be taking a pay cut.

 User logs in, 802.1x auth occurs with user’s account (EXAMPLE\jdoe) and EX3400 dhcp process deletes the existing DHCP binding, resulting in Windows machine getting a new IP address.
 Desired behavior is no IP change.
 This only occurs when the machine is directly connected to the switch running dhcp-local-server. When machine is connected to an EX3400 switch trunked to the switch providing DHCP, this does not occur, as the DHCP process has no awareness of the auth change.
 Any ideas of how to get dhcp-local-server to ignore 802.1x auth events?

 Only problem is that I also didn't enable telnet or SSH...
 There's a reset button that doesnt appear to be able to wipe this thing back to factory settings, or it doesn't disclose the additional steps needed to do so in the docs.
 How are the 1k's able to beset if CLI is not an option? I'm not a hardcore network guy, I mostly deal with Meraki gear... so sorry if this is a dumb question

 It always makes me hesitant to apply for these companies.
 Anybody else get that feeling or am I just paranoid ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situation:
 ServerA <-> FW <- IPSec VPN -> FW (NAT) <==> public internet
 Issue: some clients have connection issues with ServerA , apparently only when sending larger files. The public IP address is NATted on the first firewall.
 When a Linux client enables mtu probing (echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mtu_probing ), there are no issues.
 So it is some kind of MTU issue. I ran a couple of ping tests from a client, and I am getting weird results:
 ​
  
 ping -s <size> <ip address> ping -D -s (size> <ip address> 
  
 64: OK 64: OK 
  1394: OK 1394: OK 
  1395: No ICMP reply 1395: NO ICMP reply 
  1396: No ICMP reply 1396: NO ICMP reply 
  1397: OK 1397: NO ICMP reply 
  1464: OK 1464: NO ICMP reply 
  1465: OK 1465: fragmentation needed (Code 4 reply) 
  1472: OK 1472: fragmentation needed (Code 4 reply) 
  1473: No ICMP reply 1473: message too long ( ping: sendto: Message too long ) ; probably from OS, don't see anything in Wireshark 
  1495: No ICMP reply (Wireshark: Fragmented IP protocol) 1495: message too long 
 
 When initiating a TCP connection to ServerA, serverA responds with a MSS of 1384 .
 Downloading a 10.000 bytes file from ServerA works as expected.
 Can any point me in the right direction where to look ? ServerA isn't in our control and is difficult to get any traces from. On the left FW there are no rules, it only terminates the VPN connection. The right side of the VPN and its FW is in our control and allows some tcp-ports and ICMP. MTU size of the interfaces on the FW are 1500.
 Especially the difference in behaviour around size 1397, where normal pings suddenly start working again until 1473. This differs per connection, on my normal home wifi I see above behaviour, when connecting to a 4G hotspot (either tethered or via wifi to a 4G router), there are no ICMP replies from 1395 onwards. And pings with DF-bit set never return the Code 4 reply, so that might be filtered in 4G networks.

 Best practices are certainly not being followed and I'm just now digging into how to get us to a good spot. I've recently enabled URL and Application monitoring for our lan to wan policy. App monitoring is requesting deep inspection, but it seems the impact of doing so must be considered.
 - Any advice for whether to enable deep inspection or not?
 - Should antivirus be enabled on our lan-to-wan policy with out-of-the-box defaults? What about DNS filter?
 - Can I setup alerts to fire when a "monitored" category URL is hit? Or can you only fire alerts on a blocked URL?
 What would be your recommendations if you had a "new" Fortigate firewall dropped in your lap? I'm willing to consider some of the subscriptions Fortinet offers, such as Forticloud/Fortianalyzer, if the value is there.
 The current goal is to increase visibility into user activity. We don't regularly monitor, but in the event we want to check on someone's activity, we want that ability. Right now I'm struggling to glean meaningful info from our App/URL monitoring and can't find a way to filter by categories (such as adult categories or suspicious/blocked URLs).
 I'm going to be taking this one step at a time, so any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone here work with an AT&T Service Provider along with their dedicated AT&T rep? I had one reach out to me recently and they gave me their spiel. Everything sounded like a lot of added value for no cost (since AT&T pays them directly). Is this too good to be true? Someone will help me manage all my AT&T woes and I don't have to pay a penny? What are the pros/cons? Interested to hear your experience.
 Edit: an AT&T Solutions Provider (not Service, my mistake) is different than AT&T itself. This is someone who works as a middle man between you and AT&T. It’s like they know AT&T is such a PITA to work with and they help you navigate that. Anyone have experience with that? I know AT&T is horrible to work with. Trust me, I know! That’s why I’m wondering if this service would be worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/networking
 I'm working with a client that's exploring options for SASE and SDWAN for around 200 branch sites. They don't run redundant internet circuits at the majority of these sites, so I have steered them away from expensive SDWAN solutions to accompany their SASE purchase; I don't see any value in branch SDWAN appliances if they are single-circuit for the foreseeable future.
 My question is: has anyone out there found a relatively low cost, IPSec capable, cloud-managed router with some level of enterprise support available? A good low touch provisioning workflow would be a big bonus as well. These devices would strictly be used to feed traffic from branch sites into the selected SASE solution via IPSec tunnel. We would either do a static default on the branch routers, or distribute a default via an IGP. The SASE solution will double as their WAN in this case, for branch-to-branch connectivity.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since COVID and the new hybrid workplace, I've seen a lot of turnover in many enterprises.
 Often times, senior network engineers move on and are replaced with junior engineers who lack experience and foundational knowledge. Other times, senior engineers are replaced with new senior engineers who have the background knowledge, but need to learn the company-specific implementations. 
 I'm looking for ideas on how to skill-up these new hires, and wondering what others feel are some of the best methods? 
 A few things I've found to work:
 Shadowing/Co-Piloting changes - Junior shadows the senior on a change, then junior takes the wheel and senior co-pilots the change. This is sort of like the "I do/we do/you do" concept in education.
 Good documentation/topologies/reference materials - Having plans of the network topology, where to find things, etc.
 Leveraging TAC - Pass off issues that require the involvement of TAC can help learn basic troubleshooting commands
 Trial by fire - Throw to the wolves on resolving tickets, etc. Basically sink or swim.
 ​
 ​
 Does your organization do anything special to ramp up new hires? For example, a Wiki or handbook or something that goes over all the different equipment you use with reference configs and topologies? Do you put new engineers through 3rd party training?
 Or do you mostly rely on their previous experience and expect on-the-job training to cover the rest?

 The current network set up is so basic that I think my parents home is better set up and I decided it all needs to go together with our current network supplier. It's just a basic network with no VLAN's and WPA2 Pers. WiFI authentication. All of this is running on Meraki. My Warehouses are equipped with nothing else than stock ISP modem/router. As a company were fully cloud based (no onprem servers). We use Microsoft 365, AWS and Oracle services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been helpdesk, junior admin, programmer, and ERP guru for a year here (ERP for 5+ years) in a one man IT department with 100 users. I have a MSP help me with the servers, backups, patching and networking. 
 I get lots of different projects thrown at me and I’m feeling overwhelmed but I want to grow my career. 
 I’ve written two applications that the company uses daily and made our business flow much faster. I’ve implemented a ticketing system, enrolled field user devices with inTune, working on migrating our ERP to be cloud based, fully took over helpdesk, comfortable with Active Directory and GPOs, set them up with SharePoint, on-boarded all devices with defender ATP, and more. 
 Now they know that I can program pre chatGPT, they want me to make these other complicated business applications. All while I’m trying to earn my admin title.
 Not sure what to focus on and I’ve mentioned that IT admin and programmer are two full time jobs. I prefer sys admin over programming any day. 
 I can probably cruise here and learn a lot on the sys admin side but I’m by myself and feel like an imposter when talking to the MSP some days. 
 Anyone else in a similar boat? Is one year experience enough to apply elsewhere? Do I keep on keeping on and rely on MSP if I’m an idiot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a little off topic but hopefully some folks here have worked in hardware or done their own home labs before:
 I am being offered some retired server equipment (that I very much want!) and a half-height mobile server rack/cart thing. Any advice on the best way to transport it? 
 The server rack cart will fit in my SUV if it's on its side, but that's only reasonable if it's empty. The server equipment (including a nice rack-mount UPS) is quite heavy and will fill the cart, I don't imagine that could reasonably be lifted even with 4 people (and probably not ideal to have that stuff laying on its side?).
 I have a trailer with a ramp I could borrow, but the trailer has like a whopping 2 leaf-springs of suspension so anything in there would be bounced and rattled like crazy for my 1-hour drive home over shitty roads.
 I can borrow a pickup truck, but how to get the loaded cart up into the truck? (There is no lift onsite, I have a tractor at home and could easily unload it, but getting it into the truck is a challenge). 
 Short of renting a UHaul, any ideas? Thanks in advance!

 Long time lurker, first time asking for some help.
 Our company has started offering customers SAML as a login method recently. Naturally I was tasked with setting it up customers, because I have a lot of spare time as the only IT Admin for a company of 250 users. /s
 We (Service Provider) use Okta, customers vary between Google Workspace, Okta, Azure AD for IdP. I've got no issue setting up Okta or Google Workspace customers, I use those daily, got 'em covered, but Azure is where I am struggling. I figured out how to set up a SAML app, and it's working with a SP initiated flow, but user attributes aren't mapping which long term will cause issues. All I get is their email, but also need to get firstName and lastName to map.
 If anyone could direct me on how to properly map attributes from Azure AD to Okta via SAML it would be greatly appreciated!
 ​
 On a side note, I am creating documentation on how to set everything up on both our and customer side and got approval from my manager and the CSM manager that once documentation is ready, this will become CSM responsibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone!
 I was doing some research on IT companies in my local area and came across a job at a company called Unisys. The pay for the work seems very good, requires traveling to customers to repair computer hardware and troubleshoot primarily Dell computers at ~$24/hr plus mileage. The majority of the support appears to be based out of Asia, but the position requires work local to where I live. 
 I've seen mixed reviews online with people saying that it is an MSP company, and it should not be worked with while others say that it is good pay and experience with hard work. I currently make $18/hr full time, but I am looking to branch into the field of IT. This seems like a good opportunity for me, but I need some 2nd opinions. 
 Has anyone here worked with Unisys in the past? If so, what was your experience like working for them? Would you recommend them?

 Obviously
 "no vlan"

 The new office will connect by Wireless WAN to the main office WiFi network and have their own LAN and wifi there(separate business). There will be just a couple of workstations, two printers and mobile phones.
 ​
 I assume these routers should have two WiFi adapters in order to accommodate two different WiFI tasks? Is anything else I need to be aware of? Also if you have models to suggest that would be highly appreciated.

 Is there anything that can check against a constantly updated database of compromised passwords (and is also easy to deploy) without the administrator having to download a huge file of hashes every time to update it?
 This is for on-prem AD obvsiouly. We are also putting into place Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server as well, but in my testing, I've noticed some passwords it would accept that Netwrix found in the compromised database, so would still like something that can do a check against leaked passwords.
 Thanks!

 If this isn’t an appropriate question for this sub - sorry.
 Recently I was tasked to create a registry for gear such as keyboards, desktop docks, and perhaps even ergo mouse pads due to the fact that many of these items tend to walk away. The issue is that these stationary items are at desks in a hybrid environment where the employees book their desk on a week by week basis. Normally I would just have everyone sign for their issue. But that’s not feasible with this work arrangement. 
 Not really sure what to do to make users accountable in this environment. 
 Any recommendations?

 I'm not sure if this is the most accurate sub to post this on but I couldn't really find an active sub that was more closely related. 
 At my work, I need to create (with the help of a few others) a range of computers to test cyber threat emulation and defense on. The budget for this range is exactly $0 and we have to just use a bunch of old laptops we have lying around. This kind of throws virtualizing all of the devices out as an option. Currently, we plan to run the exploits which will infect all of the laptops and then manually re-install Windows on each one, this is super time-consuming so I'm trying to think of how we can do this in a more automated way.
 I've never done anything like this before and it is also way outside of the scope of my job but it's gotta get done. Some thoughts I've had is having a virtual machine on top of the host machine that we create a snapshot of and somehow make the connection within the network only reach the VM rather than the host machine.
 Does anyone have any advice or can point me in the right direction for how I can get started with this?

 It had an option called other user. So I logged into my admin and reset it.
  
 But the question is
  
How do I make this available for all machines?
 Does it have to be set locally or when I set them up?
 Currently we have an admin account on the machine, but obviously it had been wiped by the senior user
 Would this other user option give us the way to remove the old style admin account?
  
Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As most of us know - or will get to know soon enough, unlocking security features with some software vendors, are usually locked behind extremely high price tags.
 As per default, if you want to add a piece of software, and want to be compliant with just the basic GDPR or ISAE on security, the "enterprise"-license is the only way forward.
 With cyberattacks being one of the largest threats to organizations, should these features not by law, be included in even the smallest level of licensing?
 I manage quite a few licenses for a medium size company, and everyone who have tried to enlighten management about why we should pay for the Porche instead of the Fiat (no flame), knows how hard you sometimes have to fight and fail for that. Even given the possible security risks it entails.
 What are your thoughts on the subject, in terms of making it a law instead of a moneysink? Would it be possible? What would be the argument for it not happening? What would be the punchline that sold it?

 What's the best way to make this happen automatically? I'm open to using Teams, Outlook add-ins, excel macro, Power Automate flows, or bots - whatever works best. 
 Also, I want to keep track of who's voted and share the results in an Excel file. Any suggestions on how to make that happen?
 Some of the methods i tried were using voting bots in MS Teams, but haven't found any which meets my needs: - export results to file so we can add orders to same files and keep track of money flow.
 I also tried creating re-occurring flow in which MS Teams connected with MS Forms file, but that proven to be impossible for me.
 Thanks for your help, and looking forward to your suggestions!

I have been doing thing myself and have taken maybe 3 calls in the last 6 months, but Im not about to ask other techs todo this so I want to pay them and add it to their contract.
 I was thinking a lower flat rate and then a higher rate per call. What would be a fair $ amount for the flat rate and then higher rate per call in the industry in the moment?

 I'm 8 years on the networking field at a European service provider, I gain quite a lot of experience during this time, did CCNP, CCNA Security, JNCIA, Silver Peak certifications and now working with Juniper's CSO and SSR SD-WAN solutions. 
 To be honest in the last 3 years I didn't became a fan of SDWAN nor did I got interested in the Cloud Solutions. Lately I have some free time and I would like to learn new things and do some certifications, but I'm not sure which way to go. 
 From one side I'm planning to do a Linux certification: I have general knowledge I picked up during my work, but it would be nice to have a more in-depth understanding in the system. I think it's still the foundation of IT. Which certification would you recommend? CompTIA or LPI?
 From the networking side, first I was thinking going for a Cisco or Juniper certification, but then I found Wireshark exam. Every now and then we hit problems where packet analysis is necessary and I only have basic knowledge in that, but once the data is gathered by others it's fun to solve the issue by completely understanding the traffic behavior. 
 So I did check this WCNA certification, but to be honest it feels a bit like an abandoned exam. The books are outdated and their website as well. What is your opinion on WCNA?

 I have been trying to find if this is a teams issue since yesterday,
 To make sure this issue doesn't happen, I told the user to stay In another call for an hour, she did and it worked.
 Fast forward 30 mins, user is in a meeting and other users cannot hear what the user says. 
 Entire office is saying its the network speed, but after testing there's enough of bandwidth too. Have anyone encountered this issue before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 We have been having some issues lately with outlook losing connection for some people in the company. It just sometimes loses connection randomly, and it's not really something people notice right away, so sometimes an e-mail will just be stuck for a whole day. So a lot of people have swapped to browser since the issue does not seem to appear there.
 Some more info on the issue.
 There can be days between occurrence
 It seems the only way to fix this is restarting the pc.
 Multiple people are impacted (Two guys with completely new workstations)
 ​
 I've tried all the common fixes.
 Check Connectivity and Mailbox Server Status. The first thing to do is check your system's network status.
 Check Work Offline Status.
 Restart Outlook in Safe Mode
 Fix Certificate Issue
 Create New Outlook Profile.
 Rebuild Outlook Data File.
 ​
 I've been going through a SaRA Advanced Diagnostic file and found this event log. I was thinking the credentials being rejected might be causing some of the issues.
 The BITS service provided job credentials in response to the UNIDENTIFIED authentication challenge from the Outlook.office365.com server for the microsoft Outlook offline address book xxxxxxxxxxxx transfer job that is associated with the following URL:/OAB/xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/oab.xml. The credentials for the S-1-5-21-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx user were rejected.
 ​
 If anyone has had this issue before, or might know a fix. Please guide me. All help is appreciated.
 ​
 Cheers guys

 On the client - the non AAD Joined machine - by selecting "use web account" I can rdp into the AAD Joined machine as expected. 
 The first connection goes great. I am prompted to enter my Microsoft account, password, and complete a number matching MFA request. However, all subsequent connections over rdp are just allowed and signed in automatically.
 Is there a proper way to enforce this authentication and mfa requirement everytime from the server (AAD Joined device) side?

I am working on turning it into a truenas box but keep running into an issue. I want to add a dual 10g nic and 8 port sata card in the spare ports on the riser card. My issue is that they are not being recognized. The lights come on but they are not seen in bios or truenas. There was already a sata card installed in one of the ports that work but adding anything new does not seem to work. That card was already there. I am new to riser cards and unsure what to do next. Below are some troubleshooting steps I have taken.
  
Swap in the new sata card into the working port..... guess what... it works.... so I know that slot accepts anything. The other slots do not work on that riser card.
 
Reset bios... nothing changed. The other riser card is not accepting anything. Still just that 1 slot on that 1 riser card.
 
Enabled and disabled almost everything in bios. It never sees the new card on any of the other slots on that riser card or the other riser card. Just that one slot on that one riser card.
 
 Thank you for any help... I want this to replace my current usb hard drives asap...
 Edit 1: in the bios it talks about 2a and 2c being enabled. I turned them to disabled and the intel raid card stopped working.

 The first part is a com port. It needs vcp enabled. The second part is a usb device. The driver for this device is not on the internet and is installed from a directory.
 The problem occurs when windows update updates the system. The com port disappears and the gate program fails to connect. The only way to fix it when it gets like this is to uninstall and reinstall the driver.
 I've tried disabling driver updates but that doesn't seem to fix the problem. I'm not sure why but windows update seems to be poking around with devices in a way that breaks the system.

 I've been at a MSP for about 4 years now and I over see most of network infrastructure for clients. I came from a large enterprise that was a Cisco shop, since I was pretty new when I worked at this larger corporation I never got into the weeds of ISE. Now being in the industry for some years know I wanted to see if anyone had thoughts on learning Cisco's ISE platform. 
 I have a cluster of R620's in my lab and I decided to spin up a ISE VM and connect it to my GNS3 lab, so all the setup of ISE makes sense to me connecting to a AAA server, utilizing 802.1x. I just wanted to get some opinions on if its really worth it to learn this platform, currently none of my MSP's clients use this however long term I'm looking to do network administration for a hospital. It seems (from my view) that its more beneficial to learn ISE if you utilize it but its not worth learning like other core concepts like CCNA, AWS etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I utilize python for syncing data across applications, reporting, automations, even basic web apps for dashboards and user inputs. It's always impressing management and has likely saved our org hundreds if not thousands of hours of menial labor. 
 However, most my day is spent in admin menus or configuring applications, servers, networking, and endpoints. I have no formal computer science degree and am not a professional coder. I know for a fact if I ever turn over my documentation and git repo to an actual pyton developer they'd laugh me out of the room.
 Should I be putting more effort in to these skills? Or is amature-level scripting to be expected in small business IT?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says I have a set of workstations at work with an unusual setup. These workstations are a 911 dispatch center and each station consists of 3 separate PCs, 5 monitors (2 PCs with 2 each nad the 3rd with just 1 monitor), all connected together with a type of KVM switch that allows users to control each machine with just one keyboard and mouse and have the desktops act as if they are all on one machine.
 The KVM device is called an Adder CCS controller and the way it functions is each machine is connected to this controller via USB and the kb/mouse connect to it. The controller allows you to move the mouse from one screen to another but in doing so switches the input of both kb & mouse to the corresponding PC. The reason why we have this odd setup instead of just consolidating the functions to one PC is that we do not own two of the PCs as they are provided by external entities to be used with their specific software product.
 This all works perfectly fine on 3 of the 4 stations but the 4th has had literally everything replaced and it continued to cause the mouse to randomly jump around, the browser windows to refresh or close and lose any info that had bene typed in, and other odd ball issues. Currently we have it setup where the one PC that had the odd issues completely separated from the controller and other systems but this is not ideal as it requires the use of two sets of kb/mouse.
 Has anyone used a setup like this before and if so do you have a recommendation for a replacement product? A traditional KVM or USB splitter is not an option as they cannot rely on needing to use a button to switch inputs, nor is a USB hub as they need the kb/mouse to only function on one screen at a time.
 So far the only thing I have been able to find is software products but we would prefer not to use that and stick with a hardware physical connection.

 Looking for some clarification on ISAKMP. If it's used as a framework to establish SAs upon, then how does IKE Phase 2 establish IPsec SAs without using ISAKMP? As I understand ISAKMP, it's only used in establishment of Phase 1's SAs. 5 days of endless research on this proved fruitless. Hoping someone can save the day here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a small company that provide CCTV systems to customers. We are currently in the process of upgrading our systems and I have been tasked with finding a way to setup our IP cameras on a VLAN using a "router behind a router". The equipment I have to work with is an IP camera (HikVision), a Ruijie router, connected to the office router and a Ruijie switch. The setup we currently have goes:
 Office router -> Ruijie router -> Ruijie POE switch -> IP camera
 What we are trying to do is set the camera up so that the office router could be on a network for example 192.168.1.1
 and the camera could be setup on 192.168.2.1 but still connect to the internet as it requires internet to be viewed remotely. I have managed to set this up fairly easily however, we also want to possibly avoid any rogue connections being able to access the office network if they managed to break onto the "cameras network". I am not entirely sure if this is possible as obviously the camera needs to access the internet. Right now, when connected to the Vlan that the camera is on (192.168.55.1), I am still able to access everything on the office network (192.168.1.1). Is there a way to avoid this?
 We also are trying to see if there is a way to access the camera wirelessly through being connected to the office network, however, again, I feel this may not be possible as right now, I need to be connected directly to the Ruijie router through ethernet to access the camera.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 We asked for ASOP(?) Drawings from the contractors that will be running cables but I don't feel like that's enough.
 Our standard naming is Site-closet id-(a-z)-(1-48)
 This is pretty simple to find in the closet, but horrible to find in the field.
 I've considered room names in a drop, but that can change. As time goes on, and more runs go in for more devices, we'll find a drop A-12 raise C-48.
 I was hoping to learn if anyone here has a program that we can load up drawings and update this information of where drops are. Pin point high or walls etc..
 It sure would beat a spreadsheet that needs to be update and is then forgotten about in a year's time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've switches HP/H3C A5800 and lot of of OEM SFP modules. If module is coded as "common / general", works in my switches. So, the line lights up, the data flows through., but in console is message:
  
This is not a supported transceiver for this platform. HPE does not guarantee the normal operation or maintenance of unsupported transceivers. Please review the platform datasheet on the HPE web site or contact your HPE sales rep for a list of supported transceivers.
  
And not work DDM and is not possible to read manufacturer information (S/N and date code).
 I've some generic code, with which module works better. Works DDM, but in manufacturer info is a "generic" serial number and date code. I have found the following about the code:
 Block A0h:
  
in bytes 60h - 62h is string "H3C"
 bytes 63h - 74h are set to 00h
 in bytes 75h - 7Fh are some hexacodes, I don't know their meaning.
  
In block A2h in page 02h is H3C (HP?) specific code:
  
bytes 80h - 93h is serial number (ASCII)
 bytes 94h, 95h are set to 00h
 bytes 96h - 9Dh is date code (ASCII)
 bytes 9Eh - FFh are a mystery to me
  
Small problem is that serial number and date code are at two positions. At standard positions in A0h block and at H3C (HP) specific positions in A2h block, page 02. If I insert module to "generic" switch, informations from A0h block are read. If I insert module to H3C/HP switch, i get informations from A2h block. If I change serial number and/or date code in A2h block, H3C/HP switch don't identify module as HP compatible any moreSomewhere is some checksum / hash.
 My question is - know anyone exact structure of data in A0h block at addresses 60h - 7Fh and in block A2h (page 02h) at addresses 80h - FFh? Is there a SFP module code with another structure that will work in switch HP/H3C A5800?
 Thanks,
 Zbynek

 I inherited an OpenGear device that has an active LTE card in it. It is currently at a remote site with no technical hands. The site topology is shown in the above screenshot. I have not previously configured or deployed these devices.
 The OpenGear device is attached to a random port on the site's core switch (a Cisco 2960X). The switch has no dynamic or static routes configured, just a default gateway upstream to the FortiGate.
 This site regularly has outages with its current ISP. I was wondering if it is possible in these failure scenarios to route internet traffic out the OpenGear device's LTE connection automatically?
 The other potential rub - according to the OpenGear device, the SIM card is using a "private" public IP, meaning a VPN tunnel is required to access it.
 Thanks, in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a newbie question here. Sorry if this is a too simple question for this forum.
 I get data packets
  
Have a header and payload and trailer 
 Header has routing information (source/destination IP address, type, number)
 Payload is the actual Data
 Trailiure is vary between protocols but is generally used for (Cyclic) Redundancy Checks (CRC)
 
 The data packets are all given a number before they are sent.
 The computer uses these numbers to put the information back together in the right order (they can travel different routes over the internet and arise out of sequence.)
  
I also get protocols are a set of rules and various places talk about them being a set of rules governing how information travels across the internet but is it not really the packets that do this? Are protocols maybe more about defining the data packets and how they are used/unpacked?
 I am trying to understand this at a high level to teach computing at a secondary school. I worked in IT for many years and have never had to understand the details of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We currently have a Meraki firewall and while its a big step up from where we were it does lack specific feature sets. 
 When looking for our next firewall I'd like to have a feature where I can assign specific VLANs to different groups of VPN users. For instance, when internal sales team members remotely connect they are assigned an IP address from VLAN 666 and when accounting team members remotely connect they are assigned an IP address from VLAN 123. 
 If I were looking for devices that can do this, what is the name of the feature would I be looking for? Is it something that firewalls do or is this more along the lines of a needing a dedicated device, like a VPN concentrator?
 Finally, as this is still in the planning phase, are there any VPN-as-a-service offerings that can do this?
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting last week (March 27, 2023), we saw a giant uptick in our phishing test failure rates. 300 person company that typically gets a single failure a month and we got probably a dozen in 3-4 days. When talking to the users, we're finding that they're not clicking on anything in the emails, but still failing the click through test. If it was just a handful, we'd say "users be users", but they swear up and down they're not, and when we look in KnowBe4, the logged IP isn't from our range and shows as owned by MS. We're starting to wonder if the MS anti-spam is testing out the links differently than before which is causing the failures. Anyone else seeing similar or have any thoughts?

We currently have the PC's directly patched into a cisco router which is running a EZVPN connection from a Cisco ASA we have specifically for this. We like this setup because the PC is always connected to the states network not needing to use a remote client software like any connect. 
 The problem is these routers are going EOL soon and we would like a more cost efficient solution vs buying more routers that serve just this one purpose. Any ideas how we can go about a different solution? Should we move back to a AnyConnect profile and just tell the users they have to log into every time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just had my umpteenth meeting about the above topic. There's a view among the exec team that having someone manually go through the shared drives for each department would be too time-consuming and that there's a technological approach that would eliminate most of the grunt work by automatically categorising the various files (i.e. by identifying PII content, for example).
 I know there are tools that can do this - we've looked at them in the past - but my take is that the grunt work still needs to be done. All you've really done is come up with a way to prioritise what you look at first.
 - someone needs to check the files that are identified as PII to confirm that they contain PII.
 - someone needs to check the files that haven't been identified as PII to confirm that they don't contain PII.
 In both cases someone needs to decide whether or not the files need to be kept, or if they need to be deleted in line with data retention policies.
 Am I thinking about this the wrong way? Is there an approach that I'm not considering?

 Basically what's going on is when exporting prefixes that exist already in my BGP table to a target VRF and giving it a new extcommunity , for whatever reason not all the prefixes are getting the community that they've been specified for. I'm using "send-community additive" in the route-map
 ...jist of config looks like this;
 ip prefix-list yy_TO_xx
 seq 5 permit 10.59.10.0/24
 seq 10 permit 10.69.10.0/24
 etc
 Route-map yy_TO_xx_RT
 match ip address prefix-list yy_TO_xx
 set extcommunity RT::11111:2100 additive
 ​
 ** the first prefix gets the community but the second one doesn't. Each prefix already has an existing standard community & excommunity, per my bgp table
 The prefixes that aren't getting the additive community aren't getting leaked into the target vrf
 ​
 Would appreciate some insight as to what the issue might be , from your experiences with BGP communities and vrf leaking .

 How can dev upload files from "someuser123" via ftp\sftp without manually change then for www-data user ?
 Make user root ?
 Run web-server\php-manager\ets from "someuser123" ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, sorry if this is a stupid question. I've been thrown into this by my ankles and I'm having to learn a lot really fast so I'm making mistakes left and right.
 I'm trying to get an SNMP walk of a Juniper firewall. I know that in order for your SNMP walks to "resolve" the OIDs (ie, say "SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0" instead of "iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0"), you need to give SNMPWALK.exe a set of MIBs. So, fine, I got a bunch and then supplemented that with the Juniper MIBs I could find from LibreNMS's GitHub.
 After doing that the 1.3.6.1.2.1 OIDs resolve, but the enterprise OIDs (1.3.6.1.4.1) still don't -- I see this:
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.8.5.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.12.2.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 The SNMPWALK command I'm using is:
 snmpwalk -M "C:\MIBs" -v2c -c myjunipercommunitystring the.firewall.ip.address "1"
 Any insight on this would be hugely appreciated. I understand this might be an odd question; please don't ask why I'm trying to do this when there are better tools available.
 This is, unfortunately, how I need to do it.

 I see we do not have any expiration time set in sharepoint settings, but users are claiming they have to keep regenerating links because clients are getting "This link has expired" after X amount of days (they don't know the exact timeframe)
 Any ideas on how I can make expiration less links for our userbase without having to set up guest access for these external clients?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody. I took over a very small company where I need to setup all PCs and accounts from scratch, since the existing setup is horrible.
 The situation: I have 5 work stations that are shared by many employees. They do not need own users, just an "employee" user to access office and the NAS, because they are in general not doing typical office work. So no individual mails, onedrive, teams, etc necessary. 
 If you could create this from scratch how would you do it?
 I thought about getting 5 win11 pro licenses and 5 device licences for office 2021 and then create the same local users (Admin and employee) on every device. Could I also create those users in Azure ad and manage them there, so I do not have to create the users on each device individually? How can I setup the printers for everybody without doing this manually on every pc? What is needed and are there any monthly costs to expect?
 Looking forward to hear from your experiences and recommendations!

 I'm provisioning AD users via an Enterprise application. All users are provisioning correctly except one.
 At the begining there was an illegal character in the street field : (...\r\n Road ...) with error : 
 Scim/Users/CreateUser - BadRequest 400: Values can only contain alphanumeric characters and the following special characters .,+&-%－|[]~?!#()/'@:;_ , Username: <username>
 ​
 After this error log, I fixed the street field and the user synced with Azure AD. 
 ​
 But the issue persist : 
 I tried by clicking “Restart provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I also tried by clicking “Stop provisioning” and then click “start provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I also tried by clicking “Stop provisioning” and then click “Restart provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I tried “provision on demand” by adding the specific user but it keep failing.
 I also tried to remove the group which the user was in from provisioning.
 Error code
 SystemForCrossDomainIdentityManagementServiceIncompatible
 Error message
 UpdateForUnconnectedEntry
 ​
 Anyone got this issue ? If yes, did you manage to provision your user ? 
 Also sorry for bad english.

 I'm currently working with MDT to create a new Windows 10 deployment for a client of us. They use multiple Lenovo laptop types, T14, X250, x1, P15, etc and are using an offline media tool (USB). For some reason im unable to deploy the associated drivers per laptop type via de Task sequence. I've given up to try and deploy them during the task sequence via the official way.
 ​
 I've now created a script to manually run after the deployment from the USB where it will install all the drivers. I've created multiple "driver" folders per laptop type, the script is located in each laptop type folder so it will only install the right drivers.
 ​
 Im now looking into a script to check the %make%\%model% and run the associated laptop type script. Say i'm deploying the task sequence on a Lenovo T14, and the script in that specific laptop type folder is called DriversT14.bat. Could anyone help me with the creation of this script?

 Folder structure: USB>Drivers>T14>(driver folders + script.bat)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a fun situation, we lease a facility with multiple companies and a shared utility area that contains the network ingress. When we moved in we installed a small wall mount enclosure with a lock for our equipment in that room. It is well marked that it is our property.
 About two year ago we found somebody popped the lock and installed their own equipment in our cabinet. We rose hell with the landlord and got it removed.
 Fast forward a couple month the same thing happened and we suspected it was the carrier tech but couldn't prove it. Since we are closest to the room our business lead on-site is often asked to allow service people in the room and we inform him under no condition should any carriers ever be given non-escorted access.
 A few weeks later we get a call that a carrier tech showed up unannounced on a Friday afternoon. He was informed we would be happy to schedule to have him return on Monday to be a good neighbor but if they couldn't escort him we didn't have time. They tech was pissed.
 When he returned the next week he still wasn't happy. Now we are in a small market so there are not a lot of local techs so we will run into him over and over....he doesn't provide service with a smile.
 Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and we have power outage and telecom issues. We arrive at the facility and find someone popped our lock again and unplugged the fiber from just our equipment (none of our neighbors).
 Before this incident the landlord refused to allow us to put our own surveillance on this common space. After explaining to him we would hold his company liable for any business losses due to their negligence to secure our equipment in a shared space we finally have a camera installed. I'm low key hoping the person who has been doing this is the person we think--we will have video evidence this time to take action.
 I hate having shared equipment closets of any type.

 Edit: CloudFlare Radar has picked it up: https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1643070260130504704?s=20
 Edit 2: Apparently it's an issue with their BGP prefix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've got a weird issue with random POE failure on one of my Meraki 120-48FP switches. 
 The switch specs state that it can provide 740 W of usage, and I've got several POE Polycom phones connected to it. Each phone draws about 3W, though each advertises to the switch that it needs up to 7W.
 However, powering more than 5 phones simultaneously results in a complete POE failure. The instant a sixth device is plugged in, all POE goes completely offline. None of the phones advertise that they're pulling more than 3.7W at the time of failure. Looking at the power status page for the Meraki switch shows that it's using 13.9 W of 1612 W (???) available prior to its failure.
 I've contacted Meraki support, and they thought it was "weird" that the switch shows 1612 W available, but they haven't provided any tips or thoughts on why that is. Thinking the switch was defective, I replaced it with another Meraki 120-48FP, but the exact same problem occurs. I've experimented with different ports (including powering up the devices in different order), but the same problem occurs. 
 The TL;DR version: Any five POE phones can be active, but the instant I power up a sixth POE phone, all POE goes offline.
 Has anyone seen this or something similar to it? I'm at my wit's end here and would greatly appreciate any troubleshooting tips.

It is my position that both the structured cabling team and our MSP need to work together. It is a spaghetti factory in the MDF and it is likely going to be frustrating and unnecessarily difficult to replace our infrastructure without organizing, repairing and overhauling the structured cabling in the MDF.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I posted to this sub and to the Cisco community on some extreme system slowdowns I suspected were caused by Cisco Secure Endpoint after deploying version 8.x clients.
 https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/108hl0q/cisco_secure_endpoint_customers_have_you_seen
 https://community.cisco.com/t5/endpoint-security/cse-8-0-1-and-8-1-3-causing-significant-slowdown-after-4-5-days/td-p/4731584
 After months of talking to TAC, they finally reproduced this and confirmed it's a bug. Long story short, it's a GDI object leak with Cisco Secure Client which is included with Secure Endpoint version 8.x.
 Both TAC and a Cisco employee in the above community thread said that the bug is fixed in 8.1.7, which will be released mid-April. I currently have a pre-release, unsupported 8.1.7 client added to my Secure Endpoint console for testing, and I can confirm that it is fixing the problem as intended.
 Wanted to provide an update for anyone that has been experiencing this.

 I haven't touched anything. Swear. Mostly because I vaguely know enough to break shit. 
 Anyway the problem is that over the last couple of days I've noticed internet performance on WiFi devices has gone to absolute crap. I have a 1200 Mbps internet connection and from wired devices I can get a speed test showing almost 1 gig down. Wifi devices connected to my Cisco APs is something like 180 Mbps on 5 Ghz and on 2.4 Ghz the speeds are like 60 Mbps down. I can tell something has gone on with the Cisco stuff because if I take the xfinity gateway out of bridge mode and use that WiFi I get download speeds similar to the wired download speeds. 
 Hoping some folks can give me some things to look at and hopefully get my wireless back to normal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflecting on my career one truth has always emerged: "The harder I worked, the more they took me for granted."
 It seems counter-intuitive, frustrating and demoralizing, so why is it?
 Well, simply put: They get used to it. When you consistently deliver high-quality work or go above and beyond what's expected, it can become the new norm. People may come to expect this level of effort from you without recognizing or acknowledging it.
 Another reason is that people may not realize how much effort you're putting in. If you're not vocal about your accomplishments or don't receive regular feedback or recognition, others may not be aware of the extent of your hard work.
 And lastly, you're running around all stressed out and scaring the commoners. Relax, everyone likes Tony, the IT guy who moves like a sloth, and doesn't react to anything, we love Tony! But then there's Marc, running around, always walking fast in the hallways, slow down Marc! His clothes are a little too tight, go up a size Marc, it's okay, relax.
 So what can you do about it? The answer is obvious, don't give so much, pull back a little. Now mind you, and put down the pitchforks, I'm speaking to my IT heroes out there, the ones who go above and beyond, answer the phone during Thanksgiving dinner, or Saturday morning at 2am.
 IT admins work in the background, they get no recognition or praise, we work in the shadows, in the server rooms and IDFs where no one can see.
 When things are working, great! "So, what exactly do you do here again?" And when things aren't working: "Hey, are you working on this or what is it you do here exactly?"
 So relax, and don't be a hero, they don't give a damn either way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/sysadmin!
 Just an FYI, I am about 6 months in to my first Sysadmin position and I have been enjoying it so far. That said, I am running into issues with a boss ask: Separate Domain Admin level ability (eg: GPO changes, ADUC, etc) from our existing Admin accounts. 
 Quick background of our environment:
  
Large enterprise with thousands of accounts and servers globally.
 Currently, privileges are tiered out like: 
 Admin Level Accounts, Admin rights on "high security" systems (eg:domain controllers, SCCM, core infrastructure, Active Directory / group policy management)
 Server Level Accounts. Admin rights on Utility or Application host boxes. 
 Branch Level Accounts. Unprivileged workstation accounts. 
 Tiered accounts only have logon rights to their respective Tiered Servers.
 
 Domain Level Servers require MFA for Local/RDP access. Our MFA solution uses federation out to Azure to authenticate. 
  
Now the ask: What would the best way to split DA functions to its own dedicated account, but will not have admin rights over anything but AD itself. 
 My idea was to Remove DA from the existing Admin Level accounts and create a dedicated "DA-Only" account that would not have login rights to any server (or only to a utility box), use the existing admin accounts to log into a jumpbox, and utilizing runas to open any tools needed to perform AD administration. That said, I am running into the problem where I cannot restrict the "DA-Only" accounts from local and TS login as that prevents that account from any sort of interactive login. 
 I would love to know if anyone else has done something like this or could point me in the right direction on how to implement. Thank you folks!

We need a way to quickly, easily, and reliably test our primarily Cat6 infrastructure for bandwidth, packet loss, and continuity. Additionally, we don't have anyone on staff that is an expert at networking, so having a tester that is easy to learn and use is almost a necessity, as we don't have the time or resources to learn complex networking concepts. For the most part, everything is Cat6, but the cable certifier needs to support potential future infrastructure upgrades such as Cat7/Cat8. Based on the research I've done, there are a few options, but I'm not sure which direction to go. I really like the look of the Fluke DSX2-8000, but I thought Fluke sold off their network testing line to NetAlly, so am I buying into a dead ecosystem? NetAlly doesn't seem to have an exact replacement for the DSX2-8000, but the EtherScope nXG looks promising. There's also the WireXpert 4500-PRO and NetXpert XG2 from Softing, but I'm worried those will be too complicated to learn and use effectively. Any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 Just wondering what kind of questions/exercises should I expect when being interviewed for a network automation role ? Will be there be a whiteboard coding session ?
 I've been interviewed for plenty of network engineer roles so I know what kind of questions will be asked.
 I have a repo with tons of projects I've worked, I'm familiar with the common libraries/tools used in network automation (ansible, nornir, netmiko, scrapli...SOT like netbox/nautobot) I know python and dabbled with frontend stuff like react and js. Also integrated backend technologies with some of my projects including SQL database, created my own APIs using fastapi or flask, made a full CI/CD pipeline using a dev/prod environment with pre/post check validations.
 I'm not a expert on the tools above, looking to cover as much ground as possible then become an expert on whatever tool the org uses once I'm in.
 I'm currently going through a course about python data structures and algorithms, this may be overkill for a role like this but honestly I don't know what to expect. Any tips/help so I can prepare would be appreciated!
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, MS put out a notice that they plan to deprecate boot.wim support in WDS. In a configuration-as-code model (which will soon be mandated if you are working in the US financial sector), many organizations are necessarily moving to Intune or other "DevOps" tools to do post-OS configuration and state management. What these tools lack is bare metal provisioning and native WDS fills this gap perfectly.
 And while I've always been a huge fan of SCCM/MECM, it's doesn't make sense to support that scale of infrastructure just for OSD. Likewise MDT also has a great many extraneous features and is, frankly, not suitable for the enterprise.
 I am aware that you can create a custom PE image that will boot to WDS but recent PE Setup OCs seem to lack some of the command line parameters that were present in earlier versions, and I feat that w/o official boot.wim support, custom PE support cannot be relied upon in a mission critical environment.
 And while third party and even some open source solutions exist (in fact I wrote my own a few years ago), using an MS provisioning tool to deploy MS operating systems is optimal in terms of streamlined support and vendor management.
 I created user feedback item here, Please upvote if you'd like see continued support for WDS.

First thing I say is "What the heck is going on over there?" I didn't even complete the sentence when their server pops back up online and the backup console says their online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok. So, I currently have 144 small mini computers (actually, 2021 Apple TV 4Ks) with a bespoke app in single-app mode that are used on film sets for displaying graphics on computer screens, with remote loading of content and a control protocol for color correction, etc.
 Works great.
 The issue I have is with the # that can be simultaneously powered on at a time and associate with an AP. I have found that Qualcomm's Networking Pro 1200 platform within a (wait for it..) Ubiquiti Amplifi Alien on channel 165 works great for my use-case. Channel 165 is the only channel I have available for use on a film set. All others are unavailable, especially DFS channels. These are never available, because of Teradek Bolt camera wireless video systems.
 On the Alien, I can easily power on 100 or so Apple TVs and they associate fine. But, beyond this number, I need to space them out by several minutes. If I wait a few minutes, I can easily get 144 client associations and everything works fine and dandy. But, the inability to power them all on simultaneously could be a problem. On some sets, this would be impractical, because the power for the entire set is turned off at wrap, and turned on at call time the next day. So, ideally, I'd be able to have 150-200 associations happen seamlessly and without delay.
 So, question is: what other vendors are using this Qualcomm Networking Pro 1200 chipset with 8x8:8 MU-MIMO on 802.11ax in an AP that perhaps has a quicker client association time?
 Had my eyes on a Ruckus R850, perhaps with a Netgear M4250 AV Line switch (model # GSM4210PD-100NAS) which has a built-in DHCP server, as we've had very good results with this series of switches generally.
 Thoughts? Got any better ideas? Thanks!

 For me, it's vital, that I can keep up with every little task that might come my way and since the few internal admins before me never bothered all too much with their work here, I don't have any tools, to manage my work with. Luckily, my employer is quite generous and told me, to make a list with necessary tools and equipment, which they are willing to purchase for me.
 I haven't gotten access to the entire infrastructure yet. In fact, I'm still pretty much just a user, with no admin access, whatsoever, but I suspect, that will be given to me in time.
 But until then, I need said tools, to manage my tasks and work and not lose sight of anything. I don't know, if I need a fully blown ticketing system yet, since there won't be too many inquires in the beginning, but something, to create projects with and manage all steps of the way, keeping track of steps in between and also logging all activities, I've written down, without having to manually save them, would be fantastic.
 Keep in mind, my former employer already had all the tools, but they were enterprise solutions for keeping tracks of dozens of customers. 
 If you have any recommendations and have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate any and all tips for my future work here.
 Thanks a lot and have a nice week!

 One of my clients is asking me to do a Tech refresh of his Infrastructure (core Switches).

 What can you guys suggest as an upgrade, considering the hardware is very old?
 the choices are between: Cisco Classic (9000 series) and Cisco Meraki.

 I know there is next to none context...but I wanted to have an idea to what kind of product is comparable to those ones

 I'm curious about it because users currently connect with GlobalProtect. Nearly all traffic is tunneled for URL filtering and inspection purposes. Two issues with that are how to dynamically handle the exceptions for what is not tunneled and public WIFI connections that redirect to a captive portal to accept terms before allowing a user out to the internet. For whatever reason, EDL's can't be used to define tunneling exceptions.
 My consideration of the Windows client is mostly driven by the ability to manage it with group policy and possibility to be a more seamless experience for users.

 I'm currently considering re-evaluating the endpoint security stack, and I wanted to get some thoughts and opinions on the best options for remote only devices. It's been a while since I've tested most of the products and I know some of the products would have likely changed a fair amount. As I suspect most products would have adjusted by now to device only and zero trust.
 The environment does have a large amount of application change and custom plugin development thus solutions like Windows Applocker and ThreatLocker would have way too much administrative overhead. Locking down the binaries could work if it was an automated system existed based on a Security Sandbox (Crowdstrike, VMRay, etc) but this would still be limited capability (file-less, etc).

 I'm moving the company to a new plant and I have the opportunity to reorganize the network. I have about 100 users, in the network I have file server, applications and remote workers . I have a couple of L3 switch DELL 5048F connected with VLT as core switch. The perimeter firewall is hardware and it is connected to the core switch with 2x1GB cable. To the core switches are also connected the ESX host that contains all the production VM. In order to increase the network security I want restrict the traffic to some VLANs where the virtual machinaes are connected. The question is: is it better filter the traffic with the perimetere firewall, with the ACL on the switch or the better solution is to introduce an additional internal firewall as virtual machine?
 This is a schematic L2 connection

 In my opinion the virtual firewall appliance should be the better solution (statefull inspection, maneageability, ecc.). I will be "tromboning" but I think it will be acceptable.

 I'm running a backup server with a Quantum Superloader 3 directly connected by SAS. The server has both Backup exec and Veeam backup and replication. Veeam has taken over as our main backup for onsite and scaling out,however i'd like to use it for tape backups as an additional air-gapped last resort backup.
 ​
 Backup exec works fine with the tape loader however Veeam doesn't seem to acknowledge the tapes. I've reinstalled the drivers from Quantum and added the server in Veeam as a tape library. Any advise on what to try next? Does having backup exec on the server cause issues with other applications accessing the tape drive even once closed and services have been stopped? The fact it works fine on in Backup Exec suggests drivers and hardware are all fine.

 I play Rocket League professionally and I'm based in the UK. Rocket League is extremely sensitive to jitter for whatever reason and I'm having a real issue with it at the moment. Unfortunately, playing at a high level requires very low jitter.
 I currently use Zen Internet (FTTP) and have a high-end router and have noticed my routing to the Rocket League servers is pretty bad. Here's a link to a WinMTR showing the issue: Routing
 The first few hops always have pretty bad jitter along them and it's incredibly annoying, resulting in a lot of in-game issues. It gets worse at peak times. 
 I have contacted Zen about this issue but they won't — or can't — do anything. I use WTFast to circumvent further bad exchanges and that helps a lot, but there's still significant jitter and I feel this is because the first few hops are still used when routing. If I'm wrong about that, please let me know.
 Ultimately, I'm looking to change ISPs because of this. It's losing me money and time and is negatively affecting my mental health. To my understanding, I can't really know whether the routing of an ISP will be good or not without purchasing it first. What are my options here?
 I'd be very grateful if anyone from the UK can run a WinMTR to the same server and list their ISP alongside. To be clear, this issue is the same with pretty much all Rocket League servers.
 Thank you for your time and effort. I'll do my best to respond to comments!

Lately we've had a few HP & Dell laptops (Intune managed, AAD joined) come in with dead batteries not holding charge - after a replacement, they start getting issues relating to the CMOS checksum & TPM, which usually throws the laptops into Bitlocker recovery mode. Initially I thought the CMOS battery was also EOL but replacing that doesn't seem to help, neither does clearing the TPM either through BIOS or through Windows security settings. 
 It's gotten to the point where we've recalled the laptops that have had battery replacements and issued new ones due to the amount of tickets getting raised, but the laptops are still serviceable so I would like to come up with a solution to get them back into circulation. I used to work for an MSP and their hardware department would flat out refuse to fix or change any hardware on an Intuned laptop, including the battery. 
 Any advice please?

 I'm using a secure access solution and I need to be able to open SSH sessions to servers using an SSH key - it can be done from windows command line / powershell with a command like this:
 ssh -p [port] [64_character_string]@server.domain.com
 But I want to use Tera Term. I can't find any command line syntax to do it.
 Can this be done? Does the SSH key need to be saved to a file or something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am configuring a bunch of cisco switches, and I have tried to automate my process.I have a simple python script that is sending all the config via xmodem to the device, then i set the management ip and save the config.This works fine, but, some of the switches, even after setting the managament ip in the managament, are automaticlaly changing that vlan to DHCP.
 Example:
 * (Boot a blank switch, say no to auto-configuration). > enable # copy xmodem: running-config # conf t # interface vlan 10 # ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0 # end # write mem 
 At this point, everything works fine. But, in some cases, when i connect a trunk cable from my network to that switch and do "show run int vlan 10" i see that it has changed to "ip address dhcp". This doesn't happen all the time, only some times.
 I have a small suspicion that it might be caused by PnP, but i have no idea how to avoid it or turn it off.
 Even after reloading the switch, some of them still keep the dhcp thing.Please help. its driving me nuts!
 Ps: (The reason i started sending config via xmodem is because when i was copy-pasting the configs, i had to do it un chunks, as it would ofter overflow the serial buffer. And sending line-by-line via the script takes forever.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit!
 I'm gonna get straight to the point on this one.
 I work for a large company with 2k+ employees, obviously we have quite a huge load on our HR and Salary department with all these employees. Currently whenever someone needs to hire someone, onboard someone, change an employeement agreement etc they do it via Microsoft forms that are connected to PowerAutomate to send the information to the correct place / inbox, this has been quite chaotic and we are looking into getting a proper "HR Service management" or ticketing system for HR and Salary instead.
 We have looked into the Freshservice HR workspace but since Freshservice is built for IT first it makes me quite sceptical, we also need to be able to easily create HR processes for recruitment orders, workpermits and employee changes and this has proven quite troublesome in the Freshservice demo I've worked with setting up. A lot of bugs and the documentation for Fresh leaves a lot to be desired.
 Therefore we are looking at other solutions but it's difficult to find out there, any tips or pointers?
 Our biggest needs are:
  
Users being able to submit tickets to HR, and HR being able to easily view and process said tickets.
 Users being able to order new recruitments, HR then needs to be able to view current ongoing recruitment processes in some sort of list or "view" listing all ongoing recruitments.
 Users being able to send in work permits with HR being able to track current workpermits, aswell as being alerted when a work permit is about to expire.
 Integration into Salesforce and Azure is a must.
 All of the above needs to be exported once a month as a .csv to our HR master so it can stay up to date with the changes.
 Bonus if it has support for integration / APIs with Teamtailor.
  
Thank you very much in advance Reddit, any tips are helpful and very much appreciated. Sorry for potentially poor grammar or spelling, English is not my first language.

 I've been contemplating setting an auto reply to tickets featuring keywords and waiting 30 minutes. But I suspect that won't go over well.

 Logging in with LAPS on any machine which IS connected to the domain still works fine, so I'm forced to conclude it's ONLY broken on the two machines I specifically need it on.

I have a job with my current company, who I will defiantly stay on with but have 2 and half options (ill explain the half) as to how I continue my progression and education.
 - I can go for a degree apprenticeship, level 5/6 in networking
 - I can not do any more apprenticeships and focus on individual qualifications i.e. CompTIA net, sec, etc...
 - I can try go for level 4 in security, but this is a half option as I'm not sure I would be able to complete this with my company
 I want to work out what will give me the best value going forward. I think my favourite areas of IT are definitely networking and security so would like to move into a role focused on either/both of those in the future.

 What is important to us is:
  
It should always work, even if internet fails.
 It should be secure, i.e. people should not be able to access the system.
 Preferably it checks for updates online (e.g. webpage, docker container pull, snap update) 
 Alternatively, if we can remote desktop into it, we could manually update it
 
 Remote management/maintenance (SSH or remote desktop).
  
Good to know
  
We have made the app ourselves, so if needed, we can wrap it in electron.
 The app uses angular routing, so simple file:// hosting could be problematic.
 For hardware, we have an Intel NUC and a touchscreen display.

 ​
 I want to use Huntress in a network that should not have direct connect to non-private IPs.
 According to Huntress, there is currently no support for "explicit-proxy-configurations". Currently, I am trying to find any other option.
 ​
 My first attempt was to assign one internal IP to every external DNS-connection, Huntress needs and to use HAProxy there as "non-decrypting" proxy:
 ​
 listen huntress-tcp bind 10.xx.xx.xx:443 mode tcp server-template huntress-aws- 1 huntress.io:443 check resolvers docker init-addr libc,none 
 --> And then to change in \etc\hosts:
 10.xx.xx.xx huntress.io 
 ...but I am still getting timeouts, when I try to connecto to https://huntress.io
 ​
 Do you have any idea on how to solve this without opening the network to the "full range of AWS-IPs", If I cannot work with DNS wildcards?
 ​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am in desperate look out for a cost-effective eBGP agg router that can cope with up to 4 uplinks with full bgp table.
 The thing is my traffic is very little, it will not even exceed 100mbps!
 All the routers that can cope with this routing table size are quite oversized for my network throughput.
 The most cost-effective option is Mikrotik, but from a pure image perspective, it may not work for us.
 From what I can see, the cheapest option would be Cisco ASR 1001-X with 16GB of RAM. Any other idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 This may be an issue for r/helpdesk or some such, but I think it qualifies for this sub as well. I have a user that has some issues with Excel files. Specifically, the files when opened via SMB using file explorer are opening verly slowly. So a 30 MB excel file will only download at like 10 Mb, so it takes forever. 
 The files when opened using the Recent Files tab in Excel work just fine. As expected. Also they work without issue over OneDrive or when saved locally. 
 Googling this issue reveals it is an issue with Excel file validation. So I turned it off. Still having the issue. Just curious if anyone here has any suggestions or ideas, or perhaps has encountered this issue themselves.

 What's the "Correct" or prefered way of managing all the customers diffrent 365 accounts?
 I've got some where I have an unlicenced admin account on their domain that I use but that gets messy logging in and out of everything constantly.
 I'm in the middle of setting a new one up and thought why not just add a new domain to my account and manage it all in one place. Seemed to work alright initially but there's no way of seperating the two organizations and one drive had my org details on it.
 After searching online I found out about tenants being part of multiple orgs but nothing about how to set that up from scratch. 
 Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems to be the right place to ask, though I guess the question is a bit low-level...
 I've got a new FreePBX system replacing an old one, very similar, just a much newer version; the OS is based on Centos. Networking and Linux aren't my forte! The system has one card connected to our LAN and another connected to a dedicated Cisco DSL router which comes from our SIP trunks provider.
 I have got it setup so that it mostly works, but initial connections to the web server and to a soft phone are very slow. For instance 50 seconds to initiate a call. After that it's often quicker, which then makes diagnoses more difficult.
 I previously setup the old one up and think I had similar issues, but that was not too far off a decade ago!
 I have tried to copy the default gateway (and other routes) in each case
 Old one
 ​ default 11.11.11.11 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth1 
 (I have replaced the correct IP address with 11.11.11.11)
 New one
 default gateway 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth1 
 (The new one just has the word gateway, I entered it with the ip address.)
 Any suggestions of what I should be doing to work it out, or obvious reasons for this behaviour?

 It’s a complicated environment so I’m thinking a list of infrastructure projects to help me get to know the team and have something to show my new boss. 
  
checking/learning/trial run of their disaster recovery and backups -tabletop exercises- what happens if server a goes down, switch b does, etc -meeting with each of my team separately to see what they have for projects, pain points, wishes -Review existing IT documentation -not sure if the political atmosphere leans this way yet, but if I have my way spending time in each IT role doing the job to get a feel for what they are doing/encountering
  
Find out how they are managing IT budget and schedule what is next to order or plan for on the annual schedule
 How are they doing contract management and are there any contracts coming due this year that I need to plan or budget for
 I have one project that is almost to completion that has stalled. I’m well versed and could whip it out pretty quick- How long do I wait before prodding it to completion? I could literally do this day 1 but it wouldn’t be appropriate. No one likes that guy. 
 Non-IT side- 
 Meet with all of the different departments to introduce myself, ask if they have any pain points, any currents projects, any future projects, any wishes, or anything else that I can do to help or make their lives easier
 So…what’s your first 90 days look like?

 Possible role: System Administrator - $65k *commute 50 minutes *M-F schedule from 7-3 *comes with Top Secret Security Clearance *more of what I want to do career wise 
 So I currently work as a contractor for a F500 company as a NOC Tech. The company makes all new hires contract to perm and the track record is, if you make it 6 months, you are converted to salary (I have been here for ~2 months). I currently make $80k as a contractor but have little to no benefits to speak of. When converted, the salary is $70k. As a caveat, I am not really enjoying the work and can see why the turnover rate is sky high. 
 I have been contacted by a company that I applied for shortly before starting this position for an interview as a system administrator. The company is in the aerospace and defense industry and the programs it supports are very intriguing to me. The role also comes with a top secret security clearance. I would also be getting hired on as a salaried employee with full benefits and a starting salary of $65k. 
 My career goal was to become a system administrator and an engineer following that. So I could also see myself moving up or out of the Sys. Admin role within the next 2 years as well (if all goes well of course). I guess my concern would be switching jobs so soon after starting the one I am at and the commute is double the time. Idk. 
 What would you chose? Any input is appreciated! 
 *all this could obviously be null and void if I am not selected anyway.

 I have a question regarding Cisco Business 150AX. I want to set up 802.1x authentication (using a RADIUS/NPS server) with dynamic VLAN assignment.
 I noticed that there is a limitation of 16 VLANs, but I couldn't find anywhere if this limitation is static or dynamic. In other words, is it possible to have more than 16 VLANs via 802.1x?
 Since I'm going to have to trunk between my switch and the terminal, does the limit apply at the trunk level or at the AP level itself? Or does it have to do with the number of simultaneously active VLANs?
 Thank you very much for your help. I have spent a lot of time looking for this information on the internet and in the documentation, but I have not found anything about this.

 I'm looking for the most resilient INSIDE Layer3 design with what I have. I have up to 2 physical interfaces on each Nexus 3k's that I can use for these Layer3 links. The ASA has plenty of physical interfaces to work with.
 I'm looking for the most resilient configuration possible, with the hardware that I have, to advertise the default route from the ASA and the SVI's from the core switches. I would prefer to stay away from static routes (other than the default route on the OUTSIDE interface) if I can. EIGRP or OSPF would be preferred.
 There seems to be heavy debate about using vPC's for layer 3 links. Some say its possible, depending on hardware/code version, some say that even if it IS possible, its poor design. Some people seem to recommend ECMP from the firewall.
 To the community: Would you please loan me your experience and provide some advice for my scenario, with some configuration examples?
 Thank you all SO very much for your contributions. 
 Mike

 Would it be possible to isolate a web server with pfsense in between that prevents it to access the lan? Like https://i.imgur.com/asmlj7Q.png. It would be like a cheap-o DMZ, sort of. The aim is to prevent the LAN to be attacked if the web server is compromised.
 I'm working in a small company where everyone is connected to the same wireless router and I don't want to change anything (put anything in between the router and the LAN clients). The web server is for test purposes so it won't be used for anything serious. But I still want to make sure that if it gets hacked it can't reach the LAN.
 Would this work? Is it safe? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read quite a bit about fairshare, but is this still a hot topic with Server 2019 and 2022? Also, it seems to be problematic as soon as a user uses a performance hungry application and generates 100% load.
 Are there any other windows default settings that can be changed to improve performance?
 We have storage with SSDs in place and sufficient vCPUs and RAM for the RDS hosts (Server 2019), but the hosts seem relatively slow when opening Office applications. The machines are booting extremely fast since they are on the ssds, but the RDS environment seems a little bit slow.
 The performance with only one logged in user is the same as with 10 logged in users.
 ​
 Specs: 
 5-10 users per Host
 10 vCPUs
 64GB RAM
 FSLogix Profiles

 Thank you guys!

Their request was that they do not want anything that needs expensive memberships. The cost of the equipment wasn't a problem. A logical amoubt for a membership will not be a problem. So i created the network with 4 ubiquiti switches, a MikroTik 48 port PoE switch and a CCR-1016-12G and 2 WANs for redunduncy. I would like to keep all of the existing setup. Please note that the firewall on the MikroTik is well configured, and there is port security on each switch. 
 My question is: would you adding any kind of firewall before the MikroTik router - something like a NGFW or some kindof IPS/IDS? I feel that the mikrotik firewall rules just don't cut it for today's standards and network moniroting and/or blocking is necessary. What kind of firewall could i add before the existing router that could filter trafic before it reaches the internal network?
 Basically it seems like i might need a transparent firewall.

So I am going a VPS route because I am a sysadmin/DevOps and can install/maintain myself and I don't want to fight limitations and obstacles of normal web hosting, managed databases, it even hard to find this combo. Also I don't know what those apps expect from system so VPS is a safe route because you can customize everything.
 So recommend good VPS hosting which also offers sql server (as a separate service or install into VPS from their media/license).
 I can install SQL server myself, that would be even prefered, but I don't want to bother my clients with separate swl server licensing for VM in VPS hosting so I would like that to be solved by VPS provider.

Then two weeks later another user has the same issue as well as me. I found KB5023696 was installed the same day, uninstalled it and RDP began working again. I removed the KB from all of the users whom had RDP issues and this resolved the issue. The two week hold was our RMM software holding back updates as we have it setup. I am not sure why that KB is breaking RDP for users but I hope this helps another sysadmin from trying to determine why RDP broke. The weirdest part is it is hit or miss as some users with the update do not have issues while others can't work at all.

Yet, I think for many of us, we are in this space of being willing to learn, but its hard to understand just what direction. Then when we do choose one, its got 50 branches. 
 ​
 Future seems to be cloud, and IMO not IaaS but PaaS and SaaS.
 Been cruising along and learning Power Platform. This is on top of O365 Teams, SharePoint and all the admin portals to do normal traditional Sysadmin stuff, along with PowerShell scripting and command to admin those portals via CLI.
 Then just the other day I am trying to automate something, and it seems to do it I need to use Microsoft graph. I never even heard of this before two days ago. I was able to setup things in O365 to connect in and "get" the data I wanted. Then I realized that I have no idea how to output it in some readable format for an end user. Looks like Python dictionaries. Pretty sure its web code, I am not a web dev. I know I can figure it out but:
 Where do I draw the line? Where do I focus? I have fun going down each rabbit hole I open, but where do I ensure that I am ultimately valuable as an employee, which in turn means I cand ensure I am compensated? Money isn't everything, but at the end of the day I want to make it, and I am a company man, a 9-5er, a person that likes to clock in and clock out. Whatever you call it.

 IP address (IP)
 Subnet Mask (SNM)

 DNS2 
 I forgot to give them a port on our switch. When the install date came, they called me all day asking for assistance. However, I was busy and couldn't return their call. By the time I got back to them, they had already taken the network down, and caused a real mess breaking our connection to the main office, and kicking some remote workers offline. I asked them why they couldn't wait to install it, and they said they had scheduled this two weeks ago. We lost some business over it. About 2 hours where the network was completely down. The camera technician managed to bring it back up somehow. I thought it was their fault, and wrote my boss a Cover Your Ass (CYA) ("mine"). He immediately shot back with "Why didn't you give them a port?!" I'm feeling really stupid over this, and feel like I might be losing my job when I go in Monday. Has anyone ever done this before, and forgotten to tell a vendor which port to use? 
 TLDR: I forgot to give our camera company a port to use their static IP on. Now I'm in some hot water.

 We are considering moving to MS 365 from Google Workspace for a multitude of reasons. Most steps are straightforward, as far as Google Drive, Gmail to Exchange Online (and I've done exchange migrations in the past), etc
 As we are running through our prep checklist with sales department, we realized there is going to be a major snag, that we haven't considered.
 Our Sales team is using their "Google Account" instead of email/password to authenticate against a multitude of services, for example - HubSpot, various marketing sites, and a multitude of other tools that they use.
 Their Google accounts are ["joan.smith@COMPANY.com](mailto:"joan.smith@COMPANY.com)" not "@gmail.com), since "company.com", is now going to be hosted by MS, their "social logins" are now going to be Microsoft's ones, not Google's.
 While I can assist them with migrating a couple of these services to email/password authentication, instead of "Social Login", I'm sure we are not the first people to run into this problem.
 So is there a suggested way to do it? Or are we in the dreaded territory of "VENDOR LOCK IN" ?
 🙀
 P.S.:
 35 people start up. But not a tech one. So we have 1 IT - person - me. Migrating 700 = 35 people x 20-30? Social login accounts on various websites - is not something I want to tackle.

 I'm currently stuck with a network problem. Maybe one of you can help me.
 For a shake test of an RJ45 to fiber optic converter, it must be checked for correct functionality during the simulated earthquake.
 What do I have in mind: My idea would be the following structure... Laptop -> (RJ45 cable) -> Converter -> (FO loop TX to RX)
 https://ibb.co/vLvQz5R
 Now I think I know that the UDP protocol is one-way and I can use a python script with the socket library to send a UDP packet over the laptop's ethernet interface to itself over the loop with the converter. If the packet arrives at the open socket, the connection is OK.
 Unfortunately this doesn't work. I receive the sent packet at any time. The packet is probably still delivered internally in the computer and does not leave it via the Ethernet interface. I tried to set up a route locally for the IP used (Route add 192.168.1.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 IF 9). Unfortunately, this also does not bring the desired result.
 I would be very grateful for any food for thought.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have 50+ HP desktops of the same model new in the box that need to be deployed in the coming weeks. Long story short - we recently had a cyber attack that resulted in us rebuilding our network/servers and we lost a couple of staff along the way who were the ones who usually handled our imaging process. On top of that our software packages have broken links and don't run correctly with the network rebuild, so we're not in good shape.
 The good thing is, most of our staff use the exact same base build on their devices, so if there is a way to clone one good image to multiple devices that are the same model, that would be ideal for this project. We have the software install packages, but manually pushing them can take 2-3 hours per computer and requires a few reboots. We have been lucky thus far to not need to replace a lot of PC's since the outage, and I was able to build several of them as spares to swap out if needed using the manual process.
 I know there are multiple tools out there that do many things, so I am mostly wondering what some recommendations are for something that will get the job done. We do have a couple KVM's so can image multiple at a time - but how do we package a clone of an image to push out, and what does that process look like - especially with joining devices to the domain.
 In my old job at an MSP, we just manually installed everything per device as we had a lot of small companies that requested maybe 2-3 computers at a time on average, so it was not a big deal. Prior to that I worked for a large hospital that had SCCM set up to deploy Windows on PXE boot, which was very nice, but I have no idea how that process was set up. Though I'd like to eventually find the time to create something like that for our environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working on an IT project for a medical practice with multiple doctors, staff, etc. They print about 5-6k pages a week in total. They currently use a Kyocera EcoSys M3655idn. They are happy with it so far, but they are currently leasing it and would rather own one and have it serviced in-house by their own IT team which they are in the process of forming.
 Their requirements are fairly basic in terms of features: b/w printing, duplex, copy, scan, fax
 I primarily recommend Brother printers to all my small-biz and home office clients, but this is a larger staff and higher print volume than any that I have dealt with in the past.
 Will appreciate the recs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left my last job because it got boring (normal sys-/network admin job), now I'm working as a DevOps & cloud engineer (and as a sysadmin in the shadows)... and to be honest, I think I'm ready to move up a notch again, but I don't really want to leave the company. Tbh they are too small with 30 devs (yet >50% growth per year).
 It's cool that I can help migrate & automate the whole infrastructure and implement new technologies by grinding myself into oblivion, but it seems like I don't have the time to improve the stuff that really needs it - and only build MVPs infrastructure wise, because anything better 'costs too much money - who will pay for this?'. I have no time to tinker like I had some years ago... and our sysadmins are ready waiting for months for some scripts that will make their life 100x easier - but I have no time and now I'm only suffering the perpetual grind of building new novel environments for customers - and can't even do them right because of #AGILE - the sprint is over, bye bye to the budget. Still, colleague wise and in terms of teamwork and communication you can't compare them to any other companies... Quality of life has improved substancially. Less stress - not having to support braindead people is wonderful - but I'm bored.
 I'm feeling like if I don't work on the real, large stuff... on the edge of new tech... I will just lose more time and this will become my new normal. I need to learn new tools, better ways of thinking and want to work on larger projects.
 Anyone here who was in a similar situation? What did you do?
 And nah, I won't post this on /r/devops first, thanks to you guys I even got this far. You'll surely push me further into the abyss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow networkers,
 We are currently swapping out a bunch of Nexus 3548-X switches and replacing them with 9300 series with VXLAN/EVPN.
 We have an OOB network in place but it's aging and i would like to use 3548 for that. Each of the new OOB switches would perform these functions:
  
connect all management ports for the fabric & console servers
 each leaf would have a dedicated 10G interface to OOB switch for SPAN monitoring
 we wouls transport these SPAN sessions via OOB network to packet brokers and VM for troubleshooting.
 each leaf would have a dedicated 1/10G interface for dataplane monitoring towards OOB switch.
 Each OOB switch would run perfSonar suite in guestshell and perform e2e performance tests - iperf etc.. towards other OOB agents via dedicated VXLAN.
 The collected data would be exported via telemetry
  
Anyone else here doing something similar ? Any advice how to extend OOB for more use-cases ?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have found in my 14 years of working in this field that I start to look for other work as soon as I feel under valued by my management and peers. I was hired into this company last year specifically because they had no one filling the role of Cybersecurity. For a year, most of my security recommendations or critical flags have been met with “that is too much work and we can’t afford to possibly break systems to implement that”. I love the job otherwise and have so much freedom and truly little stress of other tasks or expectations. How do I get over my ego and stay with a company longer?
 EDIT: I didn’t want to spark a debate about the cybersecurity vs sysadmin war. I value people’s time and a business’s right to say no. A few have answered my question perfectly, but the goal here was coaching on being satisfied with a job that has value, but I have a problem when I see need/urgency but leadership sometimes ignores core security for paths of least resistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I have multiple computers I can create clusters (maybe with a technology like k8s), and with a bit of work, I can be sure to have near 100% service uptime. Meaning no matter what, even if something happens, another computer is going to handle the requests and everything will be 100% transparent to the end user. That's because the service was designed to handle such cases, maybe by running inside docker, allowing state recovery, and whatnot.
 But here I am wondering about cloud services (AWS and Azure for example). If my knowledge is up to date, these guys have big machines (like terabytes of RAM and tens of cores on a single motherboard), and they use a hypervisor to split these into smaller VM, that they can then rent.
 But in such a case, they cannot run a single VM on different computers right ? So what do they do if one of their computer suddenly has a break down ? If their architecture is designed like I described in the previous paragraph, then all the VM on that machine suddenly shutdown, and their services are no longer available ? So there is now way that they can promise near 100% machine uptime ?
 And even if you keep your machine 100% healthy, with zero internet downtime, you have your own generator in case of electric failure, how to you update your hypervisor ? Wouldn't they need a reboot from time to time ? And if you need to change components, how do you move a running VM from one machine to another ?
 I am not a sys admin btw, I do datascience and AI, so way more math and way less programming, but I am deeply interested in how they solved the problem, so don't hesitate to start from the basics, and many thanks for your time.

 But someone sets up a rogue AP with the same SSID: mycoy and also commercially signs their radius cert: company.xy. My wifi clients get fooled and take the bait?

 I use to work for both Cox and Comcast. Once a router reached EoL status we recommended the customer swap routers.
 Sometimes it felt wrong, especially if the system knew the customer had old equipment, it would just immediately dismiss any other possible issues and refer customer to OEM/Purchase New Router. 
 Other times I would spend 30mins+ checking lines and factory resetting, hardlining into the router and then into the modem and ping testing and guiding the customer through it all just for it to end up being an issue with the EoL Airport. 
 Is it an issue with the outdated firmware handling a more modern modem? or is it just the age of the router and something internally failing? It always felt wrong of me to tell someone to replace the router for it being EoL because otherwise it was capable of handling the customers speeds.

 So we are running Azure AD Connect and just hybrid syncing Edge. The auto login works fine.
 We have no licenses besides the free Azure AD Connect. The Edge Sync has always worked fine, bookmarks, etc.
 Suddenly I have all of my existing users still syncing, even if logging into a workstation they have never used before. But somewhere along the line new user accounts after "X" date are not syncing. It shows the following in edge://sync-internals/ 
 DISABLED_BY_ADMIN, STOP_SYNC_FOR_DISABLED_ACCOUNT, Microsoft Information Protection service is disabled" 
 So after a bunch of trial and error, the only option I had was to do the P2 License Trial just to see what happened and enable ESR. And of course that works, the new users are now able to sync.
 So my questions are, 
 1: Has anyone seen or run into this before? I am seeing conflicting info about how we should not have been able to sync at all without a P1/P2 license to begin with, and other places say no that basic sync was enabled a year or two ago.
 2: Since I have the trial P2 license, I have not assigned any licenses to any users, just enabled ESR. Can I get away with just a single license after the trial to keep ESR enabled?

I want to say be cool with your IT person as maybe this could have gone down for this customer in a better way if they had just reached out and talked with me explaining how they were bringing in their own people. The original owner never said a word or anything yet I was there for them every step of the way even during snow storms to drive there before business opened to push power buttons on surge protectors to turn equipment back on because no one could remember how to push this button even after explaining a few times. Anyways they signed contract and we are going to hold them to it and let it go to collections if needed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[we are using the intune app by techaffinityinc to sync intune with freshservice
 but: as most of our devices are lenovo devices and intune gets the full MTM instead of a friendly name, we have too much products created automaticaly in freshservice.
 has anybody an idea, how to get this fixed and use user-friendly family names instead of the complete MTM?
 example:
 Model (machine type) = 20FMS08H00
 The first 4 digits (20FM) denote the readable model: ThinkPad T460
 This includes MTM with (20FM,20FN)
 The MTM <-> Family can be seen in the table https://download.lenovo.com/bsco/schemas/list.conf.txt
 has anybody already dealed with this?
 maybe a a solution is written here: https://www.systanddeploy.com/2023/01/get-list-uptodate-of-all-lenovo-models.html
 Which refers to these scripts: https://github.com/damienvanrobaeys/Lenovo_Models_Reference
 but i have no idea how to implement it in freshservice
 ​
 other idea was, to write back the family name in intune and map this to product in the app. but i´m not a friend of using wrong fields for other purposes. custom attributes is only available for mac devices. not for win. so any other idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 90% sure the culprit is a particular LOB app. The LOB app support claims that it is impossible (after multiple escalations) 
 What it boils down to is that SOMETHING is creating a mapped drive as the "system user". This results in the drive showing up as "disconnected" but yet still working when you click on it. However this makes certain functionalities of the program trying to access that drive flakey. This system user mapping takes place "before" the normal user drive mapping gpo takes place. 
 The only way to resolve it is to use psexec and run:
  
psexec -s -i cmd.exe
 net use :x /delete
  
If you do this, then log off the profile and back on, the gpo takes over and properly maps the drive as the user and everything is fine until the next reboot.
  
Things tried/checked:
  
Log on/off Scripts (none)
 Scheduled Task
 GPO (Disabled all of them)
 Startup Items (using lastruns)
 Registry (even manually deleted any possible reference) 
 Uninstalled LOB app then manually deleted any folders or files related to it, including appdata, etc
  
Where else could this possibly "live"? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I'm a 26-year-old with a background in networking and computer hardware, as well as experience in sales, inventory management, and SAP. 
 I'm not from the US.
 I worked for about 3 years in a computer store that sold anything under the sun, think amazon but with local stores and fixing computers in the back office. After 2 years I became the manager of that store and had 3 workers under me.
 After leaving my job as a computer store manager, I traveled Europe with my girlfriend in a motorhome. Now that I have some free time, I'm planning to study for the CCNA certification and pursue a career as a sys admin.
 I studied networking in high school through a Cisco program, and while I had the knowledge for CCNA, I never got the certificate. After highschool I was in the army ( I was a tank driver) so I forgot most of my ccna knowledge a I had.
 I also have experience with light server administration through my home server running OMV and several Raspberry Pis.
 I'm interested in hearing your advice on what areas I should focus on as I work toward becoming a sys admin. I believe I'll have to start in a help desk role and work my way up, but I'm not sure what specific skills and knowledge I should prioritize. Are there other certifications or training programs that you would recommend? How much will a degree help and if it will, in what subject? 
 Before the computer store I did 3 months in tech support in an isp, but hated every second.
 I'm eager to learn and grow in this field, and I would appreciate any advice you can offer based on your experiences. Thank you in advance for your help!

Any ideas or guidelines as to what I should look into?

The client had already removed the bottom so I first checked some of the hardware and made sure it wasn’t stuffed full of dust or anything. Then I put it back on to start troubleshooting other ways
  
I tried restarting
 using the fn keys to see if the screen was simply dimmed down all the way
 I tried plugging into external monitors to see if maybe it was the laptop screen but they wouldn’t display anything either.
 I then booted into the bios and it worked. 
  
I was going to see if maybe there was a firmware update or something that caused this and thought maybe I should roll it back but I thought maybe it would be best to just see if I can get into windows first. I was able to without any issues. 
 My question is.. why did booting into the bios fix the issue? Any ideas? 
 Also, does anyone else get mixed feelings when this kind of thing happens. I feel happy that I was able to help them but I also feel imposter syndrome because I don’t totally know how I fixed the issue… sorry for writing so much. Hope you are having a nice day.

I was not to worried about it before because basically they are known to be scammy but recently we have had customers getting bouncebacks from Microsoft and Gmail services as well.

 Now, what I am not sure about is if its worth paying that extra money for the "Deep Buffer" version for 4-5 10Gbit Clients connected to Cisco, connected to the SNS Evo 16 working on 1080/4k content. 
 Anybody know?

 They're immediately up-front with what the position is, what the pay is, and even attaches the detailed job description in the very first message.
 Are you paying attention, recruiters? THAT is how you attract the attention of quality people who are going to be what you want. Stop beating around the bush; put the important information front and center, with a reasonable salary, and you'll have the position filled in no time.

 "Engineer Shopping", according to him, is when someone gets told "no" about accessing something, then goes around that person and/or over their head until they find the weak spot that says "yes". The weak spot could potentially be exploited if the user was a bad actor, and that's the type of thing they look for.
 I believe the guy, but I want to learn more about it - because I'm encountering a user just like that. It sure seems like it should be a CyberSecurity issue, but what do I look up?
 p.s. I thought this was too simplistic for the CyberSecurity sub - after reading some of their discussions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having issues deciphering the best method to prevent one VLAN on a Cisco C1111-8P from intervlan routing. I have read a pile of posts (spoiler alert- I am not proficient at ALL in IOS- it's one I inherited) and I seem to get a different answer each time.
 The configuration is dead nuts simple- single WAN, 2 vlans. I want VLAN A to get anywhere, but I want VLAN B to ONLY be able to access the internet WAN, not VLAN A.
 Over simplified, yes- but you get it. And I know it's an extremely easy solution- I just can't seem to wrap my head around it using access lists, etc so I am really hoping someone is willing to hold my hand. I haven't had to muck around in a Cisco for about 10 years.
 This is in a production environment, with a permit all access list for each VLAN so I really don't want to start to mess around and put the place into a tail spin. I just think the answer is in there somewhere. I tried to convince them to source a guy who knows Cisco better than I, but they want me to do it. I know I can, I am just really, really rusty- so I am reaching out for a little help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, we are an exchange online hybrid environment and I'm having an issue with one user who is not able to access public folders via the Microsoft 365 Outlook client. When clicking into any public folder- the user gets a message that says "Cannot display the folder. Unknown Error" within the pane where the contents of the public folders are to be displayed. This issue started today.
 Background: 
  
User's mailbox is on exchange online 
 Public folders are hosted on exchange online.
 No one else seems to be having this issue
 New users I am creating on exchange online do not have this issue.
 No reports of other users having this issue including myself
 As of yesterday it was still working
 User is able to access the public folders via outlook.office365.com by adding the public folders to favorites on the left hand pane.
  
Solutions tried:
  
Recreating Outlook Profile and deleting the .ost file - Did not work
 Repaired Microsoft Office 365 suite - Did not work
 Set up outlook profile on two other machines within the network - Did not work.
 Set up outlook profile on a machine outside of the network - Did not work.
 Tried playing around with cached/uncached mode - Did not work.
  
I have created a ticket for Microsoft support as I'm suspecting this is one of the weird service issues that are affecting a small number of users. They haven't responded and was wondering is anyone experiencing this issue? Last thing I want to do is to recreate the person's AD account or something along those lines. There isn't a detailed error message for me to go off of and this is driving me nuts and most users within our environment rely heavily on public folders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This maybe an odd post, but I was introduced recently to a Framework laptop. I had heard of them before, but never thought about the device or looked into them. However a coworker picked one up and is evaluating it for a few weeks.
 I took a quick look and while it is pretty basic in design, it overall looks and feels like a nice laptop. Light, good keyboard and trackpad, 3:2 display (glossy but the new ones can be ordered mat), open with one finger, P series processors, and the interchangeable USBC ports is pretty slick. Top it off everything can be changed or upgraded easily.
 Downsides are there is just one size, but a 16" coming later this year, no TB ports, battery life is meh at 5-6 hours, and fans can spin up when under load.
 Curious if anyone has used these at scale or any feedback on them? It sort of reminds of a generic laptop but with a decent build quality.

 I'm going for cybersecurity and if all goes to plan, more networking stuff that was not available during my first school career.

 I came away feeling like they likely have lots of technical debt but based mainly on the perl comment. Are people still writing in perl much?

 I'm wondering whether anyone has experience with Allied telesis and knows how to configure a WAN failover? On Cisco, I would configure an IP SLA, but this doesn't seem to be an option on AT. Is there a way, or do I have to load balance?
 I've never used Allied Telesis before so this is new to me. I've done some googling but there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of resources out there for this brand. The Allied telesis documentation is extensive, but hard to navigate, so I wouldn't be surprised if I just didn't find the correct document on how to do this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While looking at all these jobs posting for in-person work (while I'm already happily employed), I've realized a big question looms:
 What's the price differential that it would take for me to return to full-time in-person work from remote?
 I'm not really worried about people that are saying "I'll never do it", since you're already staking a claim outside the conversation. I'm more curious for those who would consider it (like me), and what factors you'd weigh into the value of that work. I'm obviously considering equal factors with work environment, on-call, benefits packages, etc.
 I think my absolute minimum looks something like this:
 ((Time To Get Ready in AM) + (Commute Time Round Trip)) * Approximate OT Hourly Rate * 250 work days PLUS vehicle costs for that year.
 So for example, a $72k remote job, to move in person with a 30 minute commute each way would really need:
 ((1 hour + 1 hour) * 54 * 250) + (($400 car payment + $100 insurance + $100 gas)*12)
 $34.2k more, or $106,200 total. Even then, I might be able to find that same $72k remote for $95-100k remote and maintain my valuable personal time.
 What about you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm encountering a strange problem with TACACS+ that I've never seen before (or at least never noticed). When an incorrect password is entered on a client device I would expect a 'Password:' request message to be sent by the TACACS+ server, a reply from the client containing the password, and then a 'password incorrect' message back from the server. This does indeed happen, but then immeadiately afterward the client sends the password for a second time, despite me only having entered it once. This goes to happen a further two times before the server eventually sends a 'authentication failed' and it all stops. Resulting in a total of 4 messages being sent by the client containing the password (again at this point I have only entered it once). 
 This wouldn't normally be a problem except we are authenticating TACACS against AD, which locks out users after 3 incorrect password attempts. Because the TACACS+ client sends the password a total of 4 times, the users is immidiately locked out of their AD account if they enter their password incorrectly just once.
 I'm seeing the same behavoir on both Nokia and Juniper (mx, srx, qfx) clients, and have now replicated it in a lab using a completely different TACACS+ server (TACGUI) and the junos olive image. I'm also very confident it is not the SSH client as it happens with putty, secureCRT, mobaXterm, and the buildin ssh client on a Linux box.
 I'm really stumped as to what is causing these clients to send the password a total or four times, even though it has already been rejected, and the user is not entering it again. Is this expected behavoir? Can I stop it? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
 Regards,
 Frustrated Network Engineer

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious about best practice opinions:
 Common scenario - multiple sites linked together by IPSec tunnels, segmentation firewalls, you name it. You need to allow traffic from machine A to machine B, and that passes through firewalls X, Y, and Z.
 Do you:
  
Create matching firewall policies on all devices, restricting source/dst IP & port
 Create one restrictive policy on the firewall closest to traffic source (machine A), and looser 'catch-all' rules on the other firewalls
 Create one restrictive policy on the firewall closest to traffic destination (machine B) and looser 'catch-all' rules on the other firewalls.
  
To me, "1." feels most secure, but 2 feels like the best balance between security (block bad traffic before it hits anything else in the network) and not having to triple my work.
 Thoughts?

 I'm trying to setup OSPF in a linux-lab using FRR/Quagga where I have the need to separate two areas but everything I've thrown at it thus far has failed - Anyone out there has any experience implementing an inter-area filter? It appears it's not an unheard of functionality (see this post: https://packetlife.net/blog/2010/feb/10/ospf-filtering-inter-area-vs-intra-area/) but I haven't successfully managed to implement the filter-list parameter thus far...
 It would also appear that the received wisdom of the internet would be that in case you're in need of route filtering, BGP would be the preferred setup but I'll be running that as an external protocol and would, for curiosity's sake, prefer not to implement it as an internal protocol. :)
 Any assistance would be appreciated. Surrender is definitely an option.

 Is there some routing somewhere in Azure that can be modified to allow this traffic? Capturing traffic at the firewall, I can see traffic exiting the firewall on the tunnel interface to Azure, but nothing in reply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I'm not starting from Zero XP. I've been in and around the IT field for the last 11 years, but this is a bigger jump than what I was expecting. Instead of just applying for jobs at my current level I've always tried to apply for jobs that will stretch my current skills.
 -Because of events beyond my control, agressive resume polishing, and one company's desperate need to hire someone I am now the recipient of a paycheck more than twice the size of my last one and a Senior Engineer Level IT title. How do I go about not fucking this up?
 Edit #2: this is some of what I did previously...
 SSL cert updates
 Set up scheduled task with PowerShell scripts,
 IIS configuration
 Configured SCCM update roll outs
 Configuration management
 managing production servers
 Set-up Azure VDI
 Group policy management
 ​
 Edit #3: the new position seems to be heavy on cloud platforms, some scripting, and project work, my last job was project heavy so nothing new there. I've done some cloud stuff so fingers crossed there. My scripts are low shelf but mostly functional.

 I was wondering if there are any good next steps I should follow.
 Our team has uninstalled the desktop app from all our endpoints, but is there more we should be doing?
 Wondering if any updates have been put out on what cyber security teams should do to make sure there hasn't been further compromise.
 Any advice or anything thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The renewal of the data centre is imminent and this will result in some changes. Currently, all gateways of the DC Vlans are on the firewall. With the new design, we are considering whether to change this. The datacenter core will be formed by a vPC Nexus pair. The consideration is then to transfer all SVIs ( with HRSP) to the Nexus pair. ospf should then announce the routes to the Nexthop router (firewall) and vice versa. In this way, the north-south traffic can be regulated and monitored via the firewall.
 The question now is: how can I handle the east-west traffic? InterVlan communication can then no longer be monitored and regulated. One possible solution would be to use VRFs on the Nexus switches. These are then routed to the firewall via a separate transfer network.
 At the moment, the throughput of the firewall is not a problem, but since we can connect servers with higher speed due to the new hardware, there could be an increase.
 What is the best way to implement this in the data centre in terms of security? How do you do it? Maybe someone can give me some comments and recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this is better here or on a linux sub. I wanted to try here first because I think the issue is more about routes than linux. Can anyone spot an issue with my routing?
 I'm trying to set up a web app on a centos box. There are two nics, both have addresses in the dmz and the same gateway. eth1 is nat'ed to a public IP address. eth0 is used for inside traffic only. I've verified the needed ports are open to the outside using powershell Test-NetConnection. The issue is that on the outside the page hangs and then times out. On the inside lan it loads fine. 
 Initially it was the opposite. Page would load only on the internet, I added an internal route and now internal lan is the only one that works.
 I can ping inside and outside addresses from both nics. I used ifdown and ifup to verify them one at a time.
 Can anyone spot an issue that would cause outside requests to not receive a response?
 Internal design:
 10.2.1.0/24 - internal lan
 10.1.1.0/23 - dmz
 10.1.1.1 - dmz gateway
 10.1.1.54 - eth0 to internal network
 10.1.1.55 - eth1 nat'ed to public ip
 ​
 Results from "ip route" command:
 default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth1 proto static metric 101 
 10.1.1.0/23 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.1.54 metric 100 
 10.1.1.0/23 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.1.55 metric 101 
 10.2.1.0/24 via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0 proto static metric 100

 What is going on up there that requires such a dangerous task? I was just watching a video about people falling from cell towers and wonder what requires them to climb up there. I understand maybe failing equipment replacement, but are there other things that require regularly climbing up to the top?

 So I may go the way and just scramble all names and addresses. Anny ideas or a way to approach this different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this question isn't super high level, but it's a bit more complex than r/iphone would be able to help with. 
 At my job we had a bunch of iPhone users lose a good portion of their contacts. We have corporate Gmail and originally their email/calendar/contacts were set up in iOS Mail using Activesync. Everyone assumed that this information was a 2-way sync, i.e. for example a contact entered manually on the phone would automatically sync up to the cloud, and any change they made in the cloud contacts would sync down to the phone. Seems like this was not the case though and manually-entered contacts were only getting stored locally on the phone, yet they were still attached to the contact list associated to the Activesync account.
 Recently the Messaging Team decided to phase this out and have everyone use the Gmail app instead. Problem is someone accidentally cut off the Activesync access before End User Support had a chance to migrate their data. Users started getting a persistent prompt to update their password, but this didn't work because the account was gone from the system essentially. People got fed up and just deleted the account, this process does not offer any option to keep stored contacts, you have the ability to either Erase or Cancel.
 Now in the texts and other apps there are phone numbers with no name attached. In some cases it's hundreds/thousands of contacts. Is there any recourse to get these back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company recently experienced its second data breach in the past six months. All the information I’ve received so far is hearsay, but it seems that upper management is considering outsourcing security to a third party company and firing the internal security team. It’s been almost two weeks since the incident stopped, but we are all somehow still employed.
 The team was advised by the C-Suite that we are primary witnesses to the incident and that we may be involved in the litigation process from customers. It seems that I may be questioned by lawyers in the future based on my testimony. We have been asked to prepare a statement and timeline of the work we have completed near the incident.
 I’ve completely given up on having any future with this company and I am doing just what I need to do to stay on payroll as long as possible while I look for another job. I do not trust anything my employer says/does.
 Has anyone ever had to testify on behalf of their company? Do I really have to? 
 Would the statement I create affect my future unemployment claim? Also, if this goes legal, does this mean my job has a reason to keep me on payroll longer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a customer running QuickBooks 2023 on a RDS that is also a DC. I know it isn't ideal, but its a single-server environment. Its also a hosted VM. If you are one of those "QB doesn't work on a VM" people, please do not respond to this thread. It normally works fine, I have many customers on this scenario, including other DC/RDS combo VMs and the only issue is the conflict with the DNS server service. 
 Anyone familiar with this topic knows there are two fixes to the service conflict:
 1 - netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange commands
 2 - script having the QuickBooksDB## service start BEFORE the DNS Server service
 ​
 OK, so hopefully we're on the same page here. Now to the NEW issue.
 For this customer, an earlier version of QuickBooks was working fine with the script-service-start-order workaround, for years. Then we upgrade to QuickBooks 2023. I know the number in the service name changed, I accounted for that. 
 The new issue with QB2023 is not that the QuickBooksDB33 service doesn't start - it does. The issue is severe slowness in the QuickBooks program when the DNS Server service is running. Stop that service, QuickBooks runs well again. I have tried the excludedportrange commands (yes for the dynamic port listed in Database Service Manager) and port 8019, both TCP and UDP. I have tried the "starting services in the proper order" workaround, this does not work either. 
 I've researched and beat up on this issue for hours. Asking other Redditors is my last attempt before telling the customer they need two hosted servers so I can move the AD roles and DNS off of the RDS. Has anyone else experienced this with specifically QuickBooks 2023 on a DC?

 What is the best platform to learn EVPN on in a virtual environment? I was thinking I should get some cisco CSRv's going but this can get rather resource intensive.
 Is there a better alternative to learning EVPN on a virtual platform? Preferably cisco, but I am open to alternatives.
 I have had a setup with Cumulus networks and their virtual appliance, but the problem there was the fact that in my opinion it's a very niche player with little adoption in the real world.
 Preferably something that can be run in VMWare or EVE-NG, if at all possible.
 Any recommendations?

 So Server 2012R2 is still occasionally receiving Edge and Chrome updates to the 109 build.
 The last one was 7 days ago, and they will continue until Oct EOL (or hopefully longer through the ESU period)
 https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=edge%20109.0.1518.95 
 So nessus is still reporting that we need to go to the latest version (which isn't possible on 2012R2), it seems to ignore these 109 security updates which are clearly combating new critical vulnerabilities. The trouble is, Microsoft doesn't seem to give any details on these stealth 109 updates and what CVE's they resolve.
 Is this ultimately a nessus reporting issue or a MS one - in regards to the lack of information about 109 updates and how they are managed/logged in the future?

(Billing app was made by his "IT genius" son that works as a music teacher and his app is a pile of crap). I explained to him multiple times that this server is the best we can do for free (Intel Xeon E3-1245v5, 32 GB ram, 1tb hdd) and we are not gonna spend months analyzing the crappy code his son made to fix it for free. But he just wont understand and keeps calling and annoying us. This morning he called and asked "Why is my server so slow ?" Im just done being serious with this customer so I told him I dont know he has to call Microsoft and then i pretended I couldnt hear him anymore and I hanged up and didnt picked up his next calls lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I have a probably simple question about IP address management but I am very new to networking so I am grateful for answers.
 So if I have a Class C network e.g. 192.168.0.0 with all kind of devices (notebooks, printers, IoT etc). Is it good enough to give static IPs to some devices on my DHCP server and leave the rest dynamically allocated or is it recommended to also use subnets e.g. with subnet mask 255.255.254.0 to then potentially have 4 subnets
 192.168.0.0/26 192.168.0.128/26 192.168.1.0/26 192.168.1.128/26
 so I can give devices in different subnets? What would be the advantages of that? Is this more secure and faster? Or am I thinking wrong and I do need VLANs to have those advantages? I know I can use both in that they do not exclude each other because they act on different layers. But other then that I am a little confused.
 I am very helpful for any links and resources to learn more about this topic or any hints what is best to do. I am not fully understanding the implications here yet I guess.
 Many thanks in advance!

 Checking, those devices are all Windows Server 2016.
 Looking in intune I noticed that I've done a configuration profile for it some time ago but in each of those devices the configuration result as "non applicable".
 So I've spent a good 15 minutes googling for the cause and find some workaround.
 On MS site I didn't find nothing meaningfull rapidly so.... I switched tab to chatGPT and I've asked him (or her) about this behaviour.
 The answer has been quite rapid and usefull. I'll not past it here cause it out of the scope of this post.
 ​
 And this is only an example. Let's say, I know it is good for programming, but I've used it also for commercial support like:
 ChatGPT what are some switch models that meet this requirements ?Can you suggest me more models ?Ok, now, from all the models you have suggested me, what is the cheaper ?
 Before it I know I would have done a lot of google search here and there and then amazon or google shopping to find some prices indications ...

 We're currently in the process of moving away from Sophos to Microsoft 365 Defender for all of our fleet, and my question is whether I am able to combine onboarding methods without running into any issues? 
 Current thinking is to continue onboarding via SCCM and Intune, but then I'm hopng to also deploy a GPO to catch any machines that aren't communicating back, or for those servers and other edge cases that have been kept off management systems intentionally. In these instances, the GPO would likely hit machines that have already been onboarded via one of the methods above. Has anybody run into any issues doing it that way?
 Side question... for the "local script" onboarding method, Microsoft states that it has been optimised for ten machines only, due to some settings that expidite telemetry data from the machines, so suitable for pilot groups only. Is there a version of this that I can run that would just onboard them with the standard settings in the other packages? My google skills appear to be lacking...
 Thanks all! May your Friday be peaceful.

 After that, the start menu wasn't working and OneNote for Windows 10 wouldn't load.
 I tried registry fixes, Powershell scripts but nothing worked but...
 it was HP Wolf Security. The user had it installed for 3 months and it just now started being a problem after the update.
 So to anyone who is looking for a potential fix - it might be that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Recently in our Win11 estate (latest versions via GPO) has started to 'lose' user files and folders in the OS. These have been discovered in TreeSize (run as local admin) in hidden folders named 'found.000', 'found.001' etc. These directories are not visible to the OS even with hidden folders enabled. In some instances, it's possible to cut/paste files back to the original locations (with associated integrity checks) but in other cases there are several TBs of files and folders lost and in most cases renamed with an appended number.
 I understand that these are chkdisk fragmented files or they have been moved by chkdisk. Is there a method or utility to restore these files and directories and 'fix' the issues that chkdisk identified without a manual trawl through?
 The scale is such that I would consider a commercial software solution.
 Many thanks.

 I am looking for some assistance in an issue we've had for a while where I work. I'll try and describe it as best as I can not to waste your time.
 ​
 We have been experiencing issues with websites timing out for a while now. It is sporadic and doesn't happen on any particular websites. It can be one website sometimes, then it works fine 5 minutes after, and then five minutes after the website working before, times out now. One thing that seems consistent is when a website times out, it seems to be able to load afterwards.
 ​
 There is no real other network impact, internal seems to be fine, servers seem to be running fine internally. 
 Pinging is no issue, NSlookup is no issue.
 I've noticed that when trying to load a website, it may be very slow but connecting anyway. In Devtools it will have a stalled time on 15+ seconds and the rest seems perfectly fine.
 We have a setup of 4 MS250, 2 MS425, 2 MX84. Everything is completely firmware updated and have tried restarts just to make sure. 
 We've had 2 different network consultants come and have a look at it, with no luck. I've written to our ISP but the issue seems to be non existent when connecting directly to our Edge router, so they're positive the issue is at our end, and the consultants are positive the issue is at the ISP end. 
 We are at a loss, and this is why I turn to reddit in my final hour of sanity. To hopefully find the hero who has the answer to my prayers.
 Thank you.

 I'm watching the debug logs and I'm confused as to what I'm seeing. Here's the text dump: https://pastebin.com/4buTg5sJ
 From what I can see, do I have a couple of clients on VLAN 19, that are already assigned IPs of 10.1.19.182 and 10.1.19.166, that are still continually requesting new IP addresses multiple times a second?
 Or is something else going on here?

Other then that I basically replaced keyboards, dealt with end users, changes ink cartridges, and did some phone VOIP zoom provisioning.

We recently combined with another company in another state. They have Palo Alto HA and we have Sophos HA. Replacing our 13 year old Sophos is on the table. We'd also like a better VPN system. We use OpenVPN (hate the DNS registration issues because of separate DHCP, etc). They use Global Protect which doesn't stay connected at the logon screen when switching users. We'd love to get a better VPN system as well but I don't think we want a subscription based hardware device, etc.
  
Are there any alternatives to VPN that would allow an application to communicate through an office network and across the vendor T1 line? Zero Trust is such a buzz word but I don't think any of the turn key solutions work for this.
 If VPN is still needed, what is the best option these days?
 Should we keep users split to connect to their closest office 100/100?

I am fairly new to networking.(migrated from helpdesk)) One of my tasks is to clean the configuration of branch office routers. Most of them have outdated configs, especially regarding zone-based firewall rules. Now I am trying to go through all routers and to understand how they were designed(from a zone-based firewall perspective)(there is no proper documentation - so I have to reverse engineer this thing) . Is there any easier way to do this? Most of the time I end up with paper and a pan and I try to do draw a scheme. Any suggestions? Is there software out there that can map this stuff.? I could suggest buying it if it would provide a better way to document everything.

 If the traffic in the reverse direction has no marking, how does our network on the return trip know to prioritize it? If it's supposed to be marked from their cloud systems back to us for prioritization it's essentially not being prioritized from them to us. Is this the right logic? Please drop some insight, it would be appreciated.

 The issue is often electricians will undercut our prices, sometimes just the convenience of a single supplier doing both electrics and structured data cabling at the same time is the desirable factor.

 I actually assumed everything is ok until the senior came in from holiday to see that I messed something up. All the sales people were freaking out and I suspect tomorrow I might be having some conversations. They were calling some other vendors to see if they have issues on their end and even our director got involved. For the first time I felt true outage panic mode and I suspected it would be my fault, which only made it worse.
 I knew something like this would eventually happen, this is a lesson I’m not forgetting any time soon. Looking forward to more fails and more lessons though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/sysadmin,
 I'm in a bit of a dilemma here and I'm hoping to get some advice from the community. I've been tasked with data migration in SharePoint online sites, initially the "guru" admin said automation is not possible and we've all concluded that I can do this in 3-4 months, and during a couple of weeks, I was able to create a small script that can almost automate the entire process. With this script, I could move thousands of sites in just a few days, possibly even over a weekend.
 Here's my problem: I'm not sure if I should tell my boss about this script or not. On one hand, it could save the company a lot of time and resources, and I believe it's something they should know. On the other hand, I don't want to risk getting only a pat on the back for all my hard work.
 So my question is, should I tell my boss about my script? And if I do, how do I approach the conversation and ask for some sort of bonus or remuneration for my efforts?
 Some important context that I've missed out:
  
I work for a subsidiary company, they pay me and my salary is almost x3 time bigger than it was a year ago
 Theres an ongoing discussion of invoicing my time for the parent company since I've already helped them a lot and they realised that they need me. The boss I'm talking about is the lead IT from the parent company

Granted he's pretty good at tricking out his desktop theme but his 'ideas' are usually VERY bad. In this weeks drama, I have setup our DNS servers with load balancing and a 5 second health check. Boss wants to set our TTL to 6 seconds with the argument people using the site wouldn't notice the 5 second outage before the LB updates and we can be more nimble with DNS changes.
 Next up is a project manager that wants the TTL set to 12 hours so we can fix any DNS issues before anybody notices.
 I have spent 3 hours in a meeting with both of them trying explain why we want longer ttl than 6 seconds, but less than 12 hours. Once I address the ttl that's too short, the other says "great, set it at 12 hours". Then while I'm explaining why we want it less than 12 hours, the other says "great, 6 seconds",
 It's currently at 10 min because the PM's project makes alot of changes to their site and want the changes to take immediate effect for all of the public, but doesn't understand that the 12 hour TTL is completely opposite of that.
 The EE doesn't understand the additional latency of clients having fresh dns queries every 6 seconds. 
 They are wearing me down and one of the stupid ideas is going to win.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having an issue with a Ruckus 7750. I'm attempting to place ACLs inbound and outbound on all my VLANs, but I keep running into an error that there aren't enough hardware resources. In talking to Ruckus support, it came to light that the hardware limits on outbound ACLs are much tighter than inbound ACLs. In the Ruckus world (not sure if this applies to other brands as well) inbound means traffic going into the switch from the VLAN and outbound means going into the VLAN from the switch which brings me to my question...
 Is it normal or best practice to have ACLs on each VLAN in both directions? It seemed like the most secure thing to do to me, but if switches are built with more resources available for inbound ACLs (from the VLAN to the switch), is it best practice to only use inbound ACLs? Are these Ruckus switches just garbage?
 Any help on this would be appreciated. I did do some Googling before posting here but didn't come up with much.

 A contractor left the firm and their mailbox was converted to shared and licenses removed. When they rejoined their sign in was unblocked and licenses restored however their shared mailbox was not converted back. Thus they have a mailbox in the normal admin 365 view but in exchange their mailbox shows up as shared. 
 How can I be sure these are the same mailboxes ? Or does he now have two sets ? I want to convert back to regular without affecting the user. The mailbox sizes are slightly different 300kb or so. 
 I’ll do some testing and figure it out anyway but just thought it was interesting and curious if anyone has done this before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 We use BatchPatch in combination with WSUS to handle patching of Windows Servers in our environment.
 After applying the latest patches we have seen some strange behavior relating to the recent enforcement of the DCOM changes.
 We have multiple subnets where a standalone BatchPatch "server" resides in each subnet.
 In one of the environments the BatchPatch server is unable to Check for updates, see CPU usage and so on after applying the latest updates. The target servers return the WMI Access Denied error.
 In another environment Batchpatch is able to Check for updates, see CPU usage etc.
 Using winver to check the build number, the build number is identical on the BatchPatch servers and the target servers in both environments. Windows Firewall configuration is identical, the servers are even part of the same domain, have the same GPOs applied etc.
 We have three questions and would appreciate any feedback on either one:
  
Is there something we can do to make BatchPatch continue to work? We thought it was the vendor's responsibility to make sure that their tools continue to work post DCOM hardening. And it does work, in one of the subnets as per BatchPatch documentation.
 If there is something we can do, should we avoid that due to security concerns? 
 Are there any other tools for Patch Management you recommend that work 100% post DCOM hardening? Preferably in-house/on-prem tools due to legal constraints. Must be able to schedule when the Servers reboot, automatic reboots are out of the question. The tool should preferably be agent-less but if agents are the only way (or a much better way) we'll go with anything that works. 
  
Thanks in advance!

So we get X amount of GBs per month. If we use them up we need to purchase more (that's expensive af!). I have a Fortigate 100E which does all the content filtering. Students access the Internet and internal resources through a Aruba 505 cluster.
 We have enough data quota but these kids are using different kinds of VPN software to circumvent firewall restrictions. Before you ask, I have blocked all these in multiple levels (application filter, Web filter, and DNS filter). The only opened ports for them are 443, 80, and few other ports for internal systems. This setup blocks all well-known VPNs and proxy tools. But these teenage buggers always find some crappy VPN app or a proxy site that is conveniently not included in Fortigate blacklists. I usually monitor the usage patterns and identify these. Then I block them manually. It has been a game of whack-a-mole for a long time and I am getting tired. How do ya'll block these kinds of things? Is there any one-off way to do this? (policies are already in place but it's really hard to make teenagers comply with them. So before you say it, no I cannot just scare them into not using VPNs).

 The one and only reason I can think about is to be able to route a /32 public address in order to save a limited pool of addresses.
 Some might algo point that by doing it with a private prefix you don't open your gateway to the internet, but given that usually all switches/routers have firewall is this really a security measure now a days? If you think from a DDoS point of view, sure, you'll be able to target that equipment with a public address, however, with a private prefix set, one you can target the client and all the traffic would still go through the gateway anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, couldnt find any other place to ask this question.
 TL;DR; Competitors sending abuses on our IP's/domains for no reason. Hosting provider said its not a problem since those abuse emails are stupid and pointless and we did nothing wrong but they legaly should have a response from me and forward it.
 So we have a 3 basic servers, one for database, two for web application. Database is closed for internet, only available localy and web applications only 80 port. I have a openvpn server on smallest vps just to have an access to servers 22 by ssh and marketing guy could have an access to database directly (Before you will scream - the guy knows what is he doing and his user have only read access on sales table). So yesterday he visited competitors website to check their prices (literally clicked 1 link and left) and they sent abuse email that someone from our network IP visited their website ONCE and he wasnt on site for 30+ secs so search engine thought it was a bad visit and could derank their website. It's not a problem for this case, but they sending abuses on weekly basis like we have pirated scripts (that I wrote myself, just some JS popups), non licensed windows (but our servers are linux based), etc.
 We cant go against them in legal field since their legal entity placed in different country and just not worth it. 
 What can we do or there any option to report it somewhere that they are sending abuse mails with no reason?
 Thank you!

 I hope someone can help me here with this issue I can't wrap my head araound any more.
 The problem is basically:
 Some domain users can enter admin-credentials when asked for but are stuck on a blackish screen after that. It stays for several minutes until it times out and nothing happens after that.
 Logging off or shutting down doesn't work as well for those users. It stays at the screen "shutting down" or "logging off".
 Gpupdate fails after several minutes with a timeout for userpolicy. There are no errors for this in eventlog.
 When logged in with a different user, everything works just fine and some users don't have the same problems on all their pcs, however some got a new pc and the issues came back. 
 I'm running AD on-prem, the users don't have much in common except being domain-users. 
 Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

 I try to wrap my head around why and how the default language for a new Mailbox is influenced. My guess is, it's probably not necessary to change the language manually every time a mailbox was created automatically. 
 Right now, we log into the usermailbox via web and set the language manually. Powershell via the set-mailboxfolderregionalconfiguration cmdlet is also an option. But I can't find a way to set, e.g. a policy for it or a tenant wide default setting. 
 Anyone here already figured it out, or am I hunting ghosts here?

 So we run both Nessus and M365 Defender scans across or estate. Nessus has identified a few machines runing an app which includes Log4J-1.2.8.jar. However the supplier states their system is not vulnerable to attack. My assumption with this is that the app doesn't use it in the live environment and maybe it was used during development for logging... but why include it in the deployment??? 
 Anyway... 
 My understanding was that if it exists on a device it has the potential to be exploited. Is this understanding correct? 
 I have our App Support asking the suppliers if it is not used, whether we can remove it without issue / voiding warranty / support. 
 Just after some clarity as to vulnerability really.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotta start off with that I'm kinda ashamed to post this but google isn't helping me out at all. So what's the problem:
 In W11 if I open certain application, i can't use other applications/functions like using my browser. I can scroll in my browser but I can't type, open a new tab or even click on a page. The focus is fully on that application. If i minize the application, i can once again use my browser (or file explorer etc.). This is on my home pc. I learned to live with it since there is a workaround. Since I couldn't find a fix i thought maybe it was a "feature" of W11 and stopped researching it. 
 Now i don't know when it happened but I'm now having the same issue on my work laptop which runs on W10. Once I open up PowerShell ISE, the focus gets locked on it and i can't perform any other actions, wether that is opening file explorer or just browsing the internet. I can scroll through whatever is open but that's it. 
 It isn't focus mode (which seems to do something entirely else) and this is really disturbing my ability to perform my work. If i Google Windows locks browser, i get shit about locked screen sigh...
 What in god's name is going on here? Why are certain applications getting "on top", stealing focus and Ms/kb input? Any suggestions are welcome!
 Edit: Ctrl+spacebar doesn't fix it btw.

 I dont quite understand how i can solve the issue that the sql native client 2012 is out of support.
 Due to this Microsoft Article the client was deprecated in june 2022. But here it says, thats bundled with the SQL Server version.
 I have some "older" SQL Server like 2012 and 2014 where ne native client was the latest. But with a new installed SQL 2019 the client was installed. SSMS 19 is installed too. 
 I cannot uninstall the client via the system, because it tells me that some things could broken. 
 So, how do you solve this problem? Its just from an admin perspective not from a dev.

ansible ad hoc copy the file /etc/ohgawd.key from remote server called tsrv01 present in inventory file tsrvs to local machine's temp director. the ansible user is bob and is present on both machines using ssh keys with passwordless sudo on the target machine.
  
The result:
 ansible tsrv01 -i tsrvs -m copy -a "src=/etc/ohgawd.key dest=/tmp" --user=bob --private-key=/path/to/ssh/key --become --become-user=root --ask-become-pass --extra-vars 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3' --connection=ssh 
 How I'd do it:
 ansible tsrv01 -m fetch -a 'src=/etc/ohgawd.key dest=/tmp/ohgawd.key' -i tsrvs -b 
 This is a pretty simple task. in this case the process of making the chatgpt ad hoc command work is a hassle. tried coaxing it towards what I wanted but without any better results. And it seems spending a lot of time doing that is a waste compared to just doing it properly yourself. Or googling. 
 So, you still gotta know a little something about what you're doing.

 I don't get any output. According to the Windows Updates GUI KB5002316 is already installed. 
 If I use Get-HotFix -id KB5002316 I get a message saying the hotfix is not installed. Even though the Windows update GUI says the opposite. 
 What's the dealio? I'm confused

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I just inherited two Apache Tomcat Installations (prod and test) running on Windows Server. Since installation was done in a couple of years they received since then zero updates and running diffrent versions (9.0.31 on test and 9.0.27 on prod). Before adjusting the tomcat config itself (Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1, disable weak ciphers etc.) I would like to allign the Tomcat Versions and update them to version 9.0.73. 
 I found a couple of different ways how to do this minor update and would like to receive your feedback.
 First Approach Idea: 
  
Backup current configuration
 Remove the complete tomcat installation
 Install the new version from scratch
 Adjust configs like server.xml, web.xml etc.
 Copy from backup the relevant webapps / certificates etc.
  
Second Approach idea:
  
Backup current configuration
 Replace only the files inside the folders /bin and /lib folders
 Don't touch the rest of the config .xml Files
  
I found various diffrent approaches online from diffrent vendors and now i am litle bit uncertain how the "correct" approach would look like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm working with a network that has multiple VRFs which communicate with each other. We're considering doing some BGP aggregation.
 My question is, when we're doing BGP aggregation in this type of scenario, should we be aggregating closer to the source network? Or is there no real best practice or recommendation for where to aggregate?
 To provide some context, we have two VRFs - VRF A and VRF B - that are leaking together, and we want to aggregate some subnets from VRF A to some peer on VRF B.
 Any insights or recommendations on the best way to approach this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 I have a question about VPLS networks and the potential risks they may face. Specifically, I'm wondering if a VPLS network that only has routers on it can be at risk if it face a L2 storm (Multicast or Broadcast) ?
 Could it potentially impact all the routers on the network? Or is there some built-in mechanism that would prevent this from happening?
 I would appreciate any insights or expertise on this topic. Thank you!

 So we have 1 user complaining about slow wifi (for our guest wifi) and there are about 5 APs on this site. Slowness observed while surfing the web on phone/laptop while connected to wifi.
 He is in a remote site which doesn't have too many users and is connected via layer 3 Verizon epl back to our main site.
 He says he roams around say about 30-40 ft from his desk and it is still slow. Tried rebooting the AP that he was connected to (which I was able to see from the controller) which didn't help.
 His ethernet connection (Ethernet cable connected directly to laptop) works fine so I'm guessing it has to do with the APs themselves.
 What other troubleshooting steps can I look into to diagnose the cause?
 Probably have to look into the gui of the wlc I'm guessing.
 Also we upgraded the wlc from 8.1 to 8.3 about 2 weeks back and he says the wifi has been working slow ever since then.
 Right now we have only 1 wlc functioning in standalone which used to be 2 wlcs in an active standby pair before the upgrade as we ran into some complications. Will attempt to upgrade the other wlc tomorrow with Cisco support and get them back to the active standby cluster setup as it was originally. Don't think the wlc being in standalone could be causing any issues though as we have 40 other APs (also upgraded to 8.3) and have no issues with those in terms of speed of browsing for clients, etc.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE: The issue turned out to be FEC (Forward Error Correction). Setting it to off on the FS switch solved the issue.
 Devices involved: MikroTik ccr2216-1g-12xs-2xq router + FS.com N8560-48BC switch
 Cables:
  
FS.com S28-PC01 (Cisco coded)
 
FS.com S28-PC02 (Cisco coded)
 
Mikrotik XS+DA0001
 
Unspecified DAC from our DC
 
FS.com SFPP-PC02 (Cisco coded)
 
 Issue:
 Both the MikroTik and the FS.com switch consistently see the transceivers for each DAC cable. 
 However, no link is ever established. When a connection is made in loopback (from router to router or switch to switch) with these same cables, they seem to come up just fine, so cable compatibility should be okay, but it's like the FS switch or the MikroTik just don't care that they should be connecting.
 Tried the following:
  
Setting negotiation to off on both sides + setting duplex and speed manually
 Leaving negotiation on and everything negotiating
 Forcing transceiver type on the FS switch transceiver 25GBASE-COPPER
 Rebooting the switch at various points, rebooting the router at various points
 Upgrading the MikroTik firmware
 (TODO) Upgrade the firmware on the FS switch
 All the different cables specified
 Setting VLANs on both sides

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/sysadmin!
 Just wanted to send a heads up about potential post-exploitation activity sourcing from 3CX Phone System’s desktop application due to automated updates that was reported by CrowdStrike through Reddit, Inc. 
 The original post can be seen here:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/125r3uu/20230329_situational_awareness_crowdstrike/
 Our SOC has observed indicators of SentinelOne quarantining 3CXDesktopApp.exe and Update.exe on March 22nd and will continue to track this as the situation develops further.
 While our SOC has observed quarantines, the good news is that Blackpoint has found no evidence of further malicious activity, successful beacons or post-exploitation commands observed.
 How to Mitigate: 
 - Uninstall 3CX from all machines until the situation is resolved 
 - If uninstalling is not a viable option, then ensure the 3CX is a version prior to 18.12.4xx for Windows and 18.11.X for Mac. 
 - In addition, check firewall records for callouts to the domains in the above report by CrowdStrike

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m asking because I’ve noticed a recurring issue with all US-based ISPs periodically losing all DNS information for an entire TLD, and all domains on that TLD (including mine) appear to vanish and go offline. 
 Ping, nsloookup, and dig can’t resolve the domain to an IP. The entire TLD is gone, while all other domains remain online. 
 Multiple third-party products, tools, and services confirm that the entire TLD ceases to exist for several hours at a time, which is very puzzling. Many alerts and notifications from our vendors arrive when this happens. 
 I’ve reached out to ICANN for some information, but they are apparently not an authority for this TLD (it’s one of the newer ones that’s country-specific). 
 The registry for the domain says there’s no issue, but they aren’t testing through any US-based ISPs. My offshore team can still access our infrastructure, while myself and all our US-based customers cannot. 
 The registry’s website is also offline to all US-based traffic when this happens, since it uses the same TLD (*.et). Sites like downforeveryoneorjustme.com show their site as down when this happens. 
 Very strange. Not sure where to look for answers. Thanks!
 Update: I’m realizing that troubleshooting this issue will require more experienced folks in networking. Terms like Bogon Routes, Looking Glass, ASN, IANA, and others mentioned here are new to me. If you’re particularly experienced in this space and are available for some consulting, or on-call emergency troubleshooting next time it happens, please send me a DM. I’d like to assemble a small group that can help get to the bottom of this US-only ISP / TLD issue. Many thanks to everyone that’s commented here.

 Now that I look at the blueprints of the specialization exams I see a huge overlap with DEVCOR. Some of them lean towards domain-specific Cisco products (NSO for SP, UCI for DC, etc) but the 300-910 DEVOPS seems to be a subset of DEVCOR, maybe with a bit more of Kubernetes (well, probably, but anyway).
 Am I underestimating the exams (and especially 300-910 DEVOPS) or are they really just meme exams to milk us for $300?

 ​
 we are in the process of evaluating Elasticflow. im setting up a vm and sending netflow v9 data to the elasticflow vm. i dont know too much about elasticflow but so far im liking it. 
 ​
 elastic flow base their prices on flows per second. now my question is where does everyone usually enable netflow with this in mind? should i enable netflow only on our core routers? should i do it also on user access switches as well? 
 ​
 i was thinking to get the best price maybe to only enable netflow on our core routers and not so much on the access switches. im sorry that this is a very vague question im still in the process of configuring it. 
 ​
 we are a cisco shop with ftds and routers internally. and if anyone has any opinions or tips on elasticflow and best practices on it i would appreciate it

 thank you!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in a couple of small ISPs and in this time have noticed two main types of networks using L3 switches:
  
All switches are in the same L2 network and are usually all in the same subnet.
 
Every switch has a specific /32 IP address on its loopback interface and every connection between these switches uses a /30 prefix for PTP on a specific VLAN.
 
 I've seen both of these scenarios using OSPF and don't know if the latter is a requirement for some kind of protocol, like MPLS. I've seen ISPs move from the first to the second scenario, but don't know why or even if this is good behavior.
 I'd assume that the latter would be more CPU intensive on the hardware and maybe add a disregardful amount of latency to the network, but what are the benefits?

 Question about Virtual Stackwise. Currently we have a single Core Switch that is running on the network. Trying to implement a secondary Core Switch to use as the Virtual Stackwise for redundancy. Primary Switch has all the configurations and I have implemented the stackwise configurations on it. On the Secondary Switch, I have implemented the stackwise-virtual and domain, SVL (learned that this is not needed in the Secondary Switch. Deleted them), and DAD link. The question is, will the Secondary Switch sync configurations that are on the Primary Switch?
 ​
 Also, how does the interface numbering work? We got 40 port CAT 9500s. Will Primary be numbered int range ten1/0/1 - 40 and secondary switch int range ten2/0/1 - 40?

 My organization is slowly moving to a new headquarters site over the next few years, which of course will entail setting up a new core. We have a temporary 3750 stack there now as we haven't gotten all of our equipment yet. The site is a six-story building (not including basement, where the core resides). IDF closets on each floor with layer 2 switches, 12 strands of fiber ran between each floor and the basement. Our current headquarters core is a chassis switch (Cat 4507), with port-channels to other buildings for layer 2 redundancy.
 I've read a bunch of posts here and elsewhere about best practice for core redundancy, and it seems like stacking (virtual stackwise in my case, as these will be 9500s) is generally considered to be less favorable to having separate management planes. What I haven't quite been able to nail down is what the right solution is to accommodate that is. I've been looking at VRRP, HSRP, and GLBP. For those with experience with any of those, which would you recommend and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 We‘re currently deploying fortiswitches at our campus and keep on getting issues with these switches. First we swapped our core layer to 1048Es. First burden was to add 4 switches to a MLAG. Its restricted to 2 switches. Then there was an issue with connecting both MlAG pair with each other. It created a loop, even tho configured as stated in their documentary and made everything to shit down. 
 Connecting distribution layer was a mess to. It looped again due to a bug with STP. Since you have no real centralized management, we had to troubleshoot on Firewall GUI, CLI and Switch CLI. You can completely forget about the Fortimanager integration. 
 Accsess layee integration got its own bugs. Since were running a split vendor environment right now, we had problems connecting the switches to the 1048Es 10gig lwl ports. Had to do some config adjustments on the old switches too. 
 Configuring these switches is verry „interesting“ too as Im used to CLI only. The CLI itself is nothing compared to Ciscos or Junipers. Though I like there firewall configuration, the switch controller GUI seems to be buggy as well. Some menues doesnt show all options so you have to increase window size to actually view everything. The topology view is buggy too as you cant even scroll in on large deployments. 
 Overall it has not been a pleasure dealing with this devices. Since we have over 2000 switches in general, I dont think this will be funny times. 
 Do you also have fortiswitches on your campus/dc and what is your opinion about them?

 I came across some readings of BGP in the Data Center, I'm pretty sure this may answer my first question. I find this very intriguing as I've never thought of BGP being used outside of ISPs. 
 I'm generally curious on the different design options being used. I tried searching for some info on AWS underlying architecture for the DC but it seems they don't really put that info out there. Would love to hear from anyone in r/networking who has dabbled into this area.

 Barracuda has left these devices out to die, seemingly. There are no updates forthcoming since a couple of years, according to my co-worker.
 A while ago, I looked at Titan and it was basically the same as Barracuda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, weird specific question: I checked the signal of my SFP module with an oscilloscope and saw that sometimes I have a pulse additional to the TTL signal I want to transmit, which is very unhandy, because I just want to count pulses with another device for my application, so basically just use the sfp as laser sending TTL pulses. Is this some sort of synchronisation pulse and is there any way to supress this via programming adapters etc?
 The module is "CWDM-SFP1G-ZX" from FS and the board is the "SFP experimenter board v2 kit" from sysmocom.
 Thanks in advance!

 We have our UPSs, of course, and we have a generator, but the generator is old doesnt always fire. Facilities has worked on it, and they can usually get it up in running in 20 minutes or less, which is fine for getting the offices working but not adequate for keeping everything from going down. We are getting ready to start major construction, so that will mean periodic power outages, and I have been told "Just fix it". Im working to compel facilities to replace the generator, but I want to pursue a second solution as well.

 I'm starting to getting more into Networking and now have to present my first Topology to my boss to then execute it.
 Can someone give me some hints on where I can Improve ?
 ​
 Topology is as following:
 6 x Access Switches Aruba 1960 Instant ON 48G 2SFP+ 
 Attached on each:
 6x Aruba Instant On AP25
 All Switches will be connected Redundant to either (depending on deliverablitly) via 1Gig
 3x 6300F Aruba CX (due to need of SFP+ Interfaces)
 or
 2x 6300M with 24 SFP+ Interfaces (Then Link to Access will be 10Gig.)
 Aruba CX Stack will be VSX. 
 All VLAN's (About 6) will be trunked to a Sophos UTM which will be doing Inter VLAN Routing.
 ​
 Is there something I can / need to improve ?

 Not fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was informed that I could talk to the Cisco sales rep for quotes. I am planning to convert my current collapsed core into spine leaf architecture. My network is not that big. It is basically 1 production and the rest are tenant networks. The traffic is 95% east west and the remaining 5% is north south is when we are doing a test with other organization. We do a lot of BUM traffic and multicast. We have some instances that some tenants will run some test between them. We also do a lot of data transfer to our storage from 500GB to some TB. We have some compute nodes to process the data that got transferred.
 About a firewall, I am leaning towards Palo Alto. I have worked with PAN in the past and really liked it. 
 Anyways, I am thinking two the Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX for the spines and leaf switches. Is the 93180YC-FX good candidate for spine?
 I would like to use VRF-lite to each tenant/lab. We currently have 8 tenants and growing. At the moment, I am still wrapping my head around how I can get the two tenants to connect to each other via L3VNI. What is the typical way of doing this?
 About the firewall, I am still trying to figure out the best place to deploy it. Reading some Spine leaf docs, it seems the firewall is usually located at the border leaf. And the Upstream network is on a VRF-lite. Some says use the firewall to route between tenants. The global table seems to be just the fabric. Am I understanding this correctly?
 I would like to use my C9300 as an access switches and use VRRP between the local leaf switches. Is this even a valid design in the real world?
 Does the leaf need to be in vPC if I were to do VRRP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of a rant, but I'm just wondering: I work for a small company with 700 users and 15 offices. We have 65 VMs (VMware environment) spread across multiple locations, Cisco switches, Fortigate firewalls and APs, UPSs, EMC SANs, Dell servers, Veeam Backup, Wasabi, SharePoint, OneDrive, O365 Mail (hybrid), Power BI, and 100 iPads (with a subpar MDM). The list could go on and on, and my point here is that we have only one IT director, one system administrator/network administrator/security person (me), and three helpdesk folks. One of the helpdesk people is amazing, but the other two just float by.
 My question is this: I've been here for 8 years, and I've noticed that we get zero training, everything is a dumpster fire that needs to be put out, management doesn't listen to important security changes that need to be made, and there are no policies in place, such as an email policy, internet policy, BYOD policy, etc. (I have sent all of these to management and HR for approval, but they just don't write back.) The culture here, as in the people, is great; I've never worked with such an array of awesome people. However, they don't seem to care about any structure or advancement of learning of any kind. I just constantly feel behind the eight ball and can never get caught up to even have time for training. 
 Has anyone else's workplace been like this? If so, what did you do to change it?

 I need to decide to upgrade from older Cisco 2900 switches and ruckus wifi to new hardware. Its not much devices, 1 server rack with core switch and office floor switches + wlan APs. I mainly use switching and 802.1x in switches, no routing no complex functionality. Wireless setup is simple too + couple of RADIUS auths.
 I like cisco stability and ruckus wifi. I do not like cisco's lack of telemetry compared to what Arista seems to be able to offer (cloudvision)
 I do not have Arista or Extreme experience, but Arista seems to be highly praised in networking community.
 I am not sure about Arista wireless. Mojo/CUE?
 Also I am not sure Arista's lack of NAC or radius authentication of devices over wireless or LAN (correct if I am mistaken).
 I have some level of local IT partners demos done to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently getting ready for moving into a new building and I need a sanity check on my options. I'll preface this with I'm in the UK and getting stock of anything has been a nightmare since Brexit!
 New building is a training facility/office space with about ~300 data points across 2 floors. On average there's only about 70 users on site, but it peaks to ~350 with guests etc.
 I've been in talks with Aruba for a while, and they've finally given me their solution, which is 2x CX6300M and 6x CX6100 which is coming in at over £100K MSRP. Originally they spec'd CX6400 at almost £220K!
 Their issue is the lead time is 36 Weeks at best for the 6300, and 15 Weeks for the 6100.
 The second option is to go UniFi, I've already got an extensive UniFi wireless system already and we're sticking with Unifi for the wireless in the new building. I'll probably still stick with an Aruba 2930 at the core acting as the layer 3 router - I'm also looking at firewall options between Sonicwall and rolling my own PFSense on HPE server hardware for layer3 routing.
 The UniFi solution of 2x USW-Enterprise-48 and 6x USW-Pro-48-PoE is almost 1/5th the cost at less then £20K, obviously it lacks a lot of the features of the Aruba, and their Layer 3 stuff is laughably bad.But at 1/5th the cost, and being able to get it with only 1 weeks lead time, is this a good option or am I crazy?
 For the money I could by a cold spare of every Unifi switch and still be half the cost of the Aruba option.

 I already have ITIL V4. I'm looking to pursue Scrum Master and Prince2. 
 What would I pursue if I was a Manager over a help desk team of IT support people, or wanting to entrench myself deeper in a non-networking related way, networking as in N+? 
 Are there any other process/ framework oriented Certifications that aren't technical? 
 I want to get certed up as best as possible without delving into deeply technical stuff.
 I'd be so grateful for suggestions, thank you! ☺️

Since the upgrade, a fair amout of word documents in file servers, on prem SharePoint etc start opening word documents with "restricted editing". End users get confused and do not know what to do. It works perfectly to "release" the document (remote restrict editing). Tried to investigate when and how this reoccurs, but cannot seem to reproduce this in my lab.

 We are running Azure Virtual Desktop POC, and we do not have a static IP assigned to the hosts. We also use Cisco Umbrella as our proxy for users, and I would like to update the network address of the Virtual Desktops in Umbrella.
 Cisco suggest using either the Dynamic update tool, or an API.
 We can't log in to the OpenDNS dynamic update tool as we use SAML authentication, so Cisco support have suggested using the API. 
 Which is all good and well - but the API is a shell command - and I'm not sure how I can run this on a windows server as scheduled task, and ideally do not want to setup the Linux subsystem in windows on the Azure Virtual Desktops. 
 Details of the API commands are here - https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cloud-security/#!dynamic-network-update-getting-started/response-codes 
 The command they have suggested in Shell is 
 curl -i -X PUT 'https://updates.opendns.com/nic/update?hostname=<Umbrella network name>' \ -H 'Authorization: Basic %YourEncodedUsernamePassword%' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

 I am in a situation that I am not really sure how to face I've never got trough all the steps of a selection process for rejecting the offer but this time i think i must. They explained me the position twice and it sound for me like the position i'm in now as deployment of software technician, but didn't detailed the work schedule and the location of the position until the last interview. Then yesterday they confirmed me that they want me for the position. They offer 6.000€ more per year than my current wage working usually on remote but required to work occasionally to a warehouse that is an hour away in by train and another 15 min walking from the station, and doesn't seem to be a comfortable place to work in, besides they haven't confirmed if would be working on shifts and weekends which would be the worst. 
 I'm not sure how to explain that the position would mean a worse quality of life for me and reject it but without losing face with the corporation which i would like be to work with in the future, or just ghosting them and saving the effort. 
 Thank you for reading, and excuse me for any grammar mistakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am browsing this subreddit almost daily and I would like to suggest a new type of post. This will have engineers giving their opinions about a (fairly) new technology that they have actually implemented and their opinion.
 An example of a valid post will be:
 - We currently have Cisco DNA Center, and backing up this product is horrible (among everything else). You can select a backup destination, an NFS mount, but it does not have the option to "keep x amount of backups" or "keep the last X backups". Upon researching, I have found a bash script written by a Cisco engineer where you put it on the NFS server (its a bash script), deleting backups older than X amount of days. I realized that if backup was failing for a couple of weeks in a row and I was on holiday or forgot to check the backups on a daily basis, that script would delete all backups. It is such a bad design.
 ​
 Examples of bad posts are:
 - Vendor X has announced technology Y. This is a marketing/sales post where it was not a tested feature.
 - I have reused my old Cisco 2950s for OoB management. This is an old way of doing things with an even older technology.

 I literally only have these 9 tablets, and dont really want to pay for software just to do that
 Does anyone know of a free software, or a way to bypass it entirely?
 Specifically what i need, is for these tablets to only be able to access a specific browser url, and to default to that url after a specific time of inactivity. I also need to be able to have the screens on permanently.
 If anyone else has any other good ideas, im open to options.

 I'm looking for someone that has a bit of Fibre Channel/MDS experience to ask about some best practice stuff.
 I've been tasked with replacing our old Nexus FC switch(s). we have a pair of them with each server/storage with duel HBA's into each switch. I'll be using Cisco MDS 9148T's to replace the Nexus box's.
 The part that has thrown me, is although there is a port-channel trunk setup between the switches they have different vsans on each switch (trunk only allows their vlan so the neighbour switch will drop)... this would technically still work but i cant help but think it isnt best practice? 
 i would have thought you have both switches configured with the same vsan and a trunk between them? 
 If anyone has any examples of best practice for this senario it would be much appricated. 
 TL:DR - How should i configure 2 resilient FC switches with each server/storage having a connection to both switches.
 Thanks!

 I am using a Logi mouse and a Logi keyboard, both are bluetooth/wireless. I have a M1 MacBook Pro which can only connect to 1 external display. I am likely buying a new X1 Carbon which can connect to 2 external displays.
 Ideally I can have 4 screens on my desk: the 2 laptops and 2 external displays. This means one of the two external displays will be shared by both laptops. How can I switch it to read from one laptop and to the other laptop? This also means I will need a switch for the mouse and keyboard too. What is the best way to do this with the least amount of wires and least number of steps in daily operation?
 Additional information for use case: the M1 Macbook Pro will likely be used as a desktop while the X1 Carbon will often be unplugged and taken out as a laptop and plugged back in again when home.

All of our printers have been in place for almost 10 years, I am taking this opportunity to hopefully standardize and improve the naming convention. If I can get examples of current names and why they are named that way I would greatly appreciate it.
 Edit 1: to provide an example of what we are doing, the printer refresh walkthrough revealed 324 printers, we have managed to reduce that down to 300. There are departments that have a single location like one suite and is somewhat simple, there are others that have multiple locations throughout the city. We currently have the implementation of the Follow-me printer and have many staff that use it as was suggested in the comments. One example I can provide is the Police Department and the many building they occupy and the multiple units within their headquarters, for instance I’ll make a couple up just for example: PD-224MFP01 or FIN-MFP02, for the first example Police Department/building/Multi-Function Printer/1st out of 2 printers. The next is simply Finance/Multi-Function printer/2nd out of two.

 I've been in tech and working as a sysadmin/manager for the last ~15 years and a Microsoft teacher for the last 7 years. A year ago I started my own MSP and I seriously miss my teaching days and since there's not exactly alot of competition in my country I've been planning on starting my own school for the last couple of months. The following table is the curriculum I've been thinking of teaching (along with other qualified sysadmins). Any and all opinions greatly appreciated on this curriculum based on current market needs but keep in mind that I'm situated in EU, not the US if that makes any difference.
 At the end of each semester there's also an final exam that I make and have them complete. Books used…]]></summary>

 Anyway I'm not an infrastructure expert by any means and seek the help of the Sysadmin community before I go and spend some money.
 2 sites. Current infrastructure
 2 x hosts on primary site
  
Files server / DC / Print server (plan to split these)
 2nd DC
 SQL server
 ERP app server
 WMS app server
 Unifi controller for AP's
 Win10 vm
 Data for Sage 50 Accounts and Payroll
 Archive server for Solid Edge cad files.
  
1 x host on secondary site
  
DC / Print
 Unifi controller vm for AP's
  
Nothing drastic. All in hyper-v. Approx 100 endpoints.
 Dell or HPE?
 SSD MSA / SAN or SSD in host.
 VMWare or Hyper-V?
 MS Server licences - Datacentre licences for mobility over Standard
 Initial RFI and RFQ process is 3 x Dell servers, 1 x PowerVault ME5 , VMware , Veeam, MS DC licence for 68 cores. 5 year Pro Support 4hr mission crit, 3 year Prod support for VMware = £120,000 . Is that on the money?

 I started a small On prem exchange to O365 migration ( 20 users ) last Monday with the goal of a Friday cutover 
 We have been unable to get step one the destination verififcation to complete. Many support emails with repetitive circular responses. Support didnt read previous notes or look at screenshots proving impersonation was in place. Just kept sending the same 3 or 4 answers to various changing verification failures. 
 I begged for a phone call or to be escalated. Now that Ive missed 2 cutover appts and burned LOTS of time that I cant ( or wont ) bill the customer. I asked for a refund so I could try another tool.
 Now they offer to escalate and send this along 
 "This error comes up regardless of whether the tenant has a secret key or not. It's a new error that we have very limited information about. This has been escalated and our dev team is working on a permanent solution. Meanwhile, what we have so far is this - Most Common Errors Encountered in MigrationWiz while using Modern Authentication for EWS in Exchange Online."
 the link is the same link they have sent at least 3 times before, Ive replied with screenshots proving that Ive done those things. And worse, they admit its an issue they cant figure out, but are still willing to send that same link to further waste my time. 
 Oh and they ignore the refund request
 At this point I would pause using BitTitan for migrations with O365 as the end point...
 Not sure if my bank will let me reverse the CC charge ... 
 Rant off

 Those ISP Connections plug directly into the Core Cisco Switch. 
 On the Switch we have 2 specific VLAN's that utilize like 5 Ports a piece. 
 ISP 1 Equipment Plugs into Port 1 Which is VLAN 4... Ports 2, 3,4, 5 are also VLAN 4.
 So, Port 1 pulls ISP 1 Connection to it.. And then blankets ports 2, 3, 4, 5 with that ISP Connection.
 ISP 2 Equipment plugs int Port 6 Which is VLAN 9... Ports 7, 8, 9, 10 are also VLAN 9.
 So Port 6 pulls ISP 2 Connection to it.. And then blankets port 7, 8, 9, 10 with that ISP Connection.

 The other 12 VPC's are currently interconnected via VPC Peering. 
 This new VPC will be one which hosts instances that mange products in the other VPC's, so think development, dev OPs, etc. 
 Now, using a transit gateway in this new VPC would be easy to route traffic in and out of VPC. But my question now is with the other VPC's.
 I understand I'd have to connect VPC(13)'s transit gateway with a transit gateway populated in the other 12 VPCs, but would this transit gateway overwrite the prior legacy VPC Peerings? 
 TL'DR
 building new VPC that needs to connect to 12 other VPC's. 
 the 12 vpc's connect to each other via peering.
 want to leverage transit gateway on VPC 13.
 will doing transit gateway for VPC 13 to the other 12 VPC's break the original 12 VPCs' peering?
 Can i use transit gateway for VPC 13 to other 12, but keep peering within original 12?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am currently working on deploying a second core switch to be in sync with our current live core switch on the network. I am doing this so that our network can have redundancy and decided to go with Virtual Stackwise technology. I think I have configured the switches correctly but they are not synching. Right now due to physical limits between our locations, only one of the SVL can be connected. I was thinking that the DAD link and the second SVL interface can wait until we have more fiber panels put into our buildings (it will be soon). Will not having the DAD link connection up cause the two switches to not sync? Also, do you need to configure the second core switch to have configurations or just applying the stackwise configuration will have it pull configs from the original switch?
 ​
 These are the configs I implemented into the two switches. Currently, only interface 1/0/39 from each switch are physically connected to one another.
 Core Switch 1 Config:
 stackwise-virtual
 domain 101
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
 description Link_To_MIL-B80-CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/39
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/40
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW2
 ​
 Core Switch 2 Config
 stackwise-virtual
 domain 101
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
 description Link_To_MIL-B80-CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/39
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW1
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/40
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW1
 ​
 Edit: doing 'show switch' on CoreSW1 shows that it's the only device. On CoreSW2, it shows itself as switch 2 and it's active (I configured it to be switch 2) and Switch 1 is provisioning (on this switch there is no MAC address or any info.

 So as the title says, I have been at this job for one year and after six months of working here my manager quit, leaving me as the sole IT person for the company. I hit my one year mark and begged for a year review since I had been doing all the IT on my own for six months with it seeming like they were never going to replace him.
 They decided to promote me to IT Manager and gave me a 20% raise! 
 But now the imposter syndrome is setting in, with this newly appointed title I'm just not too sure where to start.
 For context, this is a small post house for a media entertainment company, we only have 10 full time employee's, but we do have a rotating staff of about 20 artists and producers.
 Can any IT management or people in similar positions give me some advice on steering this ship smoothly?
 I started IT in 2020 as helpdesk for about a year then moved to jr sysadmin, so I feel like I'm not qualified, however I'm very grateful and excited for this opportunity and want to do my best. 
 Luckily there is a decent amount of down time, so if anyone has any material I should read or watch, I'd love the recommendations.
 Thanks!
 Edit: this negativity is bussin bussin

 Any suggestions? Any websites or subreddits that I should look at in order to keep myself a bit more informed?

 My company manages some mid sized business network and we filled out the entire places with EnGenius APs. We got great coverage and all was decent, but throughout time I am noticing that they aren’t that great. They will randomly lock up (still can ping but gui not working nor can anyone connect) so we have to reboot. Lately it seems like they like to disconnect frequently, especially for iPads. It’s so frustrating. Does anyone have any suggestions for a different AP for a mid sized business? I believe we have 20 AP here. Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a Juniper EX9208 core switch and using OSPF.
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.4
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.5
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.16 passive
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.77 passive
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.18 passive
 set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface irb.19 passive
 unit 16 {
 family inet {
 address 10.10.10.1/24 {
 vrrp-group 50 {
 virtual-address 10.1.50.1;
 priority 150;
 preempt;
 accept-data;
 }
 }
 }
 }
 It is straightforward where I have two interfaces active and doing neighborship and the rest are passive interfaces to advertise their subnets.
 I received a request to block one of the passive-interface (irb.16 / 10.10.10.0/24 ) subnet from being advertised to the neighbor that is forming on (irb.5). I can not remove the passive command from interface irb.16 since it will stop being advertised to both neighbors and not our goal.
 What is the easiest way to block this subnet (10.10.10.0/24) where I can apply it to the neighbor on irb.5 only?

 Am I supposed to know fire stop code or the distance between my network cables and electrical cables. 
 At most the direction I can think of is a 48ru cabinet to support (size/depth of our switches) and space for the patch panels. 
 Our shop also requires a specific cable manufacturer for copper, so I include that and that the cables have to pass testing (poe, continuity and grounding), 
 cable trays to be installed hanging from the ceiling (but am I supposed to specify the size of a j hook or that it must be bolted and secure?)
 Bundles must be secured with velcro.
 Service loop for 1m at each end of termination.
 Cables shouldn't be more than 95m etc.
 I would love a suggestion into reading material or how I can keep up with the requirements for physical cabling. We have had many phases of construction and most of this was handled by consultants and I was never privy to the details, but now the PMs are asking me for this info and I'm a bit lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm working on a project where I need to connect a workstation in one town to a workstation in a different town. I am creating the project completely virtually (in Microsoft Hyper-V), with servers acting as routers.
 For each network, I've created a server, switch and client that can communicate with each other, but I can't seem to get them to communicate between networks. As far as I know, the only tools I can use in the scenario are Windows based, so I've been trying to use RRAS, but haven't had any luck. I don't need to worry about an internet connection at all, so I've just been attempting a static route between the servers/routers.
 I've created this diagram (https://imgur.com/a/6D4VvNZ - sorry for poor quality). I basically need a client (192.168.1.1) to talk to another client (192.168.2.1). They can both talk to their servers (192.168.1.254 / 192.168.2.254) but I can't get the servers to talk to eachother. I have two NICS on each server/router, one with the private IP address and one with the public IP address (173.15.15.x/30).
 Has anyone got any ideas where I might be doing wrong?
 Thanks in advance

 I've gotten about 10% increase over the last 3 years, but inflation has gone up 21%. So technically I have been losing value over time.
 Are you being compensated for inflation or is it being ignored?

 When Deploy-Application.exe is clicked, the UAC prompts immediately, but afterward there is roughly a 20 second delay before the Welcome message prompts wherein the user is directed to close applications and proceed. I thought perhaps the process was delayed due to copying the MSI's locally, so I removed all but two small ones and it's still the same.
 Has anyway else experienced this, and know of a workaround?
 Even if I can have a preceding "Please wait" message appear, that would work fine as well.

 In testing I could send an email containing only: https://ourdomain.com

 Then I'd send one with only: https://0urd0ma1n.com (or any other domain)
 and it would come right through.
 I have no idea why this is the case yet, it's a small typical website that hasn't been hacked in any way.

Am I correct in thinking this would be massive overkill as we only have about 30 FTEs which are all US based - and work remote. My plan was provisioning company issued laptops loaded with an MDM and VPN to our FTEs, and VDIs for our contractors. 
 My question is in terms of headaches and pricing, wouldn't it be overkill to setup VDIs for everyone including FTE? Let me know as I do not have the most experience with VDIs company wide. As my last companies stuck to VDIs for contractors and company issued laptops for FTEs.

 I have an application that is made of up of several servers. 2 of the servers are just typical physical servers which are dual-nic'd and plugged into a pair of Nexus 9k switches. The rest of the environment is made up of virtual machines (ESXi 7.0.3 EPP w/ vCenter). The application calls for creating a SPAN port which will monitor traffic on the 2 physical servers and then to monitor that traffic on 2 virtual machines. I am not sure how to set this up? I am good in VMware, but more of a novice when it comes to Cisco networking (or really networking in general.) Is this possible and if so, how would I go about configuring this?

Last year I took a great paying job with a soul-less corporate machine and last week it came back to bite me as I was laid off at a fairly bad time to be laid off in this industry. Several other corporations in my area also laid off IT workers saturating the market. Now with the "recession" very few are hiring. I have applied to over 130 positions in LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, etc... in the past week but all I have heard back were head hunters and rejection letters. 
 I understand this is all part of the process and with my skillset I will find somewhere to land eventually, but its hard to keep my thoughts positive when the livelihood of my family are on the line. I am 4 years from paying off my house so I really do not want to move as my mortgage is 1/3 that of renting a 3 bedroom house just about anywhere in the country right now. This has lead me down the road of looking for Full Remote jobs, and let me tell you, they are crazy... 
 Advertised as Remote Work - (But you must live 30 minutes from our office, and come into the office 3 days a week), or you must live in the same state or you are immediately rejected. The rejection letters are nice to have, but each one is like adding another brick into the pile I am carrying into depression. 
 Then there are the fake jobs, the MSPs posing as real jobs, the scams, the head hunters that want you to scan your Drivers license and Social Security card to them... Yah right buddy. 
 ​
 I just want to work on someone's network making it better for a decent wage.

 Just taking a chance here in case anyone else has Sharp-printers and have a nicer way of deploying them either via GPO or Intune?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm struggling to understand a concept our MSP has described as the reason staff using MRP and lightweight CAD programs are getting slow speed
 ​
 We have 1gb leased line symmetrical and an Sophos XG firewall running SSL VPN via the Sophos connect app. Before this, we had 300/100mb running off on old Draytek running L2TP. I can't say if MRP speeds are faster as we have only had the MRP system recently so it was just being implemented when the lines switched, , but the CAD stuff would work almost as quickly as if onsite
 ​
 Now, what takes milliseconds onsite is taking 20 or so seconds (this is just opening windows, no manipulation of the MRP/CAD files). Speaking to our MSP, they have said that it's due to the XG overhead on processing and routing the data. But I genuinely struggle to see it slowing speed down so much. Especially as the CAD stuff worked file over L2TP 
 If correctly configured, should we be seeing such delays over VPN? Onsite, everything is fine. The MRP and CAD software are hosted on SQL instances inside the network. I assumed there was traffic shaping of packet inspection turned on, but they say no
 ​
 Am I going mad??!?!

 My first guess was to make the announcement of the account migration, tell them the new format to figure out the username themselves (it's just firstname.lastname@domain) and send each an email with just the password without further context, so the information from one email is not enough. If I could encrypt the emails, it would be perfect, but I don't have the users public keys, as they are external. Though I have limited knowledge about email security, so please educate me. 
 Is there another way to get the passwords to the users securely or is it "good enough" to just send them separately? (Passwords need to be changed upon first login.)
 Thank you! 
 Disclaimer: I'm not the one responsible for the user migration, I just administrate the first service that wants to use the new AD.

 Basically I've been tasked with building a standalone media console, and I've been given some creative license to see exactly how much I can do with it. So far I've managed most of what I need to do without much issue, but I'm running into some confusion when it comes to the Custom Logon and embedded boot features on enterprise. To a degree this is a (multi-app) kiosk deployment, we don't want it especially obvious that it's running windows, so we want to suppress all the boot UI and windows logon UI with autologin to a locked down account, we have an application we want to use for the shell in place of explorer and lock down any breakout keys.
 I've made a few custom images and managed to sort out all the users and automated oobe features I need, now I'm moving onto the lockdown/embedded features portion. Pouring through the documentation on all the customlogon and embedded features from Microsoft, I'm not getting much of a direct answer as to when and how to deploy them, has anyone here worked with them before?
 Will these deploy properly if they're apart of an answer.xml configured in WSIM and installed from a custom image? Do they need to be configured in WinPE and built into the image from there? Can they be implemented to the OS from a provisioning package after initial deployment?
 Any help is greatly appreciated

 I'm having a big headache trying to work out how Microsoft licensing works for our Hyper-V implementation, especially with regard to SQL server.
 We have two independent Hyper-V clusters, each consisting of 3x 32-core single CPU hypervisors. Under normal operation our VMs are distributed between the two clusters. In a disaster scenario, we can manually bring up the VMs from one cluster onto the other.
 What I want to find out is:
  
Do I need Windows Server licenses for each guest VM, or just for the physical hypervisors?
 If I want to run a 4-vcpu SQL server VM on one cluster, what SQL license do I need to buy?
  
I asked the person inside our org who I consider to be the most Hyper-V expert and they said that they run physical SQL servers to avoid having to think about this...
 If anyone can help me figure it out I'd be most thankful. We already have enough server datacenter licenses with SA to cover our current VM load if it is one license per VM, but I'd like to know this for sure...
 Thanks!

 Our corporate network is configured to use Radius to authenticate devices connecting to the meraki network.
 We have a security group that all machines are a part of that allow authentication to the radius server.
 I have placed the macbook in this group and it is still unable to connect, it gets prompted for a username and password which it shouldn't do, it should automatically connect.
 I am new to networking macbooks in corporate environments, does anyone have any experience with this? Much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys. I'm trying to figure out how routers encapsulate smaller packets to transfer it over larger mtu interface ? Like after pmtu did the trick and the whole transfer is happening with pmtu 1500, how does such packets transfer over like jumbo frame network with 9000 mtu. Do router merge 6 1500 bytes packets into one 9000 packet or transfer them as 1500 bytes without any change ?
 Example network:
 Host 1 (1500 mtu) ------> eth0(1500mtu)---router---eth1(9000mtu) ----------- eth1(9000mtu)--router--(eth0 1500mtu) --------> host 2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning! I know i should be complaining about users or the stress of my job, but i'd like to interrupt with a question about infrastructure. I've got a use case where its a small operation (<50 users) with a full 365 system running business standard licenses for all users. 
 A few years ago I migrated our physical PBX system into the cloud, and it works just fine, but as the integration into the microsoft environment has gotten smoother, i'm investigating the option of moving from a third-party VOIP to skype for business. 
 I know microsoft has mostly good documentation, but i'm more interested if anyone here uses skype in a similar environment and what your feedback/experience has been. I'm asking here because I'm not interested in a sales pitch, i want to know what it's like from people who manage it or at the very least built/configured it into your organization.
 Thanks!

 We are planning a migration from Azure AD to Azure AD.
 In the source tenant the devices are Intune enrolled.
 In the lab, they were able to test the migration from tenant A to tenant B and that went well, including profiles.
 Intune is causing us problems. In the new tenant, the device is not rolled out in Intune (automatic enrollment activated). 
 Somehow we can't get the device out of Tenant A's Intune.
 Does anyone have experience with this and can give me tips?

 This worked as intended on a previous laptop, but it always seems to jump to 'ItIsntHere' when ran at login on this laptop. If I run the batch file manually it's working as intended, it just isn't working properly at login. I've tried added delays and that hasn't made a difference.
 I think the next step would be instead of checking for the NAS, checking if an ethernet connection is present or not - how would I set up a check for this?

replacing some older nodes
 Upgrading them all from 2012r2 to 2016 
  
The SAN disks are mounted on those nodes under 
  
C:\some_random_example_folder\
  
In the past (Win2012 days) we enabled bitlocker for the C: drives of all HyperV nodes - which never affected the mounted disc from the SAN.
 Now after switching from 2012 to 2016 and adding some new nodes - i am wondering: is that still the same with 2016? 
 Can i easily enable Bitlocker on those new nodes for C:\ without affecting the C:\some_random_example_folder\ mounted SAN disks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I´ve had some issues surrounding blocking the access to the admin console to the Dream Machine for a "Guest" VLAN.
 Following many guides and some common sense I have already blocked all access to other VLANs and to the IPs of the Gateway (Dream Machine). Additionally I have blocked all Port 22, 80 and 443 Connections to those IPs, but I can still access every single IP of the Dream Machine.
 ​
 Let´s say I have the
 - IoT VLAN 172.27.0.0/16
 - Default VLAN 172.16.0.0/16 
 Gateways are .1
 ​
 - Blocked access for clients in IoT to both Gateway IPs (for testing, since it does not work)
 - Blocked access for clients in IoT to ports 22, 80, 443 on both Gateway IPs
 ​
 I still get through to the admin console on the Dream Machine via every IP (172.27.0.1 & 172.16.0.1) whenever I try it from the IoT VLAN :(
 ​
 I would appreciate some help from anybody with some more experience :)

 Weird thing is, in outlook web and on mobile this works fine and we get all emails, even the ones that were sent before we changed address.
 I have tried to create a new outlook profile and rebuild the search index, but i get the same result. Cant find anyone with a similar issue.

Thinking there was another member, it would be a hand in hand working environment, turns out i will be the sole sysadmin, no one to guide me around their system that im expected to know. My problem comes in when they said they'll be outsourcing their work from other countries by offering their pc as a service to them. They want to restrict them from copying data / files from their pc and would only allow them to use the graphic design software. I'm overwhelmed and i am not sure where to start. Any advise and tips would be greatly appreciated. 
 Also going to setup a home lab, so if you could advise with what softwares to use as well I'd be more than grateful!

 A user of mine suddenly gets the following error when trying to sign in to his domain account.
 the security database on the server does not have account for this workstation trust relationship
 The computer is domain joined but it does not exist anywhere in Active Directory on premises. In endpoint manager, on the other hand, I can find it just fine.
 What would you recommend as a good course of action? Should I remove the computer from the domain, for example, and add it again with the same computer name? If I do that will the user lose access to his domain profile? 
 Any kind of advice is greatly appreciated. Currently there's no senior in the company so I'm afraid to make a wrong move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 we've run into some strange behaviour at a client's DC. They recently moved to another office and finally made the choice to put some money into new server hardware, so we migrated their Srv2016 DC from an old ESXi to a new one. We didn't do a V2V (for various reasons) but chose to simply make a final Veeam backup and restored it as a new VM on the new host.
 At first boot the machine went into safemode (with AD repair) as we've expected. So we logged on, changed boot behaviour back to normal and rebooted several times to check if it's running correctly.
 Now, ~2 weeks later, users complained they didn't have access to a share anymore.
 So we've tried to login on the DC using our Domain Admin user and realised it isn't working. Screen says "user can't login due to account restrictions or maybe wrong characters in password - as a blank". That's nonsense. So we tried to login using the local admin account and there it says the account would have been deactivated (which isn't true either).
 Now we're stuck except for having remote powershell access (as system user) with our RMM software.
 I already used it for checking if some safemode has been activated (bcdedit) - which isn't the case.
 We also restarted the machine twice yesterday evening. Startup takes ages, but eventually it comes up to the same state.
 Anyone any idea?
 Cheers
 Jay

 Background: I have 2012R2 domain controllers (I know I need to update) with a Windows CA server that is issuing computer certs to client devices. Windows NPS runs 802.1x authentication using the computer certs for auth. None of the aforementioned services share an operating system; each service has their own VM(s).
 So, in the late 2010s when disabling SMBv1 was a priority because of then-recent vulnerabilities, I disabled SMBv1 on all my clients and servers, but apparently not my domain controllers. If I remember correctly, I tried disabling it on the DCs too, but that broke GPO, so I reverted. Back then, I wasn't running 802.1x, but the CA server was t…]]></summary>

 We are a smallish org (45 staff) and I'm preparing to move us to Windows 11 at some point next year, once one of our in house apps is updated from VB4 to .Net and will actually work. We use MDT for reimaging and deployment which happens a handful of times a year. No InTune, we don't do cloud.
 My question is... is there a fix that actually works either via Group Policy or preferable PowerShell as part of the task sequence to remove those damn shortcuts? I'm talking the consumer apps such as TikTok and Spotify.
 FWIW my test rig is on 11 Pro 22H2.
 Also big F**K YOU to Microsoft for including this consumer shit in 11 Pro in the first place!!

 We're on Google Workspace and we've looked into using Google Voice but while it allows for international outbound calling, it can only assign US and Canada based Google Voice numbers to our agents (ideally, each agent would have a local VoIP-assigned number for each their respective regions--US, Europe, India--that our internal users can call for IT help without having to make international calls.) We also looked in Zoom's 'Zoom Phone' and while it was better, they don't currently support India numbers.
 At this point, we've resigned to the fact there likely won't be one VoIP product to cover ever country we're looking for but we're now thinking maybe a global redirect service might be the way to go--one master toll-free number that will redirect to whoever is on-call.
 Anyone have any suggestions or products to avoid?

 So I think I've got the backend concept of VXLAN down now at about 95% understanding.
 The Overlay I see as the easier part, VTEP sends a BUM or unicast packet to the other VTEP with the right VNI in, from there, the VTEP that recieves it will look in its database for that VRF/VNI depending on if its a L2 or L3 VNI and then forward onto the correct VRF and end device
 The main confusion left is how different underlay routing combinations work and interact with eachother.
 So far, this is how I see it. And please either feel free to totally correct me or can you please verify if I'm right as well.
 For data plane flood and learn, it's multicast on the underlay, using a combination of OSPF (an IGP) to distribute the RP addresses everywhere, and multicast to send out the packets to the R…]]></summary>

When I say relatively simple, I mean, VMware server connected to core switch, connected to firewall, out to internet, nothing like VRRP or other tech.
 Windows Server IP: 172.16.1.10
 Server default route: 172.16.1.2
 Its Default Gateway: 172.16.1.2 (Core switch)
 Firewall: 172.16.1.1
  
Traceroute to 8.8.8.8
 1 172.16.1.2 (core switch)
 2 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 3 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to 9.9.9.9
 1 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 2 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to mail.google.com
 1 172.16.1.2 (core switch)
 2 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 3 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to 8.8.8.8 
 1 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 2 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Why would some trace's hit the core switch (default gateway), and some hit the firewall directly first? Again no other tech is in place... No VRRP, no routing protocol (OSPF, etc), Other than the physical server is connected to the core switch with LACP. 
 The core switch (router) only has one route, and that is its default route of throwing everything at the firewall

 I am facing an unusual issue. We recently acquired a new customer, and unfortunately, their IT personnel have left the company, leaving us with the responsibility of managing their IT infrastructure. Previously, the IT personnel was the main point of contact for everything related to their IT infrastructure.
 Currently, we are facing an issue where the owner of the company has access to only one of the domains' admin credentials, which he can use to manage the account or manage some of the systems. However, there are two different domains, and we cannot access the second domain controller. Additionally, the infrastructure includes a mixture of Linux and Windows machines with various operating systems, but we only have access to about 10% of that infrastructure due to a lack of credentials.
 For Linux machines, I am planning on resetting the root credentials individually.
 Is there any way for us to gain access to the second domain controller? We have access to their VM host, but we are unable to log in to that particular OS. 
 Thank you in advance for your help.

 Other than my first 2 years of HelpDesk at my University, and a horrid 6 months at Best Buy/Geek Squad to make ends meet, I've spent the last 17 years at my current job. We are a bioscience research nonprofit that competes with the big boys for government grants and contracts. Times have gotten much leaner over the years, as far as bigger grants going out, so when I started, there were about 550 end users, supported by…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our current RDP deployment is using a Server 2016 host as the RD connection Broker, RD Gateway, RD web and RD licensing server. The RD session host role is installed on a different server 2019 host. 
 We have run up a new server 2019 host and are looking to transfer the RD connection Broker, RD Gateway, RD web and RD licensing server roles from the current server 2016 host. After doing some reading, we have found that transferring the RD connection broker role is usually accomplished by configuring a HA cluster, adding the new server to the cluster and then removing the old server. This requires a SQL database and seems like a bit of work. 
 We were wondering if it is possible to install the RD connection broker service on the new server 2019 host, create a new RDP deployment, and then add the existing session host into the new deployment? Would this cause a problem being that the session host is already a part of the old RD collection?
 I have done some reading online and can’t find a straight answer as to whether servers can be a part of multiple RDP collections at the same time or whether they need to be removed from the current collection before being added to the new one. 
 Any help would be appreciated.
