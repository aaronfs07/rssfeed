The page usually says something like "make sure this is your security image!"
 I can't imagine this is supposed to sway those with criminal intent, is it supposed to prevent users from logging in to other accounts?

I would like to separate some network from the global table using vrf lite. I want to start with the oob ports. I checked the Cisco docs but didn't find how can leak routes between the global and vrf lite within the same collapsed core switch without sending the traffic to the next hop (provider). It is more like a inter-vlan but one of the SVIs is in global and the other is in vrf lite.
 Is there an easy and proper way of accomplishing what am trying to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 i wrote a thread some weeks ago about performance issues on our RDS farm. I did some more monitoring and saw that the cpu queue is sometimes a bit to high (about 5 - 10 for a 16 core VM).
 So i like to spread the user over more servers and read about the sizing guide from microsoft. Our users working with the office programs, ERP System and doing normal surfing and research via MS Edge and Google Chrome. Due to this workload i would say that its categorized in the heavy work load / power users.
 For that Microsoft says i should use 4 vCPU and about 8 GB RAM per User. Thats beeing said for our about 140 User, i shoud have about 144 vCPUs and 1 TB RAM. Thats seems quite high for me. Usally i dont provision 1:1 CPU ratio. 
 Microsoft also say, i should not provision more then 2 users per vCPU. Thats still 72 vCPUs for all. Due to the workload i dont get a good ratio about real threats and vCPU (on Hyper-V). 
 I'm quite curios about other RDS farms with about the same workload. I read some threats on the internet where 20 Users are on a quad core system with 16 GB RAM. Other wrote that they have 8 Core, 32 GB RAM but just provision it to 4 users. Its quite hard to see the real workload on other infrastructures. 
 So, could some people tell about their sizing in situation there the users doing a simiar workload?
 Thanks

 Let's say an IT administrator accidentally back-ups a 5 TB VM with Data Lock enabled. (which should not be backed-up at all) We would than have to pay for the storage consumption for this VM the entire year? There is no work-around to overcome this? 
 I know this is the purpose of immutable back-ups, but cost is also a big factor when using cloud back-up solutions like Druva.

 We have a client coming on board for support and would like a VPN. Normally we'd configure an SSTP VPN but in this case port 443 is already being routed to their webserver from the internet.
 If I forward another public port (say 414 as an example) to 443 private and point to the VPN server, would this work?
 I'd wager the connection address on SSTP client on other connecting windows endpoints would be vpn.CERTNAMEHERE.co.uk:414?
 Can you poke holes in that theory or point me towards a better solution?
 Besides another static IP that is referenced on the DNS entry to get to the WAN IP I'm struggling to come up with ideas.
 TIA!

 I am new in a company and have noticed that the Windows firewall is deactivated on almost 3000 servers. The reason: The effort to configure the firewall is too great or the Windows firewall would be pointless anyway. I would now like to change this situation and gradually activate the firewall on all servers. The problem is also that the necessary IPs and ports are hardly or not at all documented.
 ​
 Now my question: How would you proceed to achieve this goal? Simply switching on the firewall would instantaneously paralyse most servers. Firewall
 My idea would be: First document the active connections with netstat and write corresponding rules, then activate the firewall with Allow-Any for a certain time and then study the log to find more IPs and ports.
 ​
 I am curious about your suggestions and thank you in advance for your ideas.

 I`m posting this for a colleague that has a problem on an VM running Windows Server 2019 about Task Manager.
 After you open task manager and on the tab Processes only Status, CPU, Memory are displayed and disk is missing. when he tries to enable the option its not available, its greyed out.
 The account used is domain administrator but this happens with a local admin account as well.
 Did someone stumbled upon this or could you help us with the direction to check with might cause this, maybe some settings in the registry.
 Thank you,

 I am having an issue in our enviroment which i can't crack yet. 
 We migrated to M365, and let people work on their workstation. We offer some apps (including M365) as remote apps through RDS. We use Windows Server 2012 R2 (yea yea i know, we are upgrading asap)
 For the people saying, why don't use the local M365 apps. Our back-office system only works good on TS-systems and needs Outlook and word for some functionality. 
 The issue is, when people open attachement in this outlook app or from our back-office system. The outlook 'home' page (The page with inbox and all your e-mail) stays as the focused the screen. The openend attachement or e-mail from our back-office system stays behind that outlook screen until you open it from the taskbar. 
 I am getting the feeling it is an Server 2012 R2 issue or a remote app issue. When we used RDS with desktop for our users, they didn't have this issue but we used Office 2010 then and Exchange 2013.
 Thanks in advance,
 Kind regards,
 Roy de Jonge
 p.s. English is not my primary language, i am sorry for any mistakes in spelling or grammar.

 My example is:
 I have a group policy object assigned to an OU named Site1.
 With 2 GPO's applied, which apply the same setting, on one the setting is Enabled, the other the setting is Disabled. One GPO is named PolicyObject1 and the other is PolicyObject2.
 PolicyObject1 has a link order of 1, PolicyObject2has a link order of 2.
 PolicyObject1 will be applied first, then PolicyObject2 will be applied, overwriting PolicyObject1.
 Am I correct, and if so, please can you provide some Microsoft Documentation regarding this? I'm fairly sure this is right, but I need the documentation to prove it. Thanks :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was tough to come up with a title to sum up what I'm talking about but here are the details:
 We've got half a dozen offices and we are in the process of changing the WAN vlan at each one. Here's a very simplified diagram of one site with a made up subnet:
 https://i.imgur.com/lIDZX3R.png
 Like I said, this is a very simplified diagram but the part in question is accurate. I used the green arrows to show how traffic is flowing from outside to the local LAN. During this change I've got a constant ping going to a host inside the local network from another location across the MPLS.
 The process is:
  
I ssh into the WAN switch from outside (MPLS)
 Select all 4 interfaces at once
 issue the access vlan command
  
At this point I lose anywhere between 5 and 10 pings and then the connection comes back up. Now, I'm reasonably certain that the lost pings are caused by something to do with the MAC address table on the switch but I'm not 100% and I'd really like to understand specifically what causes the brief disconnect. I started labbing this up in GNS3 but I quickly realized that the switch emulation isn't good enough to accurately simulate this scenario.
 If this isn't enough detail I'm happy to provide more in order to help identify what's happening.

I found a way to force a setting change for members, whether they are subscribers or not, but nothing is stopping them from manually changing this setting gain the future.

 I've been fighting the classic "no internet" globe at our primary location for 2 years. It seems to rear it's ugly head every 6-10 months and of course this Monday was a classic explosion of multiple computers not allowing Outlook to function even though the internet was connected. I've spent hours...nay days on this. 
 Our standard fix has been:
  
`sfc /scannow` `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth` [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet] EnableActiveProbing set to 1 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] NoActiveProbe set to 0 `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] DisablePassivePolling set to 1 restart computer 
  
I finally realized that an nslookup with "server 131.107.255.255" to any request fails...pcap shows no response from the server what-so-ever. Confirmed the traffic is being passed by the firewall and no clear blocks from anti-virus. 
 I can do a DNS request all day from other networks and IPs. I have access to a number of sites and all of them respond instantly to a dns query to the classic nds.msftncsi.com IP. Any recommendations on how to find out if MS is blacklisting my primary site IP? Who/how do I contact Microsoft regarding this?
 The above fixes have worked previously but of course today, something has changed and 3 computers continue to not function even after the fixes. I do not have IPv6 running on this network. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks for any rabbit holes I may not have run down. This has me frustrated and stumped. I think the fact that DNS isn't responding is my smoking gun but I don't know how to take it to the next level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was explaining to someone today about why we haven't adopted the LB sandwich for our NVAs in azure, the reason being that we use a lot of active directory and kerberos and neither of those should be natted. And they asked a good question...
 If the LB sandwich is so popular how are all the people using it out there handling their AD and kerberos? I don't actually know.
 Can you all enlighten me to your general setups when it comes to NVAs and authentication? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My fellow Redditors,
 I am redistributing BGP from my router into an OSPF process located in a VRF (Area 1). My router is connected to the Neighbor Router via Area 1. Area 1 is configured as a stub area. 
 My understanding of a stub area is that it blocks Type 5 LSAs. I am redistributing into the OSPF process that includes the stub area. Since my path would be BGP -> OSPF (Backbone Area 0) -> OSPF Area 1 (VRF) -> Neighbor Router (Area 1), does the Stub router located in OSPF Area 1 deny the Type 5 LSA coming via the Backbone area? 
 My understanding is that a Stub Area does not allow an ASBR to exist within it. My router that is redistributing BGP -> OSPF would be considered an ASBR. However, since I'm going from OSPF Area 0 to OSPF Area 1 in a VRF, does the VRF act as an ABR (and not an ASBR) thereby allowing the Stub area to receive the type 5 LSA?
 I understand the simple solution is to configure the Neighbor Router as a NSSA. However, this may not be a possibility. 
 Am I overthinking this? It is as simple as I am coming from BGP -> OSPF and the Stub Area prevents that type 5 LSA from entering it (VRF or not)?

Today I needed a USB to serial cable for a switch's console. That switch is on the other side of a huge building, so I wanted to test it before making the trek. I had found an old radioshack usb-serial adapter and plugged it into an inventory laptop, installed putty and went to the rack to look for a serial port to test it on. Ah ha!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spearphish attempt came as a fake reply to real e-mail that was several years old, from a vendor that had an email compromise.
 The attachment is a password protected zip with the password in message body and something about being unable to send the attachment otherwise (very true in this case).
 Extracted first payload contains large .htm which uses HTML smuggling to drop a second zip file with same password while putting up fake Office 365 page telling you how to open it.
 Second payload contains an .img file which mounts a filesystem and includes a .lnk shortcut to unleash the nastiness.
 From here everything is deeply obfuscated and resistant to being run in a sandbox. Proceeding any farther would require downloading payload files from the Internet and alerting the sender so this is where I stop for now. Even posting the filenames they use could leak information. I will say that the payload files all date from June to November 2021.
 The whole thing closely matches the technique described here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/
 So that's fun.

        <updated>2023-02-27T20:09:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been working on a project that involves taking the existing network of 192.168.1.0, splitting it up into VLANs and creating additional VLANs to allow for a Data Network and Voice Network. I have a Layer 3 core switch which is connected to an ASA and all of the VLANs are configured on the core switch. I implemented the design this weekend and am having trouble with the connections from the new VLANs to the pre-existing network.
 My configuration is as follows:
 ASA
 int g1/1 - Outside
 int g1/2 - Inside - 192.168.1.1 (Connected to Core Switch)
 route inside 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route inside 192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.2 is directly connected via g1/2 
 Core Switch
 vtp mode server
 int g1/0/1 (Connected to ASA)
 switchport access to vlan 10
 int vlan 10
 ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 80
 ip add 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 90
 ip add 192.168.102.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 
 ip routing is enabled 
 So here's what I've found so far:
 I can ping from 192.168.1.x to any other VLAN
 I can't ping the other way around
 DHCP is working. I'm able to receive all DHCP information and can reach the internet.
 I can ping all SVIs and ASA from 192.168.101.x
 I can't ping between 192.168.101.x and 192.168.102.x networks 
 There are ACLs applied to the inside interface on the ASA, but they appear to permit all icmp traffic and all ip traffic.
 I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this exact issue as searching on Google has been no help. I mostly get results with configurations that involve using the ASA for Inter-VLAN networking, using sub-interfaces and whatnot. I am strictly trying to setup Inter-VLAN networking on the L3 switch. Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have this guy that works... "works"... with us and we've noticed an increase in the frequency that we see Netflix up on his computer, through his browser. Now, we don't have a problem with someone pulling up Netflix while they work for background noise, if it helps them get the work done more efficiently, I myself have YouTube videos up while I'm working, it helps me concentrate and get my work done, and my boss doesn't have a problem with it. The major issue is that this guy doesn't really do anything, just sits on Yahoo! all day and watches Netflix. So we were thinking, we should block Netflix on his computer. The only problem is, Netflix has thousands of IP addresses, and trying to block, or redirect, based on IP would take a long time, time that we don't really have.
 So my question is this... does anyone know of an effective way to block Netflix on a domain computer, and only that domain computer? Blocking the site on the network completely is not an option, based on the nature of our work environment, so we need it to be just for one computer. We also do not want him to know that we actively blocked it, he has a bad temper and flies off the handle when things like this are brought up, and retaliation is a real fear, so a redirect to localhost is preferred. If it's not possible, I get it, but we need him to not be on Netflix all day.
 NOTE: 1.) My boss can't fire him, he's been trying. 2.) He's tried talking to him about things like this before, it doesn't work. 3.) HR has been ineffective at helping the situation, their advice as "All you can do is talk to him."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up a complex system using a cisco nexus with full routing enabled. I need to have two VRFs set up for regulations requirements. I need to get 4 networks on the switch run through 2 vrfs out two physical interfaces up to the firewall where Policy can handle it and let things go out to the internet. I am having trouble actually configuring it.
 The basic set up is kind of like this: 
 VR-Office
 vlan 12
 10.10.12.0/22
 10.10.12.1 gateway 
 vlan 16
 10.10.16.0/24
 10.10.16.1 gateway
 int eth1/1 ip add 172.16.16.129 #the far end will have an add of 16.130 
 VR-Accounting
 vlan 112
 10.20.12.0/22
 10.20.12.1 gateway 
 vlan116
 10.20.16.0/24
 10.20.16.1 gateway
 int eth1/2 ip add 172.16.16.133 #other side will have address 16.134 
 I need the two vlans to have an svi per vlan that I can add to the associated VRFs. Then I need to route to physical interfaces associated to the vrfs.
 The way I logically manage it in my head I imagine that the office vrf has two SVIs, one per vlan, with each having the IP address of the vlans gateway. Then the office vrf also has the physical interface. 
 I want to make sure that the vlans 12 and 16 are only routing on vrf vr-office and can be routed our eth1/1 to get out. 
 Am I misunderstanding anything? Would anyone be willing to explain how this might look in a L2/L3 router's config? I feel like I am missing something simple.

TLS certificates require domain names to work so DNS over TLS only works if you provide a hostname instead of an IP address, but if the device is connecting to a network for the first time and the DHCP server only provides the hostnames for the DNS servers then how is the device going to resolve the hostname to connect to the DNS server in the first place? Also, what if I'm connected to a single DNS server that supports DoT and the cached IP address disappears or something? How are these situations handled? And if you just cannot resolve any query then are you supposed to provide the IP address of the server as a fallback option? What is the best way to proceed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as the title says I believe that the company has lost all their data. There was a storm overnight that turned the power off for a while and when everyone came in this morning computers turned on like normal except the "server" (Win10 machine with all shared files on it). Basically the machine would not boot windows. Plugged the SSD into another computer and saw the data was RAW instead of NTFS. I have to format the drive in order to use the SSD again. They had 2 external drives plugged into the computer for backing up but apparently the last time anything was done on the drives was back in 2020 and there weren't even any backups. Is there anyway to recover the SSD without formatting or is it a total loss? The company does not have IT, they call us whenever there's an issue and we offered to do cloud backups a while back but they're cheap and refused saying they'd do it on their own.
 Update: the computer was windows 10 but they were running server 2019 on Hyper V. SSD has Been sent to data recovery center

The issue is that the main switch (Ubiquity) only allows mirroring of one port. This would be fine, except that I have redundant firewalls, with automatic fail over. The second FW is connected to another port on the switch.
 My thought was to put a HUB between the firewalls and the main switch, then plug the monitor into that.

Engenius's marketing materials indicate that they can be operated in a 'standalone' mode without a controller, but it's not clear to me if the standalone mode is basically the same UX and per-AP features that you'd get with the managed options, or if the standalone mode is basically the same as the older EnSky user interface.

 set interfaces ae8 native-vlan-id 1 set interfaces ae6 unit 0 family ethernet-switching native-vlan-id default 
 After doing some reading, I think it's just the difference in setting that actual ae8 interface to native vlan 1, whereas the second command is setting the logical ae6.0 interface to native vlan default which on this switch is also vlan ID 1. So vlan default = vlan 1. Wouldn't each interface act the same with anything on vlan 1?
 The change I am making is swapping po1 and 2 vlans. So I don't know why when I move po1 (which owns the default, or vlan1 traffic) to po2, traffic stops flowing. I feel it has something to do with the above commands.

 ​
 we have been running our GGC for some years now, and it gives a pretty constant 1:3 bandwidth saving. We just got our Akamai appliances and I'm curious how much that will be, probably higher peaks but less consistency. As we don't have private customers directly Netflix has not been interesting for now, but I could see huge savings on networks with many private customers.
 ​
 Which appliances are you running and how much Bandwidth do they save for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I am about to buy a new laptop, for my job. My job consists of a basic office work, excel, word, outlook and little bit of graphic design, photoshop. In my free time, I like to play games, mostly Dota 2, warzone.
 So I started to look for a laptop, for office work. I found out that if I dont want the lowest tier office laptop, I am gonna pay around 700-800 € (which is my budget). For this price, I can find some lower tier gaming laptops (10- 11th gen intel, rtx 3050, 144 Hz displays which I find very comfortable to work with). 
 Thats where my dilemma starts, would you rather buy a mid tier office laptop, but not have the ability to use it for entertainment, or aim for lower tier gaming laptop which may have some disadvatages ( overheating, weight, noise)? 
 My best options I found on the web so far:
 Office laptops: DELL Latitude 15-3520, ASUS Vivobook 15X OLED X1503ZA-MA437W,
 Gaming laptops: MSI GF63 Thin 11SC, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IHU6 Shadow Black 
 All of these are approximately 800€ (you can suggest different). Besides that, I am have a desktop PC at home, mid tier gaming machine, but sometimes I work from outside my home. I dont have any laptop right now.
 Thank you your replies, I appreciate all of the advices and shared experiences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a major power event at our main data center yesterday. Maintenance was being performed on our UPS, something went wrong and we lost all power to all of the racks including our production Nutanix cluster (5 hosts, ~120 running VMs) and our main backup repository (Dell Data Domain). I was shocked when we powered everything back up and there wasn't a single data corruption issue (that we have found). In hindsight, I know I should have shut everything down gracefully ahead of time but they assurred me it was routine thing that they do all the time and it wouldn't cause any issues. That should have been the red flag.
 The point of my story is....we've come a long way in recent years in terms of preventing data corruption. I remember a time when pulling the power on a SQL Server while running would almost certainly mean recovering databases from a backup. Chalk one up for progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning fellow nerds and geeks,
 I need some advice on my career trajectory. I've been working for a company for 10 years and I recently moved into a management slot overseeing our department. It's a small shop, but a really good company and I was really enjoying it.
 Fast forward to a few weeks back, and we were bought out. It's looking like I'm going to be back in a sys admin position. While it's not terrible considering I have the same wage, seniority, and WFH, I'm concerned it'll hurt me moving back into a management slot. I'm concerned that the longer I'm out of the position, the harder it'll be to move back up.
 What is your experience with this? Is my concern unfounded, or should I start looking again? We've not moved over to the new company just yet, but it looks like there's no management slots available and likely won't be for some time. The current staff have all been there for a long time and don't look to be moving on anytime soon.

What I want to do is make a inventory system which can be accessed from each of those store locations using a barcode system with a barcode reader and a inventory software. 
 Simply my goal with this software is to see: - Quantity of a certain product by location - the sizes available of the product
 I dont need the software to be linked with the cash register.
 For example if a product is sold. I want to scan the barcode and decrease the quantity of how many of the products is left.
 Or the exact opposite. When new products arrive i want to print a barcode and stick it on the product and then enter it into the inventory system.
 I understand that for this i will need
  
multiple barcode scanners
 barcode printer
  
Have you guys ever worked with this type of software and also which software is the best and cheapest for this system.

 I work for a mid-sized company of about 160 users.
 We're currently looking for a secure web gateway kind of product. We previously ran a POC of Netskope, but this didn't turn out very well for us. We've looked at other solutions such as Zscaler, Perimeter81 and Cloudflare One, but I'm curious to know what others have used in this space and how effective those products have been.
 The main things we are looking for are:
  
Filtering traffic(DNS, HTTP, Network based, etc..)
 Can provide some kind of secure access to non-public facing web apps.
 Has some kind of Malware filter for web traffic.
 Detects shadow IT usage. - Defender for cloud apps does some of this, but doesn't seem super robust.
  
Thanks everyone.

 Printer works fine on other laptops, his laptop works with other USB devices, no AV or Firewall blocking it. The only thing I noticed is it once said low USB power when I initially started troubleshooting so I got a powered USB dock but no joy. Also tried various USB cables.
 Just wondered if anyone had any thoughts? I've sent the laptop to Dell but it's come back saying USB ports are fine (which I assumed).

 I would like to stop using AD admins for logging on to systems - for this I would like to create an AD group that will be set up via GPO as local admin on our servers&clients.
 Even though there are no admins that are only assigned to certain areas - does it still make sense to create one AD group for clients and one for servers + 2x individual users that can either access all servers or clients as local admin?

 My team has recently expanded from a couple of people to a much larger group. We now need to securely store some passwords and logons that the team collectively need, eg for accessing administration websites. I am looking for a suitable piece of software (Win Server) or website that would allow us to store these securely and ensure access for the team, while allowing us to grant / restrict access to specific individuals. Ideally this would be cheap, or free, as we are education/public sector.

 On the github page OP said to change values one has to go to
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin 
 But after installing the app, that key does not appear in that path (or any other path), so do I have to create it manually?
 I also wrote some PS code to create the key if its not there with my veeery limited PS syntax knowledge and some AI, but it also doesnt seem to work. While it does install the app (if its in the same directory as the script for now), it does not create the key.
 $software = "MakeMeAdmin 2.3.0 x64.msi" $msiPath = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot $software if (Test-Path $msiPath) { Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList "/i `"$msiPath`" /quiet /passive" if (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ProductFilter -Filter "Name='$software'") { Write-Output "'$software' is installed." # Create the MakeMeAdmin key if it does not exist if (!(Test-Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin")) { New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\" -Name "MakeMeAdmin" -Force | Out-Null } # Set the AdminRightTimeout value to 60 minutes New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin" -Name "AdminRightTimeout" -Value "60" -PropertyType DWORD -Force } else { Write-Output "'$software' NOT installed." } } else { Write-Output "MSI package '$software' not found." } 
 Sorry if the post sounds confusing, I am lost myself rn haha

 Please bare with me as my windows admin experience is nonexistent. At the corp. I work for, they are largely a windows shop and while they have been generous to provide admin rights on developer machine. Basically their development process is very manual and limited automation.
 So trying to get automation in is rather challenging due to the firewall. EG: I cannot use terraform as trying to use it from the terminal fails due to the proxy settings. Similar for minikube or pulling from the docker hub. In December there was some screw up because I could actually pull docker containers from hub.docker.com. When speaking to the infosec people they keep telling me we need static IP's so that they can allow those sites. However trying to find out who can assign static IP's just results in the run around. 
 Surely there is a way with windows group policies to allow developers in that policy to get access to terraform/npm/docker?
 I think the firewall solution is from fortinet if that helps with suggestions.

 Many thanks

 we are using a Slack-App to do our permission management. The user fils a short form, a superior and myself accept the form & then I set the permissions manually on our Domain Controller (which is a Synology NAS). 
 So now I want to get this automated. The goal would be to only hit the "accept" button in the slack-app and the permission for the user get set automatically and also get removed after a set date.
 I don't really know how to do this technically.
 Maybe you have an idea or direction on how to achieve this, so I can do some further research. :)

My last experiences with Alcatel were not the best, with them being tedious and slow to configure, but that was about 12 years ago. We primarily use Cisco and Dell for core and access switches these days and I am currently thinking about sticking to what we know best or just going with Alcatel to save money. We are planing to use stacked 48 Port 1G PoE Switches as access switches and 48 Port 25G switches witch MLAG as core switches.
 What are your thoughts and experiences with Alcatel?
 Features that are important for us (apart from stability and support of course):
  
configuration through a CLI interface which can be automated with ansible
 stacking for access switches, MLAG for core switches
 a solid 802.1X implementation with multi-host support

 I'm preparing to setup Linux VM deployment for our application team, the goal is to setup a basic VM via template and then deploy the OS and all standard configurations automatically.
 The distros will vary, depending on the requirements, but overall they will deploy Ubuntu (22.04 or 20.04) and RHEL (probably 9, maybe 8).
 For lifecycle management like updates and config changes we will probably be using Ansible, but how could I automate the deployment process across those distributions?
 I am aware of kickstart, but afaik this is a Fedora/RHEL based tool, would it be possible to deploy Ubuntu as well?
 I'm asking this, because Ubuntu has it's own deployment tools, if I get this right, which is Autoinstall/Cloud-Init, and I would prefer to use only one method for both distros.
 What would be the best approach to this, otherwise?
 I'm sorry if something seems unclear, I'm pretty new to linux administration (dipping into it right now)
 All answers appreciated!

 I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, if it's not I'll remove my post.
 My boss asked me to remove all local admin users from the domain. Doesn't seem too hard so that's going to be easy. The hard part is supporting the users which have the local admin accounts.
 Some users need to change their IPv4-Address to work with servers. I fixed this with the local group Windows 10 has which is called "Network Configuration Operators". All users which need to change their IPv4 Address are automatically added in this Group via a Group Policy.
 Now I wanted to know if I can do the same thing with allowing users to create bootable USB-Drives and give them the permission to partition USB-Disk Partitions. 
 I checked the builtin Windows 10 groups but didn't find a group which could enable this. Maybe someone can help me with this?
 Thanks in advance!
 Sorry for my bad english, english isn't my first language.

 Any tips on designing them in P-Touch editor and getting the alignment to keep when transferring them to the labeler templates for use on the device? We can use the software or the app, but it's so nice when it does work that you can just enter in a pre-set field or two and it prints the same everytime.
 For a simple two line label, with two "titles" the alignment never lines up.
 I know some of you guys use p-touch so thought I'd ask before I pull my hair out over a darn labeler.

 Just about any routing feature I’d need is present, not to mention the performance is pretty impressive.
 One of the things I don’t see in FRR’s documentation, and this was confirmed by some of the FRR devs as well, is there’s no Netflow/IPFIX/Sflow capabilities.
 Obviously FRR is intended to be a routing suite, and that’s understandable, but has anyone here using FRR found a library for this purpose on Debian that is actively maintained and has enough flexibility to be considered viable for being used alongside FRR?

 Just curious on how everyone running older equipment…or Cat9200s…supporting auto-install mode are doing ZTP with DHCP. Specially in regards to DHCP scopes where native VLANs don’t exist.
 At all of our locations everything is tagged and a defunct/unused native VLAN is used.
 And idea I had was to create a small network just for the ZTP configuration on the branch router and then just abandon it afterwards.
 Curious how everyone else does it?

This site was quite helpful, but I discovered that I had a hard time coming up with fake users, fake documents, and the like to make it actually look like an internal company network that was in use.
 Whilst doing this, I thought to ask ChatGPT for some help on the matter, and the results were quite helpful. I gave the prompt:
  
I'm trying to learn how to become a sys-admin, in order to do this I'm creating a homelab in VMware, I want this homelab to be a realistic simulation of an SMB, please generate some fake, but reasonable information about this fictional SMB that I'm emulating for training purposes. 
  
It gave me some excellent data that would likely take me forever to think of on my own. It included names of employees, their good/bad passwords, company details like location and size, it even gave me data about the technology they used!
 I've seen people use ChatGPT for writing scripts or fixing problems, but with dubious accuracy. Alot of the solutions are good, but it seems about half of them contain some manner of issues and inaccuracies. However, it seems that ChatGPT's excellence in making up BS can actually be used for good!
 EDIT: Let it be known that ChatGPT's accuracy is sometimes a bit better than half, but in all fairness I wouldn't trust it enough to justify some peoples uses for it. Although generating reasonable, but fake information seems to have a 100% chance of working.

We were a necessary evil but IT wasn't something that the company liked to spend money on. We were running on shoestring budgets and poor leadership. We were expected to move mountains and were in constant fire fighter mode. 
 The new organization is much more mature and more resourced. The IT team appears to be at least 10 times the size of the previous company. Everything is organized, automated and cutting edge. There are clear expectations and IT appears to be highly regarded by the leadership team. 
 My initial reaction was feeling like there is nothing for me to do at the new company since there aren't any burning fires to put out but I realized that this new environment and change in culture offers me time to actually grow. I can actually focus and learn new things rather than run from one problem to another. 
 Just wondering how others have gone through this experience. My hope is that I will be able to really level up in the new role.

 The whole split has been poorly managed from the start and about a year ago one of the seniors set up an AWS account, gave a group of us the keys and admin rights and then resigned. Since then, we've built out a set of automation tools and apps. Over time, I've tried to take over system administration and have focused on learning about its security.

 Anyone year who’s been working for 10+ years and still enjoys it? Do you still like learning about new stuff and working on a homelab and what not?
 It’s also weird cause so many of those folks that work non-tech jobs like farming end up wanting to learn to code and switch to a desk job after 10 years.

 Is there a way like with IMAP accounts I can get it to point to the "old" exchange server? I have tried the old autodiscover with the IP Address in hosts file then adding account on same machine but still points to new exchnage (M365)?

 (This is for prepping cable for fusion splicing).
 They both appear to be 3-hole fiber optic strippers, and from the specs I can see, they strip the same diameters.
 Is one newer or older than the other?
 Does anybody have any personal preferences, with any reasons between these?
 (I saw Knipex also makes some fiber optic strippers - Knipex 12 82 130 SB and Knipex 12 85 110 SB, however, there don't seem to be many reviews for them, and I assume they're not as well known as the Miller gear)

 I was wondering if anyone had advice for software for scanning a network for live devices.
 I currently use advanced IP scanner but it doesn’t placate pull through users. The company I work for is actively trying to reduce our electricity by having users power down on a Friday. It’s not happening though as on Monday mornings they don’t like waiting, when I run advanced up scanner it tells me machine names etc but not always the users. 
 Sadly My predecessors didn’t keep note of machine names and who they went to so it would take ages to sit and go through things.

We currently uses a very heavily Customized version of Dynamic AX and we'd like to upgrade to a new ERP system that replicates as much of this as possible so we don't have to maintain and import all of our customizations.
 A lot of emphasis on the features and input process for Sales Orders to make it easy to input with huge numbers of size/color/fabric and customization variations.
 And also to manage the many stages that are involved in creating the custom apparel for the people involved in actually producing them at each stage.
 We also have a lot of custom reports, so it would be great to have a good BI system, separate data warehouse so that running reports doesn't affect performance of the main system.
 We are about 300 employees and growing.

 I am looking to a easy to use alternative that is hopefully open source, but my search results are all turning up kaput. I see a lot of talk about group policies and temporary accounts. I'm not too verse on those. Right now the lab is set up as 32 bare metal computers with an admin and a student account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently I was asking a question about how to fix Grub if I'm installing Windows after Ubuntu. I found the solution. But now I want to ask about aftermaths of boot-repair. So, my system was working like this before:
  
Ubuntu with Grub
 Windows on hdd
  
So what I did is I unplugged every drive, I installed Windows on new m2 ssd, connected old hdd (where my old windows was located), transfered all data and formatted hdd so it's now just a storage for windows. Then I connected ssd with my ubuntu and run boot-repair from my usb flash. After that grub got fixed and I can choose between new Windows and Ubuntu, and it's all working.
 But one thing that bothers me is that there's still old Windows left on grub menu, even tho I formatted old hdd with Windows. Also in UEFI there were added more options to boot from, like ubuntu (m2 ssd) and ubuntu (hdd) even tho ubuntu is not installed there at all. I have the logs from boot-repair saved, if they're safe to share, I can share them. Also I can screenshot my partitions if it's needed, just tell me what to run, I'm not a pro in such things, and it seems like no-one in other communties can help me (I asked this question many times), so please don't delete the question, because last time I asked here something, it got deleted even tho it didn't violate any rules, but I was lucky enough to get the answer before it got deleted, so I came here again, as my last hope, not trying to violate anything.
 My question is, should I be worried about something? Or it's not of a big deal and I can forget about it? It also says when I'm booting to Ubuntu "failed to set APST feature" and something starts going on, and eventually it loads after a little time and works fine, new Windows on m2 ssd works fine too.

 TL:DR. I've been a sysadmin for four years now. We have no endpoint management, no ticket systems, nothing. I don't even have access to email administration. Employees ignore documentation, instructions, security rules. The supervisor and CEO doesn't want to implement anything or respond to it in any way. How do I convince CEO to give permission to do something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a recent networking grad working for a big bank. I remember as a student delving into automation, everything was new and interesting. I had a lot of fun setting up small topologies in GNS3 and automating commands with Ansible and Nornir.
 Now that I’ve started my career, I’m very interested (from a selfish point of view but also as a way to increase my skills) in taking my automation skills to the next level.
 I’m under no illusions that throwing Python scripts to automate some config changes does not make me some automation wizard. Anyone with a keen interest in learning automation can get to that point in no time at all.
 With that being said, I’d really appreciate some seasoned automation people to share cool ideas they’ve implemented. 
 I was thinking of looking into how to create a web GUI that takes in a command and runs them against some specified devices. But then I think Ansible Tower is pretty similar to that, so I don’t think that would be the best return on time for me to create that (bearing in mind it’d take me a long time to learn how to create web GUIs).
 This post was borne out of a desire to understand how to get to the next level. As I’m working for a large enterprise with many networking colleagues, I want to be able to build automation tools that others can use, not just some one-off Python scripts.

 For a week or two I plan to run both concurrently, in a primary/failover scenario, while I make sure everything is solid.
 I've always had IPv6 via DHCP-PD; I know the new ISP provides IPv6 as well (it was able to pull a v6 address), including PD (based on reading).
 I set up the router to grab PD from both WANs, but so far it's only pulling/using the primary ISP.
 I've been looking around, and I see that multi-wan PD is perhaps a common issue... then it occurred to me that perhaps it's not even possible, given that such a configuration would essentially multi-home each host (right?).
 so my question is simple - is it even possible to use DHCPv6-PD from multiple ISPs without using BGP?
 Thanks in advance!

 I work in IT for a company that has in the last few months been plagued by an update that has made it so nearly every computer we own now auto-locks after 2-5 minutes. We have opened up a support ticket with Microsoft and they deny anything is wrong, but other companies have agreed with us that this is new and is affecting them as well.
 To try and bypass this new "feature" we have tried: 
  
rolling back the update - Didn't work
 modifying power plan settings - didn't work 
 Power plan advanced settings - didn't work
 
 Windows settings - didn't work
 Various registry edits - didn't work*
 Disabling Windows Dynamic Lock (this is normally disabled by our policy anyway, but that's a whole other story) - didn't work
 Disabling Dell Optimiser on computers that have it - Didnt work
  
There are no settings in our Azure AD tenant, group policy, or on-prem domain that pertain to screen saver and screen lock timers
 * we did find a registry key that disables the computer's ability to lock entirely (including using Win+L), but this poses a security issue for obvious reasons and so we aren't going this route. 
 So far the only thing I have found was earlier today when I was working on this issue is that my windows screen saver settings auto default back to five minutes even after changing the settings AND modifying the registry key to set the screen saver up to 15 minutes.
 I also found that my computer's screen will lock after 2 minutes but when I boot in safe mode it goes. up to 5. 
 We now have upper management breathing down our necks because everyone is complaining about this issue and the CIO is trying to fend everyone off the best they can while we figure this out but nothing is working.
 Does anybody have ANY ideas because we're at wits end here.

 I have quotes from people from using KVM to VMware, but I can't get funding for a completely new VM system. (Was quoted $45k-150K depending on vendor for 3 host 20 vm load with backup)
 I need to get this as cheap as possible (<$5k) with reliability.
 The demand of the system is very very low. We have probably 80 windows clients that are AD joined, and use the DNS service. It also syncs to Azure and runs google script (I know it should be a PAW, but right now don't have the vm to do this).
 Part of me thinks, okay bare metal, how few times anything has actually failed, it is likely to be fine.
 Throw together a box, install, and go.
 But the gnawing part of me says, do VM. But what part of VM makes sense unless a 2nd host can run it (Azure/AWS for backup?) and the storage is accessable.. (without spending on NAS/SAN, have a removeable raid 1 storage so it can go to another device)?
 Anyone have ideas on the minimal install for a server? Is proxmox or such worthwhile with small workstations that are under 2k each?

 Much of my research around getting started in this field suggests learning an OS in-and-out, a close-second is learning a scripting language. Because I work in a Windows environment, it's sensible to start with Windows and PowerShell. This makes sense, but I don't know how to go about tackling the former. 
 There are some books, like Powershell for SysAdmins, that can teach me Windows administration through PowerShell--hitting two birds with one stone. Is this advisable or should I begin by learning Windows core processes and its other components independently of PowerShell so I don't get overwhelmed?
 I fear I'm overthinking this, and I'd welcome that constructive criticism if that's what's going on. Helping me develop this area of my roadmap would be much appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I’m looking at options to simplify the management of multiple accounts across multiple tenants for our executive team. 
 Our execs will use accounts in the following separate tenants managed by separate IT teams:
 MrExec@company1.com MrExec@company2.com MrExec@company3.com
 They need to be able to send and receive mail on all 3 accounts but only really need to be fully Microsoft licensed on their primary. Currently they have licenses in all 3 and open 3 separate mailboxes in Outlook with various forwarding rules etc set up.
 Ideally it would be much simpler for them to manage with one account and mailbox and just use aliases from the other tenants but I haven’t been able to find any good docs on how to do that or if it’s even possible. Tenants have to stay as separate entities due to the way the companies are silo’d. 
 Looking for recommendations on how to do this simpler/better! Thank you

 Anyway...We’re doing some IT work for a friend and we need to replace an aging PC where Atrium is installed. I’m aware that in addition to the Atrium software itself there’s also a SQL database behind. Not sure if there are other dependencies or not. I have the Atrium software install for the new PC, but what steps are required to get everything transferred and running on the new PC while retaining all existing settings\access and of course not “breaking” anything.
 I was thinking the steps would be something like this. Or am I way off base here?
  
Backup existing SQL database
 Install Atrium software on new PC
 Restore database backup on new PC.

Instead of using our software imaging (Quest KACE) to save a bit of time I showed our desktop techs that they can simply put in the Windows 10 Enterprise key from our software licensing (we have an enterprise agreement) which saves the time on having to re image. They like the idea of saving time but also liked that the image answered the Windows installation questions from the Unattend.xml file I built within KACE scripted installations (we want to move away from KACE K2000 and don't have SCCM).
 What I want to know is if it is possible to put an answer file of any sort into one of these new Dell machines to answer all the basics and setup a simple admin user so they can then get on the domain right away and start working.
 I have tried pulling the command prompt at OOBE load (Shift + F10) and have thrown an Unattend.xml file in both the C:\Windows\Panther and C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep folders but nothing happened as I had hoped.
 Any ideas? I hope this is clear enough, please ask any questions for clarification.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perfect way to ruin your weekend. I took this job 5 months ago as internal IT guy. Came into a place that has fat clients everywhere with no servers and everything MS365 cloud/onedrive. Passwords are flying around all over the place. And yes, they also used (and still use) Lastpass, which is, as we all know, compromised. When I came there, there were NO BACKUPS. Boss thought they were unnecessary because "everything is taken care of by Microsoft". It took me 2 months to convince him that he was wrong about that. So I did implement a backup system which is running now. Also took care of other stuff and was testing out Intune for consistent MDM deployment.
 Boss was also global admin himself and fucks around with permissions and settings, causing problems that I don't understand because he doesn't tell me what he changed.
 He also has this minion dude that works a couple hours a week and barely knows how to install a computer.
 So yesterday I get called in and get this 3 page letter stating that I'm doing everything wrong, got my priorities wrong, I meddle in things that I should not meddle in, I'm watching Netflix at work on my laptop, which is a complete lie, and I'm not following orders. I'm not 21, I'm 52 with a ton of experience who's jaw dropped when he said that he didn't need any backups.
 So at the end of the talk, he says he withdraws my admin rights. So now I can't do anything. "Sure you can, just pick out the roles that you need". The little minion still retains rights.
 The little minion also says that I did not share the backup account password with him. I did. He looked in the wrong column of the spreadsheet.
 What the hell should I do?

 i have installed Oracle Linux 9.1 and then FreeRADIUS, added both the WLC and APs as clients, used a test user but no dice, when adding a windows machine as a client and test with NTRadPing i get accepted message, but when connecting to the AP nothing happens.
 on both FreeRADIUS and WLC the config is up to cisco documentation, but there is no communication between the two. i am sure i am missing something stupid but i cant put my finger on it.
 any help is appreciated because i am starting to feel really stupid for failing such a basic task.

 So I'm still not very well documented regarding SCCM handling.

This is to give some leeway week for the patches to be trialed on the test group in the first weekend. Is there a logical way to do so? Because the current setup is to manually input non-recurring MW for each damn month of the year...

 On a related note: I had to work 16 hours today. I’m holed up in a hotel and have to work tomorrow for what I’m suspecting to be another 10ish hours. We’re migrating a bunch of new users. I’ve never felt less like this was for me than I do right now. How is this my job? Meanwhile I have friends who are fully remote and making bank working at their leisure.
 Guess this rant went a bit off the rails. I just don’t know want this to be my life going forward. This wasn’t what I signed up for when I took this job. Wish I could just catch my big break like my friends did.

 I am finishing up a migration from Intermedia (hosted Exchange) to Office 365. I have almost everything set up, but am facing a stumbling block. If you have any idea how to fix it or even another way of doing things, I'd appreciate your advice.
 To preface, our public folders contain mailbox enabled folders that have their own aliases that external users e-mail regularly. Our current setup allows only users assigned a public folders role to have access to see the public folders as its own entity under folders in their Outlook client. No one else sees it. For the migration, we are using BitTitan.
 In Office 365, I set up the public folder and using BitTitan, migrated the stuff over. I set explicit permissions using the public folder GUI in the Exchange admin center. However, everyone is seeing the public folders as if it's a shared mailbox shared with everyone. I've found out how to limit unauthorized users from accessing the content, but the public folder mailbox remains. Any ideas of how to get rid of the mapping entirely for certain users?

It's ranged from a simple UI bug that provides incorrect instruction that would lead to an outage, to a poorly designed and documented system that will lead to a legitimate loss of data. I've heard responses from "voice your concern in the community forum and let people vote on it" to "that's just how it's going to work, it's up to you to deal with possible data loss"
 I don't regret cloud services...I don't want to be thinking about CPU, storage, rackspace, maintenance windows, etc for every application I'm tasked with, but i do think that the exorbitant subscription licensing costs should provide some equal amount of product improvement and support. Maybe I've been huffing too much of the cloud not knowing it's just smoke?

 not one to post but grasping at straws here so thought i would ask reach out and ask!
 i have an application installed in three different environments (current prod, test, to be new prod). Now the current prod is running an older version of the app, test and to be new prod are up to date. current prod is able to email out utilizing direct send (mx record), test is able to do the same thing. to be new prod is unable to send (too man recipients error) Volume is low so i know its not a limit issue. Low being 5-10 per day if that...each environment is in an isolated zone and confirmed no deny alerts when attempting to send, in fact we see the outbound connection as successful. now what am i missing? is this an 0365 issue (have opened a ticket just in case). The app vendor has been stumped by this as well..

 Kinda novice on this, I am building a windows 11 image for rollout. I understand that an "image" is not the most modern way to do it but I'm on a very limited time schedule. My question is about copyprofile in the autounattend.xml file. On Microsoft's website it says that if you use copyprofile you need to delete certain registry entries after the fact using regedit. You need to load it up, open a hive etc. Is there an easy way to accomplish this over command line so it can be automated?
 Thanks

 I've tried to find documentation on this, but it's not in the manual. My concerns are:
 -Will this create a loop? Does STP even work on the OOB int?
 -Does doing this provide the expected solution, where if member 1 fails, the stack can still be managed via the OOB interface on the second member.
 -Would the management IP somehow move to the other OOB int?

What happens is that your eyes may roll and get stuck when they get a glimpse of the captain of your brain for guidance, but he’s having the same problem, and his captain is having the same problem (etc) thus causing a multi dimensional recursive state. Eventually your neural stack overflows.
 But take comfort, your brain will reboot. You will try to reprocess events, but those poor neurons are fried. And don’t bother talking about the problem to anyone; it’s scrap code that will only give more form to a problem that should not exist.
 Don’t complain at all. It isn’t going to add any sense. Just put that little layer 8 object in a box, and push it into the sea of your mind, toward the waters where DNS probably lurks.

 Was wondering if I could get another perspective on this issue that suddenly occurred. It's got me scratching my head as well as a colleague of mine. So, here's the scenario...
 I've got about 20 Adtran Netvantas situated through my network. My admin AD account creds work just fine in all of them. In each switch, there's a local "sadmin" user created that has worked fine up until last night. 
 I was in a new switch last night using "sadmin" getting ready to config RADIUS on it and suddenly my sadmin account failed on me when I had to SSH back in. Strangely enough, I then discovered that the "sadmin" creds failed on all my switches. This account is not an AD account, so that's why it's got us puzzled... 
 service password-encryption
 !
 username "sadmin" password encrypted "2e225c6676944cbfe03d03126a45db4dbeae" 
 Any insight and/or suggestions as to why this suddenly happened across all my switches would be appreciated. TIA folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started a management gig at a K12 school and one of the items on my agenda is to modernise the switching within the school.
 Currently we are mostly Aruba switching with a mix of Cisco switches in nodes around the school. Our core switch is Cisco however most of our major nodes are Aruba.
 So here is the issue; our state govsrment is overhauling our wireless and providing a replacement for every wireless access point and these will ALL be cisco as well as a Cisco WLC. 
 I would like to start using smart monitoring software like Juniper Mist, Cisco DNS or HP Airwave but I am under the assumption that we everything will need to be the same vendor for this to be clean and effective.
 The other issue is that the team im not leading has very limited switching experience and in order to Change that I'd like to get them used to a specific vendors way of doing something first.
 Has anyone got any advice on which vendor to go with for switching? Do I have a problem if I mix switches and want to use the software? Or am I making this a bigger issue than it needs to be.
 So to sum up I am considering: CISCO HP Aruba JUNIPER UBIQUITI 
 NOTE: Assume budget is no issue and we are just aiming for the best possible setup.

 Last year, one project that was on hold was the replacement of the current switchboard for the reception / call center (three people) that is currently running with a very old solution, I'm not going into details but it doesn't do much except receiving calls and displaying all users on a virtual switchboard.
 All other users are on Teams and it's working good for them.
 The problems we currently have is that overall, the switchboard solution doesn't know anything about users on Teams ; it doesn't know if they are on call, away or simply offline.
 About 2 months ago I was approached by a vendor for an integrated solution that basically works "below" teams as a virtual PBX that can tehn route calls to Teams,…]]></summary>

 My main concern is, are we going to have to completely tear down the Fabric site and essentially rebuild each site from scratch? 
 I know in the past we have replaced switches with the same model and that worked fine but I don't see using the "mark for replacement" feature working in this case. 
 Just seeing if anyone has gone through this yet at all. Posted in the cisco community forum a couple weeks ago but no responses yet there either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks, been lurking on this sub for a while but this is my first post.
 Been in a Network Engineer/Network Admin role for 3+ years. Mostly for smaller scale government networks. I've made it to the final round of interviews for a position as an MPLS engineer.
 I feel confident about some of the things they want, like L2 switching, L3 routing, OSPF/BGP and Cisco familiarity. The problem is that I haven't touched MPLS professionally in a while, and when I did it was on the customer end. The company I'm interviewing with is a provider. Aside from a core understanding of MPLS, I've also been told they're going to want to talk about: Segment Routing, Pseudowire, VRF, VPRN, VPLS, EVPN, 1588, and TWAMP. They've also mentioned the ISIS routing protocol which I'm not too familiar with.
 I understand the theory of MPLS and I've been individually researching these other topics. I was wondering if you guys know any solid video series, courses/labs, or books that would cover most or all of these things under the MPLS umbrella. The interview is next week so my aim is not to sound like a complete clown when I talk about MPLS. Any advice appreciated!

 Network for reference: (Edit: I tried to do spacing here but it didnt work. SW1 has SW 2 and 3 below. SW 2 has 4 and 5 below and SW3 has 6 and 7 below)
 SW1
 SW2 SW3
 SW4 SW5 SW6 SW7
 I am currently trying to gain insight in a network and to do that we are installing a sensor on SW1. We then used RSPAN get all traffic from all of the lower switches up to SW1 for the local SPAN. Currently SW6 and SW7 have remote VLAN 111 going to SW3. But once we try forwarding SW3 to SW1 using VLAN 111 it creates a loop and sends a copy back to SW6 and SW7 since the trunk allows the VLAN both ways.
 Any solutions to this issue?
 We are thinking of having RSPAN on SW4, 5, 6 and 7 use VLAN 111 and then configure RSPAN on SW2 and 3 to use VLAN 112 so that way the traffic is only able to go one direction. Not sure if this would work.
 Thanks all!

Today's theft is surprisingly early, so it must have been a boozy lunch. Because of this, I am going to have someone on our junior staff create a training session on how to avoid getting your shit stolen while having a drinking session after work. Back in my party days I used to hook the strap of my backpack through a part of the chair and never got my bag stolen. What kind of tips or funny ideas do you have for a presentation to help people avoid getting their shit stolen while their necking a handful of lagers back at the pub? We have a young party culture with a lot of remote travel/work with clients that pay VERY well, so the old school grizzled administrator answers about making them pay for it or not bring their laptops home won't be helpful.

 I have a quick question for those of you using Anyconnect VPN on ASA/FTD.
 When you upload Anyconnect images to the VPN appliance, do upload only the latest version that your company uses or all possible images that are present in your enviroment?
 Is there a reason to upload older versions on the firewall at all?
 Only thing I can think of is the recent bug in Anyconnect that triggers auto update even if it's disabled in the XML.
 Another reason could be related to XML scheme that might change some parameters between releases of the supplicant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Corel acquired Roxio. We ran into a strange issue with a Roxio product and reached out to their support. Hands down, the most incompetent group of "technicians" I've encountered in ~20 years of working in IT.
 Our ticket was escalated to the higher tier of support and they initially attempted to help. But once none of their recommendations worked, they said "Unfortunately your product version is no longer supported."
 I replied saying that can't possibly be true, as you all are still actively selling the product. So they backtrack and ask, "May I know proof of purchase?" To which I responded that we no longer have the receipt. But sent them the activation key, the email used to originally purchase the software, and a screenshot logged into said account on our registered products page.
 From here, they send, "Another user may be able to help you get an answer in one of the forums" to which they provide a link that just goes to their parent company's main page with no forums mentioned anywhere.
 So I inform them of this... and the response? "May I know proof of purchase" - same exact guy I have been speaking to this whole time. 
 I open a second ticket in an attempt to get a different technician. Specifically ask not to get "Mr. XYZ" and I end up back with him anyways. We have the exact same conversation mentioned above and this is a never ending loop. We got so frustrated we decided to say fuck that software and bought a similar one from a different vendor.
 TL:DR - Corel bought Roxio. Their support sucks dick for gas money, and then rides their bike.

 Employees are encouraged to work from home and need to appear only twice a week. Max capacity of 60 devices running fully on cloud apps at the premisesas well. No local file servers, no VoIP, no email servers, none of that legacy tech. So floating population of employees using unassigned desks with only docking stations and monitors that connect to company issued chromebooks for better productivity. 
 All client devices i.e chromebooks, tablets, mobile phones, new printers will run over wifi.
 Though we feel WiFi should work here if implemented properly. What are the biggest issues to be weiry of? What would the challenges be when scaling up the number of clients in the future?

 When configuring Radius/User/Privileges, there is no option to set the privilege level of Radius users. When Radius users login, they have no privileges which makes the user basically useless.
 I've reached out to our account team and the manufacturer and they report that the underlying SDK doesn't allow for them to set the privilege level of Radius users and we would need to use TACACS.
 Surely this can't be the case. Radius authentication without the ability to use the Radius user? No VSA, template user, default privilege adjustment? I have to create a user locally before it can be useful?
 Somebody tell me this isn't true.

For example they have purchased media devices for online TV but with these devices you can only enter the WiFi password which obviously will not work.
 I've reached out the provider about the issue and they told me just open up the web browser on these media devices to authenticate which I keep telling them it doesn't work that way. Has anyone dealt with similar issue or this type of issues at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I am currently work in a Network Engineer role for a small MSP. I'm looking to take my networking skills and move towards network automation / DevOps role. Any tips or things to study to start to navigate towards that direction? I have device experience with bigger vendors already (Cisco, Juniper, Fortigate, Meraki & etc) so I'm ready a little familiar with Python via Cisco. Also, if there are any certs or things to better my resume, I'm always down to get more certs!
 A little history: Been in the network field 5+ yrs. I currently have CCTRS, CCNA & JNCIA. I learned deeper protocols and Troubleshooting working for an ISP then moving to this MSP got more advanced with firewalls and internal routing protocols. I was considering getting the Cisco DevNet then continuing to CCNP vía that route but I heard it doesn't hold much weight in careers right now. 
 Any advice is beneficial! Thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has me looking into and meeting with Front App. We are a logistics company and the volume of email we get is tremendous, we receive around 100k emails a day for a 150 person company. A lot of it is emails going to multiple people because of how teams and distribution groups are setup.
 I have sent out training to users on how to create rules and manage the volume of mail with retention policies and even showing them how they can bulk delete them selves online, but it seems to be getting too much and users aren't following direction. We have tried shared mailboxes for some teams, but due to the volume of mail and people accessing it, it tends to crash outlook and does more harm then good. 
 I have a meeting with Front's technical team, just want to know if anyone has tried to make the transition to a software like this and is there anything I am looking over? And or how have you overcome the problem of high volumes of email?
 Concerns I have:
  
We have around 1000 distribution groups which we would have to use Microsoft's SMTP settings for each distribution group and would be a manual setup for each. The other option is using Front and their servers and updating our SPF/DKIM records, though then Microsoft will then not have a record of those outbound emails.
 Adds another point of failure for email, as now if Front goes down everything will be forwarded to their system.
 Learning curve for end users, we would have to switch around 80% of our company to this.

 1. Can I use the RMI+RP under the redundancy settings for these devices even though they are on different subnets? If not, any other ideas for HA?
 2. On the initial deployment of the .ova, there was a step where we could have put in the S/N and PnP information. Is that necessary for full functionality? If so, where do I find the S/N?

 I have 4 users on Mac's that I need to export their mail from and then import that mail into their new email address which is a completely different domain name. If I'm remembering correctly, Mac can't export to PST and it's an OLM file (I think?) 
 User 1 = 48GB
 User 2 = 47GB
 User 3 = 20GB
 User 4 = 70GB (I thought 50gb was the max but here we are)
 Normally on a PC I would just export to PST and then import into their new account in Outlook. I feel like is outdated and there might be a different or better way to do this? I know PST's can get corrupted during the export/import process so this whole process feels fragile. 
 Any ideas, suggestions, tips or wild ass guesses are welcome. I've considered joining the French Foreign Legion to avoid this so that is always an option. 
 Thank you!

 I'm going to be sitting in for an interview (virtual) in a few hours and I'm pretty nervous.
 It's for a Network Computer Support Technician position.
 Here are some of the PD:
 The Tier 1 maintenance of the on-site ADCS systems and subsystems, performing preventive and corrective maintenance and monitoring the on-site and remote locations. 
 Operations and maintenance of communications/computer systems and networks.
 Installs communications/computer systems in accordance with the respective installation spec.
 Troubleshooting and support of communications systems/networks.
 Working knowledge of Cisco system support/maintenance, VMware ESXi system support/maintenance, Active Directory, Windows Server 2019, HBSS, ACAS, SQL, SolarWinds, and Splunk preferred.
 Terminate ADCS circuits activated at the node point-of-presence (POP).
 I have my Net+ and Sec+ but not much experience other than doing some A+ stuff at a small PC shop in highshcool
 Any tips for the interview would be greatly appreciated!

 Every so often I'll notice two user accounts in our domain with VERY similar names, usually one character is different (e.g. Jon Smith/John Smith/John Smyth). You can tell they're the same person because their Office, Job Title, Department, even their unique employee number is the same.
 How on earth do I go about finding them without just poring through a list of 3500+ users? Is there an Excel function I can use?

Our compliance team mentioned that a requirement they've been issued by one of our auditors is to provide print verification, so sensitive print jobs don't just get left at the printer for anyone to pick up (finance reports, etc). We've considered both PIN verification at the printer's display panel, or badge scanning.
 Those of you who have set this up, what method are you using and what were the hardware requirements. Are you using a print server, and if so, what software are you running and is it on-prem or cloud based? If you're using badge scanning, what model of scanner are you using? Any information you could provide on your setup would be helpful, I'm just trying to get a lay of the land before I make any big decisions on server hardware or software contracts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have problem with EAP-TLS on Cisco ISE. Access to our WiFi is based on machine certificates. Computers with Windows OS use Anyconnect supplicant and it works good. But problem is with MacOSX. Anyconnect supplicant is not supporting this system so we need to use built-in supplicant. We try as below:
  
Machine certificate on MacOSX, but by default, iOS and macOS supplicants use the certificate identity common name for the EAP Response Identity it sends to the RADIUS server during 802.1X negotiation. So we get host name as a username - ISE can't find this username and rejecting connection.
 User certificate on MacOSX, but we get error: "EAP-TLS failed SSL/TLS handshake because of an unsupported certificate in the client certificate chain". Enhanced-Key-Usage is "client authentication" because I found that "all purpose" can be blocked.
  
Do you have any idea?

 New R750 and did a normal LifeCycle Controller install of Server 2022 on the bare metal RAID1 BOSS and it's showing a D drive named "OS" that is 2GB FAT in Disk Manager and an E drive labelled "OEMDRV".
 Looks like OEMDRV will disappear by itself but does anyone know what the OS partition and drive letter is all about please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow Sysadmins,
 I would like to take a moment to address all the hardworking Admins and System Engineers who may have faced moments of intense stress while working on critical infrastructure. I want to extend my apologies for potentially wasting your time, but I felt it was important to reach out and share my recent experience.
 Recently, I was working on our ESXi cluster and FC Fabric to add another storage system.
 I had to reload the FC zone, and despite knowing that the other switch should carry the load, the system briefly halted, causing me great concern. My heart raced as I feared the worst, but fortunately, the failover worked as expected.
 I understand that moments like these can be incredibly stressful and can take a toll on one's mental and emotional well-being. I empathize with anyone who has experienced similar situations and want you to know that you are not alone. Let's continue to support each other and work together to ensure that our critical systems remain stable and secure.
 Thank you for all the hard work that you do, and I wish you all the best.

 I used to work in a ~120 heads high tech/cloud computing/manufacturing/ex Start Up (still behaving like one) company in an 1,5 head internal IT department (Doing everything but working on our actual products). Me being the 1 fully busy head.
 Got a support call from a senior cloud engineer [second year in cloud, plus maybe 5 in analytics experience ontop] (Working on the actual product). User needed help setting up new desk, new dock, monitors and all that.
 "Hey, could you please help me? My screens are all kinda messed up. The right one shows the same as the left one..." I right click, open screen settings, change to extended and arrange the screens. "Wow, that was easy. Thanks for showing me yada yada .."
 How dafuq can such a person manage to complete a bachelor's degree in IT?! 
 Imagine them standing in front of the committee of IT Professors, trying to defend their thesis and going: "Hmm, the beamer throws my Power Point notes on the wall, it's not supposed to do that. Could you please call IT support?"
 And the Prof.: "Sure no problemo, let's call them and wait a fucking eternity until they come in and fix this damn beamer. Back in the old days we used overhead Projectors were it was impossible to paste the notes on the wall, because who would be so stupid to print them on the same piece of foil as the presentation. The good old times, am I right?"
 I myself am only working ~6 years in IT (3 years apprenticeship[Ausbildung in Germany], 3 years hands on). But I notice with a lot of new graduate IT colleagues comming from university, their basic skills are just non existent.
 A friend of mine seriously tried to buy network HUBs in his company, because he learned in university that those can transmit data way faster because of the lack of overhead. He got really upset that you can no longer buy those. o_O

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, let me apologize if this is supposed to be something basic to ask but I can't figure out where I can find the right settings. 
 We have started deployment of HP thin clients in our environment and now getting started testing out HP Device Manager. Initially, I installed HP Device Manager on my PC and discovered the thin clients on the network. Now I have installed the HP Device Manager on the server and was also able to discover the same thin client devices from the new server and able to push settings to the thin clients without issue.
 ​
 I am wondering if there is a settings somewhere that once an HP thin client has been discovered and configured, it will only access connections from a sort of "approved HP Device Manager server" and allow it settings to be change when some sort of authentication is done.
 ​
 In terms of security, there is firewall between server subnet and think client subnet that can block unwanted traffic but the issue lies that, in the current state, device on the same broadcast network as the thin client are able to discover the think client.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions and solutions.

 I have 2 job opportunity´s who have offered basically the same salary package. Both work places are 30 minutes away and one has 30 somewhat employees and the other 10.
 One workplace wants me to manage their private cloud which hosts applications and is used across the world. However they only use open source (proxmox, proxmox backup, local emailservers (cant remember the name), nothing in Azure, no m365, only old generation hardware) and windows services (ad, iis, rdp sessions, ...) for clustering and redundancy.
 The other workplace also wants me to manage their datacenter, but mostly go on projects to customers to replace firewalls, servers, storage, migrate AD etc... and uses industry standards (azure, m365, hpe, vmware, hyperv,...) however they are a small company and are less visible in the community. They also have an older standards of the workplace (fixed hours, no remote work) 
 Ive recently been studying and certificating in azure and vmware, and it seems a waste should i choose company 1. Im sure i can get the datacenter migraties to azure and vmware in the future but then ill be working with non industry standards (in my region at least) for at least a couple years. It will be challenging and ill definetly have freedom, but will not gain experience in hardware or cloud technology.
 Company 2 seems a better fit regarding my study and experience, but I fear being invisible in the community.
 Based on this, what option would you go for? I currently work somewhere with a 1 to 2 hour drive so they are tempting offers.

 I have a Lenovo Think System T250 standalone server with Windows Server 2019 that has suddenly become slow. I highly suspect that it is the operating system volume drives (RAID 1, 2 drives) that are causing the issue as performance monitor is detecting high I/O and all else appears fine. There are C and D volumes, each with 2 drives in RAID 1. I plan on replacing the drives volume C with ones with same capacity and higher read/write speeds.
 ​
 What would be the best way to go about changing these drives?
  
Shutting down server, replacing 1 of the drives and starting backup, let it rebuild then do same with second drive.
  
2.Taking image backup of Volume C, shutting down, taking both drives out and replacing with new ones and recover from the image backup with bootable flash drive. Would this cause issue with volume D?
 Or any other suggestions would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am currently developing a multiplayer video game that will be using UDP P2P and I wish to use hole/nat punching to solve the issue with users not having to configure their router ports and/or network settings.
 I've managed to set up a system with a middle hand server that introduces users to each other (I believe it is called a STUN server?). Each user connects to this and a user (client) can request to be matched with another user (host). If a suitable host is found, the host is notified of the client and vice versa, they then start punching each other. This setup seems to work as intended, for most cases at least...
 The problem I am facing is in the case that the hosting user is on a non-public ip adress. The "handshake" via hole punching does not seem to get confirmed and the connection fails.
 Is there some kind of way to solve this issue? A relay server is not really part of the plan as it includes additional latency and costs.
 ​
 Edit: or could this issue not be related to the IP being private and instead be a router issue?

 I end up in systemd networking, netplan, etc/network/interfaces, configuring interfaces manually. Would there be a way I could have a docker container to consolidate this and point applications to a local subnet 127.0.100.1 or 127.0.200.1 and it would have within the container NAT database for mangling those to send over tunnel before the open internet.
 Would I be able to accomplish something similar to this in docker when I would give each application machines a /29 or /28 for multiple addresses it needs to reference and translate?

 the ISR1111 is the default gateway for the production network as x.x.x.1/29 on G0/0/1
 The WAN is connected via G0/0/0
 there is a firewall between the production network at x.x.x.2/29
 The ISR1111 happens to also have 8 switch ports off to the side at G0/1/x
 I have a test firewall plugged into the ISR at G0/1/0 with x.x.x.3/29 & GW: x.x.x.1
 I've seen mention of creating a vlan & SVI and ip add x.x.x.4/29, then assigning G0/1/0 to access that vlan
 But would that get traffic routing from a public IP? or would this method only work if the VLAN was a private address and NAT was enabled?
 Are we just missing an ip route from x.x.x.4 to x.x.x.2?
 Unfortunately my layer 3/routing knowledge is lackluster and I feel I'm beating my head against a wall on this one.
 There's a support ticket in with the ISP to config their equipment, but I'm trying to understand what would be needed in this scenario and, I don't have access to an ISR image to lab it.
 EDIT: I should add, I haven't found a router image in my lab that has a layer 2 only add-in card

 Where I'm confused is, I thought DKIM was a protection for spoofing.

 We are struggling to decide the best course of action for 900+ users. I believe we will not be using FIDO2 at this time so our only options are Enroll on Behalf Of for every single user and manually map the cert to their ADuser or send the Yubikeys out and have the users use Self Enrollment. Also we would like these to autorenew every 1-2 years (still deciding on timeframe) but I haven't come across a way for the cert to renew and get updated on the Yubikey itself, only a way for the user themselves to renew and put on the Yubikey.
 Trying to get ideas from people that currently use Yubikey and determine the best route forward.

 Currently the campus has a pair of HA Palo Alto’s. They lead down to two cores which are Nexus 7706s. The two cores feed roughly 40 building totaling to 118 closets.
 The cores are in VDCs. One VDC on each core is for the buildings described above (call it the staff vdc). This VDC has L3 connectivity to the other VDC for the data center. 
 A majority of L3 default gateways live at the distribution layer for the staff vdc and most L3 gateways for DC vlans live in the data center core.
 The team is being tasked with segmenting traffic.
 Would you all migrate L3 gateways to the PANs to zone them or would you VRF and leave the L3s where they are? The vrfs could match zone names going forward What’s the industry standard for this ? Is there another option i’m totally missing?
 Thoughts and opinions appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting ready to place the bid on my second networking job that I will be doing in an RV park.
 The park has about 70 available slots for RVs/campers. Each location has an outdoor weather protected power outlet that I could use for a POE. 
 Several of the RV locations also have existing coax and conduit all ran to one central location that I can utilize as a hub for a switch and place access points in several locations.
 However I also noticed that some of the coax was ran to the point of service for our ISP near a pole and would not be able to be utilized as I believe the drop belongs to them ( we work for the most of thel isps).
 I'm looking for a recommendation on some ubiquity equipment that could be both hardwired and wirelessly bridged for setting up one large or several small mesh networks.
 I'll also take any advice anyone else has here on formats of asking questions for my post or any job tips.
 I'm sure I could wear my way through it on my own but I would love to hear from somebody who's done more than one.
 Most of the networking experience I do have has been just simply running CAT5 and commercial buildings and setting up a simple switch, point to point radios and serval years trouble shooting internet, phone lines and simple wifi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone reading had any experience with using either netbox or nautobot as a source of truth to feed into an automation orchestration system like Ansible specifically for standing up EVPN VXLAN symmetric IRB fabric data centers? There are a lot of unique data point relationships that the data models don't handle out of the box. There are some free plugins, but nothing substantial without doing some significant customization it seems. For example, with a pool of VLANs which fabric VRF are each of the VLANs present in? Or which vlan is used for the IBGP peering within a fabric VRF? Which loopback is the SNAT interface for that VRF? These relationships can be made in static VAR files, but we're trying not to do that and use a dynamic source for inventory and variables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I posted here recently about issues we are having where AD users are getting locked out by the Exchange Server. Things have evolved a little and I am certain the lockouts are coming from Exchange, but I have looked through every Exchange/IIS log I can find and I am unable to find corresponding attempts to access these users' mailboxes. 
 I finally enlisted Microsoft Support after reaching my wits end with this issue and dropped the $500 on a ticket. After a day and a half of intermittently working with them to investigate the issue, they came to the conclusion that...the Exchange server was the source of the lockouts...
 They admitted that I knew that when I submitted the ticket, so they told me they were going to refund the cost of the ticket, but we need to reach out to premier support for a RCA (root cause analysis) as they had reached their limitations in assisting us (they didn't even get as far along as I did in my own investigating...). 
 So I reached out to premier support. Where I'm told you need a premier support contract to get support from them. That contract, I am told, starts at $53,000. $53,000 is what it would cost us to get support from Microsoft, on a Microsoft product, that we already pay heavily for for the "privilege" of using...
 Does this align with anybody else's experience? Are there any other options for us that don't involve spending $53,000? This just seems absolutely insane to me how useless they are in supporting their products!

Company is providing the devices because this person is important enough that we need them to be reachable and have access to company data. Because these are manager types we haven't really put any restrictions on the phones, the MDM/DEP at this point is just so we can remote wipe or recover PIN after someone is let go. We push one or two LoB apps but they can install whatever apps they want. A few have a separate personal phone but most use the company phone as their only phone, which means all sorts of random apps installed. It's interesting to me to see what kinds of apps people have so I look occasionally. Turns out 27 of them have TikTok. 
 So, to block or not to block. That is the question....
 We're in manufacturing and don't really have any particularly special IP if that makes a difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to see if anyone has ever seen similar issues before. A few weeks ago, we started noticing random switchports on the network in various locations in many different L2 domains learning hundreds of mac address on access ports. My initial thought was obviously some time of switching loop. Fast forward a few days, we start seeing the same behavior on multiple (50-100) ports throughout the network. The only commonality between these ports are that they all have a USB-C style docking station attached to them with a laptop. Port-security is helping stop the mac-addresses from overloading, but I'm curious if anyone has ever ran into something like this? We have tried updating the drivers on the docking station with no avail. Some ports are learning almost a mac-address/second. The mac-addresses seem to be totally random as well. When looking up the OUI, many come back with nothing. Any help would be appreciated.

So we currently have a guy who holds numerous hats in our IT department (sys admin, network admin, security admin and more) my thing is he is trying to gate keep a lot of roles and does not want anyone else (new sys admin, and service desk guys) to have access to certain things like AD, servers, network monitoring tools etc. He’s been here longer than our manager so I believe he makes alot of his own decisions based off his ease of use and comfort which imo should not be the case especially if he is implementing security processes. I feel there would be a lack of true security if it is mainly just benefiting him rather than the company. With that being said I believe we should hire a IT security guy to audit/ work with us but work on a different team. I thought this would be a standard thing but it seems like it’s not am I wrong for thinking this way? Should there not be a IT security guy.

 I currently work IT at a small / local bank with main building and a single remote branch in the same town. We connect to our primary financial vendor internal networks via an MPLS router at the main building (there's also a secondary VPN router for fail-over and we're routing certain traffic to a virtual IP but MPLS is the primary route) - just referring to it as the "FI gateway". Then, there are static routes set up in our firewall which route traffic for certain IP's and networks used by bank apps through that FI gateway.
 For the remote branch building, it is connected to the main branch via site-to-site VPN tunnel and the bank apps used there have their traffic routed back to the …]]></summary>

I'm asking because I'm just curious that's all. We have a 9800wlc which is just buggy as hell and has been a nightmare so far as we've had issues with phones not been able to connect to the Cisco aironet aps and just general wifi issues.
 It's not like we will replace the wlc as we just replaced our old 5508 with this 9800 but yeah just thinking of a scenario where if we would replace it with Aruba stuff then how would it mesh with the Cisco stuff.
 And I asked about Aruba because I know that Aruba aps and wlcs are better than their Cisco equivalents.
 Thank you.

I know people hate seeing we are like family here in a listing. Also, I know government IT doesn't fit the fast paced environment cliche but those jobs seem hard to come by. How about competitive salary? Imagine a listing where it says we offer a non competitive salary?

They aren't very tech savvy so If i ask "What's not working or loading?" the response is always something along the lines of everything. They can't tell me if it's a windows issue or an issue with the browser or website they are trying to use, but granted in some cases I do come to a users machine that take forever to even click the windows start bar or launch an application. I was looking at task manager on one the other day and the CPU and RAM were clocked out from either two tabs of chrome or applications that shouldn't be running. 
 I know this is a common thing when it comes to IT work, but I just wanted to get some advice on what I could do to at least make them think the computer is speeding up or actually help that one employee who is actually having the issues. I'm quite new to IT work especially being the only Tech so I guess an Admin. Any advice or tools that I could utizilize would be greatly appreaciated. 
 I already run ccleaner and Malwarebytes and then uninstall any programs that shouldn't be there, even though we have endpoint running on all our pc's for viruses but it doesn't cause issues unless an update or scan is being performed. 
 Thanks for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, does the notes I've made below (along with the one question too) sound about right when describing active vs passive authentication? Let's assume the firewall I mentioned to is a Firepower device too (not that it would matter anyway)
 Active authentication actively prompts the user to sign in before they try and access a website and then after that it will go through the access policy to see if that user account matches any rules for that username for them to be able to access a particular website. You can specify what managed device (computer/vm) you want the user to see this authentication prompt on when they try and access the internet. When it says authentication method is HTTP basic, what does that mean? Does it mean that the device (firewall) will open a port 80 connection with the domain controller to check to see if the users entreded creds are correct and then authenticate the user? 
 Passive authentication won't prompt the user when they're on a device and will instead check ISE (which is acting as the user agent) to tell ISE to go and check AD for the ip to user and group mappings for the account that is presented to ISE and then retrieves that info from the DC's and builds the connection logs out also uses that information to then go through the access policies and check to see if any rules are hit too 
 These 2 authentication methods only work with 80/443 traffic

 I feel like the whole intune interface is like those phones for kids, there’s buttons and options but none do anything because Microsoft knows best.
 Get intune they said…it’ll be fun they said.
 Update: While most comments point to a missconfiguration, which I truly believed as well for a while, I'm still scratching my head as to why this happened in the past couple of days.
 Even so, I can understand that we missed something, but that begs the question, why would this be buried in some obscure settings.
 We have one policy in "Update rings for Windows 10 and later" with an Update Ring Settings "Upgrade Windows 10 devices to Latest Windows 11 release" clearly set to "No" and clearly correctly applying to all corporate devices. This has worked great since Windows 11 released 1 year ago almost, yet today, out of the F*IN blue, without anyone editing anything have I mentioned that?
 Note to self, do not post anything without fully accepting blame, in writing, even if flared as rant.

 Hey, I just wanted to thank everyone for their amazing advice on my last post. Your expertise and kind words helped me take action and improve my situation. Some of you even reached out to me in private to help me out with writing a CV, Configuring the network, fixing the VMware issues and so on, so i feel like i owe you guys an update. 
 I compiled all the evidence I had of rude and stressful interactions with users and wrote out my account of the situation from memory. Then, I printed everything out and went to speak with my workplace leadership. I was acutally shaking so much you could hear the paper move LMAO, but I explained in detail how a certain boss treated me, including how he asked me to break the law to get something he wanted (I had email evidence), and how much it stressed me out when he would be angry that i didn't follow through. I also explained how this workload was too much for one person to carry, and the person I spoke with took me seriously, and I was put on sick leave with pay until I can see a doctor. They're launching an investigation into that boss starting from the very top, and addressing the rotten workplace culture in a discrete manner.
 I have a doctor's appointment on Monday, and I'll most likely get a mental health sick note to take some time off. As for the job interview I mentioned, it didn't work out because I didn't have some Office 365 Certs :D but at least I have time now to look for something better! Also, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW ULTRA CORPORATE THAT PLACE WAS, It almot felt like a cult where everyone was one "giant happy family"! 
 Once again, thank you all for your support and advice. I truly appreciate it and feel like I've played my cards right to improve my situation.

 everything worked perfectly fine and I can see all the data in the new installation, however, noticed that the main search function (all the way top)no longer works for the items that got migrated to the new system, I can manually go to the site/devices and see those. but not using the search option.
 but if I add new items to the netbox, only for those items, the search functionality works as expected.
 For example, suppose I had 10.100.1.1 in the old db, and I added 10.100.1.2 to netbox. 
 When I search with 10.100. in the top search bar, it will now show only 10.100.1.2 which was added newly, not the migrated data.
 Did anyone know how to fix this?
 how to reproduce the issue?
  
Deploy netbox following the official doc in new env.
 dump the database on the old netbox machine.
 migrate the database following the article.
 And search for the items in the migrated db.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, change in management has led to a change in ideology for naming endpoint computers.
 I prefer to just use the device serial number (usually a Dell TAG so 7 characters). new boss wants [unit]-[initial][surname] (e.g. COY-KSmith) type host names. FWIW we had 3 Kevin Smiths at one point. 
 I prefer the abstracted and unique option, mostly for simplicity as the name is printed on the device by the manufacturer. He prefers the generated name so it's easy to guess what a user's computer is called. 
 We are using SCCM so I feel it's easy enough to get to the host via the username, plus I see no benefit with adding a manual tier to this process that will need maintenance if a laptop is reassigned, or replaced. 
 I'm interested to know what does the community think about this? not so much a what do you do questions, we all have our systems that we just do because we've always done it this way, but if you think about it as a green field exercise, what seems reasonable? My issue is I can see his point, and there are some merits to it, but not enough IMO.

 ​
 We have 2016 AD DS environment.

 - 2012R2 AD CS machine
 ​
 We have been doing some hardening work on AD CS machine. We had a company do a vulnerability assessment on our network and they found an issue on one of our servers.
 ​
 My question is : Has anyone had any problems after changing this hardening?
 thanks,

 Right now, we don't have any strategy for testing the updates. I just approve them in a regular basis. (I have automatic approval for Defender definitions and Edge updates.)
 Although I know that's NOT the best option, I don't really know how can I manage the updates.
 I think I'd need a test group of clients for receiving the updates first. Then, after a period of time, I'd approve these updates to all production clients.
 By clients, I mean servers and desktops/laptops.
 I'd like to know from you, what would be the best options/practices to manage WSUS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a series of comments (that I can’t find with Search) discussing whether RAID alone can be considered HA. Some said Yes by confining the scope of the analysis to the drives.
 Others pointed out that a single RAID controller or power supply failure would defeat the HA nature of the RAID drives.
 Wikipedia states:
 There are three principles of systems design in reliability engineering which can help achieve high availability.
 Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding or building redundancy into the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system. Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure. Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover. Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure – but the maintenance activity must. ....
 It strikes me that there is an important distinction between having some redundant components and having no single point of failure.
 I can see that RAID alone has good capacity to improve availability, but I wouldn’t say RAID is HA. What’s your view?
 Edit: good replaces limited

 But first of first, why? What's the deal with Microsoft delaying this key security upgrade? Why are they pushing it back so far? 
 But I guess the delay might be to give organizations enough time to switch over to using number match for Microsoft Authenticator with push notifications. This is a big deal because it adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to confirm their sign-in attempts with an additional secured factor. Plus, the delay will give organizations a chance to properly test and set up their MFA policies, so they won't cause any issues!

 Hello all, Im a little bit confused looking around at the switches there seem to be so many choices!
 I am working on a project at work, i've asked our IT to give me a hand but they are incredibly busy right now so unlikely to have a response from them for a couple of days.
 Ideally i would like to make my purchases today so I could have them from next week.
 I'm trying to run a project that will take a 10GB ethernet cable from a server PC.
 This will need to go to a switch that can output to 20 other connected devices.
 These connected devices dont need to be 10gb, so 1gb is fine.
 I keep on coming across devices that have a 10gb fiber connection. and I see you can get adaptors for these ports but most of them are saying adaptor for "insert switch manufacture", is this a marketing gimmick or is there something that stops them from working with other switch manufacturers?
 ​
 Would some be able to recomend a switch that would work for this?
 ​
 I will need to connect up to 40 devices to this Server but is has a 4 port 10gb switch output so if it makes more economical sense I am happy to get smaller switches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Just wondering if I am missing something. Looking at options to add a GPU to improve performance on our Remote Desktop Session Hosts. Currently all RDSH Servers are VMs Virtualized using Hyper-V as the Hypervisor.
 By the looks of it I need a Enterprise NVidia GPU that is compatible with the Server (Dell PowerEdge R640 for example can support an NVIDIA T4 GPU).
 However reading online, Microsoft have removed vGPU / RemoteFX Support from Windows Server 2016 Build 1084. So this is a no go.
 I think I need the following:
 > An Enterprise Driver License from NVidia
 > A physical GPU installed in a Server, for example the NVIDIA T4
 > A Hypervisor that supports vGPU
 Looking on the NVidia Website, it looks like this is only supported using the following Hypervisors:
 > VMWare vSphere
 > Citrix Hypervisor 8.4
 Both of the above Hypervisors are incredibly expensive in terms of licensing. If I use what I currently have (Hyper-V - Server 2019) this would not allow vGPU or Remote FX, but would only allow physical mapping, so 1 x Physical GPU directly mapped using DDA to the Guest VM RDSH.
 Am I missing something here, how are other enterprises adding Shared vGPUs to their Virtualised RDSH VMs to improve performance? Or is this exactly why VMWare / Citrix are still in business?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I am not a system administrator. I am a developer who handles a few web applications hosted on a DMZ server (or network?). Since they are my web applications, it is my job to ensure the servers stay updated and our wildcard certificates are installed.
 I didn’t really know what to do or how to do it so I kind of just guessed. I had the certificate file and the PFX file (assuming this was the key.) I double-clicked the PFX, put in the password, and it installed. I bound it in IIS with the correct Site and it looked like it worked! Hooray, lol.
 But when I looked into it further I noticed it installed the certificate under the Personal folder. I also noticed there were plenty of other certificate stores/folders in the CertMgr. 
 So my question is, what do these other folders entail? Are they simply just for organization or does each folder hold a different set of policies/security so it truly does matter where the certificate is installed to? 
 I tried Google and it led me to another post in this sub, but it only confused me more lol. Any help would be appreciated or if you can point me in the right direction that would be great!

 So I've been working as a Linux administrator so far (around 2 years) and was offered a position called "IT Application Administrator"
 The IT team member emphasised the word "Application". The role will involve setting up applications on Linux servers e.g. setting up a Web server, configurations, installing the application, some security and testing stuff etc. "Plan-build-run". 
 Ansible will be used for automation. Maybe some shell scripting. I will obviously be using the command line a lot.
 The part that I won't be doing is actually creating the VM/setting up the server and I probably won't be monitoring the infrastructure. 
 Even then, this seems like a Linux role to me? I asked him and he seemed hesitant to call it that.

 I'm currently stuck with the following problem:
 Environment:
 - RDS-Farm (Gateways, Connection Broker, Session Hosts - all W2019 Servers)
 - the RDP-Connection is triggered via the RDP-File downloaded from RDWeb-Page
 ​
 Problem:
 - I start RDP-File in my W11 client, enter the credentials (MFA is also triggered) and the logon works 
 - I start RDP-File #2 (different Username) and the Username from the first connection is the default value. I change to "user different account", enter the second credentials but the MFA is still triggered with the account of the first session.
 ​
 Ho do i get W11 to ALWAYS use the provided username/password? It seems, that there's some kind of cache or something that.
 ​
 I hope the explanation is understandable :-)
 ​
 any tipps would be appreciated. 
 ​
 thx and cheers from austria

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently left a Glassdoor review for a company I interviewed with, but didn't end up getting the job. I wanted to alert other candidates about the red flags I found during the hiring process. However, the company somehow managed to trace the review back to me, and I have no idea how they did it.
 To be honest, I'm not even scared or intimidated that they found out it was me behind the review. I've been job searching since I got laid off, and I don't care about burning bridges at this point. Companies already burn bridges with their bad treatment and terrible hiring processes, treating employees and job candidates as disposable assets.
 The hiring manager even sent me an email to schedule a call with him to clarify some of the points I made in my review and to see if there's a job opportunity for me. But I've been burned by corporate so many times that I have serious trust issues with companies. At this point in my life, I don't believe anything that comes from them, especially if they start dangling carrots in front of me.
 I admit, I'm curious to know how they traced the review back to me, but I'm not willing to risk my privacy to find out. I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Glassdoor reviews being traced back to them. What are your thoughts on this situation? Should I take the call from the hiring manager, or is it not worth my time?
 I'm open to any honest feedback and opinions. Thanks for reading.

 I am trying to understand the differences between the below 2 port configuration. The client conencted to these ports are working fine. Whats the effect of having 'switchport mode access' in the second config?
 What's the best practice while creating interfaces? Do i need to use 'switchport mode access' for all ports where clients will be connected ex. vlan 20?
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/2
 switchport access vlan 20
 spanning-tree portfast
 --------------------------
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/6
 switchport access vlan 20
 switchport mode access
 spanning-tree portfast

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Evening Everyone,
 I wanted to get the insight of some other people within the system administration field. What I'm looking to better understand is at what point does administration become engineering. Based on my experience the line is thin and dependent on the organization that you work for. The way I've reasoned this out in my head in the past is that administration is mainly monitoring/maintaining while engineering tends to be more focused on the planning/creation/building of infrastructure.
 It appears that a lot of employers tend to blur these lines. Though it could just be skewed perspective based on my experience. I'd like to have some idea of where this line is so that I can better educate and prepare myself when negotiating with my current employer and/or other potential employers.

 Now that the older devices are EOL, we can't get support (security updates, etc) any more so we need to recycle them.
 Any recommendations for how to do this? I see lots of things on the Cisco site about trade ins with purchase but nothing for just recycling.
 If there are any community minded businesses, the group is open to accepting donations of recent model "gently used" (within manufacturer's service life) equipment for the group's student run facility on the Eastern plains of Colorado.

 This week I discovered a "solution" created by a helpful guy that was mostly doing the desired job but he reached our to me for help. This guy made this elaborate python "thing" to do some stuff on excel. I was both impressed and horrified. The "helpful guy" was rather sad that I solved the requirements in three hours with VBA and significantly less lines of code.
 That got me thinking, how do others determine what solution set is best for a given requirement. My team has broad skills. For example I do powershell, VBA, HTML, CSS, Javascript and if I'm really pushed to it, .net. Others are equally diverse but we have a REST guy that consumes APPIs like candy. Got another in Microsoft power platform and on.
 So when we get a request, usually I can look at it and push it to the best solution based on my experience.
 How do others handle that?

 Anyways,
 I've gotta provide an Encryption Domain space for our end of the IPSEC connection. Would this be the address space attached to our 'outside' port 192.168.0.0/28 or the 'inside' port 192.168.2.0/28?
 I've been able to ascertain that the domain would be the address space meant to traverse the tunnel but I haven't found an answer as to which address space I should provide.

When the boxes come back up on the "new hardware", they're running weaker processors with slower memory. (Can't help but notice the price hasn't gone down to reflect this loss of power...) I've destroyed my personal systems and migrated to cheaper shared instances because "whatever", but at work, the new power differences between a few of my Docker Swarm worker nodes is creating imbalance where there was none before.
 Call my a cynic, but is this Akamai's influence bleeding in already? Seems pretty coincidental the big company comes in and suddenly my services are getting their corners cut off in a way that doesn't require them to lower vCPU or memory counts on their plans. Is this happening to anyone else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To not re-type everything. Let's just link these two threads here: Will this upgrade ruin my job?, When do you say it's out of my hands?,
 Last week we had a meeting to discuss the slowness issue of our app. Yes it has gotten considerably worse over the past six months. The three teams involved were county networking team, facility IT, contractor team, App Dev team. It took a meeting that also included all management inside the facility to complain about the app slowness and to get someone inside our facility to fix it. My facility managers arranged everything with the county network team, but I supplied IP addresses and the names of the users who were always complaining about slowness. I also showed the county network IT guys how users get on a fresh PC and how slow the app is. They agreed that there was a problem and worked their magic in the background.
 24 hours later users are experiencing a much better and faster virtual environment. They are thanking me left and right for fixing the issue, but all I did was complain to management every day for the past six months. Is this how it feels to be successful?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working with IOL Cisco devices in a virtual lab and have a collapsed core design. I have 2 core/distribution switches. On core 1 I have configured SVI for each VLAN. I want a second core switch (Core 2) to be able to take/distribute load while acting like a backup switch if Core1 goes down. Each access switch should have a redundant link to both Core1 and Core2. What configuration/technology should I look into to help me accomplish the redundant core switch?
 One option I have looked at include HSRP but that seems to be only for routers and not for SVI interfaces. I have also looked at VSS but I lack the hardware to test this feature.

If you take one of those radios and hit the transmit button next to one of our polycom phones while talking on the phone, it will immediately disconnect the phone call. Has anyone seen this before and/or have any ideas on how to prevent this from happening? We've told them to not use their radios near the phones but in an emergency situation where they're talking to 911 they need to be able to use both at the same time without having to walk away from the phone to use the radio.

 Hoping someone can answer this question for me pretty easily. There are two options for getting a virtual ASA in AWS marketplace. One is listed as BOL and the other is PAYG. My question is if you subscribe to the PAYG model, does that INCLUDE the cicso ASA license in the price or would that have to be a separate purchase like the BOL model? Here is the subscription in question:
 AWS Marketplace: Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Virtual - PAYG with 30-Day Free Trial (amazon.com)
 Spoke with AWS support and the basically said talk to cisco so here I am hoping someone can give me a straight answer on it. Can't seem to get anything concrete and cant talk with cisco support without having a subscription. Any help would be appreciated!

 I see them as solid for SMB infrastructure, but not really enterprise/datacenter ready. 
 We are currently running on proper enterprise gear like Cisco, PaloAlto, Fortinet, etc. 
 What, if any, would be a reason to stick with our known products that perform as expected to something like Cato?

Even this simplest cheapest printer now requires an internet connection otherwise it will stop printing. As the toner runs low it try to connect to its supply services to prompt you to buy new tone at exorbitant prices.
 I keep telling users DO NOT buy HP printers but they are cheap because they make their money on consumables. They are now more trouble than they are worth. I've been installing printers from A4 to A0 LED and laser printers for 25 years and have come to the point that these printers are a waste of time and effort. Users end up paying more for support on these printers than the printers cost and is false economy.

Note that this is an org with 12 staff, and no IT department. The single server is an Intel NUC, located in a wall mounted rack in the store room.
 I just got the report back, we failed on the following counts: 1. No penetration test done in the past 12 months. 2. Not enforcing 6 week password rotation (for local non admin accounts on their laptops) 3. No raised floors in the server room 4. No biometric security control for the server room 5. No aircon in the server room 6. Not encrypting off site backups 7. Running both windows 10 and windows 11 on the same network
 I now need to write a rebuttal to the auditors for this travesty of an audit.

 Note, i love the organization, and they are not to bland

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We have DBAs dumping Oracle RMAN backups to an NFS target. We need to replicate those backup files to a 2nd site. The storage devices at each site are different, so we need something that can do host-based replication.
 The RMAN backups are fulls each night, and looking for something smart enough to not send a full backup to the second site each time. I was looking at rsynch and it has a block level synch option, would that possibly work? 
 My main concerns are if the full RMAN dumps would trigger rsynch to send a full each time this won't work, but if it's smart enough to only send changed blocks each night this should be workable. The initial full will be the worst in terms of host impact and time, we will seed it locally if possible.
 Are there better tools for this type of host based copy approach? DBAs do not want a formal agent-based backup app, I understand there are better approaches. Dealing with what we have on hand right now and seeking feedback around rsynch or other 3rd party tools.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 Having a strange issue. All of the sudden, iPhone users can't get internet through my AP's, although they can connect to them, while Android users, and all of the Windows laptops are fine. I have a mix of Cisco 1702's, 1602's, and 1261's. Have reloaded AP's, changed patch cords, rebooted switches, cleared DHCP, but nothing works. They can associate just fine, they just get no internet and the phone shows IP addresses "0.0.0.x" (i.e. 0.0.0.120, 0.0.0.55, etc...). Checked GPO, nothing applied that would be preventing Apple devices.
 At this point I have to imagine it's a setting on the devices themselves, but wondering if anyone has ran into anything similar?

 I was hoping some you more seasoned SA's could help me out. We recently were notified that our Information System Security Officers (ISSO) need to have access to the windows logs on a very small network, which consists of, 6 desktops, and 3 servers. Now, I have log forwarding setup to have the logs sent to our File Server. What would be the best way to get the ISSOs access to the logs on that server without giving them admin accounts?

 I'm trying to work on something using the API for Tanium. I see in their doc: Reference: API Gateway examples (tanium.com) that they share an example: "Perform an action operation (mutation.actionPerform)"
 I'm just wondering if anyone has translated this into a curl or powershell script?
 ​
 In the past, I've only worked with the query API, so something similar to:
 $h = blahblah
 { endpoints(filter: {op: CONTAINS, path: "name", value: "' + $h + '"}) { edges { node { id name domainName ipAddress lastLoggedInUser model manufacturer } } } }'
 ​
 I'm also wanting to target the endpoints: [ID!] field instead of platform (In the example). I'm not sure however, to piece together the chain: Get the ID, Pass the ID and Add Tag: XXX.
 ​
 If you have done, or similar examples, let me know please.

 With that said, I’m tasked with replacing our on premise PBX and have evaluated several service providers for this purpose.
 Current contenders include 8x8, RingCentral, GoTo, and Ultatel.
 I’ve been able to find the information I need to make an informed decision on each of those with the exception of Ultatel.
 Does anyone have experience with them? How did it go/ how is it going? Their pricing is very aggressive and solution appears to include all the features we need (our requirements for a phone system are pretty simple compared to most).
 Thanks in advance

 The problem is that the provider assigns me a private IP and I set behind their small pool of public IPs hence no capability of reaching my NCR to watch the cameras.
 The only idea I've had so far is to bring up an L2TP to a third location which has a public IP and bounce my monitoring through there, but looks expensive and complicated.

 I have tried the 0365 reports script, but it only gets random meetings and nothing useful, even if I give it dates.
 My plan would be to:
  
Create alll meetings under a user
 Get all meetings for that user (they are available on Teams admin, power automate desktop might be a possibility to download them?)
 use a slightly modified script that we have to populate out attendance sheets.
  
Essentially, all it need to do is to automate getting the meeting attendance from team admin (I noticed that downloading the attendance register from teams itself sometimes fails, so I want something durable and the reports on Teams admin are simple and to the point) 
 Also, all the meetings are team meetings, so that is another limitation.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings my fellow networkers,
 I've discovered NeDi recently and I tried to set it up in our enterprise environment. I deployed it on a fresh VM with the latest Debian release (v11.6).
 I installed NeDi via the bash(version 2.2.22) I found on the website which works perfectly but I've been stuck on the RADIUS authentication. Problem is: There is not so much documentation about it and the community forum has its registration for new users currently disabled.
 I found this snippet of code in the nedi.conf file:
 # Authentication for GUI users can be set to: # local, sso, pam, radius, ldap or none # Append -pass to specify a password and optional CLI port for device access in Devices-Write (The GUI-username is used, if the User field is left empty) # Add 2nd argument with ldap or radius to assign groups to users which don't exist within NeDi (disabled if empty, minimal access with "usr,") # Be aware that ldap or radius may have problems with passwords containing language specific special characters #guiauth ldap usr,net,dsk,mon,oth, ;guiauth local # Override the Login and Logout URLs (e.g. for your SSO setup) # The defaults will be used if commented # Login URL Logout URL ;authurls User-Profile.php index.php # Set Radiusserver(s) parameters, if selected above # host port secret timeout retries ;radserver localhost 1812 testing123 2 1 
 It looks pretty straight forward but when I setup the "guiauth" variable to "radius" and configure the "host" and "secret" variable and try to connect to the GUI with one of my test users, I get an error 500 from the server saying that it can't handle the request.
 I've looked into my RADIUS server's logs (Cisco ISE) and I don't even see the request hitting the server.
 Am I missing something ? Also, does anyone know how to hash the secret so it doesn't appear in full text in the nedi.conf file ?
 Cheers to anyone that can help me!

I recently moved to Miami and got picked up by a very top shelf corporate company. It's one of the most sought out due to their benefits and I've heard other techs had to apply 17 times to get their jobs so I assumed I would be surrounded by the top of the top. Instead, it's been 4 months and I can confirm I'm surrounded by some of the laziest inept workers I have ever seen. No one wants to work, tickets are constantly needing to be reopened, users always complaining. Some techs even get written up several times a month but have still been with the company for 4 years because "they never fire".
 This is my first venture into Corporate IT for a large company of around 20,000 employees but I already feel like 80% of the IT department are milking checks. Is this the same across the majority of big companies like this? Should I bother staying with them if i spend more time patching up others mistakes rather than learning something new? I will admit that there are definetly career oppurtunies as most people working in IT support here are so bad my manager has considered making me a IT Tech Tier III Lead but my past jobs would have pinned me as Tier 1.5-2 in skill (fake it till you make it lol)

 The tool is installed per-user, and it sets up a couple of file associations and global hotkeys. In principle I could do all of that programmatically within the application, and simply distribute it as a standalone exe. Would an MSI/App-V/MSIX container be preferable to that?

They started having downtime on Friday, December 2nd at 2 AM and by 6 AM on Saturday had revealed that they experienced a security incident. So I immediately switched off onto a CPanel account that I have just to get my email back up and running (it was just one email address). I finally got access to the restore of my PST file. So what I have is the following at this point: 
  
An 86 GB PST file with email from 2018 to December 2nd, 2022.
 Emails form December 3rd through today that I use WHM/Cpanel to host. It's Maildir format if that helps. I use Thunderbird to check it.
  
What I'd like to wind up with is getting onto Office 365 and import the PST file. That should be straightforward. However, how can I take the email from December 3rd until now and get that into Office 365? Perhaps I could setup a separate Outlook account with IMAP that pulls from my CPanel mail account and then just drag the emails from IMAP into my new Office 365 account?
 Or does anyone else have a suggestion on how I could accomplish this?
 Thanks,
 John

We have created a new baseline using the template for Server 2022 and was wondering if that can be used in a GPO to apply to the OU containing servers of various versions? The documentation states it can be used for Server 2022 and lower versions but do I need to apply a new GPO using the template specific to each OS and if so, how is that accomplished?

 Been a reader of this group for a long time and first time posting. Just looking for others that are in a similar situation as I am and how the F&*k you do it.
 A little about my situation: I’m a one-man IT shop. We have three main offices and a few satellite offices all connected through Meraki VPN tunnels. We have just over 400 employees/contractors.
 On-Site I have two Dell SAN’s, one for production and one for on-site backup. Seven ESXi hosts and ~33 Cisco switches. Cisco CUCM VoIP system and ~90 VM’s. A Synology for off-site backup.
 In the two other offices I have Dell R series servers, one for back up and one for production.
 Now down to the “meat and potatoes”. I do it all from on-boarding to off-boarding to keeping all the hosts, VM’s, switches and other hardware updated. I babysit employees/contractors everyday with the stupid things you read on here every day. I work 60-80 hours a week. In 2022 I worked every holiday there was. I used 7 hours of PTO time the whole year. I’m 59 years old and I’m tired. The kind of tired you can’t sleep off. (what is sleep?)
 Management refuses to let me hire someone experienced to help. (they let me hire a 17 y/o intern about a year ago) but he didn’t last.
 I make a little over $100K with a $13K bonus in 2022. There’s a ton more but that’s the gist of it.
 Opinions? Comments? Am I just plain stupid for putting up with this crap?

 I have recently been deploying some new Juniper route reflectors in order to replace some aging Cisco ones in our network. Our route reflector clients are a mixture of various Cisco and Juniper routers which provide both L2 and L3 VPN services.
 When migrating some of the Cisco clients I have come across an issue where the Juniper route reflectors were not reflecting VPLS autodiscover prefixes to the Cisco clients. On further investigation we found that the route reflectors were not advertising the VPLS AD prefixes as the Cisco devices were never sending a RT-constraint NLRI for configured VFIs using BGP autodisover but LDP signalling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've reached a point of frustration on this one because I'm so close I can taste it, but I just can't quite get the last piece, and it's pissing me off.
 Using MECM to upgrade from older versions of Windows 10 to newer ones and we've got machines with Symantec Encryption Desktop (SED) on them.
 The task sequence does the following:
  
Stages SED files needed for whole disk encryption admin account to do its job.
 Copies files from above to admin account's profile
 Enables SED bypass. (pgpwde --add-bypass --disk 0 --count 6 --aa)
 Copies SED reflect drivers to needed folder for use during upgrade
 Create variable OSDSetupAdditionalUpgradeOptions to include the above reflect drivers
 Upgrade to newer version of Windows 10
 Restart computer
 Re-register the SED password filter
 Disable SED bypass (pgpwde --remove-bypass --aa)
 Reboot
 Decrypt SED encrypted drive (pgpwde --decrypt --disk 0 --aa --all)
 Uninstall SED
 The sequence goes on, but the above is the pertinent bits.
  
The issue I'm having is that the "pgpwde --remove-bypass -aa" command is failing after the upgrade.
 The error I'm getting is -11977 Improper Initialization, which I can only find one reference when Googling, which is: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=f100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427&CommunityKey=8deae12f-88a6-4d88-9186-231c4ca171d7&tab=digestviewer#bmf100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427
 Which references Linux.
 The removal of the bypass only fails before a user logs in. Once a user has logged onto the machine, and back off again, then the bypass can be removed.
 So, my thought process is that, perhaps, SED isn't sully started when Windows starts, resulting in a weird state where the commands won't run until SED finishes starting, but I'm not sure SED's underlying mechanics enough to remediate this.
 It's also an older version of SED, like 10.4 or something.

 Our solution was to install Office 2019 with Project 2019 and then the project files from the network shares open normally in 2~5 seconds.
 Did you expierence something similar with MS Project and network shares? What was your solution?

 They'd like to have an overview what is available, pre-book for visiting clients and obviously for people who are in the office.
 It'd be great if some of you could share your experience in tackling this problem.
 My original approach would be to go with a shared outlook calendar for each parking spot, but maybe there are kickass SaaS tools or even open-source solutions for this problem?
 Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I blocked most if not all file sharing websites such as Onedrive, Google Drive and and so on to avoid receiving ransomwares (we used to receive random "hey, here's the file you requested" spoofing mails with a malicious link on onedrive mainly) so people have to ask me before they can access any link, unless it's a trusted source such as the client's own sharepoint. 
 The obvious problem is that I have to weekly authorize some websites because our clients use them some times. Everytime, I connect to our fortigate and change the web filtering exceptions.
 My question is : what is your approach regarding this, and is there a more streamlined way to do this ? Do you think it makes sense to block all sharing websites (we have our own hosted solution for sharing things, but some clients use their own and sometimes we simply cannot ask to reupload something they just sent us) ?
 I'm running on Fortigate and I don't know any internal tool that can do that, but maybe I'm wrong ? 
 I wish there was some sort of Outlook addin with fortinet where I can select a link and authorize it for a short period without having to connect to the FW directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our organization is currently using a local Active Directory (AD) to manage user identities and resources, but we're interested in exploring a hybrid Azure AD solution. We want to take advantage of the benefits of cloud-based identity management while still maintaining our on-premises infrastructure. However, we're new to Azure AD and aren't sure where to start. 
 What are some best practices or tips for upgrading a local AD to a hybrid Azure AD environment? And what challenges should we be prepared for during the transition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being on site, an half hour ago, I've remotely updated the Windows OS of my jumpbox that is upstair in my server room. 
 Restarted the machine and it disappear from the network.
 No ping answer, no nslook resolution, no remote wake up answer. Times goes on... Nothing...
 My mind instantly start to think to corrupted Active Directory, corrupted DNS, DHCP problems, duplicated hostname or SID or ip with consequent network disruption ...
 ... things that are not really happening in my network since 20 years...
 I run to the server room and saw the PC looks turned on. So I turned on the monitor just to see a veeam recovery menu showing on the monitor. Then I noticed an usb key plugged in.
 I've plugged that key a couple of days before for burning a Linux ISO on it and I have completely forgotten it because I was called for another task.
 So, removing the usb and restarting the system solved all the problems.
 ​
 The fact is that everytime something happens I start thinking to the worst nightmare. And I think that's not really healthy for me. Or for troubleshooting things.
 ​
 I think also that this mindset is a consequence of this work. If you experienced something like that in the past you know what I'm talking about. You cannot forget.
 ​
 But I think this is totally unealthy and an insane mindset.
 ​
 Perhaps it is part of a impostor syndrome cause you know, this world is so big, for a One Man Show that must know everything (in no time).
 ​
 In any case, just to say, is it just me or also you have this insane way of thinking?

which clients supports DoT and which not (the ones you know like Windows, cisco devices, linux servers)
 For now both Standart DNS and DoT should be available, because disabling standart DNS may cause some clients fail to query?
 when client supports DoT, it acts like 1) check if DoT/DoH supported use them otherwise use standart UDP DNS? or how clients knows which protocol to use for communication

 ​
 In the next 2 weeks I have my final exam and I thought about building a Hyper-V-Cluster (2 Servers) with one SAN as the storage. Now the storage makes some problems and I was thinking I just take another server and build up a iSCSI-Storage-Target with the 2 Hyper-V Servers as Initiators, sadly this also won't work because that isn't the purpose of iSCSI... (just one iSCSI-Initiator possible)
 ​
 Is there like a workaround? I was thinking about building 2 iSCSI LUN's and synchronise those somehow, is this possible?

 I'm interested in knowing your overall satisfaction with Fortinet SD-WAN. What are the things you like about it? Are there any areas that could be improved?
 Looking back on your past experiences, is there anything you would do differently if given the chance?
 In addition, I'm curious to know the architecture you have implemented (FGCP/FGSP) on both Branch and Hub sites, as well as whether you have implemented Internet Breakout and how security was handled ?
 I look forward to your insights, which I'm sure will be invaluable not just to me, but also to others in the networking community. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone had any luck trying to use Clearpass for returning DPSKs to a Ruckus controller?
 It's one of those things that would be relatively easy on a more open platform, but looks impossible on a locked-down appliance like Clearpass.
 Clearpass certainly supports the MAC auth that the Ruckus uses in External DPSK mode. And it has no problem in returning Ruckus VSA 142 that should contain a modified version of each PSK. The problem is in storing the PSKs.
 As per the Ruckus docoumentation for the DPSK format, Clearpass would have to be able to use one of the SHA1 key derivation functions and then store a byte array based on a combination of the SSID and the PSK. Let's assume the PSK is admin-assigned, not generated for each client by Clearpass. The natural place to store a DPSK would be a custom dictionary attribute in the Endpoints repository, however, these do not support byte arrays, nor do they provide any access to basic functions. In this case the required function is definitely available to the underlying system as Clearpass uses it for hashing admin user passwords. In any case since the DPSK format is zero-padded a string field cannot be used instead.
 Anyway, I figured it worth asking if anyone had found a solution.

 Was hoping someone may know this. I am busy writing some scripts in Python, one in particular is to SNMP into a switch and basically gather ARP tables as I need to Mac Address and IP Address to run NMAP scans. 
 I did a SNMP walk of a switch just to see the information it has. I came across fields that I want to extract which is easy. So my question is:
 1) I cannot seem to find how to corrolate the port number to the mac address/IP address of the device. I was hoping someone may know? I tried doing Ctrl + F on ifIndex, IP, Mac Address and VLAN but couldn't find the corrolation.
 2) Which OID should I use if I run this across chassis based switches aswell? Which will be most reliable to use? - ipNetToMediaIfIndex, ipNetToMediaPhysAddress, ipNetToMediaNetAddress or ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress?
 SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: DUMMY-SWITCH-NAME
 IF-MIB::ifName.1001 = STRING: 1/1/1

 You may look above and say "Well who uses Alcatel Lucent", I say "Dont worry, I ask myself the same question every day".
 Also mac address above is random, so dont worry! I aim to run this across core switches or who knows, I could even run this across the odd 400 switches we have depending. 
 Hope it makes sense. Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently setup a new network and firewall configuration and one of the major changes we made was to restrict outgoing traffic to specific ports. Tonight I noticed a number of firewall entries that I have not noticed before and I was wondering if the basic logging would give any indication as to what might be happening here. The firewall itself is a cisco asa 5506, I will be looking at ways to capture the traffic in these conditions, but thought I would ask here as well. 
 The server in question does have an incoming ACL on port 443, it also has an outgoing ACL on port 443. 
 The log entry is this; 
 Feb 21 22:59:06 GMT/BST: %ASA-session-3-106100: access-list RS-DMZ_access_in denied tcp RS-DMZ/192.168.51.11(443) -> outside/x.x.x.x(57492) hit-cnt 1 first hit [0xdc286a6b, 0x00000000]
 ​
 The interesting thing to me is that is originating from port 443 and going to a random port externally. 
 Could this be some kind of http keepalive or poll? 
 We have had no reports from the operations team as to things not working, so I can only guess the impact of the block is nothing worth worrying about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to migrate an ASA-5506X from FMC to FDM for device management. After reading documentation and cisco community articles, this process seems easy and requires no downtime, reboot, or configuration loss.
 Documentation shows that the following lines need to be entered on the box :
 **entered after device has been removed from FMC**
 # configure manager delete
 # configure manager local
 This process seems very straightforward; however, this firewall is remote to me, so I wanted to see if anyone has had the same experience running the same migration before I migrate this device myself.Thanks again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in education (high school), and I am planning to pitch a somewhat more stern approach to certain IT practices to senior management soon; in particular, I would like everyone to start using a password manager that is freely provided on every school device, to eliminate things like constant password forgetting for our various services, passwords written on post-its stuck on monitors, etc.
 I am wondering what kinds of sanctions, if any, your companies apply to 'offenders', especially serial ones, who do not follow company policy even after training has been given.
 For example, if employees have agreed as part of an AUP to use the password manager to store their passwords, but you still catch post-its lying around or they still come to you with "I forgot my password", and when you challenge it you get "oh no I am not using that password manager thing"... are there any kinds of sanctions? Disciplinary mentions on their file? Formal warnings? A stern talking to by someone senior?
 I'd just like to see what's out there, to pitch the right ideas to my senior team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiring managers are biased to choose people closer to their own age, whether it be older OR younger. Are these unique experiences I've had, or is it true for everyone?
 I am definitely on the younger side of this sysadmin thing, in my mid 20s. I do not have as much experience as some of you folks but am definitely qualified for the roles I've been interviewed for and while I'm not the best interviewee in the world, I feel I'm decent enough.
 I'm just starting my third tech/sysadmin role. I've probably had 6 or 7 interviews that have gotten to or near the final stage in this field between all of these roles. For every role I have ended up getting, my direct manager has been quite young for someone in their position, somewhere in their 20s for all of them. These aren't even interviews that I feel I've done particularly well in. In fact, I feel some of them were quite bad, worse than ones I have failed.
 However, I notice the opposite with deciders who are a generation or two older than me. Many of them more than double my age. In these interviews, I have come out feeling like I nailed every question and left no room for questioning, but still find out they have chosen the other candidate or did not choose me for hire. From my personal experiences it just seems so blatant and honestly the largest factor in the interview process. Has anyone else experienced this as an interviewee or interviewer, or have I just had some unlucky experiences?

 But the situation I'm up against is we have a trans woman who doesn't want to see her dead name anymore. I'm trying to accomplish this for her, but I'm up against a few factors that are making it a little irritating to deal with.
 So for example, cached exchange mode. Even after telling it to download the offline address book again, the name doesn't properly update. And Exchange and Teams admin centers, new name shows up when referencing the online GAL, but client-side the old name and new name often show up at the same time depending on which viewport you're opening.
 Am I gonna have to nuke offline OABs and force cache resets?
 And this does seem like a lot of unnecessary effort, but it is a very important and personal issue to her and I'd like to accommodate her wishes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use Chrome Enterprise across the board as our default browser and I've been pretty happy with it and with the GPO controls you can apply to it so far. But I recently read that Chrome is enabling their "memory saver" feature by default. 
 Memory saver discards the content of your background tabs after a "certain amount of time" then reloads the tab when you switch back. This has some potential to cause problems in our environment where people use tabs to go back and forth between sites for data lookup/entry and have text entered but not saved.
 There are ways to manually disable it from the UI, but I have yet to find a GPO rule that will turn it off. I downloaded the newest ADMX templates and skimmed them, but didn't see it listed. 
 Does anyone know a good way to disable this across the board without relying on user interaction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to find the answer to Nexus VPC peer-gateway without HSRP behavior for some time on the internet now to no avail. 
 VPC peer-gateway installs the other switch's mac in the mac table as GATEWAY so there wont be any unnecessary forwarding on the Peer-Link but in all documents it is paired with FHRP. What happens if I set the same IP address (Gateway for downstream server/router) under the SVI on both switches and enable Peer-Gateway without configuring FHRP? Just a duplicate IP address and Peer-Gateway.
 ​
 This is a long story, I'm not a fan of this since you can run HSRP on a private IP range and set a single IP from a public range as gateway for clients under the HSRP virtual IP but for some unknown reason my boss is pushing for the first option and I'm not sure what's going to break under such circumstances.
 ​
 Any input is appreciated I'm hoping to convince the boss to go for the sane method but need some better understanding first and demonstrate what negative effects it can have. Maybe it's going to work flawlessly and I just don't know about it but he is not giving me any reference to back up this solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I'm in the process of setting up the Firewall as the place where routing happens so I can do inter-VLAN inspection. See previous post. I have a Palo alto 450 connected to a Cisco 9200.
 Historically our core has been connected to a firewall via a Layer 3 connection with an IP address. 172.16.0.1(firewall) > 172.16.0.2 (Core). There are static routes on both devices that list those IPs as the next hops. 
 I'm trying to get the VLAN information and routing up to the firewall, and in order to do that I need to make a trunk connection rather than an access connection. But trunk connections don't have layer 3 IP addresses, so if I convert my access connection to trunk, I'll lose my IP addresses. But then my static route won't know where to go. 
 I'm sorry, I feel like I'm missing something very obvious here. How do I do inter-vlan routing on a firewall and still have the core switch know how to get traffic from the access switches up to the firewall?

 Hello everyone, a few months back i was promoted to IT Manager (i started as HelpDesk L1 and then as an IT Analyst; also i work in a hotel).
 The thing is that i really feel like i don't belong yet to this position, since i don't know much about Networking (I know how to configure Switches, Firewalls, Routers, AP but just the basics), Azure or AD (i don't know if it's relevant but i love to use Microsoft Power Automate).
 So any advice or tip you can give me it would be great!
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: Thank you again all of you for your responses, i'm thinking that is not what i really want, i think i would like to be like a Sys Admin or Sys Manager)

 We have switches that have uncovered empty SFP slots (I know, bad, bad, inherited environment) that have been running for several years. I now need to install an SFP module into one of said switches but I am unsure of the safest way to ensure the port is clean. The problem is the switch cannot be turned off, way too important unfortunately. My worry is possible shorts while disturbing any dust during cleaning.
 Initial thought is to use canned air in the slot. Are there any dangers that could arise from using canned air in the slot? Please let me know what you recommend.

 P.S. We are looking into dust caps for the ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like this is rolling out to their servers currently, full changelog here:
 https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u3k-release-notes.html#esxi-7-0u3k-21313628-standard-resolved
 Direct links for anyone who needs them can be found here:
 https://esxi-patches.v-front.de/ESXi-7.0.0.html
 Obviously this only fixes ESXi 7, 8.0 isn't affected and 6.7 is now out of support so if you are still on that you will need to disable secure boot as the only workaround.

I've taken CCNA level courses, and have a decent understanding of basic network theory. Now, I work in higher-ed and I've been here 3 years in a role that focuses more on server deployment and maintenance, vSphere management, and application deployment, NOT in networking. 
 The first week I started (January 2020) I noticed how lackluster and unpredictable the Wi-Fi was on my phone. We have 4 SSIDs, a hidden one, a guest one, a staff one, and a student one. Guest is open, and the hidden SSID is for MDM deployed devices (WPA2-PSK). Staff/Student is 802.1x with user login. They all land on the same VLAN...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in a small-mid business as the IT technician and we outsource some of the upgrades which we have done. One of which is coming up due no longer being able to get support or licences for the Watchguard M200.
 We are having to look at upgrading possibly part of this setup or all of it as part of a refresh due to this and preventative in case of failure of the hardware since its over 6 years old. (before my time). We have no choice but to upgrade the Watchguard m200 since the licensing which we just renewed Jan 2023 (paid for one year) but only can get it till end of June this year.
 We have been quoted by the company which we outsource some of this the Meraki kit from cisco. 
 The MX105 to replace the router/firewall which is currently a Watchguard M200.
 MS120-48FP in place of the two HPE switches and 
 MR44 to replace the ubiquity wifi access points.
 ​
 However from the research I have done, it feels quite overkill. We have about 40-50 employees in the office and 100 others working on phones remotely (which don't need to really connect to the office network). Only users which need to VPN access to the office network is about 10-20 users.
 ​
 I'm Torn between the two options (open to other options), 
  
Replace only the Watchguard M200 with the latest equivalent and upgrade the controller for the AP's to a more reliable one. 
 Follow the recommendation but possibly with a MX75 instead of a MX105.
  
One thing that does confuse me is whether some of the security features are tied to licences (advanced security, enterprise or SD-WAN) or to the devices. Features such as content filtering and web search filtering and intrusion protection. 
 What they quoted us came to about £27,000 for kit and licences for 3 years. I'm quite new to this could use some advice

 They also have a few POE devices (Unifi AP and cameras) and could benefit from a POE switch.
 Thanks in advance.

 Edit: You’re guys are awesome. Thank you so much for all the awesome suggestions. He likes the 48 Unifi POE with the 24 port as a backup. Will be configuring a VLAN for Guest Wi-Fi and one for the security cameras.

 It works after removing site ip from iplisten list and adding it back. Not sure why it stops after a restart. any specific services need to be running ? I checked for iis admin service and .net tcp listener service are in running state. 
 When this issue happen I look for site ip given in IIS manager under site bindings of that url that is not working and I run below commands
 Netsh http delete iplisten ip address 
 And 
 Netsh http add iplisten ip address 
 In 2 or 3 minutes site will be up. But not sure what is causing it not to work after restart. 
 Above steps need to be done repeatedly whenever there is a server restart and we are getting many tickets especially due to this issue.
 Kindly let me know if any links or sources to correct this issue. I am newbie to managing servers and still in learning phase. Appreciate any inputs on this

My understanding, then, is that basically the only way to open a 1Password encrypted vault is to be on a device that has already been authorized and have your user password. 
 So what's to stop an attacker from using a keylogger to get your user password, and then gaining remote control of your device and just logging into it? Is this just a "secure your workstation better, dummy" kinds of situations?

 I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?
 I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was "what are we fixing today". And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. 
 Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking "what is going to break today", and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.
 I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office. I dont think that they will let me go because they do love what i have done, but the anxiety side of me worries that if they dont see me actively doing something, they will think im not doing anything, and given nothing is breaking to fix, im no longer needed.

 I am developing a product for multiple clients, and that product is going to be running on the cloud as a SaaS. The product focuses on analysing the client's private security cameras, so the idea is that the client simply puts the IP of the camera and my product starts picking up the feed. In these situations most of clients have their cameras in a private network and so just by having the IP won't do any good. What would the simplest way for the client to allow my product to have access to that private network so it can access the camera feed ?

 I've got a problem with my dc here. I'm in the process of migrating a ton of VMs to another esxi host that is configured identically to the one it was on before.
 One of these VMs is a domain controller for my little experiments here. All machines get their IP config from a dhcp like this: host { hardware ethernet aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa; fixed-address dc.test }
 this works fine but now after migration I can't reach anything with the DC and vice versa. I see the DC asking for ip-configs on the dhcp-server and it does configure itself with the info obtained, but it stays unreachable. 
 tried this windows tool to troubleshoot it lol, it say the problem is that the gateway is unreachable (no shit sherlock) so as I think everything is configured correctly and should just work like with all the linux VMs i moved, i thought I'd ask here.
 Any ideas whats wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey hey, Does anyone have experience with using external 4G/5G antennas with their routers? I have a use case where a mobile router needs to be placed in a basement, approx. 10-15m away from a place with sufficient mobile signal. Is there an antenna with such cable length that would work? 
 Router/antenna recommendations appreciated.
 I was also thinking about getting a rigid poe-powered 4G router (btw, 5G is not a must) and placing it where the signal is available. The place is a ventilation pipe, so withstanding weather of any season is necessary. Then, I'd only have a PoE switch and an AP in the aforementioned basement.
 I'm in Europe, btw.
 Asking for a friend.

 Looking for advice on delegating device management within an MDM world.
 Context:

We have a spin-off company (Company B) that has its own local IT team and managed about 300 devices. Company B get some services from us, such as the O365 licenses (so they user our @companyname.com email address), they previously got AV from us (see notes below) and they do their own wipe and load using their own SCCM instances that is no way connected to ours's.

 Been hitting me hard lately and putting myself down I guess but boss told me earlier that I can expect a 2k pay rise in the next coming months which all other directors happily and easily agreed to which kind of put it into perspective that I’m probably not doing that bad at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously, our staff users have had a home drive "U:" on one of our file servers. We're currently in the process of migrating these over to OneDrive for Business, but for some staff we're finding that after we've migrated them, they are sometimes not seeing all their other network drives in File Explorer on Windows 10.
 We currently map network drives using logon scripts - Group Policy Preferences would not be practical as different users need different combinations of network drives - these scripts are batch files with commands like net use v: \\SERVERNAME\SHARENAME$ /PERSISTENT:NO.
 For the vast majority of users these are working fine but for some reason, intermittently the network drives don't show up in File Explorer. We tried re-running the logon script but that said the drives were already mapped. We went to try mapping the drives using the Map Network Drive wizard in File Explorer, and we found that the wizard could actually see the network drives. This led us to discover that restarting File Explorer made the drives visible.
 We tried setting the EnableLinkedConnections registry entry (e.g. as per this ServerFault post) but this did not help.
 We tried enabling NETLOGON debug logging on computers where the incidents were reported, but the NETLOGON debug log didn't show any obvious causes.
 Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue and how we can resolve it? Other than having our users restart File Explorer every time their drives go missing?

 Solo IT officer for a medium sized org here. I need some advice on how to handle guest users in our organisation's AzureAD/InTune environment.
 I'm quite concerned about the security implications of how it is setup currently.
 Without getting into too much detail our organisation has clients that walk in off the street and use our computer lab to work on relatively confidential documents.
 Before my time our we had setup several generic user accounts for non employees to use e.g. guestuser1, guestuser2, etc.. for the guest users which is obviously is going to leave behind traces of the files and logins stored within the user profile from the previous session which is not ideal. So I need to come up with a better solution.
 Relying on staff to send new user requests for each new guest and having me to create them and assign them office licenses is just going to be way too cumbersome.
 I need something that will allow guests to login to specific PCs with just access to the web and ms office with minimal intervention from IT.
 Wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat and what they have tried.

 Python scripting (for system administration) - I have no experience (apart from scripting in general (PS))
 Terraform - I have no experience (apart from IaC in general, while using Bicep)
 Linux - yeah, no experience here too...
 Docker/K8 - still nope
  
Which one would you choose as the first step? How deep would you go? Would you go all in into Linux, for example, or just learn the basics and go on to the next one?

 My company has finally made the decision to migrate to Office 365/Exchange Online after YEARS of pushing them to undertake the project. We are currently just finishing up some of the prep work on our Exchange such as moving everything over to AD sync, migrating resource rooms etc before we start doing User Mailboxes.
 One of the questions is what's the best licensing model? We are looking at getting rid of our Anti-Virus and going with Microsoft Defender which comes standard with M365 E3 and M365 E5. My manager has decided to pitch the idea of going with a mixture of Business Standard and Premium with adding on Exchange Online Plan 2 (For some employees), InTune and Microsoft Defender license ON TOP of the business standard and premium.
 Are there any benefits that the M365 E3/E5 provide over the Business Standard and Premium if we add those extra licenses on top or would it just be smarter to go with the M365 E3 and E5?
 The manager has pitched massive cost savings but doesn't really make sense to go with Business Standard/Premium with the add on licenses opposed to just forking out the extra money for M365 E3 and E5?

 We want to use that server as backup storage now, but I'm not sure about the old disks. 
 My gut feeling is to replace them, even if it will cost some money, but I bet they're going to fail soon and I don't want to buy old rusty rotating disks again and replace them one by one.
 Maybe someone has some experience here and / or advice?

 I'm just wondering if this is normal in the day and age of 2023? Personally, I never forget my passwords and I'm quite baffled that, at least the teachers (20+ years old) forget their passwords this often.
 The younger kids may be excused in this case, but grown up people not being able to handle their passwords just strikes me as odd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even your backups should have backups!
 Long story short - My UnRaid VM directory yeeted itself out of existence, took my backups on a hot date and just said F it.
 I went to make some changes on a VM (directly upgrading to Windows 2019 std) and had to reboot in order to accept the changes. The VM went missing - hmm that's odd - No problem! I'll just recover it from an older backup. I have a schedule of 30 days to hold backups, and they're usually overwritten when they reach 15 backups, older ones are deleted afterward.
 Those were deleted too.
 No logs.
 No errors.
 No error logs.
 No system logs.
 No alerts telling me about the missing logs.
 Nothing.
 Just an empty folder from my ~/domains/ - and no VM's in sight. I rebuilt the VM from scratch, and I'm on my merry way now. Not sure what happened - the Vendor is hopefully researching into it as it's some abnormal behavior

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 4 IT jobs I've had (Im a very technical IT middle manager), 3/4 Heads/Directors/CIOs of IT have had absolutely no technical ability whatsoever, they dont even know what Azure or Active Directory is. This applies to both the dev/sysadmin sides of IT.
 I've only had 1 IT head who was technical and had great soft skills, he we an amazing boss, we could discuss technical details at length, and he knew how to carry himself and represent us in C level meetings, he was amazing. 
 Why is it that only IT has this issue? Our CFO knows all about the ins and outs of budgets/cashflow and is very knowledge in his field. Our Head of HR knows all about policies etc. Our C level exec of law is VERY knowledge in law.
 Its not just past jobs either, you wouldnt hire a head of medical surgery that had no idea how to perform any surgery. You wouldnt hire head chef who couldnt cook. Imagine hiring a head of Marketing or Sales who had little to no idea about marketing or sales.
 I'm not saying you need to be hyper technical about IT to be a CIO, but you at least have to be good at it in some capacity in ADDITION to have good soft, management and leadership skills (just like any other C level position). I'm not advocating hiring a technical person who has crap soft skills btw. 
 Is it just that finding someone who is technical and has the above skills is to hard to find in IT? So they just hire non technical people to run IT departments because thats all their is in the talent pool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been checking out the DPVS project as of recently and some of the layer 4 features seem like they could do quite well for implementing a stateful firewall I could control from a database I can interface with. I have a few machines that each have IPs on my subnet for each application I'm running and a distribution layer switch. 
 I want to use Bird for announcing my ASN and advertising my unicast subnet (potentially AnyTun package might be used for applications to have lower latency to Europe in the future) and if possible manage to implement /arouteserver for peering with cloud providers which I access frequently to lower IP transit costs. 
 Since I have no upstream to filter traffic I would be verifying on my own and forwarding to my switch the traffic and letting it manage IPs to destinations to leverage its switching capacity for when my machines will intermingle with each others' applications instead of using up the capacity on my Linux entry and BGP machine. 
 I apologize for my limited networking knowledge when it comes to design and architecture, but I have the feeling that a software based router would be the best in this scenario, if you guys have any advice for DPDK based open source projects I could leverage or implementing a firewall that could handle reasonable PPS with efficiency on a 2x40Gb/s NIC and 7950x consumer high IPC processor I would be grateful and massively appreciative.

 Its been just over a month and I think I need to pull the plug. The last month has had me at the brink of burn out with basically doing both of our jobs and trying to train them as well. I can see things are not sinking in and can out right see them not paying attention during training sessions.
 I feel it would be easier going back to solo and looking for a replacement, but does this all seem too soon, or I'm asking/expecting too much? 
 Expectations were I could assign them switch configuration tasks and they could handle them no problem, as long as proper documentation was provided. It was provided and they seem utterly lost, and I've ended up essentially doing the work.

 AND, the last section is "Upstreams", so is that referring to the ISPs that my ISP is the customer of? 
 e.g the upstream ISPs advertise their routing tables for my ISP so my ISP can route through them. (my ISP obviously has to pay to them right?)

 Our main office currently has a pair of 6807XL's in VSS, someday we'll need to replace them. Seems Cisco bumped the EOL by a few years due to supply chain issues, but the topic of lifecycle came up recently. The long story short is: We're not sure we need a chassis platform for this office, but Cisco obviously wants to upsell us and immediately flipped shit when we brought up the idea of running our "data center" off a stack of 9300X's. 
 I use the term "data center" sparingly since there is no Nexus, fabric, routing protocols, VXLAN, etc. happening. We've got less than a hundred 1G copper and about a dozen 10G fiber ports lit at the moment, a chunk of the copper is MGMT interfaces. …]]></summary>

 I have this cenario:
 vWLC --> core sw --> dist sw --> acess sw --> 12xAP's 1852 --> SSID <-- AP's2852 WGB <-- siemens PLC <-- moving car.
 the siemens PLC is a passive client with a fixed ip, because we use a virtual WLC i can't activate the passive client option, so there is no arp resquest reaching the PLC, so from time to time the arp cache in the switches gets cleaned and lost connectivity. As a workaround, I created a simple pyhton script that goes into WGB and pings the PLC to generate some traffic, but I need a more professional solution. Do you guys have any suggestion to this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These things are driving me nuts. I inherited a shit show. No professional site survey before AP deployment. Have multiple zones, that my predecessor installed where apparently one new AP can do the coverage of two old APs. Laptops and mobile work stations do fine with roaming and connectivity. Using Ascom i63 phones with Ruckus R730s, SmartZone as the controller. Phones are on 5Ghz band. Phones register with the pbx. User complaints are poor roaming and "ghost calls" where the phones will ring to a bridged extension but I assume packets arrive late due to high latency (they rarely go over 50ms on the AP) and the phone rings but caller not on the other end.
 Followed the interrop report from Ruckus/Ascom to set up the WLAN. The client settings and WLAN are exactly like the interop report. Doing wireshark traces does not reveal the problem. Did several Ascom log traces and when I caught the problem, notify Ascom and apparenly we do not have some super duper special docking station which allows me to view the log file. Absolutely livid about that. Getting no real help from Ascom other than they want more Omnipeek traces. 
 I have been concentrating on one zone at a time. I got them to work better in two zones just by moving the APs further away from each other or deleting one or two. I do my own Netspot surveys and do not find coverage to be the issue. I am thinking more that co channel interference is the big issue here however neither company can point out exactly what the issue is. Does anyone have experience with this? It's the no professional site survey isn't it?

 I am seeking ways to enhance the overall security of our SSL VPN by limiting access to only corporate laptops. We have Sophos UTM9 Firewall.
 I am considering the option of utilizing SSL VPN with a Certificate. However, I am uncertain about how to configure it. Currently, we have RADIUS authentication with AD and Duo 2FA.
 Moreover, I am concerned about the possibility of the certificate being exported by end-users, which would enable them to import it into other devices and undermine our efforts to limit access to corporate laptops. 
 Would it be necessary to implement NPS to achieve this? If yes, how can I configure it?
 I am open to considering other quick solutions. 
 Any help or insights on how to accomplish this would be greatly appreciated.

 You know, I used to be up on the Windows server releases. Used to, because I can't remember the last time I deployed an app on Windows. Everything is RHEL now. We even deploy MS SQL Server on Linux these days.
 Has anyone gone all Mac or all Linux on the desktop?

 I work at a small (<15 employees) controls engineering firm. I was originally hired to design SCADA HMI screens and the database backends that collected data. As such as I was really familiar with python (jython 2.5./2.7) which is the scripting language of our SCADA software of choice and SQL. These two topics I am very comfortable with and would rate myself as above-average or better at.
 As time has gone on I have been exposed to certain network concepts just for deployment of our SCADA systems - IP addressing, firewalls, subnets, and working with Active Directories but just as a means of getting a user source for our SCADA projects, however it was all very surface level, and I only ever learned "just enough" to get things working.

 So I am looking to set up a network for an industrial application. I will do my best to explain the intended architecture, but fee offer suggestions on this point as well. Starting off, there will be a layer 3 switch capable of inter-VLAN routing. I plan to assign a specific VLAN ID and IP Address to each port. Connected to each port will be a machine consisting of 3-4 lightly managed switches (addresses in the same subnet as the VLAN with the VLANs IP Address as the gateway). Connected to the lightly managed switches will be 40-60 Ethernet/IP devices, including a PLC and, on some machines, a PC.…]]></summary>

 After nearly 20 years of doing this, and recently starting a new role at a new company, I made a rookie mistake by misreading/interpreting a report, and thus making a change that essentially affected nearly 3,000 users in a negative way. I'm probably beating myself up more than I think my superiors are, or will. Regardless, I feel like crap about it, feel like a failure, and need to get out of my own head to move forward.
 This is going to be a long week.
 Edit: Wow, this blew up more than I expected it to. No possible way I can respond to everyone, so I just wanted to say... Thanks! As per usual, you guys are awesome! Good news is since I no longer work in a toxic work environment, I bounced back way quicker than I ever expected to. Was back on track (physically, emotionally, and mentally) pretty much by lunchtime. Issue was resolved and just trucking forward on the next item!

 With that being said, I wanted to ask anyone who has experience with using Microsoft 365 accounts to sign into Windows, does it work well? It seems like it would give the same benefits that a roaming profile would, but I don't have enough experience with it to start rolling it out confidently. Any issues that you ran into when using the Microsoft 365 account over a domain account? Any benefits that stood out after the fact? Any advice would be appreciated!

I have my concerns - if someone hacks a personal email account that puts the internal recipients at risk of receiving a malicious email, and I've expressed these concerns. They still want me to find a way. 
 If I do move forward with it - is there a overall setting that will allow personal emails to come through? Or do I need to mark each sender as safe, as they come in. Maybe the second approach is safest. What available options do I have?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello altogether,
 I'd like to tell you something about task on going and I am stuck therefore I am searching for new creative ideas in this topic.
 --
 Background story: We currently use Office 2016 for Blue collar workers where they use shared-devices in order to edit documents, review or save them. Basically what a white collar does just with a M365 E3 License. However Microsoft has announced that Office 2016 and below is ending support for M365 Connectivity services - that's where the problem begins.
 Cause: Microsoft announced that Office 2016 will be dismissed with supporting connections to M365-Services like SharePoint and OneDrive. (See: Office versions and connectivity to Microsoft 365 services - Deploy Office | Microsoft Learn )
 Issue: Solution would be easy to convert everybody to M365 licenses but with almost 7500 BCs it will be way too expensive and cannot justified against management to have such an rise of expenses for licensing.
 Idea: Then I though, hey let's enable Viewer Mode for M365 products such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They can view but cannot edit them. If they need to edit documents they can use Word Online and we are going to assign them M365 F3. 
 But there is the next issue which comes with it:
 They cannot access any network shared files where all the local files are located today. Then they need to manually open OneDrive for Business and Word Online everytime and upload the files which they wanna use, save, download and upload it to the network sahre. This won't work since conflict risk is pretty high at that amount of users.
 This is not a great solution and I am out of ideas since Microsoft does not provide any further information. Before I create a ticket at Microsoft I'd like to ask the community whether you have any ideas and if you may experience the same issue in your company?
 Thanks in advance!

Our change management team have apparently renamed themselves "CMaaS" - Change Management as a Service. They have a very nice wiki and a lot of written processes, but none of these team members are scalable virtual machine clusters, as far as I'm aware. Seems sooo weird (at best) to appropriate a defined, if buzzwordy, naming convention. We have a number of weird "aaS" named services which are in now way fitting that model, but now we can apply it to actual people? Way to devalue a concept, right?

 The problem is, we can only buy software on account, but systracer is not available with this payment option.
 I am aware of Regshot (advanced), but it can only track registry changes, not filesystem changes. Also compare multiple steps is not really possible.
 ​
 I would be thankful for any recommendations for alternatives (either for file system changes or registry changes, but in best case something that can do both)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had no idea where to ask this so apologies in advance if I'm in the wrong place and if I get the terminology wrong (I almost definitely will)
 Long story short: I have been stalked by someone for years and no matter how many times I make sure my accounts are secured with two factor etc, they always seem to know the most specific information about me. Where I bought dresses I wear in Facebook photos, where I've booked a dinner reservation etc. In addition to this, I keep being subscribed to newsletters I don't remember signing up to. A lot of these required confirmation and the confirmation emails are nowhere to be seen in my inbox 
 Other than a public profile picture, all of my socials are incredibly secure and have been for some time due to the ongoing nature of this behaviour. 
 I thought maybe my emails were being forwarded but I've found no evidence of this (I use gmail and have multiple accounts). Tonight I was having another look around my gmail settings and I saw that my IMAP is turned on. I dont understand IMAP or POP but my understanding is, IMAP allows my gmail to be synced with a different mailbox and all changes (including deletions) are synced. 
 I'm of the belief this is how my stalker is doing it, but as this is an ongoing investigation with the police (there is a court order in place). I want to get any sort of IP information before I just switch it off. 
 Is there a way to do this? Am I understanding all of this correctly? Do any of you have any other ideas? It's been going on for so long and most police I talk to are tech illiterate haha.
 Apologies for the long post and thank you in advance

It worked as advertised, however the new photos are not automatically displayed in Sharepoint.

 Is there any way to do this from the admin side, without requiring every single user to view his own profile? I know MS says there isn't but maybe someone came up with a creative solution.

The following types of customized settings will be overwritten when you install an Exchange CU: 
 Any customized Exchange or Internet Information Server (IIS) settings that you made in Exchange XML application configuration files on the Exchange server. For example, web.config files or the EdgeTransport.exe.config file. 
 Customizations to the operating system's TLS/Cipher settings. 
 Be sure save this information so you can easily re-apply the settings after the install. After you install the Exchange CU, you need to re-configure these settings.
  
Does anyone have or know of a script that can check for and back up all of the possible customizations that could be overwritten by an Exchange CU? Ideally only backing them up if they are changed from the default.

 One person just gets ahead and writes about the existing problem to my facebook messenger... Like what the heck? Why would you do that? If you have some mobile internet then why not write to our HelpDesk? Or at least e-mail or the messenger we use in work? Why would you write to a messenger I never use for work and is only personal? I mean I will probably just block that person over there. Or at least ignore.
 I'm sorry for this rant but I really don't get some people. Why do they want to bother us so much?
 Do you guys have similar experiences? How do you deal with it?

Then a new tech gets reassigned and same issue. I've seen some posts online requesting help from Microsoft, and same someone always comes asking for logs, and then nothing is ever heard again.
 Is this a common experience with them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know we all hate those little yellow Post-It notes with passwords, but…
 So this week my childhood best friend’s brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. He was barely fifty. The family had no idea where to start. They didn’t know if he had a will and, if so, who might be the executor. They didn’t know his financial relationships. They didn’t know his insurance policies. They didn’t know who his lawyer was. He was somewhat secretive, and they were stumped.
 What they did have was a stack of four laptops, ranging from his current laptop to plan older one circa 2004. They brought them to me to see if I could “hack” into them and glean anything that might point them in the right direction. I promised I would do what I could.
 I started with the only one that had a power adapter. I was lucky enough that the default account, “user”, had no password and had admin rights. I logged in, reset the password for his account, and started hunting. I found a few work-related documents and some photos of his kids and not much else.
 Next, I gathered all the old laptop chargers I had around and tried to fit the laptops. No luck. Where is my universal charger? ugh. Anyway, I opened one of the laptops and what comes fluttering out? A single Post-It Note. I though, “Please let this be a password”. We all know that is the main use of these damn yellow sticky papers, right? Well it wasn’t, but it was just as good. It was a list of names and phone numbers. Lawyer. Banker. Investment advisor. Insurance agent. Mortgage broker. The works.
 Anyway, thank God for little yellow notes, but I still need to get into the laptops. Anyone have any recommendations for boot sticks that might permit resetting SAM accounts, mounting file systems, etc? I used to use Trinity Rescue Kit, but that was half a career ago. I am also hoping nothing is encrypted; wish me luck.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Quick question, hopefully someone can assist, this is the first time I have properly configured STP rather than set the defaults and run, and I am not 100% sure if I should even have it enabled over the MC-LAG links for the Juniper Top of Rack or leaf switch stack.
 The link below is an example of the network layout I am configuring.
 https://imgur.com/a/B5bAy5J
 Should I disable RSTP and VSTP on the Juniper, on the MC-LAG interface to the core switch? Currently it is set up with RSTP, the MC-LAG interfaces are set to point to point and other interfaces are edge, the ICL between the stack has RSTP disabled, and it's set block BPDU on edge.
 The Cisco portion of the network has Rapid-PVST+, the core is the root bridge, the others are default, access ports are portfast, etc. basic Cisco set up really.
 I am not sure if I should disable all STP on the MC-LAG interfaces to the core and management switch, the MC-LAG stack is an aggregate switch stack, should it just pass through the BPDU packets? I believe this is what the Juniper documentation is getting at but it's a little wishy washy on that. This would basically leave Cisco to run STP on its network, and just leave the rack alone. Or do I pass through the packets and enable Rapid-PVST+ on the management switch, on the other side of the Juniper MC-LAG?
 Or should I also be setting up the Juniper MC-LAG stack to be handling the incoming BPDU packets from the Cisco? I would have to add PVST to it as well for interoperability, I am just not sure how this may affect the RSTP running locally, which was recommended to be enabled by Junipers docs.
 Any help would be much appreciated.

 But I can't simply re-use the original SAS cables: connectors are different and card are in different PCI slot (so length is not the same).
 Here are some pictures:
 Pictures 1 and 2: SAS sockets on the backplane:

 I’m in my early 30’s and 6 months ago became the lone IT guy in a medium sized business (~200 devices). I currently work with an MSP who has dropped the ball quite a few times and has long lead times. I personally feel they can’t adequately support the user base in a timely fashion. 
 Currently, I’m not unhappy with the job, but I find myself a bit bored after I got myself up to speed on the infrastructure and the security improvements that needed to be made. My job also shifts rapidly from providing level 1-3 tech support along with sys admin tasks. I find myself wanting co-workers to bounce ideas off of, but I don’t have that outlet here. I’m getting the itch to move onto something else, but I’m not sure where I want to land and how to get there. I like the sysadmin side of things and implementing sensible security policies. 
 Has anyone been in a similar position before? Where did you wind up?

Yes, i do the tech support, and I also have to document everything that happened during the call.

There is basically no ticketing system implemented, and it is really maddening when you come to think of it. What's your take on this? I'm 4 months in, and I'm already kinda burned out.

 About 4 years ago, after a security incident my company decided that AWS was the future and on-prem data center was the way of the dinosaur.
 It's that typical horror story where I have to assume something similar to the CEOs friend touted AWS while on the golf course and then issued the decree that we were going to the cloud. 3 years ago they said we'd be fully in AWS in 3 years. Migrations ground to a halt last year when a mid tier clients AWS environment blew by their annual costs to run in the DC in just 3 months at a fraction of the performance.
 Since the beginning they've been systematically promoting people who have a positive outlook on AWS and telling those who do not that they are not culturally fitting well with the company and driving the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about to embark on switchport-based network access control for a wired network.
 I have about 80 VLANs. I need NAC for about only 10 of them because they're more sensitive than the other 70.
 My environment:
 -Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices -Meraki switches (MS390) -Wired network (we aren't looking to do NAC for WiFi) -We want only device-based authentication so everyone on an authorized device can use it on that VLAN; have no use for user-based auth -Budget for this is almost $0 -We currently have an on-prem AD environment but it's gradually going away in favor of Azure AD
 If you were to do port-based NAC for devices on a few VLANs today, which solution would you use? I am currently shying away from Microsoft NPS because we are dismantling ADCS and our overall on-prem infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m part of a team at our org looking for ways to reign in our data governance policies because currently we keep and back up everything and have zero policy on what’s kept or for how long. 
 We’re also looking at a way that we can force sensitive documents to stay within a repository to prevent peaks to the outside world. For example, a financial doc that sits on our financial share shouldn’t be able to be copied off. However, our documents are so scattershot we have no idea what users have already squirreled away on their machines.
 We’re developing policy for these things now, but I’d love suggestions on tools / techniques used to enforce it. 
 Any input is very much appreciated
 Edit:
 We use Microsoft and Apple workstations, Windows and Linux servers, Google Workspaces and Office 365, On prem AD that syncs to Azure AD (so a hybrid AD environment)
 Our file servers are on prem. We have a lot of data in Google Drive and higher up’s are wanting to open up O365 for users to put docs in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apart from ansible or similar scripting tools, is there a standard way to manage ssh keys for your server? The context is when a team member leaves, I’ve no clue of their access. There’s no documentation that keeps track of it. So I need to ssh to each server and remove their key if found. First problem is keep the access documented which is already in process but apart from that is there’s anything which will help like SSO, where the identity is linked to AD and once their account is made inactive they shouldn’t be able to authenticate.
 I thought of writing a script which talks to AD server and allow/deny login using SSHCMD or something and keep it in every server but in event of AD failure it’d be impossible to login to any server. But it seems like a hack than a standard procedure.

 I know that ping TTL is unique to some devices but this is not something that always works as many vendors share the same TTL value. Are there ports usually open on a router that aren't on a PC? I suppose you could use host name too?

If my skills in an area are particularly strong I will tell them, and if they are a bit weak in other areas I'll tell them too (but of course I'll tell them that's an area I'm actively working on).
 I've stuck to honesty because I don't want to get a job that I can't do. The problem is that I then don't get much success from my interviews. 
 I have been involved in interviews and seen that a lot of candidates just lie and say they can do anything they get asked about and then come unstuck when it comes to the technical interview.
 ​
 So my question is - am I wrong for being honest? How much does everyone else embellish (or just plain lie)?

 - A user logs into wifi with their credentials (802.1x)
 - Each user is assigned a fixed subnet (a /28 in the 10 space, and a /64 in the v6 space) for their devices
 - The users would retain this block of addresses for the duration of their engagement with the organization. (Some of these users would have additional rules as well to coincide with regulatory requirements, or other reasons, these would most likely take place at the router and firewall levels) 
 I was investigating the possibility of using radius to assign a different vlan to each individual with the contained subnets, however this gets unruly assigning a different private vlan to several hundred different users. I'm wondering if there is a better solution out there someone could point me in the right direction. I'm working with Aruba hardware. 
 If someone can point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it. I'm recently reentering the network design world and discovering I'm forgetting more than I remember about this topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 Looking to learn a "cookie cutter" sort of speak network setup for small business.
 Yes... I do realize every business is different but the best way for me to learn is to have a goal and work towards meeting that requirement.
 Theoretical scope would be a small business such as a coffee shop, auto mechanic, dental office, insurance office, etc. Consisting of 10 ppl or less with computers, printers, mobile devices, 2-3 IP cameras, a file server or two, with occasional guests.
 Internet line would probably range from 200mb-1gb down and 50mb-200mb up
 My thoughts on equipment that would cover this range would be:
 ISP Modem > Router > Firewall > Switches > APs
 ISP Modem > Netgate 2100 > Unifi Switch Lite 8 POE > Unifi U6 Lite(s)
 Ive used Ubiquiti gear before so I think the POE switch and AP's would be a good fit. 
 Netgate 2100 is the router firewall VPN appliance I think I'm settling in to learn.
 Would this setup be a realistic real world configuration for a small business? 
 Ideally, I'd like to learn this and implement this into friends and family's businesses as a side hustle then expand to regular customers to grow even more.
 Thanks for your help and time!

I have a really good understanding of network fundamentals but have been out of practice now for 2 years since I got a new job more on the incident management side of things for a video game company. 
 I am looking for some resources to help me acquire the JNCIA-Junos certificate so I can make the jump to our networking department who uses mostly Juniper devices. When I was studying for my CCNA I got lucky and found a community college near me that offered a 1 year crash course to prep you for the CCNA. This included hands on labs and a ton of reading. I managed to get my CCNA after 2 tries and really enjoyed the networking job I had except for the fact that they where paying me 40k a year in Los Angeles which basically meant I was poor. 
 What I am looking for is some resources to study for the JNCIA this can include:
 Websites
 Youtube training videos
 Online paid courses
 Text books
 Anything really to help get comfortable with the Juniper command line 
 I am willing to pay for courses so anyting helps please. If anyone here has passed there JNCIA lets have a conversation. There are some oppertunities at my job for Networking but they are all for Juniper devices which I am not familiar with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm out of touch. It's been a few years (~10) since I built a new monitoring system and I'm looking for suggestions. Back in the day I had a nice Nagios setup with groundwork open source. I exposed the cgi-bin via a reverse proxy that required client certificates. Installed aNag app on my Android device and had a widget on my phone home screen. Net result was that if I (as an example) dropped a disk from my md-raid, my phone would get an active alert within 5 minutes.
 Now in 2023 I am looking to start fresh and ask for suggestions on a completely new monitoring system that meets that requirement. What will alert me within 5-10 minutes of a failed disk, to my Android phone? Active monitoring only, not something that pushes an email or something, since if that system failed, it could fail quiet. 
 All clients to be monitored are Linux and I'm only interested in free and open source tools. Right now I'm leaning towards checkmk/omd.

 SQL Service starts but remote connections over SSMS would throw this error.
 Cannot connect to SERVERNAME.
 The Target principal name is incorrect. Cannot generate SSPI conext (Microsoft SQL Server).
 I googled the error and it came down to a SPN issue. Basically the the gMSA account was unable to register SPN. I tried to register manually but AD said there was duplicate entry already.
 To finish the move to the new cluster I ended up creating an old school service account and set SQL to use it then remote connections to SSMS began working. 
 Any ideas why this gMSA didn't work. The 2 servers are in an AD group that I used when I generated the gMSA account. Any ideas, did I miss something?

 Two possible strategies for booting hosts from their assigned LUN:
  
Identical host HBA configs --they all get the same target WWPNs and target LUN ID. The pairing of each host to its designated LUN is done on the array side (i.e. each LUN is presented to only one host via export with the common LUN ID. For this project I'm using LUN zero everywhere).
 Present the basket of boot LUNs to the entire cluster of hosts; each LUN is "exported" with a unique LUN ID. Pair each host with its designated LUN by setting the appropriate target LUN ID on the host HBAs.
  
The first method strikes me as cleaner and safer. It's one less touch-point to worry about as hosts will have i…]]></summary>

 The scenario I was looking at is a restaurant that can only get one internet provider in the complex due to contracts. Main goal is to be sure POS and Alarm system still has connectivity then a few computers have basic low speeds 5mb+- to get by till the main internet line is resolved.
 Has anyone tried this or had some other cellular internet provider as fail over?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all-
 I handle networking for pro-av AVoIP applications including SDVoE and smpte 2110. These devices essentially all rely on multicasting, IGMP, and are in the realm of 10Gb to 25Gb per device/host. One issue that i've seen frequently in some courses panels in regards to switch stacking, is that by stacking switches you can quickly run into severe multicast flooding. Arista deals with this through what they call "Multi-cast Orchestration" on their own switches, and Netgear acknowledges it's an issue and says "Care should be taken" when stacking switches- however I haven't heard anyone mention how to actually prevent or stop that multicast flooding on a network without something like Arista's proprietary product. Is there a common approach to handling this I'm not aware of or some 3rd party product which can handle this? What is the "care" you would even take to prevent that form of multicast flooding? 
 The reason for the stacked switches is to achieve 100% redundancy, allow easier expandability, etc.

Each frequency has its own wavelength that it transmits off, the higher the frequency goes up, the more "aggressive" the wavelength, allowing for faster speeds again in combination with QAM etc... the lower end wireless frequencies (2.4ghz) have a "wider" wavelength, allowing for radio waves to travel further, at greatly reduced speeds and more i…]]></summary>

Black screen trying to RDP in to server
 
Services are down, and not able to open applications on servers
 
Server Manager error message at login. "This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action..."
 
Taskmgr.exe error message "No such interface supported."
 
 Which means most of business is down.
 The root cause seems to be related to file permissions changes in the GPO
 https://i.imgur.com/XQlHIEw.png
 https://i.imgur.com/Jx9ZJLI.png
 Manually restoring the permissions has been tried, but it was unsuccessful. Reverting the GPOs does not solve the issue as it does not revert the changes.
 It was supposed to go to test first. Unluckily it was applied to server OU. We'll of course take care of the administrator who did it, this is quite an unfortunate event. Is full restore the only way to go, or is it possible to fix it? Any ideas fellow sysadmins?
 Edit: The servers are not receiving updates to GPOs anymore. Any changes you do/remove/add a GPO will not be updated to any servers.
 Update from the morning of 19.02.2023: Shit guys we're deep in it, the restores are failing for some reason. Complete rebuild has been initiated while we are trying to find workarounds and get Microsoft escalation.
  
Some servers you cannot reach at all, while others you can actually get access to through management tools or run wmic.
 Domain Controllers not affected, GPO was applied to servers OU

 I was tasked with connecting my org's SSO solution to our Google domain so we could use 2FA. I thought I had set it up wrong because when I logged out and back in, there was no redirect to the SSO page; it just took my Google password as always. I did some digging and apparently the reason is that I'm a Super Admin for our domain and Google doesn't allow Super Admin accounts to use SSO (unless you're signing in from within a network mask...which I don't understand). I then tested it with multiple end user accounts, and the SSO redirect worked correctly.
 I'm confused. Wouldn't the Super Admin accounts have the biggest need for protection? These are the accounts with the highest privileges. I must be missing something here, right?
 Edit: I understand now. In my head I was thinking SSO implied 2FA, which it doesn't. You wouldn't want an admin account to be using SSO without 2FA but Google can't really enforce that without ruling out SSO altogether. I'll change the post flair. Thanks y'all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently scoping out firewall vendors for a potential replacement. Top 3 are Palo Alto, Fortinet, and Checkpoint. We have had Fortinet’s technical demo and have heard their claim that they are “best” due to a mix of value, ease of use and performance (Paralell Processing). Palo is scheduled this week to discuss why they are the best.
 our IT security team is pushing Checkpoint hard. Their basis is it’s the most secure and point to 2 things. Testing showing that they block way more attacks than all the others and a claim that there are no CVEs in the last 8 years. The first item I’m disregarding because it’s a checkpoint sponsored test comparing Physical Hardware to VMs. 
 However the second claim has me intrigued. I looked and there are really no publicly available CVEs listed for Checkpoint. With a system based so heavily on Linux and so many technical changes in the last 10 years, is it really feasible to have 0 CVEs? In my mind that is the IT version of “My shit don’t stink”. And if so, why is that platform so much more secure?
 Edit: Thanks to those who provided links. It sounds like I was right to call BS on the second claim. Much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 we are currently looking into switching to MFA through Azure AD with our Endpoint VPN solution. Everything fine so far except one part of the organization who use the VPN solution, but are not synchronized to our main Azure AD. They use their own Azure tenant.
 Synching them to ours as well (and license them) is not an option.
 I read about cross tenant access. But I don't get how I should be able to select a group from the other tenant in my Conditional Access policy for the App that controls the VPN solution.
 Do I have to look into B2B direct connect and somehow synchronize these users into our tenant? I would not want that. I tried adding a group through B2B direct connect that is allowed to access my tenant, hoping I could then select that group in CA - but it seems that's not how it works.
 Any hints appreciated - thanks!

I've gone over the configs dozens of times and everything looks perfectly fine; however, the links just will not come up.
 As an afterthought, I swapped out one of the (passive)QSFP-H40G-CU3M cables with a (active)QSFP-H40G-AOC3M cable and the link comes right up. We have 8 of the passives, as that is what Cisco sent with the BOM. Is there a config I'm missing somewhere to allow the passive cables to work? Or could it be that maybe the QSFP Microcontroller on the Nexus switches can't use the passive cables?
 The switches can see the transceivers, they just don't initialize the port.

 Greetings!
 Im a small ISP with just a lil over a gig of traffic in some isolated island somewhere in Asia. I have a contract with our local government units and department of education on improving their internet connection. I have observed that most of my network's traffic consists of google. About 40% to 50% google and another 40-50% facebook. Ive recently got my network its own ASN and public ipv4 ipv6. 
 Right now I have sent a request to google about it. Im just curious to know since on their website, it doesnt show any other requirements aside from having to have asn and ipv4 in RIR directory. 
 Does google require certain TRAFFIC to be able to qualify for GGC?
 THANKS!

 On Wednesday a vmware horizon VDI server that was stood up last week was compromised because the technicians responsible didn't install the log4j patched version of the server. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved.
 On Thursday a client's email was suspended due to breaching the terms of service of the incumbent email provider who they were still paying for service that is well below the tier of RackSpace because sales would not insist that a modern email service be used. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved. 
 I inherited the job of migrating an imap email server to m365 with an expected completion date of Friday whilst being the escalation point for 10 L1 technicians. This went as expected. 
 Last night I went home and had a panic attack. Theoretically if I cared enough about the client migration I would be working on all weekend but I don't because we were able to get the old email vendor to re-establish the account until we can migrate, I'm spending time on Indeed, Monster & Dice trying to find a life boat out of this hellhole.
 The point of this post is to never, ever, trust an MSP with your environment past the point of giving them a runbook or utilizing them for L1 helpdesk. Never give them administrator credentials. 
 If you ever think about being coerced into working for an MSP stick your hand in a rat trap, remember the pain, and realize that MSP is the hotel California of the IT profession. 
 Once you have that stink on you it's hard to get it off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone!! 
 Looking for some advice on how best I can continue my learning as well as whether I made a good choice: 
 I work as an IT Net Admin for an ISP. I have decided to take a job working for a federal contractor due to the pay increase and benefits for my family. 
 The job that I ended up taking is pretty much help desk stuff at a healthcare facility. 
 The trouble I think about is whether I made a choice that puts me back a few steps or if I've made a good choice. 
 Background:
 My current job as a net admin is pretty wtf imo. It was all good at first with my previous boss. Like I stayed within the confines of my JD but he left and now instead of being the net admin to all 3 separate departments, I'm stuck messing around trying to help 1. 
 Firstly, my boss doesn't know anything about Wi-Fi, networking and network devices. He does know voice stuff I guess? (supposedly. He basically relies on support to give him all the answers and then says it like he knew all along). 
 Secondly, I am technically supposed to resolve networking issues for the IT department as a whole, clients and most installs as well as build networks for projects but I'm too busy trying to run around and be the manager my boss isn't for 1 group that I wasn't even supposed to pay this much attention to. 
 Thirdly, I am honestly running around trying to be a dude in construction and find ways to get an install done for clients without having the company spend on contractors to do that work professionally. It's the weirdest thing ever. 
 Lastly, My JD explicitly stated I'm only supposed to be resolving network issues and build our large projects and when I bring this up I get the "I know. Thank you. You're really doing amazing." 
 There's more to the story but I'm really trying to not rattle on.

 Client has Windows 11 HP Notebooks, USB-C docks and Kyocera MFPs. KX Universal Printer Driver (v.8.3.0815).
 / Scenario A Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print, then click Print <Prints fine>
 / Scenario B Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print View Printer Properties (No changes) OK Click Print <Word hangs, doesn’t Print> [Killing Printer process makes Word resume]
 / Scenario C No Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print View Printer Properties (No changes) OK Click Print <Prints fine>
 This can only be reproduced:
  
When the Dock is attached (whether using LAN or WiFi).
 When the Printer Properties are viewed (to change colour, tray, etc).
  
If we disconnect the Dock, use LAN, all works fine.
 We have uninstalled AV, Office Add-ins, updated drivers, Windows update etc. 
 It does work with other printers and print drivers, but the client needs the Universal Printer Driver.
 I’ve ran Procmon and can see ‘Print Isolation Host’ doing it’s thing, touching Kyocera DLLs, and have captures from successful and failed prints. Nothing jumps out.
 The fact the dock is a factor makes me think there’s some kind of conflict or memory issue. 
 Any suggestions welcomed!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m learning about event driven architecture and investigating which message broker appears to be the best fit for me.
 I was looking into Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ and found that the former has a supplementary system named Apache Connect, which essentially allows to use a bunch of third-party connectors as event sources or event sinks.
 E.g. with Kafka, if I wanted to make an event “NewUserCreated” when a new row is inserted into Postgres database’s users table, I can just use a Postgres connector and configure it as event source (haven’t tried yet actually but I understand so). With Confluent, I can configure all of this with a visual GUI.
 But with RabbitMQ, would I need to be making custom connector scripts? E.g postgres database allows webhook trigger, so I make a cloud (edge) function that connects to RabbitMQ and sends the event.
 Or is there something analogous to Apache Connect but designed for AMQP message brokers like RabbitMQ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone else will have come across this. Generally speaking we purchase all devices through Apple Business account so it will already be in the Apple Business Manager but every now and then there’s a need for us (or a client) to purchase directly and the. Add to ABM manually. 
 What’s winding me up is how inconsistent this experience is.
 Normally it’s as simple as switch the device on, get to the WiFi part of setup and then if fire up Apple Configurator on another iPhone that’s signed into ABM, it detects this and the new device is added to the ABM. You then need to immediately change the MDM to InTune on ABM and force an InTune to ABM sync before you allow it factory reset. It’s then hit and miss on whether or not the device will get stuck at the “obtaining configuration from org” screen. So it’s already a bit flaky even for orgs where this is about as simple as it can be (single profile for that enrollment method) but “tends” to work. 
 That’s annoying but I can live with it. What’s annoying me more is that on some new devices fresh out of the box (and old that are factory reset) they refuse to pair up at the WiFi screen, nothing happens at all. Trying to find information on troubleshooting that aspect seems impossible. Very few people using the iOS Apple Configurator App it seems. 
 Posting here in the hopes that someone else has come across the issues above and has any advice on troubleshooting either of them?

I'm thinking of leaving but I shudder when I think of the potentially toxic environments that I may get into even though the pay may improve. My country is extremely notorious for having toxic corporate environments, weak labor laws, zero percent worker protection, political infiltration, and managers that are clueless & wicked, etc such that you actually find people quitting their good-paying jobs because of toxic environments -that is what I'm contemplating getting into. My current workplace doesn't stress me, the people are civil and the processes are professional and standardized. I consider myself blessed to be formally employed in a country with a 90% unemployment rate but my salary just barely scratches the surface as compared to equally qualified and experienced counterparts in other companies.

 Is it possible to somehow re-use a selfencrypting drive secured with a tool called Wave?
 Diskpart and Mac Disk Utility could not. Both report it to be some weird smaller capacity partitions than the disk actually is. These were old corporate notebook disks.
 Any ideas? Thank you

 We have Windows 10 (going to Windows 11 shortly) Hybrid Azure AD joined devices with LAPS setup. We are working towards getting our devices into Intune but aren’t there yet. 
 Remote devices have BitLocker with a Pin setup, and we had a theft of a laptop recently and luckily the device was BitLockered with decent pin, we reset user password and revoked 365 sessions for good measure – end of IT’s involvement. Everyone in our org has MFA enforced, we have configured recommended Conditional Access policies and we generally follow best practice where we can.
 But it got me thinking, if that laptop had not had a BitLocker Pin (TPM ONLY) or the Pin was weak (or user had written it down on a post-it note in the laptop bag…….) what would the thief been able to access? They wouldn’t have been able to caddy the drive due to TPM but could they have booted off a USB utility tool (Hiren or whatever it is now) and reset the Administrator password and then logged in as local admin and had access to the local user profiles and data?
 If so, is there anyway to mitigate this? I also note that deploying devices via Intune/AutoPilot, there is no out of the box/automated way of setting a unique TPM pin which wages a debate about if pin is even necessary.

 From what I've read, L3 is the way to go, bringing the L3 down all the way to TOR or even the server. Everything is routed, small L2 domains.
 As an example, the K8s networking plugin is Calico. This is a pure L3. Given a cluster-wide IP pool of 10.20.0.0/16, it carves out a smaller subnet (like a /26 by default) and assigns it to each node.

I ordered and received a server to replace this stand-alone hyper-v host. I worked with our vendor to order the new server spec'd like our current server. I don't know where the breakdown happened (I know I screwed up), but the new server did not come with the 2 10GB (SPF+) ports. To make matters worse, there are no available slots in install a card. Before I tell my boss we spent $25K on a server that we can't use, I'd like some feedback. This server's sole use is hosting these 2 Veeam servers. The network ports I have are 1GB. How screwed am I?

 I am looking for some career advice and was thinking this would be a good place to ask.
 I’m currently a network admin, and I focus heavily on config/management of Firewalls and anything behind them for our many customers (MSP).I switched from the Voice side in the same company to the data side about 6 months ago.
 I’ve asked for raises etc, and have not been able to get past $50,000 (In Indiana, with company for 2 years)
 I enjoy and am good at SIP, and was sent a job offer as a Voice Engineer for a large provider expanding into the US, for alittle over 70% more pay.
 To me, that’s life changing money.
 However, even though i feel underpaid, i think the amount of security knowledge i gain week after week is really valuable, and i always hear people talk about trying to break into security, and it seems like i have luckily been able to do so. 
 This new role sparks my interest very much bc i do enjoy voice, but I’m worried about leaving the security space and possibly making it harder to return after my VoIP arc 
 Thanks in advance for any advice!
 Tl;Dr 
 Currently feel underpaid in network security 
 I like voice and got an offer for 70% more as a voice engineer for a large company 
 Worried about it being hard to get back into security after i do VoIP for a couple years

 Edit: It would need to run Windows Server for AD and GPOs. The CPU was selected for the potential of a VM or two.

 HDD: 1TB 7.2K RPM SATA Entry 3.5in x2 in RAID1 for the OS
 OS: Windows Server 2022 Standard
 I would upgrade the OEM RAM with a 2x16gb kit of Crucial Memory since Dell’s memory prices are crazy

Bad patch cable. When I replaced the patch cable, couldtrax said it was online and couldn't communicate. No matter how many times I disconnected the ports to shut the device off from the server closet it wouldn't work. Had to get a 20 foot ladder and unmount and reseat the cable there. Magically it started working.
 ​
 THE BIG QUESTION
 When I have something that happens with a cable with one of these access points, do I need to go directly to the access point and reseat it?
 ​
 Notes: Monitoring it before, it was in and out with connectivity, and I think this was primarily because of the patch cable.
 I didn't test the wire run from the server closet to the AP. Did a constant ping with no issues, and thus far, it's been consistent with the other 2 AP's.

 (wire goes from access point to patch panel, from patch panel to PoE port on on injector, then injector port goes to switch).

The Atoms almost always fail and require a power cycle or a complete factory reset before the update can succeed. The AP250s exhibit the same behavior, but not as often. Sometimes I do have to deactivate PoE on their backhaul ports to get them to eventually behave.
 Every AP is backhauled btw, no mesh. 
 To troubleshoot, I've consoled into a couple while this process happens, but the logs I see give no clear indication of why updates could have failed besides some vague messages about losing connectivity to the cloud.. but they're rebooting and won't have connectivity to anything. The cloud console gives no information whatsoever after a failure. In the device list, the ones that eventually fail get stuck at 12% on the progress bar... for HOURS.
 These are all legacy Aerohive devices by the way. We had these before AH was acquired by Extreme. Are we running into some kind of planned deprecation situation? The thing that bothers me is even when we were running Aerohive's Mangler, this stuff still happened, but not as bad and way less frequent.
 Is extreme/aerohive's cloud management just this bad? Or is there something wrong with how these are deployed/operating? These things are workhorses. And after tuning the hell out of the system due to a high-density/high-interference environment, users have been happy. I'm actually very impressed with the flexibility and features these things provide. But upgrading them takes half a day or more... and it clenches my butt every time.
 Thanks for reading, and thanks for any insight anyone may provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit. I am asking because I saw a few UKG posts here before in searches. 
 My multi state grocery store company has used Kronos for a long time now. My new store manager started using UKG to create weekly schedules. So our schedules went from two pages to around eight a week. I am supposed to be able to us UKG Dimensions and see my Kronos punches and schedule. Well I put in the url that my company says to put in the UKG site and app. I can see my Kronos punches fine. But it randomly shows the schedule. Never the current schedule or upcoming, but it will show what it was two weeks ago sometimes. 
 What I am wondering is... Is there a box/setting the manager has to have selected while making the UKG schedule to have it show up on the UKG Dimensions website/app? I can find no UKG help board that does not require a sort of membership to even ask them. So I thought I would try here.

 So it was very simple task. User was not receiving an email from certain email address(it is a distribution list address) in their outlook. So I wanted to forward the email coming to that email address to user's email address. 
 To do this we have to change the mailbox in OWA to the distribution list address and set forwarding settings to user's email. But some reason my brain lagged and I forwarded user's email to that address. The user called me next day saying that there are no emails /receiving email in their outlook client/OWA. I immediately knew what I did and disabled the forwarding setting and they were able to receive emails again. But emails during forwarding setting was enabled was not in their mailbox. I checked with our l2 team and they said it impossible to do anything in this case. I also did not check keep a copy during forwarding. 
 So not only I did not do my job, I created a task for user where they have to request the sender to send the emails again which is a very troublesome task depending on how many emails they received during that time. I requested user to check if the emails could be sent again yesterday. Or they have to contact the distribution list owner and send their emails back. Now I am waiting for user response and depending on their response I might lose my job. I had a panic attack and still thinking about it. How I could do such a simple mistake. I am doing help desk for 1year and never felt like this. I am not sure If we can share this here. I just wanted to share it to someone.

 We would like something that can update via wifi to show if the room is in use or not but which does not require constant recharging like the usual scheduler iPads and tablets do.
 Even the union electrical and AV guys who helped us configure the space did not have a great cost effective solution. So I wanted to see if one of you had found a good workaround for this already so we don't have to reinvent the wheel for no good reason.

 I am somewhat the sole operator of a virtual production LED studio. I've been tasked with a lot of tech that I do understand and some I don't mostly related to server networking & ability to send data wirelessly. 
 We will start with the wireless data:
 I have a tracking system called Mosys. It is run on an intel nuc (rehoused with custom software). It feeds data back to one of our network switches via ethernet- which we then send to the server that processes the data. Since this is mounted on a camera, there are a lot of benefits of wireless transmission. While it is a pc (running a flavor of linux) I wanted to know my options for running wireless signal from this pc to our ethernet switch. The pc has usb ports which already support mouse/usb.

If anything, it seems like the issue has gotten worse. The only fix that helps temporarily for most systems is to push a in place upgrade task sequence via SCCM. This seems to correct whatever component store/SXS corruption initially, but the problem is it seems like for many systems, the problem resurfaces in a month or two. We've since had two Premier tickets with Microsoft without any identification of a root cause. We have looked for various underlying trends such as build process, PC model, installed features/software, antivirus, etc but have been unable to pin it down. We're still using WSU, but we don't believe the issue is on the update server side. It just seems that at some point these machines get corrupted and no amount of SFC or DISM will fix them. In place repair will fix them but only temporarily. Anybody else deal with similar issues? It's frustrating to deal with in an environment where 100% patch compliance is expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been setting up networking (internet and cameras) for a small hotel and restaurant in the Caribbean for the past 3 years. They started off small (just 1 building) but they keep growing. They own about a whole acre of land where they keep building small "bungalows" and container rooms. Now they decided to buy the property across the street and covert it to another 5 rooms for the hotel. They want internet and IP cameras across the street. The "street" is unpaved, and the other property is 84 feet from the office where I keep the modem and router. I'm leaning toward using Cat 6 or fiber to span this distance. My business partner wants to use a Ubiquity air max bridge. I haven't set one of these up, so I don't know how reliable or complicated they are. Theres no vegetation in the line of sight, but it rains a lot. Currently I use a Huwei LTE modem/router with 3 Unifi AP's. I think I am going to add a load balancing router so I can use two ISPs for more consistency and speed. 
 The owner said we could bury a conduit if we want. Also I could hypothetically use the utility poles to span cable (is that a good idea)? I want something thats going to work 99% of the time. I don't live down there so if theres a problem, I have to call and walk someone (usually with very little IT experience) through how to reset a device or trouble shoot. I need reliability.
 I do want to future proof this. If you bury conduit, how deep do you normally go and what diameter do you use? Would you use fiber, Cat 6 cable or a wireless bridge? I really appreciate any help you can offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s your top advice to someone starting a new sysadmin role?
 What should my 30/60/90 day objectives be?
 How should I “manage“ my manager eg. if there’s no structured 90 day on-boarding process, how do I create one? My experience at past roles has been varied, usually am told to read documentation, check the backlog & review the ticketing system to get familiar with common issues. I feel like there’s a better way to set myself up for success.
 I have the natural instinct to want to “fix everything“ and jump right in to the backlog to look productive. Is this a good idea or should I spend a few days/weeks understanding the environment? I want to be helpful but I don’t want to come off as a know-it-all who says everything needs to be changed. Also, I’m aware that some organizations want the end solutions but don’t want the pain of change, so it‘s never a simple process. I feel that starting with documentation may be a better start and mapping out how the IT infrastructure is designed, but not sure what’s next before getting in the weeds.
 I want to make a good impression and ramp up quickly. But I don’t want to set an expectation that I will work late because I need work/life balance to be physically & mentally healthy. Is it a bad look to go home on time when you’ve just started a new role.
  
Thank you for the advice!

 However, when I am on my deathbed, and I am about to die, my purpose will be for nothing. For me to survive, that life is gone. And the rich just got richer. nothing else will have benefited from what I have done, and this life seems complete wasted.
 How do you live a purposeful life after contributing to not much. What do you do outside of work that gives fulfillment. Especially that our existence is of nature, and we sit behind computer screens all day.

 Please bear with me as my ineptitude may show. For history, most of my professional career has been in enduser support. Recently a colleague of mine left and encouraged me to apply for his old position as a network specialist.
 I took the time to relearn what i could and played in a simulated environment and did i ever learn the hard way how different real hardware vs simulation can be. Anyhow, to the question. During the interview we had to complete a skills test that was set up in a collapsed core configuration:
 Cisco catalyst 9500 as the core/distribution switch and a Cisco Catalyst 9300 as the access. One of the Objectives was to set up an etherchannel link between the distribution and access layer switches and using port channel 1 as the container. The directions were vague so I assumed they'd leave it up to the interviewee to choose PAgP or LACP so i opted to set each side to channel group mode on. When I tried to apply the configuration both the 9500 and 9300 spit out "command rejected" I forget the exact verbage. In the end, I ended setting the distribution switch to channel group mode active and the access switch to passive and the etherchannel relationship formed. My I'm just scratching my head as to why mode on was rejected.
 EDIT: fixed some grammar and verbage

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will try to make this explanation short. My company uses an old Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) that uses Java as part of its components. It is truly solely IE dependent for other reasons as well. I have established that over the last 4 years since I began here. I, of course sounded the alarm years ago to management repeatably that IE had an expiration date. They began the lengthy project of upgrading to a cloud version roughly a year ago. This project also is folding in two other ERP programs into this upgrade so you can imagine the huge amount of work going into this. We are projected to go live with this in May.
 I missed the announcement from Microsoft that they would be putting an arrow through the heart of Internet Explorer on Valentines day and I am just discovering users that have had it updated. Basically if you try to use IE it automatically redirects to Edge. The previous settings in Edge under settings>default browser" allowed you to disable the redirect. That is all gone now. I have tried uninstalling all the MS updates on their computers from Feb 14 to date. But none of them seem to give back the capability to use IE. It seems to be the version of Edge 110.0.1587.46 had the options available so that you could stop it from redirecting. Now under version 110.0.1587.89 they are gone. I am trying to find a way to roll this back and possibly stop a major work stoppage for my company. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Ya'll,
 I'm deploying DOT1X EAP-TLS port authentication with a fallback guest VLAN on Cisco Catalyst C3850 switches used for access to offices and shared workspaces. I've followed the Cisco guides and have the proof of concept system working.... mostly. I am running into an issue with DHCP after assignment to the guest VLAN. When authentication fails or times out the port is assigned to the guest VLAN. However the Windows DHCP service times out and self assigns an AIPA address before the DOT1X authentication failure/timeout occurs. The Windows machine will then sit on the Guest VLAN without an IP address for approximately 5 minutes before the Windows DHCP service reattempts a DHCP request and is successful.
 The reason I'm asking this here, is that I would like to adjust my switch configs to account for this since theoretically devices getting assigned to the guest VLAN won't be under my control to adjust Windows DHCP settings.
 Is there a best practice or recommended DOT1X auth timeout?
 The proof of concept is using this setup on the ports:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/X
 switchport mode access
 device-tracking attach-policy dot1x
 authentication event fail action authorize vlan 5
 authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 5
 authentication open
 authentication port-control auto
 authentication timer reauthenticate 180
 authentication violation replace
 dot1x pae authenticator
 dot1x timeout start-period 5
 dot1x timeout held-period 1
 dot1x timeout auth-period 18

 Based on responses and testing, this is the fix that has worked 100% of the time so far for us. Logging out of the effected user and logging back in as a different user and running this script renames the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy folder and when you log back in as the user it recreates the folder and seems to fix the issue.

 Today we've made changes to our VPN, so we need to rename the Service name in our fixvpn script, and therefore need to update the fixvpn.ps1 file.
 However, the only way I can get Group Policy to actually roll out the updated file is to set the Action to "Replace". This isn't ideal as it means that every time a computer runs gpupdate/logs in, it will download that file, and the "Apply once, do not reapply" setting doesn't seem to work with "Replace". I also have no idea how long a computer can go for without being booted up/signed in, so it's less of an 'enable and forget' thing.
 I even tried resaving the file under a different name temporarily, deleting the old file, and uploading the new file with the correct name, in case it was leaning on some kind of file ID or creation date, but still, the script remains unupdated.
 Am I really supposed to run this under "Replace" and have files copied over from SYSVOL every 90 mins?

 We have no real way to prove this as we are in Canada, but ever since the Earthquakes, some of our workers in India have been complaining about latency. Its not all the ISPs that seems to be affected, but the timing is almost spot on.
 Just wondering if you are seeing something similar? 
 In most cases we are seeing a 100ms to 150ms increase from the normal.

Mails are neither sent nor recieved. First user reported it on Monday, it was solved with 2 reboots, other user was solved with creating a new profile after the Outlook repair kicked in. But we also have two users where the local Office programs straight up do not work anymore. Word, Excel display the Yellow Warn symbol top right next to the profile pic. Also displaying the "Account Problem log in again" and when you click on it, the MS login/MFA windows appears with "Please wait" and closes. Sign-In protocols in Azure for the affected users are all successful. Even tried the Outlook repair thingy, which created a new profile, but after that we were not able to add the users account to Outlook. It just fails. For Excel and Word, when you try to open a File from SharePoint in the Desktop App, you get an access-denied error, when you say open it Excel/Word online no problem. According to MS support try to close all Office programs, delete all saved Windows Login Credentials regarding Office and OneDrive. But the affected users only have OneDrive creds stored, as I have both, so maybe this is a step torwards a solution.The Web "Variants" work without a problem for the affected ones, so it's a viable workaround atm.
 Infos: O365, Exchange Online, Hybrid Azure AD
 Maybe someone has the solution or some hint.Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just curious as I'm trying to, slowly, learn to use Wireshark properly. Some years ago I stayed in a big chain hotel in London next to the British Library. Bored in my room I did a network scan of the free WIFI they provided. To my horror I could see everyone else's device, even an old server I think they may not have been using anymore that appear to monitor temperatures. I reported this while there and they promptly locked everything down (essentially just turning on WIFI isolation).
 This time I'm on a cruise ship and not brought my Alfa card with me. Not done an nmap scan as I know about the legality of that. But thought running WIFI shark while I'm connected to check my on ship account shouldn't hurt. But noticed loads of MDNS entries at all the other guests devices. All their device names. Surely this shouldn't be visible if they had WIFI isolation on?
 Isn't this a slight security issue or am I making something of nothing because I'm just not understanding the Wireshark trace?

 My org is about to implement a new to us ticketing system (ServiceNow). As part of that, we proposed rebuilding our monitoring environment from scratch in order to remove as much of our decade of customization as possible, as it has built-in integration with ServiceNow.
 We are currently using Solarwinds SAM and NPM to monitor our environment - Windows, RHEL, AIX, vCenter & ESX, Nutanix AHV, and Cisco/F5/CheckPoint/PaloAlto networking equipment (along with a few random other manufacturer devices we're monitoring via SNMP); including some items on AWS and Azure.

 I've got a test environment with two Cisco 3560CGs connected together with a link agg. Each port is a 1gb port.
 ​
 Each switch has a port with the same vlan on it. At the end of each vlan is a PC with a 1gbNIC.
 ​
 When doing an iperf test between the PCs, my network monitoring software is suggesting that it is only saturating 1 link out of the two with about a gig of traffic.
 ​
 I was under the impression it would balance the load across the two? Or would this only happen if I was able to generate more than a gigworth of traffic?
 ​
 Thaks for the help!

 Any thoughts on reasons why I may want to install an agent to specifically backup AD?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm junior system administrator in small company and I've been given a task to redesign network topology since current one is quite awful. We just bought 2 Huawei 10Gb switches and 5 new servers with 4 10Gb NICs each. I'm not sure how I should set up the network core.
 I was thinking of stacking switches in master/slave configuration, then use LAG to connect my servers to the core. 4 servers' NICs bond into 1 logical NIC, and split 2/4 cables to one switch and the remaining 2/4 to the other. As I understand it, this should give me high redundancy (one whole switch can die and connection will still be ok) and high throughput (some traffic will come to main, some to secondary; total speed should be around 35-40Gb).
 ​
 Is this setup viable, am I going the right way, will it be manageable in the future?

 I assumed connection issues but this has been with a mix of on-site and remote workers so seems less likely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone.
 So today was the first time in my professional life that I outright snapped.
 I got an email this morning regarding an external audit, and that the auditor requested access to specific documents within our organization, you know, standard stuff.
 In my ignorance, I thought that the user would simply share a OneDrive folder/make a team/create a Sharepoint site.... or at least call me for help... but oh no...
 I got an email stating "I solved the issue, and we now have a Dropbox account with all the sensitive info publicly available, have a nice day"
 I never thought I got get this angry with a user, but here we are...
 I promptly called said user, deleted the documents, deleted Dropbox (considered deleting the user from existence), create a OneDrive folder with said documents and shared it with only the auditors.
 While this was going on, the user kept saying that it was my fault that the user was forced to use Dropbox, that the user could not bother to ask me for simple stuff like this and that the user did not receive any formal IT training in all the years the user had been alive, which also was my fault.
 You can guess how my reaction to this barrage of BS went... 
 I hope you all had a better morning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just read this article: https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/2017/03/virtual-machine-vcpu-and-vnuma-rightsizing-rules-of-thumb.html
 The examples at the end make it clear how I should rightsize my VMs to align with the physical host. The problem is, we have clusters with ESXi hosts with different # Cores and different # Sockets. For example, in one cluster we have a host with 6 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620), 8 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz) and 12 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz). 
 The cluster is EVC enabled with at Intel® "Sandy Bridge" Generation. These CPUs typically have 1-4 Cores. (4-6 Extreme, 2-8 Xeon).
 I'm a bit confused how I align my vCPUs in this example. I would assume I align with the host with the least amount of cores, so 6. Btw, we are running ESXi 7.0.3.
 Example 1: VM with 4 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 1 socket with 4 cores 
 Example 2: VM with 8 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 2 sockets with 4 cores 
 Example 3: VM with 16 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 4 socket with 4 cores 
 Am I getting this right?

 after 9 years in IT, I had my big upsi moment.
 I was setting up a new WSUS in an environment. It was planned to rollout monthly updates in 4 rings. Test, Auto update 1, Auto update 2, manual update. So far so good. Created the gpo and put the servers in the group.
 Well, yesterday it happened... The downloaded 02.2023 Update was downloaded the day after patchday. So far so good. Only the servers within the Test group installed it. BUT then yesterday, every server just went to the WSUS, installed the updates and rebooted automatically. Even the ones that are in the manual group.
 ​
 The thing that confuses me the most is
  
I put in a time, when the servers should NOT restart --> get's ignored
 The updates were planned to be installed at the end of this week + next week
 No matter if I put the "Configure automatic update" GPO to option 4 (auto download, install and reboot to schedule) or to option 3 (auto download notify for install), they'll always immediately download and install them.
  
I have no clue what's wrong and tried to re-create this behavior in my LAB. So far I don't run into the same issue...
 ​
 Will have a review later today. Guess I better prepare to get a new job...

Atm, we have antiquated group polices setup on about 100 workstations (used by medical staff) that the county IT people refuses to fix and frequently interrupts work. I have a big meeting with every manager involved and some changes could happen due to finger pointing between us contractors and county officials. 
 Essentially my wishlist would be to have county setup a separate domain controller with no original scripts running, so I can implement what I see fit. 
 I believe all I would need access to is a server connected to countydomain2 correct? 
 I should have no issue swapping user profiles from one domain to the other. I also believe that they will still be able to access their original county controlled emails via outlook correct? 
 Am I going about this completely wrong or is there something I'm missing?

 currently in our production we have a special vlan for cnc machines and a special vlan for clients in the production. Most of the machines are using SMBv1 (you cant change that, because most of them are too old) and I want to implement a SMBv1 Proxy for this.
 The clients access the machines directly over SMBv1 to their network shares to integrate or remove the production files on the machine.
 Unfortunately I dont have the real time to get in the topic so I'm searching for a company which could do that and also maintain this solution (most important part). 
 Any idea of companies which do that kind of "production" things?

Used to be able to remove a few things, run a couple rounds of windows updates and throw on the domain and it was fine. Seems like for the last couple years we always have to reimage the laptop. If we don’t we have issues with the CPU maxing out at 100% on weird built in system processes. Anyone else see that and/or have a solution for It. It’s also weird that we don’t have to do it on the desktops we get from them.
 For reference we’re a relatively small shop and don’t have put out a ton of laptops all the time. I’d say 2-3 a month. If we didn’t have to do a full reimage, we typically install office 365, sophos AV, ninja RMM client, forticlient VPN, run a round or two of windows updates then add the computer to the domain. I also run Dell command update and remove optimizer.
 Just looking for any suggestions other than reimage them every time. I’ve built MDT servers in the past so I know that’s an option, but don’t think i do enough computers to justify the time investment yet.

 But.. I’ve got this client with an assortment of printers. All 5+ years old, some are Xerox Phaser, some HP LJs, they all suck. One phaser says MPC error randomly until you reboot it. One LJ has black streaks (client buys knockoff toner because apparently the legit stuff is too expensive), another LJ prints rainbow like all the cartridges leaked. One HP LJ ghosts images / print. My recommendation is to replace them, or go with MFPs that are proper and under a support contract, but the client just expects me to magically fix all these. 
 Is this a legitimate frustration, or is this something an experienced IT admin should be able to do, and do I just suck?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 I have always been confused with the retention policies in M365. So hopefully someone here can clarify this for me. 
 If you enable retention policy to retain all data indefinitely in M365 via Microsoft 365 Data Lifecycle Management so it applies globally to all M365 apps (exchange, onedrive, sharepoint etc.). What happens if you disable a user account and remove the license?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users One Drive?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users emails? I know its not going to create inactive mailbox but can you still search the emails from/to this users via eDiscovery?
 - What happens after 30 days, 60 days or 90 days when the standard Microsoft retention period (outside M365 Data Lifecycle Management) expires? Will the data get deleted or will the retention policy kick in and all data will still be available via eDiscovery?
 The key here is, I dont care about restoring user data, it is more for compliance/legal purposes so as long as their data is searchable and can be found within e-discovery, I am happy.
 I keep getting conflicting messages from few M365 consultants. Some saying you need to delete the account when the license is still intact otherwise retention policy wont kick in. Others are saying it should apply the retention policy setup globally regardless. I dont want to find it the hard way so im just gathering some information here and there while waiting an official answer from M$.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are the facts of the situation:
  
We are an MSP with a central office that has a backup appliance.
 
Our customers' servers send data backups to this appliance daily. 
 
Our office and all customers have static IP public IPv4 addresses.
 
Data comes in on TCP 35116 and 35117 which is port forwarded to our backup appliance (see below before you gasp :)
 
 Here is what we do to secure this
  
The office firewall drops all inbound traffic on 35116 and 35117 (actually all ports) unless it is coming from a customer IP address. We maintain an alias in our firewall for customer IP addresses
 
Backup files are encrypted with a 2048bit key as they are generated at the customer site. They cannot be read without this key
 
The connection itself is TLS from the customer server to the backup appliance
 
The backup client at the customer sites must have a seperate 2048bit key in order to connect and have Read/Write access to the backup appliance
 
The backup appliance is off domain and uses a separate set of credentials from anything else
 
  
Here is the debate.
 A coworker is pretty insistent that we should be running these connections over a VPN of some sort. Either OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec maybe. I have countered that since the backups themselves are encrypted AND are being sent over TLS, this is not necessary and would harm performance.
 What do you think? Is adding a site-to-site VPN (with appropriate firewall rules and controls) to this setup worthwhile?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps someone has seen this before, when I enable the following on the switch stack consisting of two Cisco 9300s, the second switch cannot handle the config sync and reboots itself, showing the error in the log that this is causing the sync issue.
 archive
 path flash:archives/$h
 maximum 14
 write-memory
 I assume this is due to the path, can the standby switch write to flash? or can it not handle the $h variable? I want to set up local config change logging and backups at the very least, because the network team for this org has let it all go to hell, and now I have to fix everything and do it myself, hell they didn't even set up SNMP properly, all the network devices are using RADIUS servers half way around the world away when we have some locally... just a mess.
 Any advise on maybe setting up better management of the local devices is welcome as well, maybe there is an open source solution I can run locally to at least manage the configs?

 I manage at max, maybe 50 computers and 25 servers actively and it gets hard sometimes. I use a mix of AnyDesk for personal machines, Mesh Central, and traditional RDP for more business related systems. 
 Sometimes ensuring systems are up to date, secured, deployed correctly, configured with up to date information, etc gets really difficult, I wanna know how y'all do it. 
 I have deployed some servers that run by themselves pretty okay; they provide the services they need too and do it well. They auto update, and I automated some of the trivial tasks. But some machines, I feel like I can't leave alone or else they will become problematic. I want to know how y'all manage these kinds of systems or manage a fleet in general. 
 I don't even have 100 machines and it seems to be overwhelming at times.

 I've been working with FTDs as well as Checkpoints and Palos for a few years and everywhere I look (especially this sub lol), I can see frequent jokes about the FTD platform.
 I mean, I kinda get it, the platform didn't start out well and was a hot mess until recently when they managed to catch up a bit in my eyes. But when I read the discussions, it seems to me that everybody thinks it's a completely wasteful investment to any deployment.
 So what do you guys think? Is it still that bad as everyone says?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a heads-up: Contrary to chatter on the Internet and Microsoft's own patch notes, I have now confirmed the Secure Boot problem caused by KB5022842 (the February 2023 update for Windows Server 2022) also affects installations other than on VMware.
 I have two machines that are running Server 2022 on bare metal, and that are now refusing to boot due to Secure Boot failure. Other machines appear to be unaffected. The two in question boot after Secure Boot is disabled. Both happen to be older desktop-class computers used for software testing purposes, but I wouldn't put money on this problem only affecting non-server class hardware. (HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Mini, Lenovo M93p Tiny; confirmed that both have the latest firmware available.)
 As others have noted, the problem only shows itself on the second reboot after KB5022842 is installed.
 Be careful! I'd be willing to bet that this problem affects a lot more machines than is currently being reported. Might be worth pre-emptive testing to ensure a panic doesn't ensue if Server 2022 machines need to be restarted in the course of business before this problem is fixed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the early 2010s when was but a young Sysadmin I went to an architecture office with roughly a dozen users, one switch, Linksys router\wifi (you know... normal stuff) and We were upgrading them to a POE switch, IP phones, business grade router, new PCs, monitors, the whole network in a box sales job. Everything was pretty normal until I noticed everyone was watching me as I entered "Bobs office" just to see my reaction. 
 Bob was a special kind of hoarder. Bob liked his paper. Blueprints, White plotter blueprints, Legal sized paper, A4 for some reason, and normal Printer paper. You would think this is normal... and you would be wrong. Bob had this paper from print jobs EVERYWHERE. My words cannot easily describe what I mean by EVERYWHERE. The entire floor.... white paper. Every surface in the office, paper with an avalanche of paper drifting down to the floor... His chair HAD PAPER IN IT with some weird blueprint rolls off the back of the chair making a backrest. I have no idea if his desk was wood or metal because all I saw was paper avalanching off of the 2 sides of the desk not against the wall all the way down to the floor. His monitors were sat on mounds of paper and I had to remove the paper FROM ONTOP OF HIS KEYBOARD!!! Mentally picture fresh powder on a mountain ready for skiing, but replace the snow with paper, this was his entire office, floor to nearly celling. The door would not close because of the 3+ inches of paper on the floor. A normal box of printer paper is 5,000 sheets. His office easily had 500,000 sheets of paper in it, and that may be a conservative estimate because I am over here doing math on how much volume that many sheets of paper would be, and its still not enough. 
 When I left the office I played it cool and asked when their last inspection from the Fire Marshall was, the Office Managers face got red and she mumbled something about having "Bob pick up after himself".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am extremely interested in automating some tedious manual tasks I preform on a monthly basis.
 I know a little bit of powershell (I know a little python too) and I have been attempting some test scripts working up towards my actual automation project.
 I'm open to delving into Python or Powershell if any of you experienced automaters think I will have a much easier time of things with one or the other.
 Now this is a windows environment (If powershell didn't make that obvious lol) and I am running into all sorts of permissions and security issues.
 ​
 The eventual goal is to have a script (When does a script turn into a program lol) that can go out to multiple PCs on my network, check the version of an application against the version I specify, and then run an .exe if the version is previous.
 So obviously a program roaming around the network launching executables is not something Windows appreciates.
 ​
 I'm just playing in a test environment at the moment, but I'm starting to have doubts about how anything I ever write would be able to be ran in prod due to security factors.
 ​
 Am I missing something here? I do NOT come from a coding background, I'm more of a Windows/Networking generalist. I feel like learning to automate is a really good step in my career so I want to push myself to learn this. I think there might be a few concepts I'm missing that would make this "click" for me.

 Thank you for your time

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if anybody has any real world experience with this combination of devices. We're in the process of upgrading from our old 5508 controllers (and 2700/2800 series APs) to a pair of 9800-L WLCs with 9115 APs. Nothing new is in production yet, we're still in the planning phase, and we're trying to figure out how difficult this will be (we're in a manufacturing environment where some sites work 3 shifts and almost never shut down).
 According to this compatibility matrix, it should work. Here's a screenshot of the relevant section.
 I've got one of the 9800s online and I've got a spare 2702 AP that I'm testing with. I've installed 17.3.4c to the WLC installed the specific AP firmware from the table but so far I haven't been able to get them to talk. This very well could be user error so far since I'm not that familiar with this thing yet.
 I'm just wondering if anybody can confirm these work together. This would be much easier if we could just swap out the controllers with the existing APs in place and then swap out the APs one by one (we've got the controllers but the APs aren't due to ship for several months yet). Otherwise this will get convoluted quickly.

 After that I had no business wanting to be involved with the IT department anymore. I requested that you guys handle everything from New York and just leave me out of it.

I haven't run into this on any other device so I'm a bit confused. From what I can tell everything appears like it should work, but I can't get the networks connected to "CORE-DEVICE" to talk to Loopback1 on "DEVICE-A". Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. I've been tinkering with this for too long and am lacking ideas.
  
The interface I'm trying to access is a loopback interface - 10.10.1.50.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been fighting with this for a few days and am wondering if anyone else has a Dell N3048P using TACACS to hit Clearpass. I haven't been able to find anything searching around on forums or on Aruba/Dell support pages. I believe the issue is with my Dell's AAA configuration. I've tried several variations but nothing has seemed to get past CPPM to hit the Access Tracker. I have services built out for Cisco, Aruba, and Brocade with no issues. 
 CPPM is showing a "warn" in the event viewer for a failed TacacsServer request. "Authorization request for unauthenticated user = blahblahblah". The device is added to CPPM and a device group. I changed the secret in CPPM and then started receiving an error about the secret having a mismatch so that isn't an issue.
 Dell AAA config:
 aaa authentication login "defaultList" enable local tacacs
 aaa authentication login "tacacs" enable local tacacs
 aaa accounting commands "dfltCmdList" start-stop tacacs
 aaa accounting commands "1" start-stop tacacs
 aaa accounting commands "15" start-stop tacacs
 aaa authorization exec "dfltExecAuthList" local tacacs
 ​
 I'm mainly curious if anyone has this setup on their network and might have an easy answer for me. I'm about to call Aruba TAC but I doubt they are going to do anything since the issue seems to be with Dell which we no longer have support on.

 I'm currently trying to figure out my best path forwards with a Firewall migration.

 (Default routes marked by arrows)
 At present no dynamic routing is in use (yes I know). The Legacy Firewall has routes back to the Legacy L3, the Legacy L3 has routes back to the new L3.
 The intent was to use PBR on the new L3 so that subnets could be moved from using the Legacy L3 as their default gateway one at a time, so that the associated VIPs and rules on the Legacy Firewall could be moved individually rather than in one large cut-over migration. (There's a lot of legacy mess and shared VIPs with static NATs that need to be cleaned up as part of the process)

 Long story short, I'm distributing routes with a peer from another company but I'm unable to use AS paths to reliably determine upstream route preferences. The only way I've found is to subnet sizes to determine the preferred path, but I'm currently limited to advertising /31 routes that peer. Since the other company is massive, it takes a lot of effort and paperwork for them to make changes, I'd rather do this on our end if possible.

 Walked into an old environment and was asked to remove an old pki infrastructure. The environment consists of a root CA and a Sub CA. The root CA doesn't exist anymore, the VM has been deleted a long time ago and no backup is available. Root certificate is still valid for a long time
 Most of the issued certificates we've already revoked. The only ones left now are certificates issued to the domain controllers via the domain controller template. 
 What would be the cleanest way to remove AD CS since the root CA doesn't exist anymore and more important what would be the impact on the domain controllers if we revoke those certificates or remove AD CS.

 We’ve encountered a tricky situation at one of our customers and are out if ideas. The problem is the following: 
 We got Azure ADDS setup and a AVD server in the environment.
 Each day the users have to sing in to Office, Teams, Onedrive and so on which gets a bit frustrating. Since the server is just AzureAD joined and we have no way to issue hybrid functionality for SSO through an ADDS-server the users get no primary refresh token for SSO after Windows sign in.
 We’ve been investigating how we can overcome this with no luck other then installing an ADDS-server to setup Hybrid join on to hybrid join the AVD-server. We see this as an absolute last resort and would like to make this work with the current setup. 
 Have any of you encountered this issue? Any ideas how to proceed with the current setup or are we out of luck?

 On the MS overview page, they state:
 "Windows LAPS is supported on desktop Windows, Windows Server, and Windows Server Core. Windows LAPS is a native Windows feature on all supported SKUs. No extra steps are required to install the feature.
 As noted earlier, Windows LAPS currently is available only in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25145 and later."
 Does anyone know if Windows 10 will see this, or would this just be a MS incentive to push companies towards migrating to Windows 11?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, we are looking at refitting some of our meeting rooms. Our original set up was completed on a bit of a budget and with zero time, we have an Intel NUC mounted behind a TV with a standard Windows 10 install. We then run a Jabra speaker/mic device under the floor that pops out on top of the desk. We also have a webcam mounted ontop of the TV. 
 Joining a meeting is super simple, you enter a pin to unlock the PC, Teams is set to auto open to the calendar upon login and you just click Join on your meeting. Its basically just a standard PC plugged into a TV with an external mic/speaker and webcam.
 We are being asked to look at some teams meeting rooms, which personally I dont think is necessary because the meeting rooms themselves work fine. We are just looking to splash some cash since we have some left over come tax time.
 My main concern is, during meetings no one wants to use their work laptop to share their screen in big presentations. They just put their powerpoint on a network share and run it off the NUC, but they still like to use their personal machines to share their just for quick bits and peices like <4 quick catchups. If this even possible with a Teams meeting using something like a logitech tap? Or do you HAVE to share your screen using your personal machine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Not sure if this exists yet, but can we create an International BGP community standard or something along those lines for advertising your prefixes so we know what Country/State/Province/Region/etc your prefixes are located?
 We operate a latency sensitive network and have to constantly filter certain prefixes from being learnt via certain AS' so they have optimal routing and it is a tedious task. 
 This is where I had the idea that surely there had to be a better way and the first thing that came to my head is BGP communities that will identify the Country/State/Province/Region/etc. For example, an ASN with the 123.123.123.0/24 prefix in Japan Hokkaido Region can have a BGP community of 11:1 announced with their prefix. 11 being the Country (Japan) and 1 being the Hokkaido Region. (Side note: I really hope we end up giving Japan 11 as their BGP community code as a *tips fedora* to Code Geass).
 I'll admit this is not fully thought through yet and I wanted to open up the discussion to the networking community to hear their thoughts. The first issue I can forsee is AS' that strip BGP communities. In my head this International BGP community standard would be most useful in IXs.
 TLDR; If you operate an ASN can you advertise your prefixes with a BGP community that will identify the Country:/State/Province/Region/etc? An International BGP community codes standard for the BGP communities would be great.

 I'm working for small-medium company that have had it's IT processes really messed up before we came and implemented Azure AD, Intune, Office365 etc. Asset management in the past was just an excel spreadsheet that is not accurate anymore. This company has offices in different countries but, ultimately, the main one is in UK. What finance needs is to have a direct link between the invoice that came with the laptop or monitor for example, who has it assigned now and ultimately, they want to have to option to see the cost in GBP even if the laptop was bought in Morocco for example, using MAD as a currency. Depreciation in the app is also a must have
 ​
 Is there any web app that can do asset management with regards to this specific financial details? I was looking at BlueTally but i don't know if it can have multiple currencies or something like that.
 ​
 Any info would be much appreciated.

I think it might be the imaging drum but it still shows as 60% and I dont want to spend a ton of money without making sure what the issue is. Checked the warranty on HP's site, still good. To get the support phone number, the page says I have to signup (red flag #1), so I ignored that, and found the number somewhere else.
 Called the local line, got the song and typical excuse that "We are experiencing long queue yada yada". After picking the printers department and waiting for a while the phone system said "We have a faster moving line, if you speak english, press x". Since English is not a problem, I went there.
 A lady picks up, listens to my problem and says she can't help because they don't deal with printers (red flag #2). Wants to give me a long phone number (unrecognizable to me) and refuses to say which country it belongs to, so how can I use it? (red flag #3)
 Realizing she has no idea where I'm calling from, I explain how I reached there, including the fact that I speak 2 languages, to which she says "Wow, you're so talented!". This is the part that I'm still laughing about.
 The whole conversation was weird, little bit condescending and silly. To me this is all kind of hilarious because I didn't expect anything better than this when calling HP 😂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to create a captive portal with different restriction per user account/role (student and teacher). 
  
The Teacher can have unrestricted access.
 The Student have restricted access. (only defined/allowed websites are accessible).
  
But upon my research/review on OpnSense Captive Portal Documentation, This is not possible because you can only configure firewall/captive portal settings per port/interface. In short, 1 Zone is 1 Interface.
 I cannot modify the infrastructure/wiring or add another Wi-Fi access points since It's already installed and running. I can only configure them.
 So my plan is: 
  
Setup 2 VLAN ID's (Interface) on a single physical ethernet port on OpnSense that is connected to the Wifi Access Points.
 Create two Captive Portals on OpnSense that uses the 2 VLAN Interface I created.
 Configure the Wifi Access Points to two SSID's (Teacher Wifi & Student WiFi) and attach each SSID to specific VLAN ID I setup on OpnSense.
 Configure OpnSense Website Filtering on the Student Wifi VLAN Interface.
  
To be honest, these are just my theories. I don't really know if this is a feasible or good workaround/setup. This is my first time in network setup/engineering. Please bear with me.
 All I want to know is, Is this kind of setup possible Please give me some tips/suggestions on how I can do it better. Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody,
 I can't figure out why some signed official binaries downloaded from internet are blocked by SmartScreen (with no possibility to force approval). For example,
 - if i download "ConEmu" from the official website, the binary has a valid certificate chain where the root CA is in the trusted roots of the computer. This prompts the Smartscreen. If i "unblock" the file from properties i can run it.
 - i download "notepad++" from the official website as well, valid certificate chain with trusted root. This doesn't prompt smartscreen, directly UAC...
 Can someone explain this behavior ? I could see that the trigger of smartscreen is the "zone identifier" of the executable, but as told in the example, both of these were downloaded from the internet... 
 Also, how can i check the zone identifier of an executable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Community, since we get more and more home office devices, which only need to have a vpn client and connect over rds, we decided to not join these devices into our domain, since they are only used from outside our network. At first i checked them frequently manually, there are too much devices for this.
 Now i am searching for a small software, i would love to have a portal to see which devices are out of date. Priority is for windows updates and upgrades, third party software would be a bonus.
 Do you have any suggestions for me? The devices just have a connection to 4 terminal server, so the communication needs to be done over the normal internet.
 Im excited to hear about your opinions.

Basicly there is a running yaml config of application and it can be modified from an API directly plus it can be configured through helm with templating. So at the deploy/upgrade of helm we have one running yaml config and yaml config from helm which may have additions and chanages to existing config. What is the best way do dynamically merge two giving precedence to running config? main point is being generic/dynamic but not going over each possible config array.

The teams message notification sound rings a billion times a day and my personal phone is being called by random employees who somehow has my number. Even when i have lunch, i lock my office door yet people are trying to rip off the handle it seems like to get inside. 
 Right now i have 4 huge problems i'm trying to fix at once because they're all urgent last call things they need by the end of the week. One with fiber infrastructure, one with a cisco switch being unstable, one with Vmware and one with a WDS Server. They're all problems that requires a somewhat lenghty amount of troubleshooting and configuration. 
 I'm trying my best but these people constantly send me passive aggressive messages asking when it's done and why it's not working. I'm trying my fucking best and i just want to scream. I'm currently so fucking overloaded by anxiety i just shut down and i'm now in the server room to just get a moment of peace. I still feel my phone vibrate and my heart jumps everytime it does. 
 Please remove this if it's not within the rules to post, but i just needed someone to vent to. I have a job interview next week and that job has ZERO user support. So i hope i can get away from this shithole ASAP.

PRTG - For monitoring WAN uptime, typical Windows sensors, etc.
 Cradlepoint - For LTE backup Internet 
 Rubrik - Data protection of Azure and M365 workloads
 Proofpoint - Email security
 Intune - MDM for corporate devices
 Microsoft Defender - EDR
 Zendesk - Ticketing
 ForitManager/Analyser - Central manage of Fortigate stacks of each location
  
All of these products provide API's that I should be able to grab data from and display on a dashboard.
 My goal is to create PowerBI Dashboards for the data points I want to display from the list of products above. I want to be able to visual these dashboards from my mobile via the PowerBi app as well as setting up wallboards in our IT area of the office.
 Is this realistically achievable, all from PowerBI? My issue is that I have never successfully been able to display a single piece of data via a API. I have tried, but always fail.
 Are there other that have similar IT dashboards setups as I described?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am trying to make a decision based on the fact that i am so over tech support right now
 I am currently a junior sysadmin with experience in PowerShell scripting and very basic programming knowledge in website development. Lately, I have been contemplating a career move to become a software developer. I am looking for advice on whether this move is worth it and what skills or experience I should have to make it happen.
 I have enjoyed my time as a sysadmin, but I am looking for a career that is more fulfilling and flexible. My main goal is to start a business one day as soon as possible, and I am wondering which career path will be more advantageous in this regard. I am starting to enjoy building things, and I am concerned that being a sysadmin will mostly be a tech support role until I get into management. I also can't see how any sysadmin skills will help in business/side hustles until it gets bit enough to need storage and automation. Whereas i feel like building small apps and implementations is possible to do on the side at least if i was to understand development
 I was considering doing a 6 – 10 month bootcamp to help transition, but am also considering other options. What are the key differences between being a sysadmin and a software developer? And most importantly, which career path will be more beneficial for starting a business or work for myself in the future, sysadmin/devops route or software development?
 Lastly, holding me back from making this move is that I have recently landed a role as a lone systems admin and have okay money now (90k AUD) and am enjoying 20% of the work (building/scripting things) and the title. Does it get much better? I am worried about losing the stability and the title of my current role, but I also know that sys admin skills aren’t really transferable to many starting out businesses and side hustles.
 I appreciate any advice or insight. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a remote site that is connected to my DC via a Juniper SRX firewall that's establishing a site-to-site tunnel to another SRX in the DC. The remote site is on a cable internet circuit. At all my sites, including the remote site, 802.1X with EAP-TLS is used for both wireless and wired auth. This has been working great for months, until my ISP changed which backbone on their network my DIA connection runs across. No other changes were made anywhere other than the provider's backbone that's delivering the DIA circuit.
 The IP address of the SRX in the DC didn't change and the tunnel is still up and working. I can't find any evidence of issues with the tunnel, except .1X doesn't work anymore. On the NPS servers in the DC, event viewer shows that auth requests are coming in from the switch and AP at the remote site, but it almost seems like the .1X requests are getting mangled across the site-to-site tunnel. The same NPS servers service .1X for hardwired and wireless clients across several other sites connected via the ISP's MPLS without issue.
 Event viewer shows that auth requests from the AP at the remote site get logged as event id 6274 "The RADIUS Request message that Network Policy Server received from the network access server was malformed." Auth requests from hardwired ports from the remote switch show that rather than the computer name with a certificate, the request shows the client trying to auth with its mac address as the username and PAP and summarily denied.
 A tech at the ISP that made the backbone change and I have been beating our heads against the wall for a few days now with no progress. I've resorted to installing wireshark on the NPS server to try to find differences between known-good auth packets and broken packets, but haven't found an obvious difference yet. Would anyone happen to know how a seemingly innocuous change could bork .1X in such a bizarre way?

 We often have to send huge files internationally, which can easily saturate a 20G circuit. Should I be worried that the carrier's backbone is Nx10G? Would something like traffic arriving out of order due to asymmetric routing be a potential issue?
 What kind of questions should I be asking them before we pull the trigger? I have full access to their network engineering team but I'm finding it hard to articulate my questions so that I don't receive bullshit answers.

 I have a network history lab that I am trying to bootstrap and I am needing to activate some Optera gear (5100 in particular).
 I worked with the Optera platforms in the early days but I cannot locate my PDFs or software archives for them.
 I know that Optera IP went to Ciena - but I had moved out of optical by that point - so I don't have a relationship with them.
 I am hoping that being many years out of date - some of this would be available without too much fuss. 
 This is a completely non-commercial exercise - just trying to restore some items from my past as a hobby (I have the hardware, just no software/docs).
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, R2D2 can be seen plugging in to download additional plans to the Death Star. One sees R2D2 in the screen for approximately 80 seconds before we see him again in frame, disconnected from the terminal. I contend R2D2’s dongle is capable of yottabit speed.
 The hard drive used to store the plans allegedly held 512 million exanodes of space, as depicted in Star Wars Rogue One. This would therefore be 512 yotta nodes if one follows the metric naming convention for numerical prefixes.
 General (poor) assumptions: (1) R2D2 spent all 80 seconds downloading the plans to the Death Star (2) the plans to the Death Star and its build history downloaded filled up the drive (3) a bit is equivalent to a node (4) no q-bit fuckery is afoot and (5) the plans are uncompressed.
 512/80 is 6.4 yottabit/second throughput.

 When client connects using OpenVpn the OpenVpn conection says its reaching to the outside Untangle firewall IP with port 1194 without any errors. 
 Then when the client opens their application an error comes up with the IP:8081/Server which is the server,port,share that is open for that application.
 I dont know if this is correct but I made a Port Foward rule form OpenVpn port 1194 to forward to the internalIP:8081 (ServerApplication)
 Am I configuring this correctly or how do I go about it? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Within the last couple of days I had setup a DFS Namespace on a domain controller and DFS Replication to replicate a shared folder from one file server to another. During the course of that initial replication copy, there was a root folder on the same drive where the shared folder was being replicated to and that root folder is now gone. Backups were not in production at the time as the server was still being configured. Replication only went one direction (Old Server to New Server) for one folder and its sub folders (IE D:\SharedFolder\FolderShares1-6 and User Redirected Folders). this was done as a form of migration of the file servers. 
 Now that the folder is gone, I am wondering why would DFS remove that folder if it was not part of the replication. I am also now running into issues where users are denied access to their User Redirected Folders, which still reside on the old File server and are managed via GPO.

I got off a call today with our ISP (A very well known massive cable/internet/phone provider, but not comcast) where they casually mentioned (after we threatened to go in house) that we must use their managed Wi-Fi MDU solution, they wont just give us an internet pipe for us to do it in-house. 
 They said the Business or Enterprise divisions will not give us a connection for residential use and if they see that we're trying to use it for our residents they will cut us off.
 There's literally no other ISP that services the area except for T1 DSL or Starlink business. 
 Does this make any sense? They're essentially forcing us to use their managed service which we hate and want to get rid of. 
 How can this be legal? What about all those news stories of some people in neighborhoods becoming their own ISP by buying a business class modem and then re-selling it with some kind of mesh system to the neighbors?

 There’s been a few red flags (100s of dormant AD accounts, Azure servers running but not used for anything, etc) all minor things I could chalk up to unintentional or old MSP shenanigans. One frustration mentioned when I started is the migration from the previous MSP is only now being wrapped up by the new MSP, a year later. All these things I again can chalk up to scheduling, waiting for resources, etc. 
 What I do need a sanity check on is the slowness of response for requests of 1) documentation and network diagrams, 2) quotes for new projects, and 3) a lack of interest in consolidating/disabling portions of Azure infrastructure.
 For example, I requested a rough estimate for five projects 8 business days ago. By no means detailed SoWs, just a rough number for budget setting. Or waited nearly three weeks for documentation and still no response beyond confirmation of receipt.
 Is this type of non-responsiveness expected? What is considered a quick turn-around for these types of requests? Feel like I’m going crazy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow sysadmins,
 Our organization relies heavily on Microsoft Word VBA Macros to generate and live-edit Word documents. They were hand-made about 15 years ago, and the original authors are gone. Our sysadmins can maintain with minor edits as needed, but aren't really tasked for making new, complex workflows should the need arise.
 In googling, I found that Microsoft released "Office Scripts" in 2020. By "Office Scripts", Microsoft really meant, "Excel Online Scripts". Have not seen any indication of scripting being extended into Word.
 Is there any successor, alternative, or replacement to Word VBA Macros? Seems kind of weird for a technology from 1993 to have no replacement 30 years later.
 Thanks for any insight you may have.

My admin is gung-ho about physically moving drops from punch to punch when certain people move to a different desk within the one building in the company, and re-punching is uncomfortable to say the least, painful normally.
 So my question is it normal to move drops to different panels so that they can be plugged into another switch? This happens a fair amount (including, "condensing the drop") and I thought to ask.
 Thanks!

 Which is why I chose to initiate this thread in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently took over running a medical facility. The clinic and providers are great but every other part of the business is set up terribly. I've been going through it piece by piece working on fixing it. Trust me when I say my predecessor was a complete moron.
 My most recent discovery is that we are paying $865 a month (before taxes and fees) for our copy machine (only one) that only sees moderate use. It took me days and about a dozen calls and I finally got ahold of my account rep and the explanation is my predecessor continued to roll over their lease agreement about 2 years early over and over and we have been with them for 30 years so the previous amount due was also rolled over.
 The summary is that we pay almost 1,000 a month for the next 63 months (the contract was signed only a few months ago). To break it we would have to pay over $55,000 for a copier machine that would cost about $8,000 to buy.
 ​
 If anyone has any advice or experience with this kind of situation any input would help. 
 Again reminder I did not sign this contract!! This is just one of many insane contracts signed here by my moronic predecessor. I always read the fine print.

 I just added 192.168.15.2 to the scope of the DHCP just now hoping that will fix it.

 When I log into the OpenVPN RV260, I can't see anything on the network, why?
 The RV260 and RV325 are not compatible for site-to-site VPN, otherwise I would do it and remove the RV325 completely and this problem will go away. Howeverm I can't do that, so there has to be a fix for this. 
 ​
 Why when I log into the OpenVPN server on the RV260, I can't see any network devices? I can only ping devices with the Gateway of the router I am connected too.

 This is bothering the crap out of me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 Im hoping someone might be able to help me figure out an issue I am having configuring a Cisco switch.
 ​
 So, first, I am not Cisco certified and overall have very little experience configuring Cisco switches. 
 ​
 The issue that I am running into is kind of strange. I am not able to get to my firewall from one of my VLANS.
 ​
 My test environment is like this
 ​
 ​
 Switch 1 (core switch) 192.168.0.10
 Switch 2 (access switch) 192.168.0.11
 Switch 3 (access switch) 192.168.0.12
 Firewall 192.168.0.6
 ​
 PC1 192.168.0.100
 PC2 192.168.0.110
 PC3 192.168.3.110
 ​
 I can ping everything from both PC1, PC2 and the Core switch. 
 I can ping both PC1 and PC2 and the core switch from PC3, however, I cannot ping both access switches and the firewall from PC3.
 ​
 I have an SVI configured with the IP address 192.168.3.1 on VLAN 30 on my Core switch. 
 I have a computer plugged directly into port 4 on the Core switch, but I cannot ping firewall. 
 ​
 I have been reading article after article and I know I have to be missing something stupid here. 
 ​
 I thought maybe it was because I didn't have layer 3 enabled, so as a test, I even configured port 4 with the IP address 192.168.3.1 and enabled routing, but I still get the exact same results.
 ​
 I have a static route setup for 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 to forward traffic to 192.168.0.6 (firewall).
 I am able to get out to the internet from both PC1 and PC2 just fine, just not PC3.
 ​
 Furthermore, if I log into my switches web portal, I can switch to VLAN30 and I can ping out directly from the switch, but I still cannot ping either access switch or the firewall from the Core switch on VLAN30
 ​
 ​
 Any help would be so very gratefully appreciated. 
 Thank you so much in advance!
 Edit: Solved!

 I'm currently tasked with deploying a modest data center, and I'm looking for some recommendations on software to create network rack diagrams that include cabling and airflow.
 I'd like to create professional-looking diagrams that accurately reflect the constraints of our data center, and I'm hoping to get some input from the community on the best tools for the job. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out in the field, I'd love to hear what software you use and why you prefer it.
 Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions!

 I am wondering if anyone can give me any suggestions here. I have traffic coming into let's say VLAN10, hitting a firewall (I see this being passed), exiting via VLAN20, hitting the VLAN interface on ACI, and then not hitting the actual gateway of the destination subnet. 
 In a working traceroute I see: VLAN10 >> Firewall (static route out) >> ACI VLAN20 Interface >> Dest. Subnet Gateway >> Destination IP.
 Not working: VLAN10 >> Firewall (static route out) >> ACI VLAN20 Interface >> Timeout 
 Does anyone have any suggestions as to what can I check here? I am not very familiar with ACI. (The source is the same core router, different l3 vlans all taking the same path).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We currently control our L3 in our at&t’s avpn offering. We have gre (mGRE) tunnels and bgp feeding various services via afi to various sites. Some sites even have various other types of encryption. From my understanding, typically the site rtr does NOT have MPLS config, though we still have MPLS qos config on each site rtr, along with the hub having MPLS qos config. Our hub feeds into another MPLS network we own - after collectors - so I’d presume, if the marking is kept, that it could be used for our campus MPLS qos (I think that’s the teams thought here). However, peeling back the onion, it was revealed to me by AT&T, that each site doesnt necessarily have a COS profile ordered with them , which would explain some of the asymmetrical issues seen while traffic went through AVPN - maybe. My question is, if we are hopping around at layer 3 already, would MPLS markings still be seen or matter by AT&Ts underlay somewhere? Even with just the basic GRE traffic, I’d figure that qos markings would be copied over maintained? Right now, I think the profile not being set as being the problem / waste.
 At a higher level to this, it seems like there’s a possibility that whoever architected the design so that we control L3, traded off the QoS perk gained from MPLS. Hopefully not.

We are looking into VLANS to help alleviate our available IP issue, but as a quick fix to more immediately alleviate this issue.. Could we go to /22 and can we specify the next subnet? i.e. could we do 192.168.21.0/22 or does it have to be 192.168.3.0/22 (do the subnets need to increase incrementally or can they be manually defined)?
 We don't want to use subnet 3 because we have a site in our WAN that currently uses 192.168.3.0/24

 I had some recent network speed issues so I pulled out my trusty iperf3 to try and diagnose and I found something I am hoping you can help me with. I have a server in my office and other in my basement, about 75 feet of cable run between them. When I run iperf3 as the server on my basement linux (fedora) server and the client on my laptop I see lots (200,000+) of retr (retransmits). But when I do the reverse where the iperf3 server is in my office and the client is in the basement, I get few to no retr. This is very consistent, lots of retr going in one direction (office to basement) but few going the other way (basement to office). I have also run iperf3 server and client both on servers in my basement using the same switch as basement to office and that’s also pretty clean, few if any retr. 
 Does this point to a bad cable? Bad switch? Bad ends on the cables? What would you do to diagnose and clear this up?
 Thanks in advance for your wisdom and guidance!

But not everyone is affected and they are rarely the same issues across users.
 Just wondering if it's just our org or if MS has changed anything behind the scenes without checking if their apps still work afterwards (again...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I would like to setting up the SSSO to my organization but I don't know if it secure enough. I have an hybrid environment but without Azure AD-joined devices, my devices only joined to the on-premise AD. I followed the Microsoft documentation and I configured everything: Azure AD Connect, GPO and the Firewall. It is working very well with my test users. 
 My settings in a nutshell:
 Azure AD
  
Password hash sync
  
GPO (from Microsoft documentation)
  
Site to Zone Assignment List
 Allow updates to status bar via script
 SPNEGO (Firefox)
  
AZUREADSSO Computer Object on my on-premise AD
  
Storing object in OU where is securing against accidental deletion
 msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute set to AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
 Kerberos delegation is disabled on this object 
  
According to Microsoft documentation it is recommended to update the Kerberos decryption key at least on every 30 day.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso-faq#how-can-i-roll-over-the-kerberos-decryption-key-of-the--azureadsso--computer-account-
 I have not found anything about SSSO on the internet from a security perspective. Can cybercriminals exploit this SSSO capability or is it safe enough? I am wondering about on this because SSSO sends Kerberos ticket over the internet. I don't know if I should worry about that. Maybe I just overthinking.
 Does anyone have experience with Seamless Single Sign-On? Can you share your experience with me?
 Is there anything else I should be aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/sysadmin
 I'm curious how you all go about testing your backups? We have a medium/large sized environment with ~1000 VMs and a few physical servers (most SQL boxes) that we are backing up regularly. 98% Windows, a very select few Linux. However, we don't have a definitive process for testing these backups beyond requested restores that we have to do as people need them.
 Previously, I used Veeam's SureBackup feature to test backups at my previous job, but here we use Commvault and I don't see a similar feature. There does seem to be some sort of backup validation but Commvault's documentation doesn't match what I'm seeing in our console.
 Using Veeam's SureBackup as a model, I started to build out a sandbox network that would mirror our production network, which I could restore VMs into and then run scripts against them to verify they are working. The point I'm more or less stuck at is the "scripts to verify they are working" part. For basic Windows boxes I've got a script that checks for running services, and for all the VMs I'm pulling their reported heartbeat status by VMWare, but this is imperfect and doesn't cover some of our more specialized boxes like Exchange or SQL databases. 
 Somewhere along the line I think there will be a human element (IE, you are the admin for this server, your server is currently in the sandbox network, login to it and make sure everything works before it gets torn down) but I'd like to automate as much of this process as possible.
 What approach do you take? Is there a feature in Commvault I've missed or a third party tool that solves the problem? Or do you have better ideas on what to check using various scripts and the like?

 Hi,
 I need to add an AD group to the ACL of thousands of folders, which all have different permissions and inheritance settings. All the folders are subfolders of drive D
 I need all the permissions to stay the same, just one group added with full access. I wrote a powershell script for this. 
 Is this the right approach? do you see anything wrong with this?
 $identity = 'domain\group' $rights = 'FullControl' $inheritance = 'ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit' $propagation = 'None' $type = 'Allow' $ACE = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule($identity, $rights, $inheritance, $propagation, $type) Get-ChildItem D: -Recurse -Directory | ForEach-Object{ $acl = get-acl -Path $_.FullName $acl.AddAccessRule($ACE) Set-Acl -Path $_.FullName -AclObject $acl }

 So I've been trying to think about my career in a 10-15 or maybe 15-20 year span. I know it's a controversial idea, but I look at the developments in the space and satellite industry and can't help but see this era as the verge of a massive breakout of space infrastructure. 
 So that got me thinking, what does an IT infrastructure look like to a space faring civilization when there are regular trips to a lunar colony? How would you deploy software to an MECM distribution point on the moon? How would you handle a Domain Controller in deep space?
 I've tried looking for early research on this idea without much success. Does anybody know of any reading material on the subject? Or possibly any writings on interfacing with a remote site that has unreliable or inconsistent communication times?

 So, i have a TP Link EC230-G1 that my friend gave to me, and it worked perfectly, except it wont give internet access to IPV6, while IPV4 does give internet, while it doesnt matter much to me but it kinda bothers me. Initially i tought this might be a DHCP conflict, so i assigned a slight difference of IPV6 address (like it ended with 9F i change it with 8F) to my Router (set as static ipv6 address), it does change, but then it would still not work, im at a loss of any solution here. My main GPON Router is Huawei HG8245H5.
 I really hope there is a solution to this problem :D

 The reason we go with SAAS providers is they will have 1000 times better DR than we could afford but I find we are being asked to provide a DR plan for our business and am finding it difficult to articulate this.

 My first idea was OSPF but I don't know if I can have two completely disjunct areas. EIGRP is not an option as there are non-Cisco devices involved. 
 Any idea what would be my best option here?

 Is anyone familiar with Huawei devices in general, or does anyone know what devices support netconf and how to configure it?

I struggle maintaining enough of a focus to keep at it, and also notice that my retention is pretty abysmal. Case in point, these days I'm trying to shove a lot of MS' Power Platform-skills into my head, since I'll be working a lot on that due to a move to Dynamics 36 that we're currently underway on.

 Kind of odd question but I hope someone can help me understand it.. as far as I know, IGEL reworked their license model recently and I'm not sure if it still works for our planned enviroment.
 We have around 10-15 Thin Clients, mostly in warehouses where it's rather dirty and since we swapped out most office PCs in 2021, I have a bunchload of old systems that I want to rework into TCs to replace our current "infrastructure" which consists mostly of 7-10 year old actual thin clients with a self-"constructed" Linux version. Latter one wasn't documented at all by it's creator who hase left us in the meantime.
 So around the middle of 2022 I got 4 IGEL licenses to test and that worked pretty fine so far, we decided for the UDP / USB-Version and had no problems occur and the remote assistence etc. helped a lot. I had to put the topic aside for a while now due to other more urgend topics and since we lack staff right now. 
 I read somewhere that IGEL reworked their license modell and it's no longer "Buy once, get 1 year of support and that's it. More support costs but you can use the thin client without support". Considering the rather dirty enviroment and that our current "Solution" produces no monthly/yearly cost (except a device fails after years of usage) I doubt that I'll get the OK for a yearly subscription model.
 So could someone break down the new system or if I understood it wrong and my planned system/setup would still work?

 ​
 I'm writing to you because I can't figure out this odd behavior:
 We changed the IIS server's timeout setting from 90 seconds to 250 seconds.
 The appliance is placed on the back of an Azure LB with a 240-second timeout.
 Since the change, we have observed numerous transation timeouts where none had previously been reported.
 When the previous settings have been restored, everything was back to normal.
 Do you know why this peculiar behavior is occurring?
 ​
 Thanks

By default (i.e no SIEMs, no IDS, no firewall), how much info does a windows server log about any devices that connect to it? More specifically, is it possible for me to find which devices connected to it within a certain hour last week?
 Specifically the machine in question is a mail server running mdaemon. Someone sent an email from the organization's account with stolen credentials. We are trying to find the IP (and any other info if possible) for whoever connected to it. If windows server logs the IPs of all incoming requests, then it should be trivial to cross reference those requests with timestamp on the email right?

 Consider a L3 leaf switch with 2 trunk ports. They serve different tenants I want to keep isolated. Eth1 connects to a baremetal server owned by A, Eth2 connects to a bare metal server owned by tenant B.
 Furthermore, each tenant wants to create their own self-service isolated networks for their VMs/Docker containers. Or they could just go and configure a vanilla Linux VLAN interface on their box to send their own VLAN tagged traffic on an arbitrary subnet. I don't want to restrict this...
 Now normally I'd say A gets X vlans, B gets Y vlans, these are your subnets. But there aren't enough VLANs to go by, also, I don't want to restrict it to one server... I want the same L2 domain no matter which rack or switch the server…]]></summary>

 PowerChute gives us the notification that the UPS connection is not established via our Monitoring. We have tried everything so far. Reinstalling the Software, Replugging the UPS (which sometimes works), Rebooting the OS and so on. Nothing really helps.
 ​
 I know the UPS is connected to the server. If I uninstall the APC UPS Driver, then the UPS gets detected by Windows and the battery symbol appears in the taskbar.
 ​
 Doesnt matter what Windows Server it is. The problem happens on any of our Servers. Randomly I would say. Its really frustrating because you cant seem to fix it remotely.I dont wanna go on site to check the UPSes myself. Not with 100 clients.
 ​
 Anyone else having that issue? Or maybe someone has found a fix?

I plan to use git to save my work in a repo within a branch having a name "common" for common things and another branch with name of that of the company I am working for, and to which the laptop belongs, where I will save/commit company specific stuff.
 I see that I am spending a lot of my free time in customizing things. Shell variables, aliases, bash functions, writing scripts to help me login to different envs (Azure, AWS, local Servers etc) easily. Aliases to execute frequent long commands. Functions to execute commands with parameters.
 Wanted to understand, that since this is the beginning for me to customize my env for myself, is it Okay to spend a considerable amount of time in the process? I am hoping that my current way of customizing will help me in future companies also, where I can clone this repo, switch to an old companies branch, take what should be taken from common (probably all), and then create a new branch with the new company name and add that company specific stuff there.
 Will doing things this way, which would make things heavily customized in the future, and might need some maintainence overhead too, is a good idea? Or is there a better way?

 I have engagement (tehe) with a vendor on a project recently. They provide SaaS for my company. We are trying to stand up a new site to site. Problem is we don't see the tunnel (policy based) come up. My next steps were to do an embedded pcap as I am not seeing any traffic from the host at the firewall. I send an email to the vendor saying I see no traffic each time we test... but then after I explicitly point at the host in one of my emails we see an icmp request come across the fw about an hour later. Following I get an email from their pm asking me to explain steps I see in the network and they are requesting an additional resource to look at our network. 
 Now the question. And don't get me wrong, this is indeed ego related, but my ego isnt that big (is it?). 
 Previously when setting up the site to site, I worked with a respectable sounding network engineer. Would it be wrong to reach out to him and ask him what the hell? (Respectfully.) The problem is that the traffic never leaves the host. We have routes out and they proved it via ping. 
 TLDR: I want to hear about times that you all took back alleys to get things accomplished. Or do we all just play the follow along and provide pcap when requested?

Every day around the same time, one of our sites' (public high school) bandwidth drops to nothing for about 15 minutes. I ran iperf tests on repeat and logged the output across the WAN to the site and I was getting around 1.8Gbits/s on a 2Gbits/s connection. Right around the time the students leave the bandwidth tanked in iperf (just across the WAN to the DC) and on speedtest.net to 30Mbits/s for between 5 and 15 minutes. Seems to happen each day around that time and then just clears up.
 I have smokeping running and that looks clean and never shows a change. I don't drop regular ping packets but if I run a faster fping I do see between 1%-4% packet loss around that time. Interfaces on my router are clear. Nothing in the logs of the routers on either side. Something tells me it's the WAN provider but I am out of ideas on what to test or how to prove the issue further. I plan on reaching out to them tomorrow to see if they can seen anything on their side but I know that will be tough to get them to research it. Any recommendations on what else to try and test?
 TIA!

 Career wisdom for sysadmins, compliments of HouseCravenRaw: 
  
Irreplaceable is unpromotable
 Documentation is king
 Know your exits (rollback plan, etc.)
 Always get a CYA
 Toot your own horn—modesty doesn't make money
 ‘No’ is a complete sentence
 Stability is paramount—don't aim for newest or best, aim for reliable and dependable
 Cattle, not pets
 Make sure your cattle are self-minding—the less fiddling and doting and button-pressing you need to do, the better
 Make your own roadmap, be it your career or your department, have a direction and test it
 When you do a thing, understand why you are doing it. Google might give you an answer, but it doesn't give you comprehension. Running a StackOverflow solution without understanding what's going on will only lead to more problems in the future
 Don't stay in one place too long
 Test your parachute, be it a tape backup or a rollback plan or a snapshot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm in the process of replacing the firewalls at our main site as well as our DR site and had a question as to what the best way to setup SSL VPN connections for our users would be. The current setup is non-existent in that my predecessor never did any SSL VPN config on the DR firewall (I don't know how they thought that was going to work in a disaster).
 Each site is going to have a pair of Palo Alto 3410s in active/passive HA. I'd like to try to avoid having to setup each user with 2 different SSL VPN configs (one for normal use and one for DR use) and the only way of doing this that comes to mind immediately would be for me to have a virtual firewall in the cloud that I use to terminate all of the client SSL VPN connections to and then have a site to site VPN between that firewall and both the production site and the DR site. With that setup, in a DR scenario I wouldn't have to touch the SSL VPN config, just route the traffic from the virtual firewall to the DR site rather than the main site. Obviously this would require extra licensing for the virtual firewall and increases complexity but I'm thinking it might be worth it to not have to setup every user with multiple SSL VPN configs and explain to them to use the DR one in a DR scenario.
 I don't have much experience with SSL VPN configs on Palo Alto firewalls yet, so if there is an easier or more efficient way to achieve this please feel free to suggest. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says, I've got upper management claiming they need to be global admins, user admins, etc. 
 Before I was hired they were basically just winging it for managing their MS365 environment and giving anybody that needed any level of admin full blown global admin privileges. Now that I have started that isn't going to fly and I am going through and taking away privileges. The issue is I have multiple people claiming they need admin permissions but judging by how things were done before I got here I am very hesitant to let anyone keep their privileges. I am leaning towards just taking the access away and see how long it takes for them to even notice but I would also like to have some data as to why I made that decision other than telling the CFO I don't trust him to have admin privileges.
 Is there a report I can run showing the login history for the admin portals specifically? IE - I took your privileges away because you haven't even logged into the admin portal since 2021.

Here is the story and I'm hoping you fine folks can point me in the right direction. Have put our Firewall on the FY 23' replacement radar so I've seen demo's from a few vendors on their product, all vendors had our requirements beforehand on what I am looking for in a FW. We are not married to the big 'C' so I have ventured out to the competition and for the most part I have liked Fortinet and Checkpoint. I have invited all engineers in my department who have worked with our current FW and may administer the next solution (disappointingly they rarely showed up to the the Demo's). So now that I have spoken with the vendors of interest whats next? Do I make a decision based on what I've seen? Do I gather the team and ask, "Okay who should be continue to speak with in the next phase". We can't take demo's because I work for a Govt agency and its a against company policy, but I want to make the best decision possible that will benefit the organization. Can someone help me understand where I go from here?

 I have a grown /24 network I have to manage at our company because our networking colleague left the company...
 All adresses are used and therefore some colleagues get no ip address at all - as expected. 
 Now I don't really know how to professionally create a solution. First approach was to create a new /22 network but I read something about problems due to the Broadcast overhead with this many clients in a Single subnet.
 Currently I consider a multi-subnet network for our lan and wifi. But I simply don't know how to design this to avoid any problems in the future. 
 LAN ports can be assigned to the subnet, maybe one /24 per floor.
 My question is: How do I setup our wifi in the building? We currently have one SSID and I would like to keep this. How do I split this up? Same SSID with different subnets?
 Thank you for your input!

 There are a lot of jobs out there, many listings, and with the advent of remote/WFH the markets you can work in have substantially increased. This naturally results in an increased number of job opportunities for each of us to apply to or be considered for.
 So my advice, waste less of your time, less time of the recruiter, and get actually useful information up-front.

I texted back that those days are important, I didn't want them to burn out, and I'd see them tomorrow. I hope they have a relaxing day playing video games or gardening or whatever they do to destress.
 Later in the day another guy was more or less reduced to tears after an encounter with an end-user. An hour later they were still visible shaken. I told him to take the rest of the day off, fully paid. Then I went and had a talk with the end-user and told them that their department and IT should be on the same team. I can't have my people effectively helping him if he views us as the enemy and my team is scared to go help.
 Will we maybe have a larger load for the 8 of us left here today? Probably. Is it worth it so my people aren't burnt out and leaving and we have to hire new people? Yes, 100x over.
 If you're in a burnout situation, don't let your company/MSP gaslight you into believing that all IT jobs are like that or that all managers/directors are like that. Pay for a resume refresh, apply for other jobs, find a place where you're respected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're deploying Opengears around the US and global for OOB. This will be major cities primarily but you never know (one of our datacenters is in the boonies of NJ, for example).
 I think the answer here is a global-roaming multi-carrier SIM. One vendor, all networks, don't have to pay attention to where we ship it. Ideally it lets us also choose whatever carrier has best signal instead of being locked to the carrier we bought the sim from.
 I was looking at Twiliio, and the platform is just super cool, but we're not large enough for them to be interested in giving us a better rate. So I'm looking around for other choices. If twilio is the only choice then I'll hold my nose and pay, but it's worth asking what else there is. 
 Let's figure a burn of around 15MB/day so around 500MB/unit/mo. Not huge, not zero. Bogey being here occasionally we may want to use it for backup IP for the site, in which case we'll be burning 10s of GBs. But maybe that's ok in the case since it will be an emergency. (We normally run dual ISPs for offices but not everywhere has decent alternatives etc.)
 No, I don't expect it to be free, I just also don't want to get bent over, so to speak.
 Who else plays in this space that is worth talking to?

 The call center voice router and server is behind the US sonicwall. 
 Users in Asia also have a per user L2TP VPN for wfh days.
 Here’s the issue: When Asia users are at the office (hence using the site to site VPN in Asia) they experience call drops and crazy packet loss on the calls.
 We know this because the voice router/server monitors the calls.
 When Asia users are at the office and turn on their L2TP VPN to call, the calls are perfect with less than 10% packet loss. 
 Why would users experience better call quality using an L2TP vpn behind the sonicwall rather than just the site to site? It’s also all the same equipment too (wfh vs office)
 I’ve tried MTR and trace routes but since I can’t see the route behind the VPN i haven’t been able to pin point the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/sysadmin, I'm /u/AutoModerator, and welcome to this month's Patch Megathread!
 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

 "Do I email you or [name of my CIO]? I have a lot of insight I want to share with you"
 Me or my boss? Well, that's easy, neither. You don't get to email anyone here any more.
 The email has been reported as spam. The email/domain have been blocked company wide. The phone number has been blocked in the pbx.
 Numerous Phone calls/voicemails from (xxx) xxx-xxxx "Hi, this is Nancy Adams, I need you to call me back when you get a chance. Thanks." Who the fuck is Nancy? Oh a random software company rep, oh...
 Blocked on PBX. Looked up company/domain/email, blocked on email, web filter. Left a solid yelp review indicating business marketing practices. I don't think this is vindictive, not any more than calling someone leaving them a message saying "Call me back!"
 Every stupid fucking idea is brought to you by a recent bs-chool graduate who feels they need to "apply" their newly learned knowledge of bullshit.
 Do I sound upset? I'm a little upset. I'm done with this level of bullshit. This is a good place to vent.
 Edit: Why am I jumbling the case of the letters? It's to indicate their level of L33tness.
 ​
 Edit2: I should add this comes on the heels of me actually calling one of the vendors back and saying we were not interested in their service at this time and in turn what they did is add me to a list and I received 12 phone calls from their competitors in 5 days. So I am NO LONGER calling anyone back. That is what I get for being a decent person.

Everything looks great, except they have 2 VDI thin clients machines. Is there any way to get them to work in a P2P network? They didn't give me information on them whenever we discussed the job; I'll be honest, VDI is not in my wheelhouse. Any tips would be GREATLY appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 We are trying to migrate our on prem Exchange 2016 server to 365, but appear to have hit a roadblock from initial assessment while working with our MSP and I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this issue?
 We have an on prem Exchange 2016, with Business Standard licenses in 365.
 For the last 2-3 years we have been creating user in AD, with sync to 365 and giving them a Business Standard license, which includes a Teams License, and Mailbox.
 The Mailbox doesn't get used in 365, but still gets added as part of enabling the license. We just route all our mail to the on prem instance and connect Outlook to local exchange.
 The Teams license however does get used for scheduling video calls, and also creating the odd group and channels.
 My understanding is that to do a hybrid migration (and enable it), you can't have existing mailboxes in the cloud and those mailboxes need to be deleted.
 I also understand that Teams stores all the chat data in the mailbox as well. 
 So do we need to purge all our existing Team Groups in 365, and chat data as well as - then enable hybrid migration - and re-create them to do our migration successfully? 
 We also use SharePoint, but I don't believe that will cause any problems to the exchange migration as far as I know.
 Thanks for your help/input.

I don't understand this move. People are mobile, work from home, have cell phones and all of these things use DHCP. How is anyone narrowing down whitelists?
 Where have the blacklist options gone? Why are we perpetually guessing what shifted today with these products?
 Most importantly, why are people scrambling to find and locate such basic things as inbound blocking/allowing? It's because we now need a Microsoft Defender license for this "Feature," which I feel is far too basic to be locked behind monetary incentive, and was never a paid for feature before this year.
 Its incredible how many times I have had to pull back the customer's expectations for what is possible and not, when even the lay person can use words like "block" but I can't without talking about cost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 An organization I am working for is looking to move away from their aging on-prem based sFTP server to a cloud based sharing platform with traditional sFTP support as well as a web based portal for easier customer access. 
 There are lots of file sharing / collaboration offerings out there but finding one with that is more or less a hosted service offering traditional sFTP client support along with web portal based access is proving difficult. 
 We have looked into Files / Egnyte. 
 Are there others that anyone can recommend that are similar to Files? Looking for a service that can scale starting small, maybe 60-70 customers and grow to 200+ with a predictable pricing model. Data usage is not a concern and will fall well below the capacity offerings of most of these services. 
 Anyways, open to suggestions as this seems a bit niche. 
 Thanks

 Sure, we could just pop them in Excel on a Teams/Sharepoint site but that seems too easy, are there any tools aimes at small businesses that will help is keep an asset inventory (hardware and software) or even a tool that exports (or integrates) with 365 that will let us view it in one place?
 Perhaps there's a section in Intune/MEM that does all this, but I can't seem to find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning all,
 Maybe I'm reading in to this far too much, but I've noticed a lot of resellers seem to get irate at the idea that I have multiple people quoting for the same thing. Even more so when I receive a lower quote from someone else.
 I was wondering if maybe I am doing something wrong here? I've never thought much about it. Don't see what's wrong about trying to get the cheapest deal I can? But for example, we are currently quoting for a new chunk of hardware, we our usual supplier but also have 2 other companies this time who have both offered it cheaper. We've let our usual supplier know and they seem to be offended that we didn't just blindly go with them? 
 Is it rude of me to give out their quotes for other people to try and match/best? I can't imagine this sort of thing happening outside of IT but maybe I'm wrong.

 TLS 1.2 was enabled both client and server keys as needed however after TLS 1.0 + 1.1 were disabled I couldnt RDP to the server (which is a domain controller). I was getting an NLA failure message - I do enforce NLA via GPO as its mandated by our cyber insurance coverage.
 I re-enabled TLS 1.1 and was able to resume normal operations on the server. Any ideas why this would break? The client (my laptop) has TLS 1.2 enabled, I cant understand why there is a reliance on TLS 1.1.

 Im essentially trying to configure a Syslog-Server with a Webinterface running on an Apache2 Webserver.
 I messed around a bit on my Raspberry PI4, and am now trying to replicate this on a VM at work. However im already failing at accessing the default page of the webserver.
 On my Raspberry PI and at home, all i had to do was install the server, and allow communication through my UFW. After that, i could reach the Default Page via my Raspberrys IP-Adress in my Browser. I assume it tried reaching the server on Port 80 by default.
 This however doesnt work on my VM. Firewall is active, the webserver can accept packages on port 80 and 443. However i cant even ping the VM from inside my network.
 Any ideas?

These are currently all standalone with no domain, so each one doesn't really have a consistent set of local firewall settings, local security policies etc. As I'm going to be hardening these in-line with the Security Centre recommendations, I'm thinking to add either a couple of DCs or Azure Active Directory Domain Services to the deployment, then domain-join the VMs so I can use Group Policy and standardize them all. Is this still the best approach, or is there a cloud-native agent that would let me achieve the same? Intune is out as these are all server OSes.

 I googled it and it says the client tries to connect via https but I don't get why. There is no https invloved. When I connect to the URL through the current proxy (that is to be replaced) my browser shows that the connection is not secure as it just http.
 Any idea why it's trying https?

 We have 100-150 projects a year, they have from a few Gigabytes up to 150-200GB of files associated to them. Most of them are images and binaries.
 I'd like to set up a centralized file storage for these projects. I'd like it to be easy to access, easy to admin and easy to back up. We have Microsoft 365 basic (and standard for some users). I'd prefer a cloud based solution because I don't trust our network and I'm not touching that yet because I already own plenty of our infrastructure...
 Users are somewhat tech savvy but I'd prefer to have something that's easy to set up and organize.
 Any suggestions are welcome!

 As far as I understand this, Teams is working like this:
 - Call between two people on the same network: Media traffic goes P2P
 - Call between two people not on the same network: All the media traffic goes through Microsoft servers
 - Call between multiple persons inside and outside the network: All the media traffic goes through Microsoft servers
 The last scenario is where they experience the problems – especially, when the number of internal people in the meeting is high, as every Teams client seems to up- and download all the media traffic.
 Have you experienced the same? Is there anything you can do about it? How do really large companies handle it, when they have like hundreds of people joining a Teams meeting for trainings of stuff like that?

 I'm currently in the process of finding a digital signage solution for our business. Specifically, I'm looking for a solution that can display both websites and PowerPoint presentations and is remotely manageable.
 I'd like to setup 2 bigger touchscreens in the lobby. Visitors should be able to use the touchscreen to navigate through our website as well as display promotional materials such as PowerPoint slides. The player should have WiFi because cabling is a bit difficult.
 Does anyone have experience with a digital signage solution that fits these criteria? Any recommendations or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 I have looked into Yodeck, Xibo and Posterbooking and Samsungs MagicInfo CMS solution. Tending to use Posterbooking + some smart touchscreen TV with a Fire Stick because this seems simple enough and up to 10 screens are free.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiya, I work for an organisation with around 400 users, when it comes to Adobe most just use Adobe Reader but we currently have around 60 users licensed for Acrobat Pro and about 20 licensed for Creative Cloud. IT management want to recharge the cost of these licenses to departmental/team cost codes, but we're really struggling with how to keep track of which licenses belong to which team. When a new license is purchased it just goes into one big pool in our Adobe Admin Console, we can allocate it to a new user but there's nothing identifiable about the license itself so no real way to track it as an asset or tag it as owned by a particular team. What would be ideal is a system where we can create groups for different teams and then allocate licenses to each group, I'm just wondering if there's any tool or method that makes this easily possible? Currently all I think to do is have a process of meticulous record keeping in an Excel workbook where we track how many licenses are purchased under each cost code and who is using each license, but this obviously isn't ideal. We need to ensure that licenses are kept within the teams that are paying for them rather than moving around the organisation as people join and leave.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 ​
 I don't know why, but it's easy for me to understand the core concepts of MPLS than MTU...
 Yes, by "MTU" I still mean Maximum Transmission Unit. I have read all these blogs, watched all these videos explaining MTU and its problems, but still here I am and ask for your help. 
 Let's say we have some simple topology: 
 Switch-A - Router - Switch-B 
 Switches are just L2 switches, all routing happens on the router (which is actually L3 switch). Assume that all switches have 48 access ports and support Jumbo frames. Some servers and clients are connected to these access switches in a random way. 
 Okay, now I want to enable Jumbo frames on my network because some (only some!) servers require this. I did it on all ports between network equipment, so there is no MTU mismatch on the network core. Now, let's say I enabled Jumbo frames support on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports. So we have:
  
Jumbo frames are enabled on all links between network devices.
 Jumbo frames are enabled on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports.
 All other access ports and devices connected to these ports have default MTU.
 
 My questions are:
  
What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to a server with 9000+ MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?
 What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?
 What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to the server with 9000+ MTU if: Client and Server are in the different subnets?
 What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the different subnets?
  
Thanks.

Seems like every time I turn on the news or anything these big companies are getting compromised.

To know if I make 1 mistake or forget to patch 1 thing and open a hole I could ruin a company. It is starting to affect my home life as well. 
 How do people cope with this? I have really been thinking about switching careers, but no idea what I would want to do. I love technology and can't see myself do anything else but can't go on living like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genuinely asking as I see a lot of people post in this subreddit about the negatives of working at an MSP. No surprise here, I currently work at an MSP. And while it is absolutely crazy sometimes, I also find myself listening to our customers talk about their jobs and they all seem extremely stressed as well. What I personally like about the MSP life is that it offers diversity:
  
Diversity of equipment. Every customer brings a different set of “happy little accidents” to the table and I find that challenge interesting even if I’m not personally the one helping to architect new solutions.
 
Diversity of focus. If you want to be pigeon-holed or expertise in a specific area, you can. But there are also tons of opportunities for crossover experiences in other areas.
 
Diversity of customer. Yes you get difficult customers. But you also get some pretty great ones to work alongside. I feel like this is a big benefit and helps to balance the crazy sometimes.
 
Diversity of ideas. In some ways you’re playing with house money. You can help the customer come up with solutions without having to worry about the dollars and cents. After all, that’s on them to figure out at the end of the day. Obviously you have to be reasonable and help work toward something that benefits everyone involved. But again, that’s a challenge that can be fulfilling.
 
 Those are just a few. And sure, you could read those with the same lenses of a non-MSP job. But isn’t that the point? Why is it such a negative too work at an MSP? Interested to hear from others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 We have a few networks that are through vWire. We recently experienced an issue with one of these networks where some the clients (static IPs) could no longer reach their gateway/Internet.
 Meanwhile, a different client on the same network was operating just fine and reaching its gateway/Internet.
 On our Nexus, we disabled the interface that was leading to the passive PAN. The issue was instantly resolved. We re-enabled the interface, experienced no issues for a few days only for the issue to return. LLDP is enabled in PAN for vWire if that helps.
 Any suggestions? I'd appreciate it, thanks!
 C9300, Stacked (between internal PAN and WAN PAN): interface TenGigabitEthernet1/1/6 description PA5430-1 vWire eth1/11 ae3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 switchport mode trunk interface TenGigabitEthernet2/1/6 description PA5430-2 vWire eth1/11 ae3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 switchport mode trunk Nexus 9K: interface Ethernet1/12 description PA5430-1 vWire eth1/12 ae4 switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 speed 10000 no shutdown interface Ethernet1/12 description PA5430-2 vWire eth1/12 ae4 switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 speed 10000 
 Edit:
 We're currently using Aggregate Ethernet for vWire in PAN.
 vWire when using Aggregate Ethernet does not support LACP, just LLDP.
 We're thinking of just removing AE to standalone links with LACP. Thoughts?

I have the above Nexus layer 3 switch with a 1G ethernet transceiver and a CATx cable around 20m length plugged to an HP laptop also with an onboard ethernet port, auto-speed/duplex at both ends. The problem is that despite both ends being logically active, the link reports as not connected, when both ends are then physically connected. Bring down and bring back up the port on the Laptop (Windows Networking disable/enable) everything springs into life. Same symptoms observed plugging into another network device, although in that case, no option exists to manually down/up the interface (cheap IP cam) Plug the same devices and the cable into another switch, different brand but same logical configuration - it all comes up first time. So to me it's not the cable, and points to something on the Nexus. Nexus port config however is a really simple one;
 Interface eth1/27 switchport switchport access vlan 3 no shutdown 
 Has anybody seen this before, or could offer some clues on further diagnostic actions please?

I'll make the analogy of when IP devices exploded and your spreadsheet was no longer an option. 
 If you wanted something rock solid to manager your IPs you bought either Infoblox or Bluecat. If your environment was not too large you could get away with Solar Winds which at the time was more of a spreadsheet on steroids.
 Does any such Whitebox solution exist if I were to get some Edgecore switches?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Cisco WLC wifi network. I'm using full endpoint isolation..
 I'd like to allow client-to-client connectivity, but only when the clients authenticated with the same credentials. For example, if UserA has a TV & laptop both authenticated as "UserA", I'd like UserA to be able to Chromecast from their laptop to TV. UserB would be able to ssh from UserB's laptop to desktop, but not send anything to UserA's devices. It seems like it would be a common requirement? 
 There are thousands of separate users, so manual per-user ACLs on the WLC are probably not going to work.

 I have a manager who knows nothing about IT and never remembers anything we teach them. 
 For the first time today, I had to step out while I had a breakdown because I couldn't take this. Shit is in flames every other day, but we can't even improve our infrastructure because we don't have time to do anything outside of playong catch up with patching.
 Nobody has specified tasks or jobs, and nobody is being held accountable for their mistakes. How the hell do you guys do this, because I'm already second-guessing my choice of taking this path. I didn't sign up for a job where I do tickets, patch EUDs, troubleshoot server issues, and am being screamed at in my ear to hurry to Win11. 
 For reference, we have 1000+ rotating users and devices across the entire US. We have staff at each site, but most only do tickets.

 Boss presented me with an interesting question - How can we be notified of an IP address conflict/duplicate IP on the network automatically?

 So, I wanted your input! What is your go-to method of detecting IP conflicts before problems arise? I'm sure I could script something up to scrape our ARP table on the edge-device and look for duplicates but hoping for something more graceful.

 Currently we have an ISIS Adjacency between a CPE (Juniper) and 2 PEs (CISCO IOS XR) , however the link between the CPE and the Primary CPE (Primary Link) is suffering packet loss.
 Since the hello timer is big enough , ISIS does not detect a failure and hence packets are sent through that faulty link and many packets are lost.
 If we configured BFD with the ISIS , the ISIS adjacency will be flapping between the 2 links / PEs , which is something that we dont want to have.
 Is there anyway to solve this problem , for example to keep the ISIS cost on that link high , untill the link is guranteed to be stable and with no packet loss then it use that primary link ?
 I am open also for any other ideas.
 Thank You.

 Anyone have any luck lately landing a fully remote position? I've been fully remote for like five years and it feels like more and more orgs are viewing it as taboo, meanwhile it makes zero sense to me...especially for companies that don't have the space to have employees onsite. 
 Feels like companies are more concerned about making you waste your time and cut productivity in half just to justify some form of an office space and real estate expenses. 
 I've been looking for a new gig for about 5 months now because the startup I joined is entirely dysfunctional and I'm doing 38 different jobs for one salary and I legit can't handle it anymore, the market feels like it's entirely frozen over. Even the postings that are available online I don't get a single hit on. Or I get a recruiter who responds to me via direct message on LinkedIn and never follows up.

 i am basically done with my knowledge.
 We have an enviroment where all computers got moved from one domain to another.
 The procedure was:
 Remove computer from old domain
 Add computer to new domain
 Between the old and the new domain was never a trust setup and they don't share a name.
 But now it gets strange:
 All computers that were in the old domain apply a policy for user privleges with the old "Domain User" Group and the old GUID. (I compared the guids)
 The computers are not a member of that domain anymore and we dont figure out why they apply those old policies.
 The new Policy with the new "Domain Users"-Group wont be applied at those two offices but within the main office the policy gets applied (it was connected to the old domain controllers.)
 ​
 The profiles with the old domain still exist on the computer but are not active anymore.
 The old DC is still arround (data is needed) but we cut the connection and applied the policies again and it still applies the old group.
 In HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\GroupPolicy\History are no suspicies entries.
 ​
 I know its kinda confusing and i can try make a bit clearer.
 ​
 Thank you for your help!
 ​
 P.S: I am sorry for the confusing text, i try edit it, to be more clear!

But i need a tiny hotspot that i can potently keep in my car or bag and provide wifi pretty far. Reason is strange. I do alot of work for my offices where for some reason LTE or 5G is horrible inside the building. The other day i discovered if i place my cradlepiint right by the window and use wifi i can have connection in the data closets. My issue i cannot carry a big ass Asus router always. I was was hoping to something smaller and with reception
 Nice to have 1. Smaller 2. Good atenta with good reach 3. Poe powered or convert my self to USB PD using Barrel or power it using adapter and power cradle point of it using POE
 Cheers 
 Sorry if this the wrong place to ask for this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I've been trying out different remote softwares to use instead of teamviewer/anydesk. The purpose is to control different laptops in a congress centre and all I need is to be able to control the OS. 
 Now I've tried Splashtop and Screenconnect and Google Remote all to my frustration. What I like about Teamviewer and Anydesk is that I download 1 app that I can connect from and to. It seems the ones I tried all need a different host and client app(splashtop), need logging in from a browser (google, screenconnect), need to create a secured token per session (screenconnect), or shortkeys can't be used (google). I don't need any bells and whistles since I'm not offering remote support, I just need basic control of my own laptops. A steady connection to about 12 laptops from 3-4 laptops in a directors booth with the possibility of connecting through a code with a possibility to remember/save the connections that I made will do just fine. 
 Anyone got a suggestion for a well functioning, really basic and cheaper alternative to Teamviewer/Anydesk?
 Cheers!

 I am running into some issues with a scheduled task that was created on a Windows 08 server and got imported into a Window Server 2019 server. 
 There are 3 "Actions" specified within the job, each of which makes a call to a batch file. (Each of these batch file involves with copying file from a local folder to a SFTP server. The exact same scheduled job works perfectly fine on the Windows 08 server but when I run on on our Win 2019 server, 
 I kept getting this below error code 2147942401
 Task Scheduler successfully completed task "\task1" , instance "{da5651d2-d5b3-4e1a-8844-c68c7dcba160}" , action "C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\cmd.exe" with return code 2147942401.
 I spent hours and hours trying to troubleshoot but I am not getting anywhere. 
 So far I tried 
  
Added the account with sufficient privilege to "Log on as a batch job" in Local Security Policy
  specified the "Start In" folder path 
 using Powershell within the scheduled task to call the batch files 
  
None of the above work, those batch files work if I just double click on them. 
 Any help would be much appreciated :)

 Before i run into several errors i want to know your experience and opinion about fs logix.
 Do you have any problems with it? What happens when i login one user on two servers? for example when i use a loadbalancer and one server crashes, so the loadbalancer switch the user to an other server.
 Do you have experiences with profile curruption?
 Currently i use romaing profiles.
 Do you guys have made other experiences - good or bad? Please let me know so i can be prepared.
 Thanks in advance.

Until that time I've got a reoccurring issue where the vNic on the server will just fail to resolve dns. Internal dns works, external does not. I've even manually added external dns (like 8.8.8.8) and it still won't resolve. All other servers on this domain work fine. The only fix I've been able to get to work, but not permanently, is to remove the vnic from vsphere, and then add a new one, and configure it with the static ip and such. Anyone run into this before and have a solution, or am I missing something simple here?

 I'm here in hopes you can give me an idea what might be the issue with the following problem:
 The customers has Exchange online with two shared mailboxes attached to their account, to counter the lag they experience when clicking on E-Mail, I've enabled the Exchange Cache. That does just fine for their main email but for the shared mailboxes this doesn't work at all, nothing is loaded it's just empty.
 If I disable it again, everything works great. Currently I'm running Exchange Offline with "Downloading Shared Mailboxes" disabled but that's obviously suboptimal as I want them to be cached too.
 - It's the latest Windows 10
 - Latest Version of Outlook 2019
 - Tried creating a new profile
 - Tried deleting the cache manually
 It's just like Shared Mailboxes is cursed for me. What am I doing wrong?

 I also noticed this "Note" on that Microsoft article:
  
Clearing the check box won’t remove WebView2 Runtime from devices on which it has already been installed. Only new installations of WebView2 Runtime are prevented.
 There is no policy setting (for Group Policy or Cloud Policy) to turn off the automatic installation of the WebView2 Runtime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are some funny encounters that I had while helping around with some IT work. Some of them could be avoided by provisioning better training, others maybe people just had a bad day.
 #1 I once got a call to see a computer asap that "definitely had a virus".
 On the same day, I got delivered there a new keyboard there.
 When entering the office I was welcomed by a guy showing me how each of the apps he would open would not work properly and in word... space button would be pressed continuously.
 As you could probably tell by now, the virus was on a shelf, where the old keyboard was stored, pressing the space button. 
 #2 After setting up an entry system with an intercom, I went home to get a very disappointing call just before entering my place. "The system is not working." After troubleshooting remotely, I had to be on my way to see what is happening. I get a phone call just before, saying that they just realised that someone pressed the break glass button to exit the building. The emergency button had a case around it and looked very different from the exit one which is touch-free.
 A couple of days later, when setting their cards, I could see that someone would answer the intercom and they would go to open the door manually. But this one is on me, I did not leave specific instructions on how to unlock it. 
 #3 Once got called in to help someone find the attach button from outlook. I've also had numerous cases of "it's not working", "is it plugged?", "nevermind, thank you".

 A client of mine is looking after an event for a client in the finance sector who has previously had trouble sharing and controlling the digital assets generated for they’re annual conference. Think loads of powerpoint files and video content. Changes and updates are frequently made right up until the presenter walks onstage.
 The assets are generated by the end client’s own internal teams hence the usual solutions of ftp/dropbox/removable media that we would rely on are off the table due to the end client’s security policies.
 My first thought was some hosted storage appliance that we could replicate locally once we get onsite. That way the client’s IT can administer the appliance as they see fit and the local clone/cache will ensure speedy transfers once we get to the pointy end onsite at the event and need to ingest to the show machines. The event is well supported internally and the internal IT teams have been pretty good to work with on similar events in the past as long as we are reasonable in our requests and timescales.
 Any thoughts/reactions from those in the finance sector?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK, so every tutorial out there makes this more confusing than it needs to be, as far as I understand it. I've been running my own mailservers (I know, it's a challenge) for about 25 years now, fairly successfully (my server's mail gets accepted by the big players, which was a tough task to accomplish over the years, but I finally got Microsoft to clear my IP-addresses, even though they assumed they were part of an entirely bad reputable block of addresses). OK, so here I am, strange how even I question the use of _dmarc every now and then. As a result of weird behavior while migrating from server 1 to server 2 I had to change _dmarc policy to none.
 SPF is correct, DKIM passes for all, but I just want to be certain;
 All mail account users and mail-domains reside behind one hostname and one IPv4 and one IPv6 address. They all send and receive mail using those, SMTP is on that one address. Am I still correct in assuming that setting policy to "reject" should be fine then?
 No other servers should try and send mail using any of our system's domain names. If they do, mail should be rejected. None of my users try to use gmail or others to use our email-addresses as aliases, so that problem is non existent. And websites using these domainnames, that may have mail-forms are all using our smtp as well. Are there any exceptions to this that I'm missing?

 Initially, this is specifically for P2P Dedicated/Private Ethernet Services (ie: sub10G, 10G, 100G international services), typically used for production networks and backbones.
 - Do you use Ethernet P2P (EPL) services and what for? 
 - What network statistics and reporting would help you run your networks?
 - How would you want such information presented (Portals? Reports? APIs?)
 - What problems would this help you solve?
 - What is one wish you had for your service provicer?

When the issue appeared again, we decided to give the user a brand new device but it started happening again. We suspect it might be one of the Apps he installs without our knowledge.

ADHD is misnamed. It's not really about Attention Deficit or Hyperactivity, that's just two of the first symptoms seen in children. It doesn't get renamed because it's in legislation (including the ADA). 
 
It's about Executive Function, and in Adults that shows up differently. It can be a hyperactive brain. It can be difficulty maintaining concentration. But it can also be difficult to stop concentrating on something that you find fascinating. Most adults can 'get by' if they've only a mild form of this disability. (I did for 30+ years).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following on from my previous query here, I'm having more problems with Failover Clustering VM resources that I can't delete. u/BlackV please help me again :)
 I have a Hyper-V Failover Cluster managed by VMM where there are about 8 VMs that have "disappeared" from Hyper-V but at still listed in Failover Clustering. The Failover Clustering console shows them as "offline" and attempts to delete them fail with an error saying they are moving. The output of `Get-ClusterGroup` shows the group state as `Pending`. I don't routinely manage this cluster anymore, so I don't know the precise details of whatever happened over the weekend to trigger this odd state.
 The VMs still exist (the config is still on the disk) so I'm hoping I can remove the old VM registration in Failover Clustering, re-register the VM in place and add it back.
 Things I've tried:
  
Deleting the resource group in the Failover Clustering console - fails, information details says the request could not be accepted because the group is moving
 Deleting the child resource (i.e. the actual VM resource) in the Failover Clustering console - fails (sorry can't remember the precise error for that one)
 Using the `DestroyGroup(...)` WMI method on the resource group - hangs
 Using the `DeleteResource(...)` WMI method on the child resources - hangs, but the child resource is marked as deleted, clustering still shows it however
  
Once again, I'm after any suggestions on how to clean this up without taking down the entire cluster.

 If I understand correctly, Microsoft issued the original patch in June 2021, then re-issued the patch in June 2022, then again re-issued the patch in November 2022, and will again re-issue the patch in March 2023.
 I am trying to identify which version of the patch has been installed on a host today. Is the system running on the June 2021 version, the June 2022 version, or the November 2022 version - (and eventually, the March 2023 version).
 I have tried using WMIC and DISM queries, but these patches appear to be part of the cumulative monthly updates and aren't individually listed.
 Hoping there is a DLL file version that can be checked... or something I am missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have no idea if this is the right forum for this question, but a group that I work with has been asked to set up a WIFI mesh network for a number of semi-permanent camps. The idea is to provide free wifi to roughly 60-100 sites (read homes) that will be equipped with a low-cost router enabling several family members to connect to.
 There's been some back and forth on what equipment to use, but I was hoping that there was a best-practices standard that we could fall back on. Reliability, affordability, and ease of maintenance are the three top priorities (in that order) for this project. It will be really hard to service the APs and routers hooked up to the local fiber network that will be provided by a telco.
 The idea is to set up "smart" poles that will be used to mount the APs as well as all of the grounding equipment etc.
 Thanks again for any and all advice -- we will most likely need to contract this out but I wanted to check with this sub first just to get a general idea of min/max including projected costs.

 when we connected the core switch (1st floor) with the dell switch (2nd floor) both switch doesnt link up. but when we brought the core switch to the second floor and connected via LC-LC cable without the interfloor patch board, both switches linked up so were thinking the patch board is at fault here.
 heres a few pattern that we tried
 Juniper Core(1st Floor) [LR/LC]<--->[SMF/SC] patch board [SMF/SC]<--->[LR/LC] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) = No Link up
 Juniper Core(2nd Floor) [LR/LC]<--->[LR/LC] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) = Link up
 Juniper Core(1st Floor) [UTP Port]<--->[UTP Port] patch board [UTP Port]<--->[UTP Port] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) = Link up
 is there any other method we can connect the 10G thorough 2 floors? i dont know if the problem actually resides on the patch board aswell...worst case we might have to use a few UTP cable and create a LAG and maybe make it 2~4Gish
 any help is more than appreciated

 While doing our yearly phone system public holiday update I notice sysadmin appreciation day is not on the Fun Calendars of timeanddate.com but something like Ferris wheel day is !?!? Fun Holidays - Funny, Random & Weird Holidays (timeanddate.com) 
 Would it be too much to ask r/sysadmin to lodge a quick feedback to get it added for greater exposure?
 Feedback on timeanddate.com 
 Of course, reasoning generated by chatGPT for quick copy paste.
 Hi Team,
 ​
 Timeanddate.com should consider adding System Administrator Appreciation Day to their fun calendars because it is an important day that recognizes the hard work and dedication of system administrators who play a critical role in keeping computer networks and systems running smoothly. By adding this day to their fun calendars, Timeanddate.com can help raise awareness and appreciation for the important work that system administrators do, while also providing a fun way for people to show their appreciation for these unsung heroes of the tech world. Additionally, this would be an opportunity for Timeanddate.com to attract a new audience of tech professionals and enthusiasts who are likely to be interested in this type of content.
 ​
 System Administrator Appreciation Day has been observed now for its 24th year with a dedicated website https://sysadminday.com/ and has been mentioned through several press yearly since 2001 please see: https://sysadminday.com/?page_id=70 for press mentions.

There are plans to hire international employees as full time so I've been looking into onboarding via Autopilot, including purchasing equipment via CSP with localized keyboards and everything. I've lots to figure out there but it seems to cover all our needs. 
 However, I've got to think about offboarding in the future as well. I'm not against allowing folks to keep their equipment assuming we're able to remotely wipe the device and the offboard is friendly. But for cases where the employee needs to surrender the device, I'd rather not ship equipment all over the planet. And even if we can get the equipment back, we won't really have a need for laptops with non-qwerty keyboards.
 For those in similar setups, what's your approach to dealing with decommissioned international devices that are used in ninch business cases like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm trying to determine the best systems to use and wanted to get your opinions. 
 Current environment:
  
Employees: 70
 IT: 1 member
 Mixed environment - Windows/Mac computers (80/20) + Linux VMs. 
 Computers are not managed/domain-joined. 
 
 The majority of the business workloads reside on AWS. 
 Small on-prem footprint - local server for internal application/file server 
 File server is used to temporarily store files generated locally before it is then uploaded to AWS for processing. 
 
 Google workspace is used for email, storage, etc. 
 Currently using Google SSO to authenticate to other SaaS applications. 
 
 Microsoft 365 is also in place with similar licensing as Google Workspace. 
 Primarily used for office suite/collaboration via SharePoint. 
 
  
Ideally, I would like to tie everything to a single IDP and need a device to serve local DHCP (multiple VLANs)/DNS for internal resources. 
 I was leaning toward a hybrid environment since there is already some on-prem infrastructure so I was planning to spin up an AD environment off the same hardware. 
 Alternatively, I was considering a cloud-only environment leveraging AzureAD/Intune but in this scenario, I would want to migrate everyone off GW to M365 to take advantage of the additional features offered like conditional access, etc.
 The last option I am considering is JumpCloud. It seems to meet my requirements as far as a centralized directory, IDP, policies, and support for MacOS/Linux. But I never used this platform before so uncertain how it performs. 
 Any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you.

 TIMEOUT=30
 /sbin/ifconfig eth1 up
 /sbin/ifconfig eth1 172.52.100.61 netmask 255.255.255.0
 /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up

 /sbin/route add 172.16.0.0/16 via 172.17.254.254 default via 172.52.100.18

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helping a company with 80 users (windows laptops) that started using Crowdstrike Falcon + EDR + Overwatch a few months ago without knowing that Microsoft Defender for Business was included in their 365 Premium subscription. Now, I have nothing against Crowdstrike, its a great product, specially if you have Overwatch, however, it lacks on network protection and web filtering, and since this is a must have (in my opinion), the company needs to spend more money on a third party software (like dnsfilter for example).
 Since MS Defender for business is included in their license, I’m inclined to recommend them to make the switch from Crowdstrike to MS Defender for business. Then, with the money that is saved, buying dnsfilter (or other product) for an extra layer of protection , and invest more on security awareness training for the users and still save a lot of money!
 Would you do the same?
 P.S: I know Crowdstrike is a great product and security is not about saving money, but in this case I think we can actually improve their overall security by moving to defender.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having issues adding a device using SNMPv3. I have an old server setup and it’s out of date so I am needing to move to a new one that I have created. This new one is setup with an IP in the same range as the old one, both have a private network with the exact same up range. The old one will discover my devices via snmp and I can ping each individual device from the web console of it. The new one will not discover the devices, I enter they discovery info the exact same way as the old one and get nothing. This one will not ping the devices. Running a traceroute on the old server, it shows that it connects directly to the device in question. No other hops. Running a traceroute to the same device on the new one shows that it is going out to out ISP and so forth. 
 What could I be missing to enable this new server to talk to all of my APC devices. 
 From what I can see on all of my switches there is no routes or anything point these devices to the old server. It’s gotta be a routing issue somewhere right or am I missing something?

 We currently operate using a UDM Pro firewall and a PoE switch, security cameras, and two long-range access points, all from Unifi. Unfortunately, we keep having issues with reliability. Failed hardware and broken firmware updates have caused a lot of headaches over the past year.
 We are outgrowing Unifi hardware and need to upgrade to something with more reliability. People have recommended Ruckus for switches and access points, but I'm curious about other options.

 Fluke=Failed.
 Klein Scout 2 (7-8 years old)=failed.

 Amazon $40 tester=Passed.
 Actual Ubiquity switch into wall=failed. 
 I was hoping my issue is that I have a cheap Amazon tester (I need to test a cable maybe once every three weeks). But the Klein's couldn't decide if it was good or not. I was set to buy the Klein Scout 3 before I asked a different tech where I work to verify the results with his tester. I pulled, bended, put on tension on the jack, and it would still pass.
 Can cables fit into a margin of error for testers? I know Klein tools have degraded in quality, have their testers done that as well (the passing Scout is younger than the one that failed it). Or why would testers not agree on this cable (5e, hand terminated on both ends)

 Obviously, not for production purposes. I haven't completely lost my mind (yet...)

 i tried contacting the manager but to no use... no answer to my phone calls and i ask the dept director what the mail was about, and he forwards the mail and i did some research and i found out from an overview graph that the sketchy link with numbers and shit leads to 2 end points, 1 of them is one drive and another to an IP.
 after this i mailed all our staff giving them a warning of the phishing campaign and asked them not to click on any links blindly.
 my question to you my fellow admins is what can i do or what would you do to prevent any of this from happening again... because the industry were in, we don't want critical info leak and as the person in charge i think i should take responsibility even though no one is taking this serios and assess the situation and find a way to prevent it from happening again.
 what should i do? please help
 ​
 i was thinking of suggesting to run a GoPhish campaign, to give the staff a reality check by changing the passwords of the employees who fall it and then give a training on this.

Between shows, the iPads have to be refreshed - wiped of any client data, wallpaper potentially updated (for white-label service), reset settings, update iOS, etc. The app the startup provides on the iPad is distributed via TestFlight and that too has to be updated. I have researched a lot of potential solutions for management software, but haven’t found any of them that specifically mention devices that are leant or rented out (and potential issues around that type of usage that the management software accommodates). Also, looks like none of them can update a TestFlight app. Looking for an affordable solution with intuitive management dashboard/interface. What are some of the best mdm options for this scenario?

 I get that someone could steal a domain laptop, but at the moment we're not checking for that. We want to get 8021x embedded and working first before branching out to maybe different vlans and auth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I’m really unsure if this is the correct place to ask, so if it isn’t, just let me know and I’ll move on :-)
 I have a project in mind that I’m unwilling to start until I get a second opinion. 
 Background: I have many USB devices each streaming sensor data at a very random, potentially very high rate. The current method of listening to these devices is to connect them all to a large hub and listen on whichever computer I’m using to record the data. Processing is done as data arrives, etc. This is manageable, but undesirable for a couple reasons:
  
Only one PC can listen at a time
 
To reduce bandwidth cost, the devices do not report human-readable data. Rather, the host is responsible for deserializing/parsing the data as it’s streamed though
 
 Solution: Have a single server computer dedicated to listening to the serial streams, parsing, then passing the stream to clients around the network in a more desirable format. Extending this, I suppose there could be multiple “sub” servers forwarding to a main server which distributes to whoever is listening, but I’m not going to bother with that at the moment. 
 My question(s) to you: 
  
Is this worth pursuing? At its core, all I’m doing is forwarding usb bits to the network and moving the parsing work to a different computer. At the moment, a single computer solution is working just fine, if annoying. 
 
Has anyone done anything like this? 
 
 Thank you!

There's no structure to anything, they use Workspace, 365, Dropbox, Slack, Zoom and probably more idk about yet. There's no SSO, all accounts siloed, many of them just consumer accounts created by the staff themselves. Devices are both Mac and Windows, no MDM, AV, domain join etc. all local accounts with admin. 
 They're looking to double staff count year on year so I need to get an IdP in place ASAP. For me this has always been AD, however I've never been somewhere this wasn't already in place. What would people here recommend as an IdP for a small company with 1 IT person to manage it?
 Should I just go with AD? (Hybrid) or look at newer stuff like Okta and similar?
 It's a R&D company that's entire existence relies on it's internal research data, that currently any employee can easily walk out the door with. I'm coming from the legal sector where security, compliance and audits were very high priority and I/We had built out several layers to achieve this. Coming into this place, while I realise now is probably normal, gets my heart rate up.
 ​
 Appreciate any assistance!

 I'm currently working in a windows environment with ~16 separate offices that are connected via an SD-WAN. We have a vendor specific application with manages some of it's printing thru a VPN to a print server for some of our printers, but individual PDF/document printing is managed via the machine itself. 
 We don't currently have any sort of centralized print management. Leadership wants to avoid any sort of standard print server due to single-point-of-failure. But are there any solutions to manage the deployment of printer devices to machines while allowing windows clients to continue to manage individual print jobs? 
 We do currently use Connectwise Automate as an RMM and have it deployed acroos >95% of the network, and a Hybrid Azure AD. I've seen mention of GPO by user OUs but a lot of our users move between locations. Are there machine bound solutions?

 AT&T /30 --> AT&T Router --> CPE FW (with old /29 Inbound NATs) 
 Proposed Design:

 I am in government sector IT and have a few areas in our jurisdictions which ISPs report meeting the FCC guidelines for broadband, however residents within those pockets complain of quality and speeds from that ISP. We're looking to challenge the FCC maps to allow other providers to come in with infrastructure grants to complete fiber to the home for all homes in our jurisdiction which we have minus these cable provider pockets which providers hold the territory and only provide the bare minimum speeds to lock other providers out. 
 Okay... now for what I'm looking for....
 I'm looking for a hardware device which we can have residents plug into their service providers modem which will collect results on ping, jitter, downtimes, and run periodic speed tests.
 I'm thinking a PI or or Nuc which can run some software to do this... the question is... which software will do all of this for us?
 It can be any operating system, ideally be able to push reports back to us for us to challenge locations and ISPs faster and less purchase on our end as we can move devices faster.

 How does one get a "valid client certificates" ? 
 Alternately, can one purchase a intermediate cert of some kind to sign your own as needed so that they are then "certificate issued by reputable certificate authorities " ? IE. you have 10's of devices.
 PG&E currently supports only SHA-2 X.509 certificates issued by reputable certificate authorities (PG&E does not accept self-signed certificates) Data requests and responses are made using the HTTPS protocol and are authenticated via a two-way certificate exchange with PG&E, requests between you and PG&E are over mutual SSL and require that you attach your client SSL certificate to your request.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! We are running a product documentation portal using WordPress (not the best solution I know, but development time was essential) and IIS 10 on Windows Server 2022. Access to this portal is delegated by us, so nobody can register on his own. If a user wants to access the documentation files (pdf, zip, etc.), he must log in to the portal.
 All files are currently in the data/ folder which is in the root folder of the app that is also exposed by IIS on the internet. The data/ folder is custom made and not part of WP by default. The issue with this situation is that everybody that knows the folder name and filename can directly access it as an anonymous user, which is a security risk (for instance, if our domain is example.com, you can navigate to example.com/data/sample.pdf and download the file without logging in).
 Is there a solution on how to set it up in the web.config or some setting in IIS that you can prevent that behavior? I'd like that only users logged into the WP portal can download the files.
 I thought about moving the data/ folder from the app root folder into a folder that is not directly exposed by IIS, but I believe that WordPress would have huge problems accessing that files.
 Edit: I believe IIS (and not WP) is allowing anonymous users to download the files in the data/ folder as it is exposed to the internet. The general idea I'm currently looking at is how to tell IIS which user is authenticated by WP and which is not? Maybe by looking at a Cookie or something?

The policies and training became mandatory in the workplace, in schools and on college campuses. Today you often can’t apply for a job or admission to a college or graduate school without making a statement about your commitment to DEI policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just completed renaming our domain controllers domain name using rendom. However after, I realized that none of the DNS records in the original forwarding lookup zone (FLZ) changed. They were still all under the old FLZ. I can only assume that migration of these records was not apart of the process of rendom (is that true?)
 If so I am trying to use a powershell script to migrate from one FLZ to the new FLZ. This worked, and I converted all the PTR records as well with powershell. 
 The question is, is this what I should be doing to migrate to the new FLZ after rendom?

 I’ve been job hunting unsuccessfully for months, eventually giving up hope on finding anything that I was actually going to be excited about. I had come to terms with needing to accept anything I could just to survive, and was applying to call centers and help desks again. 
 But then this job came around and it fits my skills and experience perfectly and I’m actually really happy and grateful and excited…! I can’t wait to get started! 
 And I’m so relieved to be done job hunting. It’s been a nightmare.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been doing SNMP metrics collection for 20 years now with a modified MRTG setup that in addition to storing the data in native RRD files also sends the data to a TSDB which is then fronted by a heavily automated Grafana instance. Now that the world is very slowly moving away from SNMP and towards metrics via REST API and streaming telemetry (Cisco MDT for example) I am starting to research paid metrics collector suites like SolarWinds, PRTG, Zabbix, etc. So far I'm unimpressed with SolarWinds in that it is still using a classic SQL DB for metrics storage instead of a modern TSDB approach. I also don't like the fact that the data is more or less locked in SW - I need to be able to stream a copy of it as close to real time as possible for analysis in other platforms (think a TSDB with ML components). 
 Bonus points for netflow collector and analysis discussion too.

 Oracle has already started reaching out to us about this change. If this is all true they have just given me every reason to do everything I can to rip Java out. We already try to use openJDK or MS’s version of Java, unfortunately there are some tools that just don’t work with them.

 EDIT: Yes, user was signed into a Temp profile. I have just tried renaming/removing ".bak" in the ProfileList, and settings State and RefCount both to 0, and restarted. Upon attempted login, it did the same again - only logging into a Temp profile.

 I'm trying to find a good "Change Tracking" system, not management. As in, I don't need an approval process and advanced workflow system. This is for myself and one tech, all of the final changes are passed through me, but I am looking for something free, basic and cloud based if possible.
 Ideally it would have the ability to add devices or software applications, and tie a "Date", change made with notes/attachment to each item. With basic search capability, keyword, date, device, etc.
 I've looked at and demoed Jira Service Management, and the Atlassian products. While this looks like an amazing product for an enterprise wide management/control/service desk system, it is way too much for our needs.
 I'm not opposed to something self hosted with PHP/MySQL either, but am not looking for anything NIX based.
 The purpose of this is to be able to fall back on the info if something else is affected later on, or we run into the issue or similar issue again.

 One server gets the new/modified data and I'd like the two child servers to sync data from the parent one automatically - Ideally I'd like the storage to be mirrored, i.e. I want deleted files on the parent storage server to be deleted on the child servers as well.
 What solution should I be looking for? FTP with scheduled transfers? If so, what client supports mirroring of the file structure as well as bandwidth control/scheduling?
 All servers are running WS2019/WS2022 and there are no DB's or VM's that are being copied. Client solution preferred over scripting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time ago I made the switch to another company: less hours, better pay, shorter commute - all really nice things. But what I appreciate the most is how my new manager treats us: I had to do an upgrade for a business critical application (we talk multiple millions in revenue just from this application per week) after hours. It was scheduled to start at 5.45pm, but at 5.30 I got a call "we need till" 6pm. Ok, no problem. But you know how it turned out... At 7.30pm I finally could start to shut down the running services. Unfortunately the installation routine runs for up to 60 minutes, even if it fails. So of course this happened multiple times and after some digging around in the log files and doing multiple steps manually that should run automatically, I was finished at around 1.30 in the morning.
 I informed my manager the next day (back at work at 8am) and his response was "First: Next time just tell them you will not start after the agreed upon time. It's our job to make sure this stuff works, but we are not responsible if they can't finish their work in time. Second: if something like this happens again, feel free to call me for support. I am usually awake till 2am anyways so just give me a call! Third: Go home and sleep - if you work longer hours, just come in later so you can get enough rest".
 Feeling the support of the people above me and knowing they will stand up for me and help is worth much more than all the things that made me switch jobs in the first place. For the first time in the last two years I enjoy my work again.
 And yes, I did take him by his word the next time something didn't go right: at 10pm I called him. He tried to help me figure it out and at 11 told me "I don't know what's wrong. You can stop now, I will take over“.

I got a new Internet connection from ISP A and they installed the Wi-Fi router. I changed its name to 'WIFI A' and pw to 'PASS1'(router access). My family was out of the country, and I had manually connected only 2 devices of mine to that newly installed Wi-Fi. But when they came back all of their devices got connected automatically without the need of entering a password. This is something new for me. One important thing to mention, we have a home in another city and its wifi name and password are the same but the device and the ISP are different. Is it possible that the devices knows the Wi-Fi router through its name not their MAC? And when it scanned for a Wi-Fi it got authenticated?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI, I work in a small forest equipment manufacturing company and we looking kind of CMDB/Asset management software but for to manufactured products. Preferable open source but reasonably priced (max 1000€ per year). There would be about 10-15 users.
 ​
 Basically we need able
  
to track all out product via serial number (or tag), find all related product
 add maintenance/change event to product
 find all product with certain attributes/value to send service bulletin to customers
 see product delivery date, warranty, options, change history of product
  
​
 Delivered product set could be like
 The broadest set of product
  
base machine
 crane
 harvester head
 measuring devices
 computer
  
Or single product
  
energy wood head
  
​
 I have looked asset managements software but al most every one is related to IT (Datacenter, racks, Networks, Computers, etc,). Is there general software where we can define product types/categories and dependable product and also customers?
 And yes, there is PDM but we looking more lightweight solution.
 Any hints where to look?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys
 I have an openvpn server set up on an Amazon Lightsail instance (London, UK) which to date, for the years I have been based in the UK, has worked flawlessly as my personal VPN, and has had a negligible impact on my download speeds.
 However, since recently moving to South East Asia, connecting through the same VPN is absolutely killing my internet speeds. This is a little surprising, as I understood that greater geographic distance from the server would increase 'ping' times, but actual download speeds should remain mostly unaffected?
 I am generally seeing speed test results that show connection speeds of ~40mb/s through public wifi networks being reduced to somewhere around ~4mb/s-- 10% of the actual underlying connection speed!
 I am looking at setting up another Lightsail instance in Singapore and cloning my OpenVPN files onto it. But I wonder if anyone can comment on why this is happening; is this at all as surprising to you guys as it was to me?

 I work for logistical company and I have noticed that one work process which the operators reapeat over 1000 times a day can be done much more effectively by using the full capabilities of already provided HW. I am sure I can improve the efficiency on this process by 10-20%. I have even tried configuring the HW in a proper way in test enviroment. It works, now I just need to implement it which is quite simple.
 Since the business will now have a great improvement in this process these operator positions will be much more profitable. Shouldn't I receive atleast some one time bonus for the extra effort I put in this?
 BTW: I won't make the process easier for the workers, if that was the case I wouldn't be asking the question and just implemented it. It just improves their efficiency.
 The though of receiveng a bonus can't leave my mind since monday and the moment I realised I can do 5 step task in 3 steps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently entered an org with a number of Windows servers, and have been trying to get our licensing in compliance and holy fucking shit, why the hell is Windows Server licensed like this? Per core licensing because fuck you, a Standard license (for the entire VM host) only allows two VMs, but a Datacenter license costs an arm and a leg. Even with non profit discounts, we end up paying $4400 to license three physical servers that can only run two VMs each (and the physical hardware is running ESXi), just to have the privilege of working with broken software. What's that? You want to separate out server roles, keep things more separate, without worrying about re-licensing the same hardware twenty times? Same environment, 25K. For Windows Server. I hate monopolies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we are going to remove our line interactive UPSes on the second supply side of our racks and provide them with straight utility power to save a little bit of power (I guess battery chargers are energy hogs or something). I tried to say this was as a bad idea and I was told that the generator will only take a few seconds to power up. My first thought was about power stability but apparently the electrical engineers have no problem providing 80 volts to 160 volts and that supply should just work fine. 
 My opinion is not even being considered so I'm just going to do it despite my objections. I feel like this is begging for problems.
 I think this is a horrible idea but I have been tasked to remove the redundant UPSes to save on maintenance costs because utility power is good enough!!
 So how does everyone feel about this assessment. Is it worth it to loose a layer of redundancy for a couple hundred dollars a month?
 Edit readability.

 Current job is help desk but we're so limited to do shit, it feels like a govt contractor t1. Can't create an ad account, many things go to admins that in any other job I did, I could do. 
 I'm thankful I have a job, but I also sense they want me gone as I haven't had benefits kick in post trial period. Haven't rocked that boat because I don't want to be unemployed no certs guy.

 I am currently stuck though, maybe because not a single person on the team is an "Apple guy" or something, but I have yet to find a Mac dock that does dual independent display (no mirroring) but also supports both Intel and the newer M1/M2 MBPs. The best looking ones currently we could find we're from Anker in the 775 and the OWC docks but those required thunderbolt to DP or HDMI converters too for the 2k resolution screens (TB displays aren't priced well compared to DP / HDMI ones).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked on ERP software at two separate businesses that was published by one of the largest software vendors in the world. That crap hasn't changed in any fundamental way since the 50s, no joke. They kept adding "modules" that you had to pay for which supposedly gave the software new functionality. In reality, they were user requested changes to code that didn't work correctly in the first place. Companies were literally paying even more money for upgrades and updates that should have been provided by the vendor. The software was so error prone and full of bugs it made me shiver with rage every time we paid the maintenance agreement.
 The money they burned trying to keep that shit marginally functional was appalling. Support was sold to overseas call centers which made even the most mundane issue a days long slog. They would always promise big new changes were coming and year after year they would dole out a new sliver that made the software slightly more usable than before, for a price. It was just a glorified DB with no real higher functionality. Data mining was an arduous manual process with no tools etc. to facilitate. It relied heavily on external tools for basic use including a gawd awful java interface that barely functioned. 
 It was slow, clunky, and contained NO automation of basic daily tasks. I invented multiple ways to mine what we needed and analyze millions of records for pertinent data. The lack of even basic input checks meant people were entering erroneous data on the regular that needed to be pruned, edited, or replaced. It became my full time job just keeping the wheels on. I will never work for another business that uses that crap as long as I live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm a sys engineer at a dental lab. We use ups worldship with crossware right now. It reads and writes case info to a local mssql database to pull in each shipment's info and to write a tracking number to the case in the DB.
 We ship a lot, 350+ packages a business day easily
 Anyone that has dealt with worldship, knows it doesn't scale well to this volume, but I've made it work through weekly db maintenance on the admin and various tweaks etc. So yes it works, but it's the kinda free program that isn't really free and when there's a problem their support is useless and one of the IT team has to stay late.
 So I'm wondering if anyone here has a shipping platform they like that can do all these things. Cloud and web based would be amazing as long as they can pull up the shipment info by scanning an invoice, plop it on the usb scale, hit a button and then it prints on a networked label printer. We are currently in one building, but we are outgrowing it, so the quick scalability of a browser based cloud app is desirable. I imagine the ui would be more modern than the xp/Vista asthetic of worldship too.
 We've looked into a few, like shiprush for example but, while they would work, they seem geared more towards Ecommerce orders and the onprem sql integrations are an after thought.
 So anyone here have recommendations for a shipping platform geared more towards manufacturing enterprises?
 Thanks friends!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone can help me stop pulling my hair out.
 My client has a SonicWall as their router, and we use Shaw as an ISP. Shaw called me last month and said our router is pulling too many IPs (~500) when we are only assigned 5. Nothing has changed in our configuration that would have caused this - I have literally not touched this client's network in over a year.
 So, checking their settings from the ISP, looks like:
 WAN IP: 1.2.3.200
 Subnet: 255.255.254.0
 Gateway: 1.2.3.1
 We are assigned the static IPs .200-.204
 Right off the bat, I'm thinking - there are your 500 IPs, its just getting everything on the subnet they gave me. Due to the gateway address, I can't make it smaller than 255.255.255.0. When I make that change, guess what? Now there's only 200-something IPs being pulled. They swear the original settings are correct.
 When I look in the SonicWall logs, I see lots of "failed TCP packets" from some China IP with a destination of another IP on the subnet that is not in our block of static IPs (lets say it is 1.2.3.50). Is there something configured in the SonicWall that is doing this?
 I told Shaw that their equipment should be restricting the IPs to whatever they give us, and its not my fault/problem. They came and replaced their modem today and it still has the same problem - pulling way too many IPs. Their next step is they want me to factory reset the SonicWall and set it up from scratch - no way am I doing that!
 Any thoughts?

 My boss says it’s vital that every admin who makes an action on the information system (servers, firewalls, switchs…) write every one of them on an excel file for example. He says that when we have a problem, we can look into it if someone made a change that could be the trigger.
 Is it just me or is it a complete waste of time ? Because when there’s a problem, I track it to the root to be 100% sure. Of course, I write down commands sometimes when they’re complex and I make documentation for me or my colleagues.
 What do you think ? Do you have to do it in your jobs or did you ? If some does it, which software do you use ?
 Thank you !
 Edit : we already do CAB every week where we discuss every change, plan the action and the rollback plan, etc…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody!
 It has been a while that I was asking myself how big Datacenter operators like Hetzner or OVH do that magic that forces the MAC address and IP binding so that if you, for example, change the MAC address of a VM you won't receive any more package, although having the IP correctly configured. Is that static ARP? Or something else?
 Second part of the question: transparent PPPoE offloading. Is there any device that is capable to terminate the PPPoE session and transparently pass it as IPv4 to my client(s)?
 Bonus: is there an appliance that implements both features?
 As you might have imagined, the deployment scenario is a /27 that my provider delivers over PPPoE and I would like to offload the session on a dedicated appliance and then bind single IP addresses to different MACs in my DMZ.
 I have a 2.5G WAN so target speed is around that but could have few 2.5/10G ports since clients will mainly be 1G.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm in the process of evaluating some access layer switch replacements for the SMB I work at. Here is what I'm having a hard time deciding: 
 I am looking at either Cisco C1000 or Aruba CX6000 48 and 24 port PoE switches. Supply chain is like everything else right now and lackluster at best. They are also getting pretty expensive. 
 I can find "previously loved"/refurb Aruba 2530 or Cisco 3750X 48 and 24 port PoE switches that support our requirements for about 1/5 to 1/3 of the cost from a reputable supplier. Cisco 3750X is out of support and the 2530 will be soon, so no critical vulnerability patches when/if they happen. 
 Our perimeter will be secured with either Fortigate or Palo Alto and proper segmented network design, and these switches will sit only on the access layer. 
 What I'm struggling with is justifying the HUGE jump in price to go brand new. Yes, I realize it could prevent a potential failure, but these are also Cisco and Aruba switches that will most likely last 10-15 years without issue which has been my experience with both brands. If one fails, I can stock 3 in its place and still come out ahead. 
 Curious what the consensus is on missing out on vulnerability patches on switches that are at the access layer? Judging from other threads it's a mixed bag, but thought I'd see what kind of discussion comes up! 
 Thank you!

 Tuesday, a close partner company had an email account compromised and phished us. Forty people clicked the link. Whee remediation.
 Wednesday, that new method of spreading Qakbot and similar via one note attachments sent to old email chains that bleeping computer did a story about Tuesday bit us. Junior admin released the wrong email to a user, who apparently opens everything she gets ever. This was a baaaaaaaad how in the hell do you fall for this email. "Here's what you asked for, please see the attached document" with an email thread from two years ago below it. Fortunately, Microsoft Defender caught it and quarantined after she downloaded, opened, and tried to let it download the malware. My team kicks ass, we had it contained within ten minutes of the alert, then two hours to track down what the hell happened.

 I am trying to setup a new VLAN for our IP Cameras. I'm using a combination of Ubiquiti and Aruba switches.
 Switch 1 is a Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch 48. Switch 2 is a Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch 16 XG. Switch 3 is an Aruba 1930.
 Here are the pertinent VLAN configurations:
  
 VLAN 10 IP 10.2.10.0/23 
  
 VLAN 50 IP 10.2.250.0/24 
 
 ​
 Here are the pertinent switchport configurations and notes:
  
 Switch 1 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 14 T U T T T To DHCP Server 10.2.10.2 
  Port 36 E U E E E PC gets 10.2.10.0 IP. WORKS PROPERLY 
  Port 38 E E E E U PC gets 10.2.250.0 IP. WORKS PROPERLY 
  Port 49 T U T T T To Port 1 Switch 2 
 
 ​
 ​
  
 Switch 2 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 1 T U T T T Connected to port 49 on Switch 1 
  Port 13 E E E E U PC gets 10.2.250.0 IP. WORKS PPOPERLY 
  Port 14 T U T T T Connected to port 48 on Switch 3 
 
 ​
 ​
  
 Switch 3 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 47 E E E E U Connected to PC. No IP 
  Port 48 T U T T T To Port 14 on Switch 2 
 
 ​
 The computer connected to Switch 3 port 47 does not get an IP from the DHCP server. I put Wireshark on the computer and see the DHCP Discover go out but do not see anything hit the DHCP server. If I manually assign an IP to the computer everything works fine. 
 A DHCP server relay is configured in Switch 3. 
 What am I missing?

Zendesk saying that the "internal note" when someone replies to a ticket via email is expected behavior, then pointing me to an article which isn't accurate for the problem I described at all.

This is outside of the timeline but I had an absolute hell of a time getting Zendesk to understand what a damned JSON token was. In the end we solved it on our side with no help from them at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! 
 I'm reaching out to you as I'm absolutely clueless on what is going on. 
 I'm renting a colocation in a datacenter and have a bunch of servers connected via 10G Mellanox Connect X3 cards to a mikrotik crs317 switch.
 My primary uplink is a 10G SFP+ fiber provided by my upstream provider.
 The switch is doing regular switching, no firewall or routing rules are configured. 
 I started seeing upload speed issues on all but one of the servers.
 All servers are using exactly the same NICs + DAC + OS combination. 
 When running an IPerf test to a target outside of my network the download speed is sitting somewhere between 2-10Gbit/s but the upload speed is only at around 20MBit/s to 300Mbit/s. 
 But on one of the servers it works just fine and even the upload is at 2+ Gbit/s.
 ​
 Running an iperf test on the second port of the card (which is an internal LAN) I can reach 10Gbit/s both directions just fine. 
 I don't think the issue is my equipment but on the other hand I have no explanation why it works on one of the servers.
 Is there any logical explanation? 
 Thank you so much!

 The vulnerability is outlined here : https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbswitch-session-JZAS5jnY

 Is there a way to remove their access to this computer remotely? We might not have access to run remote commands through the network to their computer (PowerShell, Command Prompt, etc.) but may be able to run similar commands through TeamViewer.

 His idea is to provide some high availability when one dns server gets down. I really don't know if it makes much sense as we can set preferred and alternative dns servers. I saw here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn593685(v=ws.11)#dns-client-resolver-behavior#dns-client-resolver-behavior) that a windows machine will take 1 second to forward the lookup to the alternative dns server, I guess a VIP will take more time to pass to the other server.
 Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I am looking for a solution to automate the process of onboarding new users (and maybe even for offboarding tasks if possible). At the moment this is the flow of tasks:
 - HR is opening a ticket with the new user's details (name, position, department, manager, mobile phone number);
 - we're creating a Office365 mailbox via the on-premise Exchange cp (it's a hybrid environment) and that creates the AD user;
 - we add the details on the user's AD profile (all of the above, they are used for dynamic group membership mostly);
 - the user is synced to AAD;
 - we assign the O365 licenses as needed.
 Obviously, there's also the task of preparing the laptop, joining it to AD and Intune and install specific apps on it, but that's another discussion I believe, right now I want to focus on the other tasks that I mentioned.
 So, any of you have some ideas on how can this be automated? I know that there are HR apps that integrate with AD and could maybe do what we need, but I have no experience on this, I wouldn't know where to begin...
 Thank you!

I find myself in a good position to be in, which is, I can choose whether to stay at my current job and possibly earn more in the following months, or switch now to a place where I'd make about 30% more. I've been at my current company for almost 5 years now, and it is my first IT job. I started as an intern in 2018, and became a full time employee in 2020. I've been job seeking for a few months now, and have refused two other offers, but this one sounds so good it's hard to not think about doing it. The thing is, I feel so bad about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm seeing a lot of posts recently about sys admins values etc, a lot of them seem to be in fairly similar boats to me (small on site teams for a few hundred users) and they're saying they're on $60k+. I'm in the UK so of course the conversion rate plays a increasingly smaller factor in that, but I earn nowhere near that.
 It's highly likely that these sys admins do a lot more than me, but it got me thinking... What do you sys admins actually do in a fairly regular day to day? I'm hoping it might give me some ideas of what I want to do/what to expect as I further my career. I wouldn't mind being on 60K either!

 My agency just mandated that we move away from the usual SCAP scanner and implement a Navy-written tool called "Eval-STIG". Eval-STIG uses answer files to provide justification for "Open" and "Not Reviewed" items, but the format of that file is bewildering to me. Rather than using previous STIG-generated checklists, it uses a custom XML file to provide those status overrides.
 Is there a document or anything that anyone can point to for me that explains the formatting and correct usage of the XML fields in that answer file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, sysadmin in training here. As title says some of my users have been functionning in a very strange way. They have a shared mailbox which they CC on every mail they send. Team of 5, huge flow of mail. The result is 16k mails in 6 months, our plan allows for 50Gb of mails and it's already full. The apparent reasoning behind this is to allow anyone to access every conversation with clients should one of them be out of the office.
 Good Idea, bad execution they think mail storage is unlimited, and they don't want to delete old mails "in case", for now I set up an automatic archive but it's really slow and they've been complaining for a few days, some have the same problem on their own adresses. They're moving the mails manually from Inbox to the archive but that's just delaying the inevitable because the archive has a 50Gb max capacity.
 How can I solve this ? Anyone ever had this kind of situation?
 Thanks a ton, been learning a lot on this subreddit already!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello There. I have a client that i have never worked with before that has asked me to advise them on modernising their IdP. They currently have a combination of Active Directory, synching to AzureAD, but using ADFS for Auth. In addition to using ADFS for 365 authentication, they are also using several other applications (box.com for example) as well as using LDAP against the on-prem for some on-prem apps.
 They are eager to move to AzureAD (or another cloud IdP) to remove dependency on On-Prem.
 My thinking is that each app that uses ADFS is going to be handled differently. And that each one needs to be "cutover", there is unlikely to be any way to stage or transition from one Identity source to another.
 For 365 and Sharepoint and other MS Apps, i plan to recommend using Staged Mode, as they have some automation and workflows that have the expected ADFS webpage hard coded into their authentication, so i will leave the identitites used there in ADFS until they are "dev'd" out.
 Staging mode should in no way affect the third party apps, am i correct?
 My method is along the lines of 
 Enable PHS in ADConnect & Seamless SSO -> Enable Staging Mode -> Migrate majority of Human Users to Staging Group (I can move the Automation Accounts as their devs update the app to support this)
 The above has no impact on the 3rd party apps, correct?
 But what about if/when i change my domain in AzureAD away from Federated to Managed? Does that impact?
 Ive been doing a lot of reading, and seen plenty of people say that they read too much into this, it ended up not being as complicated as expected. My issue is the client has a large regulated workforce that cannot accept significant downtime!

When trying to add a printer to one of the new Azure AD computers, the UAC prompt appears, I enter my Azure AD local admin credentials to allow driver install, and then after a bit, I get an "access denied" message.
 The event log shows: "The print spooler failed to import the driver that was downloaded from \\prt01\print$\x64\PCC\oemsetup.inf_amd64_a3d32de99448d391.cab into the driver store for driver 2507ci KX.

 This problem does not occur on the older on-prem AD connected computers. On them drivers are automatically downloaded from the print server and installed without issue.
 Why is the Azure AD joined computer unable to download print drivers from the print server? What do you guys think the problem could be? Any solutions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering methods to connect remotely to my iMac across the internet from an iPad Pro. Ideally I will avoid services that enable the connection via an unrestricted server (udp holepunch) even when the service is advertised as encrypted (so teamviewer, jump and even vpns are excluded).
 I prefer direct connections (ssh for terminal access and rdp for the windows but don't like the risk associated with port forwarding. My solution is to implement tcp wrapper on the server and either restrict the client access to the smallest range of IP addresses from whichever location I am at or each time I connect, restrict the IP address to my actual IP address at the time. To configure the tcp wrapper I would connect to the server using jump and then once I have configured it take down that connection and then come in directly using rdp and ssh (with access restricted to my remote IP address only). The jump “daemon” will run for 5 minutes periodically (say, once or twice an hour) so the jump connection will only be available within that window.
 In summary use the udp holepunch style services (jump, Team viewer, vpn) as a way of initialising the direct connection and as a backdoor route if I manage to lock myself out but do 99% of my connectivity directly. If I am able to restrict access to just the range of IP addresses used by whatever ISP I am coming in from, I might only have to configure tcp_wrapper once for each ISP from which I am connecting. If that isn't viable, I am cool with re-initialising each time my remote IP changes.
 I should add that all my important passwords are 16 chars in length and all have lower case, upper case, numbers and special chars so I feel fairly protected against brute force attacks.
 what do you think of this plan?
 thanks in advance.

 A year and a half ago I got saddled with snd set up a new inventory system, migrated mobile to AAD and Intune, and refreshed 500 mobile devices mostly single-handedly, then got told to hand it off instantly to the help desk. No admin status, back to 'do what you're told' development.
 One year ago I wasted most of my time teaching other teams the basics of Agile, AD, business analysis, and got told I couldn't speak to other admins over Windows and Websphere and Salesforce because 'I caused more trouble by sharing information.' They replaced our business analysts and PMs with 'product owners' they scrounged from other departments and forced into roles they don't understand, and told us not to talk to the business or face consequences.
 Five months ago I interviewed for an asset manager position for $20k more in an entirely different department, got an instant offer, and my C-Level immediately calls to offer me the same pay scale and the long-promised lead position a day later, provided they put the job up for anyone to apply to. I explained I had an outside offer for double what I was just offered (but with way fewer benefits and leeway).
 I played hardball in 2022-2023, management got scared about losing me, and I finally got the job.

I have a CCNA and some previous exp. but Im no seasoned veteran or anything. I was told to document everything for an audit. When I get there, though, all the IT guy would let me do is take pictures/notes and would only give me the password to the guest wifi. I said this isnt enough for me to do the audit and he just kind of shrugged. His boss is gonna be pissed though when all i provide them is a rack diagram and a port map. They should've given me access to the corporate network if they want a full audit right? Im anxious the IT guy is gonna point the finger at me and say he gave me access to the server room so that should've been good enough or something.

The content will be available through Internet but only to those authenticated users. Currently we have an apache httpd with basic auth, and a ftp for users to upload the content to that httpd server. It's pretty archaic. Do you know any opensource tool that can deliver same thing but more friendly? I'm not looking for a cms, it's just to upload preexisting web content from different sources to a place where it can be published.

 I will move to IPv6, though I find the technical merits insufficient.

 This issue is not the idea of IPv6 (bigger addresses, security, mobility, etc.); It's IPv6 itself. I would move, if I got something better than IPv6.

 The son-in-law VP of Operations asked my new employer on getting a proposal together to see what it would take to keep them humming. Hopefully everyone wins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to apologize at the start if my question is overly simple. I'm self-taught in SQL and Server admin, and the guy that had previously setup the network I'm working on is out on medical leave (not expected back before go-live). 
 We're a small company, that recently decided to open a second location several states away from our current. Our current network is a 10.10.x/23 setup, with 1-79 reserved for static devices (servers, switches, printers, network connected manufacturing devices), and the rest as DHCP for internal and guest networks. We're very close to our 512 address limit. Our new location is expected to roughly need 20 more static addresses, and peak around 100 DHCP between internal and guest. My initial thought was to use the same DHCP host, expand the subnet to a 10.10.x/21, block of a larger range for statics, and expand DHCP range for the rest. 
 However, I get the impression that I can create the 2nd location network as it's own 10.10.x/24 range, and use DHCP Relay to enable communication without having to rework all of the local stuff. That should just require some changes to the initial DHCP, and DNS, but otherwise will all be configurable on the Firewall at location2?
 ​
 So in things needing adjusted in Loc1 (ex. 10.10.100/23)
 -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)
 -DHCP Host
 -DNS Host
 -rest of the network is no-change
 Loc2 (ex 10.10.200/23)
 -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)
 -rest of the network is nothing extra to setup
 ​
 Is this best practice? What other things do I need to be planning for and configuring before shipping the firewall and switches across the country?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. 
 I am bit baffled... I am doing some troubleshooting between my load balancer and backend server. When I perform a 'curl' from the load balancer, the load balancer sees "SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK" and then of course starts to push data. The server sees "SYN, SYN-ACK, but no ACK. It then does a retransmit of the SYN-ACK packets, and then gives up and sends a Reset. We do have a firewall in between, and although these two are in the same subnet (should just be switched) we see it hitting (the L3 gateways are configured on the firewall, so this might be expected). 
 What's more interesting, is I would think the LB should receive the reset and stop the data. It keeps sending, for a few seconds after the server had (suppposedly) reset the connection. 
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: After reading some replies, I want to clarify. By "support" I mean exclusively networking. My first "helpdesk" job I was in Wireshark picking apart VoIP call flows along with troubleshooting everything under layer 7 on a service provider network.
 In interviews they always press what feels like "so...what have you actually done...". I have never physically touched a piece of equipment outside of a lab, designed anything, or had any major projects.
 I feel like I need to take a step back before I can advance. I dont mind taking a pay cut. But what roles should I shoot for? Junior, Associate, Mid level? I even see senior roles that look doable.
 Note: I said in the title "near CCNP level". I would not be able to pass the CCNP at this time. I am not asking about certification, though. What I mean by that is I hold and am beyond CCNA in terms of being valuable in troubleshooting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: What IT position routinely uses packet capture, wireshark, and other tools to solve problems?
 Here's the scenario: the company runs a public facing website for customers to HTTP POST order data. This endpoint is restricted in the firewall to a known Allowlist of customer FQDN and IP addresses. 
 Orders from a particular customer stopped flowing this week. We reached out to the customer Tech Support for assistance, no response. After a backlog of about $200,000 worth of purchase orders had stacked up, I dug in.
 I knew that the customer's app was trying to make a connection and assumed they were hitting us from an unknown and disallowed IP address. Using Packet Capture and wireshark, I was able to sift though all of the Scans, bots, and other nasty traffic and ended up correlating inbound dropped packets to outbound confirmation requests (from other TCP streams initiated by us). The source and destination IPs were different, but both in Google Cloud.
 I took an educated guess and whitelisted an unknown IP Address and the orders started flowing again.
 Turns out the customer had migrated their services to Google Cloud and had not informed their downstream vendors of the change. 
 I love this detective work, using wireshark to solve these kinds of mysteries and investigating what is otherwise "invisible".
 I'm a generalist - a mile wide and an inch deep but have recently developed a strong desire to specialize in networking or Cyber. Based on the Task Description above, what IT Job Title does this kind of work routinely?

 A director has spent of time on Google and asking people about networking and is now convinced that this new office can easily be hooked up by simply adding a managed switch, directly connected to all desktops that will be in the office. This switch would have one wire feeding back to the main building (less than 100 metres) and feed into one port one of the current switches. 
 I have explained that this just isn't a good idea at all and that it would offer single point of failure, it likely won't be able to take the strain and a few other reasons.
 What reasons would you list to explain that this is a really bad idea?

 I'm a pro-AV engineer and we're looking to standardize on UPS units. We've been with TrippLite for decades, primarily using their SmartPro line of 1U units. They were inexpensive, and held up for the most part. 
 TrippLite is no longer selling to us direct as they are part of EATON now. and sales is through distribution like everyone else. This is fine, but with that costs go up. 
 But what about other brands? I see tons out there now and just don't have experience with anything other than TrippLite and APC (now part of Schneider). 
 I've installed a couple CyberPower units, and the first one I got failed in the first week. They RMA'd it and covered return shipping, but it meant a 4 hour drive to swap and swap back.. The replacement just failed again after 18 months (if that). 
 Middle Atlantic units seem expensive. 
 What's the verdict on Vertiv? I've seen them more than once in the wild recently. 
 Anything else I should look into?

 Recently got a job as a Jr. Network Admin where we own multiple locations that have several ISPs. Currently most locations have 2 routers, one for each ISP in use, both connected to a managed switch.
 I’ve been tasked with figuring out how to access the 2nd router directly through the web UI, as currently we can access router 1 over its web UI, but can only access the 2nd router through SSH after first using SSH to access the 1st router. What would be the cause for being able to access the 2nd router this way, but not directly through the web UI? Any tips on how I can make this possible or what to check on? I’ve tried finding documentation or anyone with a similar situation and haven’t found anything, and now I’m at a loss for what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 for a project I want to fetch various information about switches using NETCONF. For this, I use ncclient (a python Library).
 From what I understood, capabilities are describing which information can be queried/configured on the device using NETCONF.
 When asking for capabilities, I get an answer which includes
  
urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system?revision=2014-08-06&module=ietf-system&feature=radius,authentication,ntp,ntp-udp-port
  
This looks promising, as I want to fetch the currently configured NTP Server. Checking the data model I would expect to be able to use a filter like this:
 <filter type="subtree"> <system xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system"> </system> </filter> 
 I followed the YANG model for ietf-system from here.
 I was expecting that a device which claims to have such a capability would then also allow me to read it. However, the docs for the device just mention setting it via NETCONF.
 Now I wonder:
  
did the manufacturer of the device not follow the NETCONF standard?
 
does "being able to configure it" also mean that I should be able to read it?
 
or am I doing something completely wrong here?
 
 Getting all interfaces (from urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces) seems to work as expected, but for ietf-system I get just an empty <data/> field back...

So I have redundant IPS and firewalls (Meraki) in each office and I set up the IPS in an active-passive state for failover. However, during a recent network incident where my primary circuit experienced 10% packet loss for a short time, The wan circuit did not fail over (Expected behavior for meraki FW Possible to take up to five minutes). causing some users to be unable to access certain services for three minutes. I know that i cant control the internet so once it leaves my firewall its outa my hands but Having the ability to show that it's out on the Internet Via a dashboard is nice.
 I currently use 1000 Eyes with Enterprise agents and endpoint agents for monitoring, but these tests only run every five minutes and may not be the best solution for my organization's needs. (I could increase the resolution of the tests, but the tests incur licensing costs) Right now, with 1000 eyes, I'm tracking the availability of Google's DNS, then my three main SAS applications, and local network gateway. Additionally, while the Meraki dashboard provides information it is limited and only tracks The network device's ability to communicate to meraki, and not able to track access to services.
 I am considering alternative solutions such as PingDom to track WAN availability by pinging virtual IPs and reporting on SLA. Another option is to spin up a service in Azure, where I have virtual networks with tunnels to each site. By testing communication through these tunnels, I can monitor the ability to reach the Internet and end-point devices. but not Necessarily, the network's ability to communicate to my Saas endpoints.
 I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or ideas for the best solution to monitor my network's ability to communicate with the outside world.

 got a job offer for 100k, probably around 10k "extra" per year in bonus and stock options. seems like a job i would enjoy at a huge company with lots of job opportunity and its work from home 2 days per week, but there are 2 big negatives...
 it would be a 1 hour commute (each way), but only 3 days per week, AND the other big negative is that its a 4 month rotating schedule of first and second shift. so 4 months first shift (7AM-4PM), then 4 months second shift (4PM-midnight).
 ​
 what would you do??? 
 ​
 EDIT: im 25 with only 2 years work experience in IT since graduation. at a small company literally impossible for IT job growth. This other company is a fortune 500 tech company
 RE-EDIT: wow, lots of differing opinions. If anyone is wondering. I'm 25 with no wife, kids, or responsibilities. I even live at home with my parents still so it would all be profit lol. Not sure if that changes anything

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so we are working on a deployment plan for Microsoft Laps across several environments and I'm looking into some of the timing questions. I've looked over the documentation and the overall setup/etc doesn't look too bad and we will run this through lab/pilot groups of course. 
 My questions is, is there any downside to predeploying the laps client (prior to schema changes/etc)? Getting the client out is easy enough (deployment solution)... but like everywhere else in the last two years our workforce has scattered across the country lol. The deployment could take a week or two to complete and for some units we may want to be a bit more aggressive on the timeline to rollout.
 Also, any thoughts on this being deployed for servers? Again... this seems pretty strait forward assuming avoiding things like domain controllers/etc. Any other big gotchas we should be looking for/might see?
 Should have added...most of our environments are fairly simple domains but some are wide spread. In any case, I appreciate any thoughts or insights into this (even beyond what is mentioned). In any case thanks for your time if you got this far :)

I checked it out and it was just the lifters on the oscillating vent, but since we don't have a service contract on it and we've been in budget crunch for a few months now I just put off looking at it for another day.
 Came in this morning and the clunking sound is gone. So - as of this moment, the AC unit is both working ("alive") AND not working ("dead") until of course I open the door. Logically speaking I don't need to look at it - right? LOL.
 All kidding aside, the iDRAC controllers on the Dell r730xd's haven't thrown a temperature error /yet/ so I know it's still working. However, I know they're going to ask me to McGyver the hell out of that unit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks!
 I'm currently on a bit of a side quest for my IT team to explore the viability of shifting most of our org over to Google Meet to save some costs from Zoom. I can find plenty of pros and cons online about the general features and performance of each platform but I have a very specific concern about this potential switch over and that is the control and admin of the cloud recordings, let me explain.
 Zoom has a wonderful admin interface that allows us to see all cloud recordings in one place, this is used mainly in our Sales department. It is especially helpful when a user leaves the business, we are able to transfer all their Zoom cloud recordings to their line manager as we delete their Zoom account with ease.
 Google Meet seems to have a very bare bones approach to Meeting recordings. By default it will just save a recording to the meeting hosts Gdrive and that's it, no option to transfer to another user (i.e their manager) and no centralised control over these recordings.
 ​
 Am I totally seeing this wrong or is Zoom the clear winner in recording management with the meetings and calls?

 We have several iPads / iPads mini's, and I have several files I want to share with these iPads. Then simply open them with an app that is deployed on the iPads.
 We're using Lightspeed MDM. I don't like it. But it's what we got. I've looked all over the administration pages, can't find anything. Neither in their documentation. I would have thought sharing files would have been a more needed feature? 
 Anyway. Any advice? My idea was just to sign into a icloud on every device, but icloud seems to be blocked. Tried to change some settings to see if I could unblock it, but no luck so far.

 Environment - separate networks/NIC's, external switch not sharing management, different vlan. Hosts are on small isolated network while VM's are for intranet.
 Any tips on making it more secure? Shielded VM's are opposite what we are looking for as these seems to secure VM's from rogue Admins so doesn't look like that is an option.
 As far as I can find at the minute it looks like the only way to hop between VM and Host are Microsoft vulnerabilities, please correct me if I'm wrong.
 Else, PowerShell Direct, while I do use it I never had a concern connecting 2 different environments together, any concerns here? Or again it would come down to vulnerabilities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I'm working with a client that prefers to create independent shared mailboxes for every shared CALENDAR they would like added. Sometimes these calendars are created in the user's account and shared out. 
 I'd rather create them under one shared mailbox like "Finance" and have multiple calendars underneath and shared out so they can be centrally managed. Creating multiple shared calendars under a shared mailbox can be done in OWA. I'm finding this is difficult to manage, however, and these calendars cannot then be located in the GAL so I suppose an invite is required. This is AFTER granting the user full delegation to the shared mailbox and still finding the calendar is not visible in outlook 365 client... But it exists in OWA. 
 How does everyone manage shared calendars without creating a ton of shared mailboxes?

 I've made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications, aimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host their infrastructure. Because today lines are kinda blurred between sysadmin and DevOps I'm posting this here too hoping someone might find it useful.
 To get this out of the way - this course doesn't cover Kubernetes or similar - I'm of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals, you probably don't need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.
 As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We were staging our Fortigate HA firewalls for migration and had to perform an upgrade to the latest code 7.2.4. Before performing the upgrade we forgot to disable the NAT rules on the Fortigate which were running parallel with Palo Alto firewalls. 
 During the upgrade firewalls failed over and the ARP table on our ISP gateway got updated with new ARP entries from Fortigate (GARP sent during HA failover). And users lost access to some of the servers NAT'ed on outside. Since we don't have access to the ISP gateway to clear ARP cache, we needed to contact the ISP support, unfortunately no one responded in a timely manner.
 So the situation is that we need to wait till the arp timer expires in the ISP gateway and we don't know how long it takes and we cannot afford a long outage. So we had to fix this issue asap without performing a failover or any changes in Palo Alto to trigger GARP. 
 Then we found this command  test arp gratuitous ip <ip/netmask> interface <interface name>  which would manually trigger a GARP and it saved our day. It updated the upstream ISP gateway ARP tables. I know that we could do this in Cisco ASA and Firepower but wasn't aware that this is available in Palo. I think there is no such command available in Fortigate to manually force GARP (but I think we can set a timer for GARP in the vip).
 Sharing this as it might come handy for someone who ends up in the same situation as we were.

It’s a bit of a mess, I’m about to put a bit of cable management in to tidy it up, but see the server is inside the cabinet sideways with quite limited air flow. I’m looking to see how I can improve things a little. 
 I have a fan blowing air out of there which definitely helps cool the area. Generally if it’s a warm day I’ll have the air con on as well, the server fans will kick in if it gets too warm. Sounds like a jet taking off, lol. 
 It’s a HP DL380 if that makes any difference. 
 Would I be best to lift it slightly off the shelf to allow air flow underneath?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm in the planning phase of rolling out an OS upgrade (from Windows 7, sigh) for a small business.
 I've been talking to the software manifacturer company about the latest suggested requisites and they told me to go with either Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise or Windows Server 2019 (not sure if 2022 would work as well).
 The thing is that the software is multi-user using RDP. They suggested, instead of acquiring CAL licenses, to buy an RDP server implementation from another vendor (TSplus, never heard of that before) which is supposedly cheaper.
 That made me wonder if there are other alternatives (possibly an open source implementation of the RDP protocol). Windows Server is not really my thing (and it would run inside an hypervisor) and that's why I'm asking here.
 Thank you in advance.

 OneLogin customer here....
 I was wondering if you can still setup Conditional Access with OneLogin and Microsoft, if OneLogin handles all of the authentication requests.
 Currently when a login is entered at 365, it redirects back to OneLogin.
 If Conditional Access is configured (e.g. for outside the country) - would it still kick in regardless of the redirect?
 I don't believe OneLogin has this feature, so curious to know if anybody has set this up, and is it still possible?

 I've used the InstallSheild response recording function and that does work to create a replayable install. However...
 As part of the install it takes credentials (passwords) for some initial user accounts that it will create. I'd like to template the response file automation so that I can supply different credentials for these accounts during the build.
 The response file records these passwords as strings of the form !CRYPT!XXXXXXX... or !CRYPTEX!XXXXXXX... (where XXXXXXX is a long sequence of numbers).
 These data items could either be recording a hash of the password data, or could be reversible encryption of the actual password itself.
 I'm assuming these items are using a standard InstallSheild function to generate the values and handle the encryption/decryption required.
 Does anyone have any information on what this encryption implementation is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the past couple of weeks, we've been having random power cuts, after the first one, we noticed that the majority of our machines would stop loading any web pages for up to 30 seconds or so and then work again, but completely randomly, never all at the same time.
 ​
 consistent ping/tracert would run but pages would still not load. so clearly a DNS issue.
 ​
 Check the DNS logs and find that we would get SERVFAIL (2) errors, doing a packet capture would also show the same thing.
 ​
 We have DNS on a DC and all our machines point to that server for DNS, we also have another site with a second DC and almost identical site setup and they doesn't have this issue.
 ​
 We changed the forwarders to use our ISP's DNS servers instead of 8.8.8.8/4.4 , 1.1.1.1 etc in case we were swamping them with DNS requests, we have a lot of devices on our network so thought it could be a problem. Alas, still have the issue.
 ​
 We originally thought it was a Meraki switch that was causing routing issues, but it has been disconnected and the problem still remains.
 ​
 the DC with the issue seems to behave differently to the other DC as well, If I ping the DC hostname from the DC it will return ::1 where as the second DC responds with the correct v4 address. A bit of a google has suggested changing ipv4 preference over IPv6, but not sure if this is going to make much of a difference. waiting on a good time to reboot the server for the regkey to take effect.
 ​
 It could be the firewall, though I cant see anything in the logs for any DNS requests that are being denied.
 ​
 any suggestions on what the issue might be or where you might look next?

 ​
 As you know AS2 uses PKI to send/receive files securely.
 When it's time to renew the private key, you send your public key to your partners. That part is clear. 
 But who decides the actual point in time when the switchover from old to new occurs ? AS2 uses a 1:N relation, you have 1 private key for n partner relations, so switchover should be done in concert.
 But looking at my AS2 server (mendelson) it appears not to "try" to use its new key when a partner sends a file using our new public key. It knows both its old and new keys.
 Is this some RFC all AS2 implementation suffer from or just un-user-friendly implementation ?
 I have a hard time believing I have to send a precise date/time to all my AS2 partners to make switchover successfull ?
 ​

Just called our printer vendor, asked for direct replacement as I don't know too much about this I relied on their knowledge but I am starting to think it was a mistake, not sure still, maybe you guys can help.
 So issue is the printouts are smaller. They are good quality, not cropped, just downsized ~30% centered in the middle. This is a packing station, we print over network directly from SAP spooler, labels are .pdf.
 I tried everything humanly possible from direct import of the config file from other zebras to side by side going through both internal config utility and ZSU, gave it an hour or two of tinkering and then gave up (ultimately, barcode so it's usable it just looks funny and bit hard to read).
 So the main difference what I found was printer resolution. Old was 203dpi, new is 300dpi. I couldnt find any up/downscaling settings in neither of setup utilities.
 Is dpi the problem here and if so, is there any trick to upscale printouts with zebra label printers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have switches connected together via trunk link. It was working until yesterday. I console into the switch and found the trunk link to be in err-disable, so I shut and unshut the port. The state changed to connected, and still no traffic getting through.
 The trunk that was working was 10G MMF fiber. I could still see the other switch via CDP, but no traffic getting through. I changed the SFP+ on both ends, and I was able to ping the other switch, but it was really bad. When I sent 100 pings to the other switch, it would timeout at random intervals. 80/100 success rate. The trunk link is at 10G full-duplex on both ends. 
 I tried 1G SFP, and still no dice. The 1G SFP MMF states were down down. So I went back to SFP+.
 I swapped the fiber from orange to aqua, and it was worse. With aqua fiber, there is no traffic at all, but CDP is working. I changed ports and still no traffic. I swapped to copper, and the same - CDP is working, but no traffic getting through. 
 The config on each port is the same. Upstream Switch (i think it is a 3850):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 nonegotiation  Downstream Switch (I think it is a 3750):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q nonegotiation  This whole time the 3850 led was green, but the 3750 was amber. Again, each link shows 10Gbps at full-duplex. I have rebooted both switches and only CDP is working. I'm hitting a wall at this point. What else could I do to troubleshoot this trunk link?

 I've been posting here before about an MLAG setup I did and I have some more questions.
 So I have an MLAG topology, see https://imgur.com/dRFkzAJ 
 The setup is:
  
Two fortigate firewalls in HA mode, A/P. I run LACP on two ports, port 1 and port 2.
 Two NK9 switches are vPC pairs.
 The switches are pure layer 2, we run only layer 2 on the switches (only L2 VLANs). All the default gateways are configured in the firewalls.
 Internet terminated in the switches. I do NOT have two ISPs, it is only one ISP that provides us two circuits or two handoffs that terminates on my both switches. They (the ISP) run VRRP on the router so my internet next-hop or default gateway is the VIP. Basically, the internet connection (setup) is a QinQ where they handoff two transport VLANs.
  
The MLAG…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit! This is a question for all you experienced sysAdmins.
 I am planning a on-premise server setup and have a question mainly about user management. This is for a future production environment. I am taking the sysadmin role in a small company and I originally learned computer sciences with a focus on application development, so while I know the basics I am missing a lot of experience with implementing servers. 
 What I want to do:
 I'll have a central Ubuntu server that runs as a NAS and possibly run VMs for workloads (simulations, renders and a database). I need to manage permissions for user groups and individual users. I also want access via VPN for homeoffice users and would like to manage a universal login for every user (would be perfect to be able to import these) and not have several logins. 
 I am aware of Windows Active Directory but since I decided not to bother with Windows as my server OS (mainly because of licensing and compatible database software) I want to do that on a Linux Server. 
 Basically I want to manage access so that only specific groups of users or specific users can access certain folders, thats the most important thing right now. There are aproximately 30 users but the number will grow in the future. Clients are all using Windows and if I could use the windows login as authentication for server access that would be perfect.
 Its my first time planning a complex server setup from scratch with user management, but I want it to be well plannned and documented, so any help and advice would be appreciated. I am open to suggestions about the general server or network architecture and the software I'll use, but my Hardware needs to at least host a NAS, a DBMS and ideally a VM.
 Please let me know if anny more information is necessary and thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 Here is a drawing of the setup: https://imgur.com/6iIYJ2Y
 Can someone please advise. We're installing a solar system at a client. Our solar network needs to communicate to 192.168.0.100 to get data from their existing electrical infrastructure. Their 192.168.0.100 is not connected to the internet due to security reasons, it's literally got an unmnaged switch with no router even, we are allowed though to connect onto that network as long as their computer doesn't have any internet access. Secondly, we've got a TV in the entrance of the building displaying data from the solar for the clients to see, it's almost a 800m run so would rather want to utilise and try to work through their existing network, running a new cable is very hard due to access.
 I please need assistance on how to get traffic from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.5 without interfering with their existing network (not sure if it's called port forwarding?). Client has a network engineer on site but I'm getting the feeling he's not 100% sure how as nothing has been actioned yet, I can hopefully relay info from here to him and see if he finds a way.
 Then I please need assistance on how to get traffic to and from 192.168.0.100 from 192.168.2.2 , is it perhaps port forwarding on the Teltonika and Cisco side? And then setting up a firewall rule on the cisco side to not give internet access to 192.168.2.2?
 I can, going to be hard though, run a seperate cable from the Teltonika straight to the 192.168.0.100 network and then the 192.168.0.100 network is not going to be connected to the Cisco network at all, but then I'll need advise on how to set up on the Teltonika side to not give internet to 192.168.0.100 but still be able to access it.
 Thanks in advance for any assistance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 20 years in IT, with increasing responsibility but still doing end user support, I'm not firmly in a senior sysadmin role on an infrastructure operations team. We're moving a government org into M365 and maintaining and upgrading other server infrastructure stuff, and it is sooooo nice having two levels of IT helpdesk BEFORE tickets get to me!
 Also, there's a bit of fear looking at new systems I am now responsible for running (Airwatch, eDiscovery and Purview, Security, etc), but then super fun getting to dive in, learn the magic isn't inscrutable, show my ability to pick stuff up quickly and contribute, share the load with my awesome, and very-much-more-experienced-in-many-ways team, and they clearly appreciate the value I'm bringing, even as a totally new person to their org and team.
 Not knocking my prior gigs. They were good, the teams were good, we did good work together. This is not a whole 'nother level from what I've done before, but I'm not out of my depth, it's just a bigger challenge and I'm having loads of fun in an environment that seems to really want its members to succeed.
 Also today I helped in my first real security remediation, and using Security and Purview audit logs I was able to piece together the critical info showing how the email made it to an inbox, and confirmed what data we need to do that so much more quickly next time. So I might be riding a bit of a high.
 Anyway, if you read this far, thanks. New job good, this day good. All good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently have a cradlepoint to connect some remote equipment back to AWS cloud. It works okay but not really a fan of the UI and the subscriptions are getting expensive. I realize there is a hardware + software piece here. I'm okay with putting together my own hardware - just need a good software solution. I've done a bit of research - but haven't found anything that sticks out as a clear winner.
 ​
 Key Needs:
  
Robust change management (file based so it's git compatible)
 Tolerant of minor config errors so we can still get in to rollback changes (similar to how netcloud w/cradlepoint works as this will be at remote sites)
 Easy button to VPN connect a local network (OpenVPN, wireguard, etc)
 Management of local WiFi interfaces on the device
 Management of backhaul (4G/5G) modems on the device
 Preferably no need to ever login to it - can do everything by pushing config somehow (centrally managed).
 Prefer something that can be installed on ARM, but X86 is also fine.
 Centralized logging/reporting
  
​
 Basically I'm looking for something that is always reachable via 4G/5G modems (assuming the network is up w/valid service of course) - and allows remote configuration of WiFi APs and VPN backhaul of locally attached devices.

 Thank you.

 The amount of negative posts though can likely turn off people looking change their career or enter the workforce from considering this as an enjoyable career choice. I find it to be very leisurely with rare moments of frustration or stress.
 Maybe it would be good to have flair specifically for sharing a good change or policy that has been implemented at your work, or how you were able to find that one person with vendor support who was able to solve the problem you’ve been dealing with for months.
 Alternatively there could just be a weekly recurring thread that just contains positive anecdotes.

 So, our git instances are VERY out of date. We're playing catch up on updates right now. It happens.
 Two weeks ago I announced my upcoming maintenance. I brought it up every day at least in passing to announce it. Explained it is going to take me nearly 3-4 hours to complete. It's just how it is. I told my teammates to let their pods know that I'm going to be doing this. I was very clear. However, an emergency happened and my coworker assured me they would have it done quickly so it didn't hold me back....
 Maintenance was supposed to start at 8 pm. 8:30 the pm they work with contacts me asking where they are. I don't know. I offered to do the maintenance for them so it doesn't slow me down. They declined saying that the person will be there soon.
 8:45 they show up. I send them a message telling them to let me know once they're done so I can get started. 9:45 rolls around and nothing. I assume it's going bad so I offered to help. Nothing. I contact the pm. Nothing. I wait a few more minutes then get a message from the pm saying they've been done for a little while ago and he's surprised no one told me.
 It's now 10 pm. I've got a long maintenance to complete... And I'm the Early Morning team (I start at 7 am)
 Thanks. Really. I didn't want to sleep anyway.

 Any advice or equipment do you recommend
 Case- Will be a Pelican Case maybe the 1525 or 1535. 
 Router/Switch Need help with this the most. I'm looking for the following specs if possible. Most important on top.
 - Compact 4/8port that fits in a case that wont generate too much heat
 - Fast start up
 - ipsec/vpn back to edge server
 - PoE+ for the AP but maybe i will just use a POE injector in the case
 Power- PDU with 4 outlets or 3?
 WiFi AP's- I have these already
 Connectivity will be from the portable hotspot on a Carrier SIM with an ethernet connection to the router/switch. I was thinking of getting a router/switch with built in support for carrier sim's but the cost is just crazy
 There's two ways the first one is the easiest but the least secure. But i'm looking to build both solutions 
 1) ATT Mobile portable hotspot as wan to a router/switch and the WiFI ap will connect to that. All management is done via the cloud. Easiest to setup but all traffic will be on ATT network
 2) Att mobile portable hotspot as wan to a router/switch that has ipsec back to our network so the WiFi ap will be on our network and we have internal monitoring tools and all traffic will be going through our firewall and filter.

 just wondering what you guys driving for a laptop on a daily base. I am looking for a new one so maybe I can get some inspiration.
 I am working in IT - Server management
 currently got a Lenovo t14 from work with their image so its not my personal one. looking for a windows machine with bright display and maximum 2560px resolution, bc too much is bad for battery. life. I want to be able to work a whole day. I know that's not possible but maybe there is a laptop for 8h use with simple tasks like surfing and doin ssh. Also important for me is the performance. I want desktop class performance when I need it for adobe e. g. and want to be able to turn off the GPU and use the CPU integrated one for maximum battery life... might need to write a script for that^^ Screen size between 14 and 16 inch. 14 inch is a bit to small for me but would work.
 ​
 Looking into getting the X1 Extreme from Lenovo.
 What are you guys running and in which use case? What are you looking for when choosing a laptop? What are features you need? (RJ45, HDMI, ...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original post: Link
 I decided to do myself and this sub a solid and do a legit interview with this company on my Friday afternoon.
 HR and the IT manager both had cameras off the whole time, and the IT guy proceeds to describe their environment to me. He says they have over 400 employees, but “only about half” have accounts and/or computers. Patches and backups are automated, you rarely need to be there after hours, etc. So overall, maybe it isn’t on fire?
 Either way I received notice that I was not selected, maybe since I was firm with my asking amount. All for the best, I suppose, since I found out the IT guy is related to the owner, after reading about some of their current and past lawsuits online…also, they asked several times if I was currently employed, which is obvious that I am, and that seemed like a red flag to me.
 Stay picky out there!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little over a year ago we got a new CIO. We have only had one CIO during the entire existence of my employer’s existence so this was all new to everyone. We hired someone from out of state who has previously worked as IT director for a company about 5x our size. We are a medium sized company with about 5,000 employees worldwide. Up until recently everything has been business as usual with no significant changes. 
 Today I heard that a company called TCS will start supplementing our work to help complete projects and handle day-to-day support. It was explained to us that this will allow us to drive more strategic concepts and leave support. 
 My boss scheduled a meeting with me for next week to go over the SOW and the SOW was attached to the meeting. I looked it over and it consists of several different areas (servers, databases, VMWare). These are my key competencies. 
 TCS is quoting a yearly cost that is half of my salary.
 I asked my boss why my areas of expertise are subject and it was simply reiterated that I should focus on strategic work and let TCS handle the daily and we will talk more in the meeting next week.
 I feel like I may be in the chopping block but maybe I’m looking into it. Does anybody have any experience with this type of situation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm curious to see where the rest of you sit on this.
 I firmly believe that if you don't participate in these things and push vendors to be better then they never will be.
 But I've also got enough shit on my plate that I can't afford to waste my time answering nonsense questions with TAC or whatever, and I don't owe the vendors one half of one fuck.
 How about y'all? For example: I've got a batch of PA Firewalls that insist on doing panorama connectivity checks after I change the management IP (a fine idea)... but they start doing these checks before the new IP has actually been applied (a deeply stupid idea) resulting in those checks of course failing and config reverting, even with several retries configured. This is confirmed with ping and ARP.
 So obviously a bug, but also there's a dumb but effective workaround of "just tell the firewalls to retry EVEN MORE times, hur hur". Would you invest your time in reporting it to the vendor?

 Neither of us has much experience with these above the small business level, what solutions do you all use? What features should I be looking for? We're probably looking at 4-6 sites, with 2-8 devices at each site that we'd want to access.

I have been tasked with upgrading the dated FI 6248’s on this network I am on. What I am looking for, is some type of upgrade guide on which parts should be upgraded first. Like, chassis => iom => blade? Or opposite? Mix? Or it doesn’t matter?
 I have looked online and I have been unable to find anything. Is this one of those “ancient networking secrets”? Or is that I am just a terrible googler(is that even a term??) 
 This is my first time having to perform an upgrade on the FIs, as the VM guys usually handles that. But, since there are no VM guys, well, you get the idea. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

 management api http-commands no shutdown 
 This automatically enables the API to listen on every layer 3 interface on the switch... EXCEPT Management1. This is problematic, because we use the IPs of the Management1 interfaces for DNS across all of our TOR switches, and using a spreadsheet just isn't acceptable in my environment. 
 Does anyone know a way to enable the API on a management interface? Is it even possible? I'm going open a case with Arista to ask about it, but figured I would also try you fine folks too.

 My ISP has suggested that I enable flow control on my switch, but my 10G link shouldn't be getting anything over 1G since that's what it has further upstream and downstream, right? Would flow control really do anything in this setup?

 The vendor is giving them a choice on how to earth the keystone panels. Their recommended option is to drill a hole on the floor and drive a rod into the earth in the computer room and bond all of the keystones to that. This coincidently is the most expensive solution.
 Their next best option is to simply run a heavy copper ground wire from the electrical system ground to each rack and bond the keystones to that. They say this will work, but is still vulnerable to problems.
 Option #1 seems like way overkill to me. 
 I'm suggesting that they not go with shielded cable, but in case they decide shielded, what recommendation do I give them about grounding options?

 There's been a lot of grumbling about this, and we're now being pushed to allow this functionality again. How have you gods of admins been securing your exchange access, while allowing users to use native email clients or outlook on devices outside the internal network?
 Any best practices or recommendations would be greatly appreciated :)
 ​
 EDIT: WOW thank you all for the super useful tips, I'm going to go through some of the options like DUO and see if they will suit, or propose Certificates again through foriauth, I really appreciate everyone's feedback and lots of good info to dig through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I received an email from my FS account manager this morning indicating that in the past year Microsoft has been purchasing FS equipment because Dell has failed to meet delivery commitments. 
 I know a lot of the users I've talked to on this subreddit have been weary of utilizing FS equipment. (Some due to TAA concerns, some due to OS concerns. (FSOS / ONIE), etc)
 But this is a pretty big move that will legitimize FS beyond just optics. I personally swapped my production stack from Cisco to FS around 2 years ago, it was an easy transition and has been rock solid ever since. They never have issues with inventory, I've received my orders within days, and support while a little lackluster due to some obvious language barriers is pretty responsive.
 I'm curious if this triggers any others to take the plunge on FS now. I'm also curious to see how FS handles the demand, if their supply is able to stay consistent, it could be a real game changer since Dell/HP/Cisco/Juniper lead times have been abysmal.

 we are installing a dHCI system from a client, and I'm trying to figure out what transceivers I need to order in order to provide uplink from the dHCI switches (HPE SN2010M - Basically a Mellanox rebrand) to the client's ToR switch in that cabinet which is a Juniper EX4600.
 According to HPE, the only available Xciever I have available which is 40G SR is the "HPE M-series 40GbE QSFP28 SR4 100m Transceiver" with SKU Q7F11A.
 The appropriate transceiver on the Juniper side is QFX-QSFP-40G-SR4.
 This is where I'm lost, the Juniper site clearly states that the transceiver lister above is MPO-12, but HPE simply says MPO - I can't figure out if it's MPO-12 in which case I need a simple MPO-12 cable or of the HPE Transceiver is an MPO-8 one in which case I'm not sure which cable to use because I can't find an MPO-8 Transceiver that is compatible with the Juniper EX4600. Help me, please!

How many times have I sat in a DevOps interview to be told I was the only candidate with basic networking knowledge, it's mind-boggling. Hell, a lot of people can't even produce a CV that's worth a dime.
 Kids can't use computers, and it's only getting worse, while more and more higher- and higher-level skills are required to figure out your way through all the different abstractions and counting.
 How is this ever going to work in the long-term? We need more skills to maintain the infrastructure, but we have a less and less IT-literate population, from smart people at dumb terminals to dumb people on smart terminals.
 It's going to come crashing down, isn't it? Either that, or AI gets smart enough to fix and maintain itself.
 Please tell me I'm not alone with these thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company merged with another one and we've been running two separate offices connected by IPSEC VPN. Windows domains with a two-way trust. The two buildings can currently talk to each other's devices as things stand today. Now I've been asked to move some (but not all) of the equipment from one office to another: VMware Host, NetApp and the ESXI switch stack. I can do basic switch configuration, trunks and vlans and whatnot but networking isn't my strong point. I know enough to hurt myself on the sharp edges. What I'm wondering is: 
 If the Core Switch (lets say its 10.1.1.1) is at Building A, if I move the ESXI switch (10.1.1.2) to the other building, is it possible for me to keep it on the 10.1.1.0 network and pass through Building B's core switch with vlans and static routing (Building B is on, say, 10.50.0.0 network) and across the VPN to talk to other 10.1.1.0 resources, or is it going to be easier to re-IP everything I am moving over and let the existing routing handle it? We're trying not to do that because a lot of their network shortcuts the users have are coded to the IPs and not DNS names. Which is silly, yes, I know. 
 Looking for advice as to what the "best" thing to do would be. And yes, I realize that hiring a networking professional is the Best thing to do, but there is no money in the budget for that. I'm going to have to figure this one out. And of course, they want it done this weekend.
 Thanks

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the ongoing ransomware campaign, known as “ESXiArgs.” Malicious actors may be exploiting known vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi servers that are likely running unpatched and out-of-service or out-of-date versions of VMware ESXi software to gain access and deploy ransomware. The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I was wondering if any of you have had success measuring TX/RX in LibreNMS for an Adva FSP150 model and if so how you did it, I am running firmware 19.7.2 on the Adva and Libre is on 22.6.0 (this is likely not upto date with the latest release, I'm currently stuck due to work change control etc....)
 I have Juniper devices on librenms where under health I have dbm which shows me the readings and graphs of the individual ports for TX & RX, I would like this for the Adva device. I'm assuming as LibreNMS identifies the Juniper as a Juniper but the Adva as a Generic Device this is why I see this difference.
 I have checked the definition and discovery files within Libre and Yaml files do exist for measuring the TX and RX of Adva_FSP150 ports. I took the OIDs being used in this file and set them up as custom OIDs in libre with Gauge selected and dbm as my unit, I do see graphs under customer OIDs but no data being pulled. When I created the customer OIDs I ran a test which said value returned & successful.
 I think my next step will be downloading a MIB browser and checking to ensure the OIDs I have from the YAML file are correct.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be most appreciated

 I'm having a little bit of an issue. We are getting weird network drops and packet issues and I suspect it's coming from an MTU Change
 we recently configured all our interfaces on our Dell FTOS Devices to have MTU of 9216
 via 
 mtu 9216
 Our VLAN Interfaces and Port Channels do not have any MTU statements. Currently our ESXI Boxes are now showing less than ideal performance and acting as if there is a performance drop via network (pings randomly dropping for 10 seconds at a time under load). The ESXI Boxes have vSwitches set at 9000 which is their max.
 I noticed their may be an ip mtu config. Would this also need to be set?

 Was wondering if anyone has completed a one-drive migration using Migration Manager. I've done a test migration with one user, however it seems to have migrated all the data to the root of OneDrive and not within the folders I'd like.
 CSV file is configured as follows
 Column A has the data source Column B,C not filled in as not required for onedrive Column D has the email address for the onedrive user Column E has the folders. I've done this for each folder I would like to move, Pictures, Desktop, Documents so three columns for each.
 Column F I have the same as column E thinking it would put whatever was in the pitures to pictures in onedrive ect.
 ​
 Any help would be great, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just moved from tier II to system admin for a small company. To say I’m a little overwhelmed is an understatement but I think that’s how it goes. Anyway I have a pretty serious problem I think and would def appreciate some advice. 
 So the company I’m working for conducts certification training and has 100 or so workstations (split between 15 corporate employees and 85 student computers). Every computer has windows 10 enterprise installed but I have no clue where the licensing information is. The computers are also so old there’s no original license key burned into the motherboard. The admin who set this all up died and his replacement was clueless. When a computer needed to be reimaged he used keys from visual studio :( (all I can do is put a sad face here). 
 So here’s my question, am I right to assume that I would need to contact a license broker and purchase a windows 10 pro volume OEM license? Does anyone have any idea how much that might cost for 100 computers? 
 Also, I think enterprise would be better for the corporate employees. We already have E3 licenses and are a silver partner with Microsoft. Once there’s a legit windows installation and the machine is added in azure I think that would check that block, but would there be any reason to also upgrade student computer from pro to enterprise (I don’t think so)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just looking to replace some aging ASR1002 routers. We use this for eBGP and with the routing table nearing 1 million routes we need to either start filtering routes or preferably replacing them with hardware which can cope with much more routes. 
 As part of this upgrade we are also looking to increase the transit links from 10Gb links to 100Gb links as well as any uplinks to our core. 
 At the moment we have several transits coming in so we want to look at potentially having two transits per router so that's 2 x 100Gb and then we also want dual uplinks for reslience so 4 x 100Gb in total. 
 Unfortunately this takes the C8500-12X4QX out of the picture as it won't support 4 x 100Gb links. 2 x 100Gb + 1 40Gb would be fine but not more than 240Gb in enabled links. 
 So the next model up would be the C8500-20x6C. This has 6 x 100Gb links which can all be enabled. However the caveat is that this is coming in at £250,000 which includes a £190,000 discount. Ouch! 
 Unfortunately I do have to stick with Cisco for this. We do have other DC's with Juniper but in this case it HAS to be Cisco. 
 I'm wondering if I should instead be looking at the ASR9000 range or if the price point of that is also going to be just as ridiculous? 
 To give an idea of what Juniper is charging for their MX204 which can handle 4 x 100Gb we were recently quoted £38,000 which includes the perpetual licensing. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've setup Microsoft 365 Defender Outgoing Anti-spam policies per Microsoft's recommendations.
  
"Restrict sending to external recipients (per hour)" is set to 500.
 
"Maximum recipient limit per day" is set to 1000
 
"Over limit action" is set to "Restrict the user from sending mail"
 
 Yesterday the Policy triggered, and the User got blocked.
 The "High-severity alert: User restricted from sending email" said
  
User name@domain.dom has sent 35 internal and 342 external recipients in the last day, exceeding their External limit"
  
So why was the Policy triggered, and the User blocked?
 This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, on 2 different MS Tenants.
 I've checked that no other policies are in effect.
 The user in question made a mail with more than a hundred Recipients and that mail had an empty Subject Line (yep!)
 Theory: Microsoft has an extra set of (not visible) policies that might trigger before the limits we have defined, is reached.
 Any other ideas?

 The main SQL server on our LAN has a one way connection LAN>DMZ to push certain tables into a new DB on the new DMZ SQL server.
 It's all working great, but I'm not sure how best to go about granting the app access.
 I've created a new SQL user on the database with read only access, is that right? I've noticed it's also appeared under security/users and I can use it to login with SSMS?
 Just want to ensure I'm doing the right thing here.

 Nothing advanced, just something very simple to say Engineer A and B will be doing 1-2-3 tomorrow at 12pm.
 They already Have M365 so i was thinking just use MS Planner.
 They only have 2 office workers who will be doing the project management and both have Business Premium.
 They will be doing the project managment for about 15 engineers, although non of them actually need to access planner or get any notifications.
 So my question is, can they use unlicensed users to add them into planner (More for a visual aid than anything else) or would they need to purchase a license of some sort?

 Edit: to avoid confusion, i'm talking about Tasks by Planner" integrated in Teams.

 We're using SSL certs on our (mainly microsoft) systems, currently at 400+ servers. We have a mix of internet registered wildcard, and local generated. The certs are for use with either web based systems, or some custom applications and RDP.
 At the moment this is a manual process and we really need some monitoring to email alert us in advance of expiry. An additional preference if possible is the tool to also allow us to renew the cert.
 Does anyone have any suggestions? 
 One requirement is we need to download and host the application internally. We don't host systems for external use so will not permit a web based SSL monitor (such as Dotcom-monitor) inbound access.
 Preferably a windows based app, but if it needs to run on Linux, I'm sure I can convice our manager that needs to happen. I've found one script on an MS site, but this requires plugins and scripitng knowledge, which I'm not familiar with, but could follow instructions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m the only sys-admin of a small but growing 25 person engineering company and I’m thinking about implementing a ticket system but I’m not sure if it’s beneficial.
 I only get two or three user problems per day but I don’t like how the users throw me out of my focus by chatting me up in Teams or calling me and expecting me to answer immediately just to fix the smallest of problems. The company is also trying to hire additional employees and I think it may be important to get another IT person soon. So all in all I do see a ticket system as an improvement.
 The problem is that my boss or anyone else in this company doesn’t know anything about IT and he doesn’t understand that I’m doing more than just fixing the users outlook problems because he just sees everything running fine and doesn’t know what goes into that. Because of that I fear that him seeing only a few support tickets coming in per day will lead him to believe that I don’t work enough. In reality I’m both trying to fix everything my predecessor implemented badly and without any documentation while keeping everything running and researching into improvements. But that can’t be put into tickets he can track.
 Would you recommend a full ticket system like Freshdesk in this situation? I thought about just creating a shared support mailbox instead so he at least doesn’t get statistics and I still get less distractions but maybe I’m better off with the status quo?

 I'm currently starting to plan migrating around 60 CentOS 8 Stream servers as they'll reach EOL next year. 
 I've done a test run with CentOS 9 Stream, but I've ran into quite a bit of problems that would require rather large changes to our "way of doing things". 
 I've looked into alternatives for CentOS Stream 8, and what first came to mind was Rocky Linux 8 and so far it looks promising - especially the EOL in 2029 - but I'm not sure if I want to commit to it. 
 Has anyone of you switched away from CentOS 8 Stream to Rocky Linux? If so, did you stumble upon something unexpected? Any other Distros you would recommend checking out? 
 Thanks for your time!

 I seem to recall at some point someone on this sub finding the culprit but my search here is failing me. So I was wondering if someone here either went through this before and found the answer, or can help direct me how to troubleshoot something like this.
 So far all I've been doing is disabling background services like Google Drive one by one until it eventually stops, but there's a theory that it's our network shares or VPN causing it.
 It's only happening to one of the five computers we're currently testing on Win 11, so I'm half tempted to just format as well. But I'd rather figure out the real cause...

 We just recently updated our IT charter and wanted to know how other companys deal with users signing them.
 HR doesn't want to get involved in the process, not even during the hiring workflow. So obviously IT has to find a way.
 I thought about simply sending an email to all our users with the pdf attached accompanied with a "how to insert esignature on a document", but i feel the process will be too tedious for the users and obviously for the IT team especially on the storage of these documents.
 Do any of you guys use an electronic document management system, to store and provide pdf files so that authenticated users (through LDAP or AD) can digitally sign documents ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following scenario: 6 subsidiaries, 3 exchange servers (different sites) in DAG (1 witness), 250 users and on-prem AD.
 The plan is to migrate on-prem exchange to exchange online and decommission on-prem exchange after migration if possible. We also want to sync the user password hashes to MS365 and use our on-prem AD.
 Cutover migration is not an option for me cause of the 6 subsidiaries, so I think exchange hybrid is the way to go. I read many articles and MS pages but still having questions regarding minimal vs full hybrid: 
 - Why arent users manageable via on-prem ad using minimal hybrid? Is there a way to accomplish using minimal hybrid and on-prem ad and password sync? 
 - Why minimal hybrid should be used for a couple of weeks and not in long term? If all users are migrated, I dont have the problems with free/busy sharing and so on.
 - Modern vs classic auth, what to use?
 According to my current state of knowledge I would do the following.
 1: Change UPNs (.local domain)
 2: IDfix
 3: AAD connect
 4: Full hybrid
 5: Move mailboxes to MS365
 6: Install management exchange 2019
 7: Decommission exchange 2013 dag

 The Servers run Vmware 8.0 and have been firmware upgraded.
 Switches are WS-C2960X-24TD-L running IOS 15.2(7)E4
 ​
 We are not getting any link lights or connections with the DAC cables, we have tried:
  
FS.com SFP+ Cable
 Aruba genuine SFP+ cable
 3rd Party "Cisco compatible" SFP+ cable
  
​
 We have tried all variations of different NIC ports, different Servers and switch ports.
 ​
 The below commands have been run on the Cisco to allow 3rd party DACs:
 service unsupported-transceiver
 and
 no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid
 ​
 I will update the post later with output from the switch CLI, but suffice to say we can't get a link, from the Server side all we can see is a "disconnected" state. We can't see any obvious licensing errors on the switches (its on "Lan base" from memory?)
 ​
 We also tried connecting a Windows DL380 Gen10 Server with different 10Gb NICs and this also didn't work.
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 Probably our next idea once we re-group is to install a loaner Aruba 10Gb switch and see if we can get Server connectivity to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rant time. So for those who don't know, they decided to get on the cloud train. The server version of popular products like Confluence and Jira are no longer to be sold and everyone has to join them in the cloud. Shouldn't be a problem, right? Both are server-driven products that are displayed in web browsers. I bet the interfaces are identical. 
 WRONG, SCRUB! They split the code bases and the products barely resemble each other. Whole layout and functionality is different. And boy do they know how to screw things up. 
 Like the multimedia macro? Tough luck. It's been removed from cloud. So if you, say, migrate a server site with videos to the cloud all your multimedia macros are broken. Ok, so how do you link the uploaded video on the page back to the page? See, if you had the multimedia macro you'd just put the macro on the page and select the video. 
 Well, what you do is you download the videos to your hard drive and then drag and drop them back to the site and then delete the duplicate videos that are now attached.
 Seriously? Did I get this wrong or is this the official answer coming from support? 
 Official answer. There's two feature requests related to fixing this feature gap, one is from 2018 and the other from 2019. 
 And that's how it goes. Plenty of feature requests out there and if you think anything's going to happen on them then I've got swampland in Florida to sell you. 
 This is an incredibly frustrating trend in software these days. They'll switch to a monthly payment model and just stop working on the product, content to milk the existing user base until they leave for sheer frustration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seems like all hell broke loose today. I have a fleet of users with ubuntu linux laptops (ranges from 18.04 - 22.04) that have been on GlobalProtect for a while now. We included 6.0.4.something in our internal repo and installing the GP_UI package is part of our standard ubuntu image. LDAP auth on the backend because Palo/OpenConnect and SAML have been a moving disaster for years...
 Today, a huge uptick in users reporting that GP client is failing a FIPS initialization. No changes to the portal or gateways, and my environment is not FIPS. Windows clients are still fine, only linux users are getting the error as of today.
 The workaround is to remove and re-install the package, and is working for these users. I was wondering if anyone else with Palo Alto GlobalProtect has seen a notable increase in users with FIPS init failure errors.
 I have opened a case with Palo as well as collected user debug logs. But, because linux has never been a priority for Palo, I'm not holding my breath. This will probably turn in to a post about how PaloAlto should drop linux all together, but for now, I'd like to find out WHY? Did Ubuntu depreciate a SSL version that PanGP uses?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently had OSPF go down between an edge Palo Alto and a Cisco core switch. 
 No changes were made to either device as far as I can tell. Logs show no commits on the PA and no config changes to the Cisco switch (HA Pair)
 after some investigation I get:
  
ECHANGE to DOWN, Neighbor Down : Too many retransmission
  
found a few articles on both Cisco and PA side, both pointing to either MTU issue or Packet loss
  
Packet loss is unlikely: 1000 pings from OSPF interfaces 0% loss, <2ms average latency. They are directly connected
  
Some further debugging:
  
I can see the Adjacency process begin and the DBD packets transmit 
 I can see the VlXX OUT to the PA 
 I can see the VlXX IN from the PA 
 OUT packet len:1412 
 MTU on the router interface is 1500, verified by ping sweep 
 I can see the packets retransmit until they hit 25 where it is killed due to excessive retransmission 
 IN packets still come but are ignored for a timer until process repeats
  
So that size 1412 shouldn't get fragmented correct? 
 One other thing I noticed is that on the HA Pair, all the Vlan interfaces are setup HSRP, except the one facing the PAs. For whatever reason, those vlan interfaces are setup separate i.e. VlanXX x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2 with no standby... 
 oddly after the Neighbor exchange goes down, I see a new election between the two devices but using other HSRP Vlan interfaces, but over the OSPF VlanXX already in process. This setup seems really odd to me? Could it cause issues?
 It's been a while since I went really deep into OSPF troubleshooting so I'm at a little bit of a loss of where to go next. I can't find any other errors on the PA or Cisco devices other than the constant retransmission/kill loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: two man IT team tasked with rolling out network to multiple construction sites across the county. No fiber or copper connections available so reliant on LTE until these get put in towards the end of the constructions site's life. Hoping to achieve LTE router in a bridge/ modem mode to a UDM Pro downstream (business uses a Unifi network stack, affordable, standadized). 
 I am trying to get a Teltonika RUTXR1 to successfully bridge, or passthrough, it's WAN IP address to a UDM Pro. The Telonika has two SIM WAN interfaces (one EE, one O2), both interfaces are set to passthrough mode and the UDM Pro is set to DHCP for on it's WAN interface. 
 In bridge mode, the Teltonika is no longer accessible (as expected) however, the UDM Pro also does not get the WAN IP address and says that there is no internet connection.
 In passthrough mode the Teltonika is still accessible/ manageable through it's remote management system (as expected), the UDM Pro is adoptable onto the Unifi system and can be remotely managed. However, it's WAN IP address in the Unifi console is a private 192.168.1.x IP address and not the WAN IP the Teltonika has. Laptops connected to the UDM Pro also have no WAN connectivity even though the UDM can get firmware updates and be remotely managed.
 Where am I going wrong? Why does the UDM Pro have some connectivity in pass through mode but absolutely zero in bridge mode? 
 Is it CGNAT causing the issue? Is it a NAT or firewall issue on the Teltonika? The whitepapers state that all routing, NAT and firewall functionality are disabled in bridge mode (as expected) so, seems unlikely?

 I'm looking into upgrading our current cisco routers.
 Environment:
 - 2x 1Gbit symmetrical bgp peers.
 - bgp routing
 - full routing table
 Now looking at the ISR 4331, the throughput is only 100Mbit? (https://community.cisco.com/t5/routing/isr-4331-max-throughput-licence/td-p/4312292)Is this correct even if we are just doing routing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 For our non-revenue-generating R&D lab, we've been using the Cisco Small Business line of switches (SG350XG-24T, and SG550XG-24T) for 10GbT ToR switches. They have performed well for us over the years. Now I see that the Cisco Small Business (i.e., Linksys-heritage) line is now no longer being produced, and now it's the "Cisco Business" line for SME networking. Looks like the "Cisco Business 350-24XT Managed Switch" would be the closest model as compared to what we've bought in the past; I have a few questions...
 1) Is the NOS closer to Cisco IOS than the CSB line was (that was "IOS-like" but had quite a few different commands, etc.) 2) There's no "DNA" license BS with this line? 3) Are there other good choices for a 24-port 10GbT switches out there? We have been swinging our switching over to Juniper, but they don't have a good/lower-cost 24-ports of 10GbT model out there from what I can tell... 
 (And also, I know 10GbT is kind of a legacy port type vs SFP+, but that's what all their servers have in the location we're buying for, and what the admin staff there knows...)
 Thanks!

 I have a Nexus 9k that shows a different local bridge ID than what is the Root bridge ID. However, none of the links are in role "Root", and all other switches in the network have their root port going toward this Nexus 9k. There are no VDCs running on this Nexus 9k. And when I do show spanning-tree root on the Nexus 9k, no ports are listed as the root port, and the cost to root is always 0.
 Am I missing something? Seems like a bug to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started a new job as a junior tech hoping to join a more mature network and IT group. To my surprise, the network is a bit of a mess and it seems like network design best practices were not followed at all. There's also lack of documentation.
 One thing that's really confused me is the way Switch to Switch connections were done. The network tech created seperate VLANs for each switch to switch connection, configured the ports as access ports, and then tagged the vlan. As a result, there are 299 VLANs with most only being used for 2 ports. 
 ​
 For example -
 Switch A -
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/3
 switchport access vlan 614
 ​
 interface Vlan614
 description NCH-3
 ip address 10.2.254.46 255.255.255.252
 ip pim sparse-dense-mode
 ​
 VLAN Name Status Ports
 ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
 614 NCH3-NCH1 active Te1/3
 ​
 Switch B -
 interface GigabitEthernet1/1/1
 switchport access vlan 614
 ​
 interface Vlan614
 ip address 10.2.254.45 255.255.255.252
 ip pim sparse-dense-mode
 ​
 VLAN Name Status Ports
 ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
 614 NCH3-NCH1 active Gi1/1/1, Gi1/1/3, Gi1/1/4, Te1/1/1, Te1/1/2
 ​
 I'm a junior tech so this has really confused me. I always thought that you want switch to switch connections configured as Trunk. What would be the best way to correct something like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7(?) years into my career and I've finally reached the point of burn out. My previous role nearly reached the same point, but I left before I got to that.
 It's been brewing in me for some months now, managed to get a pay rise in the summer (but IT pay in the UK is dogshit anyway). The userbase we support is increasing, but we're horrendously understaffed, no time to research new technologies, we're locked in with garbage fucking systems because somehow it's not our decision. Somehow spend more time doing what should be a dedicated first line support's job, instead of doing actual system infrastructure maintenance. Sales guy is letting small clients set up BYOD systems and then trying to impose lockdowns on their personal devices, including using Intune/Endpoint Manager with a bunch of fucking Macbooks, then coming to me for help (spoiler: I can't)
 But yesterday, I had the full blown meltdown. Simple task, user needs printer/scanner installing. It's an older HP so probably won't be too much of a bastard to sort. Log on, no admin access for some reason, looks like Intune hadn't been applying the settings, and of course, Intune gives 0 useful information as to why. So it's possible the user is still an admin. Try to get him to elevate, he's not doing it and keeps cancelling, then he brings up HP Smart and disappears for 20 minutes and I get disconnected. Later get an email saying "all working, thanks"
 Just lost it. Why is such a simple task such a twat to do? Why is our IT structure so broken?
 Good people to work for, just not a good company
 Had an interview today, big pay rise, decent looking company. Stage 1 of 3 complete, finger's crossed I make it to the end (I won't!)
 Thanks for attending my rant, how's your week going?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While changing internet providers we are left with the responsibility of sorting out our own phone line. As landlines are becoming obsolete, we are looking into VoIP. We assumed it would be as cheap or cheaper than landlines since everything is online and we buy our equipment.
 We only need one number, and several headsets that work in a hierarchy where all incoming calls are going into one office with the option of directing the calls to the other headsets (if someone is trying to reach a certain room).
 All the VoIP providers are saying that we need individual users for each DECT phone, to be able to transfer between them and to be able to make phone calls. We will need 7 headsets, and what is worse, 7 users taking us to quite a monthly tariff considering that we are not using more than 200 minutes/month.
 At this point, if anyone has an idea of how to set this up without advanced setup knowledge, that would be amazing. I am also happy to jump on a quick call, for a little paid consultancy.
 I've made a diagram of the setup I was thinking to get for the business which can be seen here.
 Any help is much appreciated!

 I've had a look at historic reddit posts on this but everything thats returned is a few years old, so I'm wondering if there are newer technologies for this.
 I'm essentially looking to dip my toes into configuring BGP, I can see a lot of resources that'll allow me to do this: DN42, VMs from Stubarea51(doesn't seem to support IPv6) , GNS3 and so on..
 Is there a general consensus as to which tool is best to get myself up to speed with the BGP Protocol? 
 Thanks!

And then they litterely starting to google random shit and add it to a post i did on our intranet explaining me what to do for cybersecurity. Like litterly telling me how to do my job haha.
 Context: We just did a phishing campaign run, which in our eyes was an obvious phish and 21% of the corrensponents clicked on the link of which 9% added sensitive information in a form and clicked on send. You can say that cybersecurity awareness is not a hot topic in our company which we are trying to address trough management and policy (which is going great by the way).
 Sometimes shit like this gets under your skin when people start to complain that massively shit can get to you. Which it now does.
 How do you handle these kinds of situations? What do you tell yourself, mentally?
 ​
 p.s.On friday my manager is going to share the details of the phish, and is going to say that "most" of the people that are now commenting on this implementation where also the persons that have clicked on the link in the e-mail. In Holland we call it "met gestrekte been erin" and in english that would be " With straight leg in it"

 last time we had a case in the company that someone was sending spam from our user's account. It was probably a trojan or someone had cracked the user's password. We know how to protect ourself against trojans and password cracking, but sometimes these situations can happen due to user carelessness. 
 What security measures do you have in place, on the antispam firewall or perhaps on Exchange, to prevent you from sending spam from your network and being blacklisted?
 I would just like to add: Sometimes our users need to send an email to more than 1000 recipients.
 Thank you very much in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started this role at a SAP centered enterprise and I was tasked with building a UI that displays and aggregates daily reports of some plant. Due to security reasons, the plants terminal is not connected to the web. The terminal instead generates a .csv report which is then shared in a shared folder.
 The plants syso wasn't much of a help in determining how everything works there. He sent me this URI that opened a shared folder in my work laptop win 11 machine
 \\hcldata1\hcs_fldr$\45-SOME-MANUFACURING-DATA 
 This opened a folder on my machine. Now, this is very confusing to me as I am a programmer and I don't use Windows that much. Who serves this folder? Is this OneDrive (i was told no)? Azure? How did I access something not on my PC without a proper URL/URI? Sorry if those questions seem basic. I am just a Linux guy so I am unfamiliar with enterprises that run on Windows products.
 P.S: Also I need to know how I automate a process that sends reports added to that folder to a remote web server written in Node. Not a tutorial, but more of a general direction. Like, do I install WSL and write a bash script? Or do I write a powershell script? Just a direction.

 We have 2 x junior analysts who are not being managed very well causing the issue to continue.
 I pitched a roadmap/development plan for the junior analysts which would involve them managing the IT assets and working alongside the 2nd line team.
 The response I got was ‘how much would you expect for the additional responsibility’.
 My salary currently sits at £42k ($50k) and while an increase in salary would be helpful I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot here and come across as greedy. Can anyone provide their thoughts on what they deem reasonable compensation (if any) for the extra 2 x analysts and implementation of asset control processes.
 Apologies from me if this is not the right space to raise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iam new to networking. So any one with proper knowlege pls help me.
 1.I have a dlink home router it's ip is 192.168.0.1. its dhcp range is 192.168.0.50 to 192.168.0.100.
 i want to extend the router wifi range and ethernet ports. 
 So I have another linksys router of ip 192.168.1.1.
 I want to connect linksys router with dlink to extend wifi range and ethernet using lan cable. 
 How to do it? 
 My instructor said to connect one lan port of dlink router with the wan port on linksys router through a lan cable and turn off dhcp on linksys router. 
 So you will get internet through linksys router. Is he right? 
 Then what about the ip adress conflict between both router. One is 192.168.0.1 and other is 192.168.1.1
 Both are on Different network. Does it works? 
 As per my assumption every device connected to router through the wired or wirelessly to the router should be on same network. 
 If it works how to acess second router configaration page.? 
 Because if we connect second router to the first router,dhcp server of first router changes the second router ip. 
 Then how to know the ip of second router? 
 2.Also I have tenda router. I want to connect it to dlink router through wirelessly. 
 It has a seperate wireless repeating option on configuration page. 
 On that menu there is 3 option 1.wisp 2.universal repeater 3.ap mode. 
 Which one should I choose? 
 Also tell me the remaining changes I should do on tenda router? 
 3.does all router have wireless repeatet option? 
 If don't then is any other way to connect second router to primary router wirelessly? 
 4.if we purchase a router for extension how to know it has all the function necessary for router extension?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've altered some information below and made it generic so as to be less recognizable.
 I was in a technology meeting where Really Bad Idea™ was proposed. At the time, I told them such and normally my opinions have weight, but this time I was outnumbered and they were locked in. Another in my cohort at this meeting, we will call him Mr. Z, is the kind of person who gleefully runs and does whatever upper management asks. He was as much for it as I was against it. So this thing got legs and ran.
 It's my role to sell some of these upper management decisions to the group, and do what was needed to make them successful. This time that wasn't possible. It was too draconian. It directly impacted people and their time. All I could do was offer some help. But I presented it as neutrally as possible so as not to throw anyone under the bus because it's just never good to openly do so. As a result they thought I initiated it, which normally I live with but this time was different.
 When the complaints from the field started coming in, people didn't want to say anything to me directly so they went to Mr. Z much to my surprise. Mr. Z then didn't own up to the fact that he was a big part of why this idea went forward. He just quietly listened, sympathized, and then went about his day. I know this because I overheard one of these conversations.
 At that point I called a WebEx with everyone in the field, apologized for the nightmare and the impact it had, and gathered data with all of their feedback on the recent issue. Everyone was 100% against it and all of the suggestions to fix it aligned. I then presented that data to upper management and requested to make modifications to the idea so it could work. It was more work to fix it but it needed to be fixed with urgency.
 This crisis was averted, but it cost valuable time and had an impact on my street cred. It sucked.

 Funny thing, when I run old rasphone client, then I can connect to it without issue.
 I've even tried to remove rasphone.pbk file in user roaming profile (on server), but it doesn't help. It only works when I copy it from roaming profile into C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Connections\Pbk\... but when I create another VPN profile, then I have to copy it to ProgramData too, because new connection doesn't work...
 Is there a way to force the new Windows 10/11 VPN panel to use rasphone.pbk file from roaming profile, and not the C:\ProgramData one?

 The part I’m actually having trouble with? 
 I’ve been working on a script to re-do the user Outlook profile and completely log them out of office and teams and work/school account, saved credentials etc.
 Outlook works fine since I can pipe 2 registry keys for a new profile and then make it default on the next launch. They then get logged in with seamless sso 
 Basically a reset without nuking the actual profile.
 Normally we would use our vendor tool to help the users get logged in to the “new” accounts but of course this is a VDI environment and it doesn’t play nicely.
 I can’t get teams/OneDrive to log out seemingly No matter what I do to the registry or folders there in.
 I did see some scripts online but they don’t actually work lol.

 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PersonalizationCSP Value name: LockScreenImageStatus 
 Registry 2:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PersonalizationCSP Value name: LockScreenImagePath 
 Registry 3:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PersonalizationCSP Value name: LockScreenImageUrl 
 The above registries work successfully on Windows 10. But I have no idea how to accomplish the same task on Windows 11.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 :)

 I've worked at my current place of employment for close to 7 years and it's high time for me to move on. I've got a nice resume and some great experience under my belt but...
 This is my first job (like, ever)
 I've been told it's an incredibly dumb decision to inform your current job that you're planning to change companies, but I'm stuck! Who do I use for my professional references if not the people I work with?
 Apologies if this is a dumb question. This whole process is new to me so I'm a bit scared of stuffing things up.

 With that said, I need to survey Wi-Fi at about 5-7 medium-sized buildings (20-55k sq. ft.) and install some access points (or in some cases potentially hire someone else to install an entire new system), then show some of the higher-ups the before and after Wi-Fi surveys of the site.
 I've been reading up on this, and it seems like AirMagnet and Ekahau are the popular ones, but dang are they expensive. At one building with 3 floors and 17 access points, it costed us around $2500 for parts and labor on a mesh Wi-Fi system, so we can't really justify the same amount or more for just surveying from our perspective.
 For this type of work/scenario, would Netspot Pro be fine?
 Let me know if clarification is needed, or if I am just way off here.
 ​
 Bonus:
 I would love to learn more about setting up business/enterprise-level Wi-Fi systems, what would be a good way for me to learn more? Like I see the backside of patch panels and it looks crazy, but it makes me very interested.

But they have been intermittently responding to payment reminders with excuses about how they are about to send a check. This has been going on for 191 days now!
 What do you all think about giving them a notice about limiting their bandwidth until payment is made? ISPs and mobile carriers already do this, why not us?

 we are trying to isolate residential networks from enterprise networks. Unfortunately, we exit into the same landscape (enterprise and residential). The question is can we use the following subnets???? Each house will be having roughly 10-20 (max 30) hosts.
 House 1 - 10.80.10.0/24
 House 2 - 10.80.11.0/24
 House 3 - 10.80.12.0/24
 House 4 - 10.80.13.0/24
 House 5 - 10.80.14.0/24
 House 6 - 10.80.15.0/24
 House 7 - 10.80.16.0/24
 House 8 - 10.80.17.0/24
 House 9 - 10.80.19.0/24
 House 10 - 10.80.20.0/24
 House 11 - 10.80.21.0/24
 House 12 - 10.80.22.0/24
 House 13 - 10.80.23.0/24
 House 14 - 10.80.24.0/24
 The idea is to have all these houses in different vlans with the above subnets. Thank you tons guys!!!!

 Great, get Windows hello for business going, applied to some test machines : fantastic! Face id + pin! yea!
 Then we figure out we can simply login with user/pass, and there is not way to enable mfa. Why? what's the point of even implementing Windows hello for business if you can't enforce mfa on user/passwords?
 Then ok, phew... we can hide the login with username/password button but...you can't use runas / rdp etc..
 so what is the effing point? Can someone explain me the logic of this?

 Seeking advice on handling a growing concern in our organisation regarding cyber security for our board members. They frequently access sensitive information on their personal devices, and their skill level is very worrying. We've recently identified them as the weakest link in our organisation due to the mix of BYO PCs and Macs.
 Has anyone else faced a similar issue? If so, what steps did you take to mitigate the risk and ensure the security of your data?
 Considerations thus far include making 365 read-only when accessed in a browser. We've ruled out supplying a separate device for our organisation as they sit on multiple boards.
 We are considering Netspoke for our org but only in the early stages of this discussion. Could this assist.
 Any suggestions or best practices would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.

 Explanation: I've worked in smaller environments ever since I started in IT 8 years ago. I've worked on a lot of different things but not necessarily deep into a single thing. If I need to know more about something I can read documentation and/or use Google and solve the issue. The problem is this doesn't seem to be cutting it. Companies want me to know things off the top of my head without doing research. Or some things I am confident I would be able to learn/pick up on fairly quickly. Some of this is my poor interviewing skills which I am working on. For example I interviewed for a Tech specialist 3/Jr Sys Admin roll and the feedback I got at the end of the interview was that they thought I had the skills of a level 1 tech. 
 So I guess my question is what have you guys done to build your "jack of all trades" job history into something that works at a larger company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still new to the role, so I'm uncertain about the best practices for this. Apparently, this Small school has to have an internal DNS server to direct them to our website using the internal IP's. This is for all the students and everyone in every subnet. And I asked why they just don't use the public IP if it's accessible. Well, the answer was simple. You cannot access any of the internal websites from the inside using the public IP address. I thought that was strange. 
 I did a basic traceroute to the website and yep, it stops on our Palo Alto firewall. It's due to an Age out/incomplete which I'm sure is due to the Virtual router in the firewall not knowing where to send the traffic. 
 However, I'm not sure how this should be done. 
 Do I just implement a routing rule that anyone coming to the firewall internally asks for the public IP address of our website to redirect them back through the same interface? 
 Baically the Default Gateway from the Core Switch has 1 interface connected to the Palo as the next hop that connects that interface to the router, then that router has a next hop for all traffic to our actual router. 
 So 
 Core Switch 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 Palo Alto Vr Router -PublicIP interface. 1 -> Public IP interface Physical Router -> The internet. 
 To be clear yes the Firewall has an interface with a public IP address that we own that hops to the router with also a Public IP address that we own and then to the internet.

 We are slowing trying to move everything off of ESXi and on to Hyper-V
 Going to use the MS storage migration service. About 2.5TB 
 Right now the drive holding all of the data is on a virtual disk added to the VM via ESXi.
 My question.
 Is it best to just add a virtual disk on the new server in Hyper-V and copying all the data there?
 Or is there any benefit of connecting the new storage volume via iSCSI to the new server and then copying all the data there? 
 Only benefit I can think of is that if the file server had an issue we can In theory connect the drive to another server via iSCSI.
 However I know I can just mount the virtual disk to another server via Hyper-V
 Little background on the environment, have a Hyper-V cluster going with a clusters storage via a Nimble SAN.
 I am also planning a doing a replication of the server to a offsite location using Veeam.
 Thank you all in advance for your input please comment if I am maybe not going at this the right way or if there is a better way too got to accomplish this.

From what I’m finding the 802.11s protocol is simply the protocol for an ESS mesh network so I feel like I’m going in circles trying to compare something to itself. If y’all could help me figure out what I’m missing or point me in the direction of some papers to read I’d really appreciate it!

 How would hosts from Subnet A handle an ARP announcement regarding a host from Subnet B?
 Longer question: 
 We are trying to setup a VPN server on our servers subnet, 10.1.4.0. We randomly decided an IP range that the server would hand out to clients, 10.1.16.0. When a client connects to the server, the server sends out an ARP announcement saying that it's MAC address has said client with a 10.1.16.x address. But when I look at the server's gateway (a Firepower) and other hosts on the subnet, the ARP tables aren't storing/saving hosts with 10.1.6.x IPs. Is that expected behavior? I know that ARP packets don't usually cross subnet boundaries, but this seems like a unique situation so I figured I'd ask you smart folks. Thanks in advance!

 But as I am also involved in the network design in our company I am curious to know what real world experiences look like. Googleing often gives you just a comparison table and a summary but never very specific and often just scratching the surface. So what experiences and opinions do you have about it and where do you see strengths and weaknesses in your network? Has it actively helped against malware or was it a weakness (for example due to weak root cert protection).
 Thank you for your answer in advance and have a lovely day. So let me end with the word: Fight! 😉

 The issue I'm running into is everything I'm reading has me creating a VFI in manual configuration mode. But I don't have that option...when I go to issue the command the only choice is point-to-point. If I try to re-issue the command the help menu will then SAY that manual is an option, but if I try it I get told the name is already in use.
 The other issue has to do with the xconnect command on the interface. The docs I'm reading have you issue the xconnect name with the VFI, and that's also not an option: The only option is the IP of the neigbor. Maybe if I configure the VFI manually and actually get the "vpn id" option into the VFI it'll allow me to attach it with xconnect? But I can't figure out what I'm missing.
 This is on 3800 routers. I've tried different code and always get the same options. Am I missing something that turns these features on?

 When last I posted here on the topic, prior to the Christmas break, I was being pressured into shunting all of my IT stuff into a broom closet. My direct supervisor is the 2nd in command for the whole school system, and he became more and more furious over this request as I brought it up to him over our break. He clearly is on my side in this, which means case closed, it's not happening. 
 I've chatted up the admin at the high school since on numerous occasions, and it has never once come up in conversation. Having 6 carts full of laptops charging in the room every day has helped, as there would be no space at all for this stuff. Between that, a laminator, a sound system for our gym, and countless spare machines, it would be impossible to fit all that stuff into their proposed "space", never mind trying to cram a pair of bodies in there with our desks to boot. 
 All in all, I wanted to update everyone to let you all know that it worked, and that I am still master of my domain (puns for days). I know my employees appreciate my hard line I took in this matter, but I also wanted to thank all of you for supporting my choices in this matter. It's one of my highest rated posts on here, and I got a lot of great feedback from members of this sub. IT people deserve better than the crap we get from most people, and all the IT folks I talk to, even in conversations today, agree with me. We are not often treated with respect and dignity, but I'm not going to let that happen on my watch, with my staff, for as long as I am employed here. 
 So thanks again, and feel free to comment or message me any questions you might have about working on a First Nations reserve, or in a FN school. I know my living and working situation is unique, so don't be shy.

 This question is regarding stacking/ uplinks. 
 We're planning a new location setup. This will be my first time doing a configuration like this solo as our engineer is no longer with us, I appreciate any help/advice 
 We run a two-tier hierarchy design. We'll have 1 Core switch along with a 5 stack for access switches. This will be for a small(ish) branch location, so not looking to go all out. 
 What would be the best way to uplink the access stack to the Core? 
 Looking though what our old engineer did, he would use the first two ports on the stack commander to use as uplinks to the Core.
 Would that be the best option, or do we have a point of failure if that stack commander goes down? 
 I'm thinking of using 1 port ( or two?) from each switch in the stack to use as an uplink to the Core. Is this silly/over kill? Planning on configuring them all into 1 LAG. ( ex. 1/1/1, 2/1/1, 3/1/1, etc. into LAG ID 1).
 Also, they're looking at getting a 24 port core opposed to a 48. Technically, if I use 1 port on each switch for uplinks I should only need ~16 ports, ~20 if if I go with two per switch. 
 Is there something I'm not thinking of that could cause issues down the line? Our current Core's are all 48 ports, though the old admin would use the extra ports as Access, which I do not plan on doing.

Would it make sense to use Cloudflare (or some provider) as an authoritative DNS and then use a self-hosted recursive DNS within our network? 
 Or should we host our own authoritative and recursive DNS servers?
 Or should we use a recursive DNS server provided by someone like Cloudflare?
  
Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

 I've found out how it's implemented according to Microsoft so I'm good on that front, but wanted to see what others thought about it, if anyone has done it and what were your needs that sent you down that route (no pun intended).

 Easy enough let's take a look.
 The alert has been going on since 2008 and they've simply ignored it. 
 I was in middle school when this poor lady started having a problem, and she's just now submitting a ticket.
 The log entries number in the thousands
 Happy Monday everyone.
 Edit: Adding context here since this is blowing up.
 The user is logging into an application that we host on a remote server, the database which is being used has data from as far back as 1999. The application itself still gets updates to this day. Even when deleted the alert still remains
 Edit 2: We normally would clear this thing out with a script. Problem is ours doesn't work for something this large so we've had to contact the vendor.

 We would like to have people using domain joined devices to connect to our wireless lan and just have their internet working, and if the device is not domain joined/whitelisted there is a login page that allows them to authenticate - and grant access to web based on the user group for example.
 I'm not even sure what type of solution am I looking for? Is it considered a NAC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i've been battling Microsoft Teams for the past months, most of the time the Addin have not been added automatically, but for the last week i've been battling a plugin which is showing as Active, however none of the functions actually shows up or works (Share on Teams is the only button that shows up but does nothing) 
 So today i sat down to investigate, and i figured out that the culprit is the MicrosoftTeamsAddin version, however no search results shows any of these issues..
 But i've replicated the issue on 3 WVD Enviroments.
 MicrosoftTeamsAddin Versions 
  
1.0.22321.3 - borked
 
1.0.22304.2 - borked
 
1.0.22272.2 - borked
 
1.0.22234.1 - borked
 
1.0.22209.4 - borked
 
1.0.22147.1 - ok
 
1.0.20091.2 - ok
 
1.0.19296.2 - ok
 
 Teams Versions 
  
1.6.0.376 - borked - 2 February 2023
 
1.5.0.33362 - borked - 14 December 2022
 
1.5.0.31168 - borked - 2 November 2022
 
1.5.0.28361 - borked - 20 October 2022
 
1.5.0.21668 - borked (1.0.22209.4) - 31 August 2022
 
1.5.0.21463 - ok (1.0.22147.1) - 11 August 2022
 
1.5.0.17656 - ok (1.0.22147.1) - 06 July 2022
 
 Teams is installed with ALLUSER=1 and IsWVDEnviroment set to 1 in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Teams 
 I can also confirm the issue is not present when installed as Current user, atleast not on a normal client. 
 So my question is, have any of you encountered this issue AND resolved it? And can you replicate it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are looking at ways to try to reduce the attack surface of on our LAN. To that end, we currently have communication between client workstations blocked so they can only communicate with servers.
 We've tried to go further by even reducing that to only necessary services. For example, we've blocked client workstations from communication with servers via SMB ports 139 and 445 (obviously with a few exceptions such as our file server and Domain Controller).
 Now, running our last port scan, I see we still have port 135 open from workstations to servers. Can I safely block that?
 My understanding is it is used for RPC and remote management. Ideally what I am trying to set up is to block all remote management like RDP, WinRM, etc to my servers from ordinary client workstations and only allow it from a bastion host.
 I know you should not block it between servers like DCs because that will break replication. But what about blocking it from client workstations? Is that safe to do?
 Thanks!

 I don't have much experience with storage, but 100MB/s seq write seems kind of slow, especially for SSD? I understand that we bought entry level storage, but shouldn't it able to outperform our 6 year old storage with HDD disks?
 The new storage is configured with raid 6, compression and deduplication, connected with FC. When testing storage speed without compression and deduplication the results are little bit better, but it doesn't max out CPU in any case.

 I want to externalise some networking tasks to a Help Desk. I want them to perform basic troubleshooting before forwarding a network-related ticket to my support group. 
 Our network is fully cloud-based. So, there won't be a CLI involved. I was thinking to create one generic account, linked with the Help Desk support group email, with ReadOnly rights to be used by all ~60 members of the Help Desk. 
 Some of my colleagues suggested that there is a security & privacy issue with this approach and that I should create personal accounts for all Help Desk operators linked to their work emails. 
 Do you see any security issues with this or not? 
 Thank you in advance!

 We are pretty overwhelmed at the moment and I wanted to see what others though as we seem to be a bit of a different demographic composition. We do self-checkout devices. There is about 1000 locations total and the majority of these are sitting on your standard household type internet circuits. Inexpensive Fiber (FiOS, uVserve, cable internet, cellular routers, and even some DSL (Yes, DSL!). We do have maybe 300 locations that are either on business fiber, or the location we are at provide us internet.
 User base though is only about 500 and a lot of the "is your cable plugged in", "did you reboot your 8-port switch under your desk" is handled by our "Desktop Support team".
 We are also installing 3-7 new locations a week and the network team has to handle getting the internet solution in place as well.
 Our network team is a whopping 3x people. I feel like we need at least 6x. anyone in a similar setup. ?These three people are also responsible for the datacenter networking, our HQ facility, but not VoIP (other than setting up VLANs for phones)

 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64488013 
 Fuck Me. 
 I have done the usual, cancelling cards and passports, keeping an eye on my accounts but I thought I would send a Subject access request to Arnold Clark, to maybe see what data they could have lost, knowing full well that they would struggle to fulfil it BUT hoping against all hope I would get something. 
 I received a quick boilerplate response, explaining their situation and how they can't help right now BUT "we'd ask that you provide a copy of your I.D. (either Driving License or Passport) to enable us to verify your details"
 Fuck No.

 Require a system that will serve a responsive dynamic intranet homepage, with links and menu items for different audiences within the organisation.
 The ability to create and easily manage templates of different link sets for AD user groups (and combinations of groups if possible). We have Azure AD.
 Allows panels to be embedded, serving other pages from our domain eg. KPI info, outstanding tasks etc.
 Bonus points if it already has MS integrations eg. Email, calendar, but not essential.
 Maybe I'm searching the wrong terminology but I'm not finding a turnkey solution for what I've got in mind which I find surprising.
 We have SharePoint but not a fan of the general look & feel so something that builds on this may suffice, but managing SharePoint list items for the different audiences isn't my preferred route for this.
 Welcome your experiences and recommendations.

 Secondly, as I understand it, both do the same thing except that Azure AD is hosted the cloud while on-prem AD is hosted on a local server. Is this correct?
 Can someone explain the main differences between these?

I'll call these AD.foo.bar and BD.foo.bar When users are created they are created in the AD domain. For reasons we want to mange our environment with a different domain. We created the domain BD and a two way trust between them. In the BD domain I can create groups, add users from AD to these groups, authenticate computer logins, most of the things I would expect to be able to do. However we have a couple web applications that can do authentication from Active Directory which want a base DN for users and groups. This is where I run into the problem. The base DN for users something like OU=company,DC=AD,DC=foo,DC=bar While the DN for users is OU=company,DC=BD,DC=foo,DC=bar
 My question, is there a good way around this kind of problem? Is it worth trying to copy users between domains or is there something here that I might totally be missing?

 I ran into a problem which may cause some serious privacy issues, and i havent found any solutions on the internet.
 The problem is as follows, we have a user, he opens the office365 outlook app and checks the inbox of a shared mailbox.
 After checking, he presses on a new email as he decides to mail a client of ours, types the email etc and as last step he goes to the options field and checks the from adres, it shows his personal work email. He sends the mail to our client.
 However, now the mail he has send is showing up in the shared mailbox sent items. Every user can now read the mail in send items. It shows the personal from adres from our user. For me this is 100% reproducible, as i take the same steps. I would expect the reciever to get the mail as send on behalf of the shared mailbox, but to the reciever it shows as a mail recieved by the personal mailbox. The header of the mail also has no sign what so ever from the shared mailbox. 
 Now this is kinda a red flag, as this would mean that user in our organisation might think he is typing a private message to someone else, only to show up in the sent items of the shared mailbox..
 What am I missing? Sorry in advance if it's a bit jibbrish or bad gramma , I will edit the post to clarify or edit Grammer if needs be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We plan to upgrade our File Server Failover Cluster from Server 2016 to Server 2019. It consists of 2 Nodes, Functional Level is 2016. 
 I read these 2 articles:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/upgrade-option-same-hardware
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/cluster-operating-system-rolling-upgrade
 From my understanding, it's possible to upgrade without any downtime?
 Like this?: Pause cluster, drain, evict, reformat, and install Server 2019 on one node. Add this node to the cluster and run it in Mixed-OS mode. Then do the same on the other node and lastly run "Update-ClusterFunctionalLevel". 
 But is that really the most efficient way to do it?
 In the first linked article "Upgrading Failover Clusters on the same hardware" in the overview part it is written:
  
Upgrading the operating system on an existing failover cluster is only supported when going from Windows Server 2016 to Windows 2019. If the failover cluster is running an earlier version, such as Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier, upgrading while the cluster services are running will not allow joining nodes together. 
  
So what does this mean? It's not explained further...
 Lastly, in-place upgrade or new installation?
 Any input is welcome (:

 is there any possibility to do this? and i don't mean any tunnels to access a specific webserver or so, i mean the specific host i am connecting to.

 we are starting with a central log management server and like to extend this later on to a siem solution.
 ATM we are enable more logs on Active Directory. Now the Security Log Protocol on our domain controller fills up quite fast. About 500k events per day. The problem is, that the domain controller become unresponsive some times. 
 How do you deal with this problem? Of course i could raise the cpu and ram on the virutal dc, but it seams that the eventlog services is single threaded. 
 We are using the elastic stack and nxlog as log shipper.
 Thanks.

 Turns out they are all moved into an OU on AD rather than being deleted/removed.
 Is this normal practice? I'm inclined to just remove anything that hasn't logged in for over 1 year (with exceptions)

 Anyone has experience dealing with error similar to the below?
 ​
 ERROR 2 (0x00000002) Copying NTFS Security to Destination File \\filesvr\file.txt
 The system cannot find the file specified.
 Below is the robocopy command that I use.
 ROBOCOPY \\bgr-fp01\f$\data\ G:\data\ /MIR /Sec /SECFIX /XA:SH /XJD /copy:DATSOU /MT:64 /R:1 /W:5 /LOG:%LOG%
 ​
 When taking a look at the above example file, I do not have permission to view the folder/files nor I can see what NTFS/Shared permissions that are set.
 If I take ownership of the folder/subfolder/files, and provide myself full permission to the folder/files, then I won't get the above ERROR 2...
 ​
 There are a lot of the above errors shown in the robocopy log as there are quite a large amount of data to be copied to new file server. Does it mean that I have to take ownership of the top folder including any sub folder/file and gave myself permission to all these files in order to avoid the above error? 
 ​
 Is there another way to do this? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

 Quick and easy from a random conversation today with a client/IT Tech who asked why this is not possible; 
 Client/IT - Purchased a lot of Windows 10 HOME devices (dont ask why)
 Client/IT has staff using E3 and E5 licenses
 Client/IT wants to purchase a single Windows 10 Pro license and use it to upgrade all HOME devices to PRO and then join the device to Azure to make it change from Pro to Enterprise using the single key from before.
 Is this remotely possible and even allowed or they talking hyperbole BS to me ? 
 Note, we do some of their MSP but they have their own inhouse IT who do more comms, radios, rock breaking and digging stuff and its their environment, we just help them out from time to time.

 The Duracell battery that I need is:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening,
 A few months ago, I replaced a bunch of Catalyst 2960S switches in our environment with new Cisco 9200L series switches. The swapover went well in general, but recently our users have started complaining about intermittent VOIP quality issues. I'm assuming a simple QoS policy will resolve the issue, but I'm having some issues understanding how I should go about it.
 We have two switch stacks. Three switches in a stack in one building with our ISP routers, two switches in a stack in our other building. A 10G fiber uplink connects the switch stacks between buildings.
 We have a VOIP Vlan set to Vlan 100. Most user access ports have both the VOIP Vlan and general data VLAN (200) configured. Ex:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3 switchport access vlan 200 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 100 spanning-tree portfast 
 Our phones are older Polycom devices, not Cisco.
 I've read up on Cisco Auto QoS, but I've also read it's not the most efficient way of implementing QoS. Especially in an environment that isn't using Cisco phones. I started a support case with Cisco, but they just sent me the Auto QoS documentation I already have...
 Can anyone help me understand what should be done here? Is there a way I can just tell the switch "prioritize anything on Vlan 100"? What about the uplink between switches? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those that have had a ‘traditional’ networking career trajectory, meaning working in a NOC -> planning/implementation -> architect, do you think working in the NOC was fundamental to your growth?
 For context, I’m a networking grad in Canada that was hired at a big bank on the network provisioning/management team (which I think is a tier/level above the NOC), and so I’m wondering if I’m missing out on valuable networking experience not starting in a NOC.
 I do have my CCNA and I can confidently say I know the fundamentals, but will it be a big hindrance that I didn’t start out in a NOC. Or will working on my current team expose me eventually to the common and fundamentals of enterprise networking through implementing changes/sitting in on meeting, etc.
 Would also love to hear from those who have not worked in a NOC and how your career has gone.

I do TV installing and other entry level tech needs but I have a client who needs a new TV that works at a university that uses WPA2 enterprise I believe. You select the wifi network and it requires a username and a password. 
 From what I was reading is it any device that supports 802.11 and up supported but I could very well be wrong. They are needing a new TV and would like to connect it for smart features. 
 Hope this made sense and appreciate any insight

 I was offered a support role paying a couple grand more than I currently make, and it’s remote. I’m currently attending college for Cybersecurity. I’ve learned a lot in my role, but it’s a lot during school.

 Our current CISO area is consistently shooting other IT software requests in the foot. We have a current workflow where they are approving/disapproving software for use within our company, however recently they have denied things that would be free or alternatives to SnagIt (think ShareX or Greenshot), KeePass (they suggested LastPass Enterprise), as well as denied VLC with no available suitable replacement.
 Our IT teams are 100% impacted by these disapprovals and the CISO team are not keeping our asset mgmt team in mind, nor our users in mind. I'm currently not in a full sysadmin role but we do wear a certain hat in it.
 We've communicated that we want to get these and other software approved as enterprise solutions where the end-user can have 1-2 options for the most common requests we get. Unfortunately, they have legal and the privacy team involved which just seem to align with whatever our CISO says. I've never seen any of the 3 teams contradict. Keep in mind that they are all approved by our Chief Technology Office for security review.

 Hi r/sysadmin,
 Just wanted to report on an issue i had this morning in case anyone else runs into it.
 Sit:
 Brand new Dell T440 running Windows 2022. All OS and firmware updates applied (thank you iDRAC!)
 System is stand-alone on a LAN2 network leg. No other devices are on the same subnet other than the internal leg of the firewall.
 Installed domain services
 Promoted system to be a DC, reboot, etc.
 Issue:
 Ethernet was showing as public or private but not as Domain. (Single port , 2nd is currently disabled)
 Normal fix of restarting Network Location Awareness and Network list service failed (NL hang)..
 Multiple reboots did not work although i could always log onto the console using the domain credentials.
 ​
 Fixes tried:
 Turned on preference for ipv4 over ipv6
 Downgraded the network drivers, Upgraded the network drivers, played with Ethernet metrics (temp fix only)
 EDIT:
 Set NLA to Delayed start (did NOT help)
 Fix that worked:
 Set a dependency for DNS for the NLA service in the registry.
 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc
 DependOnService -add DNS to the list
 Reboot. Problem solved.
 However the system still says Metered (even though it does not appear to be turned on, can download, full speed tests, etc.). I found references to this problem but no solutions so far if anyone has any ideas.
 Hope this saves someone else some precious time.

 I'm not adverse to buying new software for this, however I generally am not a fan of niche software that isn't integrated with the rest of our systems.
 An ideal system would allow for certain people to update policies, but most (or all) employees being able to see the policies. It must either integrate with M365 or just be a solution native to the platform. Ideally folks would be able to track changes to the policy with different versions to see what's changed, and maybe get an alert when there is a new or updated policy.
 I figure I could do most of this with SharePoint but feels like I'd be building a lot of it from scratch. Any thoughts on what works well for you? I assume there are a lot of people frustrated by this and a lot of people thinking to themselves, "If I could build this all over again I'd do it this way...." so come at me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, here is a layout of this site:
 ​
 3 poweredge 730's, ESXi 6.5
 A NAS Datastore using iSCSI
 1 isolated network switch for communications between the hosts/datastores
 ​
 Yesterday, one of our remote sites had the strangest issues, I am still trying to make sense of it.
 Around 10am, I got a message that one of the hosts had a ConnectionStateAlarm. I remoted in and checked vsphere and sure enough, one of the three hosts at that site had a connection state issue. I acknowledged the alarm and checked the VPN circuit. It was pegged out (some type of NAS backup was running, this is not unusual). I cancelled the backup and the circuit went back to a normal state.
 I was thinking that host 1 would come back but it never did. I tried signing into ESXi through the web interface for the host, but the connection would time out on the page after putting in my credentials and hitting login. Tried SSH and I would get a connection refused. Logged in through iDRAC, rebooted the host. It came up without issue.
 So then, this happens on another host, we will call it host 2. Same deal, same site. I also cannot log into ESXi. I ended up getting into the iDRAC and rebooting the host. When it came up, it resynced and all was well. 
 FAST FORWARD AN HOUR LATER.
 I get an alarm that the third host is down and that an HA Event had failed. I logged in, one of my datastores is inaccessible and the third host is now down. This one, I cannot even get into the iDRAC, web interface or SSH.
 I got someone that was near the site to go and reboot the host manually from the rack, it came back up without issue. As for the datastore, I went into the connection & multipathing screen and had to manually mount it back to the first 2 hosts that we rebooted.
 All is back up and no alarms. I had generated support bundles to have VMWare check on this monday. Wow what a Saturday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to simulate a distributed fault-tolerant system consisting of multiple nodes. Each node runs a set of tasks or processes. Tasks communicate with each other by passing messages over the nodes' gates. I want to simulate a fault-tolerant mechanism where a node can fail and the system reconfigures itself by migrating tasks on the faulty node to other healthy nodes. I already developed an algorithm for migrating tasks but I want to test it with OMNeT++. 
 ​
 In the NED file, I have defined the network with the different nodes as submodules and tasks as submodules of the nodes (sub-submodules). But I can't connect the tasks with each other. 
 How can I simulate this behavior? Is there a better simulation tool than OMNeT++ for this use case?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this question we will explore the dynamics of two flows using the AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) and later AIAD (additive increase, additive
 decrease) algorithm instead of AIMD. Consider the topology shown in which two hosts A and B are sending packets to D through router R. 
 The bottleneck link in the path from R to D runs at 10 MB/s (i.e. 10 Megabytes per second). The RTTs from A to D and B to D are 100 ms. Assume that both A and B can
 communicate with R instantaneously and with arbitrarily large rate. Assume that each packet has a length of 1250 bytes and the buffer on router R can hold 200
 packets.
 Suppose that at time t = 0, host A has a congestion window of 999 packets, B has a congestion window of 0, and R’s buffer is empty. You should assume that packet
 drops are always experienced by the flow with more packets in flight. You should assume that each flow updates its congestion window after each RTT, decreasing it if
 any packet was dropped, and increasing it otherwise.
 AIMD: We first consider the evolution of the system when each flow is governed by AIMD, in which the congestion window grows by being incremented and shrinks by
 being halved (rounding down). In roundtrips 0 through 3, the system evolves as shown in the table below with host A exceeding the given congestion window size and
 accordingly reducing CWND to half in the next iteration. 
 Now, suppose that instead we are using an AIAD protocol. In this case, every drop decreases the congestion window by 5 packets (to a minimum of 1 packet) instead
 of halving the congestion window. What is the congestion windows size of host A at t = 300 RTTs? Give your answer in packets. 
 The solution states, it should be 300 but I do not understand why and there is nothing else provided.

 The printer is set up using the RAW mode, and the port is standard port 9100.
 The driver is "Generic / Text Only" It might take 10s to 60s or more to print labels.
 It also stops regularly between labels to think about what to do next.
 Should this device use port RAW or LPR to get optimal efficient printing speed?
 I also see some weird TCP handshake issues in the firewall logs. Not sure is it related to this issue... 
 Does somebody have special black magic sorcery skills to the Zebra printers?

I was expecting to receive the message on the device but didn't, that's why I suspect the reason might be because they use different cellular technology (one 3G and the other 4G).

 I've been working in IT for about 15 total years in some capacity. (Freelance and Professional or Contract) Education: Associates in Computer Science /COMPTIA A+ / Network+ / Security+
 I've been working in Data Center roles and lower level engineer roles for some extremely large companies over the last 6 years now and my salary has increased by about $19/hr from 2018 until now. 
 I started out at $11/hr in 2016 Most recent role - $33/hr by end of 2022
 About to start a new job in a week or two, but I got blindsided by another offer from a different company while I'm waiting for my equipment in the mail, sliding me about $15,000 more a year.
 I've been making between $55,000 - $72,000 per year through my last 3/4 positions I've held and have gained a lot more experience during these last few years as well. 
 I'm currently about to start a new job, I am being offered $70,000/yr and about to begin onboarding/training for this role before Feb 15th. However I was just offered another role through a different company, fully remote sysadmin for about $85,000/yr. 
 My questions are mainly... based on anyone else's experience in sysadmin work in the Midwest, should I try to aim for closer to $90k based on my experience? 
 Should I just shut up and take the money?? Or should I aim higher for somewhere between $90k-$100k?
 (This is my first time specifically doing work with a "sysadmin" title, but been performing the same work through other roles I've held in recent years)
 I've looked up some Glassdoor avg salaries for the title but it was a pretty wide range, something like 55k-120k/yr?
 If anyone can help me out with this I'd really appreciate it as I'm trying to pursue making a big change in my life and move towards settling down and building a family with my fiancee. Whatever role will end up offering more in terms of salary and job happiness will be more important to me.

They are offering me more than I have now and a true engineer position. I have only been with the new company for 2 months and have never been a job hopping person. I loved where I left, but with some political work there may be some potential for the new company. Tho it was going from CLI to Meraki Dashboard. I am stuck as to what I should do to progress my career. I have an engineer I am working with now who has been here for 10+ years with no progression. 
 I guess my question is should I leave for even more experience in cli with my last company or should I just stay for now and try to change this companies' climate and maybe learn more meraki?

My first instinct was to buy the beefiest UPS we can afford, but I have had a UPS die in a puff of smoke. It would be a cruel twist of fate if the backup battery that we installed to maintain emergency communications started a fire and harmed my mother.
 I notice that there are UPSs that are marketed specifically for telecom equipment, such as those listed here:
 https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/products/telecom/indoor/ 
 I notice that these are rather expensive given their output compared to UPSs sold for computers. Is there something special about them? 
 - For example are they optimized for providing lower power over more time? This would make sense for network equipment, whereas computer UPSs are made to keep a desktop computer going at full power for just enought time to shut down. Or would a bigger UPS designed for a computer simply last longer when powering low-power devices?
 ​
 - Might there be safety/fire precautions on these that aren't on regular UPSs? 
 - Any other reasons I might pay extra per watt of power output for one of thse "telecom" UPSs?

The current game that Im working with needs a small public facing file host for a patcher. Ive tried dropbox, google drive, and even github, but I cant seem to get the damn thing to communicate with those. 
 It's been suggested that I use a small vps with a public facing file folder. Problem is I have no idea how to set that up, and less of an idea as to who to host with. The files themselves are a total of maybe 10-15mb, but will be downloaded multiple times a day. 
 Thoughts? Suggestions?

Back story is that someone in our organization purchased a pair of 24Y4Cs for a new building/second data center on our primary network and I came across their purchase about a year after it was purchased. (The building isn’t complete yet, so I had them purchase the correct Nexus 93180YC-FX3s for their data center core so that way they can mirror our design/configs.) Anyway, I told management I’ll repurpose these expensive ass switches for our other network we are going to be rebuilding, so they’ll be serving as a datacenter core to a set of two 9300 access switches one for each floor.

Whenever, a user is logged in using a smart card or tries to log in using a smart card, certain services can no longer be restarted, such as the print spooler. We get error 1747, the authentication service is unknown. Nothing we have tried has resolved the issue except not installing ActivClient. The most interesting thing is that machines that were loaded with 21H2 that already have ActivClient installed are them work fine if we do an in-place upgrade on them to 22H2. The issue only occurs on cleanly loaded machines. Has anyone ever seen anything like this, and is anyone running ActivClient on Windows 11 22H2?

 Anyways, I tried the classic pressing "mode" button during power-on. Despite me giving all my might and pressing/holding for upwards of a minute, the switch does not seem to enter the "switch:" prompt. It always boots normally. I tried different permutation of 5 seconds, 15, seconds, pressing mode when I unplug power, then continuing to hold when I plug power back in, etc.
 I explored other alternatives by breaking the boot. But that doesn't seem to work either - when I'm consoled in, using firstly PuTTY, then Teraterm and sending break commands didn't work either.
 When it boots, I do see a message: The password-recovery mechanism is enabled.
 But it continues to boot normally into a configuration of a password I cannot remember.
 Any guidance would be appreciated.

 Backup the old profiles: On the Windows Server 2012R2, open the File Explorer and navigate to the folder where user profiles are stored. This folder is typically located in C:\Users. Right-click on the folder and select "Export" to backup each user profile.

The objective is to create corresponding setup guides and compile the necessary lab setup resources together for the team's future use. Our repository hasn't been updated since the system's deployment. Right now, I'm working on the setup of a particular server in the lab, which was only introduced during the system's mid-life upgrade. As such, there were no setup documentation for it and I had to reverse engineer the existing server to make guides for it from scratch.
 One of the software deployed in the system is SharePoint Portal Server 2003. It took me a while to realise that the version deployed in production is updated to Service Pack 3, but I only have the base version's installer. I searched high and low and haven't been able to find the SP3 installer anywhere in my office's repositories. The official download link from Microsoft is dead too.
 Does anyone know where I can get this file (likely named SPS2003SP3-kb923644-fullfile-ENU.exe - KB923644), or where I can go to ask? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm still new to networking and haven't experienced too much with Public DNS records. 
 but for information, the design is that there are 2 DNS servers setting between the Router and the Firewall. The Router is in front so the structure is ISP - Router - DNS - Firewall - Internal Network. 
 This external DNS keeps the Host and only Host A files that lets the internet know that website A is IP whatever for the college. 
 I believe the DNS servers forward the traffic to Quad9 or something like that, not sure why, but if some one can assist to the reason, I'm sure its a verification method or something to proof that we are the actual college we are advertising or to tell other larger DNS providers know who we are if some one form another state tries to reach our website. 
 So on to my question. Is there a better way? I would like to move our records off site to something like cloud flair. However I set up a meeting with them and they said the minimum they covered was for websites that hit 1 million hits per month. Obviously its a community college in a rural area so we get around 17,000 hits. Then they wanted $20,000 a year. 
 Now I was trying to keep my cool, but choking inside, so I didn't get a chance to clarify, but I think they thought I wanted some of the premium features and such when really I just wanted to host A records so we had a cloud DNS and if that's just a free thing or if we have to pay a fee. I think it was confusion because the prices on the website did not match up to what they were telling me. 
 Can any one clarify if Cloud Flair is free to host records and all I have to do is just verify that we are who we say we are? 
 or really any better solution to external DNS hosting or is it fine the way we have it set up?

I’m a Network Administrator in the Marine Corps with 7ish years of experience and debating on leaving once my contract is up in a couple of years because I don’t want to move around anymore. I’m just worried I’m not going to enjoy what I do once I get out because currently I get to work on a lot of equipment and it’s honestly a lot of fun. I’m also curious if anyone has a role/job somewhat similar to what I do? For instance, at a typical training exercise I get to setup an equipment string supporting about 50-200 users which includes a Satellite Transmissions System or fiber connection and connect it to my router which connects via DMVPN to a NOC and pull services from there. I also get to setup/configure all switches to other offices (tents) to end devices and some encryption equipment and VoIP thrown in there as well. Usually it’s me and 1-2 other people doing all of this and we get a lot of time configuring which I enjoy. So I guess I’m just curious if anyone gets exposed to a lot of different equipment or do you mainly stick to a specific area of configuration? Thanks!

 We are looking to setup something unique and get two firewalls setup behind our Comcast EDI. The challenge we are having is we need to route are usable block of /27 to different WAN /29 address on two firewalls.
 Comcast has given us
 P2P IP:xxx.xxx.xxx.232/29 Gateway (.233) Comcast router Customer Layer 3 (.234)Customer Useable IP’s: xxx.xxx.xxx.235 – xxx.xxx.xxx.238
 and we have Usable EDI Static Range: yyy.yyy.yyy.225-.254 and this is 255.255.255.224 or /27
 I think that Comcast sends our Usable range to the xxx.xxx.xxx.234 address. 
 What I have tried is to assign the .234 to a VLAN on our Dell N4000 switch with routing enabled. Then I assigned .235 and .236 to WAN interface on each firewall.
 Our issue comes when trying to setup a route in the table to send yyy.yyy.yyy.226 to the .235 ip. We are going to have to send different usable to the different firewalls. The switch complains that the rout is invalid, which makes sense since its a different network.
 Lots of people suggest getting an EdgeRouter X, would that let me do this?
 Any suggestions on getting our switch to do this type of routing?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross posting this from r/askanelectrician since it is specific to server hardware.
 Context:
 I have a server PSU that seems to only work with a C13/C14 cord. The specs of the server PSU are:
 Edit: Here is a picture of the PSU: https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/static/media/9198938f-8c47-5a0e-82d9-6db6a62cd3f7/DAM-ccd92840-c3fa-4d5c-9c55-cf231e6069f4/out/2711.024.jpg
 Max input power: 100 to 240 VAC +/- 10%, single phase
 AC line current: 10.6A @ 100 VAC, 5.3 A @ 200 VAC
 AC Inlet Type: IEC320-C14 (high-line, 200 VAC), IEC320-C20 (low-line, 100 VAC)
 Issue:
 I have a 120V PDU that has NEMA 5-20 receptacles (L5-30 input). The PSU will not power on with a C13/NEMA 5-15 or C13/NEMA 5-20 cord. I want to use this PDU.
 I also have a 200-240V PDU (L6-30 input) with C14 inputs. The PSU works when using a C13/C14 cord in this PDU. I don't want to use this PDU.
 Question:
 Can someone give a quick explanation of these power requirements/specs on the PSU? My interpretation is that the PSU supports 120V thus a NEMA 5-15/NEMA 5-20 cable should be enough to power the PSU.
 Am I misinterpreting the specs or does the PSU have some sort of sensing ability to know that an IEC plug is not being used? FWIW, daisy-chaining C13/C14 into C13/NEMA x also doesn't work.
 Edit:
 I have talked to Dell about this and they suggested getting a C13/NEMA 5-20P cable. I did and it still didn't work.

Like we CANNOT get them off no matter how hard we try.
 We have installed the latest version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. and Remote Desktop WebRTC Redirector Service installer.
 The errors we see on the VM for Teams:

Does Teams need to be updated? Does Team just suck? Is this a service issue with Microsoft?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have recently been trying to find out a deep dive into what exactly networking ports are. This is regarding TCP and UDP ports.
 Whenever I search what exactly are networking ports, I see explanations about how they are a way to identify a service. 
 I have not seen explanations on how this is achieved.
 When a server receives a request on port 22, the TCP/IP stack inspects the destination port, and sees the number 22 there. Is the TCP/IP stack configured in such a way that each port number must be associated with a certain service, like if the number is 22, then forward the request to the sshd service?
 After the TCP/IP stack inspects the port number, will it forward the request to the relevant service - sshd in this case?
 I have thought of ports as "gates" to remotely access a service. Each service has its own PID, but this PID stays local, so ports are a way to access these services remotely. We won't be able to remotely access the service by its PID. But we can access the service if there is a TCP/IP stack that does the forwarding of request based on the destination port number?
 The questions above are just my own explanation of how ports are bound to services, and how the TCP/IP stack assists in forwarding the request to the relevant service. If anybody has knowledge in this, it would be great for someone to share it.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/sysadmin!
 I can't wrap up my mind around this. Earlier this week at my workplace I had a iSCSI target from a Synology RackStation RS3614xs+ NAS (DSM 6.2.2-24922) suddenly disconnect overnight on a Windows Server. When I started investigating after noticing the issue, DSM tells me in the storage manager that "There is no volume in your system". 12-disk RAID6 is fine, alive and healthy, S.M.A.R.T. of all disks displays a "Normal/Healthy" status so nothing to worry about I think (only 1 disk mentioned 1 bad sector at the time after the sudden target disconnect). Storage pool is also operating normally from what DSM shows.
 I can still access the target, the data is still there but this volume "missing" in DSM is getting me a little worried.
 Every other RackStation NAS (configured with iSCSI/LUNs) we have currently running and everything I see on the web says that on a Synology NAS a LUN is located on a volume (like Volume 1) and not straight on a storage pool.
 I'm no expert in storage topics and still learning but everything I see in my investigation of the issue points in the direction that this is not a normal behavior. I searched on the web for a similar experience and cannot find cases where LUNs point straight to storage pool location instead of like an ext4 volume for example.
 What are your thoughts about this?
 Please let me know if additional context and details (even logs or output of CLI commands) are needed.
 Thanks in advance for your insight, and have a nice day!

I have our active CSP headers so when I added our domain it is in a new CSP Report only. But I keep getting the error that the directive name contains one or more invalid characters. I’ve double checked to make sure there wasn’t an exception xtra space or anything and cannot get it to work. This is what I have now:

 Also, I fully understand the reliability, scalability, security, future proofing aspect. What I’m not getting is why fiber was chosen as the sole connection method when the devices we support aren’t there yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'll to explain this best as iI can.
 I've got two WAN connections in a failover arrangement:
 WAN1 FTTP
 WAN2 5G failover
 VLANs:
 1 10 20 30 200
 In the UI dashboard its not giving accurate info on how much data is flowing between the different vlans... is this normal?
 so lets say the sky glass is active and pulling 20Mbps I would expect it to show this via the IoT vlan but it does not.
 also the traffic analysis tab does not show hardly any data for any nodes connected. for example i have run about 10 speed tests and downloaded a 1.1gb iso from my pc, yet it only shows 7.86MB of data logged.
 is this just a bug with the EdgerouterX?
 TIA
 ​
 Edit: so this is apparently because the interfaces only show the overhead of the vlans and not total traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many years ago I used to look after some Postfix servers and then 365 came along and all that went away.
 I've got a requirement where I think Postfix would be ideal I just can't find/remember the exact term in Postfix for what I want to do so would appreciate a little reminder 😀
 I need a Postfix box on an internal LAN to accept mail from the internal /24 and if it's for @domain1.com or @domain2.com to forward it onto a smart host (the smart host will accept and relay from the IP of the Postfix box so no need to authenticate).
 However if it's for anythingelse.com I only want it to relay it using the same smart host if it comes from certain IPs within the internal /24.
 So mail from 192.168.1.0/24 to domain1.com or domain2.com = accept and relay.
 Mail from 192.186.1.10 and 192.168.10.15 to anydomain.com = accept and relay.
 There are no local mailboxes in use.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 Last year I was hired by a company here Denmark to be an IT admin and recently I was given the task to build a troubleshooting lab for the Network/Security engineers.
 The objective of this lab is so that when they face a problem with a customer's device (which is in production), they can quickly spin up a VM in our lab environment and run tests on it.
 We will use a single server running VMware EXsi for the VMs.
 Ideally I would like to give the engineers the freedom to create their own VMs using some type of GUI (instead of keeping that extra administrative work for myself), but I also want to restrict them from creating a ridiculous amount of VMs, or assigning a ridiculous amount of resources to the VMs, and Ideally this would all have AAA (so I can know who created what and when).
 What tools do you recommend for a setup like this? This is my first time leading a project like this and I am a bit lost !
 Thank you in advance!

 I already opened a post, for another question. This one is partly a rant, but also partly a call for help.
 This is about an argument I had with my colleague. I don't know where he comes up with such ideas.
 We tasked to conceptualize a new ip address concept for our location. We have 200-250 employees, everyone with notebooks and smartphones. In total we come up with 500~ unique ip addresses.
 We don't expect to grow much, because we are limited by the size of our offices.
 We have 3 buildings, each with 3 floors. I rather expect, that we will build smaller branched offices in the future, if we ever fill up our current location.
 Thats all fine. Basic stuff. Thats like the 1,2,3 of a sysadmin. I did stuff like that in school and got tasks like this even as an exam …]]></summary>

 We will have a small time frame coming up in the school system with no students or teachers.
 Trying to find a solution to-Have most of the fleet's Windows laptops always up to date with their patches and etc.(as close as possible)-Able to keep the laptops updated all the time-Don't need staff/us to run to every laptop all the dam time to update it ourselves this takes a really long time. There's just too many laptops
 Solution I was thinking- We will go to every laptop this time make sure we push the bios config to power on every Sunday- SCCM will do the updates for us just like how we always been..
 Any recommendations or advice as well from your own solutions that is keeping your laptop's updated in their carts? Any GPO's that we can push to the laptops as well. The laptops are always plugged with power via the usb-c power adapters. We have ap's in every room that has a laptop cart.
 Its just getting tiresome to do all hunt down the ones that hasn't been patched manually as the #of laptops is growing and its not all in the same building. Thanks for your help and any advice is welcome.

I understand how load balancing will can be used to send requests to multiple servers so that one server is not overloaded. But the part I don't understand is how do you make the servers always be duplicates of each other? For example if it's cloud storage, one person edits or uploads a new version of the a file, how does the other servers know there was a change? And how do you make sure they are all up to date with the latest changes? 
 I don't understand how you setup the replication portion of it. 
 Can someone point me into he right direction to understand this?

 I seek for aid in conceptualizing a new network for my company.
 During my conversations with my colleague we came up with the question where to put the default gateway of our subnets.I remember that my old teacher back in school told me, to put the default gateway at the end of a subnet. e.g. 192.168.178.254/24 I can't remember why again. Something with growth and expansion of the network. I can't get it together anymore.
 Though, from my old companies I know that they all put their default gateway at the beginning of a network, e.g. 192.168.178.1/24
 What do you think? Is there an actual reason for the one or the other, or is it just personal preference?
 Thank you very much!

 But I figure if anyone has been around long enough in technology that remembers anything about this, its like Sysadmin and perhaps a handful of Guru's here. 
 So from 2018-2020 I worked for a Newspaper IT department in my first real IT job .
 To place our ads we used a certain program and boy howdy this sucker was old.
 I never got a specific timeframe on its age , I heard some staff saying they had seen a version of it or something similar to it when they worked in the 70's/80's, I knew support for it ended like in 2009 and the interface was pure keyboard based and looked like something something that would not have been out of place on DOS with its blocky text and minimal colors.
 I am fairly certain we were the last company in the world using it, we had to modify it to work on modern Mac OSX and windows machines , run it deep in wineskin.
 The thing was so old, that whenever it crashed or corrupted the staff just installed a fresh zipped copy on the affected workstation and it was so small that you could transfer it quickly, even on a Apple Remote Desktop setup, it transferred in like 10-15 seconds. 
 Now I am not sure if our versions name was changed after all the modifying or all the companies assets were barely online, but when I search for it (mostly to share with people to show them the older stuff I have worked on), all I get is info on cameras or wall mountings.
 ​
 Was curious if anyone knows what I am talking about and its proper name or even some screenshots of it in all of its DOS glory.
 Not a big deal, but I thought I'd ask

 The service consists of the following terminals:
  
Forty (40) Personales Computers with Windows 10 (1 Standard user and 1 administrator user for restriction on each PC). 
 Printers and access points (At the moment I am not interested in this point). 
  
I need to implement a:
  
Ticket System (because currently I only use Gmail to manage orders.) Which do you recommend? Where possible free.
 A software for remote access to the terminals. I currently use TeamViewer. I was looking at Radmin, maybe TW will change it to Radmin. What do you think? I like the Radmin interface better and how little intrusive it is.
 
A software to monitor the network. Here I am adrift, any recommendations or advice? The network consists of a Mikrotik Router, a main non-manageable Switch and then an access Switch per floor that distributes to the terminals via UTP Cat5e. 
 
Any other point that they consider necessary to implement...
 A simple network schematic...
 
 What I appreciate most are the advice or experiences. I read in Google and use Udemy to learn right now, I survived out of necessity. But I want to start professionalizing myself and professionalize my modest system.
 Thank you in advance.
 ¡Gracias!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for an option for re-deploying some Surface Go tablets as wall mounted Spotify kiosks. I've tried the usual UWP kiosk powershell in Windows but Spotify is strange in that it appears it is now an plug-in for the xbox game bar UWP app. It can't be found in the GUI to set up a kiosk app, and if you try to run SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Spotify it just gets stuck in a loop until I remote powershell in and remove the kiosk setting. If you use SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Widget it displays "We weren't able to start your app." and an error code which indicates an operation was not supported.
 I've considered Edge fullscreen but the web-based can only cast to Spotify Connect devices they've previously registered and as this is at a school, giving access to an unauthenticated web browser is something I'd rather avoid.
 Another potential is BlissOS (Androidx86) but then I need to put in time to get that working with an MDM if it is even possible.
 If I can get it working, I'll design a secure-ish wall mount and 3D print as many as needed. (we have 30 of them) I was also considering using them for control panels for certain building automations (is there a more commercial focused option like homeassistant?) and also for using with Xibo for digital signage.
 Background: I'm the solo IT person for a special school, always looking for cheaper ways of doing things which make these kids' lives a bit better. The more I can save, the more I can spend on IT based programs which help their learning. If I had loads of money, I'd just buy iPads for this. Reason we have Surface Go is we're a 100% windows school, no apple, no Google Apps Suite Workspace.

 Is there anything else than needs to be done to make this work?
 Is there any method to view which user account or accounts logons are currently cached on a device?

 I'm not opposed to working for one but my fear is the bureaucracy and process. I'm in a very large organization right now and don't like the sheer size and complexity of the environment just to get something done. I'm afraid a defense contractor would be the same simply because they're working with the military. 
 I don't have a clearance but don't think I'd have a problem getting one.

We don’t have a ton of servers that are doing a whole lot. Most of time time is spent on our network. I took over a role that has not been too well defined. My boss pretty much hired me not knowing my technical skills, and thought that if I didn’t do well technically than I could at least be the IT project manager. 
 I’m the only Sys admin, and there are two help desk guys who don’t know really anything about servers or networking. I take some escalations, but not many.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a hilarious scenario at a school I provide IT support for.. Its one of those things that happen in IT where if I were to tell someone they would instantly think it was bs. And in the moment you don't quite believe whats happening yourself.
 So, this school they have a 40mbps VDSL line. As you can imagine with over 200 devices on the network at times this is pretty slow. Today the download speed was 0.4 mbps with a 800ms ping. How they survive on this I will never know. I'm constantly trying to get them to upgrade to fibre but they just do not have the budget to do that. There network equipment is a mess too, they have a Dell Sonicwall router about 12 year old and Cisco switches from about 10 years ago. They recently upgraded a couple of switches to unifi and how have unifi ac pro access points.
 ​
 Today I was going round seeing if anyone had any issues in their classrooms and a staff member approached me asking why they had been asked to turn off ALL devices in their class. I walked around and everybody was turning all their devices off, it felt like apocalypse scene in a movie. The person who told them to turn everything off I went and asked her why this had happened and her response was "I needed to download a large file and the internet is too slow". I couldn't stop laughing. I had never heard of anything so outrageous in my life. The funny thing was, 75% devices dropped off the network and the speed was 2mbps download. 
 ​
 Its so hard working with schools to improve their tech when they quite literally don't have the budget to upgrade stuff. They upgraded their servers a couple years ago but that was because they literally failed constantly.
 ​
 Thought this story was too funny not to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context I am mainly a wireless guy (RF design/testing), with some light networking background. I am looking at rolling out a new Meraki 9164 access point deployment. It is my understanding that to use 6 GHZ and 802.1X authentication I am required to use WPA3-Enterprise encryption (Also see Meraki article titled "WPA3 Encryption and Configuration Guide". With WPA2-Enterprise I was able to use EAP-PEAP MS-Chapv2, but I am getting the feeling that PEAP MS-Chapv2 is not supported on WPA3 Enterprise? Meraki's article states:
 To use WPA3 enterprise, the RADIUS servers must use one of the permitted EAP ciphers:
  
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  
So I am hoping to find the answer to a few questions:
  
Does WPA3 Enterprise support only EAP-TLS?
 
Is this ubiquitous to all WPA3 enterprise deployments? (standards based requirement)
 If WPA3 Enterprise supports supports other EAP types, what are those? Source would be great!
 As I am not very familiar with EAP-TLS, does that mean I would be required to have Server AND CLIENT certificates?
 
Are there any straightforward guides to learning more about EAP-TLS and how to deploy?
  
Thanks for any insight!

 Would it make sense to create one Network SSID to apply to devices at all locations at once or is that even possible?
 The problem we are having is that we are running out of DHCP leases on our current wireless network and would like to sparse out users/devices so that more IPs will become available.
 Should we have a unique scope/VLAN created for each location separately or would it be possible/more efficient to have the entire wireless network we are creating for all locations being associated with just one scope/VLAN?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 In my assignment I have to design a network with following components:
  
Firewall (Fortigate) x 2 
  
ISP #1 (Primary) 
 ISP #2 (Secondary/Backup) 
 Backbone Switch x 2 
 Switch Stack (3 switches) 
 Network Printer 
 Server 
 Laptop - using WiFi 
 Access Points - 2 Units 
 
  
Configuration: 
 ● Both of the firewalls should be in cluster (HA) 
 ● Both ISP’s should be in active-passive mode with dependency with the firewall cluster. 
 ● Each device(server, printer, AP, laptop) should have its own VLAN and be isolated from the other devices. 
 ● Backbone & Stack switches should be on the same VLAN as the laptop. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I drew up this diagram: https://ibb.co/fxnWW51
 What is the best practice for this kind of network?
 Where i get confused is - where would you configure routing and interVLAN traffic? On Fortigate or core switches. In my research I'm getting mixed suggestions - Some say that core switches are for routing, when others say that core switches have to be as fast as possible and have minimal tasks dedicated to them.
 I would appreciate any kind of help, and sorry for stupid questions.

 We have a C9200L-48P-4X which has a single port, which happens to be empty, in an up state with a solid amber light. The switch sees itself as a cdp neighbor on this port, showing the same port ID for both sides:
 usnosw12-113#sh cdp n Device ID Local Intrfce Holdtme Capability Platform Port ID usnosw12-113 Gig 1/0/2 165 S I C9200L-48 Gig 1/0/2 
 There's no config on the port. I'm thinking it's just a repair case but I wanted to ask in case there's a chance it's something else.

Open Registry Editor
 Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RasMan\PPP\EAP\13
 Create DWORD key TlsVersion value FC0
 Gpupdate /force
 reboot
  
Done
 ​
 Weird problem.
 We have a couple users who snuck in and updated their machines to Windows 11 before we locked that down. We also have a group policy that we designed for Windows 10 that deploys the info for all the SSIDs across all offices to all computers. It is set to reach out to RADIUS to verify ID, so users never have to log in.
 This GPO works great on all Windows 10 machines, and according to our other SysAdmin, it worked fine for 11 until 22H2 dropped. Now, users see the network that was pushed by GPO, but it tells them they "Can't connect to this network".
 I can log in to one of the Win11 machines and manually tell it to get on the "Hidden Network" and give it all the info, and that manually configured one works fine.
 If I check the GPO on the Win11 machine, Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies and open the policy we created, then open the properties of the network, then go to the Security tab. I verify that it is using Secured Password (EAP-MSCHAP v2) as the Authentication Method and click Configure, but the EAP MSCHAPv2 properties window that pops up has the "When connecting: Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any) box unchecked and is greyed out. On the Win10 machines, though, that is checked.
 Given that, I'm assuming that the reason they can't connect is due to the Windows logon name and password not being pushed. Just not sure why the GPO isn't configuring that correctly in Windows 11.
 Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone have a problem with eve ng where MySQL logging appears abnormally high? It'll chew up 100s of meg's of disk space a day and my SSD hard drive is taking a lot of write cycles. Is there a way to turn that down or off?
 EDIT: I have eve-ng pro 5.0.1-20, it's recently installed. I think I helped my ssd out a little bit with these fixes:
  
edited these two lines in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
  
​
 # max_binlog_size = 100M skip-log-bin 
 Since I have no plans on making this a cluster server for eve in the future I just disabled the binlog/logbin feature. This partially helped my problem, I noticed slightly less disk IO, but there was still a lot. It maybe decreased things by 10-25%. But the overall disk usage will not continually climb from the /var/lib/mysql/binlog.xxxxxx files.
 iotop showed this yet: 567481 be/4 mysql 0.00 B/s 551.38 K/s ?unavailable? mysqld [ib_pg_flush_co]
 ib_pg_flush_co was still writing a lot. So I did an strace of that process and it was doing io_submit about once a second. I just happened to google the very last option in the mysqld.cnf file "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2". A quick google suggests that it forces a write cycle once a second.
  
 edited "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2" from 2 to 1 (the default), and restarted mysql again.
  
EDIT2: This only worked temporarily. After a reboot of the eve-ng box the issue came back. and ib_pg_flush_co is still writing to disk constantly.

 OPTION 1: Option 1

 Our data center sits in area 0. I am leaning towards setting things up the way it appears in option 2 to limit the OSPF traffic over the WAN. Are there any significant advantages of going option 1 over option 2?

 Ive started to read about the MPO/MTP and im slightly confused (somewhat).
 We are planning on connecting two switches together with the QSFP-40G-SR4-S and I have to order the correct leads.
 Since its a transceiver to-transceiver that would make it a type B connection. 
 According to the Cisco webstie it says:
 QSFP-40G-SR4-S
 40GBASE-SR4, 4 lanes, 850 nm MMF
 MPO-12
 Does it mean that when Im placing an order for the correct lead, it should be 8 fibres, Type B Cross polarity and Female to Female or Male to Male? Please help... TIA.

 He emails me back saying it still starts at log in. So, I used sysinternals to disable it. I continued to leave what was left installed and disabled as I didn't want to make a small complaint turn into a potential mess. 
 ​
 A program should not require sysinternals to disable a program at startup. A program should not persist after uninstalling it.

 Our org currently uses AnyConnect VPN for remote access. We have it configured for the Windows pre-logon as well, and we instruct people to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer. Our reasoning was because things like GPOs and logon scripts seemed to "work best" or even possibly only work if the user signed into the computer while being "on network"(with the VPN active).
 I have the ability to switch our AnyConnect VPN setup to have our firewall point directly to Azure for MFA purposes, but that config does not support the ability to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer. Wouldn't that be a problem again for logon GPOs and logon scripts?
 What do other orgs do to solve for this that have users sign into a VPN AFTER signing into their computer instead of before?

 Recently i've been hired as a server administrator for an IT company in my area. I got the job because my education background is in software development and they want to train me as a server admin + use my programming skills for powershell scripting & automation.
 The onboard training is totally fine, I'm comfortable in the M365 admin portal and AD seems straight forward enough, but where I have no actual training (outside of a brief course I took semester one) I was wondering if there are any recommended online courses? Through Udemy or somewhere else. When I was learning programming the Odin Project helped a lot with my understanding of the webdev side of things so I was hoping there's something similar for sys admin.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated, otherwise I'll just pick the highest rated course on Udemy lol.

I've been debating back and forth about applying for other jobs to at least test the market to see what I'm worth. I'm a Senior Monitoring Engineer and work with tools such as App Dynamics, Splunk, DataDog, etc. My wife and I have a baby on the way (our first and only) so I've been pondering if I should explorer other options to increase my salary.
 However, things are going very well where I work which is a good thing. The company I work at has been very stable, work life balance is excellent with typically no more then 40 hours per week, remote 4 days per week, have 6 weeks of vacation, and the other benefits (7% 401k matching, health care is under $200 a month for a family, bonus is usually around $7k) are good as well. I've seen some other job listings in my field would offer a good bump in pay but I'm hesitant to even leave. I start thinking "Is now the right time to really leave with the way the economy is", and "my wife and I having a baby on the way, stay where it's been stable". On the other hand I also think "I've been here nearly 15 years, let's see what's out there and what I'm worth". Maybe there's no harm in at least applying for some of these positions.
 What would you do? How much is stability, work life balance and remote work worth to you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I will start with saying I understand there are enterprise text solutions, but we already have cell phone numbers we are in contract for both phones and hosted voip..... That being the disclaimer..... the sales managers have said text your customers, the sales team did with great success and close deals.... Now they need to get away for a day or week for vacation or for health reasons..... We can't take care of the customer because they leave their cell phone at home. (I would too if I was on vacation)....
 So I am trying to get inside sales access to all their imessages for a small period of time. 
 I tried Verizon message plus, but deleting all history with a customer of a few years is a hard push back and you lose historical and disable imessage all together... Clunky. 
 I have found that if I take an iPhone with no service and hook it up to the wireless, sign into their icloud on the phone I can text! But I still have to deliver a spare iPhone to someone to cover..... I have thought about a virtual macos that people can remote into.... But before I reinvent the wheel again... Is there something easier? Anyone in my boat? Thanks redit kingdom

 I know the theory (mostly) and the commands, but what I'm struggling with is that I've been told that VLANs should each have their own subnet if best practices are followed which makes sense to me. 
 However as far as I'm aware you can't configure subnets on a layer two switch. It needs to either be a router, or a layer three switch.
 Bearing that in mind how is it possible to have multiple VLANs on a single layer two switch whilst ensuring that each VLAN has its own subnet. It doesn't seem possible to me.
 I asked my lecturer but found my questions leading in circles. The lecturer confirmed that you can't subnet ports on a layer two switch, but then when I said "So you can't have a subnet for each VLAN at the layer two switch then (unless you're only using one VLAN for all ports)?" and was told: "Yes you can". And repeat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a little data center that's growing and now have a little over 70 windows server VM's. Little tasks like do X, then repeat 70+ times are good for security but there must be a better way. Unfortunately we are on windows so all the linux thing's I'm thinking of aren't going to work.
 X could be any combination of these; 
  
start/stop service
 place a provided file in a location (not shared folder)
 read & report contents of a text file
 run a executable
 pretty much anything you can do CLI
  
For example at the moment I find myself updating OpenVPN. Place the provided msi in Downloads, stop the service, run the installer, check for installer errors, start service, after 1 minute delay open the OpenVPN log and review for errors. The error review in this case requires a human but if it simply dumped the log file somewhere I can get to it on a orchestration machine, renamed it with what server it came from that would be perfect. 
 I'm searching and finding a LOT of posts about automating windows updates, but I think we finally have WSUS under control.

 I've already created a guide for the actual process of setting up Win 11 on their new laptops, but I still wanted to create a little fact sheet of changes between Windows 10 and 11. This is for an insurance company, so the changes should be focused more on GUI changes rather than changes to things like performance or new widgets(for the most part, if the software isn't in our Company Portal, we don't want them installing it anyway). 
 I personally haven't used Win 11 that much(the project kind of got sprung on me short notice) so simply writing the differences I've noticed might not be too helpful and most articles I've read only give a nod towards look and feel changes then focus on things like gaming performance. 
 I don't mind doing the actual reading myself, so links will be enough, but if anyone has brief summaries of changes, that would also help immensely. Thanks in advance.

 I might need your insight here ! As we are moving out of sccm to WS1, our security department is quite demanding regarding our packaging standards.
 Basically, in our packages we might have "sensitive information" ( licence server , accounts , database ...) Plainly visible in scripts ( most of time we are using PSADT ) and they want us to encrypt / hide as much as possible these data. 
 File Encryption seems quite difficult to setup for such purposes (due to find a way to make the package usable through WS1, and decrypt it on devices !) , Hide through full encapsulation in .MST / MSI might cause tons of rework and aditiional loads... Any idea on your side ? Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we've got a bit of an annoying issue with some Windows 11 field devices. They use some in-built 4g connectivity when out and about.
 The issue is that when in patchy signal, the AOVPN tries a few times to connect and then stops trying to auto-connect.
 This appears to happen only for Windows 11 devices. There doesn't appear to be a GPO option to force the auto-connect functionality back on.
 Another issue is that we can't disable the option to untick 'Connect Automatically', so the user can untick it and the VPN won't automatically connect. Is there any GPO or setting that I'm missing which will help? 
 I'm aware that this is a 'minor' inconvenience which could be solved with User Training but management have insisted that these field engineers are dumb as bricks and will just complain so it's easier to just get the VPN to try all the time constantly.
 I'm looking into a scheduled task fired on Network Connection successful but wanted a second opinion. Any ideas?

 I'm the solo SysAdmin for a company of around 40. Our shipping, marketing and shop management branch moved out of a larger city, because we need space - a lot of it. Keeping inventory is expensive. Anyway, on to the story...
 Summer 2019
 My phone rings. It's my boss. They've got "exciting news to share" and call me into a meeting later that day. In the meeting, the announcement is made to the other higher-ups and everyone who's on the organizational crew: "We're moving. Here's the new address. It's a nice place, and..." so my first question was: Why do I only get wind of…]]></summary>

 I have a scenario that I need to get some clarity on as I cannot find any real answers online.
 We have Macbooks that are on Apple Business Manager and the company also wants to enrol them into Intune to deploy policies and profiles etc in line with company security policies. However, they would also like the Macbooks to be able to sign in with AAD credentials rather than AD credentials. Is it possible to link ABM with both Intune and AAD, rather than Intune and then configuration profiles to setup directory utility for AD?
 I see articles around setting up a Federation between ABM and AAD: Intro to federated authentication with Apple Business Manager – Apple Support (UK) but then is this the same as this: Tutorial: Configure Apple Business Manager for automatic user provisioning with Azure Active Directory - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn 
 With the above, can we then still utilise automatic enrolment into Intune with ABM like this: Enroll macOS devices - Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager | Microsoft Learn

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 We are making some changes to our environment in regards to allowing AAD groups to be synced on prem, basically so certain groups are mirrored across the board.
 However once we enabled group write back against a set of groups we started getting the following error.
 ​
 The sync rules in scope have a mix of Persistent and ExecuteOnce attribute flows for the same destination attribute: msExchMailboxGuid
 ​
 at Microsoft.MetadirectoryServices.SyncRulesEngine.JoinModule.ValidateAllApplicableSyncRules(IEnumerable\1 applicableSyncRules)`
 at Microsoft.MetadirectoryServices.SyncRulesEngine.JoinModule.Execute(PipelineArguments argsToProcess)
 at Microsoft.MetadirectoryServices.SyncRulesEngine.Server.SyncEngine.RunSyncPipeline(SyncRulePipelineArguments pipelineData, List\1 pipelineChain)`

 at ManagedSyncRulesEngine.Synchronize(ManagedSyncRulesEngine* , CCsObject* sourceCsObject, CMvObject* mvObject, SynchronizationOperation operation, Char** error)
 InnerException=>
 none
 Native call stack: 
 ​
 Not exactly sure what this is? I assume its to do with us pointing on prem AD to look at mailboxes in Azure? we had no choice to do this as our move to Azure was in an emergency response.
 ​
 Any suggestions, currently we are just wanting to get the basic sync between on-prem and AAD working until we can figure out the rest, but we get this error on most if not all users.
 ​
 Thanks!!

In our production environment, though, we have a particular network which is HW firewalled except for some web addresses, so in that context Winget is not able to communicate externally. At the moment it seems to me there's no proxy support in Winget, so I was wondering if there's a simple solution on how to allow winget to operate also on that limited network.

 What will exactly happen to these Apple ID's?
 Since the Apple ID's that they are currently using are all created with their company emails. Will the only real change be that the accounts are changed from a personal ID to a company ID?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins, I need to run a sanity check hope you can shed some light.
 I've inherited an environment, I'm still discovering and learning about it. It's an on-prem bare-metal/VMware, public cloud is minimal and completely independant. One concern that I have is that I'm seen some odd DHCP reservations for productions servers.
 To give an idea, I've seen DHCP reservation for MS-SQL database server, Domain controllers (all of them), Application Servers, anything that seems to be a production server where many people connect to, it is likely to have a reservation.
 Then in some cases, not all of them, the server has a static IP address assigned, despite of having a reservation. And you probably guess it, the IP address statically assigned to that server is in the DHCP range where other Desktop computers are also connected. This causes that the DHCP report the reservation as inactive.
 From the other side of the fence the monitoring system which is simple doing ICMP every once in awhile detects that host is down. There are no connectivity problems in some occasions when I manually check.
 In some other instances the ESXi web UI is inaccessible, I've experienced myself a duplicate IP caused by one of my computers that took the exact reserved IP address which belongs to that ESXi.
 My question is simple. Is this a normal practice to heavily rely on DHCP reservations to manage mission critical servers IP addressing? My personal bias to decimate that configuration. Go back to traditional static IP addressing, pushing the DHCP range to leave room for server addressing.
 On what scenarios a DHCP reservation would make sense to keep when dealing with servers that run network services that should be available to employees.

But I was wondering if I can update my OS without moving any data.
 I want to create a bootable partition in RAID 1 across x2 NVMe or SSD drives for the OS and have all my data on x4 High Capacity 7200RPM drives in a RAID 10 btrfs partition. That way, in theory, I can install a new OS, log in and have all my data still there on the other partition. Is this right/possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, hoping to get some pointers on a planned SharePoint migration. Mainly around Teams setup as each site will likely be Teams enabled.
 I understand there are varying degrees of complexity depending on depth of Teams integration but have narrowed it down to 3 options.
  
Setup each department with their own site and dump folders alongside General. No private channels at this stage but, if setup down the line, there'll be nothing in General for users who are added (I understand the new Shared Channel option fixes this but seems fine to just keep everything alongside General anyway. Users can't delete the General folder but can delete the contents).
 Setup one site and create Private channels for the various departments. Easier to manage from a permissions standpoint as we can delegate channel owners to add and remove members. Downside is limit on number of private channels per team (will probably be under that though). I can map private channels to File Explorer but the name doubles-up (can fix this by customising the desktop.ini file).
 Let SharePoint migration tool dump everything to one site and call it a day. Deal with permission changes as needed.
  
Also keen on references to other guides or scripts for checking file conflicts outside of the SharePoint migration tool. Been trying to research best practices for a while but the info keeps changing since the platform keeps evolving. Also saw a guide about using metadata rather than folders so they're accessible from more than one location but that seems like even more work/complexity.
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a particular client who are of Chinese background and still do a lot of business with China, so they have been using WeChat to communicate with external users. I don't like it, but it is what it is.
 What I have done in this case is install the WeChat UWP app from the Microsoft Store to at least limit it's access because UWP Microsoft Store apps are supposed to be Sandboxed.
 What has now happened is that the UWP app has been pulled from the Microsoft Store and the only one in there now is one which requires "Uses all system resources" and then prompts for Admin rights upon install just for good measure.
 I tried to outsmart them by using the wechat web app https://web.wechat.com/ and this worked for a while too. But now what happens is that when the user scans the code it then takes them a page which says that they need to install the Desktop app instead.
 This has been a blessing because now I have the justification to completely remove it from the computer and have it stay on their personal phones, under the threat of hijacking the entire computer.
 I just wanted to give others the heads up of what's going on.
 And also, to call out Microsoft for even allowing such malicious activity to occur in the Windows Store, when the original intent was to have every app Sandboxed except by special permission of having the app verified by them, which obviously they have not done by allowing an app like this to have full permissions and request admin rights to the whole system.

 I have an R740 Dell PowerEdge server with dual port 10GB Broadcom NetExtreme SFP+ Ethernet network daughter card where I've plugged in a SFP+ single mode fiber 10GB LR transceiver, brand name 10gtek part# ‎AXS13-192-10-Cisco2. I have connected a single mode fiber optic cable there and the other end on a quantum scalar library tape drive 8GB fibre channel connection(no transceiver needed there) but i see no link light status on R740's NIC. I performed a loopback test on the dual R740 SFP+ ports by connecting them to each other with same type transceivers of course and got green link lights. I'm not sure what to make of all this or where the incompatibility lies between all new equipment and accessories. The OS is Windows Svr 2019 and has all and the latest drivers. I'm certain the system doesn't have a fiber channel HBA as it utilizing the NDC card described. One of the SFP+ NIC port on the same card has an cat 7 ethernet cable connected also by transceiver and has no issues, status lights are green. I've tried swapping the ports I'm connecting the fiber but no luck. I'm very new with this type of networking and hoping someone more experienced can point out the obvious. Dell support says their hardware has no issues based on logs.
 I see someone here with a similar issue but their solution hasn't worked for me. https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/R740-Fiber-Module-issue/td-p/6089505

 So for the past few months I have finally constructed my homelab to a point where I would consider it "stable" but "rolling release" esque. It works, but I keep doing minor adjustments to it as new versions come out and as I fine-tune settings. But, it does what I need it to. And now I want to preserve that - and I want to do that real good.
 First, a bit about my setup:
  
Desktop and Laptop with Windows 10
 Mini Server (FriendlyElec NanoPi R6s) with OpenWrt 22 + Docker containers
 Two remote servers (small VPSes) with Debian 11 each
 Synology NAS DS413j
 I have a Wasabi subscription
  
My plan is to set up a backup repository on my NAS and then send that into my Wasabi storage as an off-site solution with the encryption keys stored separately as a copy in Proton Drive…]]></summary>

Anyway, I've been looking for an hour and (you know how this goes) for whatever reason i can't find that perfectly google'd article showing me exactly how to do it.
 anyway, i have a 365 tenant with 2 separate companies (formerly one company, big expansion, still friendly) and company B needs to set up a team with their own domain on the email address. i need to allow teams to be created with a choice of email domains - either Company A dot com or Company B dot com.
 is this a powershell email address policy issue or is there an easier way to do it? I am all about easy.
 Thanks in advance to you young whippersnappers with good eyes. I used to make fun of guys like me. They were usually big Novell proponents!

 We use them as a primary router that we sell as part of our WAN service offering, and the only real requirements we have are that it needs to support up to a 1gbps connection, support LTE and vDSL.
 We've been eyeing off the Cisco 900 series, but we're open to other options as we're quite flexible with what we go with.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on other models we could go with?

 I've been in the field for ~15 years now going through customers, VAR, and vendor life. I'm very well compensated and generally don't hate work.
 However, I'm very close to becoming Financially Independent (FI) /r/financialindependence/. I don't really feel like stopping work, but I'd sure love to not work full time. For someone who is CCIE level of skill what type of part-time opportunities might there be?
 I'm open to true PT or maybe working FT 6 months a year, maybe doing a contract part of the year then not working the other half. I was debating trying to reach out to some recruiters in my network to see if they get those types of opportunities'. I also considered teaching, but honestly it doesn't excite me a ton.
 Whatever I do I'd like to be able to take large chunks of time off to travel (2-3 months a year) and some decent PTO otherwise to enjoy time with my family.
 What options might you suggest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to setup LLDP on my Cisco 9300 switches to allow my Poly phones to determine their location for E911 on Zoom. I have only used CDP, and with the voice vlan, the phones figure out what vlan they need to be, and life's great. But, when I try to dial 933 to verify the more granular E911 location, it can't seem to sort out the MAC address of the switch it's connected to so it can be more precise.
 So far, I ran lldp run on the switch, and it seems to now be on. If I run show lldp neighbors, I get all the phones, APs, and other junk on the switch. But, the phone still doesn't seem to know what's going on. Running LDWin on a client machine to read the LLDP packets doesn't yield any results either. Either I'm getting erroneous results, or LLDP isn't configured correctly.
 Looking at the Cisco documentation, it looks like I may need to run lldp transmit and lldp receive on the specific interfaces, but that hasn't gotten me anywhere either. Oddly enough, the commands do not error out, but if I show the running config for the interface, those commands don't show up in the config. At the bottom of the post is the current interface config.
 I'm certain I'm missing something simple and obvious, but this is kicking my butt.
 Port config:

 The authentication popup from most of the O365 powershell modules - even the latest ExchangeOnline Powershell 3.0 - is actually rendered by internet explorer (Microsoft is an exception to their own forced deprecation), not edge, and cannot do FIDO2 keys.
 So, a password and MS Authenticator or another legacy MFA method that isn't hardware secured, needs to be an option for Administrators, the ones who really need the most security and should be using FIDO2. All because Microsoft is an exception to one of their own rules that they have assured the rest of the industry no one really needs exceptions to because re-developing for Edge is so easy and long overdue.
 Hypocrisy at its finest.

 I‘ve recently started a new role and looking to lock a few things down. I’m just looking at an ACL for locking down vty access. 
 Are there any best practices for denying SSH from PC vlans? We have roughly 30 switches … previous places we have had an ACL on each individual switch. But have been playing with applying an ACL at the SVI on the L3 instead. 
 Couldn‘t find Much on guidelines or whether its personal preference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for someone who has access to a stock Nexcom NSA 5130 appliance and would be willing to provide me a dump of its BIOS. It‘s a fairly standard x86 type device with an AMI Aptio 4 BIOS that can be dumped with AMI‘s regular tools. I would be able to provide a FreeDOS image with the necessary tool included, so it would be a matter of writing this to a USB thumbdrive, booting it and running a single command.
 Background is that I obtained a Barracuda F400 firewall appliance that is based on the Nexcom but has a custom BIOS, lacking some features, most importantly the acoustic management part.

 QNAP’s advisory on Monday said that network-attached storage devices running QTS versions before 5.0.1.2234 and QuTS Hero versions prior to h5.0.1.2248 were vulnerable. 
 If exploited, this vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious code.
 Of course your QNAP probably shouldnt be web accessible... but according to some articles at least 29,000 are. No public POC or Exploit yet but it will come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might not exactly be a /r/sysadmin topic, but I imagine A/V rolls up to a lot of you at SMBs, so I figure this is probably the community with the highest # of folks that have direct experience supporting end users / corporate A/V.
 I'm looking for a universal solution that allows for wireless screen sharing (i.e. presenting from a device to a large display in a conference room).
 To date, we've been using ClickShare since that seemed to be the most device agnostic solution, but now that a lot of newer computers (especially MacBooks) have completely gotten rid of USB type A connectors, we're finding it less suitable than it used to be. And, hard as it is to believe, we've actually had a non-zero instance of people leaving with the ClickShare buttons!
 MiraCast is a decent solution for Windows devices, but my understanding is MiraCast is completely unsupported on Macs.
 It seems like there are relatively simple solutions that can be made to work with certain types of devices (i.e. an AppleTV is simple for Macs), but finding a universal solution that works with Win/Mac (and ideally iOS/Android too) seems to be a challenge.
 In a perfect world, it seems like there ought to be some sort of lightweight software agent that doesn't require any client-side hardware (or admin privileges) and would work across all these device types. I.E. - post a URL in the meeting room - visitors go there to download the agent, which automagically connects them to the A/V system in the room. Does such a thing exist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I inherited this nightmare, it isn’t my creation. I’m just tasked with making this whole thing work and so far I’m at an almost complete loss on the best way to segment this mess. It’s a fairly large subnet class c /21 with everything (and I do mean everything) on a single network. One of the biggest hurdles that I’ve had is diagnosing where the current loops are due to the Unifi system meshing (if meshing is turned off, nothing works which tells me it wasn’t designed correctly to begin with). So I’m trying to come up with a new design that will use what I’ve been given (they went building to building instead of each building back to the core due to the costs for horizontal boring). I’ve got two actual routers (Cisco) and some newer Catalyst 9200’s which are capable of full L3 routing (full meaning they can use an actual routing protocol and not just static). 
 My first thought is to segment out each building with it’s own network and VLAN but I am at a loss on making it so everything can still get to everything (this is a live production/manufacturing facility so they cannot go down).The only way to really isolate the loops that remain (this network grew at rapid speed over about 20 years - things just kept being added on and not properly tracked) is to attempt to use the Catalyst devices as “border routers”. I’ve been working in this field for over 20 years and I can honestly say, this is the first network that hasn’t been a standard full mesh or hub and spoke design. So I’m reaching out to the wise folks on here to see if I’m going about this the right way or if perhaps someone out there has experience with such a thing and can give me some pointers. I’ve been removing every hub/non managed switch I can find as I come across them because they seem to quite literally be everywhere lol along with documenting how everything actually connects for future reference.

That being said, a few duties of my job include, maintaining the corporate network, maintaining our cyber risk standards (updates, anti-virus, MFA, etcetc), and Helpdesk for other employees.
 What's interesting is that over the year, I've been introduced into a few of the other random things IT 'takes care' of.
 We have 2 restaurants in the building that both use an outdated POS system. The guy who maintained the backend left a few months back, so now I'm in control of adding food buttons, prices, taxes and making sure the numbers match in the reports. (That should be a finance dept. thing)
 I'm being trained in SQL, so that I can be a backup once our programmer leaves. But I really don't care for programming. We're looking into Interns/hiring so I don't understand why we just find someone who likes SQL.
 I also have to setup most of the meetings for the execs; Which I'm not really surprised about. Just annoying as it takes me away from what I was working on especially on their 'meeting days'.
 And, I've been making the graphics for a few displays in our employee break rooms that include whatever deals we currently have for employees, position postings, inspirational posts. We have a marketing\graphics team, but I think they don't even know about them.
 This seems to be a thing that happens in all departments though. My friend in Marketing gets the 'privilege' of driving the co-owner home when he has a fun night at the bar. Keep in mind the drive is 45 mins there and 45 back. And our AV guy has to change the movie that plays on loop in the co-owner's office whenever he calls.
 Overall it's a interesting place to work. Anyone else have some whacky side duties you got stuck with?

 What they want is instead have the customer plug into a switchport and then have the MPLS run on a router SVI from end to end, Router on a Stick style. They want it to be L2, so the CE equipment just sees us as a LAN. And they don't want to monkey with the client's VLAN tags...what goes in tagged on one side comes out tagged on the other.

 I've tried having the switchport as a trunk and just allow the VLAN associated with the SVI on the router. I've tried it as an all-in trunk. I've tried it as an access port. The CE equipment doesn't see each other.
 Am I missing something, or is this not possible? All of our gear is old and not getting any newer...the routers I'm using are 3800's, the switches aren't L3. Here's the port configs I'm using....
 Router 1:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/1.2050 description CE1 for VC2050
 encapsulation dot1Q 2050
 xconnect 10.30.30.254 2050 encapsulation mpls
 ;
 interface Loopback100
 ip address 10.30.10.254 255.255.255.255
 Switch 1:
 description CE1
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 2050
 switchport mode trunk
 Router 3:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0.2050
 description CE2 for VC2050
 encapsulation dot1Q 2050
 xconnect 10.30.10.254 2050 encapsulation mpls
 ;
 interface Loopback100
 ip address 10.30.30.254 255.255.255.255
 Switch 2:
 interface FastEthernet0/24
 description Uplink to CE2
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 2050
 switchport mode trunk

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have very basic security at our company of 50-75 employees as it has never been prioritized.
 During the past few months we made our first baby steps by deploying:
 - 2FA for domain admins (yes, I don't know why this was never a thing, but it tells a story)
 - On-premise password manager
 - Bitlocker
 - Changed some password of domain accounts that hadn't been changed in years
 ​
 This is all great, but it's not much. The management is quite strict about what security measure can be deploye, as it must not be too annoying for employees.
 What are the next steps to take? Annoying or not.

 We're migrating from SCEP to Defender for Endpoint and I'd like some confirmation/guidance on my plan.
 We're fully on-prem and utilize SCCM/MECM with the built in SCEP - no Azure or Intune - yet. 
 Correct me if I'm wrong, but in order to deploy Defender for Endpoint, we will need to enable Co-management in SCCM in order to get the devices into Intune, and then onboard the devices into Endpoint via SCCM? 
 Thanks for any suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Per the subject, I've been dipping my toes into Autopilot and when it works, it's great.
 We enrolled 10+ devices and they worked exactly how we wanted but we've been aiming to further streamline things so I've been tested by resetting my spare laptop.
 Unfortunately I've just started running into issues where my spare laptop and another (which just needed to be reset) that have successfully Autopilot in the past (and have had no hardware changes) have suddenly started failing to Autopilot and instead continue with the standard Windows setup.
 During the Autopilot process CTRL+SHIFT+D simply shows "User-based Azure AD Join - required error event data incomplete or missing"
 If I check the Event Log I can see
 "Event ID 704 - Autopilot downloader retrieved an empty profile for DdzZtdPolicyManager" where on devices it's been successful in the past we can see "Autopilot downloader retrieved a new profile for DdsZtdPolicyManager."
 Unfortunately I've not been able to find anything useful for diagnosing why we'd get an empty profile. I've tried completely removing the device from Autopilot and AzureAD and then using Get-WindowsAutopilotinfo -Online from OOBE to push the serial and hash again but I continue to experience the same problem. The devices are still present in InTune and have profiled assigned.
 Just wondered if anyone had any pointers for diagnosing why we'd retrieve an empty profile before I bang my head on a wall with Microsoft?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I've been using both pfSense and Synology's OpenVPN server options. Both work great but there is an issue on the pfSense server: when I access with a device through the VPN, it cannot ping or see Windows machines, unless I disable the firewall. But when I use Synology's OpenVPN, I don't need to disable the firewall. I suppose there's a solution that can be applied on the pfSense side, without having to mess around with Windows Firewall rules, but I don't know what should I do because I don't even know why these Windows machines are blocking that traffic.
 My pfSense is currently set in this way:
 - 1 port for WAN.
 - 3 extra ports for LAN that are bridged to work like a hub/switch. This bridge is the DHCP server.
 - Firewall rules to allow traffic between the ports on the pfsense mini-pc to the rest of the network. 
 Everything works just fine but when it comes to openVPN, I have the firewall issue with Windows.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks for the help! 🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are having an issue with one of our EMR apps that connects via RDWeb. We experience intermittent connection issues between the hours of 8-10 AM in the beginning of the month or end of the month.
 I have been banging my head on the desk for months trying to figure out why this is the case.
 We have a app company that manages the app and we have an app consultant on site for a few days a week to help with any issues. I have checked the computer resources and nothing (CPU, Ethernet Task Manager tasks) even spikes when it runs or trying to connect.
 I've run wireshark scans both inside and outside the network. Outside the network it appears to connect via UDP while inside the network it appears to connect via HTTP. Outside the network there is never any problems and the loading takes much quicker.
 Issues I have encountered are slow typing within the app, having to end the RDS sessions and then connect the users again (sometimes this even chokes at first time login), and of course users not being able to login at all. This also happens on completely random computers throughout the month and NEVER at the same time. 
 They can hit the RDWeb url just fine and download the RDP app just fine, and we can use all other websites/apps just fine. It's just getting in and STAYING in that is an issue.
 I'm thinking there has to be a feature that prioritizes who or how many people can continuously connect to this app at the same time or something on the network.
 I'm also thinking that it has to do with the fact that we HAVE to use HTTP instead of UDP.
 Is there anything else we can try to stabilize the connection? Would looking into some event logs on the PCs help?

 Main concern is that I'll be "let go" or terminated since my company can terminate "at will" meaning they could probably easily terminate me from this contract once I tell them about my wishes to pursue another career. Supervisor and I are on great terms but are at no means close or friends. 
 To anyone with experience in this situation, how would you notify your supervisor of this new job you want to apply for and explain that if you don't get accepted, you would still be happy to keep working in the current position?

 I find snap being super annoying and less convient to automate around than my trusty old APT. 
 I mean it's faster to type AND EXECUTE apt update && apt install -y python3-certbot than to first install snap, and then install certbot. What's the benefit of snap?!

 1 - interface loo500
 2 - clear configuration this
 3 - yes
 ​
 I'm using netmiko for the time being while i try to learn more about ansible playbook. I need to figure this out because i'm going to use this tools to implement several BGP peers accros multiple devices, and to apply the route-policy into the IPv6 peer i need to respond with yes. Does someone know how to handle this?
 ​
 I tried to use the netmiko prompt but it only allows me to insert one command (i need to be inside the interface). I also tried to but one service to enter the interface and use workflow to clear the configuration on the next command, but when it runs it is made a new connection with de device (my thought was that in the workflow, when a service ends and a new one begins, the new one would take place where the first one ended).

 I am involved in migrating on-prem infrastructure to 365/Azure etc for many SMB's, but I just cannot get Sharepoint online working reliably. It seems to work fine for smaller sites, but the larger the customer, the more problems they have with it.
 I am migrating on prem shares into Sharepoint - giving each share its own site. I then either deploy the share via Intune so that it appears in the Explorer sidebar, or simply have the customer "add shortcut to OneDrive" 
 The thing is, I'm constantly having OneDrive sync issues. Either it gets stuck syncing, doesn't sync everything, gives errors when downloading cloud files through explorer etc, and it's overall a very poor experience for the customer. 
 Doing things via the web browser is fine, but doesn't offer the old school functionality of accessing files via explorer.
 What am I doing wrong? It's driving me up the wall! The amount of times I've had to reinstall OneDrive/resync data is absurd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Totally at a loss here, so wondering if anyone else has come across this.
 The firm likes to send out a monthly newsletter (amongst other things), and to do this, they use Mailchimp. This is fine, I've created the relevant DNS records and such, and all is well. However, the way Mailchimp links images rather than embeds means that Outlook doesn't display images by default. The only way around this, that I'm aware off, is to set the sender in Safe (Trusted) Senders and Domains for all users
 I've done this via a PowerShell script:
 ``` Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName user@example.com 
 $users = Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox 
 foreach ($user in $users) {
 Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration "$($user.UserPrincipalName)" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add="mail.example.com"} }
 ```
 I have also try to only do one user, eg. Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration "user@example.com" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add="mail.example.com"}
 Either way I do this though, the change shows up when I look at junk settings in OWA or Outlook 365 desktop, but within 10 minutes, it's no longer in there, almost as if the change has been undone
 If I manually add the domain to my safe senders list, it remains there absolutely fine, so I don't believe this is some rogue setting or script that's clearing out the safe senders list

 That is not a problem, but I don't know how to extract that output to PDF, CSV or some other format. 
 Only thing that I found was in notification options that send me when mass push config is done, and on what devices was successful and on what wasn't.

 I'm having some intermittend network issues with a client that doesn't show anything related in network device logs, so probably client related.
 In the past I troubleshooted those issues with a kinda throwing star looking physical tap device and a laptop. But is there a hardware PCAP device that someone could recommend that is easily attaced to a port mirror on a switch that captures all the traffic, saves it as a PCAP for troubleshooting using Wireshark and possibly even have a web interface of some sort to download the PCAP files from?
 I'm unable to find a good tool online.
 That would really makes this process a lot easier because we'd be able to ship this thing to a client preconfigured and they just need to hook it up to a switch.
 Thanks!

 I'm looking to do the MS Azure Administrator Course during my free time off work.I have setup a basic on premise Windows Server 2022 for the labs that require on-prem activities.
 The question is more on the Azure licenses required to "fully" go through learning lab scenarios.
 I have registered for a free Azure account and gone through a few initial basic labs scenarios. But as i move on to further lab scenarios, i realise there are many options not available to me.
 I have seen that there is this "Pay As You Go" subscription and also subscriptions such as "Basic (Which is the free), Developer, Standard" and as well as others such as "P1, P2, etc"
 As this is for self learning lab scenarios, I would just need the functions there. There wont be 1000 users using the full MS Azure suite. There will only be 1 admin and 1 test user for the scenarios.
 Can someone anyone who knows or have gone through the same situation as me advise what is the most "basic" subscription to be able to at least have most of the functions to complete the AZ104 course/labs scenarios.
 Thanks in advance!!

 Questions to those who used Azure Virtual Desktop in their environment. I am new to Azure Virtual Desktop, and have a few questions that I am hoping some of you kind people might enlighten me on.
 (1) If we already have some Azure presence, like existing vNet, can we integrate it with AVD?
 (2) If we can't integrate it with our vNet, what are other options (like using client VPN, things like that)?
 (3) From the cost perspective what are the options if we have general users and more power users What is a better way to organize those?
 Thank you!

 i need some help on our rds hosts. Some specifiations:
 We have 6 RDS (Server 2019) and one Broker for about 220 user. All RDS have 16 Cores and 64 GB Ram and sitting on a full flash SAN. No GPU. All virtualized on Hyper-V 2019.
 Sometimes user reporting that the server feels slow. If i go to the user and look at his problem i can confirm this problem. The monitoring of the host itself seems okay. CPU wise we are about 20 % with some peaks, but very rarely over 80 %. RAM wise also about 60 %. Disk i/o and network are not real latency. 
 The problems for the users are mostly slow responding applications (not crashing) while moving the windows, latency on typing in different applications, and some other stuff. 
 For a small test i removed our anti virus (Sophos) but that does not help.
 If i read some old threads here on reddit most other people have much more user per server without issues. So it does not seem an issue on the user/server ratio.
 ATM i'm thinking about buying a hardware server with an GPU to test it. Hyper-V does not really support GPU partitioning or passthrough. We tried RemoteFX last year, but that does not really work.
 So maybe some of you have some input where i can solve my performance issue on these server.
 Thanks.

 I have tried the following;
 Repaired Office
 Installed Latest updates
 Rebuilt .OSD

 Disabled all add-ons and added each one back one by one.
 Any ideas?

 The reason is I am using leaf switches between spine and core, and in the event of a spine failure I need the end client in the leaf to have its port disabled.
 For redundancy purposes. So let's say if one port would fail, I would need the other port to fail too.
 I am not sure if this is possible to program or there is this protocol.
 Switches are Catalyst 9300 and CBS350 X

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody,
 Brief context: We have(had) 2 DCs, but one got corrupted during a server migration (things seemed fine for a good while, I was sleeping post-surgery but my director and team member didn’t want to wait until the next Friday, also didn’t follow my migration procedure but it’s fine) and we ended up seeing SID errors in the AD resulting in newer user accounts being auto-deleted, etc etc.
 Troubleshooting went nowhere.
 Solution was: shut off DC2 and see if DC1 has issues by itself. It didn’t. Awesome.
 Now: DC1 is online, DC2 is offline but never demoted (and VM has no NIC config), DC02 (new VM) is a trigger pull away from backing up DC1.
 Questions: 1) If I add DC02 as a DC to the domain using “any dc” as a replication source, can I change this later? (Because I might like to make this “only DC1,” temporarily, which brings us to… 2) I want to bring DC2 online to properly demote it, but how can I ensure it won’t torpedo DC1 with bad/redundant records as soon as they reunite? Can I just (while DC2 still has no network config) set their sync relationship to be 1-way, give it network access again, demote it, shut it down for good? 3) Depending on 2)’s answer, should DC02 be held offline and not joined to the domain until DC2 is gone for good? Or is it safer to add it, test it, then shut it down while sorting DC1&2 so that, if they implode, I can just shut them down and bring up DC02?

 I cannot for the life of me find free software that will allow me to use the merge partition open within windows server, i have Aoemi for my home pc which works wonders but that version dont work on server, every free product ive tried seems to be restricted in the way that merge is not covered under free features, or requires a server version of the software which locks that feature out.

 Any suggestions on one that will allow me to do it so i dont need to get the company to buy something

I rebooted it once and it worked properly, there was no message.

 Should i continue and configure this controller oand just ignore the message?

 Left scratching my head to fix it. I've tried Windows drivers, Lenovo drivers, Lenovo system centre software to handle drivers.
 Can't pin point the cause... Appears to happen mostly on windows resume from laptop lid beong opened, but some are saying it happens while working.
 Pretty much every device is affected. School environment so people are spitting chips about restarting multiple times a day.

 Everyone on here seems stressed, overworked, and underpaid. I have a friend back at home starting his first full time firefighting paramedic job that tops out around $100k. Not to mention he’s keeping his part time gig so he’s going to be raking in around $130k-$140k a year. Also, as if that wasn’t good enough, he’s always able to play video games with me on his PS5 at the station while he’s not running a call.
 Am I getting into the wrong profession? I love technology and fixing things, but if I can get paid more to do a job that provides a better work life balance, I might have to consider doing that.
 Does anyone here enjoy their job? Is everyone here underpaid? Is this career just an endless pit of stress and boredom?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started running into an issue a few weeks ago where my domains' SSL wasn't being automatically renewed any more, and my certs started to expire, even though dehydrated was running daily as it should.
 It was running daily, but it was stuck: the process was still showing in ps the next day. Dehydrated and its helpers are all bash scripts, so I was able to throw set -o xtrace at the top to see what bash was running, and this was the offending block:
 cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` while ! valid_ip $cliip; do sleep 2 cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` done 
 This is a block of code in the Dehydrated helper script for Namecheap, that detects the running machine's IP. Except if the call fails, it gets stuck forever sleeping every 2 seconds and trying again. And as it turns out, the v4 and v6 subdomains to ifconfig.co were deprecated in 2018 and finally removed in January sometime.
 So the upshot is that v4.ifconfig.co/ip should be changed to ifconfig.co and your Dehydrated/Namecheap setup will come back to life.
 Also, set -o xtrace is a lifesaver for debugging Bash scripts that are getting stuck.

 No sub-netting has been done (it was setup that from the beginning) and there are over 500 devices (User PCs and servers) Connected using L2+ switches (Cisco and D-Link).
 Frequently we find "LDB Loop detected" error message logged in our network switches even when there are no actual (physical) loop in our network and this message is logged in some switches and at random times. 
 After Auto error recovery timeout exceeds the set value of 60 seconds the port gets re-enabled and switches function normally without showing any loopback messages. During this entire time of event “No physical changes” were done to the network.
 I have checked all the switch logs and tried to find any physical loops in our network , but found none.
 I did a Google search to check if "large numbers of IP’s or devices can cause Loopback error " but could not find any posts regarding the same incident. One of the posts that I had gone through indicated that "large numbers of IP’s or devices" might not cause Loopback problem.
 My experience in Networking is limited. Any veterans could confirm if, 
  
Can Loopback error occur commonly if there are large numbers of devices in a subnet?
 Just wondering whether having a large single subnet (net mask 255.255.248.0) with 2000+ assignable IP addresses but with just 100 devices also causes Loopback error.
  
Any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been banging my dead about this all evening. I have Metalogix Archive Manager and I need to move to a new file server. Archive manager takes the original file, moves it to cheaper storage, then leave a stub in its place. 
 I need to move the stubs without recalling the original file, but every method I have tried with Robocopy won't just copy the stub. I can't recall all the files to move them because I don't have enough room on my Pure SAN. I have also tried stopping the Archive manager services, but robocopy just throws access errors and copies over a 0k corrupted file.
 Is there a way to do this with Robocopy or better method?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of migrating 100TB share to our new storage (Isilon A200). The LUNS are currently configured as one big LUN inside of VMware as 1 DS. I'd like to break this up to reduce data loss in the event we have failures and also to simplify our backups (VEEAM).
 Looking for advice on how I should separate this at the SAN level / VMware / Microsoft level ?
 My initial thoughts are:
  
10 x 10 TB LUNS
 10 x 10 TB DataStores VMF6 (I don't think vvols add any value but maybe I'm wrong ?) 
 Leverage Storage Spaces on Wiindows to consolidate the disks into one virtual disk ?
 Separate the data into separate basic disks and use DFS-N to present the share as a unified share ?
 
  
I have no experience with Storage Spaces but am quite familiar with LVM on linux so shouldn't be an issue. DFS I have a good handle on.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do networking in my day job, but I've been casually looking around at other infrastructure roles that are out there and a lot of them want CI/CD and Kubernetes. 
 Please correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is the having a CI/CD pipeline is primarily for if you have some kind of application that you're hosting and constantly developing. (And K8 is for managing all the docker containers running those applications). 
 Maybe I'm looking at this wrong, but I don't see how any of that interacts with a role where the primary task is maintaining and building a network. (And thus the dilemma (when it comes to applying for other roles) that I've never interacted with any of these things outside of youtube videos and playing around with small scale versions in my home lab) 
 I get the idea of treating your network configs as code and keeping them in some kind of VCS like git, but does anyone actually have a CI/CD pipeline for pushing networking config changes? How would you even write tests for something like that, that you could then put in some kind of automated pipeline?

Trying to convince my boss to abandon Cisco because I’m sick of them, so he wants to put together a list of alternatives. 
 After talking to our VAR and doing a lot of research, it seems like the top choices would be: Mist, Aruba, or Arista. Personally I’m leaning towards Mist, but curious to see what everyone else thinks. I like their management software and if they can actually reduce support tickets anywhere in the realm of what their salesperson claims it would be a huge benefit. 
 Any mist users out there? Or anyone who thinks Aruba/Cisco/Arista is a better option?
 Edit: to clarify, campus is how we refer to our corporate head quarters (mid-sized company with ~1k employees at HQ). We are not an actual college campus.

 We were cabling a server the other day and one link (10Gb fiber) just wouldn't come up on the designated port. We moved it to another port to test and still no light. However, it seems the test port was probably shutdown; as was the port we were trying originally. There was a mistake in the cabling documentation so they were plugging into the wrong ports.
 So I should just be able to fix the documentation and send the guys back out to cable it right? But I thought a port would still show some type of link lights if it was shutdown, which makes me think there's still something else broken if true.
 We did test the fiber cable, NIC, and GBIC on a known-working port and it all worked.
 I don't have physical access to this equipment to check for myself.

 But we have these CBORD devices that handle Student Payments (at Soda Machines, et al) and Card Swipy devices for CheckIn type things. When plugged into the Catalyst they work just fine. No PoE needed and they pull their reserved IP no problem. Can see it on the Catalyst CLI, can Ping it, everything is great. 
 Swap that plug to a Meraki switch and the port DOESN'T EVEN ACTIVATE. No link lights, nothing. As far as Meraki is telling me there is no device plugged into that port. I've tried multiple ports on multiple switches now - same issue. Works on Catalyst just fine, Meraki doesn't want anything to do with it. The VLAN in use is one of the most widely used VLANs but I still went up and down the line to verify connectivity. 
 Has anyone ever encountered anything like this?

 I hope some of you great people might be able to help. I’m conducting an experiment for my studies where I am measuring routing protocol convergence performance in a simulated and real hardware environment. 
 I am struggling to make sense of how to calculate the convergence itself. Do I ping the host on the other end of the network continuously, and then shutdown an interface and time a change or do I simulate a data packet through Cisco simulation during which I shutdown the port to see how the routing protocol reacts?
 For my simulated part I am using the CPT simulator. For my real hardware I plan on using a Wireshark. Has anyone any idea how to measure the convergence times? I have browsed through the net but not to luck so far. 
 Your help is greatly appreciated!

 Have you worked for a company that's implemented it? Have you had to implement it yourself because management has told you to? How do you feel about it? What do you make of the potential for abuse?
 My opinion is simply: no. But, would love to hear what you guys think. And yes, there are regulations to deter it that are looking to be enforced more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone know if controllers (particularly, 1832 Mobility Express virtual controllers) rate-limit or shape traffic per client when the client load is high and if so, where can I turn that off at? I have a site that typically has 80 users connected to the wireless at any given time. Daily total bytes pushed through the wireless is 1.4 terabytes (you read that right). As such, when I look at the speeds my clients are pushing, most are in the Kbps range, and some are in the low Mbps range (2-5Mbps per client). The site only has a 100Mbps pipe.
 Logically speaking, I have to imagine if my users are pushing 1.4TB through the wireless in 24 hours (site is 24/7), and the WAN pipe is 100Mbps, then the Mobility Express controller instance has to be rate-limiting the connections somewhere, independent of the maximum amount of bandwidth allowed per client slider under RF Optimization in expert view.
 Does anyone know, and if so, can you direct me to where I can tweak that? I'm getting slowness complaints from the site, but with 80 people using the wifi at that level of data, you kinda have to expect that no?

 The issue: password managers allow you to store things like TOTP (time-based) tokens in them. This is very convenient since you don't need to dig up a phone to log in, it can be auto-filled, and easily backed up. However, this is significantly degrading the security of having the second factor in the first place.
 Why it matters: multi-factor authentication is predicated on distributing security into multiple areas, so an account compromise requires significantly more effort. Typically, factors are "something you know" (e.g. a password), "something you have" (e.g. a phone or hardware token), and "something you are" (e.g. a fingerprint or other biometrics).

 I'm working on a moving project, we've rented a rack in a DC and want to move our whole infra there and I'd like to get rid of our tape library... I know they are immutable and great but I hate them and being the only guy that has to remember to buy, replace, store, and tag all the tapes is starting to suck.
 I've eyed this HPE storeOnce solution, we use Veeam for our backups, and the hypervisor is hyper-v (corporate decision) backups are running ok with a 3-2-1 approach, but as I said, being storeOnce with Catalyst kinda immutable I wanted to get feedback about this in order to hopefully switch to that instead of tapes. 
 My main questions are:
 - is the deduplication that good? I've read about a 20:1 ratio (for storage planning)
 - has the catalyst technology ever created issues in your environment? Have you replaced other immutable backup means like tapes with that? 
 Thank you!

 I know this sounds stupid, but we are about to undergo our first internal pen test and I'm scared lol
 I am the sole admin for a SMB and wear all the hats. We've grown quite a bit over the last couple of years and are now up to a little over 150 people in our org. I totally understand ultimately this is a good thing to do, but I'm worried as soon as I plug in the box they are sending us we'll get pwned super easily and I'm going to look like an idiot in front of my boss and management. Stupid I know.
 Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had any advice on things to double check that we definitely want to make sure we have locked down before we start. I've been making a list and a lot of this stuff I had already implemented a while ago, but it was good to confi…]]></summary>

 We share two servers with a single user account among ourself for work. So having a way to figure out if someone else already has a active session to a machine will be great.
 I already tried using "qwinsta /server:serverIP" and "query session /server:serverIP". But both of these just return "No session exists for *". I tried googling more but haven't found anything solid. Also tried using "psloggedon \serverIP", this returns a list of users which includes the one we all use commonly. But every user has <unknown time>. This doesn't change even if I am connected to the machine or not. So not much of an help. If you guys know how to fix this or a workaround, it would be great.

 I work for a number of clients where we have used App-V as the primary packaging toolset for both traditional desktops and virtual clients hosted on tools such as Citrix and VMware. 
 With the support for App-V now gone and Microsoft's push towards MSIX I wondered what people's thoughts and experience around this is. 
 I did work on a client where we started using MSIX initially but found the feature set compared to App-V to be limited with an anticpitation that this would improve over time. 
 I've read the MSIX report cards that Tim Mangan does and see that the success ratio without additional tools such as PSF has a hit rate of 31% for MSIX compared to 90% for App-V.
 We are approaching a junction point in our application management stack and thinking of dropping Application Virtualisation in favour of using toolsets such as Winget and / or PSADT to wrap vendors installers. 
 Let me know what your thoughts are on this.
 Thanks.

 Basically I bought a machine for my home lab - Dell PowerEdge T40, with 16GB of RAM.
 I installed Win22 server on it, installed Hyper-V and a DC in that Hyper-V with 8GB of RAM.
 I wanted to create Windows Standard Core, and allocated 4GB of RAM but I got a message that says "Not enough memory in the system to start virtual machine".
 Now I thought since I have 16GB of RAM, a virtual machine with 8GB and another one with 4GB will run just fine.
 I allocated less RAM to my first machine, from 8GB to 4GB, and because it wouldn't install I tried again, allocating 2GB of RAM and it worked. I don't understand why it wouldn't let me use 4GB.
 ​
 Ammount of RAM on host - 16GB
 VM1 - 4GB
 VM2 - 2GB
 Host uses - 5GB
 So I have available 5GB of RAM.
 That being said, I don't understand why I couldn't allocate 2GB more to VM2.
 ​
 I know there is some allocation rule in HyperV I just can't find it, or I did and I still don't get it.
 How to calculate how many machines can I install and run with X ammount of RAM?

 Essentially, full audit of your O365 environment, literally everything from how users are set up to how different teams/share points are being used and privacy/sharing, to emails and domains, along with all security of physical networks and cloud environments, and assessment of end point/asset management. 
 This provider we hire would literally scour through EVERYTHING your company uses and touches … database/email/major applications/ banking credentials as well as the physical infrastructure and asset management and gives you the full good, bad, ugly on what is wrong security wise as well as inefficient structure or procedures to also show what can be done to automate and streamline management. And ideally this same company sells the services to execute too or there are recommendations on companies they take the results and offer services to fix and execute.
 Backstory: Recently joined a company as an executive and realize that its entire environment has been thrown together by a couple inexperienced IT support employees. No fault of their own, the company started mom and pop small business and rapidly exploded into a national player and these guys just kept the lights on. There is no asset management, no end point management, no understanding of how to streamline/control data, (literally zero governance), etc. To better know what we don’t know so we can add the right people to the existing team, we are hoping to pay lots of $$$$ to have a trusted company contracted to “fix” us up so we can take it from there.

 We already have a local admin , it is created when we install windows on the pc . Name local admin example : "admin" . We have laps installed but we want create another local admin because laps doesn't work good all the time . Second local admin : "admin2"
 We don't want create from domain !!
 Soo , i create a user admin2 and a group Local Admins . At user i add in Administrator group and in Local Admins add at membres admin2
 Then i create a gpo : Edit ->Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Restricted Groups -> add group and then i add Local admin
 After in "this group is a member of" i add Administrator
 I went to the PC I'm testing cmd -> gpupdate /force
 I checked from cmd -> compmgmt.msc -> Local Users and Groups -> Groups -> Administrator and GPO works ok is apply . See the "AD\Local Admins"
 it is not possible to see only the name? Idk group name "Local Adminis" or only "admin" without "AD\..."
 Run with administrator write admin2 and password again working
 But I don't understand if at the moment the user is from the domain or is local .The question is if the user applies from the domain or is it local ? if it's local, how can i do it, there is another way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow network engineers
 I am eager to develop greater networking skills and want to set up the most optimal and cheapest lab environment.
 For me, virtualisation is the best option for its scalability and variety. I have used both GNS3 and EVE-NG in the past (on my Windows computer with VMware Workstation/VirtualBox and even in the Google Cloud). I have enjoyed them both greatly but at the moment would choose EVE-NG.
 Right now I have a MacBook so virtualisation is not really an option for me since it is Silicon/ARM based. Google Cloud is too expensive for the amount of CPUs and RAM I need for a good lab (>24vCPU and 48RAM, also the resources are not always available in zones which is really frustrating). I could just buy a used bare-metal server for my virtualisation but I am not sure I will have room for it but it is an option I am considering.
 I need the to emulate different vendors so CML is not an option for me as well.
 Could you suggest the most practical and least expensive way to setup a lab?
 What has your experience been with it? Every little tip and suggestion is most helpful, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I'm new here. In short: there is a standalone server with Windows Hyper-V Server 17763. There is a VM with Veeam Backup&Replication, a VM with Windows Server 2019 (Active Directory), a VM with Windows 10, and a VM with Ubuntu (Samba). All machines in the test domain. I need to backup Windows Server 2019, windows 10 and ubuntu to a shared Samba folder. Ubuntu backed up without errors, but two VMs with Windows Server and Windows 10 back up with errors. Error example (from Edit Job->Guest Processing->Test Now):
 \green tick* Connecting to guest OS via RPC*
 \green tick* Testing admin$ share accessibility via RPC*
 \green tick* Testing guest OS connectivity via RPC*
 \red cross* Connecting to guest OS via PowerShell Direct*
 \red cross* Testing admin$ share accessibility via PowerShell Direct*
 \red cross* Cannot connect to VM*
 \green tick* Credentials and connectivity have been validated successfully for RPC transport* 
 What i tried:
  
From VMs (on Windows) the folder (\\NAME\admin$) opens normally with the data that i specified. I have tried turning this feature (Enable application-aware processing) on and off in the settings, the result is the same. 
  
This error is in the report:
 1) Failed to create VM recovery checkpoint (mode:Crash consistent)
 2) Failed to create VM recovery checkpoint (mode: Hyper-V child partition snapshot)
  
I tried using powershell to enable vss (vmicvss, vmicvmsession) settings on Windows VMs, it had no effect on the result.
 Changed checkpoint type from production to production-only in settings Hyper-V.
 Checkpoints from the hyper-v manager and from the hypervisor's powershell are created fine.
  
if any additional information is needed, please let me know. Thanks to all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Maybe there is an obvious solution to this that I don't see right away. 
 However, at my work location the inbound ISP connection is very close to some windows and a door. These could easily be broken into and if I place my network gear (NAS in particular) close to there, the thieves could just snatch them and be gone in like 3 minutes.
 Unfortunately, there isn't really anyothers placement inside the work location that is suitable for a serverrack, so I'm stuck with the options of
  
Mount metal rods across the windows and doors to prevent break in. This is not optimal because it's ugly as hell and will also trigger curiosity for the criminals who are looking. I would rather that my location seem inconspicuous.
 
Place the valuable gear inside some kind of safe that is also a serverrack. 
 
 Do you know of a product like this? 
 Any other ideas?
 I'm aware that if someone really wants to steal my gear, they will probably succeed. I just want to make it difficult enough for thieves to be discouraged or complicated enough to allow some time for security to respond to the alarm.
 Thanks

 i'm looking for a smartphone app for innovaphone IP811 on-premise. smartphones are 90% android, 10% apple, but apple not that important
 Mypbx-app 12r2 sr59 can be used to outgoing calls using company office personal number, and can be used for inconing calls using company office personal number mostly without call-forwarding
 any form of cloud is completely disallowed, my boss will ask if i'm sick if I recommend something cloudy.
 missing features are:
 a) boss seems to miss a list of incoming calls on his smartphone, he does not want to keep his boss waiting. 
 b) group calls do not work reliable, meaning five persons are assigned call group 70, all phones should ring when that number is dialled.
 what are options here?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in OEM pre-sales, so I don't have to deal with this shit directly as a customer, but we do partner with the various American service providers who resell our solutions and wrap managed services around it. 
 I've with providers in the past (as a customer), and I've alsoworked in pre-sales for a provider (Verizon), and from my experience,.. all of them are terrible... I can't avoid working with them, sadly, but if I have partner with one of them, I'd rather it it be the one who is least terrible.
 So, when it comes to AT&T, Verizon, Lumen, Specturm, and all the others, which one sucks the least? 
 My Impressions so far:
  
Verizon is horrdendous unless you're talking wireless-only.
 AT&T managed services are "ok", their systems are shit, their baseline circuit support is bad, but they have a good CSM & sales organization that helps alleviate the pain.
 Lumen - Never worked with them, I've heard a lot of bad shit, especially post-Level 3 merger... no clue where they stand these days. Seems like their managed services are bad but their circuits might be ok?
 Spectrum - Good circuits, no clue about the rest.
  
(Note: What I really care about is their ability to deliver enterprise-grade DIA circuits, as well as managed network & security services. Broadband is important too, but from what I've seen, it's something that varies significantly best on the location... and they're all about the same.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently migrated our last server to Azure. This was our file server which only served as file storage. Devices in the network would connect to the shares via a network drive. Mapped drives are setup with group policy. 
 We are connecting to Azure by a site to site vpn. Onsite are redundant Meraki MX250's and we have a meraki vMX in Azure. We have redundant 1Gb up/down fiber connections.
 File server VM specs: D2ds_v5 = 2cpu, 8GB RAM. Standard SSD's
 If I open a network drive on my computer and copy 30MB of files in one folder and paste them to another folder in the same network drive, transfer takes around 3+min. If I remote into the file server VM and do the same file copy and transfer locally it takes 2 seconds. I assumed file transfers would be a little slower since it is no longer onsite but this is much slower than it should be. It almost feels like Azure is throttling the read/writes or throughput. Anyone have any experience with this?

 Onto the question, I have everything scripted out with powershell basically checking the date, and if the date passes the 1st, it will run a script that changes registry to give a new wallpaper. The wallpapers are different every month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All! 
 I’ve got 2x DL360 Gen10 2019 “standard”servers. Both setup as RAID 10. Server1 is setup as a Hyper-V server hosting 4 vms (2016 servers) and roughly 15 TBs of data including an sql server that is the bulk of the data. 
 Server2 is identical to Server1; processor, ram, partitions,etc. This is a fresh server, only Hyper V installed. I have not moved/copied over any vms or data data, just installed a the same roles and applied some updates. Figured over a weekend I’d save off the VMs and import them into server2 and robocopy daily to sync data. Would this work? 
 My mission is to figure out a way to have the “in production” server1 in building A sync or mirror to server2 in building B (fiber). In the event of a disaster I’d be able to move server2 into production and keep folks working. Servers are on the same domain, network, vlan and can see one another. 
 Is it possible to set server1 up to regularly sync everything including vms and their data to server2 in real-time or hourly/bi-hourly intervals using robocopy? I’m okay with daily, but hourly would be better. MS best practices? Not opposed to 3rd party software, but would prefer a free Microsoft option if available (limited resources). 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! 
 Tldr, sync 2 identical 2019 standard servers with 4 hyper vms for disaster recovery using robocopy to sync data regularly.

Very little specifics on what they are aiming for or why and they also already are set up with a hybrid environment syncing AD to Azure with Azure AD Connect. The thought is they just don't want to be reliant on local resources; needing to be internal either on site or VPN to access shares for example. 
 What are some of the scenarios you guys have run into that worked well to satisfy the hunger to go cloud, even though they don't entirely understand what it means.
 Printing, file shares/access, account/device management, security, etc.

 The guys want to get better at documenting their work and we obviously need to get away from having all that info out of our lead tech's noggin. Most of our documentation is printed on paper and shoved into a file cabinet with the service info. 
 We'd like to be able to create circuit IDs for all of our paths and document all relevant info for connectors, patch panels, splices, buffer tubes, breakouts, splits, as well as important things like splice reports, OTDR reports, locate notes etc. 
 Could we use a tool like OpenDCIM for this, or is there something else we can deploy to get us started? If you've got any tips or advice to get me started I'd appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a confusing issue. I have a Win Server 2019 acting as a domain controller (PDC). From this server I am able to successfully ping all clients on the subnet, but I'm not able to ping the 1st hop Mikrotik Switch (crs326-24g-2s+rm). All other clients (including the server 2019 backup domain controller) can ping the Mikrotik.
 A tracert to the switch from the PDC server shows no connectivity, however the server is reachable from other clients connected to the switch.
 Tracing route to mt [192.168.x.y]
 over a maximum of 30 hops:
 1 * * * Request timed out.
 2 * * * Request timed out.
 3 * * * Request timed out.
 Thus far I have:
  
Rebooted the Mikrotik
 Rebooted the server in question (PDC)
 Changed ethernet cables
 Changed port the PDC is connected to on the Mikrotik to a port that another server 2019 instance was able to successfully ping from
 Tested ping from all other clients on the subnet
 Verified server IP is part of the same subnet as the switch IP.
 Disabled the windows firewall - had no impact
  
The PDC is directly connected to the switch. I'm able to ping the gateway on the other side of the switch, and am able to ping all clients connected to the switch.
 Network topology is quite simple. All clients connected to the Mikrotik, and a single router upstream connected to the modem.
 Any thoughts on how to re-establish pings from this server? I have a monitoring app that reports uptime from this server (I know...I know...shouldn't be on a PDC), and right now it is reporting the switch is down. This started yesterday. Previous to that there were no issues. No changes to the PDC have been made, which makes this even more confusing.
 Thanks everyone,
 Cal.

 I was authorized to enable MFA everywhere that it makes sense. We rolled it out for M365 this afternoon and management now has zero sympathy for the few users who complain about it.
 I just finished a meeting with my manager where we reviewed the questionnaire from our cyber insurance provider. He seems willing to spend time and money on the security controls that we're currently missing. I've brought up every one of these in the past, but where before he would say "Too expensive," now his comments are, "That seems reasonable," and "Our contracts require us to carry cyber insurance, so we should implement this."
 I am going to be busy, but I am so happy.
 Did any else suddenly get full go-ahead to implement security controls after their cyber insurance provider made it the obvious choice?

 On the other had we have a little known e-mail filter called Libra that was created by engineers that used to use filters so knew what they wanted and needed and pitched by those engineers that use it. Was a much better presentation and we liked it.

 I just installed a pair of 9800-L-F in HA mode (RMI+RP). RP ports are connected back to back and TE0/1/0 from each WLC are connected to the core switch.
 When I disconnect the f.o. port from the active controller the other one takes control, and that's fine. The former active controller, however, have to reboot itself before completing the active to standby transistion (don't know why it needs to reboot but that's the way Cisco decided...): if I reconnect the fiber cable BEFORE the unit is rebooted, it will completely freeze. No output whatsoever on the console and the box is completely dead until I disconnect and reconnect the power cable.
 Has anyone seen this behaviour?
 Bye, Dario

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I am getting tired of coming across unauthorised and unsecure devices on our network. I know NAC is the solution but our company is impotent and unable to sort out the management policy side of things to actually implement it. In the meantime I am scanning our network with various tools I have and kicking off devices that break the current policies I am allowed to enforce. Have been using Zenmap on Mac but was wondering if there was a better version or option out there that is free/open source? Perhaps something that can be installed on a server and present scans or reports in a nicer way? We have some other tools that can fingerprint but they mostly rely on DHCP relay to get info so are only useful for DHCP devices and don't see stuff on static IPs. Any suggestions of tools welcome. I appreciate this isn't cyber security sub but I am a network engineer and looking at ultimately discovering as many of these devices as possible to boot them off until management pulls their fingers out and allows us to implement NAC. Cheers.

 If you have a trunk interface with enough VLAN allowed entries that the cli displays the list as multiple lines with the “add” option e.g.:
  
interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport trunk native vlan 99
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,4,8,10,30,40,50
 switchport trunk allowed vlan add 202,241,342,400,1101
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport nonegotiate
 end 
  
When I use RESTCONF to interrogate the config with a URL like:https://<ip>/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native/interface/TenGigabitEthernet 
 The results only list the final 'add' line - and lose the 'switchport trunk allowed vlan' line:
  // "switchport": { "Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:mode": { "trunk": {} }, "Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:nonegotiate": [null], "Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:trunk": { "allowed": { "vlan": { "add": "202,241,342,400,1101" } }, "native": { "vlan": { "vlan-id": 99 } } } } 
 It appears it doesn't see the information regarding the config line:
  
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,4,8,10,30,40,50
  
Am I doing something wrong? Is there another way to get this information or is this a bug?

 We need to find an analytics solution to monitor our campus network. It is a large campus with 20k+ devices being used at a time. We have Extreme Cloud IQ currently and we are using the wireless and NAC portions of the software. It makes sense to use the Extreme option since we already have other products, but if there is a better solution, I would like to know. I would also like to ask if this would allow us more insight into upstream routing information, as we somewhat regularly have routing issues between our two ISPs (I can add more detail if needed). Incase our basic setup is helpful in forming your answer, our core is Extreme Networks and our firewall is Palo Alto and we have a full 10gb network down to the switches. Our end-user numbers are ~18k and each has ~3 devices.

 Should be easy, right? Nope, they have removed the ability to do that themselves, even if their Support Site says otherwise.

 So just a heads up to others planning on canceling: You have to fill out their Contact Form on https://support.lastpass.com/contactm and they will then call you (and try to convince you, not to cancel).
 To their credit, I got a call within 15 minutes.
 I hope I have saved others the time i wasted, trying to cancel on their Website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey.
 I have been looking at an issue again lately.
 The problem is that flow cache data in IOS XR does not contain src/dst AS, prefix lengths, etc.
 (I.e. all bgp attribute-download attributes)
 This is running netflow on an interface in vrf with mpls label allocation mode "per-ce".
 As per documentation:
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k-r6-2/netflow/configuration/guide/b-netflow-cg-asr9000-62x/b-netflow-cg-asr9000-62x_chapter_010.html
 ​
  
When the netflow configuration for VPNv4 or VPNv6 is applied in label allocation mode (either per prefix or per CE) then the IPv4 or IPv6 netflow do not capture the BGP attributes such as BGP nh, BGP AS numbers and prefix lengths; these attributes values are set to zero.
  
What is your take on this? I figure there must be someone else with the same architecture requirement who are facing the same limitation, who might have solved or worked around it in a way or another?
 If so, let me know what you did

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network guy here. I'm experimenting in a lab environment to test the feasibility of a DR strategy and a "make it or break it" caveat that I ran into is that I can't seem to find a way to tell windows to source requests that it initiates FROM the loopback adapter IP.
 Sure, it can listen on the loopback, and take in requests from it... but when I initiate a request FROM the server, it uses the NIC's IP address, which makes sense.. however I want to configure it to source all of these requests from the loopback adapter if possible, routing through the NIC.
 ​
 Example:
 NIC: 10.0.0.100/24 
 Loopback: 172.18.1.100/32
 If I am RDP'd into the server and go to https://www.google.com/, then run a "netstat -an | findstr 443", I will see this:
 10.0.0.100:52143 142.251.40.196:443 ESTABLISHED
 Where I'd like for it to look like this:
 172.18.1.100:52143 142.251.40.196:443 ESTABLISHED
 ​
 Does anyone know if this is possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Fellow Nerds, 
 I'm in search of a rough or direct equivalent to the watchdog daemon on Linux systems. 
 One Windows-based server I manage has an app that needs to run 24/7 basically, and it will typically lock up after a week or so, requiring us to remote into said server to restart the app. Not too big of a deal, takes a few mins. 
 I'm attempting to automate some such tasks in our org and I'm familiar with watchdog on Linux systems and was wondering if anyone knew of an equivalent service for Windows-based server platforms. Something that would simply ping the app or service every X minutes/hours and kill/relaunch the app if it doesn't respond, or if it's hung, etc. 
 My Google-fu is normally incredibly strong, but I'm not finding much for this one. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for your time gents and ladies.

My logs are filled with Google ignoring the 550 5.7.1 code and resending the hard bounced email for 3 days; has anyone had any success at getting Google to respect hard bounces and not resend them?
 By contrast, Microsoft totally respects them as in when my server hard bounces spam from outlook.com, I never receive it again. Since the drastic bulk of my spam comes from Google's servers, either from Gmail or the Google SMTP or Google API send, if someone has found a way to hard bounce Google successfully, please feel free to share, thanks.
 My logs are filled with the following; Google is clearly resending on a schedule where it tries to deliver the hard bounced email for 3 days at increasing intervals - so I end up getting maybe 20 of these exact same Google retries - until it gives up whereas it should be giving up the moment it receives the 550:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, just a quick ramble and I am curious how others see this scenario since it is a very common one. We have about 1000 users in our environment, everyone works from home 3 days per week. The users connect to a VPN from home, just like almost every other company.
 We've had MFA rolled out for a long time with SMS authentication, but recently one of the C-suites was targeted in a SIM swap. We're now switching over to an authenticator-based solution which requires users to have an authenticator app on their phones. It has been going well, but we have a small handful of users (about 10) who are adamantly against using their phones for anything work-related. These users all have smartphones, so there is no technical limitation stopping them from being able to install the authenticator app.
 My ideology is that phones, like internet at home, or like transportation to and from work, are all things that an employee are expected to have. Everyone already understands that they can connect to their own home Wifi to then access our VPN and connect to our corporate network, and that is taking some bandwidth from their other devices. I'm not really seeing the difference between those two use cases as we aren't monitoring their phones, or adding any MDM solution to them. They could feel that way but I'd expect them to already feel that way by connecting a corporate laptop to their home network.
 I know most companies provide cell phones or stipends to employees for phone services if they are expected to use their phones for work purposes but no employee is expected to do anything besides receive a 6-digit code to authenticate when logging in to our systems.
 Management requested us to just set up a group for users who refuse to just leave their policy to only require SMS authentication.

 I need to create a PKI, to be more specific a CA that delivers certificates for Fortinet Fortigate firewalls and Cisco Routers that will have IPsec configured on them.
 I am aware of the option to use one router as a CA server, I took that into consideration, but I wonder if I can create a CA on an ubuntu image so all the IPsec peers get their certificate from that server. Does anybody know any solution? Is it even worth it? Or should I just stick to the router option?
 What solution is used in a real-life scenario? I saw some equipment online like Fortinet FortiAuthentifier or something like that.

 My outgoing IP appears on 24 blacklists including 0spam, Ascams, SORBS, Backscatterer, etc.
 The TXT descriptions of some of these lists show clearly that my IP is on there because other users of my IP have misbehaved. There are subject lines of emails in the last two weeks like "Manpower from Pakistan", "Our Loan Products", etc., as well as send dates (anywhere between 2013 and 2023) which have absolutely nothing to do with me.
 I have DMARC, DKIM and SPF all correctly set up.
 Yet, my emails sometimes does not get through to certain recipients so I'm sure there are deliverability issues.
 Is it normal that a PAID email provider like Google Workspace will be sending your emails through a dirty IP?
 Another thread suggests setting up an outgoing proxy Amazon SES IP. I'm technical enough to do this, but is it worth it? How do I know that it won't be polluted as well?
 Any other solutions appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we now have SentinelOne. Its supposed to be good but its behaviour engine is becoming increasingly annoying.
 Lets take Process Explorer as an example. Its a well know Microsoft app, yet Sentinel doesn't like its PROCEXP152.SYS file. Its a "SignedKnownAndVerified", it knows it came from procexp64.exe, I have put an exclusion in
 c:\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 Yet it ignores this and flags it as malicious every time.
 It claims the file is loading here:
 \Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 So we put in 
 \Device\HarddiskVolume*\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 A star wildcard. But makes no difference. Flagging it in the console as a false positive appears to do nothing to stop it flagging it again.
 Anyone else had issues with SentinelOne's behaviour engine?

 The role is for an IT officer, so not quite sysadmin, but it's basically a frontline role, troubleshooting peoples issues, helping with their workflows and teaching groups how to use relevant software. 
 A bit of background on me. I have no formal IT qualifications, but I love technology and I have spent a lot of my career helping people out with their tech and workflows, having had friends in the IT department at a previous job who taught me a lot. I spend a lot of my personal time learning things. I've learned HTML, CSS and Javascript, Adobe Cloud and I'm good with office and Excel and I can easily pick up new software. I know that I'm more than capable of the role. 
 I would really like to get this job, given a complicated personal life with my wife's health, the role is ideal for a good work life balance. Can anyone give me any insight into what they will be looking for and how I can best impress. 
 Appreciate any and all help. 
 Thanks.

 now i dont know how this sysadmin knows that hell is about to break loose because 5 minutes to having some tampers flare or managers being involved about the delay, he will quickly create the accounts or do the required system changes then dumps the information to me, and as soon as an alarm is raised he will divert all the anger towards me saying he is working on your issue or he has the details you need or he is the one supposed to do xyz -which would be technically true but i couldnt have done it for the past 10 days because i was waiting for the sysadmin to make system changes
 now im looking like im stupid, slow or without a sense of urgence yet he was the one sitting on the tickets for a whole week, and i now have a tonne load of things to do in small amount of time on top of what i already have to do

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New day, new rant.
 Starting yesterday, we officially stopped supporting any HP printer (except high end enterprise printers). A few months back it was only the printers with an "e" in the model name. Now it's everyone of them.
 Why?
 Because installing a printer used to be very simple:
  
do a dhcp reservation
 connect the printer
 install drivers
 (optionally) deploy it with policies
 ​
 (solve the tons of problems any printer had since the 90's)
  
​
 for years, it took 10 minutes to unpack and mount and 10 minutes of software/drivers installation etc....
 ​
 Now, unpack the printer still takes 20 minutes (top).
 Working with small offices and small (20-400 people) companies that actually use low-to-mid-range printers, installing them on clients has now become a nightmare.
 You have to use that f***ing "HP SMART" application, downloaded from windows store. It's impossible to do that on servers, you have to use a customer's pc. And don't even try to connect a USB cable before completing the in-app procedure!
 Then half of those printers... they just doesn't work.
 A few of them doesn't connect to their "HP Web Services", the majority are stuck with a "complete the configuration..." message. Resetting, reinstalling application, jumping on a single foot, running a marathon, get a new cable, cutting the cable, using it as a whip...
 Nothing works. Returning and replacing it with any other brand is just easier and way faster.

 I've also posted this on homenetworking, but hoping I could also get some input here
 Hoping I could get some advise here. I've recently bought a house that is yet to be build. The expected delivery date of the house is Q2 of 2024.
 The house is a project build and during the build we have option. One of the option is the placement of ethernet connection. You might be thinking, why not do this yourself? Well unlike traditional house building where there is an "empty pipe" in the wall to pull your own cable. This construction will not have this. The cables will directly be pulled in the wall during the build of the house. I'm not allowed to do anything while the house is being build until I get my keys. By then hopefully all the walls are in place.
 Here is where I need you…]]></summary>

 What do I mean?
 So in my country they are using networks made specifically for densely populated areas for remote areas causing speed and performance drop in connection in rural areas. It involved redundant transmission routes. However, it focused on high commercial areas or the major residential areas of certain parishes. Where the return on investment was almost guaranteed, low geographic challenges and high value customers.
 Is there a topology/strategy I could implement that could work on a community level that would see a consistent network performance similar to urban areas that would be cost effective/not expensive to implement by a developing country that will positively affect low income/non-high value customers? 
 Also what simulation software I can use to test this infrastructure and how it performs to a different situations like high device count so we can narrow down a best possible infrastructure for a remote community?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was curious if this existed.
 The idea of having a self-hosted system that, if for some reason had to be taken down, could fall-back to a cloud-version sounds amazing.
 Some obvious caveats would include synchronizing critical file systems and services, but I'm curious if this has been done before.
  
What made me think of this in the first place is that I'm hosting my own mail server at home, but the thought of missing mail due to a hardware issue that could last a few days worries me. Would love to host myself, but fall back to something solid during harsh times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've noticed that with my company firewall, there are some web pages that are being blocked. 
 Most specifically login pages owned and operated by small companies. 
 Major Contendors like microsoft or adobe are not an issue, but smaller budget companies it's hit an miss on whether or not my firewall will let a login page load. 
 I've tried going into my firewall log files to trace the blocks and white list the Domains/ip's but even with those domains marked as enabled the loading screens fail to load. 
 However they work perfectly fine when I bypass my network and hotspot on my phone. 
 I'm running on the assumption that there's some secondary domain required for my whitelist before I can load the login pages correctly. 
 So the question is, can I record it? can I run some kind of tool on a web page while it's hotspotting on my phone to create a log of that all the web browser is trying to call so I can make sure the correct items are white listed in my firewall? 
 How would you go about resolving this?

 I'm the IT Manager for a local county. Our domain is appomattoxcountyva.gov We use Rackspace as our email provider. We are still receiving emails, but today at about 10AM our emails stopped sending, throwing this error:
  
host
 relay-webapps.rsapps.net[172.27.255.140] said: 550 5.7.26 550-5.7.26 This

 your message. Please fix your domain DNS configuration, Thanks!.
 (ZD/67D1379) (in reply to end of DATA command) 
  
We haven't needed to touch our DNS configuration in about 5 years. 
 Nonetheless, I logged on to zoneedit.com to adjust our settings.
 I used MX Toolbox and it shows our SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records all to be in the green.
 Still, no emails are sending from our domain.
 ​
 Admittedly I know very little about these records, because like I said we've never had to adjust them. 
 Am I doing something wrong? I would be happy to share any additional information as needed.
 ​
 If you can help at all, I sincerely thank you in advance.

 One of our helpdesk guys was getting this laptop ready to use as a loaner. Unfortunately I've broken our MDT server temporarily so they decided to image it with our Windows 10 installer from VLSC. They imaged it, connected it to our network, and now we have a screen that think's it's needing to be joined to another company.
 https://i.imgur.com/cZ0WYYz.jpg
 I'm just curious if anyone knows of a proper way to get this taken care of. We're not attached to it. It's out of warranty, but we would prefer to give it some more life at least as a loaner or through our recycling company that repurposes some computers for local non-profits.
 We bought this laptop direct from Dell too, not a 2nd hand one.
 EDIT: Thanks for the recommendations. Have a ticket in with MS. Just waiting for someone to get back to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is also an issue with our 3560 switches.
 Copper switch with a 4 port sfp module. These ports can do either gig or 10 gig speeds. We have 1 10 gig sfp in each switch and we are using that as our uplink.
 Why is it that when I do a show run on the switch, I see both gi1/1/1-4 and te1/1/1-4, as if there are 8 total ports, when really there are only 4? Is there a way to configure it to only show the 10 gig ports?
 And the reason I am asking is because it is not consistant on all of the switches. We are using 10 gig on all the switches, but some show the 1 gig ports in the running config and some dont. And this is causing some issues for some scripts I am trying to run. So just curious if there is a command I can run to get rid of the 1 gig ports from the running config. When I do a "show interface status", I do not see the 1 gig ports, only the 10 gig ports.

Does the AP need to support any 802.1x features or does it solely just pass the traffic back to the WLC to proxy to ISE? Could the AP impact the authentication or does it have anything to do with radius in this topology. 
 ​
 ISE = Authentication Server
 WLC = Authenticator (Proxy to ISE)
 Desk phone = Supplicant
 ​
 Another question was were could reauthentication originate from in this. I believe it could either be set in ISE under authorization policies or on the WLC in the global config or per WLAN. Co worker seems to think the AP could also impact reauth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of our remote facilities decided to DIY install an RFID door access system. As you'd expect, they went for the cheapest option off Amazon and some sketchy freeware. These:
 https://www.amazon.com/Access-Control-Supply-Converter-110V-240V/dp/B01MXY4FDN/
 and https://beseencontrol.com/
 The IT department only heard about it after they'd tried installing the software and connecting the controller to the network.
 The software is sketchy as hell. The business is based in China, there's no EULA or licensing, every reference to the software calls it something different and they're all super generic names.
 For all the red flags, I can't point to anything that proves it's dangerous. I really don't want to be the bad guy shutting down a project because I have a bad feeling. OTOH I am the company's security officer and I'll be responsible if/when this thing compromises our network or leaks sensitive information. 
 How do you handle this kind of thing without building a bad reputation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[India and a few other Asian countries is where level 1 and specific higher level issues are taken by Microsoft and many other companies because of course, money. I believe AI will eliminate those jobs but sysadmin jobs will be needed to be staffed by people. Also, higher level calls on server issues and PCs will also need onsite sysadmins. That's not even including server appliances, iot, WiFi, cyber security, and many others. 
 Companies have slowed cloud growth. Eventually we will see growth end and find that a lot of companies will continue with on-prem and private cloud servers over the massive outages from AWS and Azure. That will require hands on.
 What's your take?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had someone text me and ringing my phone on Sunday for something that is a new project but not an emergency. But somehow they expect me to work everyday including weekends. She went as far as kept texting late at night. So this morning she escalated to my manager as if I'm not doing my job. I understand this during business hours but it's as if they expect me to work over the weekend for something that's not an emergency and not responding to it results in an escalation and just making me look bad with management and not only that but it becomes retaliatory in the sense that they make a big effort to make me look bad and at the same time demand higher urgency in retaliation, like trying to make my life harder because I dared to not respond over the weekend.
 This is very usual at my company and the sad part is that company management sides with these bullies, because they're heralded as heroes of the company that keep moving it.
 Sorry for the rant, I just feel sometimes they feel we're not human.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, got a bit of a strange situation I stumbled upon. For reference this post deals with two separate sites that are unable to communicate with one another (or correctly at least). For simplicity I'm going to refer to them as Site A and Site B and the majority of the IT team including myself works at a different branch from the two.
 I first became aware of the issue when a member of the helpdesk team brought up that Site A can't communicate with Site B. Surface level this appeared to be true as he had run ping tests from the DC at Site A to the gateway at Site B receiving "Request timed out." response. However, Site B can ping Site A without issue... I assumed that this is some sort of blocking issue with one of the FortiGate's since one of the sites can send ICMP echo packets it wouldn't be a routing issue. But I see nothing related to the ping tests shown in the logs on Site A or Site B's FortiGate. I would run a pcap but the deployed models do not have onboard memory unfortunately.
 Then it started to get a bit confusing, I ran a trace route from a VM at Site A to Site B and it completed without issue. The sequence of hops was as follows: Site A VM -> Site A Layer 3 Switch -> Site A FortiGate -> Site B FortiGate -> Site B Layer 3 Switch -> destination IP.
 Out of curiosity I ran a perpetual ping test from Site A to Site B for 10~ minutes and shockingly saw a couple successful ping attempts among all the "Request timed out." responses (98% loss for reference). Site A is also able to communicate with all of our other sites without issue.
 Any advice or tips for this? This one is starting to make my head spin and I feel I may be missing something obvious.
 Edit: Forgot to mention - Site B responds to ping from all of our other sites without issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been picking up a relatively large project since the new year and I just need to vent about how it's driven me to levels of pissed-off I've not reached in years.
 ​
 Numerous times I've been given *link_to_wiki_article* around some of the systems I'm dealing with, how to access them, etc. only for the documentation to not cover it in the slightest, or to be so vague as to send you on a wild goose chase through nested folders of documents.
 ​
 There's nothing more frustrating than having people confidently tell you "follow the documentation explicitly, it covers everything you need!", only to immediately hit something not covered by the documentation and falling at the first hurdle.
 Adding to the frustration are quirks and such that I had specifically asked about because I suspected they may become an issue, only to be told "oh no, just do this" as per the documentation.
 *thing doesn't work*
 "Oh, that's not working because ____" (_____ insert thing I fucking asked about previously)
 ​
 Make sure you document the shit you assemble, folks.
 Especially if you're handing it over to someone and confidently pointing them to your incorrect or missing documentation.
 ​
 So far I'm counting about a week of wasted work from being led back and forth by different people that can't agree on the correct process, and it's really rubbing me the wrong way to hear "that's because of ___" as if I should just know already!
 If it's a known step, add it to the fucking documentation, you cretins!

There are a couple of ventilation shafts that I could run cables through, but they’re not along a corridor so I would have to punch holes through a tenant’s unit to grab the lines into corridors.
 But the elevator shaft is right there and would be so much easier. I have the tool to open the door and stop the elevator. If I run it through conduit it wouldn’t interfere with the elevator.
 Is that stupid dangerous? Have any professionals here run lines up a shaft? Is this a huge code violation??? Will I be featured in Darwin Awards??

 But what do you think? Is this true or BS? 
 The only thing I can imagine is that, if you are going for the application centric approach, so using whitelisting and contracts etc., that you don't need firewalls between each segment for east west traffic, obviously, perimeter firewalls are still needed.
 Correct?
 Also, if your ACI is based on a network centric approach, so no Contracts (expect a Contract to allow all) etc. then you would need 100% firewalls, like on any traditional network, right?

 So imagine you have a collapsed core design with 2 Core switches and 4 Access switches. (might add another AS in future)
 So I'd just connect every AS to each CS (so redundant uplink), run VRRP and L3 on the CS's, no need for STP (!WIN!).
 What benefits does stacking have in this setup? (Data stacking)
 -Do you not connect each AS to the CS in a stack?
 -you have a single SSH session to control the whole stack, fair.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time lurker, first time poster on this account, thanks for all the information shared. We have a corporate partner (CP) that manages an existing tenant. Meanwhile, we are our own standalone org and aren't required to use the CP's services. Being on enterprise M365 licenses, we've been able to use the Power Platform (Power Automate, Apps, BI, etc) with great success but we keep running hitting ceilings on what we can do without admin access.
 Some of those things would be account creation automation based on roles, dynamic group memberships, Azure AD (we have traditional on prem DC), SharePoint customization, use of Intune, etc. All that is cool, but when the C-Suite learned the CP can technically access all of our email, OneDrive, etc, they became very committed rolling our own tenant. 
 So here we are! We've been reading up on implementing a non-routable domain into a hybrid Azure AD setup, email management, MFA setup, what the a transition looks like for our end users, etc but we all know academic knowledge vs implementation experience are two very different things. Fwiw, our CP is supportive of the transition so bad blood and politics shouldn't be a factor here.
 What are your thoughts on best practices, things you would be looking out for, general advice given this scenario? 
 TL;DR We're moving away from a tenant managed by a 'provider' to our own in-house management, asking best practices, advice for setup, etc.

 The only information I've managed to find is that in case of need, I'll have to pay a 450€ diagnosis fee before I can even get an invoice for the actual intervention.
 The bosses want to stop paying for the warranty extensions and are asking what's the financial risk in case something happens.
 Thanks in advance for any info on that !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never expect much from Microsoft Support, it usually takes plenty of back and forth before you can ever make progress if it ever does happen. But my last experience with them left me dumbfounded.
 I raised a ticket for an issue that inadvertently affected all of our mobile users, and upon their first email to me I was told it would be escalated to their intune team. I recieved one email from intune support asking to provide relevant information, then radio silence for the next 3 weeks. I sent maybe 4 followups asking when I would get a response, but to no avail.
 Fast forward to today, I finally get an email from them saying they have been trying to reach out to me but I must be busy so they will archive the ticket. Scrolling through the email thread, yes they have been "trying to reach out", but all of their emails after the initial one to gather more info were sent to my email address except with the domain slightly misspelled. The thread is full of NDR's.
 I find it hard to believe that someone employed as an intune specialist would not realize that receiving NDR's that my email address does not exist would not realize that I'm not receiving the emails. And what a coincidence that they finally got my email address correct when sending the case closure email. I guess their reply button must have been broken and causing my domain to be misspelled on all the emails where they try to offer assistance.
 Anyways I'm just here to rant, after several days and hundreds of re-enrollments we have gotten things under control. My already rock bottom expectations from Microsift support have reached a new low.

When working from home I always RDP into my office workstation and for the most part I've had no issues. I have a 3 monitor setup at both work and home. The office workstation is almost 10 years old, and I'm attempting to upgrade to a newer box which is much better equipped but RDP access to the box is much slower, lags, and the most annoying thing is that upon connection the screen flashes black for a couple of minutes (but not every time) before finally settling down. Performance when physically at the box is good, definitely better than the 10yr old box. Both are in the same OU, Have the same Windows 10 Enterprise image, and have the same Group Policy applied. I've disabled the RDP hardware graphics acceleration which my research shows to be a cause of the flashing screen upon connection. I use RDP in the course of my daily routine on various devices and have never encountered an issue like this, RDP is generally something that just works and most of the time I can't even tell that I'm connected to a remote box. It doesn't appear to be a client side issue or a multi monitor issue, performance is consistent if I'm connected across the VPN or locally from any device and no errors are indicated in the event log. 
 For a number of functional and psychological reasons I need a physical box that I use both when at home and at the office. Do you have any recommendations on how to improve RDP performance on this new box? 
 Here are the specs:
 New:
 HPZ2 G9 i7-12700, 32GB ram, Nvidia RTX A2000
 Old:
 i7-3930K, 32GB ram, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660

 I have had a look at recent posts regarding this, but most are a few years old.
 In trying to find a replacement for our current IT Helpdesk solution, I have noticed that Microsoft have a pre-cooked IT Helpdesk template available for people to setup as a Teams SharePoint site:
 Template info can be found here.
 My questions are:
 Anyone out there currently using this? 
 How are you getting on with it?
 How comparable is it to other helpdesk solutions you have used? 
 How does the Microsoft Lists integration work with regards to logging, managing, and interacting with users? 
 Are email notifications a thing when tickets are updated/assigned?
 Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for insight!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've now had 3 usb-c monitors with built-in hubs fail - could my set-up be causing this or am I just very unlucky with hardware ?
 My set-up is a work laptop connecting via single USB-C to a Dell monitor, daisy-chained via DP to another Dell monitor. Primary Dell monitor has built-in usb-c hub with peripherals such as webcam, mouse, keyboard etc connecting to this.
 Failures - 
 1) U2419HC lasted about 18 months then usb hub stopped working. Video was fine. Tried swapping cables, using different laptop, no joy. 
 2) Dell replaced first monitor for U2422HE. This worked fine for 2 months then again usb hub died
 3) Dell replaced again, for U2421E. This has lasted just over 3 weeks, and again usb hub has died. Literally working for few hours in the morning, now no peripheral is detected. Multiple power cycles of laptops, monitors and unplug then re-plug usb devices to no avail.
 ​
 Are usb-c monitors known to have very cheap/flaky hubs ? 
 Could something I am doing be responsible for breaking the hub somehow ? I can't see how as my usb devices are nothing unusual - logitech mx keys wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, logitech webcam, Majority RS1 microphone.
 Any suggestions welcome...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a team of 12-16 Architects working locally in an office, with other team members in different countries and many users working from home from time to time.
 Several years ago, we installed and implemented Egnyte to combine local and cloud storage with a simple NAS. Since then we have migrated to their hybrid drive solution with an expensive ,windows server running the server software and a windows plugin on each computer serving files from the cloud or the server, depending on location. The search path for all files remain the same. A great server solution with hardware costs remainso nothing. Useful and straightforward, in theory.
 In reality: The service is expensive since we have a lot of server data (around 10TB) and the hybrid software makes the work in our CAD software very slow since each work session loads hundreds of files and the hybrid software/server solution becomes incredibly slow. In reality, we need to sync all folders locally even when we are on our LAN with a server.
 As an administrator without any professional knowledge of IT systems, it is near impossible for me to find other alternatives and compare the pricing and functionality. We will need to get out of this as soon as possible.
 Which Egnyte alternative should we look into? 
 (Sorry for the low-quality question.)

 I don't want to use Azure AD or a third party service (yes, I am aware it's probably smarter or safer). I have a huge handful of applications and services, both on and off site that require login (obviously) and we have the option of LDAP authentication. 
 Is it safe, smart, or even possible to have an LDAP server that faces the internet to help authenticate users?

 Also, this is for my home network, just i wanted to be more professional to setup a domain for 3 computers. Is this subreddit right?
 The story:
 Years ago, i setup a Debian vm to act as a domain controller in my home network, two W10 PCs and 1 W11 PC.
 Because Samba 4.9.5 (the latest for Debian 10) doesn't play nice with windows 11 22H2, I tried to install samba 4.17 from Debian-backports but i'm a linux n00b and I accidentally wiped the VM.
 "LOL, let's try again, let's restore the latest VM backup" - I told to myself.
 the problem is that the latest VM backup is one year old and doesn't have the W11 PC on it. If i rejoin the domain, will I lose the account on the W11 PC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 A bit of background - I'm technology lead for a company of ~100 users. I manage a small team that is responsible for support and development of in house LOB applications and I am also the escalation point/main point of contact with our MSP who support our Active Directory, Microsoft 365, device setup etc.
 ​
 We have a problem at the moment where our main customer service inbox is at 98% capacity in Exchange Online. We have an in place archive with a retention policy that archives mail older than 3 months and it is increasing in size so we know it is working, but the rate of inbound mail seems to be greater than the mail that is being archived as the inbox size isn't decreasing.
 ​
 To help resolve this we've created a new inbox (which I will refer to as the Customer Service History inbox from here onwards) and we've asked our MSP extract all email sent/received before 01/01/2021 as a PST file to upload into the customer service history inbox - then they will delete all mail sent/received prior to 01/01/2021 from the live customer service inbox.
 ​
 Due to the size of the PST file our MSP is struggling to do this.
 ​
 We had hoped initially that we would be able to use the SearchMailbox PowerShell cmdlets to copy mail across inboxes rather than having to do a PST export/import but these cmdlets have been retired in Exchange Online and I couldn't find a suitable replacement PowerShell command that works.
 ​
 The industry I work in requires us to retain customer emails so we can't just delete all the old mail.
 ​
 Does anyone with more experience in this area have suggestions about what we could try?
 ​
 The ideal outcome is that:
  
The customer service team can still access old emails for complaints/compliance/legal cases
 The main customer service inbox stays well below 98% capacity (for at least another year)
  
​
 ​
 Thanks,

 Has anyone seen this issue? I have been looking for a fix to disable this 'drive check' when opening apps or their files. 
 Yes, network drives are old-fashioned and I want to get rid of them too but it's a slow process as they're ingrained in lots of stuff at this company.

 Let's take AWS as an example.
 The question is: does AWS different data centers, distributed across a wide geographic area, show a considerably more stable connection, from latency point of view (RTT), than the connection of say a random client and server, connected across the same geographic area?
 For instance, if we measured the RTT between two data centers of AWS, one in Australia, and the other on the West Coast US, does that connection any more stable than say one client in Australia connected to a server in California?
 Or do these data centers have no unique connection between them whatsoever?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I started managing a software deployment system and the current image is deploying multiple dotNet packages to a Windows 10 x64 image. How does dotNet Framework versions work, are they backwards compatible?
 We are deploying 3.5 SP1, then 4.5.1, then the patching automatically updates those.
 Would it be enough to simply deploy the latest dotNet Framework version and it would be backwards compatible?
 Or is this a bit like Java, where applications programmed for it expect a certain version and it has to be exactly that one, so you might end up with multiple dotNet Framework installations?
 Many thanks!

 we have a client that wants to refresh the WLAN infrastructure (Interasys) and bought two 9800-L appliances with X many APs. The appliances are directly connected to the ICX core switches with 4x fiber uplinks.
 On the WLC side the configuration is straightforward and consists of:
 - MGMT+RMIs in VLAN 1 (MGMT). Yes I know, it is recommended not to use VLAN 1 but that's the reality and the client can't change this right away and maybe does not want to.
 - 5 VLANs for SSIDs.
 - One VLAN (VLAN 10) for access points as per request from the client. The existing WLAN infrastructure is an old Interasys System with the APs on a separate VLAN and separate physical link to the core. We tested first with VLAN 1.
 - The uplinks are configured as trunk of course and on the native VLAN side …]]></summary>

 I need advice/solutions that can work with the ballsache that I have at the moment.
 We are running Jira 7.5, this uses basic auth to pull tickets for support mailboxes
 MS doesnt do basic auth, but our domain provider does
 So a solution that kinda works was implemented
 Basically, you mail itsupport@stupidasscompany and it gets forwarded to itsupport@seconddomainforsupidasscompany where Jira picks it up and logs a ticket for you
 Problems, Sometimes the end user (external clients) get a bounceback
 Bounceback shows client@stupidasscompany instead of client@clientsrealdomain. If the client mails the same mail, it goes through. Fails are random
 So verification is failing. I have disabled verification on the domain provider's side. But this hasnt fixed the issue
 Oh and our company makes use of 365 
 The bigger bosses dont want to upgrade Jira becuase of legacy costs... We cant move away from it as the company has managed to implement it in too many systems...
 Basically im screwed at the moment and would love some light in this tunnel.
 Please dont judge me too harshly. Im working with what i have

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am hoping someone has a hint for me. One of our clients has a Dell SAN, which has an "access" LUN that is used for inband management connectivity. The LUN is published to all hosts, and that cannot be changed from the SAN (AFAIK).
 One of our people build two new hypervisors recently, both of which have attached this "access" disk along with the legitimate volumes they need. It appears in disk manager as a 20mb offline disk. Diskpart tells me it is set to be read only.
 The issue I can see is the system log being overrun with constant NTFS errors, all pointing to the GUID of this disk.
 I want to take this disk offline on the hosts, but not sure about any possible ramifications (it seems OK since it looks like some sort of named pipe style channel for use by the dell management utility), and not sure the safest way to remove the volume without affecting the other LUNs on the same iSCSI target.
 Does anyone have any hints or tips for me?
 Thanks for the help.

 We just deployed a new RDS broker running windows server 2022 version 21H2 build 20348.1487, the licensing runs on a separate vm, with two server session hosts. During day one of its use in the main environment to user terminals no one could connect and they would get just blue color(not BSOD) screens or black, pulseway monitoring would be showing the system online and offline repeatedly. we would have to hard shut down the server. The system would come up, users could connect and pulseway reported normal and show the below errors, then the system would run normally for some time but then it would repeat in the same pattern. 
 multiple
 A timeout (90000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the iphlpsvc service.
 then this would come up 
 A timeout (90000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the NlaSvc service.
 ​
 This happens every day since its deployment, and I can not find any rhyme or reason for it, it's the only system doing it, it is not the only windows server 2022 standard in operation. 
 Has anyone come across this issue before? I can't really find anything on this, it is easy to mitigate right now but the force shutdowns are going to take a toll.
 Thank you for any help!

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring organizations”) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders about malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software—ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk—which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts.
