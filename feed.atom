        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm seeking assistance regarding an issue with our server, and I'm hopeful that you could provide some insight. We have encountered a problem involving a specific user who reported an inability to perform copy/paste actions between the RDP server and their local machine. Intrigued, I decided to investigate the matter personally, only to discover that indeed, the functionality is not functioning as expected.
 My quest for solutions led me to attempt terminating the RDP Clip Monitor service via the Task Manager. Regrettably, this endeavor yielded no positive results.
 It's worth noting that our company employs BitDefender as our security solution, although I currently lack access to the administrator console. Could it be plausible that BitDefender is impeding the functioning of rdclip.exe? In such a case, would it be prudent to add rdclip.exe to the exclusion list?
 I am truly hoping that your expertise and experience might shed some light on this situation. Your assistance would be immensely appreciated. Thank you in advance!

 We're in the middle of migration to Sharepoint from our ancient file servers. I was aware of the SP limitations and went with this bit regarding OneDrive path lenghts (we sync the libraries to pcs):
 "The length of the OneDrive root folder (e.g. C:\users\meganb\OneDrive - Contoso) + the relative path of the file (up to 400 chars) cannot be more than 520 characters."
 Turns out I can't open any file from synced library if its path is longer than 260 characters which changes things dramatically. I am aware of Windows max path etc. but my question is did MS got their doc so wrong and forgot to mention Windows max path or I am missing something here?

 Boss has been putting me under serious pressure to remove the license agreement text from some open-source software we use because he doesn't want the client to know that it's free. Never mind that removing the license is a breach of said license.
 I've held up so far with arguments varying from "I don't know how..." to "that's illegal, and as a coder myself I won't remove attribution from someone else's code so you can make more free money from it!"
 He tries to justify it by saying "we're paying for server costs!" and "what are the chances of them finding out really?"

 - Taking on a client with no office, only remote staff. Not a problem on it's own.
 - We use our own RMM/PSA that is built in house. None of that fancy Datto, N-Able or somesuch RMM over here.
 - Remote connections currently rely on VPN to our clients. Not authorised to use anything other than VNC. Of course I don't want to just use a separate remote access program for this client either.
 - Quick assist would be the short term dirty hack
 ​
 I'm thinking the only way to not get in this situation again is to advise we switch our remote access solution to something that uses a cloud based proxy. Any other recommendations?

 First time posting here. So I may not have the correct way to publish a post
 We have implemented Wired 802.1x (certifcate based) with NPS (Win Server 2019) in our company, everything is working fine with Windows 10. 
 We are now making some test to deploy Windows 11 but the connection goes wrong and we are not able to have a success with a former working Win10 laptop which migrate on Win11. 
 We have now a pop wich require action and we cannot success any authentication.. 
 ​
 The policy is pushed by GPO. We use the same policy for Win10 and Win 11. 
 We have tried the certificate way and user/pswd, same issue
 ​
 Have you ever experienced that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand how NAT works in case of communication between one, local host and a server with specific public IP address. The host is sending a request, it pushes the packet with destination IP address set to the value of servers IP address to the router . That LAN router "remember" that our host (identified by private IP address) is sending request to the server. So it is able to forward the response from a server to the proper host. (By the way, how does it distinguish responses from the server when multiple hosts from one LAN send requests at the same time?)
 Now, lets say we have two hosts, based on two standard local networks on Internet, which are not related with eachother. Is it possible to these hosts to communicate with each other, with NAT, but without any kind of servers between, providing the services to communicate? In that situation, we dont need to send any kind of request between them.

A while ago the whole IT infrastructure team was fired and only I remained. No one was handling inventory and purchase requests, and after a while I'm out of laptops and general equipment like cables and what not and I am getting flack for things not working properly when I don't have equipment and I don't have a direct onsite superior that handles this, head of IT is ERP strictly and doesn't handle anything other then the ERP, they hired an IT director located on the other side of the globe that has no idea what's going on on-site. I'm standing my ground and insisting that these things are not under my responsibility and I am not supposed to be a replacement to a company employee. I got blamed for an employee getting injured because he tried climbing on a ladder to activate a conference pc instead of waiting for me to get there and set it up. I said I set it all up and needed no more then 5 minutes and I was there around 10 minutes before the meeting ,but they decided to do it anyways and then they rode on that to blame me for low meeting quality. The reality is the conferencing equipment is faulty and I had it all setup to work as best as it could, but because I don't even have a fucking printer cable I can't connect the microphone to the PC so audio quality sucks regardless of when I got there and they are insisting I'm the one not doing his job properly.

 What I want
 10.0/16 - admin (this has like one network ID, one or two hosts and broadcast, so this might only need to be /30)
 10.10.10/24 - main
 10.10.20/24 - guest
 10.10.99/24 -iot
 10.20.10/24 - rental1
 10.20.20/24 - rental2
 Am I just far off what’s normal here? Am I causing network lags by using two octants in vlans for separation?
 Should I for some reason try to limit the host-bits as much as possible for performance?
 My thinking is that the firewall rules will be simplified by not allowing 10.20 and 10.10 to speak to each other. I will also separate the other networks to not allow communication, however I am debating if I should allow 10.10 to speak to 10.99.

I receive a message “Please ensure that the port through which the device is managed has the proper settings and is a member if the new management interface”.

 What interval do you patch? Do you have standing windows?
 How many of your systems are automated and how many get hand patched?
 Do you use custom scripts beyond just running yum update and rebooting such as restaring services or stopping services before a reboot?
 What specific tools do you use and in what manner?
 (I have a team right now who is hand patching 200 servers and insists they're too fragile to automate RHEL patching because various vendor applications are so fragile and hard coded to specific versions of applications and they're incredibly unwilling to do anything else and as a result of patching it all by hand they waste hours and hours a month)

My understanding is that all the peers are sitting on the same stratum, and if I understand it correctly, all NTP clients will see all the NTP peers are at the same level of stratum, but when each NTP server are all running without peering, the stratum might change and NTP clients might leans towards one of the NTP server and create a bias, am I correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need a sanity check here. Our VP recently received some complaints that our i-Series server is taking forever to run database queries (2 min+) and telnet sessions are lagging. They are convinced it's a network issue as pings from user desktops and other servers to this i-Series server are getting occasional 4-15ms response times. I am being told these ping results are unacceptable and must consistently be 1ms or less as it's a local server and it was always <1ms before it was moved to a vlan from a flat network. The server in question is running on a 4x1gb lacp agg and there are no port errors to be found. The uplink on the switch is 10gb and operating nominally. Am I crazy for thinking these expectations are ridiculous? Out of all my testing I can't find any reasonable evidence to suggest this is a network issue.

After doing a packet trace I could see that the window size was requested to increase a few times before it died.
 I tried setting the sysctl settings net.core.wmem_max and net.core.rmem_max from 212k to 12M. This did resolve the issue. Now I'm left wondering if I should just modify this on all of our servers, look at reducing the window size Netscaler sends, or if something is wrong with the calico k8s internal networking.
 I'm curious if anyone has ran into a similar issue and how they solved it. Ideally I'd like to tune the environment for the fastest transfers, but not at the risk of causing new issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, apologies if this isn't the right forum.
 Background: 
 For the past few years I've been teaching technology at a small private school. Our computer lab is a steaming hot mess that I've pretty much ignored as we have a 1:1 chromebook program. The lab has a bunch of half-functional ancient PC's, many of which I never had the admin password to. We also have a bunch of ancient ipads that were a PITA (set up with like 10 different itunes accounts, & near zero documentation). 
 Current Technology:
  
We have Cisco/Meraki networking service which I am not involved in managing.
 
Internet provided by Comcast
 I personally use Google Admin to manage google accounts & chromebooks. My experience here is basically setting up accounts/resetting passwords, and adding certain chrome plugins/apps.
 
100+ issued chromebooks.
  
We are supposedly on tap to receive a dozen+ brand new HP desktop computers (and a number of new ipads) for the lab and I would like to avoid the sh*t show that was the previous computer network that just used single, local, "student" accounts along with a (poorly documented) admin account.
 I've done a bit of research and I'm wondering if a combination of the Meraki Systems Manager and Google Credential Provider for Windows could provide for an adequate solution without having to set up an Active Directory server (which I have no experience with). 
 Having students use their Chromebook login to access the desktops would be IDEAL. So I was very excited to learn about GCP for Windows. And the Meraki Systems Manager seems to offer a very robust set of features. 
 ​
 TLDR: Here are my ultimate questions
 1) Am I on the right track with wanting to go the route of Meraki Systems Manger + Google Credential Provider for Windows? 
 2) What kind of configurations/settings should I make sure to enable for PC's in a school computer lab?

When I look at Lab Management, there are 2 labs with the same name, and one has disk space usage equivalent to the original lab, but I can't get to it. No matter which lab I click to open, it always takes me to the new one with no config. THe UUID of the labs are different, but i'm worried I'm going to lose all my configs in the original lab. Anyone know of a solution to get my original lab back?

 HPE support told me to go to the Microsoft eval center where you can get an evaluation of Windows Server 2022. You can get an eval key. Can I use my actual license key with the eval ISO? I seem to remember you can't do this. Instead you need to install and activate the eval key, and then use some command line voodoo to convert the edition and insert your actual product key.
 Is this really the standard practice way to get Windows installed on a brand new server? (I bought the Windows license when I ordered the servers, which is why they came with the Microsoft product key sticker)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm helping a local charity setup a Wi-Fi network in a community hall, as a bit of background we are re-opening the hall as it has been left unmaintained for the last 3-4 years. The charity has very limited funds and there are a few essential repairs that need to be made. Adding wifi is currently sitting in the nice to have category rather than essential, we do have existing network cables running through the building which I am hoping we can leverage.
 I've reached out to a few vendors and asked for their recommendations, but the products they are recommending are Wi-Fi 6 - Our budget won't stretch that far and I also think WiFi 6 is going to be excessive for our needs.
 Our internet traffic will be 1-2 staff PC's and a point of sale terminal, there will be a free guest Wi-Fi service but this doesn't need to be superfast to begin with. All traffic is going to be going out over the internet, with very limited traffic within the local area network.
 From a hardware perspective I think we need 4 access points and a PoE switch (So they are easier to install). I'm think of going with the TL-SG105PE switch, this provides Gigabit speed, 65W of power and its managed (The unmanaged option is only £7 cheaper). For the access points I'm debating between EAP115 and EAP225, the EAP225 is obviously faster and futureproof but its obviously a bit more expensive, I cold start with an EAP115 and then upgrade to EAP225 at a later date and reuse the EAP115 somewhere else in the building if we needed to.
 A couple of other factors, our internet on day 1 will probably only be 150Mbps but if the demands grows quickly then this will be upgraded so I'm trying to balance futureproofing with budget.
 Also I need to check what type of network cable is currently installed in the building, if its only Cat 5 then that will obviously be a limiting factor for any Gigabit hardware we have.
 I'd appreciate any comments/feedback people might have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like our jobs are so incredibly vast, there is always so much to do, so much to learn, but I find myself just staring at the screen being bored out of my mind some days. Maybe it's not having found the right niche or company? I'm specializing on networks, security, applications, automation, etc but it's all just a lot that doesn't necessarily hold my interest yknow? Maybe IT is just the wrong career for me? I make decent money, with great upwards mobility at my company, but it's just.... boring. 
 I figure if we have to spend all day every day doing something it's inevitable to end up being boring though right. There's nothing else in my life I would consciously choose to do 40 hours a week. It would get old, fast. Any advice from those in my spot, how did you adjust, or what enabled you to become engaged again vs just zoning out at every task you're required to finish?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently am managing a legacy application that was setup years ago and the code base become a write only. It uses legacy php and I am looking for a more modern alternative.
 The site just sits and serves up web pages. Each facility has its own web page and they are served up accordingly. 
 What is important though is to allow the managers to edit the web pages in order to display deals and general information. Currently the service has a login that they login with to update the information on the main page. This needs to be fairly simple and intuitive and the manager shouldn't be able to edit other pages or change major characteristics about the site like the title or the theming. 
 I am trying to recreate this functionality in WordPress but it doesn't seem to be possible without tons of plugins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Curious to get some opinions. We have an aging physical file server that needs to be migrated. This server has about 200GB of data, 120,000 files, and 10,000 folders. Currently, everyone is set up to use a mapped drive to access their documents.
 I like the idea of creating a SharePoint document library and migrating all the shares up -no more servers or updates to manage. However, I'm concerned about the user experience with the lack of a mapped drive. Microsoft used to support mapping a drive to a document library, but they’ve moved away from that technology. I tested syncing the main share to my local OneDrive, but the overhead of syncing that large of a folder was terrible. It seems that any large folder adds significant overhead for syncing to OneDrive. I'm concerned about mass-deploying that. 
 What path would you take? Would you move forward with migrating to SharePoint or spin up a new Windows server VM and keep the current on-prem server and mapped drives?
 Roughly 100 people will need access to these files. All users have Office 365 E3 licenses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got hired for a non profit as the old IT person had left. I was told that I would be trained by other IT person but they left me in the dust and I have had to learn their system by myself. I am not a system admin at all, I am in my second year of IT with a bachelors in IT and I am in my main learning phase. I feel really out of my element and am questioning if I know anything about IT everyday lol.
 The system I inherited is a server room with 7 servers, a mail server, dns, etc. We have 4 locations.
 My supervisors want to move to cloud and office365. We don't even have AD anywhere in this place. It isn't like this is a small business either, about 150 users day to day. (nonprofit)
 I have experience supporting these environments, but I have never built one from scratch. I am both excited and scared for the challenge! I guess my question is where do I start?
 My first step was to get every computer on the same version of windows which I have just recently completed (one of my older coworkers was using XP)
 I was going to start by building AD for the business to have some control over what we have, but since we are moving to the cloud I was questioning if we leave on prem behind? I am a proponent of more of a hybrid system, but my higher ups really want to push for a full cloud based system(Pretty sure htey just like the buzzword and don't actually know what that entails). I have read online that most people prefer a hybrid solution, but that's mostly when they are upgrading their system, not starting from scratch. I have a chance to build the system exactly how I want here I just have no idea where to start!
 I would be appreciative of any suggestions or ideas! I am going through this solo and would love the support (:
 ​
 ​
 EDIT: Thank you for everyone who gave suggestions, I am more excited than nervous now haha. I wish you all the best!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is just a heads up to anyone who is currently ordering direct from Dell. Your sales rep may have been let go yesterday and with that you'll be shuffled around to a new rep. Dell is once again doubling down on using VARs like ours to support their customer base from a sales/sourcing perspective. They will be paying the existing reps more on their commissions to drive you to buy from VARs so they can support more customers at a lower cost.
 If you are not buying from a VAR today, reach out to a trusted VAR and get that relationship going for your Dell hardware. At least have this as a back up as more and more fat is going to be trimmed at Dell we are hearing and this is just the first axe. 
 Happy to answer any questions on what I know, but here's the main industry article with more details: https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/dell-layoffs-linkedin-posts-show-job-axe-falls-hardest-on-sales

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm configuring an ASA for one of our lab environments. It's been awhile since I've touched an ASA.
 I have 11 Subinterfaces configured on one interface. Each subinterface has a vlan and subnet configured on it. All subinterfaces need to communicate with each other. They are all security-level 100 (though, I have tested lowering the security level of one and testing between...didn't work).
 I do have 'same-security-traffic permit inter-interface' configured.
 An example of the configuration is:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/7
 description Connected to SW100 GigabitEthernet0/1
 no nameif
 no security-level
 no ip address
 !
 interface GigabitEthernet1/8.10
 description Management VLAN
 vlan 10
 nameif Management
 security-level 100
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
 !
 interface GigabitEthernet1/8.20
 description Location A VLAN
 vlan 20
 nameif LocationA
 security-level 100
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 !
 I can ping the default gw of each network when I am on that network. However, I cannot communicate between them. I have also tried creating extended ACL's to allow the communication, and that is not working either. (I also attached the access groups to the interfaces).
 What am I missing here?
 EDIT:
 It's likely my traffic has been working for a while it seems.
 However, I had at least two problems regarding the tests. 
 1.) I needed to add some icmp permits
 2.) I was testing the connectivity by pinging the default gw's, which is apparently not supported from other networks. Once I had devices permanently on the other networks, I was able to ping those addresses and verify connectivity.
 Massive headache...but it's working.
 Thanks for the help all!

Starlink doesn't offer Static IPs and unless you have the business plan you don't even get a routable IP. Because of this, I don't believe we could use an IPSec because of the need for static IPs but instead the idea is to use a SSL/TLS Site-to Site VPN. 
  
Is an SSL/TLS Site-to-Site VPN the only option because of the lack of static or routable IPs?
 In AWS, would you do this via an AWS Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) or would you set up an OpenVPN Access Server? What are the pros and cons?
 
If using the VGW, what software FW (or any client SW) would you put on the client side? Like a pfSense or IPFire?

To get us by I signed up for send grid and we’re having the same issues. I opened up a ticket with Microsoft and they said they would escalate this issue. Is anyone having the same issues?

 A bunch of them has RED15 boxes, which are EOL in a few weeks, so they need to be replaced, as our MSP says they first will be a security problem, and next will stop working completely.
 The MSP has recently replaced their network people, and all I hear about now is Fortinet. As a replacement, they are suggesting Fortigate site 2 site products with UTP, which I am sure are great, but it also mean doubling to tripling the branches network costs.
 When I ask for alternatives, I am told there are none, and that if we picked something else, it would be lacking a lot of important security, which pretty much leaves me with no other options, which I'm questioning, as I feel it comes down to the network technicians religion.
 I know software VPN could do the trick on each of the computers, but then there is printers at all branches with various types of pull printing, which needs to be connected to the main network as they are installed on the print server.
 Do you guys see any alternative solutions that won't require us to break the bank? How about a SD-WAN solution?
 Thanks in advance!

 I can't seem to find away to mark old laptop to disable after 30 days. 
 Any thoughts?

 Backstory: I've been administrating on prem Exchange for 20 years. We are being forced into M365 licensing due to costs, and our M365 tier includes Exchange. We would be foolish to double dip licensing to maintain an on prem server. 
 Exchange is hosted on VMWare. We have a 3rd party email security gateway and KB4. Veeam for backups. We are a split DNS AD environment. 
 I am working towards my certs to manage Exchange in the cloud. However, we are moving fast on this and I am not going to be ready in time. I know enough to know that I don't know enough. I need a reliable company that can architect the transition and assist with the migration. 2k users, about 2 TB of databases (we are in a regulated environment where we maintain all email for a very long time). 
 Looking for recommendations. Thank you!

 When faced with an Onboard Administrator (OA) module replacement on a C7000, you may encounter a situation where the replacement module comes with a vastly out of date firmware.
 In this example, we have an active Onboard Administrator (OA) module running firmware version 4.97, with a replacement module running firmware version 3.11.
 When plugging in the replacement module, you would be presented with a Standby Onboard Administrator in a degraded state, with messages such as:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! We've been using Bitlocker for about 3 years now after moving away from DDPE. Everything worked great up until a yearish ago. We always know the day after patch day now because it inevitably triggers our fleet of laptops to request a bitlocker recovery key. It didn't use to do this and it isn't the same people every time. We're a Dell shop, so I've contacted Dell and they sent me some support articles* that I had already found and tried on my own, but of course they didn't help. Dell was real quick to flip it around and say "Microsoft problem. We don't control Bitlocker."
 Had our MS admin put in a ticket with MS and of course they said "no one else is reporting this, must be a Dell issue." Rinse/Repeat a few times as I've been getting more and more frustrated. Sometimes it even happens not during the patch week but we always just assumed those are the stragglers who never reboot.

 Does anyone have suggestions on things to try? Are there alternatives to Bitlocker people are using? We're a State agency so all portable devices have to be encrypted. (and it's good practice anyway)

 I wrote a KQL query to check for ASR Rules being hit that are set to audited mode. Now if ido this KQL query in Advanced hunting I get no results. However i find it weird that with 610 devices there are no hits. Also i created a powershell today that should trigger a wmi event subscription but also no hit so far in Defender. How long does that take to sync? What am i doing wrong?
 Below is the code.
 DeviceEvents | where ActionType in ( 'AsrExecutableEmailContentAudited', 'AsrExecutableOfficeContentAudited', 'AsrAdobeReaderChildProcessAudited', 'AsrObfuscatedScriptAudited', 'AsrOfficeChildProcessAudited', 'AsrOfficeMacroWin32ApiCallsAudited', 'AsrOfficeProcessInjectionAudited', 'AsrPsexecWmiChildProcessAudited', 'AsrUntrustedExecutableAudited', 'AsrRansomwareAudited', 'AsrUntrustedUsbProcessAudited', 'AsrVulnerableSignedDriverAudited', 'AsrScriptExecutableDownloadAudited', 'AsrPersistenceThroughWmiAudited', 'AsrOfficeCommAppChildProcessAudited' ) | project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, AccountName, AccountDomain, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine | order by Timestamp desc 
 ​
 Powershell used on a test device under normal user no admin.
 ## Create a hit for WMI Event Subscription Create a test WMI event subscription $Query = "SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 5 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_LogicalDisk' AND TargetInstance.DeviceID = 'C:'" Register-WmiEvent -Query $Query -SourceIdentifier "TestWMIEvent" -Action { Write-Host "Test WMI event triggered" } 
 Unregister-Event -SourceIdentifier "TestWMIEvent"
 How do you guys test this?
 ​
 Small notice: If i change one of the asr rules to Blocked (we do have some rules also set to blocked) I DO get hits.

 I am currently in China doing a manual refresh of our University campus machines. As there is no back end infrastructure such as SCCM or AD (I know), we have been using USB sticks to build machines.
 Today we noticed that a lot of machines refused to boot from USB, despite the BIOS being configured to do so. It seemed like some sort of third-party bootloader was hijacking the boot process. 
 Upon inspection of a machine I noticed a strange PCIE card. Removing the card allowed a normal USB boot, and for our image to.be applied to the machine - and removed the weird bootloader.

 My question is: what is this device? Have you encountered or used one yourself? What are the security implications of this device?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit,
 I’m stumped on an issue. We’ve got a user account on the domain that should only be able to save to USB memory sticks, not able to save to their home drive or profile area (Desktop/Documents/Pictures/Videos/etc). I’ve got it sorted for their home drive but whatever I try they can still save to their profile area.
 I have tried applying Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> System Security -> File System. I’ve tried putting %UserProfile%\Desktop and just Desktop. In GPResult I can see the policy is being applied and that it’s saying Deny Full Control but I am still able to create new files in that area. We just want a message box to say error or permission denied, something so that they cannot leave it there and log off.
 Any help appreciated please. Thanks in advance.

I want to use a virtual machine in order to run virtual box , and think bare metal is the only option than dedicated. I've seen ones costing over $100, but I'm hoping for something under $50. Azure signup failed and working with support to resolve. I'm not worried much about performance just features only.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is planning on using ServiceNow and their CMDB. Obviously filling the asset database with computer system information, their software etc. needs to be automated.
 I've audited and played with their discovery methods. Either it requires WMI or, PSSession w/ admin privileges, or custom made JEA session configuration. Obviously I was more interested in Just Enough Administration. Their rule capabilities file allows just for one custom made function which creates a script block with any lines of code you pass to it and then executes it in a separate workspace thus acting as pure privilege escalation.
 Digging deeper I've added logging of each and every payload they send into that function and they send a couple of their own PS modules, binaries, dlls, and even C# code which they compile on the fly. Apart from that they use wmic.exe to name a few.
 Do any of you have experience with ServiceNow and their Discovery solution, and does anyone think it's not a reason to be concerned? Is it a common practice to grant systemwide access to such solutions via PowerShell+JEA or should it be considered a major security concern?

 I hope youre doin fine? 
 I have a very strange Problem. 
 I create GPO-rules for deleting shortcuts from desktop.
 If the shortcut ist on the users desktop, the command looks like:
 - %username%\Desktop\Google Chrome.lnk
 This works !!
 ​
 But when the shortcut is on the public desktop, the command should be like this:
 - C:\Users\Public\Desktop\AnyDesk MSI.lnk
 or
 - %public%\Public Desktop\AnyDesk MSI.lnk
 ​
 But when I write "gpupdate /force" in the command line, just the GPO for the users desktop works, public doesnt.
 ​
 I have also searched the internet and also followed step for step the video tutorials. No success...
 ​
 Do you know that it can be?
 ​
 Thanks and sorry for my bad english...
 ​
 Regards
 Volkan

 He's a people person.. I'm decidedly NOT a people person... I'm a techie who for the most part likes computers infinitely more than I like people. Now I have to manage the program I work on *AND* do the actual work.
 now I have to do peopley things and meetings and send out executive summaries and pretty powerpoints and FUCKING HATE IT.
 And of course, doing two jobs, for the same money, means I'm getting paid half as much as I used to be...
 So how about it? Anyone looking to hire a mid-50's bearded Unix/Storage engineer with 30 years experience who doesn't work and play well with others?

I have created a mapped drive that was placed on the desktop through group policy. In my infinite wisdom, I did not use item level targeting on the shortcut to select the security group that should be the only ones with access. Now, everyone has the shortcut on their desktop but only those in the security group can actually access it. I have updated the GPO shortcut to have the correct targeting. What is the best way to remove the shortcut from those who don’t have permissions in this scenario? Unfortunately, the drive is not mapped to the same letter for everyone. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

 I am currently in a position where we have to manage a site with no local IT, a severe language barrier as well as 12h of time shift.
 I am trying to find a solution where we could do troubleshooting remotely, in cases we need to access BIOS or troubleshoot an issue that occurs while booting. Basically, no access to the operating system.
 I am wondering if there is a device that would add a similar feature as a server remote viewing feature like a iDRAC on a server, that could be provided with USB-C. Ideally, a dongle with a network port that has an IP configured on it, that we could remote into and have a keyboard/mouse/monitor.
 Is there such a product that exist on the market?
 Open to other ideas.
 Thanks!

She said she had been working there for 2.5 decades, and had 2 managers telling her they don't do this. 
 Obviously there has to be a way I can get in touch with someone who can change my IP's rDNS, but IDK where to go. Is there a specific line or department that's known to be able to do this?

 I’m about to have an interview and my recruiter sent me an email saying to expect “fiber termination” questions from a panel 🫤. 
 I have not “terminated” fiber ever, have used a fusion splicer couple of times though. Is this a skill that all network engineers have? I’ve searched videos and it all seems somewhat basic, but requires good tools in the range of 2-3k. 
 Also, do you guys have tips and things I should know about fiber: IE - color coordination, troubleshooting, when to use specific connectors etc?? 
 Note that I do not intend to lie, rather show that I’m willing to pick this skill asap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Aware that SMF is yellow and MMF is orange / aqua (based on it's spec) and thats the primary reason for them being coloured so you can tell at a glance what you're dealing with.
 We operate a SMF only site, and with our copper estate we have different colour copper patch cables for different purposes and I started to think given we have a decent amount of fibre wouldn't it be good if we had the same colour options with our fibre (given we know it's SMF). E.g. red for spine to leaf, purple for external fibred APs etc.
 I've spoken to our fibre distribution partner who has suggested either velcro ties around bundles of cables or clips /labels which work to an extent but as with copper if you've got a big bundle of SMF, it can be very useful to identify a cable via its function.
 Draw backs as far as I can see:
  
cost of custom patch leads
 confusing the badgers out of anyone external who doesn't know about the colour schema.
 standards compliance
  
So the question! How do those of you that have masses of SMF manage fibre by function? Is coloured fibre patch leads absolutely crazy? 
 Thanks,
 NS

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This sounds kinds crazy as I type it, but the company I work for is looking for some kind of 3rd party help-desk to bolster our services. I'm familiar with 3rd party remote-hands like Indigo, but I have no experience with/knowledge of any types of companies that also supply outsourced helpdesk services.
 The problem is that the company I work for is a very small MSP operation with not enough staff to manage on-call work given the number of customers we have. The company is trying to hire more full time people (I myself am only there for a few months now) but we simply don't have enough for the workload. (Additional context: we're in Europe, not in the US, so the company can't just force full-time employees to do 24/7 on-call - which is great but exacerbates the coverage problem)
 If these kinds of 3rd party/contract help-desk companies exist, does anyone have any experience with dealing with them? How was it? Who should we avoid? How was access to network resources managed/controlled?

 I work in Canada and make $95kCAD salary per year in one of the most expensive cities.
 But whenever people from US talk about getting $140K+ USD with benefits for doing same or even lesser jobs, I get somewhat depressed and envious of others.
 And I can't even apply for any of those jobs in US for not having "green" card. I don't qualify for H1B1 for not having full bachelor's diploma. And I can't quit the job just to waste 4 years trying to finish up a degree in hopes of getting H1B1 sometime down the line.
 Does anyone else get Envy/depressed when people discuss their salary?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weird request I know. 
 I test PLC devices. I have a Dlink DGS-1210-10 switch specifically for the fact that it's fairly small, and I can configure MDI/MDIX manually through the web interface. This is a requirement for our testing, as we need to know it's our test device doing the AUTO part of MDI/MDIX or not. I also have a bunch of Stratix 5400's that'll do it, but they're huge beasts that don't fit in my backpack well. 
 The easy button is a cheap old hub with an uplink port. I get it. But I also need SNMP for some network scripting development in the future. I'm also hoping to include the MDI setting in that script.
 Do ya'll know of, or can look for, a switch with these manually-configurable options? I've spent hours trying to read webUI screenshots looking for these settings, since every company just advertises "Auto MDI, never worry about it again!" (Which is correct, but useless for me). 
 So, I need hands-on experience with a small, portable, configurable switch that has this weirdly specific option. I can buy another DGS1210, but there has to be more than one option out there. (also I hate the 120v plug for personal reasons, 5v/12v/24v preferred).

 This is a bass ackwards system that I just cannot get my brain to click with. I made a little progress, but I still don't understand how or why it works and I've been completely and totally lost with the errors that have popped up. (yes, I've googled until I was blue in the face) it's not that I don't WANT to do it, I really do, but I'm just wasting everyone's time. 
 'wasting everyone's time' - or should I just say fuck it, I said I can't do this, but it's the companies time to waste? Except I can't work like that. I need to feel like I've accomplished something and proud of my work. I've not been this lost since I was a kid and got lost trying upgrade from DOS 5 to 6.22.
 Edit: Thanks for the encouragement and tips. I feel a tiny bit less shitty about it now. I'm definitely going to check out macadmins.

 We leased out racks at two separate Cyxtera locations for redundancy purposes. We decided to have both locations under Cyxtera to make it easier for us to manage our equipment but perhaps, we should have leased one location from Cyxtera and another location from another provider.
 I'm not too sure how to proceed and wanted to see what others' opinions are. Do we stay and just assume another data center company will scoop up Cyxtera and business as usual for us? Or should we diversify and seek out another Toronto-based company? Of course, the latter is attractive, but it's going to cost the business more (time, money, etc). I don't want to create unnecessary work for my team if this bankruptcy is going to have minimal impact. My hope is that another company scoops up Cyxtera; maybe they will change the portal for end-users, with little change here or there but nothing dramatic such as shutting down facilities, forcing us to scramble to find a new co-lo.
 For some context, we run the majority of our applications on-premise (mail, DB, in-house developed back-end apps, etc). Cloud would be too expensive for us. 
 Like I said, looking for other pragmatic opinions. Maybe even some recommendation for co-location providers in the Toronto area (we're based in Mississauga)?
 EDIT: I may have not been clear. My business is a customer of Cyxtera. I do not work for Cyxtera.

 Why is Windows' DHCP client not working like I'd expect?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

 I'm not convinced this is the correct community, but I'll give it a try. (Please guide me if not).
 I'm doing IT for a small nonprofit organization. The organization supports families that have medical circumstances. The goal of this organization is to guide the family with accurate referrals and recommendations without any side interests.
 The "client" seeking information is usually anonymous. Up to this point the information is gathered and stored in a large spreadsheet shared with the team. The information is split up into multiple sheets which have multiple tables for services contact info on each plus additional information.
 This isn't idle for data entry or for search and retrieval, as well as being too fragile for mistakes.
 I'm looking to move them to a robust system that is fit for this kind of entry and retrieval. I was looking into a CRM like Salesforce, this isn't a common use case for it, I'm wondering if this can work. Or is there a better solution?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working on this strange issue for a client for a while now and wanted to share with everyone since I beleve it will be resolved "soon". The client is trying to access godaddy.com from an Azure remote desktop server and was getting a 403 when accessing the site with this message: 
 Access Denied
 You don't have permission to access "http://www.godaddy.com/" on this server.
 Reference #18.d86bdc17.1687370848.137d991 
 I'll spare you the troubleshooting steps as I have been back and forth with Azure's support team and GoDaddy's chat support. While troublehsooting, I found this thread on GoDaddy's communicty page that was relivitly new reporting the same behavior i was seeing: 
 https://community.godaddy.com/s/question/0D58W0000ApjDChSQM/access-denied 
 I brought this to GoDaddy and Azure support's attention and found that the root cause is more than likely a large block of Microsoft's Azure IPs being blocked by an Akamai (Godaddy's Host) WAF. Azure support states they have a ticket open internally and will work directly with GoDaddy/Aakamai to resolve this issue. 
 This is the work around proposed by Azure's support if anyone is interested:
  
Leverage BYOIP(Custom IP address prefix (BYOIP) - Azure Virtual Network | Microsoft Learn) à Still needs testing ---- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/custom-ip-address-prefix
 Route Internet Traffic to On-Premise and leverage On-Premise ISP.
  
I'll update this post once resolved. Hope this helps.

 Long story short, I'm auditing a small/medium size business' domain for shortcomings with best practices/patching. This domain has their DC, File Server, and Exchange server (all WS2016/Ex16) and all of them have SMB 1 enabled.
 I don't want to break anything so I'm taking a slow approach to the removal. I first plan to run 
 Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB1Protocol $false 
 And probably let that stay off for a week or so for the "scream test".
 But I'm curious as to what Windows Admin Center is doing with their built-in SMB 1 Removal, and Audit SMB 1 connections. The (?) box states:
 **View and take action to remove the insecure SMB 1 protocol 
 But no where in the documentation can I find where this information gets collected and stored to "view". 
 Another option that I have no idea how it works or what it's doing is:
 Audit SMB 1 connections 
 There is nothing (so far) logged in Event Viewer on the WAC host
 Microsoft-ServerManagementExperience 
 This is a screenshot from the WAC webui showing the File Shares (SMB server) settings where this option is kept:
 Windows Admin Center - Settings - File shares (SMB server) Screenshot
 Does anyone here have any experience with using this feature/setting? If so, could you help shine some light on how it works and what it is/isn't doing for SMBv1 Servers/Clients. TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning,
 Looking for a little input here on a weird situation I'm experiencing across a few different computers/DCs/Domains/Users
 PCs are all Windows 10 Pro on 22h2
 DCs are a mix but nothing older than 2016. Fully updated. (I know its not current.)
 My GPOs are the same across the board:Enforce Password History: 2 passwords rememberedMax Password Age: 180 DaysMin Password Age: 1 dayMin Length: 6 CharactersComplexity Requirements: EnabledI also have it reference a "banned password list" so they cant use general words.
 When an AD users password expires and they go to log into their PC they are prompted to change like normal. Enter current password, new password and confirmation of new password.
 They click the change password button and after a few seconds it comes back with "Unable to change password"
 They ARE meeting complexity requirements (I went as far as using the domain administrator password as a test. Among other passwords.)
 If we cancel the password change screen, select "Other User" and type in their username and password there they are prompted to change the password. Same screen. Current password, new password and confirmation of new password.
 However, this screen works.
 Now normally this work around would be fine unless you report to a boss like mine who sees this as an issue.
 Has anyone experienced a situation similar to this? I confirmed none of the DCs have KB50115(I forget the last two digits i apologize. Its been a morning.)
 Thanks Everyone :)
 ​
 EDIT: I have also attempted to reboot the machines to kill the active "session" on the local PC and the issue is still present.

 Why I should use a dedicated Forward proxy for SSL DPI rather than using the firewall which has the same capability? 
 What advantages will I have by doing it on the proxy rather than on the firewall? or the firewalls (when sized correctly) are more than capable of handling the SSL DPI requirements in today's world.

 Literally every 2nd action I try do on the UI throws an error like "Oops, that failed", "That's like totally invalid", "Not serializable, bruv." -- Elaborate a bit? "Noooooo."
 This is the second tenant Ive tried to set up. I've abandoned the previous one after failing to rename the domain name of sharepoint with zero clue on how to move forward. (Google, Bing chat, ChatGPT had no clue either) -- lol I couldn't even delete this tenant, because even that has failed on multiple points.
 Now for the new organization MFA is just not working. The authenticator just scans it then nothing, not even an error message.
 How can so many companies use this garbage? I'm not a sysadmin, but I'm a pretty technical person (swe) and I can't fuckin believe I'm the only one failing at this shit.

 Hey everyone,
 I've been encountering a frustrating issue while attempting an in-place upgrade from Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter or Standard to versions 2016, 2019, or 2022. Despite various attempts, every upgrade attempt ends in failure with the following error message in the setupact log:
 2023-07-31 11:51:07, Error MOUPG CSetupManager::Execute(304): Result = 0x800705222023-07-31 11:51:07, Error MOUPG CSetupHost::Execute(463): Result = 0x80070522
 I've taken a number of troubleshooting steps, including trying the upgrade on multiple servers, removing them from the domain, utilizing local admin privileges, disabling UAC, and even temporarily uninstalling antivirus software. Unfortunately, all these efforts have led to the same persistent error.
 Has anyone in the community encountered a similar issue before or perhaps has insights into resolving this error? Your assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

 I'm reaching out for some guidance on a Microsoft 365 and Mimecast configuration challenge that I'm currently tackling as a new member of my company. My boss has entrusted me with the task of setting up internal signatures for all of our users, and while I've got the hang of external signatures, our CEO is keen on having the same functionality for internal communications.
 Now, here's where I could use your expertise: How can we go about achieving seamless internal signatures with Mimecast, mirroring the effectiveness of our external signatures? As far as I know, our external signatures are managed through Mimecast rather than Microsoft 365. Could we potentially explore the option of utilizing an additional third-party tool to streamline internal signatures?
 Your insights and recommendations would be immensely appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So....We recently changed our supplier for Single mode 30km 100mb SFP, and when my client received it, they noticed the TX power is now -4.4 dBm, but the ones they purchased before is -11dbm which is within the range on our datasheet -15~-8dBm. Our team overlooked the difference in Tx power, and I need to to damage control with my client.
 1.Could any experts on SFP give me the correct the formula to calculate the link budget for these 2 SFP modules? I want to check if the calculations could pass if I say we used Single mode 60km 100mb SFP.
 Our supplier told me Link Budget= Min Tx power - sensitivity 
 What I found online was Link Budget= Tx avg power- total loss+receiver sensitivity
  
Also is it Link Budget divide by 0.4 to get the maximum distance?
  
Wave Length 1310nm, Single mode 30km 100mb SFP
  
  Average Output Power Sensitivity Extinction Ratio PA-PD PA-PD 
  
 SFP1 -5~0 dBm -32 dBm 10  0.5 
  SFP2 -15~-8dBm -32 dBm 8.2 1.0  
 
 I wanted to post pictures of specs but couldn't.
  
What are the concerns for having a higher Tx power on the SFP? Signal Quality? Power Budget？Compatibility？Is there a way to turn this around as an upgrade?
  
I'm a rookie network product salesman and help would be greatly appreciated. Japanese clients are super sensitive to change without notice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone
 I was having a discussion with my colleague today about the AC Power Delay for a server.
 In a scenario where a company loses power and the UPS powers off the devices, I think that adding a 2-3 minute delay on the Power On would be good in case the electricty goes away again and again. Maybe it's rare, but I think it's better safe than sorry and we only lose 2 minutes. On the other hand my colleague was thinking about the fact that we work remotely and adding delay time may lead to thoughts like "it's broken/it won't power on" etc. and more downtime for the customer.
 What are your thoughts? I couldn't find best practices about this and I was wondering if everyone just keeps it at 0 and risk it to avoid losing time

 I'm looking for some advice on selecting ODFs for a networking project inside a building. There are a wide variety of ODFs available, with different coupler types, pigtail types, slot counts, and densities.
 I have two questions about choosing ODFs and fiber optic cables.
 ​
  
If I choose a 1U ODF with 48 slots, I can only use 48 links if I choose SC couplers, but I can use 96 links if I choose LC couplers. In real life, most people here in my country choose SC couplers, which makes me wonder why. Is there a benefit to using SC couplers that I'm not aware of?
 We have two 72-core fiber optic cables, for a total of 144 cores. Should we use a single cable with 72 cores, or is it better to use two cables, one with 48 cores and one with 24 cores? I got one recommendation from cable supplier that we should go with two cables
 I need some input from experts here as designing L1 is very important and a bad design could make our lives hell.
  
Thanks in advance for your help!

 The question I have is would it be a bad idea to install the management tools on a DC? Ordinarily, I would never consider installing anything other than AD roles on a DC but am thinking because the purpose of the tools is to administer AD attributes, this might be ok?
 The only requirement I can find is domain-joined Windows machine

 It doesn't actually do anything, it's not searching or finding any updates, We use SCCM for patching, so wondering if that is overwriting some settings.
 ​
 Policies enabled:
 Configure Automatic Updates (3 - Auto download and notify for install)
 Allow signed updates from an intranet Microsoft update service location
 Automatic Updates detection frequency (every hour)
 ​
 I can see on the Windows Update settings page it now says *We'll automatically download and install updates, except on metered connections (where charges may apply). In that case, we'll automatically download only those updates required to keep Windows running smoohtly.
 ​
 If I click the 'Check for updates' button, it finds and downloads/installs any updates completely fine.
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas?

 I'm on linux so the official media creation tool won't work.

I was wanting to know what strategy you have found to best re-cable a rack. Do you do one cable at a time from a network port to a switch? Or write down the ports that are used and plug all cables from the rack and start fresh? Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so pre explanation of the file that is needed to be accessed. The file is a quickbooks file which will be opened by pcs on both sides of the network. The file is active and so it constantly updating and being shared around the network. 
 The way this was working initially was we had a NAS that hosted the file. Everyone would access the Nas and no file would be sorted on any of the pc’s. Recently we opened a branch in another country and so after talking to some network engineer from there he told us to get the MX68 for both sides of the network and to set up a site to site vpn to allow access for the other branch to the NAS and therefore allowing them to use the file as if they were in office.
 The struggle I’m having is the file will open here but not in the other branch. The latency of the vpn is +100ms. The internet speeds are a little affected and the ipsec policy apparently dosnt exist for this setup so we can’t see any computers on the other network. 
 I think that the vpn is set up incorrectly but I’m not sure because I thought hiring a professional would not bring me this problem. 
 Is this really a limitation of hardware or incompetent network engineer

 At the ends of my limit right now.
 We have 4 customers that have ended up with their domain on the Spamhaus DBL blocklist, and so all their email is getting sent to junk and getting filtered by mail filtering.
 I have absolutely no idea how this has happened and Spamhaus aren't really too quick to wanting to remove it. I looked in the email headers and it seems the addresses that the emails come from (365 ones) for example 52.100.164.231 are on blacklists as well. Is this what is causing it?
 These customers are using HornetSecurity for email filtering, have they gone and messed something up? If i look up the domain in MXToolBox this is the list reasoning Reason for listing - No IP queries, see https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/Spamhaus%20DBL#279 but it isn't exactly forthcoming with information. Any help with this would be appreciated greatly as I have tried everything I can think of.

The new DC is already added to the environment, DNS and everything is setup and working. I'm not in a rush so I wanted to have both for a while until I am ready to migrate FSMO and then decommission the old DC.
 The AD environment still is heavily peppered with remnants of its origin in a 2003 SBS environment back when they had Exchange on-prem so there are GPOs and SG and all sorts of fun I'd never seen before. I thought I'd clean up some stuff in ADUC as it is not needed and the ADUC structure has OUs with no tiered structure and I'm moving everything around during this migration. I wish it were easy to just start over with a new clean Domain but it would be too much work as there's no RMM solution on the endpoints...
 TL;DR: I was cleaning up folders in ADUC and I deleted the "Managed Service Accounts" container... No backups, no snapshots... :( There was nothing in the folder which is why I deleted it before even thinking about it... How do I get it back? I found some guides and docs online that suggest the process is to use ADSI Edit to change some env variable in the domain then run AD prep from the OS install disk... I don't have the 2012 R2 ISO, only the 2022 install ISO. Is this the right method and/or does anyone have first-hand experience with this... or just other suggestions for the mess as I've described it.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I started a job at x-company and I was given a ticket about requesting some devices back from a few employees. Well, several months went by and a lot of requests were sent to get these devices back. One of them actually quit a few weeks ago and never turned in her laptop. I made every effort to get it back from her, including involving her supervisor - then also that person's supervisor. No results ever came of it. My supervisor and even the CIO know that this person took off from the company with one of our laptops with zero communication about whether they were going to return it. Now, my supervisor, the CIO and the main IT guy at our location is telling me I need to call her on her personal cell phone to ask for it back. My thing is, she wasn't giving the damn thing back when she worked here, she isn't going to give it back now. I also feel like this should be an HR issue at this point - not a person who is basically just help desk. What do I do? How do I tell the CIO and IT director I am not doing this because it's not my problem at this point?
 TLDR; ex employee still has a company laptop and everyone wants me to call and harass them for it back.
 edit : I'm going to have a chat with legal and HR tomorrow, thanks everyone for your helpful answers!

 When I search for someone that is not in our company by email I don't get the Search externally option. When someone I worked with searched they did; looking at our accounts in teams admin center they look like they have the same settings.
 
 I have 
 uninstalled/reinstalled team
 Cleared teams cache
 Tested on a different system with my account (not working)
 Tested new account (which works) on my system and another system
 Removed E3 license/Added it back
 
 So far none of this works my account is old before we moved to O365
 We also used to use Skype for business.
 Maybe a weird leftover setting in my attributes? Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/networking,
 I've read through the documents regarding the design of cables to be used inside the building, and I understand that it's best to use multi-mode fiber optic cable. If we need to connect to a building miles away, we need to use single-mode fiber optic cable.
 I understand the part about using multi-mode fiber optic cable inside the building, and I also understand the part about using single-mode fiber optic cable if we run it outside the building and connect to a faraway building.
 The part that confuses me is the part about interconnecting from the outside building to the inside building using the ODF or termination box. If I'm not mistaken, it's not possible to connect a single-mode fiber optic cable to a multi-mode fiber optic cable, because the core of a single-mode cable is 9 microns and the core of a multi-mode OM2 cable is 50 microns.
 Right now, I'm not sure what to do, because I have two suppliers: one from a telecommunications company and one from a cable company.
 - The telecommunications guy suggested that we use single-mode cable inside the building and multi-mode cable inside the data center. I agreed with him, because if we need to connect sites over a long distance, we'll need to use single-mode cable from the outside to the inside.
 - The cable guy suggested using multi-mode cable throughout the building, but he didn't give me a clear explanation of how we would connect the outside to the inside.
 So, what is the right design? Thanks for any input.
 ​
 ​
 Solution: Single mode is the right decision.

 However...I know if you tag the management VLAN as well, you can still get to the IP of the switch without a problem. 
 Is there any performance or security purpose behind untagging your network device management IP? Is it less safe to leave it tagged even though the management IP would still be accessible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have installed a cloud router switch, which is the first Mikrotik device/router I am configuring and on top of that, I am not a network engineer with my only experience coming from homelabbing. Basically, I had the smart idea of colocating some of my equipment in a datacenter which is what I am using the CRS for. My colo provider provided me with a /27 set of ips. In the quick config, I gave the router a IP address which works (I am able to ping and access it, and I am using wireguard). I have a hypervisor that I will be creating VMs in. The hypervisor allows me to enter a pool of IPs to use so it could automatically assign a static IP from that pool to a server (also I need to give the hypervisor an IP as well). I am basically stumped on how to assign (or rather make available) a pool of IPs to the hypervisor that is connected directly to the router. The router seems to have picked up the IP I defined just fine. I tried doing a DHCP server using the pool of static IPs on an older config and when installing ubuntu server on one of my servers, it seemed to have pulled an IP and get internet as it asked to update the installer but I since have cleared that config as I ran into issues, and that I don’t think I want to do DHCP but I want the server to be able to use the addresses for manual assignment. Any ideas on how to accomplish this? Would it be just a question of making sure the configuration on the device side is right?Also all of my LAN ports are on a bridge (aside from the WAN port).
 Any help would be appreciated, thanks!.

If I have a family, we're going to struggle. (Look at Canadian real estate prices, particularly in Vancouver. A partner making the same as me wouldn't even be enough combined income for a one-bedroom condo.)
 Big picture life plan: I'd like the option of getting a TN-1 visa and going to the States, but my lack of diploma/degree in a related field means I wouldn't meet the educational requirements—plus lack of education makes me less marketable to US employers. So I'm looking at getting a diploma or maybe even degree online (TRU most likely). It would need to be online/flexible as I need to keep my day job. I couldn't afford to exist on student loans alone in today's Canadian rental market.
 Question: should I just completely forget about learning anything from Udemy courses (some of which I really like the look of), or could that realistically fill gaps that a formal education wouldn't?

 I work at my family's business, and we have had a single IT person (I'll call him John) in the entire history of the company. John has been with the company for over 40 years, started out as a musician, and learned about IT along the way. 
 Since John started as one of my father's first few employees (before we had computers), our headcount has grown, we are spread across a few facilities, user needs have changed, and there's more technology than ever. To keep things short, John has not kept up with the times and best practices; he has only recently upgraded his work machine to Windows 10, can barely join a VoIP-based meeting, and is unaware of most solutions that could help make his job easier. I had to gently push John to turn on 2FA for his email account.
 I don't want to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yeah yeah, ransomware attack, we're good, minimal damage, functional for business in two days, is what it is, hopefully the worst is over and it's all good, still on edge and vigilant but better spot than we were at the end of last week. 
 What's interesting to me is that for one of the workstations we have, OneDrive absolutely did not behave as expected. The end user's machine was encrypted, fine, we'll do a OneDrive reset to the previous day. Or roll back the versions on the important files. When I started doing that, I noticed something terrifying: every version was encrypted. The original version might have been three years old, I restore it, encryption. I check the restore option, just gonna reset the whole thing. Before I do, I start looking at the files in the restore. The encryption was present throughout, weeks before the event occurred. 
 Okay, maybe it's been on this PC for a while, patient zero, etc. So I go check our third party backups for 0365. Clean as a whistle. No sign of any encryption at all on the same files for the same date that the OneDrive reset is showing as bad. 
 Called in a few outside resources to look at it, and they flipped. Have some pending reach out to some resources to better understand, mostly just making this post since I know a lot of people use OneDrive, don't trust Microsoft's verbiage of only the latest version can be affected by ransomware, appears to be patently false as of now (which I feel we all kind of expected but still).

I am over in a rural area, with little exposure to new equipment, practices, and people/education. I sometimes am a sysadmin, sometimes a server admin, sometimes cloud admin, but everytime I am the guy getting calls for "support". 
 More recently I was wooed by a company to come and learn BAS controls and so off I went. Now I am doing admin work, desktop support work, controls design/engineering/install/support. Still have customers calling me for gates, door control and IP cameras.
 Maybe at one point I could keep up, but talk about master of none. 
 I guess I am here asking a few questions; I feel so burned out trying to keep up with the tech changes in each of these fields. What the hell do I do here?
 Part of me is wanting to give up all tech, but my fear of being irrelevant and not making money is everything. 
 I gave up being 100% independent to work for a company, and that company is mainly controls. Controls is okay, being a subcontractor of other subcontractors sort of sucks though, it's like we are just always pushed around, schedule wise, etc. 
 Anyway, there anything any of you could offer up? Let er rip. Roast me even. 
 Thanks

Staff Network - 802.1x with Radius via username and password
 Managed Student Device Network (Chromebooks, Promethean boards, iPads, etc) - WPA2 PSK
 Public - Isolated network with guest sponsor required to logon.
 Windows 2016 NPS server.
  
What I'm trying to do is move the managed student device network off of any sort of PSK. I'm having a hilariously hard time trying to find solid documentation on how to do any sort of certificate based authentication for those devices.
 From what my pea sized brain understands so far, I need to have a CA server (which I have) to generate a certificate with, push the certificate out to our devices via our MDM, etc. I'm just unclear on how to connect all of that together. I want to ensure that only devices that have our cert on them are able to connect to the managed student device network.
 Thanks so much for your help. If I can expound upon anything to make it more clear please let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears route dampening recommendations have changed a lot with the most recent one being ripe-580. Configuring a maximum suppression threshold of 50,000 and a suppress threshold of 6000 is what's currently advised. The prior recommendation (ripe-378) was to disable (or not enable) route dampening at all because it potentially cause more harm than good. 
 Is route dampening enabled in your organization. If so, what values have you settled on?

 The other employees (they are sysadmins too) really became jealous suddenly and so my boss said the first and best thing to do is to fire me.
 I don’t understand anything anymore and it wouldn’t be a problem but my wife is pregnant (9th month) and the baby can be on his way at any moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Reading tailscale's documentation about how they allow peer to peer connection through UDP hole punching, there is something I don't understand : tailscale uses wireguard, so the server to which we want to connect needs to listen on a certain port. Let's say the client wants to connect to the server, but the server is behind a NAT, with no port forwarding. Then, tailscale uses STUN servers, and with the ip + port information, can do UDP hole punching to let the client connect to the server behind the firewall. However, this peer to peer connection only works on this particular random port, and doesn't connect the client to the listening wireguard port ? One solution would be that they use iptables which redirects the higher ports to the wireguard ports, but I don't think that it's the case because it seems really impractical...
 How do they manage to do this ? Is there something I don't understand ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Quick question regarding IGMP queriers as I can't find a good answer online;
 My understanding is that all multicast traffic is forwarded to the querier, so let's say we have one switch (A) with a load of sources and receivers and another switch (B) which is the querier which has its own set of sources and receivers, these two switches are connected. Even if the receivers on switch A are only wanting to receive the sources on the same switch, all the sources are still gonna be sending a copy of their traffic to Switch B, the querier, correct?
 If that's the case, won't that mean the link between switch A and switch B is gonna be completely congested and dropping packets?
 Or do the sources on switch A just send reports to the querier on switch B so it's not forwarding the full multicast traffic to the querier unless there's a receiver on switch B that sends a join?
 ​
 Many thanks

 I think the hardware I should be looking at is from Peplink or Cradlepoint - but I'm looking for someone to walk me to the actual answer than doing this a la carte.
 I need to be able to push data uploads towards .5TB to 1TB inside 24 hour period (regularly) while mobile. 
 This situation is where getting 500GB there in under 12 hours is a significant advantage over Fedex. 
 I figure that an upload speed (of 300-500Mb/s would be ideal)- and I guess I will need a combination of different carriers to get (ideally) near maximum US coverage. 
 Knowing that LTE is often spotty (and towards 10Mb or less.) Maybe having someone drive to a (close) 5G connective spot would make sense.

 Considering that the people I’m working with are just acting as a shopping cart between me and the manufacturer I truly don’t know why they think I owe them something. Over the past 10 years I’ve gotten such truly bad advice from them I have no idea why they think I owe them anything or what value they think they bring to the table.
 I needed a firewall, I got a quote, said wow, that’s BS! Made two more phone calls and found that CDW wanted 30% more from me than others did. On their best day they don’t bring 30% more value to the table. I also don’t let companies bid against each other, I get the best price and I go for it, I have no need to beat someone down further; I want companies to make money I just don’t want to be raped.
 So a few months later they found out that I didn’t buy the firewall from them, and just like any scammer they get REALLY mad when their mark gets away. So they retaliate the best way they can which is not to renew my subscriptions on time; not an issue, the subscriptions have also been removed from their company now too.
 I know it’s not the company instead it’s the shitty employee but that company promotes that type of behaviour.
 I truly have no idea what actual benefit CDW and the likes being to the table. I get more benefit out of Amazon just not making me speak to someone to place a freaking order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started as a general software developer / IT guy at a new non-profit. My job? To make it so *Thomas (*well call him) can retire if he so chooses. The problem is that he has custom-built 80% of our systems in PHP Laravel and has never written a trace of documentation.
 Any thoughts or ideas on how to best document what he has done so that both Thomas and I could leave and a new guy could come in and pick up what we left?
 The things I have done is make spreadsheets of servers, databases, hostnames, domains, and their renewal times, but what I have struggled more with is things such as our finance process, and how he has designed the whole process from the ground up to be tied with old software. Some of this is really easy high level documentation (servers and databases) other parts are really detailed and minute and I'm not sure how to handle this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to figure out how two data centers (mostly in different geographical areas) can be connected. These will have various machines which should be able to connect to each other at Layer 3. Let's say DC1 has subnet1 and DC2 has subnet2, machines from these subnets should be able to talk to each other. 
 After spending some time I got to know about MPLS, and a couple of more things like ACI, VPLS, etc., out of which VXLAN EVPN made sense and that's what I want to use. But reading more about it, I got confused further. I have read these:
  
https://yves-louis.com/DCI/?p=1588
 https://nuagenetworks.github.io/2017/09/17/MultiDC-Networking.html
  
Few articles say I need some connectivity at L3 to be able to do VXLAN EVPN. 
  
What are the options to implement this? 
 Do I need any special connectivity between two DCs? Or the communication can happen via public Internet?
 Is there any specific hardware I need to work as BGW or a machine with Open vSwitch will do? 
 If eBGP is required, then I also need to get ASN I guess? Will this be same for two DCs?
  
I'm new (noob to be honest) to DC networking so I might have wrong assumptions, also any pointers to articles, white papers, or any help is appreciated.

 During the weekend I changed the access points from DrayTek to Ubiquiti and didn’t have any issues until this morning.
 It seems to be constantly disconnecting and losing access to the internal network. One office has a VLAN which is working without any problems but everybody else is.
 The main problem is the door entry system which also isn’t working despite nothing being changed on their end. 
 I’ve tried everything (full reboot, plugging in only one switch at a time, changing the range but no luck)

 I have explained to him why I think it's doing this. I may be wrong about it, not sure as he's refused to even try it.
 This kind of behaviour is par for the course with him. Very little common sense, and always creating problems then dumping them on other people for them to deal with.
 Originally these jobs were scheduled on a production server, and for obvious reasons, this developer does not have direct access to production servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Morning,
 I am trying to find a way to work within my given parameters (read: budget) with the technology I already have. I apologize if this is all over the place. Thank you in advance!
 I have:
 Three Synology RS820+ NAS with 17.5 TB each (12, 12, 4, 4 in SHR format, 1 drive fault tolerance) that are at separate locations.
 All locations have 100 Mbps connections.
 We have 1 host with 5 Hyper-V VMs at one site, 1 host with 3 Hyper-V VMs at another site.
 (Side note: When I first got here, they were doing bare metal full backups of servers and trying to transfer them off site. Far too large but that is still in place. Need a better solution)
 I started using Veeam Community Edition to replicate 4 of the 5 VMs from one host to the other, file server being the one not replicating.
 Also using Veeam to backup the file server twice a day to one of the NAS devices (320 GB). We would like to have that data replicated to the other two NAS devices. This is part of the issue, I can't seem to come up with a strategy that doesn't involve trying to transfer 2+ TB daily (bare metals) over a 100 Mbps connect (~1.8 days).
 The question: Do I just continue to replicate these VMs and keep the data separate? Trying to accommodate a quick recovery without transferring too much data. By the time 2 TB transfers over 100 Mbps, it's 2 days old when it gets there. Doing that AND the 320 GB just clogs the pipes.
 TL;DR; How do I get 8 Hyper-V machines and 320 GB of daily file backups from two sites backed up most efficiently without moving huge bare metal backups over 100 Mbps pipes to all three locations. Yes, I know my title is a senior. Small company, titles are titles.

It looks to be on the client side as it is only happening on one user's computer in Outlook 2016. The emails are showing up in OWA, which lead me to believe it was possible a rule to was set up incorrectly.
 After checking the rules on the user's computer, I didn't find anything out of the normal. Since the user doesn't own the mailbox, checking safe senders or blocked senders isn't an option.
 I've tried repairing Outlook as well as removing and re-adding the shared mailbox but haven't had any luck. For now the user can use OWA as a workaround, which isn't ideal but it is what it is at the moment.
 Any assistance would be welcome.

 When running all validation tests, it fails (red) on 'validate cluster network configuration' step, with the rebuilt node as the issue. Other tests are good & warning states (as expected - stuff like VM's are off/no auto start)
 run JUST 'validate cluster network configuration' test on it's own... it passes; green! clearly no config issue. go back to running a full test and it'll fail.

When I started the account I bought the license through Microsoft directly, I never even knew what SYNNEX365 was until I saw it in this account and googled it. 
 Any idea how they would of showed up in my account as a reseller? Is this just some marketing agreement with Microsoft? Any idea how to get rid of them from my account? I deleted the tiles they had but can’t seem to get rid of them entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says I need to find a way to disable Windows Updates on a Windows 10 Pro PC and for some reason the PC of a customer still ran updates causing some chaos when it did.
 Online I only find how to pause them for 7 days or avoid them during business hours.
 We already asked some people an online and so far all I've got was the following
  
Stop and set service "Windows Update Medic Service" to disabled
 Stop and set service "Windows Update" to disabled
 Block Windows 11 Updates with 2 Registry Keys 
 Path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate
 Key 1: TargetReleaseVersion - Type: dword - Value: 00000001
 Key 2: TargetReleaseVersionInfo - Type: String - Value: 22H2
 
 Open the GPO Editor 
 Go to Computer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ Windows Updates
 Edit the Policy "Configure Automatic Updates"
 Set to "Enabled" and "2 - Notify for download and auto install"
 
  
The PC is used in an industrial setting and only needs an internet connection to let the technicians connect via Teamviewer QS if there are issues. Other than that it's running as a VM and the user is connected via RDP from a PC that is easy to replace if it breaks. This makes it easier for the customer to create backups of the VM when needed.
 To be honest I'm surprised the customer called during the afternoon and not during the morning as the VM rebooted during the weekend because of an Update and of course nobody checked / noticed until one of their industrial panels was blocking everything.
 Does anyone have any other idea on how to prevent windows updates? The customer refuses to use a WSUS and to be honest I am not very experienced with them either.
 Update:
 Each time someone clicks on the button Check for Updates, it's re-enabling the Windows Update Service. Is this supposed to happen? Shouldn't it stay disabled?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am looking for a solution to use for RDP for long distances.
 The distance is US-EMEA btw, so the latency is around 200-250ms.
 We have tested VPN with Microsofts RDP, which is fine but everything on the browser lags too much.
 And we were thinking of maybe something like guacamole or something similar maybe better?
 The absolute must haves are to be able to authenticate with Azure AD (Entra ID) .
 We did not went to the option of Citrix or Horizon because they require a substantial amount of setup and our use case is to server a couple of hundred users for specific apps.
 Any suggestions are welcome
 Thanks

 So I am working on moving over a Cisco 5500 series Lan Controller for a client to a 9105axi EWC. The wireless worked when they were using the 5500 but after the tier 3 tech built out the EWC it no longer works. It detects the APs but when you tag the traffic there is no longer any connectivity and a Wireshark capture shows that it cannot see the gateway.
 All routing is done through a layer 3 switch with SVI's. The trunks are allowing all vlans and the AP's switchports are in access mode due to using split mac architecture. I'm not sure if its how the WLANs are setup but I feel like it should just be working because all that changed was the type of WLC.
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

It is a must have for us so has anyone gone down this road without creating employee turnover or a bad relationship between IT and the rest of the business? Any advice helps!
 Edit with more info: Our company culture promotes creativity and freedom to make your own choice so the idea of an MDM clashes with those views. We do not have employees on company owned cellphones so the MDM would be rolled out to any phone with company apps/information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we are a small IT team for a mid size company. We get the occasional old laptop/workstation/server in our office. Normally we keep them and they get canabalized by other development teams. However now we get some old systems which are broken or not being used whatsoever or just plainly many old systems. We want to get rid of it but i am in doubt whether to 
  
physically destroy the drives (probably by a 3rd party with certificate since we do not have a lot of spare time to bother destroying it ourselves) 2.wipe them ourselves and donate/sell to our staff (but i am afraid of the work and "support" people might expect on the old machines).
 Only wipe them according to NIST SP 800-88 assurance certificate and get a certificate. This will be performed by an institution that will later donate the hardware to kids and schools.
  
I feel like going for option 1, since it gives me the least headache personally. However, i feel a little wastefull, there are probably a lot of people that will make comments ("i would have bought that"/"not good for the environment") when they discover everything was disposed of.. 
 We are not nessecarily a top secret data company, but of course there is some intellectual property and personal data on those drives.
 What do you personally do for your company, is wiping enough? Do you ever get comments about getting them destroyed, how do you deal with it.

 eg : https://ibb.co/w6Wn2TP
 Is there way I can do a virtual interface and then NAT ? Any advice!

 This issue is localised to just a few users
 These machines are hybrid joined so already just in a workgroup, most articles I've found online suggested putting into workgroup, rebooting then rejoining to domain but our machines aren't joined to a domain.
 Already tried flushing dns, stop starting etc etc.
 Any ideas?

 I want to venture into the field of networks/infrastructure, but I'm not quite sure about the roles or the knowledge I need to land a job. I have two years of experience as a frontend developer, and I did a little bit in backend and process automations. Lately, I've become interested in transitioning to networking or something related to infrastructure. I have several questions that I'd like to clarify:
 1) I understand that having the Cisco CCNA certification is a good idea for working in networks. Can you recommend any books or materials I can use for support? What topics do you consider the most important ones for me to know?
 2) I've seen a couple of job offers that require at least Ssr or Senior-level experience. Is there a path to enter as a trainee or at a more entry-level position?
 3) Is there a lot of programming involved in these types of jobs, or is it primarily about diagnosing, installing, and resolving communication problems?
 4) If you have any experience in this area, I'd appreciate it if you could share a bit about your experience and the position you hold.
 5) At the same time, I'd like to know if you're aware of other similar positions. For my part, I know the following (Networking Administrator, Sysadmin, Networking Technician, DevOps).
 6) When a job offer mentions "knowledge of Linux," what specific aspects of Linux are they referring to?
 7) What other skills do you find important to mention?

 As summary , if AD is not contactable then then PC's password will then be out of sync, resulting in computer account issues which may require a reset/rejoin to the domain. 
 Correct ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying to populate my Google Workspace directory with new badge numbers for both external entry (primary number in papercut) and internal doors (secondary number in papercut). I have the sync working as expected, but the cards aren't scanning in correctly when done at the MFP. I tried the hex2dec option, but while that looked better, it isn't matching the numbers.
 ​
 True, vanilla RFID scans:
 Internal: 2446487570 External: 0000982075
 Papercut Logged Numbers (dual frequency cards, so I'm not super sure which is which)
 1270D291 and 20000EFC3B
 Papercut logged numbers after hex2dec:
 137439935547 and 309383825
 ​
 I don't see a way to reprogram at the MFP, but I have tried to switch the "ID Card Read Type" setting to all of the options, which still results in having the same reads. I admit that I have no idea what the other read settings do, and I wasn't able to find them in any manuals.
 Here is a link to a screenshot of that config page.
 ​
 If anyone has any suggestions on how to go about figuring ot how these are encoded and/or how to get papercut to see the "true" scan that has been entered into Google, that would be excellent.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an SCCM admin and decided to pass arguments to msi files by using transforms. Unfortunately the Adobe Acrobat installer (setup.exe, which calls a msi file internally) always uses a locally cached MST file. I can overcome this by deleting the corresponding key under "HKLM\Software\Classes\Installer\Products\{GUID}" but of course this is not a suitable solution.
 I assume I read the whole TRANSFORMS documentation of MS but I can't find a way to tell the installer not to use a cached mst but the one in the installer directory instead.
 Changing the product code *could* be a solution, but I fear breaking other functionalities then. 
 Embedding the mst in the msi is also a possibility, but this would by my last resort.
 Any chance one of you have also faced this issue before and found a solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem after changing the speed of Host ESXi 6.5.X interface MGT
 Hi there, how are you doing, I hope it's going well.
 We have a situation where a change was made forcing the speed of the MGT interface, the management vnic, from the Web-Gui, html vware client, standalone esxi, we tried to force from 100MB to 1Gb to be in tune with the switch, but it did not work and lost access to the Host, at least it is a LAB host, non-productive environments. Despite forcing on the switch the speed from the switch, of the interface, that connects to the ESXI, the ESXI does not lift the network.
 Now the option we are considering is directly to the DC, with a laptop to connect from Ethernet to Ethernet, the ESXi card after the change was left in 1GB, and well most of the laptops today are 1GB.
 1.- So we are thinking of doing that, a direct connection and make the adjustment via the HTML interface.
 2.- Another one is to connect a keyboard and a screen and make the change from the yellow interface directly to the Esxi Host in DCUI, can you change from there?
 This server, this one from Lab, development. When it was installed, the interface, via esxi html web interface, does not give auto negotiation as an option, so I think this should only be configured via Esxi-shell, and set the interface to auto. Because from the web, it was only 10/100 and 1000, but not auto, From 100, I passed it to 1000 and then everything went to hell hehehe. The switch, its interface is in auto and the strange thing is that it only negotiated the connection at 100MBits, I feel that the network card of the server supports 1GB. That's why we changed it in the ESXi html to 1Gb and everything fell apart. 
 Thanks for the good vibes, the time and the collaboration.
 What other options, suggestions, advice, comments could you tell me.
 Thanks
 I remain attentive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a field tech. I'm constantly working in server rooms, on ladders, and running all over the place. I was wondering if any of you out there had any suggestions for a good headset or earbuds that you liked while working. I used to use those LG earbuds with the collar that goes around your neck, those were nice. I also have had a pair of aftershockz that were really cool because I could still hear my bridge call over server fans. I'm shopping for a new pair because one of my galaxy buds fell out of my ear into the "magic triangle", so propbably not another pair of those. They fell out all the time and needed constant readjusting. 
 I'm thinking of getting the newer aftershockz that are an "earbud with an over the ear hook". Maybe the ones with a boom mic. But I figure I'd ask some others in the field what they prefer. Maybe try something new. 
 Thanks in advance for your input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 10 years in the same company doing (helpdesk/desktop support role) , I was offered a position as an AV specialist, which is a ladder movement from my previous roles of helpdesk and desktop support. 
 The job entails working with vendors for installation of Crestron, Brightsign, Muxlabs, PA systems, wireless and wired mics, and boardroom setups with displays. 
 It also involves supporting VIP users and training desktop teams and end users on the use of equipment.
 I am uncertain if I have made the right choice as I do not have any experience in AV and have never worked with displays, Crestron, or MTR Team rooms. However, I am pleased to have the opportunity to move away from helpdesk calls. 
 I don’t do any of installation and going up ladder, but I do have to work with contractors. 
 AV specialist is still in IT field. 
 It is extra $5-10k a year more than when I used to make before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a network that is 100% Unifi gear. 10 switches, 80 APs, UNVR with about 30 cameras, and a USG-PRO-4. We want to replace the USG with a Check Point firewall. The problem is we have attempted this twice, and both times the network went haywire. We set us DHCP on windows servers, and set the relays on the VLAN interfaces on the Check Point, but clients could not get IPs. Clients with static IPs couldn’t really communicate on the network. Lots of dropped packets. Any connection we had would cut out after a couple minutes.
 We tried rebooting every switch and AP, forgetting the USG from the Unifi controller, set the Unifi networks to being VLANs on and using a third party router, and even split all the VLANs up as access ports connected between the switch and firewall. Also tried only having one switch powered on and connected to the firewall, but still had issues.
 I have worked with check point a lot, and have always had success connecting them to Aruba, Cisco, and Juniper switches. We want to replace the switches with next years budget, but for now this is what we have to work with. They only two things I can think of to try next are putting in a third party switch between the Check Point and Unifi switch, or wiping out the Unifi configurations and factory resetting everything thinking there might be a bad config somewhere. 
 Anyway, if anyone has replaced a USG with something else, or have any suggestions I would love to hear them.

Bouncing from project to project on a day to day basis and trying to keep your head straight has been hard recently but yesterday was actually very peaceful. 
 Yesterday, a shipment of RAM and SSDs came across my desk and I was tasked with installing the RAM and SSDs on a bunch of laptops. It was kind of peaceful in comeparison to the normal running around and trying to finish tasks in different projects all at once. Each laptop booted successfully, all the RAM was registered, and Windows didn't throw a fit when updating it. It was honestly refreshing to get some wins like this. 
 Mind you, I like the noisy and fast environment but sometimes working on something so simple like a laptop component upgrade is nice. Something where little can go wrong. 
 What are some of the tasks or jobs you like doing because they're simple and peaceful in comparison to the normal work?

I know AWS offers many services across databases, networking, storage, and more. Is there a specific service I should be focusing on? Do I need to know all services? For ex, database management services? Its a non-network related function, wouldn't this service be manged by DB admin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So.. recently have been tasked with designing a system setup for CCTV monitoring and other physical security applications.
 The kicker here is that our business that has approx 200+ locations have 7 or 8 different CCTV systems implemented (NUUO, Hik Vision, Dahua, UNV, Uniview and a couple of others).
 They (management) would like these all centralised on one physical machine they can access in person and stream live footage and playback/recordings as needed. 
 These old systems eat a chunk of RAM as standalones, let alone all running simultaneously.
 My rough plan is a dedicated link running into something like a rack mounted server and then having the permitted users authorised to RDP from a dedicated NUC or tiny PC to the server itself running the CCTV systems and other software. We do run a pretty decent security setup, Azure AD, 2FA and the rest of the nine yards.
 Am I way off base here? Any methods you would recommend to estimate the CPU and RAM requirements?

 Client has one account, lets call it ["shared.calendars@durp.com](mailto:"shared.calendars@durp.com)". This account holds all the org-wide shared calendars for all the depts, (Finance, IT, HR, etc...), and permissions are managed by the IT dept. So if accounting gets a new person, IT gets a ticket to add them to all the needed calendars.
 Not sure what drove them to configure things this way, but I can see both positive and negatives, with the biggest negative being that their small 3 person dept now sits squarely in charge of...calendars?
 I need some other folks perspective on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First question
 I understand that route based VPNs don't need them because of a routing table entry if destination = X use tunnel interface Y to send out pakets to destination, so there is a predefined route from source to destination.
 But why does policy based VPN need Proxy ID's and how are they exactly used? Would be nice if someone could explain it in a paket flow kind of way.
 ​
 Side question
 I've seen on some websites that you can configure Proxy ID's for route based VPN. What's the reason for that? Is it because of compability reasons like if the firewall or router on the other side can only use policy based VPN? This suggest that one side can use route based VPN and the other one policy based VPN and create a functioning tunnel.

 We have a windows terminal server thats causing no ends of issues over the last couple of weeks. The last 3 weekends have led us to rebooting it on a Saturday because it seems to be getting itself in a mess. Nothing I can see in the event viewer that stands out and looking after and maintaining servers has only started to become a main role for me. Is there anything that can be run like sfc /scannow on a windows server and is it worth investing the time to find the issue and fix the server over building a new VM and then making it live. Maybe investigating the issues at a later date.
 Is there any software that can really help us understand when servers are suffering issues and have an understanding of what is happening. I find event viewer to be exceptionally difficult to siphon through to find actual issues.
 I’ve enabled more logging in the last few weeks but this doesn’t seem to be helping me find the issue.
 We are a fairly large company with the ability to spin up VMs fairly quickly, and the TSV would have our main application on it then office on top for users to use. The TSV application links back to the application server where all the SQL is done.
 Edit 1: We have a farm and broker setup ready but supposedly there are issues with roaming profiles on these servers. I’ve had no interaction with this. 
 Also the server is the oldest of 4 we use and is given mainly to our manufacturing computers to access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently assessing my companies Git hosting method and what would be best for us. Right now we primarily use a local Git Tea server w/ Jenkins, but it currently has no dedicated resource to maintain it, and lacks a lot of features. We wouldn't be able to improve on this easily in the foreseeable future.
 I'd like to propose moving to GitHub Enterprise cloud with managed users, as it would be great for our IT ops team and would make a lot of our security easier (SAML, 2FA and can even choose data residency locale). I can probably sell it on cost, features etc. However, one of our teams writes SW for use on hardware in datacentres, and would push back against a cloud-hosted solution most likely due to issues with security compliance: essentially "we don't want our code on someone else's server". I understand this concern, but I find it poorly justified with our current solution.
 What I am looking for are potential EU & US policies, laws, standards etc. that I should be aware of that may apply to our scenario when it comes how we host our code. Would GitHub Enterprise cloud be more or less compliant? And how could I address potential concerns our SW team may have?

I’m fine using it as tear off, but I can’t figure out how to get the labels to be aligned so as to tear off at the cutter position instead of the typical tear off position (as if there was not a cutter attached). 
 Is there a setting to allow the printer to still be usable by tearing off without replacing the cutter? 
 If I can get the label to advance enough to tear at the perforations between the labels, how do I get it to then backfeed before printing so the label can be printed correctly using the full label?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dealing with a really odd issue I'm hoping someone has experience with...
 ​
 Currently running a Windows 2019 server as a VM within ESXI.
 ESXI is connected via 2 ethernet cables to a synology box which is acting as an iSCSI host.
 one ethernet cable goes directly from the ESXI server to the synology box (2.5gig 10.0.0.0/24 VLAN 1)
 second ethernet cables goes from the ESXI server to a switch (connected to the rest of my network) and the synology box is also connected directly to the same switch (1gig 192.168.0.0/24 VLAN 0)
 I have SMB3 Multichannel setup on the synology box which the Windows server uses for file storage (aswell as using the synology box for iSCSI).
 ​
 The multichannel generally works well - when I pull a file from the synology box I can see both the 1gig and 2.5gig are fully utilised.
 ​
 However once every (exactly) 10 minutes the multichannel fails, then a few seconds later comes back.
 ​
 I've determined it's happening due to this:
 https://imgur.com/SZROEJj
 ​
 Once every 10 minutes the windows server attempts to add the 192.168.0.253 -> 10.0.0.1 multipath.
 When it does this is disables the two paths:
 192.168.0.253 -> 192.168.0.251
 10.0.0.3 -> 10.0.0.1
 which drastically drops the speed for a couple seconds, then the 192.168.0.253 -> 10.0.0.1 channel fails, and then it resumes the good channels and everything goes back to normal.
 ​
 You can see the errors happening every 10 minutes exactly in event viewer:
 https://imgur.com/a/bZvKLfe
 ​
 The problem is I never set these channels, they are dynamically created.
 The 10.0.0.0/24 network is literally 1 cable going straight from the ESXI server into the back of the synology box on a seperate dedicated VLAN.
 ​
 I'm not sure how windows could "automatically detect" a route from 192.168.0.253 -> 10.0.0.1 when one of the cables is completely isolated?
 ​
 Not sure if this is an issue with the virtual switch in ESXI or something?
 ​
 Thanks for the help.

 I am not that good in networking, hence why I am asking here. 
 from where I come from almost every restaurant/bar have free wifi with captive portal, and I figured they (the company) were just getting the router and give it to the restaurant be done with it, 
 anyway I was thinking if I want to do something similar how would I implement such a thing but without the need of giving away router, 
 after my research and lots of googling, I understand in theory that I will somehow get the IP address of anyone who enters consider it untagged show captive portal (using redirect whether it is DNS or HTTP) then tag the ip once user click continue or whatever, then tag it and they enjoy the session. 
 so my question is not sure how to do the part of the somehow, I understand that I need to have DHCP server on cloud. and instead of giving away router I configure the already installed router to point to my DHCP server. 
 also was wondering how would I do such a thing on a big scale, say 100 restaurants/bars.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I'm not sure this is the right sub, but your advice is appreciated. I'm a sys admin at a manufacturing company, and as is often the case, wears many hats, including the in house programmer. I built an Employee Management application for the company that proved to be well adopted and successful. I kept getting comments that I should sell it and that other companies can benefit from that etc. I discussed this with the CEO, and he mentioned that he would have no problem signing whatever document is required to allow me to have full ownership of the app considering it was built mostly on company time. I never really considered this before, nor have any experience with monetization, but it would be nice to start my own thing and have something part time for some extra cash.
 Does any of you have any experience in where to start, where to go from here? I know I have to do the following, just not sure of the order: create a registered company, copyright the software, look into a business model (client hosted, cloud hosted, subscription based vs one time fee, etc.), create a front facing website for the company, advertise the software (how?, where?), figure out support, training... geez writing all this down is overwhelming, is this something worth pursuing?

I would obviously go in to inventory, document and look at invoicing to determine the scope of what the MSP has access to. How would I do this without alerting the MSP so they do not start to turtle and become more obstructive. I would need some sort of access to systems and accounts to unravel the depth and scale of their involvement. This company has zero in-house IT for 10 locations.

 Here is where it starting popping a bit in my mind to go somewhere else. Last year i had a 3 month depression phase (which is now ok today).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All!
 Upfront - I am a basic bitch when it comes to anything and everything sysadmin when it comes to things, so please grant me some grace as I ask you internet gods for some help.
 ​
 Current Setup (much of which I inherited)... I think I have them all listed.
 Domain: Hosted on Network Solutions
 Name Server: Wix
 Mail: Google
 ​
 On Monday, one of my employees noticed that he was able to send email but not receive it. We tried several tests, including me sending him emails from our domain as well as external emails to his email, no dice. Fast forward the story - turned out to be a company-wide issue where we were all able to send out from our email but not receive anything. Fast fast forward, it looks like our domain expired over the weekend. I immediately panicked and renewed the domain, and everything was restored within 24 hours.
 ​
 Now here is the rub... the emails that we sent to test, never came through. Is there any back-end settings or anything I can do to force emails that were sent last Friday to this past Monday to be delivered to its rightful place? Is there a holding area? I have no idea where to begin and would love some advice. I am worried we may have lost some emails from clients that came in during the "down" time and want to see what can be done.
 ​
 Thanks All!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an in-house mini-SCADA application running on a Windows Server 2016 Standard OS. It has a number of links to peripheral devices (controllers, Ethernet-to-serial gateways). Those links are primarily Modbus TCP or Modbus RTU-over-TCP.
 We have seen sporadic TCP connection dropouts every couple of weeks, i.e. connections to all external devices will be dropped and SCADA application will automatically reconnect. However, every time a number of alarms are raised in our SCADA application and logged in relevant log files.
 Initially I thought there is no pattern behind it, but I reviewed logs from the past couple of months and I can definitely see a patter, looks like the problem occurs every ~1193 hours...
 Extract from my SCADA logs:
 2022/11/18 11:12:13 - Windows boot time
 (might have been one occurrence in February, but SCADA logs have been overwritten so cannot check)
 2023/04/16 15:18:12 - connections in SCADA dropped, 2387.09h since boot, so roughly 2 x 1193h
 2023/06/05 08:22:59 - connections in SCADA dropped, 1193h since last occurrence
 2023/07/25 01:27:47 - connections in SCADA dropped, 1193h since last occurrence 
 I checked Windows Event log around that time but I could not find anything of interest in the main Application/System/Administrative logs.
 The only reference to 1193h that I could find on the internet is related to ancient Windows OS (https://ftp.zx.net.nz/pub/archive/ftp.microsoft.com/MISC/KB/en-us/136/935.HTM), so cannot imagine this still applies to Server 2016.
 So the questions is: has anyone ever come across a similar problem, i.e. a recurring network-related problem in Windows Server that occurs roughly every ~1193 hours?
 I may be just going insane, but if there is a pattern, there must be a cause!

We keep getting told from the app vendor that “the refresh will be included in the next release”. Four releases later we are spending too much time monthly remoting into these PCs and starting a Edge extension to refresh the page. Looking at VuePilot to better manage these displays.

 Please no rants on me mixing two techs or anything of the sorts, not looking to argue over opinions. I'm asking a simple question if anyone has done it, and how zfs and snapshots, and filesystems react to this.
 Short of doing it, and destroying the secondary pool to see what it does, which I might still do, I have no way of seeing how it reacts.

 I recently purchased a BX1200MI UPS from APC https://www.apc.com/shop/nl/en/products/APC-Back-UPS-1200VA-Tower-230V-6x-IEC-C13-outlets-AVR/P-BX1200MI
 However, when opening the box, to power the BX1200MI, I was expecting to receive a standard kettle lead with a 13A 3 Pin UK Plug like you would normally get for a desktop computer. However, instead I appear to have received an IEC C14 to C13 Power Lead https://imgur.com/TiFv6tB
 In the manual it states:
  
Please use incidental power cord in the package. 
  
However, I don't have a way of being able to get power from the wall using the C14 connector. So can I replace the cable with a standard kettle lead that has a 13A 3 Pin UK Plug or would that be a problem?
 Thanks for taking the time to read this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a lawyer and genuinely make an effort to fix my own problems and only ask serious questions when needing help. I fully understand that endless questions from someone who can barely switch a monitor on without assistance and should know better by now are infuriating, but at least half of the people who work in my firm are technically competent; yet IT seem to hate us all (not openly, but you can sense the contempt). 
 I’ve also caused bad blood with IT at work by pointing out security issues as well as problems with home built systems running slowly or glitchy. These problems are then fixed and clearly life is better for everyone, but IT clearly hate me for having raised them, and often won’t do anything until senior management have been roped in.
 There seems to be a holier than thou attitude and a feeling of ‘we’re really what makes this place run and you’re all idiots’ but at the end of the day, my emails, Word docs and MS teams calls are what pay their wages and what keeps the firm afloat. I also suspect that if computers were outlawed overnight, us lawyers would work out how to return to books, paper and typewriters very quickly.
 It seems to be purely an IT thing - I’ve never experienced this sort of attitude (to the same extent) from people who work in admin, accounts or any other function that is ancillary to the main business. My clients ask me tedious, repetitive questions, are occasionally rude and are often asking me to do hard, boring, often unnecessary (if they’d taken my earlier advice) mind numbing stuff I don’t really want to do, but I’m polite and obliging and never look down on any of them.
 FWIW, I’ve noticed this nearly everywhere I work and not just my current workplace. Although there is a very sizeable minority who aren’t, the majority of IT people seem to be like this including the friends I have outside of work who work in IT.

This is quite a mess and can cause issues. 
 We’re looking at a better setup with either 40 sites or multiple sites per location for different departments. 
 What is the best way to handle this? Ideally something that makes it easy to give access to new employees but would that require a group for each department in each location?

 Have a windows SBS 2011 domain controller(still using on-prem exchange) and a 2016 domain controller. 
 I went to upgrade FRS to DFSR and before hand I upgraded the domain function level from windows 2003 straight to windows 2012R2 on accident. 
 I copied the power shell command from a reference guide I was using and my remote connection solution sent the command after pasting it, it usually doesn’t do this but it did this time… so I was unable to change the command from using 2012R2 to 2008R2
 Then completed the sysvol migration successfully and verified replication succeeded. 
 How will this impact our domain/environment? 
 Please forgive me for as I have sinned

 I realize that even in cloud, networking is necessary and important. But I am trying to judge as to what the market is like, how much support is needed, and what everybody is working on.

 For those of you who are interested.
 Great course.
 Not affiliated in any way, direct all questions to the site.
 
 FAQ from same page.
 ​
 What is the format of the course?
 This course is a ten week email-course. Each week you will receive a lesson that contains a set of videos, some additional content, and some exercises. I will post solutions to the exercises online. The course is largely self-paced except for the weekly email cadence.
 ​
 Is there a lab environment?
 No, since this is a free course, there is no lab environment. For all of the lessons you should be able to accomplish the lessons without having any access to network devices.
 ​
 What are the prerequisites for the course?
 This course is intended for network engineers that have some basic familiarity with programming (for example, Perl, shell scripting, other language) and who would like to learn Python. The course covers Python fundamentals, but using examples and exercises that are more relevant to network engineers.
 ​
 Why Python?
 Python facilitates writing clean, readable code and is natively present on Linux and MacOS. Python has gained widespread support in the networking community both from engineers and from vendors. Python has a large, active community and, consequently, numerous resources are available to you (libraries, documentation, books, tutorials, etc.).

Just rejects my creds no matter what account I use.That brought me to the Security log where I have thousands of Event ID 5061 Audit Failures. They happen by the second. There are no active users. It's some process that is generating these events. The Security ID is always Network Service and the Account is always the SFB computer name. Computername$. Return code is always 0x80090016. I don't know if the Control Panel issue and this is related. I am lost and Googling just leads me in circles. I need a starting point to work from. I don't know if it's certificate related or what. Any advice would be appreciated. Just as an FYI, if I go into IIS and select the cscp directory, then select Browse 443, Control Panel opens up and passes my creds just fine. I also notice that if I try to login as a Skype user using a test workstation, Skype prompts for credentials which it shouldn't do, and won't accept the test users password. Clearly some kind of authentication issue. All certs for the 6 servers in this test environment, two DC's, two Exchange, and two SFB, have been issued by a local CA installed on the DC. I will say a few weeks ago I updated the CA to issue SHA256 certs. Other servers are not having an issue. DC's and Exchange running 2016. SFB 2015 running 2012 R2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My environment requires that I set only 1 ORG name at the top level due to how scan results get uploaded into the main database, they map to this org name in order to allow us to find our results and report them to management.
 Within this org though I have multiple subgroups all of which need scans done by this SC.
 User A and B belong in group X
 User C and D belong in group Y.
 Now before I had 3 Orgs:
 Main org that scanned everything and reported up
 Org X which allows users A and B to run their own scans
 Org Y which allowed user C and D to do the same.
 Users A and B should not be able to see or scan the assets of Org Y, or read the results. They should be isolated. And no one other then myself has permission to login and view the scan results of Main Org.
 However i'm being told that the higher ups now see scans coming in as "Main Org, Org Y and Org X" and can't map Y or X to anything and are getting confused.
 So it's working now as I would want it to, but because higher ups have a convoluted way of pulling the scans up to them (Don't get me started) they are telling me I can't have it setup this way
 Is there any way to possible setup assets so only certain users can see them or scan them? The roles allow a binary "Yes/No" to creating scans but I can't see anywhere that you can set up permissions on the assets themselves or within the roles

 I'm well aware of the reasons for fax's prevalence in the industry, and personally I would just continue eating the monthly cost of cloud faxing because it is secure, just works, and we don't have to twist our clients or employees arms to get them to change their workflow.

I am also close to getting a job offer doing systems administration for a very large company for a manager I don't know. Assuming pay and benefits are similar. Which would you choose?
 background, I have 16+ years in network/systems engineering. But I feel like I am hitting the pay cap for my skillset. Moving to the InfoSec position would be a lateral move for me, but allow me to develop a more specialized skill set. This will allow for even higher paying jobs in the future. I know pay isn't everything, but I figure if I spend a year or so trying out InfoSec, and I hate it, then I can get another job as a sysadmin. I also believe that it would be difficult for me to find an InfoSec position later that pays this well without direct experience.
 I am leaning towards taking the InfoSec position. What would you do? Is there something glaringly obvious that I missing as to why I shouldn't?

However I created a topology topology to practice ways of avoiding letting the edge router become a transit AS. One of the ways is to use the no-export community value. I was wondering is there any reason to use next-hop-self in this scenario? 
 Also, is there any reason to use send-community on the iBGP neighbor statements since no external routes should traverse them anyway? Thanks

 However... It wont let me select the correct account, it says it doesn't exist. 
 But can see other services running using the exact same account!
 Even if I do a 'Browse' it's not there (all objects/locations are ticked).
 I can even run a powershell command to list all service accounts and see the NTService\MSSQL$<name> account I need. I can also go to permissions on any folder and grant that account permissions.
 It's simply just not visible to add as a 'Log On' account for the server.

 I will give some background without giving myself away too much. We're a big manufacturing site working 24/7/365 in a global company. We have always been very involved in the industrial side since the 90's before my time when the factory started modernizing. Most factories IT or networking team only have knowledge about the personal computers and server networks from what I've heard and experienced first hand.

 We have a Ci$co 3850 stack and it seems sometimes stack active LAG members going to suspend state. IOS 16.3.5b This is happening on both Cisco and non-Cisco devices.
 Even i delete port channel or passive mode LACP, gives same log. LACP currently not enabled on the remote port I suspect it is related to stack switchover but not sure. After a reboot, it is fine, no port suspends
 Anybody here can give suggest about this? If i'm not alone, we can plan upgrade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have seen scenarios before where individuals have acquired an ASN and IP that they use for personal consumption. The though recently came back into my head when I recently saw a reddit comment regarding an individual who owned an IPv4 /24 and used a VPN to a VPS that supported BGP to advertise the block without needed an expensive DIA connection.
 I have seen several Local Internet Registry's (LIR) in the RIPE region that seem to offer ASN's with IPv6 PA addresses for fairly cheap but they seem to attach there BGP or VPS services for anybody outside of the RIPE region. I'm in the US so this unfortunately raises the costs and complicates the billing. I would love to have an IPv4 block but I would be happy with an IPv6 block and an ASN to experiment with. My plan would be to essentially tunnel all traffic from my LAN to an opensense or pfsense VPS and then peer to the VPS provider. Maybe complicate thing with VPS in different sites and using it to host public faced services.
 So now that my long winded explanation is out of the way, has anybody done something similar to this? How did you acquire your ASN and IP block(s) and what reputable services are out there to register with? From what I can tell ARIN is not too friendly with this idea and RIPE seems to be the easier region to acquire resources from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sooooo, I got a customer who’s managing about 200 servers with WSUS. For years they had one person who’s only purpose it was to update all those servers one by one. Some water down the river, I took this over and wanted to implement 2 new GPO’s. One which is automatically downloading but not installing Server updates, the other one which is downloading and installing updated on Sunday at around 2am. So basically it doesn’t sound like a big deal. Now it comes… All serves starting from server 2012R2 till 2022 are completely ignoring the GPO. I have no clue why. Set up the “configure auto updates” policy. Once this didn’t work, I tried my luck with “scheduled maintenance” and some kinda hacky things that I found on the internet. Still, no luck… Servers are rebooting at any day of the week at any time of the day. Figured that maybe another policy is conflicting with mine, but no. Created a test server and put it top level of the domain. Not a single policy other than the default domain policy (which is empty) and my WSUS policy is applied to the server. The behavior is still the same. Once updates get detected, they get installed about an hour later and schedule a reboot for another hour later…
 Guess I’ll turn off the WSUS synchronization or at the the availability for all servers till next Sunday night or till I found a solution…

My question is, would it be easier and cheaper to switch out the existing POTs connection with something else (voip, cellular) OR just get these lines going again? Needless to say all this would also have to meet safety standards.

Currently, we just add the devices' MAC into Active Directory and the NPS policy is a accept/deny then assign VLAN when accepted. Is it possible to have a catch all VLAN with NPS? For example, if the devices' MAC has an account in AD assign that device to the respective VLAN, but if a device joins and isn't in AD, then assign it to a catch all/isolated VLAN? This is more for as were provisioning devices since it's easier to find the right MAC from our DHCP server than the different settings on the device. I've tried a handful of different things and have had no luck. We have Unifi AP's and Switches and NPS running on Windows 2019.

 1) When i configure router 1 with :
  
ip nat inside source static 172.168.0.1 12.12.12.2
  
Why does router 1 loses all ability to ping other routers and hosts outside of his own LAN ? Is it because it will forward the ping reply to 172.168.0.1, hence not receiving it technically, so it can send packets just fine but won't be answered to ?
 2) Why can host 192.168.1.1 (the host on the top left) connect to the website hosted on 172.168.0.1 ?
 I have configured BOX INTERNET with :
  
ip nat inside source list NAT_VLAN1 interface f1/0 overload (having configured the NAT_VLAN1 access-list beforehand)
  
From what i understand, it means that the HTTP request will replace the IP of the sender by BOX INTERNET's f1/0's ip address (10.10.10.1). I haven't done any port forwarding in the other direction though, so how can 172.168.0.1 send an HTTP response to 192.168.1.1, when from what i gather the response should be addressed to 10.10.10.1 ?
 I would greatly appreciate some explanations !

 I am maintaining an NPS Server and I'm a little confused and just wondered if someone could offer some clarity and point me to the right direction.
 I have an NPS Server and we have calendared that the cert is expiring.
 On the server itself, in NPS Management, I go into each of my network policies, constraints and PEAP and look at the certificate. It says it expires in 2024.
 I go into certificate store, local machine, personal and there is a certificate named the same expiring in 5 days time.
 ​
 I guess this might be obvious to some but I don't understand what is different here and how it's different. I also don't know if I need to do anything or not, since I'm seeing what I think is the same cert - twice - I don't want to change anything that breaks my clients...

 How do I do this right? I only have two WS2022 licenses, an esxi8 host server with vCenter that resides on an OOB network that can't see the internet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're using Castlerock SNMPc for all of our SNMP needs. Our network utilizes OSPF on Cisco routers. Every site has multiple routes available at the same time. I'm trying to get Castlerock to show which OSPF route from a site is in use and change from green to (other color) to show when a route is not in use. We do get OSPF traps sent to the Castlerock. But, I can't figure out how to get that interpreted into what I need. I have tried polling ospfNbrIpAddr, but get a "V1: no such name error" error. ospfAdminStat is not what I'm looking for. That shows if a port is "up". I need to see which port is handling the traffic.

Causing minor problems but not showing a good root cause, and despite a lot of investigation you don't find the problem. Then one day you get an idea that leads you down a rabbit hole that finally points to your issue. Maybe this idea comes while taking a shit because solutions come at the weirdest of times. At this point you are infatuated with the issue. You can't get it off your mind. You chip away at it but the more you see the further away it looks. Then out of the corner of your eye you see something that triggers a feeling in your gut. You make your move and the issue is yours and it submits completely. This feeling is better than sex I say, or maybe I'm doing it wrong.

 A software that we use, uses the net use command to change passwords and unlock windows ad accounts with a stored account. 
 ​
 Now I wanted to use this function with a least privilege approach, and use a normal domain user with delgated rights to change passwords and read and write lockout times. Unfortunately as far as i can see, you need an elevated commandline to use the net user active:yes command. So i can't unlock the account, but the password change works without a problem. Is there anyway to get around that, without making the Password change account an Administrator?

 we want to automate the process of enrolling user certifcates. Im testing with a small group right now and superseded the old certifcate template, with a new one where autorenroll is enabled.
 The process itself works fine, all users got the new certificate. But after like 1-2 days some users already got the message again to update the certificate which i really dont understand. Its valid for 7 days, and renewal period is 3 days. So from my understanding popups for autoenroll should only start after 4 days.
 Im really going crazy with that, i checked all logs and the template but i have no idea why these popups are coming up after like 1-2 days. Does anyone maybye has an idea why this does not work out? The productive certificate will be valid for 365 days, but i really dont want to roll that out, as long as i dont understand the renewal period.

 ​
 I use Citrix for my work connection with remote desktop. On my Windows laptop everything works fine, but on my MacBook Citrix always loses the connection when either the screensaver starts or when I close the laptop. I already deactivated energy saving and stuff. As soon as I use the touchpad and the screen goes from black to "normal" (or when I open the laptop again) it says this:
 "Citrix Workspace tries to reconnect for 5 minutes ...."
 ​
 Its strange that it doesnt seem to be a problem with the Mac bc on Windows I dont have this problem and also, why would Citrix disconnect when the laptop is closed but in the same time tries to reconnect? But like I said, the Apple board says it has nothing to do with my MacBook, so I try my luck here.
 ​
 Hope anyone can help me.

 The following error shows up when I try to sign in with Teams on Android:
 Message: AADSTS50020: User account 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' from identity provider 'https://sts.windows.net/11583268-b950-43d0-87ad-50b5dbf95aaa/' does not exist in tenant 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy' and cannot access the application '29d9ed98-a469-4536-ade2-f981bc1d605e'(Microsoft Authentication Broker) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account.
 "Does not exist in tenant" ist just complete BS because I can log in with the account into office.com, the M365 Admin Center and Teams works just fine on my PC. Also online through Chrome/Edge. They also correctly ask for MFA.
 Steps tried so far:
  
Deleted data and cache on phone for the phone app
 Uninstalled and re-installed the phone app
 Removed the work account under accounts and added it again on the phone
 Revoked my MFA in AAD and re-added it again to try and refresh the account
  
What am I missing? Has anyone had this before?

 I have read a few posts here to try and educate myself about Windows Server and what I should be doing. 
 I have some 46 years in IT but unfortunately I know next to nothing about the best way to set up servers for a SaaS type environment. Hoping I can get some feedback / guidance please. 
 My objective is to set up a Dedicated server initially in the best and cheapest way, with the view as hopfully things grow, I can then get additional hardware as required. 
 Currently I have a Dedicated server with OVH as follows ; 
 Windows 2016 Server Standard, MSSQL 2017, 32GB, 2x2TB Drives, Plesk, Intel E3-1260 V6 
 My couple of user facing sites are Wordpress but the actual technology for the businesses are written in ASP using MSSQL. This all runs on the current server config mentioned. No Virtual Machines. 
 My questions are along these lines ; 
 a) should I set up a VM to run MSSQL (and or other things) or is it fine to just run everything as is off the one server environment.
 b) currently running the Intel E3-1260 V6 but I can move to Intel Xeon E-2136 as a special offer, for an extra $6 pm. Should I ? Is it worth the effort to migrate ?
 c) I am in Australia and the server is located in Canada. Lag is pretty bad. I can move to a server in India which is a new offering. Singapore might be another option. Does anyone have any feelings / suggestions as to whether it would be advantageous to move to OVH India as opposed to Canada as far as lag would be concerned ?
 That's all I can think of for now. 
 Thanks in advance for any feedback / suggestions. 
 Cheers

 So... I am an 1st level IT-supporter on a daily basis and work mostly in RDP to our Management (and other) servers, at the same time that our Service Desk and file location is a Cloud solution. We are also using TeamViewer as our remote support tool. Cloud solutions are just becoming more and more relevant for everything.
 The Windows computer is therefore an overkill of a work tool as it costs a lot of money and requires a lot of maintenance + that you also get a work phone as well.
 I have the idea of only using a Samsung Galaxy S23 (or maybe S23 Ultra) as my primary work tool with DeX, which gives me the ability to work with a desktop, just like on a Windows. Then download Microsoft Remote Desktop App, PingTools Network Utilities and other relevant Apps that make my working day productive, smarter and funnier.
 Do you have any experience of working only with a Samsung Galaxy S23 phone (and maybe as an IT-supporter or Sys-admin)? What are your advantages and disadvantages? Which apps would you recommend using? Maybe something else?
 Thanks. Looking forward to hearing your experiences, opinions and recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 ​
 We are managing a new client,
 they are using 4 business premium licences that will expire in a week from a vendor managed by old MSP. 
 We bought new licences from a our vendor. 
 How do I swap the licenses?
 Cant see a way to unlink the licences from the old vendor and swap from the pool of our new vendor. 
 Or goes this automaticly? 
 Kind regards

 Last night we deleted some old users from our O365 admin portal - one of which was an ex IT employee who I believe was a device enrollment manager.
 ​
 Does anyone know if deleting a user with device enrollment manager permissions takes off all the devices that user enrolled from Intune? It's the only reason I can think as to why multiple devices may have gone from Intune overnight.

 Bridged GIF and LAN interface 
 Question is: what should the GIF parent interface should be in this config. 
 Goal: Encrypt L2 traffic over L3 Tunnel. 
 Edit1: Tried to bridge GIF and LAN and used LAN as parent interface, but no luck.
 Thanks.

 I found out company B's security is none existent. Think of a best practice and are likey not even close to following it. Originally I was given the go ahead to fix things. I started making changes to correct the issues. Today I was brought into a meeting with the HIPAA privacy officer for company A and senioer managment in both companies A and B. I was told to stop all remdiation in company B. 
 Reason is managmnet says company B currently cannot handle the changes being made. They feel its overwleming the users. I told them my objections to this coruse of action but was ignored. I was told by the HIPAA privacy officer that patient care is #1 priority and that security changes could not interfer with operations. 
 Frankly I am thinknig of just quiting tomorrow and finding another job. I have sent a email outlining what was said in the meeting and my objections. I feel dumbfounded. Am I wrong here? Dose HIPAA not matter if it would cause possible issues with Patient care? I dont understand honestly It feels very shady. 
 All I can say is I am super depressed after today, I feel like everything I have worked for is crumbling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you think there is a place in IT for people that cannot problem solve? I fully believe in developing people and giving people chances to learn and grow but over the past few years I've noticed study decline in the ability of new hires to problem solve. It has me wondering if this is an issue with the quality of the training, an issue with the quality of the skill set and its match to entry level help desk, or maybe even the covid learning regression that everybody has been talking about.
 I can easily spot someone lacking critical thinking skills when they work smoothly within set protocols, but get totally stuck and need help from a supervisor or colleague when faced with something unexpected. It's like they prefer routine and can't handle new stuff – they seem kind of aloof from independent thinking. 
 Thoughts anyone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m CTO. Another C-suite tripped an alarm by using a VPN that goes to a cloud virtual desktop / domain. He uses a password to access some cloud (AWS or AZURE) and from there launches RDP to some VM.
 I shut it down at the end of the day to give myself reasons that this isn’t OK.
  
a terrible MSP with a bad track record set this up for him, I’d sooner daily drive Windows ME than use these clowns
 
the guy is massively dunning krugered, good at excel means you know IT and infosec
 
I suspect they runs generic AV on other domain 
 
The other company surely has monitoring and network access to us when he opens that tunnel
 
I am being told he isn’t accessing anything but RDP, but at the very least it’s also radius or Kerberos I assume
 
My first thought is he doesn’t understand our network is his network when using a VPN and vs.
 
I’m concerned about malware on his side, but he should be concerned from both sides
 
I need alternatives. What the “right” way to do this would be.
 
I know right-right is to make him use a second laptop and the guest wifi. But, that probably won’t fly, at least he’ll fight it
 
 Anything else I should be concerned about? Any way to harden this? I’d also take things to embarrass him with, anything to further corrective behavior.
 Thoughts?

 Quick preface: ive been in telecom for about 4 years and have a good bit of experience in fiber, Copper, Access Controls, Cameras, Radios, you name it and ive probably touched it or been around it on a job.
 I have a pretty decent understanding of networking theory and Im studying for Network+ at the moment. Its all coming to me pretty easy because of my telecom background and having a background in computers/tech.
 My question to you networking professionals out there would be what would be a good way to get my foot in the door to this industry? would it be through certs? talking to recruiters? A little of all? Any advice/stories would help me in my journey to switch up career paths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So long story short, one of two HP 5412Zzl switches died, functioning as a core switch. 
 core switch 1 failed, and core switch 2 was "salvaged" to recover it.
 during disaster recovery modules were moved from core switch 2 into core switch 1 and reconfigured to accommodate. 
 another 5412zl failed elsewhere on site, and was completely converted to new switches, thus is no longer needed. 
 the issue was discovered to be bad RAM module, (PC-3200U CL3, ancient). but I happen to be a pack rat, and had like 20 dimms at home.
 modules have been recovered from the 5412zl that's no longer needed, and core switch 2 is now operational. modules are reloaded into core switch 2, and we are attempting to reconfigure ports and running into difficulty.
 even basic commands like shut/no shut, give "invalid input: shut".
 "sh int brief" shows all the ports on the modules, "sh modules" shows all the modules. 
 I've tried rebooting the switch.
 reseating the module 
 changing control planes 
 changing RAM.
 all switches were running the same boot ROM, and OS version
 currently I'm thinking "sh modules" and then "no module x" for every one of them then, then reboot.
 anybody familiar with this issue? I'm hoping to resolve this issue without destroying the existing config (which I have backed up anyways)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently using Unifi(not my choice) have a FOG imaging server sitting at 192.168.0.100/24, on our native VLAN. I have different VLANS across the office that I want to be able to PXE boot into that server from other addresses. This is new territory for me and I have been playing with DHCP relays(Unifis versions of DHCP Helpers) to no avail. I am running DNSmasq on the fog server but I am not really sure if that has something to do with this. I really want any client to be able to ping as well as access this machine sitting at 192.168.0.100 as well as 192.168.0.5 but I cannot seem to get my firewall rules in Unifi to allow this either at least the pinging part. But overall the DHCP PXE boot stuff is most important, works perfectly as long as my client is on the native VLAN but I dont want my whole org on that subnet. Thanks everyone I know this is probably super basic stuff for real admins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently network addressing is a mess and I need a little help.
 This my first time trying to design networking for multiple sites. I'm looking for best practices for the following:
 Addressing for multiple sites. Should you subnet each site and each site VLAN or should you have a big pool that spans sites for things like wifi, phones, workstations, guests?
 Currently DHCP is independent at each site with a local failover. At small remote sites where a local failover is not possible or there is no local DHCP at all (single or no server) what is best practice for DHCP? Failover with another site or multiple sites if no local DHCP?
 Appreciate your help.

If your support request than falls outside that one thing you get ping ponged over to another team that has no context of your issue. so you end up explaining your issue over and over and over again with no end result.

Vendor Management, Support, Infrastructure refresh, Azure migration...if you do it in IT in a smaller company, I've done it.
 Returning to this headhunter. Pay is about a 20% increase to do LESS work than I do now. A little more high level but WELLLL within my wheelhouse.
 I got rejected after doing a personality test. Can I tell you how absolutely frustrating that is?
 I never even got to talk to the hiring manager. I got weeded out by the professional equivalent of "What Harry Potter House would you be in?"
 The kicker? They reposted the job 2 days ago on LinkedIn.

 I'm going through the BGP Communities lesson on NetworkLessons.com, and it has a scenario we in which a customer router is connected to an ISP, and that ISP is connected to two other ISPs, one in Europe and one elsewhere. It has a community value option to prepend its AS four times routes leading to the European ISP for customers that choose to use a certain community value. But given that different customers may have different customized requirements besides AS prepending (or even different expectations for prepending, like 3 prepends instead of 4), how does the ISP overcome the limitation of one route map per neighbor (per direction)? Thank you.

 We got internet coming into a small managed switch, and that switch is then providing uplink to our WAN port on our Firewall. But then.. our Main Switch #2 is getting internet connectivity on from that SAME small switch too.
 So 2 sources of internet connectivity. The Firewall isn't indicating any loops or anything like that, but I am being told that this might be the reason why internet is malfunctioning at our office. This is meraki equipment.
 A. Main internet connects too -> small switch #1B. Small switch #1 connects to our Firewall's WAN port.C. small switch #1 connects to our Main Switch #2 - where computers get internet from.D. Firewall is connecting too -> Main switch #2.
 So 2 connections doing the same thing. Any thoughts? Thank you!! 
 The only thing this small switch #1 is doing, is providing uplink/network connectivity to the Firewall, and our switch, it does nothing else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing a lab, I have 2 sites one main, one satellite, both connect to an ISP. I intend for the satellite to be entire RFC 1918 and be routed directly back to the main site to go through a firewall before going back to ISP for internet.
 Now... I have ZERO experience working with an ISP, I have been DoD my whole life and the rules are different so bear with me on my self-made constraints.
 I don't want the satellite to be globally routable, I want it to be composed entirely of private IPs. (I don't know if this is how it works in the real world to be honest, do companies purchase public IP space for every satellite site?)
 So how would an ISP handle this? I am tempted to put the satellite entirely on a VRF and use MPBGP vpnv4 to route back to the main site, but I feel like there is a way to keep the satellite on the global routing table and then just be on a vrf at the main site till it reaches the FW.
 Am i making sense? How would the configs look on the PE/CE side of the satellite site? I am drawing a blank.
 Also, if this isn't how a situation like this is normally done as well, please let me know. I'm trying to lab practical examples, but not very creative.
 Bonus question: I also have not gotten to the ASA portion, but if anyone knows and wants to confirm my thought, I was going to sub interface the satellite site from the router to ASA and on the ASA side create a semi trusted zone. But I haven't worked with the ASA enough to know if it supports sub interfaces and if 1 physical port can exist in two zones or if ill need a 2nd connection.

 Thanks!

 I am up for most ideas (to make this BGP VPN tunnel work) short of replacing the Kerio.

We found that many people would knock simply out of curiosity, or ask about it. Instead we put a label that said "IT Department" along with a short, detailed message about how we no longer accept in-person requests, and to please submit a ticket (along with a QR code which directs to a form submission). However people will see "IT Department" and simply knock anyway, glossing over the message and QR code. I asked a few people and they said they basically didn't see it. Selective vision I guess.
 Anyway, I'd like to replace our label with something that will almost guarantee nobody knocks unless they know that we actually occupy this office. Most people are remote and only attend the office on occasion, so the people who know we're in here are few and far between.
 I was thinking "Electrical" would probably work fine.
 What would you put?

 I need your advice how to properly copy my pictures from one to another backup drive on Windows 11.
 I manage all my pictures with Lightroom and have those pictures on my internal SSD.
 Once done with editing, I move them with Lightroom to an external HDD as first backup.
 I now want to create a second backup on an external SSD by copying the HDD 1 by 1 to it.
 In the past I used Hetzner Storage Box with rSync but as i don't want to store my backup in the cloud anymore I ask myself if rSync is still the right tool to copy from HDD to SSD or if maybe robocopy is a better choice.
 Is there anything I have to pay attention to when copying from HDD to SDD - any special commands?
 Thanks in advance for sharing your experience and help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 For some time now, we have been toying with moving files from our onprem infra to Teams environment. Some background first, we have 10ish locations around the world, each location has between 20 and 60 people. Each location has local infra with servers for failover dhcp, dns, printing etc. Our DC's have been moved to aws few years back. DC's run dhcp and dns, AD, nap etc. No issues since we moved them. Each location also has 2 Synology units, one hosting all files and folder shares and second for backup. File and folder shares range between 500GB and 1.5TB organized mostly by dept. Over the last few years we migrated some "easier" departments from onprem to Teams/OneDrive. Once migrated users would simply go to Teams, their Team name, files and click on Sync and this would give users familiar access to files rather than accessing files through Teams interface. Apart from some occasional issues (mostly caused by Microsoft) we haven't had any real issues with this solution.
 We are running hybrid AD/AAD. Auto pilot deployments, MFA and conditional access have been implemented. Only domain joined equipment can access O365 environment.
 Now we are thinking of taking a plunge and simply migrating all sites and all departments. There are some debates over this as advantages are mostly for IT with few exceptions for end user, such as files are available anywhere, no need for VPN. 
 There is also some chatter that storing files in Teams gives you better protection against crypto viruses but not sure how much and if true.
 We have also not considered any backup yet. Management is saying that 90 days is good enough because anything older than 90 days is useless anyway. 
 Has anyone done something similar, pros and cons, ideas, real life best practices appart from Microsoft is suggesting.
 Also, we are small IT team, 2 ppl, one in NA and one in EU. Yes we do it all.

 I am currently looking into this and I see how to do it using OnPrem servers for Domain joined as well as InTune/Azure for AzureAD joined computers, but we have a mixture of both.
 Will I need to manage both types of computers seperately or can I do them all in AzureAD/InTune? We are in a Hybrid environment where our OnPrem AD syncs with AzureAD.
 Looking for tutorials and finding them for each type but nothing explaining if you're in a hybrid environment.
 Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in my current organization for over 15 years, starting from the help desk at Tier 1 and have moved up through the ranks over the years to eventually be where I am now, the network admin. I really enjoy what I do and from the IT side at least, the work is far more meaningful and significant. The role is of course much different though, I rarely directly interact with the staff and most of what I do, at least if it's done correctly, is completely transparent to anyone. The network is really just a utility at this point, no one ever notices it unless there's a problem. 
 Doing some housekeeping on my (very) old files, I came across all of my work from back in the help desk days. It reminded me how things were much different back then, I interacted with pretty much all of the staff in the building regularly. The work I did, even though it was mundane nonsense like maintaining labs and carts, was completely visible. Since the help desk is the first point of contact for anything, I also worked directly with our tech time much closer than I do today. Unlike today, work back then was appreciated, even if it was something very basic because it directly helped someone. Many of the work relationships I built and the reputation I built came directly from the work I did back then. 
 Maybe I'm just feeling overly nostalgic, but even though the work I do today is much more rewarding on the IT side and the pay is obviously much better, it kind of feels like everything else is worse and it leaves me missing those days and interactions. Am I just crazy or does anyone else who made this same journey feel the same?

Email worm sent from a known contact about collaborating on a document. Document hosted in the sender's company sharepoint. 
 
User opens document and it has a URL to an evilginx hosted MFA token stealer. MFA sign in token stolen
 
M365 defender for endpoint, Advanced Threat Protection, Intune office macros disabled policies etc let everything pass
 
Hacker script uses token to sign in with "MFA requirement satisfied by claim in the token"
 
The same worm sent to all contacts (The only difference this time is the worm used a generic free onedrive link to share the new booby trapped document instead of the company sharepoint as anon sharing is disabled in tenant sharepoint). 
 
Worm propagates 
 
 ​
 MFA is useless to this unfortunately. I am researching why conditional access for "only compliant devices" did not work here. Maybe needs the new Token protection condition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have a bunch of non domain joined machines I need to deal with. These are computers that run lab instruments are often provided by the vendor or our computers that never got upgraded to Win10 because <insert stupid reason that is to long to go into here>
 So they have been out on an isolated network. I am upgrading what I can but it takes time, mainly in the form of explaining to scientists yes I can upgrade this computer, yes it will still work. 
 I would like a program to manage patches, firmware, Remote Desktop session and most importantly wake on Lan (if possible). They love to turn these machines off at night and then I can’t push stuff to them overnight. Being able to manage everything from one console would be cool too. 
 Normally we use SCCM for our domain joined computers. However trying to explain this to our SCCM folks is…tiresome. The one I tested with they just Reimaged and upgraded to our win10 image. Luckily it was a test and I picked a sacrificial machine we could spare. So not dealing with those morons again. 
 I am pretty sure their are alternatives I can use but pardon I am used to big enterprise domain joined sccm managed machines and not used to doing things this way. 
 Looking for recommendations. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, longtime lurker here. I have two questions, that I will preface with some background:
 I work for a small company as the only "IT Guy". I recently was encouraged to deploy an on-prem server both in-house, and for one of our clients. I muddled my way through, and learned a lot, but I should have been better prepared. In light of that realization, I started looking into MS Certs. I don't see any Certs listed for on-prem environments. Lots of Cert for Azure, and a few for Hybrid, but not for on-prem only, that I could find.
 So the questions:
 Are there still Cert tracks for on-prem environments?
 Does it matter?
 Should I just follow the Azure Cert tracks? 
 For some additional background: I used Windows XP extensively, in my early teen years. I then switched to Mac for ~1 year, then switched to Linux. I have been primarily using Linux (Arch, FTW) for over a decade, up until this most recent job role, (about 2 years in my current role) when I gradually transitioned to using Windows again. I've been diving into Powershell very heavily (Windows finally has a usable CLI??) I also purchased "Deploying and Managing Active Directory with Windows PowerShell: Tools for cloud-based and hybrid environments" and read most of it, and continue to use it heavily as a reference book. In reading that, I found that the author recommended "Windows Server 2008 Administrator's Companion", so I also purchased that. I have read a number of chapters, but mostly use that as a reference book.

 As the person responsible for these and often tasked with error analysis and troubleshooting, managing these different logs has become increasingly challenging. Today, while consolidating 7 logs based on timestamps, I reached my breaking point, prompting me to look for solutions.
 That's when I stumbled upon the concept of Log Aggregation, which seems to be the exact solution I need. However, there's an overwhelming flood of different service providers, all claiming to be the ultimate solution.
 Based on my research so far, I've been particularly intrigued by the combination of Grafana and Loki. But before committing, I'd love to hear about your best practices for this issue.
 TL;DR: Help needed with Log Management for multiple servers and applications. Log aggregation seems like the solution, considering Grafana and Loki. Seeking best practices and advice from the Reddit community. Your support is highly appreciated!

 Does anyone know whether IGMP snooping + a querier will reduce a multicast packets TTL?
 My understanding was that if the packet stays within the same VLAN then the TTL shouldn't be reduced but we're seeing packets with a TTL of 1 being dropped on the input interface whilst packets with higher TTL are forwarded to the receiver.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far the relationship with this customer has always been alright, at least no major complaints except of some things out of our control (Office 364 uptime lol).Last week though we had an issue with one of their users who wasn't happy with solution A and wanted to attempt potential solution B. After warning them that solution A is much better suited and more likely to work as expected they refused because of convenience and we went forward with solution B, resulting in about 3 hrs of work that they had to pay for and still no functioning solution for their problem because - as expected - solution B did not work as expected (also because we had no expert for it in out Team, which they were also told about beforehand).
 So now with every one of their new requests it's like walking on eggshells because they will most certainly go off and ask if it's gonna work 100% guaranteed, because if not they start saying how we don't meet their expectations for a good IT service provider as we need to be able to offer 100% guaranteed working solutions. Meanwhile they are calling like twice a day because of weird issues and full blown incompetence to operate a computer.
 At this point I'm not even arguing with them anymore, this and all of their open tickets went straight to my boss to deal with. It feels like someone from craigslist trying to bargain by shitting all over your product (while still depending on it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a 400-user org running a couple of 2012R2 servers which will reach the end of life in October. We dont have any files on the servers but use it more for Federation services, AD, user auth, GPOs, print services, RDP, etc. Exchange is also hybrid but can be moved to cloud. 
 Currently evaluating if we should upgrade the servers to newer v2022 or migrate the remaining services to the cloud.
 Servers are a safe bet since its familiar and no change management is required and for this reason I want to stay in the same hybrid setup with upgrading the servers. 
 However, senior mgmt wants to investigate cloud migration options as well properly.
 I've put together both options regarding the cost but can't seem to provide more details on the risks involved with migrating to the cloud.
 If we move to the cloud, we'll have to deploy Intune to replace GPOs, move print services to AWS/Azure, etc.
 For me, it's more about a mental block for making that change because i know there will be nuanced changes that might become a pain, (or maybe not)
 Anyone who's been in a similar situation situation? what documentation would you provide for the risks associated with both options? and how to frame the recommendation for the management?

 Is there an easier way of doing this? I know there's intune but they won't pay for the licences. We only have 365 business standard licences assigned to the users which as far as I'm aware, does not include Intune.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im lucky to be able to rebuild our entire network / server room as my company is moving in a new modern office building soon. I have a lot of Linux Sysadmin, but only basic / intermediate networking knowledge which I want to improve with this project.
 I am planning on going with:
  
two 42 unit racks for all the servers and network hardware
 PFSense Firewall Cluster (2x Netgate 1541 Appliance, for FW, IDS, DHCP, DNS),
 10GB symmetrical WAN Uplink with a 500/50 backup link)
 2x 48P POE+ Switches for the clients
 4x 24P 10GB Switches for the Servers
 One or Two UPS per Rack, still researching options here.
  
Does this sound reasonable?
 We have about 40-50 servers ( ~ 15 bare metal, the rest vm's / containers on two proxmox-nodes, windows, Debian, a few Centos) and about 50 clients. We are 31 employees and are growing up to 40 in the next 2 years.
 What I am unsure about is on how I would go on on planning the segmentation of the new network, whats best practice for a network of this size? Hook up everything physically together, use one big subnet and then use VLAN's to segment it? Any Links for good Guides, How-tos, real world examples?
 Im planning on separate Segments for
 - Clients
 - Guests
 - VOIP
 - Windows-Servers
 - Linux Servers
 - Infrastructure (Switches, FW, UPS, etc.)
 Does it make sense to run the basic network services like DHCP and DNS on the PFSense Cluster? Of course there will also be DNS Services from our Active-Directory running for the windows-part. Im asking because my predecessor had setup separate BIND-Servers running right now for DNS on the non-windows area, which looks like over complicating things to me?
 I am also thinking about hiring a network-consultant to work trough the design and setup phase with m e, but am not sure its really needed.
 I appreciate any input!

 Our company is a small one, with less than 50 employees, currently no physical location, so everyone is working from their own home. Only Azure online services for the time being, we don't have an onprem system at all. Every User has his own device, and at the beginning, some were enrolled via a script to the MDE to be able to control the devices from afar. it didn't seem to work as far as they needed. I advised them to use Intune for it, but to use it via intune we needed better licenses. 
 So we got the licenses and I started enrolling all the machines which were not enrolled till now. Which are like 90% of them. 
 Now to my question:
 How can I offboard a device from MDE, to give the device user full control over it without a complete reinstall? 
 The Users are all around the world, so it is not feasible for them to send the devices back to us, for us to reinstall the device it correctly.

I understand from performance and resource usage stand point why it is much better, but I would like to get into details: why virtual router&firewall is that bad? 
 Maybe it's so low performance that I should not even take in consideration, maybe it's really unreliable, maybe it's easy to bypass, maybe it's really hard to configure, maybe it's really easy to make mistake
 I would just like to know more details instead of blindly fixating on hardware (even though I understand it's probably right).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We send phishing simulation emails to user's Outlook clients with a 3rd party SaaS. I've also have globally enrolled the 'Report Message' add-in for all our users, that they're actively using. (Add-in from Microsoft themselves)
 I've seen in the Defender 365 Admin portal that Microsoft automatically detects these simulation emails and puts them under "Phishing simulations".
 Now, I want to make some sort of Exhange rule that 'rewards' the user after they've succesfully reported a simulation email from us. This could either be a notification that pops up, or an email.
 The whole point of making this is to let users see that they've succesfully reported a simulation email, + minimizing labor to manually reply to these simulation emails in the 365 Defender portal.
 Can someone guide me in the right direction to make such a rule?
 I've already looked at numerous of Exchange rules, but I don't see an option anywhere to detect if a user has reported an email. On the other hand, detecting a phishing simulation of ours is quite easy since there's always an unique value in the email header that we can detect.
 I was thinking about something like this:
 User reports email > system checks if certain header value matches that of our phishing simulations > send notification/email to user who reported the email.
 Thanks!
 (Please go easy on me, since I'm quite new to this stuff!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So... it turns out that in the SMTP transaction, the SMTP server only will send an email to the person listed in the RCPT TO command. Which means that it doesnt care about the TO header, so you can really fake who actually received it.
 Or in otherwords, its how the BCC actually works. The SMTP client sends an email to each BCC address, and in the DATA block it just doesnt put their email address in any of the headers.
 The more you know
 P.S. I didnt know what flag to use, so I used the question solved. As I solved my own unasked question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client who is setting up an app server which will be communicating with an onsite database and making API calls to an external service. The API calls to be secured with a certificate.
 In this scenario, their internal domain does not match the domain they own externally. As an example, they own bestsysadmin.com, but their internal domain is internal.sysadmin.com . 
 We have a wildcard cert for *.bestsysadmin.com. 
 Is there a way for be to secure the app server appserver.internal.sysadmin.com using this wildcard cert? I am told that the certificate either needs to match the internal.sysadmin.com domain for this, or the server needs to be on bestsysadmin.com domain for this to work. 
 I thought, perhaps we would be able to use a self-signed certificate and give it to the external vendor who run the API but apparently thats not going to be possible.
 Another suggestion was to add bestsysadmin.com as a UPN on the domain, which I've done but I am unsure how the server would then be presented as appserver.bestsysadmin.com.
 Hopefully this makes sense as I feel like I'm a little out of my depth at the moment with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking at the documentation, Cisco supports complex regex statements such as positive lookahead. However, I can't think of a situation where positive lookahead could not be handled by less confusing syntax that achieves the same thing. 
 For example, if I wanted to set a community value for routes that contain AS 100 followed by AS 200, I could configure:
 route-map LOOKAHEAD permit 10 match as-path 1 set community 65000:100 additive ! ip as-path access-list 1 permit 100(?=_200)
 Or
 route-map DIRECT-MATCH permit 10 match as-path 2 set community 65000:100 additive ! ip as-path access-list 2 permit 100_200
 Has anyone found a good use case for positive (or negative, for that matter) lookahead?

 It works differently from how almost all other Windows ISO downloader projects work in that it interacts with Microsoft's downloading API (reverse engineered) to always get the newest release of Windows as soon as it's officially released!

 I'm using the edits provided by Microsoft:

 (the APs have a guest network that uses a different subnet)
 (there's also a hidden network that uses the same subnet as the LAN)
 (the router is the DHCP server for LAN and both APs, supposedly)
 But those ports still have a PVID of 1 as show below.
 https://imgur.com/a/qT5K91v
 What I'm having trouble understand is.... are these VLAN assignments even necessary if the ports are still on PVID 1?
 I tested the setup on a spare switch and I can ping devices connected to those ports from any other port.

There is some construction work taking place at that location so the 2 devices need to move temporarily to another location but still get the overnight updates. These are Linux based touchscreen devices and kind of prehistoric, the static IPs are configured on the server to push updates overnight.
 Both sites have watchguards and currently different subnets for the devices on site. I am far from a network engineer but have a fairly good understanding, this job is mixed so this piece of work is new for me. How can I connect these two sites together and plug the 2 devices into the network of the temporary site (different subnet) but retain the current static IPs. Branch to Branch VPN comes to mind, not completely sure how to configure it. It may be possible for me to change the static IPs on the server end if I can configure the network to see the other subnet? 
 Apologies if this is not the best explanation.. any helped is appreciated.

 My company email has been getting loads of impersonation emails as other "coworkers" from different Gmail addresses. Luckily everyone has been sharp enough to report the impersonation emails from our security trainings and a banner showing it's an external sender but they're becoming a nuisance with the frequency we're getting them, e.g. several a week. The most our MSP does is block the Gmail addresses. Is there anymore to do? We're on 365E5. Are there add on services to help combat this?

We are looking to get our appliance backups in order, but are noticing that the requirements for backing these things up are vastly different from one another. I'd hate to request 3 different backup solutions for 3 different products from our sysadmin team, but I will if I have to.
 My question to those who have all 3, what are you folks doing to backup these pieces of your environment?

 We used the Azure calculator to predict costs and after the first month have concerns about pricing. It's not totally over the top of what we predicted but definitely want to try to reduce the cost. 
 We do have reserve instances bought for our VMs. The biggest concern is the VM windows licensing cost. 
 Wondering if anyone has tips on reducing the price of the windows licensing. Doesn't look like we can buy a "reservation" for windows licensing like we can for compute reservations. 
 Would it be worth it to buy windows licensing with software assurance and use Azure Hybrid benefits. Or would that end up costing more then using the Pay-as-you-go licensing costs? 
 Any tips or recommendations are appreciated.

 Today I had a meeting to have some functionality wired up. I didn't see said functionality on my end but the person wiring it up said it was resolved
 So I ask, "I see you can do it on your end, but on ours we don't have that option. Can you double check we have the permissions please?"
 And this other guy in the meeting says to me, "The point of this meeting is to ensure we have those permissions, /u/IWasAroundIWasaround."
 Which to me is a stupid response. It's stupid because I clearly understand the goal and reason for the meeting. Otherwise, I wouldn't have brought up the fact the goal hadn't been ahcieved.
 It's like you have two people - Bill and Ted. Bill works for Ted.
 Bill goes to Ted and says, "Hi, Bill. When is X due?" and Bill looks him in the eye and says, "You know X has to be done by the deadline, right?
 Of course Ted knows that. That is the very reason he asked when the deadline was.
 And they walk away thinking they're smart and you're dumb. 🤫🙄

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm facing a decision regarding our organization's multi-site internet setup and could really use some insights. Currently, we have three separate sites, each with its own fiber internet connection and an elan for inter-site traffic.
 I'm considering the possibility of consolidating our setup so that the second and third sites access the internet through the first site's connection. This would mean relying on the elan to connect the sites and having one central firewall. 
 There seem to be various pros and cons to this approach. On the positive side, we'd benefit from increased bandwidth at the larger site and potentially simplify our internet management. On the flip side, there's the concern of a single point of failure and the potential for one site to consume too much bandwidth.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter. Any opinions, advice, or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

 We've embraced micro-segmentation with our laptops and desktops so they're out of scope. That still leaves me with a number of printers, badge readers, cameras, IoT devices, etc. that I need to make sure is authorized (~500 devices).
 I have hands on experience with Forescout, but am not a fan of the Java and Windows requirement to manage the environment amongst other frustrations. The other industry colleagues I've spoken with tells me that ISE is overly complicated for my requirements. So, I'm leaning towards giving FortiNAC and Clearpass a shot.

 I have a nginx web server set up to use QUIC. I've confirmed that it's able to respond to quic requests through curl and packcaps.
 when I attempt to connect to it through Chrome (or any other quic-capable browser), the browser never attempts to send a UDP packet to connect; packet capturing indicates that the browser has no problem talking to other servers (e.g. youtube) using http3/quic. with (linux) chrome, I've tried forcing with --origin-to-force-quic-on=<host>:<port> .. no luck, still uses TCP.
 It seems that the browsers will only attempt to connect via QUIC if they first connect via TCP and get an alt-srv header; this doesn't make sense to me since the whole purpose of QUIC is to reduce the initial number of RTTs.

What I've done is consolidate smaller contracts I've done at mom and pop stores and put them into my own consulting company. I don't really want to list every 3 month contract I've ever done. I put the end date as 2022 or 2023 for this company but I've used it as an experience booster for about ten years. It's essentially a geek squad for my friends and family but companies seem really nervous about this? 
 If I remove the consulting stuff, I'll have about six years of IT experience and 10 years of customer service experience before that.

 I have a web application that I'm trying to get it to utilize a https link with a modern browser. I've got the certificate bound that isn't expired, utilized IISCrypto running PCI 4.0 template, and have DNS configured. I can browse to it in http(with DNS name) but HTTPS doesn't cooperate. The website works in IE but I cannot connect with Edge, Chome, or Firefox and I get a connection reset when I do so. The Console log is saying crbug/1173575, non-js module files deprecated which leads me to believe it's a setting somewhere. 
 The vendor is saying it's our side with something network related but I can't find anything that would stop it from working in modern browsers. 
 Wondering if anyone has run into this before or a director they can point me?

 Documentation says "Your IP routes must be globally unique (“public IPs”) rather than RFC 1918 address ranges. In other words, your IP routes have to be outside of theses ranges: RFC1918" One of the engineers our Sales rep pointed us to, confirmed this.
 It sounds like we need something on our MPLS edge to NAT our internal networks to publicly routable IP's over a private circuit, to do BGP with Twilio. I hate dealing with NAT when using SIP.

It's tiring and preventing us getting on with normal bau work!
 Oh and the best part, we have a legal requirement to answer every request for audit / information under UK freedom of information law, we simply cannot say no.
 It's driving me crazy! A case of a law that is just abused and is a huge waste of money for public finance. We are getting to the point of possibly employing someone to just answer these supplier question permanently.

 When activating Windows 10 Enterprise, it’s an add-on on top of an activated copy of Windows 10 Pro. This Pro activation is normally detected from the BIOS. 
 After you install the local Hyper-V role and build a local VM using the Windows 10 Enterprise ISO downloaded from the VLSC, how does this automatic license activation work on the virtual machine? Does it pick up anything from the host machine? If you manually activate Windows with a MAK key in the Hyper-V guest machine, isn’t that gong to trigger use of another license instead of using the free licensing you are entitled to for one local VM?

 I paid the higher price and the domain name still wasn't added to my account after purchasing.
 The registrar told me that, since it is a premium domain, it can take a week to transfer over from another registrar.
 A few days pass and then they tell me they refunded me because the seller no longer owns the domain. I asked for a better explanation.
 Then they sent me this:
 "Aftermarket premium domain" means that this domain is already owned by an individual and that person is selling it via our platform. They decide their own prices for the sale as the owner. We are simply facilitating this transaction and ensure the safety of payment. In this case the owner of the listing was able to deliver the domain to you, that is why we issued a full refund for the transaction.
 I'm assuming "was able" is a typo for "wasn't able" but is this all normal registrar behavior? I feel like I just got scammed out of a domain name.

 Just to be clear i do not HAVE to use linux but i'd like to familiarize myself more with it by just using it as a daily operating system.
 However, since i work as an IT employee in a mainly 99% windows environment i struggle to see whatever i could actually do in linux, all the tools i use to work in active directory, dns, dhcp etc ... are all windows based and i'm not sure if there are equivalent programs even in linux that do not require only command line stuff.
 and installing a windows vm is just a bit ... pointless then.
 So i was curious are there others like me who use linux but also maintain a pure windows environment in their corporation.
 What tools do you use for what tasks ?
 i mainly use powershell and the mmc.exe console that uses snap ins for active directory/dhcp/dns/group policy ...

 I had a question as I am not sure what to do next to fix my network issues.
 I am using a windows PC with a TP link wifi card. It has been great in the past and is a good wifi card. I don’t believe it is the issue.
 I have recently been getting my wifi just drop out mid game, then sometimes come back but really poorly (around the 300 mark in cs go ping) but then sometimes be stable at around 20 ping in cs go. This process kinda repeats itself and I wouldn’t be able to get through a game without my network dying at least 2 or 3 times a game.
 I also tried to look at it before and my computer was able to find the network at full strength, however when I tried to connect it was ‘secured’ (then bellow) ‘Can’t connect to this network’. 
 I have checked and IPV4 and 6 are both set to automatically detect/set themselves up.
 I have dealt with a fair few network issues before, but they are always far more complicated to me than other issues so I am wondering if anyone would be able to give me some ideas on how to best fix this.
 Thanks heaps! Kind Regards, Me :)

 When they open the ADUC snap-in and right, click it and run as administrator with their credentials, they are able to get in and search AD, but they are unable to reset a user‘s password. It tells them that higher elevation is needed. Here’s where it gets strange: They can right click ADUC and run as administrator from their account on my laptop and reset a users password with no issues. So by that, I think I’ve pinpointed it down to something on the client. Permissions or something?

 I'm trying to figure out a solution for shared folders across depts. One drive has a great Shared Library option but I cannot find out what happens to members access once the creator of the Shared library leaves the company. I have read that there is a notification to all members that access will be removed within x amount of days and for them to remove any files they need.
 I'd prefer if it didn't force members to set up another shared library and inform everyone of the new location. Is there a workaround for this. Does making a few of the members owners in the permissions allow the files to remain?
 I've no one leaving anytime soon to test this myself thankfully so any insights would be great.

Thus, I've got to upgrade the VPN server to UDP/TCP protocols. Also, there was a recommendation from Infosec that we use 2FA for each user. My initial choice was OpenVPN, but I found out that it only supports two concurrent connections on the free tier.
 I need a VPN server that has the following features:
 - free (no cost) for 20+ users
 - supports both TCP and UDP
 - supports 2FA
 - easy to setup :)))
 Do you have any recommendations? If someone had a similar use case it would help a lot to be directed to the right vpn server.

Here's an overview of the situation: I set up an SSH server (OpenSSH) on my Windows PC with key and passphrase authentication enabled for security. I wanted to use SFTP from a remote location, but I didn't want to keep my PC running all the time. So, I used a CMD command to put the computer to sleep remotely, and I also set up a scheduled task to wake it up in the morning.
 I have a site-to-site VPN, and I can see that it's turned on by checking the connected devices in the router (inside the active devices on the LAN). However, I'm facing an issue where I cannot access the SSH session. I'm getting an error code 1005, indicating that the host is unreachable. I suspect that the service was not started, although it's set to automatically start. When I was at home for testing, I successfully put the PC to sleep using the power button from the Windows menu and verified that it worked.
 Now, the PC is running, and I have no control over it. Is this the situation I'm in? Are there any suggestions on what I could try?

Some proper MDM is long overdue. I've been searching reddit quite a bit and the conclusion seems to be that there is no MDM product that does both platforms well, so my idea was to use Azure AD as our directory service, Intune as MDM for our Windows laptops and add on a third party Mac-focused MDM like Mosyle or something similar. Anybody here have experience with a similar setup? I don't have much experience setting up these kinds of things so any advice is welcome.
 Also, I think we need MS 365 Business Premium for every user to make use of Azure AD and Intune, but we use our own CRM product for e-mail currently and most people do not need Office applications so quite a few features of the Business Premium are redundant. Personally I would prefer using Exchange Online over our own product but I'm not sure I could get management on board and migrating the mailboxes would be a bitch. Are there are alternative licensing options to make use of Azure AD + Intune without all the Exchange and Office features? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 6months into my first IT job at a small MSP with only the owner and myself. Being we are a small operation and the boss is very much a 'fire fighter' sort of person...there is literally no documentation at all. Nada. Pretty much every issue I encounter has been a new one until recently (except password resets) I would like to start creating a searchable database/knowledge base that I can turn to as my first port of call for any issues I encounter and was wondering if there is any specific software/program that people would recommend? It's frustrating knowing I've had a similar issue but can't exactly remember how I solved it previously.
 Any advice greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I have a few questions about Remote Desktop Gateway deployment, and I was hoping someone could help me. I've tested a few things already, and most things seem to work, but not everything. I've inherited a setup where there were RDS cals bought, but never used. I'm trying to set up everything correctly, so there's no problem in the future.
  
Our users need to access their desktop computers that stay in the office. Is it okay to only run the Gateway, and let the users connect through that? My understanding is that I need the connection broker and the session host only if people will be connecting to a special RDS host.
 How does license assignment work in case of only using the Gateway? Do I even need the CAL's? Because I've tried a few connections, and even though the CAL's are installed, they aren't being assigned to users, despite multiple different connections.
 Is it possible to use something like DUO for MFA over RD Gateway, but not require people to use it when in the office, in front of their computers?
 Is there any cheap (preferably free?) way of monitoring and reporting on the sessions? Aside from writing a script that watches WMI like a hawk for RD Gateway connections.

 I have a tenant that is on 'targeted release for everyone' (more info here).
 I've read the documentation where it explains the below
  
The different products effected
 If moving from targeted to 'targeted for select users' there are certain features that are organisation features and therefore will get rolled back to standard for everyone.
 Targeted release features will get rolled back (possibly 2-3 months worth of releases).
  
I was wondering if anyone has updated from 'targeted for everyone' to 'standard for everyone'.
 If so, what specific issues did you have (for both admins and users), or any things that I should be aware about that actual experience has shed light on, as I need to propose this change to management.
 Thanks in advance,
 Max

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ran into frustrating problem with my computer, and hope that someone here can help me solve it or at least point me in the right direction. For few weeks now, my monitor doesn't go to sleep anymore when I lock my PC. Usually I would use Win + L, and monitor would go to sleep after about 1 minute.
 Now for some reason monitor never goes to sleep. I already checked all the basic things with power settings etc. but in the end I found "powercfg /requests" command that shows what is preventing my monitor from entering sleep mode:
 PS C:\> powercfg /requests 
 DISPLAY: [PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume5\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe
 SYSTEM: [PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume5\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe
 AWAYMODE: None.
 EXECUTION: [PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume5\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe Playing audio
 PERFBOOST: None.
 ACTIVELOCKSCREEN: None.
 Lets ignore msedge.exe, since it's running right now and playing music. But even if I close all programs on my PC, there will be still RegAsm.exe running in background and preventing my monitor to sleep. I also checked in task manager, and I can see RegAsm.exe running. When I ended this process, my monitor went to sleep after locking computer, but it came back on in few minutes. Once again RegAsm.exe was running.
 Anyone experienced same problem like me? Any suggestions how to check what's actually using this process and how to get rid of it for good?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 I had a question I wanted to know if anyone had the answer to regarding the New Outlook Desktop. 
 We upgrade our client’s Outlook Desktop client to the new version of Outlook, which looks more like the web version. The reason was that they use Google Gsuite for emailing, and for some reason, their Gmail account wasn’t connecting properly with Outlook desktop. However, they have multiple email accounts and are used to be able to drag emails from folders in one account to a folder in another account. However, with New Outlook Desktop, they can’t do that.
 So my question would anyone know how to do that, or if anyone knows how to fix Outlook Desktop to connect to a Google Guite Gmail account? (Every time we connect it, it says can’t connect to the server and doesn’t sync. But the New Outlook Desktop syncs perfectly.)
 Thank You!!

 We are you usual company. We use AD, File Servers
 Access is controlled by groups. Usual thing every company uses. We have been copying users as is standard and then they complain that they shouldn't have access to something. 
 One of the managers what's a list of each group his staff are a member of to make sure people don't have access they shouldn't. They want it in excel and want us to make sure its up to date. We don't have the time to do it each month and its just another step when creating users. 
 Has anyone done something similar. Ideally don't want to reinvent the wheel if someone has something already used. Ideally I just want it to email him the members of this 50 security groups every month.

 We have a Juniper SSG in production for a location with a routed /26 WAN range from a single ISP. The plan is to change this box since it's old.
 I am having issues mirroring the configuration from the SSG to the new Fortigate box.
 The current setup has one interface for the WAN traffic (lets say 1.2.10.2/26 in zone A), then a second interface with a VLAN400 in zone B (lets say 1.2.10.3/26) using the same WAN IP range as the primary WAN
 When I try to add these two interfaces in a Fortigate, it says there is a conflict and I cannot use the same IP range twice.
 I have read some about VDoms but never used it. Can this be a good solution to the case?
 Thanks

 How long should it be? I always worry about losing my spot at a potential company because some HR person (or AI, or program...) doesn't know that Experience with devices / concepts X Y and Z are the same as A B and C.
 In that regard, my resume ends up spelling out EVERY little detail I do at a job, and has a long list of buzzwords I have experience with.

 When assistant goes to schedule meetings on his behalf and checks his 365 work calendar in Outlook...he's free, but on his personal calendar he's booked. They are not aware and sometimes forget to check his personal and then run into scheduling conflicts.
 He's shared his personal out to his assistants but it's an extra step.
 I suggested he exports Mac Calendar (personal) and imports it into Outlook and then continues only using Outlook. Another solution is that he keeps both separate and just blocks off time in his work email when he's not available due to personal events.
 Is there a way to dynamically sync 2 separate calendars? His assistants just need to know when he's busy but I also like the idea of keeping personal and work stuff separated.
 What's the best solution?

So if there are two controllers, each controller should have a LUN that is no more than 85% the total usable virtual pool space. 
 For those who deploy and maintain internal storage arrays that utilize vSphere components like ESXi and vCenter, is it better to have lots of “little” LUNs for each VM’s hard disk, or is it better to go with my approach? I’m sure there are situations where having a dedicated LUN/datastore is advantageous for VMs such as production MSSQL servers or something.

However, we are forced to change these PRI's to a SIP - IP backbone from our carrier. Outgoing faxes seem to be fine but when we receive outbound faxes, some do succeeded but alot of them fail as well or have cut off pages. 
 I have worked both with Cisco / Xmedius support and they stated that it was the carrier that was having the issues. Our configurations are very simple.
 ​
 We are looking into other solutions and one that was mentioned is to have a dedicated internet sip circuit to service our faxes. I am very new to this and I was wondering if anyone has had issues like this when switching from PRI to SIP and if having a dedicated circuit actually fixed the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is hiring a VP of HR.
 We have a little over 300 staff members. 
 Our pay scale will now be dependent on job title/experience. 
 I report to the VP of Technology, and he's asking me to find a job title. I currently dont have anyone working beneath me, but I will be hiring soon. 
 Currently, these are my duties: - Inventory management/acquisition - helpdesk - license management - azure architect - all things azure/o365 management - IT project planner - IT integration with new acquisitions - IT security - All IT onboarding/offboarding - Sage server oversite (we have a contractor that does the work) - Define IT hardware standards for the entire org - Domain management (cloudflare/godaddy) - Entire face of IT for all company announcements, etc. 
 Thoughts?
 Edit: Thanks for the awesome feedback! As exciting as it would be to have a big manager title, I'm going to go with Senior Systems Administrator with 10 years' experience. This will allow me to get "promotion" pay raises instead of "salary" pay raises in the future. I'll go for a manager title next year after I have a team, then IT Director after I have a manager under me and we hit our revenue target. Im still open to hearing your suggestions though, thanks again!

I've been on the board for about 2 weeks consistently, but I feel like the majority of the time I don't understand what I'm doing and need help resolving the issue. It's overwhelming and I feel like I'm in over my head with this role. What are some things you all do to understand systems and troubleshoot better? How long did it take to start feeling comfortable in the role? Additionally, are there roles that aren't helpdesk focused? Preferably in government? The best cert I have is Sec+ and a bachelors from a different field.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going down a seemingly never-ending documentation rabbit hole regarding the command 'match ip route-source'--trying to differentiate it from just match-ip address. While on the search, I came across the statement that BGP doesn't support match ip address on route maps for inbound advertisements. I don't really see how this is true. 
 For example, if I wanted to filter a subset of received additional paths I might say:
 ip prefix-list SelectivePaths permit 10 192.0.2.0/24 route-map ReceivedAdditionalPaths permit 10 match ip address prefix-list SelectivePaths 
 (route-map ReceivedAdditionalPaths deny 20)* maybe unnecessary because of implicit deny
 Router BGP 65001 Neighbor Remote-AS 65001 Neighbor 10.0.0.2 Additional-Paths Receive Neighbor 10.0.0.2 Route-Map ReceivedAdditionalPaths in
 Please assume I meant to make everything but labels lowercase

Is it better to keep going into Network Engineer route, with CCNP, or even CCIE, network automation, etc etc. or to start diversifying to a more “Network Admin” role to grab some Linux, Cloud or general SysAdmin stuff? Things are becoming more and more GUI and automated, do we all see a need to start changing the focus?

And to be honest, it really wasn't a field that I had a lot of knowledge of and wasn't something I ever really looked into while in school.

 I was working half sick and not focused enough and instead of deleting the exchange index file. I deleted the EDB file... is there any way that I can recover it ? I know I made a huge mistake... never happend to me before atleast not something this huge.... Could use some help to see if I can recover it.
 I still have the exchange log files.
 Additional info Update: I have a backup but the latest backup is from last night.
 Update: Currently restoring to last night... Had some issues with the backup portal. Normally an external party does the restores etc.... and its in a different language.. than what I speak... Trying to do a eseutil after that.
 Update 2:
 Restored the database of last night. Performed an Eseutil /r succesfully. Now checking some mailboxes from the db I deleted to see the timestamps of the latest emails.
 Update 3:
 I checked several mailboxes. Timestamps were shown from today so the eseutil recovery was succesfull.
 TLDR: Wasnt paying attention deleted the Mailbox Database. Focused to much on using recovery software to get the database file back instead of using a backup of the night before and rebuilding the database with eseutil with the Exchange logs.
 Got it solved. Thanks for the help guys.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Norwegian National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NO) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to active exploitation of CVE-2023-35078 and CVE-2023-35081. Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2023-35078 as a zero day from at least April 2023 through July 2023 to gather information from several Norwegian organizations, as well as to gain access to and compromise a Norwegian government agency’s network.
Ivanti released a patch for CVE-2023-35078 on July 23, 2023. Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability CVE-2023-35081 and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023. NCSC-NO observed possible vulnerabili…]]></summary>

 I have 2 rackmount APC Smart-UPS. The two Exagrid PSU are connected to the UPS devices. 
 In the Exagrid knowledge base, it is recommended to configure a script with Exagrid Admin credentials for the UPS to trigger the shutdown process on the Exagrid appliance. However, using the Admin credentials in the script poses a significant security risk.
 Any third-party options that I can use that doesn’t require using Exagrid admin credentials?

 I am looking for a program or application where I can save step-by-step tutorials for myself or others, for example, how to configure a particular application/how to do something on Windows.
 I've looked at Docfx, MkDocs, BookStack and the like, but none of them fit me from the looks of them. I tried Notion, but it's too opaque and clumsy in operation for me. I care about freely inserting screenshots, commands and all that to make the documentation as non-IT-user-friendly as possible (emojis?).
 The documentation will be local, while a pretty cool addition would be the ability to "print" in .pdf
 What do you use and do you use it at all?

 Anyone have tips or tricks for fs logix RDS profiles? Randomly we get that message and it takes 10+ minutes to login and after logging in the servers are basically unusable. Have reviewed and adjusted all GPOs, removed servers from GPOs to test. Reviewed all logs. Turned off AV to test. Basically scoured every article I can find and none of the fixes appear to be the issue.
 I thought it may be storage related but we completely isolated our San to a single switch and it just started again.
 Works fine when logging in with local admin. 
 Anyone have suggestions? Thanks!

Our back bone network is Cisco Meraki.
 W11 does not connect to our secure SSID. We get these messages that states: "Continue Connecting? If you expected XXX-Secure in this location, go ahead and connect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just want to finish my breakfast. But I have to hand hold grown ups.
 I got an email two and a half hours before my day starts. They needed a query ran on the production database server for a customer.
 I get on, look at it, and run it. There was one option they were setting to off, but the server they tested on was a different version. So that one setting was skipped over and I let them know. They were just giving it a default from what I could tell. So I told them to let me know if that would be an issue.
 I go sit down to eat my breakfast and boom, Teams message. 
 "There was no error on the dev server when running the query."
 And I'm blinking my eyes thinking, "OK. Fantastistic? It worked on a different server with what probably has a different version of sql and some other setup than prod. What do you want me to do?" I shouldn't need to say that out loud, but I do - as nicely as possible.
 Then they ask,
 "Can we get new data?"
 I was just asked to run a query. 
 So I ask, "What do you mean by "new data"?'
 And they say,
 "You're know, new data."
 And I'm thinking - do they not know what they're asking for and hoping I'll know?
 So I ask,
 "When you say "new data" what data are you referring to and where is this data located?"
 They finally say, "A backup of X and Y database.
 And I put my hand to my forhead and get them the backups...
 And as of right now, my day begins.
 I would have never gotten away with giving as little info as the group below me when I was working that level at my last job. They would have seen it as very unprofessional.amd inconsiderate.

I work remotely for a startup now which seems to be growing steadily making 100k. A recruiter reached out to me about a position for a company that was in a space I was interested in learning. I have been working in my career 3 years, 4 next January. I've had 1 job 1 year and my current job 2 years.
 Here are the facts for the position:
 DevSecOps position
 Can work Remote
 3 month contract 180k-250k prorated, which would equal out to $45,000-$62,500
 They say they are strongly looking to extend, but I'm not taking this into account much outside of they don't plan to shut down after 3 months
 I know I have to pay my own healthcare, and I believe taxes are paid differently (quarterly?) 
 I would also like to buy a house in 2 years, I am about 29k away from a down payment. Will look for standard 40hr, stable jobs after reaching this goal

I've checked the computers for malware and anything strange, but everything looks pretty ordinary.

My coworkers are unaware of their product's use on campus. 
 The email contained a "one time use" download for the upgraded installer and instructions and they suggest installing it against our Canvas installation buy entering a site id. At first I thought it was our security folks and their phishing/scam email tests, but it appears to be from Pearson. I am posting basically because if it is a play to get their foot into the door, it is not appreciated. This is the first time I've had an email from a vendor which blindly sent software to install against an existing application, has anyone else seen this?
 I'm torn between responding, breaking my rule of referring sales to other internal people, and ignoring, but their tactic has created a situation where I am feeling unsure. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Small office (10 people) with a mix of laptop and desktops, all fully-updated Win10Pro. The printer is a Lexmark XM7155 copier, about 7-8 years old. It has a static IP on the network.
 Computers are configured with it as a network printer and it works great - until it doesn't. Occasionally (couple times a month), someone will lose the ability to print. They try to print a document, the printer makes the usual noises (fans coming on as it wakes from sleep, etc), but nothing comes out. The computer thinks it sent the document, so there's nothing left in the queue. 
 The only fix I've found is to remove the printer device from their computer and re-add it as a network printer. Only takes a moment, but it's a pain since usually they printed a bunch of stuff before noticing that nothing came out and now they have to figure out what they tried to print. 
 Given that remove/readd on the computer fixes it, I think it's a driver/windows issue rather than the printer itself. However, it only happens to 2 users. All the rest of the office has never had this happen. It's possible that it's just because they're heavier printer users, but not sure. 
 Any ideas of where to bang my head on next? I've tried installing the full Lexmark printer driver, but that takes FOREVER and doesn't help. Now I just add it as a network printer from the Windows add device process, put in the IP address, and let Windows use a basic printer driver. It's quicker and doesn't seem to matter. 
 update: hm, I'm not sure if I've tried just restarting the spooler service. Next time they have a failure I'll try that.

 At first glance, VRRP appeared to be the total solution - hardware + ISP/WAN redundancy. However, I learned that I was wrong in that assumption after a bit more reading. VRRP is only intended for router failure, not downstream route failure.
 What is the best option here? Ideally, we want gateway failover AND WAN failover.
 I have to look into this further, obviously, but my first assumption is that each device in a VRRP group could be configured to use either ISP. If gateway1 fails, gateway2 takes over and/or if either device loses its connection on one of its WAN ports, it uses the other. Is this the correct thinking?

 If we run them in 8 core is that licensed as 8 cores or is it 12? I can't find any guidance on this.
 All of the other 8 core CPUs are either trash (bronze) or wildly overpriced.

 I’m experiencing an issue where the default printer mapped via group policy either fails to apply at logon or if it maps correctly at logon, the printer reverts back to the Microsoft printer for PDF within 1 or 2 hours. I’m having this issue on Windows virtual desktop. Anyone had a similar issue and got to the bottom of it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have been thinking about the configuration of patching our servers with WSUS in a new enviroment as we've configured WSUS to use SQL server for the DB.
 Our WSUS server is using a SQL server database for the susdb instance. the SQL server is a separate server.
 WSUS is applying updates to all of our servers automatically on a Saturday, this includes the SQL server where the susdb is running. I am wondering what will happen with WSUS when the SQL server is rebooting after the monthly updates are installed while WSUS services are still running? Is WSUS able to run without a DB connection for the time that the SQL server is offline or will it get into error state and potentially ruin the update cycle (reports)?
 Been searching the web on this topic but have not found what I am looking for, hopefully some of you can help me out.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm interested to know how you are informing your new users of their initial password. Currently new users are automatically created using a powershell script which pulls data from our HR system. This contains the users mobile phone number, so we send them a TXT telling them to collect a password scratch card from IT, with a specific number so we know which card to give them. They also have to show some photo ID.
 The problem is that our site spans multiple cities, so not everyone is local to our department, and some staff work remotely, so can't come in. In these cases, we are sending the password over email to their line manager, who can verify over the phone......not ideal.
 any clever ways to do this?
 Thanks

 We are about to deploy 1Gbps FTTP internet for a number of small office locations. The supplier provides a ONT device with a /32 static IP for us to plumb into our firewall.
 We would generally use a Unifi UDM with a couple of APs, but looking for an all in one very basic router with WiFi for circa 5-10 users. 
 Can anyone recommend a router that can actually handle 1Gbps throughput at a fairly cost effective price? We're looking for something sub £100.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We love to advertise 6 9's uptime and it's even in the contracts with customers. That's just under 3 seconds a month. Of course an application running on nearly 4000 servers that's sharing infrastructure with 1500 other applications, connects to 3rd party SAAS stuff, with some of the code nearly 20 years old, originally written to run on AIX and HP3000s, ported multiple times, and gets nearly 1000 updates a month is no where near 99.9999%. But our lawyers are crafty and write the contracts with an incredibly narrow scope for what defines 6 9's. Our IT metrics for SLA only look at a very narrow part of the system so we can say it's the Internet or 3pp if (when) a customer complains we missed SLA. We've got elaborate monitoring setup to provide evidence to customers when they push the issue to show them it's not the system. Of course real SLA at the edge would be closer to 99.99%
 I really get tired of having to do that and just wish they'd let us start building a replacement. But the pay is good and as long we need to keep adding Band-Aids I have a job.
 Btw we are a financial company where if you use any banking services in the North America, EU, Middle East, or Australia it's almost guaranteed some of your money passes through our systems. Crap now I'm getting pissed thinking how much of our world's finances is running on shaky decades old software. And I don't even want to start thinking about my time working at a large hospital network.
 You gotta wonder how the Internet actually still works and hasn't imploded on itself. We need an international sysadmins holiday (and only if it comes with a paid day off).

Most enterprise firewall appliances would melt under the load of even a medium-sized ISP and it doesn't seem practical to implement this at the core (for performance reasons). 
 Do they do it on lower tier and/or edge routers? Doing it on edge routers would obviously complicate the rule set, as they probably want exclusions for their own mail servers, leading to more performance degradation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm solo sysadmin at a 90 user company. We don't have any on-premise infrastructure, and it feels like a lot of the popular security solutions are still focussed on legacy. All our users are remote. Mix of Linux and Windows.
 In terms of tools, we have:
  
Antivirus - Cybereason EDR
 SIEM - Wazuh
 PAM - Admin By Request
 Password management - Keeper Security
 Vulnerability scanning - Tenable.io
 Patching - Endpoint Central
 IAM - JumpCloud
 Backup of our SaaS platforms, where possible.
  
Other than tools, I have:
  
asset register
 information security policies, incident response plan
 GDPR / cyber security training annually
 device encryption for all endpoints
 VPN for all endpoints (to a VPN provider, rather than to infrastructure. This is used only to mitigate risks of public / home wifi, and to provide static IP for some IP locked SaaS platforms).
 removable media blocked
 no local admin for any user
 IT risk register
 MFA is a requirement of any SaaS we use
  
I feel like I'm covering the basics, but is there anything obvious I'm missing?
 Also, I worry that I'm maybe using too many products, and there might be some consolidation that should be done. Can anyone suggest any of the tools that might be merged?
 Perhaps phishing training is something that is needed? 
 Without meaning to sound a dick, it seems like there's a lot of FUD in the cybersecurity world, with some rather shady sales tactics that make me feel inadequate for taking a risk based approach - I even had one vendor ask some rather rude "how will you sleep at night if you don't buy MDR from us?" questions.
 So, I'm interested for opinions from people who actually run systems similar to mine.

 So my question is, from your experience, how often does this really happen? So what's like the typical business profile of customers that would want to do this? Like perhaps two financial institutions doing high-frequency trading (HFT)?

 Having a pretty strange networking issue in work. We have a Unifi set up in the office consisting of a core switch (USW-Pro-48), and four distribution switches (USW-Pro-48 x3, USW-48-G2). All four distribution switches are using the core switch as an uplink. Recently, only one of the distribution switches has been indicating a broadcast storm (All in use port lights are flashing in unison). I have RSTP enabled on all switches, using the core switch as the root bridge. I tried checking the RSTP port statuses on all of the switches to see if one port was set to "blocked", but no luck. However, the single distribution switch is still indicating a storm. 
 I read that taking a Wireshark capture of the network will help locate the source of the of the storm but that seems to be as in depth as most of the tutorials tend to go. Does anybody know if there is any way to locate the source using a Wireshark capture? Appreciate any help!

 Recalling an email through outlook with exchange appears to have changed recently, previously you'd recall an email and then get an email telling you whether it succeeded or not, what time and date and who to and the subject.
 Now when recalling an email you receive an email with a link to "View Message Recall Report".
 This works fine when sending from your own mailbox, but we use distribution lists as "Role addresses" so for example ["departmentA@email.com](mailto:"department@email.com)" for department A that everyone in that department can send from and receive. A colleague of mine recently recalled an email and then was unable to access the message recall report. I also tested this, and also tested with a shared mailbox as well since we have a few shared mailboxes, and was unable to view the message recall report it just states the following:
 An error occurred while processing your request
 An error has occurred while trying to access this message recall report. Possible reasons include the following:
 The recall was requested by someone else and you don't have permissions to view their report.
 The report can't be accessed since it has been expired.
 A technical glitch occurred. Please try again later.
 Does anyone know how to get around this or how else to recall an email so my users can tell whether an email was successfully recalled or not?
 Thank you, and please ask if anymore information is needed.

 We are looking in to introducing an application between our backend application and the load balancer for granular rate limiting.
 We want to perform rate limiting based on request params (in the POST body) before the requests reach the backend servers. 
 Nginx/Openresty is one we have worked with before but was wondering if you guys have other recommendations.
 Google search gives Traefik as a solution as well. But would like to know if anyone had better (or worse) experiences with other solutions.
 It will be hosted on AWS ECS, so a docker ready solution is preferable and also with a dashboard for adjusting the limits.

 The fiber modem sets the IP lease at 24 hours and we can’t change it. We also can’t change any subnets or do supernetting. Mostly everyone connects thru TP link access points.
 We have 1 Cat6 cable that is about 200 ft long connected to a small unmanaged TPLink switch and there are 4 Cat6 cables connected to that switch, each also about +200ft long connected to TPLink switches. Wired TPLink access points connect to all the switches.
 Slow network issue...Would replacing the long Cat6 cables with fiber help with the slow network issues?
 IP address issue… What decently priced modem/router/switch would allow us to do vlans and possibly have fiber ports if needed?

 Now I want to know which process or application started the connection.
 I know the source IP, the source port, the name of the endpoint, but I cant find which process started that connection. Is this logged in the event viewer?
 Or is there a way to view netstat historical data.

 We have some users that are using Starlink as their internet service. When checking the sign in logs through Azure we can see they are signing in from the "US" (usually its more precise than this i.e which state). IP address shows as being provided by SpaceX.
 Is there a way other than removing the geo block we have set up for these users that we can allow the "spaceX" isp addresses?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a Netgate sg-1100 and am in the process of creating a custom HTML captive portal. I have everything finished and it works great when I am connected to the device admin portal using a browser. But as soon as I close the browser, the captive portal is no longer live. All traffic that connects is no longer is routed to the captive portal but instead is just connected to the network.
 I'm really new to this but can the sg-1100 host the captive portal, or do I need another piece of hardware to run it? I thought sg-1100 would download the html file that I uploaded to pfsense and would use that to keep the portal running.
 Thanks for any advice!

The caller asked for the employee by name and also mentioned our organisation by name. In all cases the next of kin refused, and when they attempted to get the caller to identify himself, he hung up. He also called our finance team's office number and did identify himself and his company, asking again for the finance manager by name, which the team refused.
 At first we thought this could be some kid of vishing attempt or other attack, but checking the email archive showed that he'd emailed the finance manager and CFO requesting a meeting/demo. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wondering how you guys have handled issues like this, I'm hoping I can at least turn it Into a learning experience:
 Long story short: company I work at has an old 25 year old phone system
 Legacy relic of a previous IT team.
 It is so out of service that even the vendors cant help, I traced the originating company through four company buy outs, they have a record of us purchasing the system but nothing else. 
 Basically we have no support and will be moving to teams telephony, - but typically the phone system has now fallen over, a week before teams telephony go live ....
 Ive power cycled the main unit, checked all our switches, etc i do t see anything causing it here 
 It's also worth noting it was fine on Friday, come in Monday morning its down, but I'm the only one with access to the server room and rack keys
 I contacted our ISP, as its doesnt appear to be anything on our end, but that's more or less all I can do. 
 Contacting our ISP, they said any issue was on our end.. 
 but we have no documentation, no access to any kind of management system (not that that would help much with all the handsets dead)
 And of course even people who know full well my position, what I've tried, etc and that ive done what i can, are still messaging me saying: is it fixed yet?? 
 I'm not a magician, I guess my question is how do I respond to people saying is it sorted yet, in a way that they understand I cannot fix it, without being rude, or sounding incompetent.. I'm just trying to push the new phone system install forward at the moment..

 I am not sure why or where BIND is filtering these records. I haven't specified any such filters. Infact, the only record that works is AAAA when queried over the IPv6 address of the server.

 Somewhat long winded, but I don't think it breaks rule 2 (I'm not advertising, I'm asking), but if mods disagree, please do the needful and remove.
 DM's are fine in response if you don't want to break rule 2 - I have no problem with messages rather than comment replies.
 Our company is based in Australia, but we have numerous staff and office in North America (US and Canada) that we purchase Laptops/PC's, servers0 and other hardware - networking, accessories and stuff - for and have shipped to homes and offices.
 We've been using CDW in both the US and Canada, and while our initial work with them (based on recommendations people here made) were OK - recent interactions and service have, quite frankly, sucked. We've had five different "account managers" in the US in the last 4 weeks (and probably 6 or 7 in the last 18 months), and we've decided to take our business elsewhere.
 I'm reaching out to the greater Reddit hive mind to see if anyone has recommendations for general vendors - I don't care if I have to use a different one in the US and Canada - who would be able to reliably provide product like this.
 We're mainly a HP shop for PC type gear- so experience with HP/HPE kit would be good - and Juniper for network kit, so likewise, Juniper experience would be great.
 We're not looking for something geographic specific - we ship to locations all over the US and Canada (yay for remote work!), but we do need vendors in both countries owing it being so fricking expensive to buy in the US and ship to Canada (or vica-versa).
 Anyone willing to share their "go to" vendor of choice for up north?
 thanks
 Edit : Have several suggestions I have passed on and will reach out to. Thanks heaps to everyone who replied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, ran into this problem: 
 I am putting together a lab work, configuring the interface on a virtual router which is directly connected to a virutal laptop. I assign an address with a /30 mask, then test the connectivity. There is no connectivity. I start checking what the problem is and find the following:
 From the virtual router the address that should be assigned to the laptop is reachable, then I check ARP and see:
 RTR-A#sh arp int e0/2 Protocol Address Age (min) Hardware Addr Type Interface Internet 172.16.99.1 - aabb.cc00.1020 ARPA Ethernet0/2 Internet 172.16.99.2 - aabb.cc00.1020 ARPA Ethernet0/2
 How can two addresses from the same subnet be assigned on the same interface?
 And the interface is configured like this:
 RTR-A#sh run int e0/2 Building configuration...
 Current configuration : 144 bytes ! interface Ethernet0/2 description AdminPC ip address 172.16.99.1 255.255.255.255.252 ip nat inside ip virtual-reassembly in duplex auto end
 Clearing the ARP table on the interface doesn't help, turning it off/on doesn't help either. Tried different images (IOL and VIOS) and everywhere the same problem. I can't understand why this happens. I tried restoring the default network adapter settings in the hypervisor and that didn't help either. In the end I completely uninstalled EVE, then VMWare Workstation, cleaned the system of all possible hypervisor related files. Then I reinstalled everything, uploaded the images (different ones) and got the same problem. Please help me. 
 What can this be due to? And how to fix it?

 “Cannot connect to realm. Messages returned: (For identity policies) The connection test has failed. (For RA VPN authentication) ERROR: Authentication Server not responding.”
 I ran a Test-NetConnection on the LDAPS Port 636 on my laptop which returned successfully. I installed our domain’s CA certificate on the firewall. 
 When I entered the CLI, I couldn’t ping the domain controller but I’m wondering if that’s due to some ACLs going on.
 Any suggestions? Thanks, guys.
 Edit: Correct DNS server is in the firewall as well as a static route. We have a site-to-site VPN that has an ACL tied to it that allows traffic. Connecting to this DC is through the tunnel and to the other site.
 Edit: ACLs essentially allow all traffic outbound. Blocks everything else.

 The reason I mentioned chuckling is I was laid off on 2017 and got to play musical chairs with my career over the past 4 years before finally landing in another stable job and every place has a senior leader who came back from a convention or call and all of the sudden SRE was the hot topic while everyone went on about their day doing what they always do.
 For me I'm just hoping for an extra 20% or so pay raise for this fancy new title. (I can laugh at that too)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All,
 Currently working for a small ISP/Data company and decided to take on a small side project. Looking for a solution (Free or Paid) that can do the following,
  
Provide info on ports, whether they are open/closed. If they can provide more information beyond open/closed then that is a plus. SIP ports, H323, RTP, Inspections, etc.
 
Analyze VOIP traffic 
 
Test and monitor network connections. 
 
 Main purpose of this tool is to make it easier for us to determine if the customer's network is ready for VOIP deployment and to assist with troubleshooting (for example, one way audio, packet loss, jitter, etc). 
 Our plan is to either deploy a small NUC device onto the customer site or install a program (that is potentially controlled by a satellite master program). 
 Windows or Linux, doesn't matter.
 Any ideas? So far I've looked at LibreNMS, Voipmonitor, Homer, PRTG, or a combination of some of the ones I've mentioned.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I will try to make a long story short
 Joined a company, no other IT member on board, little to no documentation on the companies infrastructure, 2 seperate buildings connected with a ~50meters single duplex fiber cable
 After some weeks of learning the network, the fibre connection between the buildings goes dark The (super old HP) uplink switch with the fibre transceiver died. Swapped both switches on both ends out but the old transceiver weren't useable in my new switches
 Throwing in new 850nm 10GBase-SR SFP+ transceivers that I have plenty in stock since that's what we use everywhere else, but still no connection Called an electrician, comes in and checks the fiber. He shows me an OTDR protocol which states: OM3 G50/125, distance test 200meters, 1300nm successfull
 I asked the electrician if he can also check for 850nm but he said his OTDR module can only do 1300nm on multimode fiber
 I checked the old transceivers and they are original HP 1310nm SFP+
 Is it possible that 850nm on an OM3 isn't working while 1300nm is working? I run this setup everywhere else with the exception that everything else connected this way is directly patched, like server to switch or switch to switch without walled cables
 Any ideas whats going on here? I'm willing to buy new 1310nm transceivers for me current switches but I want to understand what the issue is here
 Edit: after the HP switch died, I used 2 Arubas with genuine Aruba 850nm transceivers
 since they didn't work I tried 2 different switch models from FS.com, but those would also not get a link with included 850nm transceivers
 all transceivers would show up on the switches as working but disconnected, direclty connecting them with a OM3 patchcable worked so the issue has to be the walled OM3 cable between the buildings

 My point is to put a focus at cybersecurity standpoint of what would be the pros and cons of each architectural scenario, considering that main objective is to secure the company from cybersecurity threats as ransomwares, data exfiltrations, DDOS, etc...all attacks which can have impacts on confidentiality, availability and integrity. 
 Furthermore, I want to check what are the key differences between security at edge for velocloud devices in comparison with fortinet/palo alto firewalls as I understood in SD-WAN edges we can have firewall rules configurations, IPS/IDS ...
 My point is not to get theoretical information but more in the field experience, and how in terms of design we can get the best from each type of SD-WAN architectures and solutions.
 Thanks very much and if there are any additional information you require do not hesitate so that this post is interesting for everyone working on same topics !

 Im back again with real world BGP questions in real world application. 
 So Ive recently connected to an internet exchange, I`ve learned prepending, local pref and weight on manipulating the paths. Right now, Im connected in the IX, connected with the its route servers but droping all learned routes and only allowing BILATERAL PEERS prefixes to my network. I went this way because I dont really need other routes besides those handpicked organizations such as FACEBOOK, TWITCH etc, just the usual useful cdns in ISP environment. This IX recently connected GOOGLE and it takes a lot of time requesting for BILATERAL PEERING with google, so meanwhile, I would only like to create a filter from route servers to only accept prefixes from specific AS. 
 So my only question is, is COMMUNITIES the only way to achieve this? or is there something Im missing that will make my life easier with what I wanna accomplish?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With regards to hardwired (Cat 5/6) Ethernet connections, with IPv4 it was possible keep track of which device had which IPv4 address because DHCP(v4) was basically mandatory for any useful IPv4 connectivity.
 With IPv6, we now have SLAAC where when the link-layer connection goes active, the device can assign itself an address with some link-layer packets without having to necessarily contact central infrastructure.
 Do vendors have any mechanisms to (centrally?) record which MAC address has which IPv6 address? Especially with privacy addresses that expire/rotate regularly? Or, if this tracking is desired/needed, is it strictly necessary to go with DHCPv6 and not allow SLAAC (except for link-local fe80)?
 (With Wifi there is 802.1X, and that's technically possible for wired Ethernet, I'm just wondering if there is anything more 'simple' or light weight with regards to 'just' plugging in.)

I've seen that RADIUS authenticates via TELNET in this case and I use SSH for ADMIN user when RADIUS fails, right? Or can I do both via SSH? Radius via SSH and when radius is down, activate the admin user. 
 EDIT: I'VE GOT THE SOLUTION -
 I will leave my documentation for anyone wants it :D from the SWITCH SIDE
 config
 aaa authentication login RadLogin local radius
 aaa authentication enable RadEnable enable radius
 radius-server host IP-RADIUS-SERVER
 key passwordSetOnRadiusServer
 radius-server source-ip IP-SWITCH
 exit
 line ssh
 login authentication RadLogin
 enable authentication RadEnable
 so, thats all. When you want to login with radius you just : domain\user
 when you want to log in with admin: admin

 currently right now we enforce a 15 minute lock on all health stations by default and a 30 minute lock on some special stations like shared operatory PCs because of the high number of complaints of doctors getting locked out in the middle of a procedure (completely understandable). The argument was made (and won) that all operatory stations are behind locked doors and that there "should" be no danger of exposing PII or PHI except to other healthcare staff.
 to streamline this more we are about to transition these into MEM/Intune policies with some device filters to separate that 15 minute PCs and 30 minute PCs.
 I'm just curious overall how complex people get with screen lock policies like this or if it really should just be this simple.

I've pointed a domain and firewall at the IP address I'm using. But I'm getting some errors, I'm thinking its nginx configuration but I'm really not sure what to search and where to start trouble shooting it.
 I put in sudo gunciron website.wsgi and it says listening at http://192.168.1.249:80 (8904), booting worker with pid: 8905.
 That IP is routed correctly through the firewall at the DNS.
 But when I check the systemctl status nginx its not binding and says "Failed to start a high performance web server and a reverse proxy server."
 All I've been able to find online says it means the port is in use and to shut them down and then restart but had no effect.
 Anyone able to give me some idea of what to research/look up, or know of an extremely beginner level nginx tutorial? This is my first foray into anything server related and I've done no configuration of nginx. My boss usually does our networking but he's too busy at the moment and has dropped it on me to figure out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone. Hoping for a little guidance where possible.
 My company recently paided for a leased line (fibre) to be installed as the standard broadband is a terrible 30mb up 10mb down. The vendor has sent a Cisco 1100 4P Router which we assumed would connect to an Unifi AP AC PRO and broadcast a staff and guest SSIDs to the site. Its only a small office with <10 staff and visitors at max so the fibre was purely to improve speeds.
 Now the issue - They configure the device and turned off DHCP on the router so there is only 1 port active that needs a static IP. The AP AC PRO can be configured with the static IP but won't issue IPs from DHCP. They have disabled the ports and DHCP for "security purposes".... I have asked for more info about why they can't enable it.
 Looks like I need to setup another Router with static info to connect to this Router but has anyone else had a Vendor do this? Also what Routers have you used for small businesses that would fit this scenario?

 I don't want to go into all the details, I know about DFS, I know I can use secondary UNC names, but I need both server to respond to their original names... but redirect the share.
 I know this is a long shot as I have been doing a lot of investigating over this... but I figure it's worth a shot someone might know how to accomplish this.
 Let's say I have Server1, it host applications and a file share. The file share is being moved to Server2. The problem I am facing is the application on Server 1 is accessed using the server name (so that server name cannot change and needs to remain). The file share is mapped via GPO, but there are numerous links/pinned folders to that share done via the UNC path (due to the way some of their applications function and end users being end users).
 Is there anyway that I can have \\Server1\File Share "redirect" to \\Server2\File Share? (like with symbolic links or something). Keep in mind, DFS won't help, adding a secondary UNC name to Server2 can't happen (because Server 1 needs to be accessed for an application).
 I am going to be rolling this out as DFS moving forward, but that won't help me in this instance.
 As I said, I did Google, Search Reddit, Spiceworks, etc... It sounds like I am doomed, but you never know :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some recommendations that would fit our current system:
 Instead of shipping devices straight to new users, our IT department sets up the autopilot devices and does a few post-enrolment checks and updates before shipping out to site. 
 We create the user accounts with a password and use this to sign in initially. We then setup WHfB using a PIN and our own mobile number, then change the authentication number to the new users phone number. We don’t provide the password to the users - part of our post enrolment tasks is to ensure all apps are logged in correctly. 
 This works very well for us and whilst improvements can and should be made so we don’t have to do this setup, management are not looking to change this anytime soon. 
 What falls down is when an existing user needs a replacement device and we need to log in on a new laptop. We have to reset the password which causes disruption to the end user as they are prompted for their new password on their current laptop and phone, which we then have to tell them - what we were actively avoiding in the first place. 
 From what I’ve read, a temporary access pass only works for enrolment and isn’t a solution for the end users existing laptop and phone in this situation. 
 Is there any solution to this where the end user doesn’t know and isn’t required to enter in a password? IT knowing the passwords for users isn’t a concern. 
 (I’m aware this is not close to best practice in any means, but management are unfortunately only looking for a solution to minimise the end user disruption at this point)

 I was wondering if any of you have experienced the following:
 If a user in AD -> (Synced to AAD using AADconnect) -> has logged into a computer, then the user is later deleted. Then a while in the future the user starts at the company again with the same information on the AD account the computer(s) the user logged into pre-deletion starts acting up when the user logs in. This includes a long "Please wait while we're setting up the device", and when that ends the user is met with a flashing taskbar and constant explorer.exe crashes.
 I can reproduce this by creating a user in AD -> waiting for sync from connect -> logging into a computer -> Deleting the user from AD and the perma delete from AAD(To avoid waiting times) -> Recreating the user -> Logging into the computer again -> Results in the problem above. I am unable to see anything of meaningful in event viewer, but that could just be that im looking in the wrong places.
 This does not happen if the user is directly created in AAD.
 The issues usually goes away if the user profile on the device is deleted, but not all the time. A fresh start will guarantee the issue to go away since everything on the device gets removed, hence user profile is fully gone.
 However, as we use a fair bit of shared device a user may end up logging into 10s of devices, which can be quite the cleanup job to get the user fully working again on all the computers he/she might use. 
 Any suggestions to solve this without going through deleting the user profiles pr. device? :)

 We use Fortigates to do this for MPLS customers wanting breakout and it works great but the limitation is that each MPLS customer has their own VDOM. This works well but in the case where you had 1000's of individual customers it becomes impractical and expensive to give each home user their own VDOM. 
 You could put it all under one VDOM of course but then you lose the ability for each customer to manage their own filtering. 
 Can anyone think of an ISP which offers this type of solution and if so do you know what manufacturers they use for this solution?

 - Route tickets to groups 
 - Only allow agents to see tickets within X Group or only tickets assigned to the agent.

But the sideband packets (same src, dst IPs - different UDP dest port) gets dropped on the switchport the encoder is connected to.
 We've checked the switch logs, they don't show the level of detail to see packets getting dropped.
 We can port mirror the encoder port and see that the packets are definitely arriving at the encoder port & port mirror the decoder port and see that the packets are definitely not arriving at the decoder port.
 We've checked the encoder port interface to see the rate at which dropped packets increments and it is consistent with how often the sideband packets are being sent.
 so all and all it's pretty conclusive that our switch is dropping specific packets and we have no clue why... any suggestions??
 It's a Fortinet Switch btw - the connections work fine on other brands of switches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've been troubleshooting for quite some time now, but I've hit a roadblock. I hope someone can provide additional ideas to help me resolve this issue.
 Here's the situation:
 In our IT department, we've moved approximately 140 VMs from one VM cluster to a new one as part of a hardware replacement.
 For some unknown reason, the C: drive of several random VMs has completely filled up after the move. Upon inspecting the C: drives, it seems that the "C:\Windows\WinSXS\Temp\InFlight" directory has suddenly consumed all available space on some VMs, taking up more than 80GB.
 Here's what I've tried so far:
 - Running the Disk Cleanup tool (cleanmgr.exe) and selecting all available options in the GUI.
 - Executing all possible WinSXS cleanup commands, such as "schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\StartComponentCleanup"", "Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup", "Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase", and "Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded".
 - Restarting the system multiple times.
 Despite these attempts, I've been unable to reduce the size or get rid of these files. I'm at a loss as to why they were created, especially at such a size, and why only some random VMs were affected.
 I would truly appreciate any additional insights or suggestions on what I could try to resolve this issue. Please note that extending the C: drive is not an option.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

 I set up a windows 2019 server as a shared printer server, active directory env on prem.
 So local network.
 The main issue is this.
 I want to install a printer by typing \\SERVER-PRINT in file explorer, then doubleclick the printer i want to install, because users do not have admin priviliges, windows should pop out the admin account request, but this never happen.
 If i try to install a printer with a user wich has admin priv it works fine.
 Should i EDIT some Group Policy in order to install the printers?

 Just wondered if anyone had any specifics you could point to from MS regarding issues when licensing 365 across borders. MS provide "multi-geo" which is related to cross-continent stuff, but i'm not sure whether they care or can do anything about us in the UK selling licenses into a tenant to be used in France or Germany for example? This all stems from one of our customers wanting to consolidate companies across (first) the European region and possibly later globally, and I'd like to know of any pitfalls? (or does MS not care because everything is linked to the dollar?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who are programmatically pulling data from your network devices, how are you doing it so that you get structured data back?
 I'm currently in a mixed vendor environment where everyone manually SSHs to all of our network devices and I'd like to build out tools for us to do that programmatically. Some of the devices are newer arista devices, others are much older cisco devices like 3700s. 
 I understand that I can use tools like nornir and netmiko to connect to devices, but even using Netmiko's TextFSM feature, I don't always get structured data back. (For example, using netmiko to connect to an arista device and running the command "show version" will return structured data, but running the command "show interface et5" will not return structured data. I really want to be able to pull out values like CRC errors or light levels and other smaller things.
 I've looked into NETCONF, but it looks like a nightmare of a learning curve. I understand that I need to figure out what yang model I need based off of what OS I'm running and it's not entirely clear what model I need to use if I want to get a specific value or the output of everything that I'd normally see by running a command manually in the CLI. 
 To add to this, all API capable devices running in our network have their APIs turned off and I understand I'd want to use HTTPS, but I don't know what would be involved in setting this up for every device across our network. I've read that it's not recommended to run HTTP for APIs in a prod environment for security, and that self-signed certs from the device also aren't recommended, but I'm not sure how I'd get external certs for our internal devices. The management plane is in its own internal VRF though, so maybe it's not needed?
 Just feeling a little overwhelmed about how to approach this problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I hope you are doing great.
 Nowadays, which are the best and most recommended external storage options to have a complete backup of personal cloud (Google Drive or OneDrive) considering frequency to upload data can be each 2 weeks or monthly. The main goal is to not going under risk to loose personal data from the cloud provider, since I was a victim of this in the past by Google when they removed several photo albums (and their contents), I opened a support request asking for reason and to recover and in the end I lost everything they removed suddenly without a reason and explanation to me as a customer who pay annual subscription. So, after that irrecoverable damage, I will migrate all cloud data (mainly from Drive and Photos) to MS OneDrive (I have M365 Personal subscription). I'm IT Pro by 25 years, however, I don't buy any external storage a long time ago, so I'm not updated to the newest tech available and don't know the major advantages and disadvantages comparing HDD with SSD for instance to achieve this goal. Based on some articles which I read, for backup it seems HDD is better and recommended than SSD because the HDD lifetime is greater and more secure, but I have doubts. I don't care about the transfer speed because the data transfer frequency will be low. It's crucial to have a mirror of the data in case of any problems in cloud provider (MS in this case) and to not run in risk to loose my data again. I was thinking in buy 2.5" size (portable models) with between 1 and 5TB of space and manufactures as Seagate and Western Digital.
 What are your recommendations, tips and advices to do the the best buying taking into considerations the factors and goal above?
 Thanks in advance! 
 Kind regards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey yall,
 I have a very challenging task ahead that's been hard nut to crack for few months now. We are running Google Workspace with JumpCloud. JC was added-on due to the absolutely abysmal feature set in Google Workspace even though we run on their most expensive plan.
 One of our goals in terms of security is to allow access to Google Mail, Drive, Slack and few other SSO apps only from corporate devices - computers and mobile devices.
 We tried achieving this with Google's Context Aware access but the results were inconsistent as the user's had to keep re-syncing the plugin from Chrome to keep their devices compliant.
 We also trialed the Conditional Access feature-set from JumpCloud but it failed because they don't cover mobile devices so by default all mobiles are forbidden even if enrolled in JC's MDM.
 We have a dispersed user population and most work from home so its a real struggle to organise this via Proxy/Mandatory VPN etc. in my opinion.
 What would be your angle to tackle this if it was your project? Maybe I am too narrowly focused and missing something obvious as solution or approach...
 Thanks in advance!

 What do you mean SINCE THURSDAY? Like we haven't both been in the office that day and Friday. I immediately wonder why we didn't get a central notification, but thank fuck after investigating it was only a browser notification from a website (she accepted and kept getting) and she didn't actually fuck anything up.
 Even in 2023 people are just oblivious to security, no matter how many phishing tests we do, how many posters we have with our 10 golden safety rules etc. Cybersafety is just not on their minds at all.

 First, sorry for my english, I will try to be as clear as possible.
 Where I work, Security installed several intercoms. Some of them are outside next to a barrier.
 Intercoms installed outside are connected with a RJ-45 cable which is going in the closest network bay avalaible. This wasn't a choice. Nobody adsked. they just did. I remember one of my network courses saying everything outside or between buildings should be connectd with optical fiber.
 Several months ago, we were hit by a lighting. We lost 3 intercoms which were outside. 
 In a barrier, we have 2 intercoms connected with POE modules and everything comes inside on a switch. We changed the modules. We changed the intercoms. 
 They randomly loose network. I can't ping them but for whatever reason, they can come back online later. I dediced to monitor them and I clearly a lot of disconnections. 
 ​
 the only we didn't change, is the RJ-45 cable. I'm really wondering if it could be damaged somehow. Could it be possible the lighting damaged it ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working from home for over 10 years. Very lucky, I know. Anyway, would it be crazy to just move overseas without telling my company? I already have teammates in different time zones and overseas anyway. 
 I really don’t think anyone would notice except that I would be online a few hours earlier. (Moving from Texas to Portugal). 
 I think my manager would be OK with it but since I’m close to retirement, I don’t want to give them a reason to boot me out early.

What makes a good or bad VAR other than whether the rep is easy/pleasant to work with?

 since even this dinosaur needs to move on eventually when it makes sense, how do you get started in Azure for example without really needing it? I guess I'd sign up , pay for 1 user and then... do what? sync AD to azure? (only if they don't charge per user ha)
 what is there to do to lab test it and play around without moving anything critical to them just yet? spin up a server for something or other? Please throw some ideas at me, I could use the motivation.

 I run a cluster within a Bladesystem c7000 chassis. I am have a single Brocade 16gb/28 port san switch which would hypothetically allow me to connect 16 blades in the chassis to a external san fabric. Unfortunately, the base config of this switch comes with 16 ports licenses... which means i can connect all the blades, but I can't use any of the external ports to connect out into the network. 
 Any ideas how to go about getting a now discontinued POD license? Fohdeesha's forum isn't for my model unfortunately :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I'm trying to introduce high availability for a couple servers via BGP using BIRD on an rpm based linux distro.
 I followed the guide here from vultr and I have successfully got BGP working and pinging the BGP shared IP works with failover flawlessly. But I'm running into an issue as the server still initiates connections from the instance IP, not the shared, BGP IP. 
 EX:
 server-1 - x.x.x.x
 server-2 - y.y.y.y
 Shared IP - z.z.z.z
 I ping z.z.z.z and it replies on server-1 as z.z.z.z successfully. But when server-1 pings me, it uses x.x.x.x instead of z.z.z.z.
 I tried to route it via `ip route` but I think the issue is that BIRD is inherently communicating with the other instance over the eth0 IP of x.x.x.x.
 Any thoughts/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks

So, what are best practices with: - setup of single user… I wouldn’t want his account to be the admin and it says you can have non-email or apps user accounts but first glance I don’t see how. - setup of the laptop… In Win11 should I setup a local admin and then down his account it be limited/ restricted? I see it can be added as a device in M365 but can’t find any detail what that does… Is there even a domain to join?… any experience with this? - any other advice for micro tenants like this?

 The terminals need a wifi signal, which they could probably get from a phone hotspot (there is LTE out there) but the terminals might be 100 ft away from eachother so I don’t think we should rely on that, especially when 2000 people and phones are in the area for the event.
 We do have a barn with power nearby so I was going to bring one of my Ubiquiti access points, but I need a LTE receiver to feed the AP.
 Anyone have any suggestions for good receivers? I’m aware it will need a SIM card, it doesnt need to transmit wifi at all since the AP will do that. Or if I’m totally off base here let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I wanted to post about an interesting issue I found and how I was able to resolve it (and why it happened). I’m dealing with a site that is getting constant complaints about zoom not being stable. And I’ve tossed everything I could at this site, cape sensors, on-site engineers, thousandeyes monitoring etc. it wasn’t until I got endpoint details that showed me ‘packet loss’ to zoom. First thing I did was have an engineer run ping commands to zoom. This returned back (DUP!) for every other response. My first check was to Google why..nothing could really answer this for me. So I got packet captures at the firewall and the endpoint. I could see one packet leave the machine. But the firewall saw two packs. This means I need to check the WLC. I look and see the primary and secondary controllers were playing their correct roles. But looking at the interface statics I could see the secondary controller was matching packets as the primary. I shut off the ports to the secondary and the DUP! Went away. When I turned back on the secondary controller they started back up. In all of my years I’ve never seen this. Long story short. The firewall team turned off icmp on that network. Secondary controller could hit primary and vise versa, but the secondary could not hit the gateway and turned itself on. But didn’t tell anyone that it did that. So in case you hit this issue and are googling, I hope this solves your problem.

I managed to do it with IOS devices but android it seems quite buggy. The network setup assistant hasn't been updated in years and needs work around to get it working.
 I take it people do not use this system to distribute certificates to clients but they will use ISE to authenticate clients?
 What do people use? Are they using MDM now which is why it's not getting updated? It's pretty terrible and feels well out of date. This is using ISE 3.1. I've tried up to 3.3 and same but system quite buggy.
 Help to understand what industry standard is for distributing and authenticating certificate access on byod would be much appreciated!

 My question is: what can I do to lock the server, and make sure no one else is able to access it? What tools can I use to check if there are any doors open? What can I do to properly check if they left anything running on the server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I posted this on r/sysadmin as well, but thought this might be a better fit.
 I have freeradius3 installed and working as expected after following this guide: https://www.nasirhafeez.com/freeradius-with-google-g-suite-workspace-secure-ldap-for-wpa2-enterprise-wifi/
 The issue I am running into is that it doesn't work with Chromebooks, at least I've not been able to get it to. All other clients seem to work fine, but apparently chromebooks don't work with the Phase2 GTC method.
 I'm super new to freeradius. I tried to edit the configuration to use TTLS-PAP, but that doesn't seem to work.
 After doing some more digging, I found the ldap_google module in mods-available and the google-ldap-auth in sites-avialable. I tried a clean install of freeradius, and used those files the best I could understand.
 There are several things I don't really get, and I've found almost no mention of these files while googling.
 1. Does this ldap_google completely replace the ldap module?
 2. Do I have to enable the normal ldap module as well (I wouldn't think so)?
 3. Do I need to replace all of the mentions of ldap with ldap_google in the default virtual server?
 4. I have no idea why this isn't authenticating...
 I'm including the log and the configs below. Sorry for the pastebin links. I exceeded the character limit otherwise.

What is bothering me tech wise is they are supposed to do a remote wipe of the hard drives. My concern from a legal compliance perspective is if the drive wipe fails the DM does not want the hard drives destroyed but left in the equipment when we vacate.
 How can I explain to my DM that not destroying those drives opens up the company even in liquidation to a lawsuit?

Students use Chromebooks in class, and teachers are all BYOD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I followed Meraki's suggestion for load balancing and failover of client VPN connections, and it is mostly working (leveraging built-in features from our DNS provider). Connections are load balanced across 3 offices, each with a Meraki MX firewall with the Anyconnect client enabled. For failover, if one of the offices goes down, DNS will take that site out of the pool for VPN connections. However if a user is already connected and the connected site goes down, the connection doesn't automatically attempt one of the failover targets. It attempts to reconnect to the original site until you say 'disconnect', then the next manual "Connect' will find a good host. I'm trying to determine if there is a way to make this process more seamless. I've tried a little tweaking of the Anyconnect profile settings, but I'm getting the impression these are really geared towards ASA functionality. Just wondering if anyone has experience in a similar setup and getting seamless client VPN failover. I'd also take suggestions on a solution that nixes the Meraki client VPN service altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an IT engineer with just over 10 years experience. I keep myself "open to work" to recruiters on LinkedIn permanently, and I've seen more and more lucrative job adverts come my way. Fully remote, outside IR35, £600+ day rates with job specs that are pretty much my current job description. 
 I earn enough money at the moment to max out my ISA each year and have plenty left over to live. But I can't resist the "What If?" temptation. I have a 3 month notice period currently, so if I were to take the plunge, I'd have to hand my notice in first and then search for contracts after, as no client is willing to wait 3 months for me to become available.
 Equally, having said that, I tend to get bored with jobs after about 9 months anyway. Once there's no proactive problems to fix and my day becomes more about BAU, I get itchy feet. Also, my current job has awful benefits and a 24/7 on call policy which is very detrimental to my health and relationship.
 The thought of leaving my very secure, very well paying (70k GBP) job, with nothing else lined up, absolutely petrifies me. My imposter syndrome is telling me that I'd never find work, and then never find a similar paying job once I have to come crawling back to perm with my tail between my legs. Setting up a limited company, hiring an accountant, etc. Spending thousands and putting all that effort in...
 I have enough savings to last a year or so with no income, but is it worth the risk? Would appreciate other opinions, thanks!

One of our ISPs is very reliable but speed isn’t great. The other is very fast but has a high outage rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any of you out there with your machines AAD Joined + Intune enrolled and the actual user accounts hybrid identity from on-prem?
 Currently we utilize AADDS, I think the orgs initial goal was to use it to hook up to a couple legacy vendor apps, however, the business requirements have gotten so complex that we are extremely limited with AADDS. Would it make sense to have two IaaS DCs in Azure, this is just so the identities would be hybrid, nothing would change authentication wise as we would use PHS, and our physical devices still remain AAD joined. 
 A few benefits here: 
 We can leverage AAD Kerberos with Azure Files and benefit there by finally having the option to utilize ACL permissions on an AAD joined machine. No line of sight to DC required 
 Windows 365 HAADJ Is seamless, PRT token, Hybrid joined and enrolled prelogon. AAD join is also an option. 
 The ability to use FsLogix securely via Kerberos tickets, no access keys. 
 Ability to Hybrid Join virtual machines and auto enroll them in intune, previously with AADDS, a lot of the VMs weren’t supported for Intune enrollment with AVD. 
 Our Vendor had us make 1,000 groups in AADDS and they had to be in specific OUs, so we couldn’t create them from Azure and sync them back to the Root of AADDS, therefore there is no way to sync these groups back to Azure without hybrid AD and not just the AADDS offering. 
 I don’t really see a point of using AADDS when onprem ADDS is far capable of more and we don’t really lose anything. Plus there is zero impact to the users accounts as they are hard/soft matched with PHS.

 The full URL list should never be visible to the ISP, only every single user web request needs be checked if its within our URL DB. 
 We would need the software and hardware solution that will be deployed at the ISPs datacenter. Our “Domain Blocklist” will be deployed on that solution and updated regularly by us.

 First, yes i know, i am an idiot, i am not very familiar with RAID technologies, that's not an excuse, so i am still an idiot.
 Late Last night, i was looking for software to manage and monitor my disks mounted in RAID1 (2 SSD for system C:) and RAID5 (3 HDD for Data D:) on my HP Z640 computer.
 Previously i had configured my RAID volums via the F3 menu in BIOS (Intel RSTe) and wanted to find an easier way to see RAID health in windows. I found this: Intel VROC and (shame on me) i installed it on my windows server 2022...
 Now, after the restart, windows does not want to launch anymore and shows me the repair page and it seems that i no longer see the volume in RAID5 as if it no longer existed while in the F3 menu i can clearly see my 2 volumes ready. 
 I confess that i don't understand much about it. Anyone know if this is definitetly dead and i have to reinstall everything Or if i can find my volumes as before? I've readed some documentation but i find nothing and this is difficult because english is not my mother language. 
 Thank you very much for reading me and thank you very much to those who can enlighten me on the subject.

 I hope this post finds you well as this is my first post here. Hope somebody can help. 
 We are currently trying to switch from our call system for our Helpdesk as they often talks about it being stressful and not very compliant for a helpdesk as there is no “rules” and the phone keeps ringing for everybody and that’s why we want to change to a more useful calling system thus why I’m writing. 
 Do any of you recommend a calling system that you are currently using which can be connect with our AAD and also is user friendly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 so this year we are focusing on upgrading every and any outdated operating system, and we reached the point that it was time to update our hyperv cluster.
 Our cluster is composed by 3 servers + 1 iscsi target + 1 replication server.
 We have 3 networks there: managent + iscsi + heartbeat, where only heartbeat is assigned for cluster communication.
 We started by migrating one server, creating a new cluster on the new node, adding the volume targets to the updated node and everything worked fine. When adding the second migrated node, the node is correctly added and we can see correct voting, but a problem starts where HyperV services become unresponsive and we start to see cluster events where CSV volumes fail and DCM handling volume unmap reports appear.
 We tested and every node can connect to the CSVs on their own. Our feeling is that it might be network related, but we are using the same network connections as before as well.
 As anyone seen this before?
 Best Regards

 Long story short, my computers are old enough, and they need to be replaced its like 4 years old 80% of my gpu is GTX 3060 It's more than enough for my customers' needs So me and my managers decide to replace all of it's like a 200k cost that's not USD dollar's, it's more than that

 during a Wireless Site Survey I've tools that analyze the frequency, channels, interference.
 A customer called me because during the day the devices remained connected to the network but did not reach the applications. Site survey shows me that in the same area there were in the same ssid some cisco AP and some ubnt AP. In a completely random way I found an AP with right SSID but in the switch there was a misconfigured vlan, when a client connect in that AP the servers aren't reachable.
 Is there a tool that test the connection IP of every AP ?

It’s a collaboration tool, and it has its purposes for files, but not to take an entire file server and dump it in the wrong tool. Just my 2 cents. There’s better stuff like Azure Files or if you wanted, old school file server on-prem, or even a third party enterprise tool! Not a collab tool.

 Sharepoint is an option, but is not designed to replace a file share, and is a PITA with 10+ TB 
 Blob Storage is great, and cheap if you archive or do it right, but our org doesn’t want users in there, and rather something more user friendly. 
 Azure Files is an option, but is not secure unless you at least have AADDS, ADDS or ADDS with AAD Kerberos and AAD devices. In our case, none of these apply, we want to retain our accounts as Cloud only, as well as the devices. 
 Azure files in this scenario requires an access key, which isn’t meant for production, and you can’t apply permissions via SMB/NTFS, so it isn’t really a secure method unless it’s test data, etc. 
 What tools do you guys use? NetApp, or Something third party? Those of you who are 100% cloud only, of course

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've put a lot of work into reducing our vulnerabilities but one area where we're hurting is Microsoft SQL and Apache/Tomcat vulnerabilities. The reason it's this way because what happens is an outside vendor comes in and installs their software which usually has SQL and Apache/Tomcat and then it's hands off. The team knows nothing about maintaining those applications so it's more of a leave them alone type of thing. To be honest it seems most of the team could care less about vulnerabilities as a whole and the only time anyone does care is management when an audit comes around. I feel the attitude is "they're internal to our network. If someone exploits those that means their inside and we have bigger problems."
 Is Apache/Tomcat as bad as our team makes out to keep current? Is it just an upgrade over the top that's easy/peasy? As for SQL it's usually nothing more than a service pack goes end-of-life or more so the version goes end-of-life. As I said the attitude is leave it alone because we don't know if upgrading it from SQL 17 TO 19 will break anything. 
 Anyway, I'm getting tired of staring at those usually high level vulnerabilities with nothing being done about them. I want to ask my management if we can just mark them as accepted risks if we're never going to do anything so I can get them out of my face. Any input would be appreciated about these applications. Thanks.

I've been able to manage my work without these kinds of systems before, but new COO wants them for a few reasons: better visibility into what we're working on and priorities, visibility into where time our is being spent and workload (which would help make the case for a third), ways to see if something's blocking ongoing projects, etc. I'm not opposed to any of these goals. My questions are:
  
Do you use one system for both ticketing and project management or separate systems? What do you use and how well does it work?
 How do you track time spent and estimate workload? Do you track literal hours or estimate workload with other metrics like outstanding tickets?

I have had many opportunities to flesh out my knowledge in different areas and have been network adjacent for most of my career but never having to dive into it directly. It's my biggest blindspot /weak point.
 I am starting to dig into free resources to learn more of routing, where protocols specifically fall into the OSI model and inspecting wireshark logs. I am currently learning packet tracer to help lab some of it out.
 I didn't know if some of you had a similar experience or had practical advice how you expanded your networking knowledge.

 Like every other manufacturer on the planet, they have CNC machines that haven't been updated since about 2012. 
 One of their old file servers to be decommissioned is accessed by their machines to pull files. We built a new server 2022 machine, enabled 8dot3names and SMB1 for these particular CNC machines and then migrated file shares. 
 We have confirmed that pulling a file list via CMD shows file and folder names in 8dot3. We can reach it from other devices on the network, ping, etc. We cannot get these CNC machines to see or access folders. Any other ideas for troubleshooting?

 I have recently started pursuing my CompTIA A+ Certification. I am learning about network designs and cables. I wanted to know if patch panels are always necessary for a network design. My work for example I believe has patch panels in the communication room. The cables from the wall ethernet ports connect to the patch panel and then the panel is connected to the main ethernet switch. 
 I just wanted to know if there is a reason why the wall jack cables aren't just connected to the ethernet switch and bypass the patch panel altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, I hope this post doesn't get deleted for lack of details but I'm looking for something from scratch. 
 I've read a lot of documents and seen a lot of videos of OSPF Design, BGP Design, how to configure things on the layer 2 network. 
 Layer 2 best practices like ensuring there is sync between STP root with HSRP etc etc. 
 Understood traffic engineering using BGP (Border Gateway Politics) and so on and on.. 
 But all I've seen and read is about how to configure, design and best practices of a technology/protocol. 
 What I'm looking for basically is, let's say if I were to design a network for 50000 employees both Enterprise and Datacenter, where would I start? I know how vague this question is and there are tons of factors involved instead of just setting up random tech but what would be a good place to start? Where can I read/learn more about this? 
 I've read articles and read CCDE material (of course not all of it, but again it's more based on how to design ospf multi area etc etc (just an example)).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago when I was at the helpdesk, I had near constant conflicts with a server admin. It began when the admin found out I was gay, and our work relationship went downhill quickly after that. Over the years, neither of us trusted the others work. It escalated to the point the admin directly made accusations of "hacking" one of the privileged accounts to log into a server, only hours later to find out it was another admin on his team who used that account. These types of accusations (directly and indirectly) continued over the years until he left the organization a few years ago. 
 ​
 Just to address these accusations, none of them stuck to the wall, and only one case did a manager even question whether the accusation was accurate. I have a 100% clean record.
 ​
 Since that time, a complete staff turnover and expansion of the server team brought in new people, and I have moved into a desktop admin position. Unfortunately, I have heard of some of these previous accusations from the new staff, which I am realizing now, has damaged my credibility. One of the managers who left our organization believes the harm of the accusations from the previous admin has poisoned the work relationship with the new staff and it'd be best to leave.
 ​
 I do believe the best option is to leave. I would prefer to stay. Are there any suggestions on how to recover from a damaged reputation? In hindsight, I should have addressed this immediate with management, but I took the approach of trying not to escalate the situation. Letting it linger this long clearly was a mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure this has been asked before, but it's interesting to get all the weird and wonderful answers. Mine's below.
 Industrial client with control room. All machines are dumb desktops running Windows 10 LTSC with RDP shortcuts to virtual control screens, so you can easily switch out hardware.
 One control system was running Windows XP (welcome to industrial life) and every 10 minutes the RDP session would drop. No explanation or warning, would just vanish. This didn't happen on the desktops RDPing to more modern OSs. Tried to comb through event logs for a week, with no indication as to what was happening.
 Eventually resorted to running a WireShark capture on both the client and control system, and captured some funny ARP requests the moment the sessions dropped.
 It turned out that a switch had an SVI onto the network the PCs and control system sat on, but whilst this was supposed to be a /23 network, the switch's VLAN interface was configured as a /24. That meant every time the PC sent out an ARP request for the control system, the switch would "helpfully" try and act as an ARP forwarder, as the address was the "other side" of the /23, which the switch knew wasn't on its network. Got rid of the SVI and bam, problem stopped.

They have already sent us IP configuration information and this is the first time I am doing colocation and aside from that, my network experience comes from homelabbing as I do not do this professionally. Couple questions are: Do I need a router, or will a managed switch do? They are providing us one uplink and my thought is to tag a couple (or all) the ports with the VLAN ID that the IP addresses are on and connect my servers and their IPMIs to it, also tagging the vlan id and filling out the network config they gave us from there (IP address, gateway, netmask, etc.). I saw a comment somewhere on reddit regarding colo prep and someone recommended to "lab" this before going out the datacenter and I am trying to figure out what that entails - do I just mock a router that is configured with the VLAN ID and make the local IPs be the actual IPs, config the switch and servers and make sure they could talk to each other?
 ​
 Also another question is, if I need a router, how will will I make the connection to the uplink? I am looking at Miktrotik and I assume it would be easy as defining addresses to an interface (uplink)? For routing, what would you use? I am looking at both Mikrotik and pfSense. Cisco seems a little more complicated for me and VyOS is something I was also exploring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently been toying around with GNS3, and I'd love to set up a replica of my work's internal network, but I'm struggling to figure out how to import appliances for our actual hardware. I know that GNS3 has a lot of different appliances available on their marketplace, but they unfortunately do not have our router or switch models. Is there a way I can import our actual hardware, or am I just going to have to find something similar? It would be awesome if I could just use a config backup or something in order to replicate our network as closely as possible.

 Listening to the analysis and reading the latest Trump indictment, it's clear that the IT guy at Mar-a-lago has being a federal witness.
 It appears he did this because he was instructed by his superiors to delete security footage.
 He did the right thing.
 This should be an informative moment. IF you ever find yourself working for an organization and the people involved are under criminal indictment, and you're asked to delete, move, etc anything.. don't.
 He likely spared himself from being a co-defendant with the property manager of Mar-a-lago.
 You can have any opinion about if you think Trump will end up going to jail, etc.. but make no mistake, the people involved in Mar-a-lago likely will. They don't have his name recognition and their council is being entirely paid for by Trump.. That's another lesson.. Council listens to who pays them.. if you're not paying.. your not the client.
 Moral of the story.. Follow the law and your own moral compass.

 I work with a small company using a mix of Mac and Windows over a Meraki Client L2TP VPN to remote into their office network to connect to a file share hosted on a Synology NAS via SMB2/3. I have one machine that keeps timing out connecting to the file share. This machine wasn’t setup or configured any differently than the others. 
 I’ve checked all the common issues that are shared by all clients - network speeds, Synology SMB settings, MTUs, etc, and I’ve been unable to replicate the issue on another machine. 
 I’ve also tested other variables on the client machine - different remote IPs/connections, different logins, as well as different transfer protocols - FTP, https, WebDAV. I’ve tried mounting the file share as a mapped drive and as a network connection. 
 No matter what, when this machine is connected to the VPN, it can connect to the share and navigate the directories fine, but as soon as I try to transfer any file, it times out and if I’m using SMB it will freeze Windows Explorer. 
 2 other notes: - when connected to the VPN and I try to load a local IP in a web browser, say, the Synology admin portal, it also times out - the WebDAV connection has the same issues over https even when not connected to the VPN. 
 What could this possibly be, and how do I test for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I inherited when I started my new role about 6 months ago was several Windows Failover clusters running on vSphere. 
 In all my years of supporting VMware (close to more than fifteen to be exact) WSFA were a terrible thing to have due to complexity. 
 These clusters are running SQL server with the idea of HA for availability during things like patching or if a host went down. 
 My opinion though is that there is a better way to have HA without MSFA cluster services on VMware and I just wanted some feedback and opinions.
 SQL always on is an option but I am sure we would need to move to SQL enterprise licensing to leverage that. VMware HA services are another option but again, the business seems to think that always available is the absolute only solution regardless of patching. 
 At any rate, I genuinely appreciate the sub's feedback and any experience on this!

 We’re 50% remote based with a small team of five. I’d like something that can be built on over time. Most of the office uses M1/M2 powered Macs.
 Initially looking at around £1,500. I’m not scared of used parts. 
 I’ve no experience with local servers / NAS builds, but have lot’s of experience building computers.
 Where should I start? All advice very welcome.

 Ability to capture and analyze packets
 Ability to connect with virtual devices from the outside (i.e. host machine) (excluding VMs might imply excluding this points, so it's not crucial for me)
 Ease of debug
 Exhaustive (or a least good) documentation
 Speed of development (I'm quite limited in time)

 My workplace has a lab environment that consists of two Avaya routeswitches connected to an Aruba switch stack and an Aruba wireless controller stack. I need to move all these devices to a new subnet.
 I have connected all these devices to an Opengear terminal and can connect to the console of all the devices. So far I have moved the management IP of all the devices to the new subnet. All the devices can ping the management IP of the other devices. I can see there are many other vlan interfaces that are still in the old subnet. Am I correct to assume that I need to assign all these vlan interfaces an IP in the new subnet? Is there anything else I would need to consider?
 Thanks in advance for any advice

But like a rabbit stuck in the head lights there is so much. nothing that I have found that is what I am looking for. Does anyone know of any books, Training or websites. that is specifically only looking at networking in the azure and aws cloud. Training that bridges the gap between traditional networking and the cloud and explains it in a manner that can be grasped by a network engineer.
 I've looked at the training on offer and not only is it vast but I can't see a starting point or anything that is relevant. Also nothing that goes through the web front end and shows the elements.
 I admit maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way so really just reaching out for a life line. If anyone can steer me in the right direction I would be greatful.

 I need a way to remotely connect to many Windows 10 devices (based in factories) and pull the modified date of a particular file they store locally in the same place (it's an xml file). I'm hoping to see if there is a script I can run on a server that points to a list of IP addresses of these PCs or their DNS name and grabs the last modified date and then puts all this into a simple csv that I can import into a DB or show in Grafana, but a CVS is just fine. The hard part for me is scripting.
 Do you think this is possible? I have been give a local account these PCs all have too. I'm not sure if I should be Googling PS or Python for this either.
 I think with PS I can use the Get-ChildItem 'D:\temp\test.log' command for this as I tested on my home PC and it works or Invoke-Command {Get-ChildItem "D:\temp\test.log"} -ComputerName DESKTOP-1234. I'm just researching on how I can build a script that points to a source list in a .txt with the remote IPs and include the username and password and push to CSV.
 Has anyone done anything like this before and think it's possible?
 I was thinking of putting Telegraf of a Prometheus plugin on each PC, but I'm not allowed to, these would have push this data to InfluxDB or Prometheus. I have to use a server to pull this info.
 Any advise or examples would really be nice if someone has 2 mins to spare and get me on the right path.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I just want to ask about this network issue that I've been troubleshooting for the past few days.
 I'm currently tasked to do a new segment for our upcoming room transfer. I already set up a new VLAN interface for a new segment in our Fortigate 310B. I just added the new VLAN interface on the port where there are existing VLAN interfaces already.
 Here is a summary of what I've done now:
 Fortigate 310B:
 -Done setting up the VLAN interface (w/ VLAN ID, IP/Netmask). This will be my gateway (192.168.172.1) for my new segment
 -Done setting up the necessary routes (going to internet, active directory, file servers, and other necessary networks) and policies also
 Cisco Switch:
 -Done adding the new VLAN ID on the trunk port (this trunk port is dedicated to the FW port where I setup a new VLAN interface together with the existing VLAN interfaces)
 -Done setting up the access port (new VLAN ID) for my new segment which my VM (192.168.172.2)
 VM:
 -Done setting up the necessary IP configurations (IP: 192.168.172.2 NM: /27 GW: 192.168.172.1)
 -Turned off the firewall also just to make sure
 Now here lies the problem:
 -I can't seem to ping my own gateway (192.168.172.1) from my VM (192.168.172.2) within the same network but I can ping other networks (8.8.8.8, other subnets, etc.)
 -Active directory server, file servers, and other subnets can ping the gateway (192.168.172.1) and yet it can't ping my VM (192.168.172.2) or other hosts of that network
 -The ping option in my VLAN interface is already enabled btw
 -When I tried to traceroute my gateway (192.168.172.1), it routes thru my ISP gateway
 -I tried using an existing VLAN on the access port and it can ping/traceroute it's gateway
 I'm not really sure what I'm missing here so hopefully you can help me with this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I know this post isn't traditional sysadmin stuff. Our police dispatch center uses Intrado Viper with 7-digit Frontier Centranet lines. Right now all inbound calls to our dispatch center that come from AT&T wireless or any voip providers are staticky. Outbound calls are fine. Calls from Verizon wireless are fine. Calls from other Frontier Centranet lines are fine. You might think this is an issue with Viper except we have a second non-police location that has a interactive voice response system that is also having issues and it too uses frontier Centranet lines. Frontier came out earlier today and decided the issue wasn't theirs and closed a couple of tickets and said they would return on Monday to continue investgating. The problem is our police dispatch center cannot wait until Monday -we need to get a dispatch now and I've had no luck getting anybody to come out. Anyone else ever run into this issue? What did you do to resolve it?

 ```

 By setting a new String value of 3 and another 4 to the new icon it should change all the default folder icons. 
 This works when the view is set to "Details" & "Lists" but does not work with any other view. Does anyone know if views such as "Large Icons" is handled differently for folder view?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our org currently has Accounts sourced in AAD, lately this has cause way too many limitations, even with AADDS, Azure AD Domain Services.
 We want to migrate away from AADDS Joined VDI to AAD Joined VDI for many reasons, including the fact Intune enrollment is not supported with Multi-Session VDI while you are joined to AADDS.
 AAD Join works perfect, however, there is a limitation where you cannot use FsLogix or Azure file share without an access key. This basically prevents us from being able to continue using VHDX mounting from FsLogix, since MS doesn't support AAD Auth to Shares.
 I spun up a DC on-prem and Sync'd a couple test users by performing a hard/soft match against existing AAD Accounts, with PHS as the primary Auth method, I'm able to bind my FQDN, on-prem GUID and Service principal back to the Azure File share on the storage account and I'm also now pull a kerberos ticket from my onprem KDC, which is amazing, this also means I can use FsLogix with AAD Join, as long as my AAD Joined machines have a kerberosTicketRetrieval CSP Set via registry.
 I'm also noticing, since I've configured AAD Connect to use PHS vs PTA, my accounts AND my passwords are syncing back to AADDS, so it's essentially a 3 way sync:
 AD > AAD > AADDS
 Has anyone ever done anything like this before? I'm sure it is uncommon to see my situation/scenario.

 This building is an OLD "historic" building. But the interior is completely new. When they rebuilt the interior, each office suite has a storage closet, in each storage closet there is a patch panel for the network drops in the suite, and there is one port that hooks directly into the buildings internet connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, you read that right.
 An executive at my company just made this request, they want every email address/domain an employee sends an email to, be whitelisted. This was prompted because a few "partners" had responses to their marketing messages go to their junk folder.
 Whats frustrating is the same executive requested to have "All Marketing Emails Treated as Spam" just a few months prior because they wanted to clean up their inbox.
 The last email I received from this executive was blasted out to the company requesting that I notify them when the changes have been made for everyone.
 I get Outlook has this feature, but its terrible, never whitelist domains. Especially in the financial industry. 
 I sent an email to our CCO explaining how bad this could be but its falling on deaf ears. Apparently, explaining the security risks of automatically whitelisting domains and how insecure email is, broke the camels back. 
 Honestly, I'm not sure what to do. I've been an IT Director for years, I don't know anything else. This company has put me through hell and back and I've only been with them 2 years. 
 You know that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you're stressed beyond belief. When the realization hits and you know there is nothing you can do to save your job, life, family. When you're one paycheck away from having nothing and someone with power decides they want to use you as a doormat. That's were I'm at.
 Sorry for the rant, I don't have anyone I can talk too. We're a 100+ employee firm and I am the only "IT Guy"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have officeconnect switches with no central management & Extreme APs. 
 I hate being forced to pay a yearly subscription to use our equipment (looking at you XIQ.) 
 We were looking at Aruba Instant On but we would need to split locations up in to mulitple sites and it just sounds like it wouldn't be easy to manage. 
 We have about 15 campuses, 90 buildings - 23 MDFs and ~60 APs spread throughout. Mostly web traffic. On average our APs serve ~5 clients, occasionally they might see 40-50 clients. 
 Should we be looking more closely at Ubiquiti or moving up to the next tier of equipment? 
 Our needs/wants:
  
SFP ports 
 SFP+ for 10Gb would be nice but likely not needed (we don't move a lot of data)
 
 PoE+
 Centralized Management
 layer 3 lite or 
 Decent Warranty
 Preferably no or very low annual costs
 Inexpesnive smaller switches would be nice (4 or 8 port)
  
We do have fortigates - I'm wondering if we should start looking at that line of products with FortiManager. I've heard bad things about Fortiswitches and fortimanager though. 
 Should we stick with Extreme and explore their switch option? My gripe with them is we have to pay ~$12k a year for license/support for APs. We could replace all our APs with Aruba ION for what we pay in one year.

 It feels so amazing, mates! To be seen! 
 It's like a poetic justice thing, too, since I was "Tier 1/ Technical Specialist " at an MSP, worked hard and became an asset to try to get promoted to T2, they brought in an external candidate, gave them the title Systems Administrator. I didn't want/expect to become a Systems admin there, but I was just kind of blind sided, especially since im such am asset and one of the "good ones". And then, they kept carrot dangling us with these B.S titles. More work/clients, more responsibility, less techs, more ENTITLEMENT (please be courteous back! Say hello back, boss.) , and at the same pay and title? Nah. As soon as their bi monthly spiel about how they want to "pave a path for promotion " and "have been working on it" (for 8+ months now...) was done, I got the call. I was tickled. The universe is funny :)
 So if y'all have any tips or what I should prepare for, please share!!! Im setting aside a crap ton of time this weekend to prepare.

 When I right click on the terminal window and press on "duplicate session", another frozen window opens. Basically I can't do anything.
 The SSH tunnel is correctly established and can be used by other applications (e.g. RemoteDesktop). In this way everything works and I can work on remote server.
 Problem: I'm now trying to do the same with a LINUX server. The same happens with Putty - a locked terminal is opened. In this case, RemoteDesktop doesn't work, as it only works for Windows.
 Questions:- How can I solve this problem? I can imagine there are softwares like RemoteDesktop that allows you to connect to a Linux server? Or there are some settings in Putty that avoid the opened window to be frozen? (or maybe is some corporate policy?)
 - How can I open another terminal and connect to the server with the CLI using the existing SSH tunnel?

Throughout my career I've had great culture in my remote workplace - My team always said good morning, communicated throughout the day to overcome roadblocks, sent memes, and let folks know when they logged out for the evening. It truly felt like being part of a unit who tried to accomplish a common goal. But at this new job, there's no casual chatter whatsoever - I just clock in on the time system, do my work, and only message people if absolutely necessary. Is this normal? I imagine some folks will see this as ideal but it's quite a culture shock to me and it's been difficult to get my bearings without a "buddy" to answer questions.
 I haven't even met the guys on my team so I scheduled 1:1s with everyone under my boss's umbrella just to make my face known, and most of them mentioned that it was unusual and no one had done that before.
 Should I just let go of the culture I'm comfortable with and learn to appreciate the solitude? Any advice is appreciated.

 I've been trying to figure out how to fix this for a while now and Im not sure what to do. Ive opened up putty, connected to my instance via putty (I use mobaxterm normally) and saved and accepted the key when I connect, tried again and still get the error. Looking for some guidance on how to fix this. Most of the youtube videos I see and articles are around a copy of EVE-NG running on a local VM and not in the cloud, so I'm a little lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings
 I'm reverse-engineering a working but neglected network with just enough networking knowledge to get myself in trouble.
 We have about 15 VLANS defined on the switch, only a few of them are actively in use.
 There are two entries on our core switch (Cisco Catalyst 4500e) in the running config that I'm trying to figure out.
 access-list 100 deny ip any 10.1.30.0 0.0.0.255
 access-list 100 permit ip any any
 The thing that's throwing me off is that 10.1.30.0/24 is our main production VLAN and there's a ton of that traffic running through this switch.
 I'm clearly interpreting the rule incorrectly because it seems to read, "block all IP traffic from 10.1.30.0/24" but clearly that traffic is flowing through just fine.
 The second rule seems to be a catch-all, "LET IT ALL THROUGH!" rule... is that typical? Best practice?
 As I said, everything works as expected, but the network is due for an overhaul so I'm trying to get things documented "as-is" and these two entries are throwing me off a bit.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 We have a private line to one of our sister companies to exchange data, this line has recently changed and therefore, so has the IP
 We currently route via static routes on both our host servers and our guest VMs direct to the router interface IP
 This time however, we’re going via a firewall which handles the routing - there is a slight issue however, our DG has a route applied for the current config but some jackass lost the password (I’ve very recently taken over).
 So currently I’m routing DHCP and servers directly to the firewall which then handles the routing, great - this works fine and we can now see our sister company and reach their network
 However, there is an issue coming back, they can not see us - they reach the router and then the packet drops, I was not aware of anything that would need to be setup ourside to route their traffic internally? It doesn’t look like this is currently setup (I’m not a network engineer).
 If we can reach them, why wouldn’t they be able to reach us? I currently have a firewall configured to route traffic to them, and our guest VMs also are setup to route to them, the hosts currently are not but I don’t see how this would cause an issue? Could it be something to do with the route applied on the DG? But again, we can get to them OK?
 Would appreciate any advice on where to start looking…
 Thanks all.

 One of the first things he requested when he took over as CEO was a "Windows 7 laptop". At first I thought I misread it, but nope. I asked for clarification because I assumed it had to have been a mistake. To my horror, it was not. He specifically stated that he's been using windows 7 since its inception and that it's the last enterprise worthy OS release from Microsoft, and that he believes windows 10 is more about advertising and selling user data than being an enterprise/business oriented OS offering. 
 He claims he came from the security sector and that they were able to accommodate him at his last job with a Windows 7 machine, and that that place "was like fort Knox", and that with a good anti virus and zero trust/least privilege there should be no concern using it over windows 10. 
 At first I didn't know what to think.. I began downloading windows 7 updates in WSUS to accommodate the request. Then I thought about it more, and I think it's a lose lose for me. If I don't accommodate, I'm ruffling the feathers of the new CEO and could be replaced as a result. If I do, and it causes some sort of security breach, my job is on the line. I started to wonder if this odd request was for the sole purpose of having a reason to get rid of me? How would you handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm fairly new in the enterprise routing switching and cloud area as I just moved up from mostly loadbalancing, monitoring and ISE and we recently lost one of our last remaining primary route/switch guys. But I'm working on connecting a recent circuit we acquired for Azure express route through an ISP thats using Megaport to peer up with our Azure tenant.
 There's still some foggy design once I get the actual circuit portion connected in but I'm thinking of pathing it in to a couple of ASRs in our DC as the BGP peering between our Primary DC and the Azure Expressroute circuit.
 I've got a design picture from the ISP showing a single switch (we have this in our DC right now) connecting to one of our cisco switches using a Q-in-Q trunk, then after that it's basically up to us for the routing and potentially firewall side of things.
 My question to them was trying to ask if I need to be aware of their C-tags on our end, or if I just setup a single q-in-q trunk to our switch and tag our own vlans and somehow work with that after the fact.
 They only replied to me with info on the 2 CTags (308, 307), one for primary and one for secondary as Expressroute seems to setup a couple BGP sessions as built in redundancy, so I'm a bit confused on how to differentiate, or setup the layer 2 config, for the primary and secondary use case on our end with only the 1 physical connection from the ISP.
 Has anyone ever worked on such a setup before with express route like this? I know I'm a bit in over my head but nobody else here has any more answers than I do as most of us are quite green on the team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Problem 1 - So the environment has about ~1000 computers. We had maybe half of the computers have uptime over 7 days, and a third over 14 days. 
 Problem 1 fix - I created a task a couple of years ago in PDQ, but have moved to Ninja, to create pop-ups using the msg.exe stating your computer's uptime is more than X days! Please reboot.
 Problem 2 - Now we only have about 30-50 computers that have over 18 days uptime. 
 Opinion - I think the best course of action would be to force shut down the computer after 4 days (4 days for the reason of the weekend, month end, payroll, etc...) and have a pop-up counter every now and then showing it's going to happen. I was going to run a shutdown /s /t 345600, but I'm unsure how to make a pop-up with the date or time of the force reboot. It does do a pop up when executed and when there are I think 5 or 2 minutes left. I could make a different pop-up at noon, for people at 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, and 22 days, with a comment of the reboot will happen in X days at noon (X hours) and possibly -a the previous shutdown command. 
 Why? - We have seen a large reduction in tickets from these pop-ups, and fewer complaints about stuff being slow. However the 80/20 rule of 20% of your users will create 80% of the problems, and of course, those 20% refuse to reboot their computers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I was wondering what SMTP service people are using as I am scouting for alternatives. 
 We are currently using Sendgrid SaaS through Azure and relay mails through a hosted SMTP server to Sendgrid. This is mostly because most of the printers we use do not support passwords longer than 64 characters so the sendgrid API key wont work. We use IP whitelisting instead of authentication ( not the best solution i know)
  
 However, we are growing and more services are using the Sendgrid tenant. Some systems that use this have supporters that would like access to check the mail logs for these services, however, since all the domains are in the same service, and there is no way of restricting ther access to certain domains ( as far as i know) it is starting to become a pain in the ass.
 Thought about setting up a seperate SendGrid for these services, but then DKIM and DMARC will be acting up.
  
 What is everyone else using and what can you recommend?
 Basically looking for something that supports basic auth or ip whitelisting for printers, or relay from SMTP and where we can delegate access based on domain and/or service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems to me that every time when people talk about learning automation there is a large laundry list of things to learn. And everyone assumes you want to go from zero to hero. While I really just want to send simultaneous commands and some sequential scripts to multiple devices, and then if I become good at it go further.
 Is there an approach to learig etwork automation 'on the go' as I go about my daily work and I do it in between slow times?
 My idea so far is that I install ansible on my windows work laptop and just try running a few commands on our lab equipment. And from there as I get more confident maybe go on to more elaborate stuff.
 First squirm, then crawl, walk, run and only then sprint.

 I see that the pro bono TACACS+ software has a new(-ish?) variant, tac_plus-ng
 https://www.pro-bono-publico.de/projects/tac_plus-ng.html
 This claims to be able to do TACACS over TLS, but says that this is not a standard.
 Does anyone know if there is much in the way of support for this from device vendors? Cos I assume it will have to be supported at both the device and server end for it to work.
 I can't find any mention of support for it on one of my biggest hitter device types, so I'm not very hopeful :(

The switch lives in a rack in our DC , the original setup hosted 2 full cabinets of physical machines and over time was reduced to 6 physical machines ,cross connect to iscsi San and Synology Nas. 3 of the physical machines are hypervisors with 10 lagged nics each. All ports are copper 1 gig. We are restructuring and looking to replace the 4500 with a pair of stacked 48 port switches, new hosts and San will be using 10g ports. The switches need to be L3 as they will be doing routing (static) , support lag, and have at least half (preferably all) of the ports 1/10g copper. Want to stay with Cisco, I live in the cli and would prefer to keep it that way. Any suggestions on the switch family that isnt approach eol?

 10 years ago we had a team of 20 db/vmware/linux/windows admins that did only that and life was good.
 Customers and work load kept increasing, yet due to automatization we managed to solve everything.
 Now that team is 10 persons strong and the gain of automatization is dwindling. So we ask for extra hires. -> denied no budget.
 Yet in these same 10 years the following "positions" have been created.
 Project manager ( in the past the sysadmin did this) Service delivery manager Service level manger Service assitance manager Escalation manager Customer account manager Customer succes manager ....
 I'm not saying these functions are useless but this cuts into our profit and our budget for new hires. Also these positions add to the workload of the sysadmin because they can't do nothing on there own.
 So now it's Get a ticket Realise you cannot solve this quicly and need more time to investigate ( 10 years ago you just had time) Write a report to service level manger why you need more time. Inform escalation Write escalation report ...
 It almost looks like I need to write reports explaining why we cannot solve something instead of just solving it.
 And you know the worst part. The customer themselves also have these BS positions and they are happy with all those reports.
 It almost looks like a symbiosis of our positions keeping the customer positions alive and vice versa.

 I have many fileserver with deduplication activated and I'm considering to activate Azure File Sync and implement cache servers to reduce local footprint. As i understand, Azure File Sync is compatible with data deduplication, but it doesn't process files in /system volume information https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/storage/file-sync/file-sync-planning.md
 So, if i want to implement cache servers, they will have to be minimum the size of the actual "/system volume information"; is this correct?
 What are the benefit if i can move to Azure File Sync only the stub files?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seen a few posts on here about being dropped in at the deep end so thought I'd share my experience of this.
 My first role in IT support, I was part of a 2 person IT department for a small college, just me and the IT Manager. My Manager was very knowledgeable and taught me a lot about the general day to day of doing support.
 After about 9 months, the Manager went on sick leave, which was fine at first as there had been times where I was on my own for the day to cover annual leave/weekends etc. After a week of him being on sick leave and completely out of communication I was starting to get concerned as even though I was handling my day to day tasks, I was starting to get more questions that I had no idea about, and would usually pass up to the Manager. I had to very quickly learn how to manage all of the IT requirements for the college, updating business critical software, dealing with suppliers, deciding on purchases, managing the IT budget etc. 
 The Manager never came back from his sick leave, I only saw him 1 more time about a year later when he came in to collect some stuff. I ended up being a 1 person IT department for 9 years and was very comfortable doing that role. The only reason I left is because the college merged with another larger college and I would have had to become a smaller role in a 6 person IT department, which felt like a step backwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I took an opportunity to get some basically free server hosting at a friends work place since they’ve got a bunch of unused public IPs. I’ve already bought the hardware, being two servers, and I want some advise on what I’ve chosen to do and if anyone has a different way that might be better for management specifically.
 So first things first, I got a 1u R620 that I plan to install pfsense onto and have it route 3 different incoming wans into 3 different places. One will be a private network with full firewall and all, another will be a similar one but will specifically run a few servers that are ported out through the firewall. And the last one is going to hold my email server (I’ve got rdns and ip configs in place)
 Both of the “public” networks will be routed to a single server, R720 running proxmox(because I like it) and will be internally routed to the vms it needs to go on. My next no open ports network, is going to be my management network I guess, specifically so I can configure the pfsense when needed without exposing the webui of it to any other server. I’m thinking a little Dell optiplex running Ubuntu server and something j can connect to it with. I plan to have some sort of vpn set up so I can vpn in and talk to that management network.
 I know this sounds not the best and messy, hence why I’m here. It’s the best I could come up with in a few nights. Some guidance would be nice to see what other people recommend for this. I’m looking for advise on more of the networking side and how to more efficiently implement this setup.

 I have a situation with our SUSE Linux supercomputer where it has to be turned off for a few days due to scheduled upgrades in our data center. After the upgrades are completed, and I have to power it back on and get everything up and running. However, I 'm not sure if I should turn on the worker nodes first or the head node? I would greatly appreciate some advice from the community!
 Here's a brief overview of our supercomputer setup: we have a head node and seven worker nodes. The head node acts as the control hub for all the worker nodes, coordinating their tasks and distributing computational workloads efficiently. Your input and suggestions are highly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m very curious about how/if network automation is done at your company.
 I’m a year out of school, and I first learned about the network automation trend then. I then did a deep dive on the common Python libraries (Netmiko/Nornir/Napalm) and Ansible.
 I now work at a big bank and realize writing one-off scripts to do configuration management/config checking doesn’t cut it, because while running a script at the CLI works, it’s not consumable for a wider audience.
 My opinion is that building web applications that serve a network automation purpose is the ideal way to do it, but the time investment to learn web development is really big.
 So my questions are what are the use cases of network automation, what is the size of your company, and do scripts serve your needs or have you needed to build web applications that are shareable/usable by a wider audience.
 I have my Devnet associate and I am fairly adept at scripting, but when I see people like John Capobianco and Devnet Dan combining web development with network automation, I feel like I can’t even say I’m in the network automation space.
 Sure, I can commit my time to learning a bit of web development, but with so many vendor and open source tools dedicated to network automation, I don’t want to commit to something that may not have a big payoff.

 So we have our DB (AWS Aurora) and app (AWS) in private subnets. DB is only accessed through the app or our Redash.
 Recently, during a security meeting, it came up that how we detect data leaks or breaches.
 Currently, the only way we can detect a security risk is by Cloudtrail logs, which logs who accessed the DB credentials (from Secrets Manager). There are only 2 DB users: app user and redash user (read only). 
 How do you guys secure and monitor DB breaches or leaks? Any tools?
 Thank you.

 To segregate this traffic, what would the best approach? Adding a more specific route for the Internet traffic for this customer ?

 Title is pretty much the question. Assuming the device is still in warranty is anyone moving to a 4 year cycle from 3?
 It just doesn't seem like the upgrade every 3 years actually provides much benefit. CPU improvements really seem to be quite small, and everyone already has 16GB of Memory. Feels like there is better things I could be doing with the budget that frees up.

 I'm planning on setting up a toolkit to bring with me to help avoid making unnecessary trips to pick up tools and odds and ends when troubleshooting and servicing devices.
 I'm thinking I'll need the following; - Macbook Air, provisioned by my workplace - iPhone, provisioned by my workplace - USB-C Hub - HDMI and DisplayPort cables - Medicat and Ventoy USB sticks - Mini Leatherman - Screwdriver set - Keyboard and Mouse
 I'm wondering if other folks here have experience working in a similar situation; and have any advice on other things I should keep for support purposes. Likewise any tips and advice for working on a large campus that you regularly cross.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any infoblox experts around? I'm just trying to get an idea of how manageable our ib upgrade project is, whether it's something we can do ourselves or will we need pro services. 
 So the scenario is 40% percent of our boxes (4 appliances) are or will be eol soon. Unfortunately that includes the master. In order to not have to change the dhcp/ntp/dns settings on a slew of devices, we'll have to re-ip the candidate box. I've documented all the boxes involved: where they're connected, vlans, IP addresses. That's how far I've gone. The new boxes are already in prod by the way. Let's just say the guy who was the admin for this has left abruptly, mid-deployment
 The part I'm not too familiar with is the backend. What will I need; configs, dns, etc that will make this transition as smooth as possible?

Typically, in these situations I VLAN off said device with Catalyst switches and a Meraki MX so that they can access the Internet when needed for remote access but are isolated from any other internal devices.
 This particular machine, however, MUST communicate with a shared drive on a Windows Server (I know). I am trying to come up with a plan to reduce the threat. We are waiting on the manufacturer to upgrade the system but they are taking a while to develop software to work on anything else. I have tried OneDrive but the app won't work which requires the users to log in each time they need a file. Any ideas?

If I run a continuous ping from any device on the LAN to anything on the WAN, at random points throughout the day, it will just time out. The Time outs may happen once every so often or may be as dramatic as cutting in and out like crazy for several minutes Users are noticing the outages and having trouble loading web apps for work. The only thing that is consistent is that all the devices on the LAN are facing the issue. The Gateway is a SonicWall, and no devices ever have trouble pinging it. The issues occur pinging the outside world. I am confident that it is an ISP issue with ether a faulty connection outside the facility or hardware issue however I want to rule out anything I can on my LAN to make sure nothing is eating the bandwidth of the connection or something else I am not thinking of.
 TLDR: Want to make sure I have all my bases covered on network outages for MSP client.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[City: Vancouver Canada.
 I was looking at jobs on LinkedIn recently, and saw IT Analyst positions requiring at least 5 years of experience. What were they paying? $55-70k CAD. This is $40k-55k USD BEFORE tax. Tax in Canada is very high.
 Rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in this city is about 2000 CAD. If you were making a wage like this, you'd barely have any savings after expenses.
 It used to be that working IT gave you a comfortable wage - for companies to openly advertise these kind of wages is absolutely brutal. They must be doing this because so many candidates would reject them purely on this. Which brings me to the next point: people that knowingly apply for these roles are desperate and being taken advantage of. I would say don't get taken advantage of but when you are desperate....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working with a healthcare-related entity in need of a cloud-based VPN solution. The main purpose is to provide secure access to a web-based SaaS application. Specifically, we require a VPN that offers static IP addresses for all users to comply with the SaaS provider's IP whitelist requirements.
 Moreover, we need the VPN client to support split-tunneling to allow local network devices and resources to be accessed when necessary. It would be ideal if split-tunneling could be achieved using FQDNs rather than just IPs.
 Our total user count will be around 50, and as a cloud-based company, we do not have any on-premises equipment. Our users are distributed, working from either their homes or shared office spaces.
 So far I've looked at:
  
Cloudflare: It looks like a promising option, especially with the freemium plan that suits our user count. I would love to hear your opinions on this.
 ZScaler: I'm in the process of scheduling a call with their sales representative to get more information.
 Netmaker: This option is based on WireGuard and seems promising, but I'm keen to know if any of you have experience using it.
  Palo Alto Prisma Access: While it fits our needs, the minimum requirement of 200 user licenses might be cost-prohibitive for us.
 Palo Alto VM-series firewall in Azure: Unfortunately, I don't have a frame of reference on Azure costs, so any insights would be helpful.
 NordVPN: Not a suitable option as it does not support split-tunneling, as confirmed by their representative.
  Perimeter81: I'm not familiar with this company, but it was referred to me by NordVPN.
  
Are there any other good VPN providers out there?

 Our Cisco router has:
 router bgp XXXXX
 bgp log-neighbor-changes

 neighbor E.F.G.H remote-as YYYY
 neighbor E.F.G.H route-map localonly out
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
 ip address A.B.C.1 255.255.255.0 
 Our Palo Alto firewall WAN interface to public internet is configured with IP/CIDR as A.B.C.2/24 and it has a default route via A.B.C.1.
 We now want to set up an AWS Direct Connection using A.B.C.254/31 (.254 on our firewall and .255 on the AWS router). We are using the private ASN 64512.
 Instructions from Amazon have us configuring an interface on the firewall (actually a subinterface with VLAN tagging) using the A.B.C.254/31 address before setting up BGP.
 However, the firewall does not allow this since the new interface has an overlapping subnet with the WAN interface.
 What's the best thing to do here?
 1. I am thinking we would change the netmask on the Cisco router to 255.255.255.128 and change the firewall WAN link to /25. Yes?
 2. But then we're only advertising addresses .1-128 to the Internet, and .254-.255 to AWS. What would be the best way to tell the firewall and router to keep using .129-253 for our public WAN link?

They'll randomly throw a message saying: 
 "Because of an error in data encryption, this session will end. Please try connecting to the remote computer again."
 The Windows 11 PC and the Server 2012 R2 servers have been fully patched and all Windows updates installed. 
 The most recently attempt was to start the Link-Layer Topology Discovery Mapper service which was set to manual, but that did not help.
 Any suggestions?

 With that said, we have a team that has built a Grafana dashboard for some metrics and telemetry data for non-network gear within our footprint. I was thinking of getting assistance from him to help build one for the network. I just don't know what's supported, so for those that have done this already, what information do you have on there?
 I figure device uptime, maybe bandwidth statistics for our core, some interface statistics. Anything else that would be helpful and relevant? I understand it could differ from network to network, but just trying to get a feel overall of what you all use for your dashboard.
 Any info would be appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So long story short we had a "pentest" by our cyber insurance company which seems like they just did a basic port scan. 
 ​
 They are highly concerned to the point where they may not give us coverage because of this:
 ​
 They found port 443 open on our Cisco router for our VPN. They can go to the external IP and it resolves to a cisco page (X.X.X.X/+CSCOE+/logon.html). If you have credentials for that portal, you can download the Cisco Anyconnect client. I went to an external network and tried it. I couldn't find any other functionality to that page other than the client download. 
 ​
 All of this stuff was set up long before my time at the company, but is this not standard? From my understanding the router portal is a feature that was put there on purpose. 
 ​
 They are really insisting that we shut down access to port 443. I am really insisting that closing that port would render our VPN services non-existent. 
 Are they being idiots? Am I being an idiot? Are we all being idiots? VPNs and routers are NOT my strong suit so I'm worried I'm missing something obvious. 
 Should I stand my ground that this guy who did the port scan doesn't understand VPNs?

Despite several reports to proofpoint with permalinks to the offending emails and a description of the problem they are still coming and I had to block that domain, but it will only stop them until they change to another domain. I am also filtering for the phrase "Please Protect your account" the subjects so far have been userfirstname.userlastname, Please Protect your account, with the same thing showing up as the first line in the email
 I have saved the .eml files for several dozen of these emails and sent them to Amazon EC2 abuse and they have been extremely unhelpful. You would think they would want to stop these assholes as it is making them look bad for allowing it to happen. I am to the point of just blocking all emails coming from any amazon aws or ec2 site.
 If I block .png attachments it will probably mess up email signatures that use png files.
 It is getting annoying, as these emails sail right through Microsoft's defender phishing detection and through proofpoint since they are using a png file to try to trick people into falling for the phish.

 So I'm in the process of inheriting a network that has been touched by a few pairs of hands in the past couple years. The main person who has been managing it for the past 27 years is retiring, but has been dealing with some health issues in recent months, so someone else had been somewhat managing the network in the interim.
 I have lots of respect for the guy retiring, but he had some very bad practices that I'm now having to grapple with. We've been given a /24 of public IPs, and he has quite a few things assigned to them that really should not be. The interim netadmin partially implemented DHCP, but once he left and the main guy came back, he started rolling it back, but without fully applying the static IPs th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 Posting here as I was encouraged by you all last time. 
 The foster care charity I am a volunteer at (I work with/support Foster Dads) has asked if I would be able to help try to find laptops again for foster kids going back to school. My company marketing department helped me make a flyer and post on LinkedIn to try to collect any decommissioned machines from anyone. I kept it pretty brief for LinkedIn sake, but if anyone does have some laptops, they'd be happy to donate to get repurposed for foster Kids in the Denver area, I would gladly take them and send you a tax write off letter for your trouble. 
 Linkedin Post: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090341579864903680/
 FAQ (for IT people): 
  
Yes, we are happy to take laptops without hard drives. 
 We cannot take desktops as foster kids move around a lot and this makes it hard for them to transport, but I can connect you with a charity that does if you'd like.

In May we had a switch die and that point to point on the main building was on that switch. We were able to copy the exact config of the port that was on the dead switch to a different switch. But now whenever somebody from our main building calls the annex it's just dead noise. 
 You can receive the call while over there and we have traced the packets, but its not sending information back over from the annex. Here's the kicker, if the annex calls out to the main building everything works fine, you can see the packets transferring like the…]]></summary>

 We are currently setting up a captive portal for our new wireless using aruba clearpass. We are having issues getting it working and from my understanding it has something to do the cert. We can reach the captive portal and register, but after that, we get a blank page.
 What does a certificate have to do with this, considering its an inside hosted page we are reaching? Why will it not work without a certificate? And on top of that, why does it have to be a a legit purchases cert, and not a self signed or self generated one?

 I'd like to carve off a hunk for work only, isolated/sandboxed, AzureAD joined, with tighter controls, hardened, etc. 
 90% of what I do is live in a browser for work, with some remote access (RDP, win32 based remote control app, PuTTY, that's about it) and obviously Office 365 (Outlook, OneDrive, Teams)
 My first thought was Windows 11 Sandbox, but persistence would be an issue, although I could probably spin up an image that's preloaded; I'm not sure if that's supported.
 There is obviously Hyper-V, but I'm not sure how well it would perform for webcam pass-thru, general video performance, etc.
 Figured I'd ask before reinventing the wheel...

More specifically it performs a DNS (Domain Name System) query for a SRV (Service) record. It will then make a connection to the domain controller. If this is all successful, the domain profile is set..
  
It says it will make a connection to “the” domain controller. What if that specific domain controller is offline, inaccessible, rebooting etc. at that exact moment? It will assign the network as a Public and set the windows Firewall to the Public Network profile.
 How often will it retry again and will it keep trying the same DC host from its local DNS cache or will it do a new query getting the same DC over and over from the SRV lookup or should it get different DC entry from the SRV record with each new query?

 Many start-ups and large companies hold sales of their products and give discounts. I searched the internet and found a few such offers, which might be useful to someone:
 Linux Foundation offers 50% on bootcamps, training courses and certifications. 
 Getscreen.me remote desktop give 25% discount on first subscription. 
 PrinterLogic is giving away free t-shirts for sysadmins.
 Cafepress presents gifts for sysadmins (you can finally buy a new mug!:-))

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone else seen a persistent issue with using Zoom on a laptop connected to a dock where as soon as someone jumps off a Zoom meeting and into a Teams meeting the external camera (e.g., Logitech webcam, conference room Logitech cameras) will have issues (e.g., freezing, blurred)? We haven't seen it consistently but it's happened enough times to get our attention. A reboot seems to resolve the issue but that sometimes isn't possible with back-to-back conference meetings.

 Please help, because I am missing something...
 I have one tenant (source) to which guest users are invited. We have configured MFA for all accounts including members and guest users. One company we depend on, have some stubborn users (~100) who claim they don't have corporate phones and they do not wish to set up SMS or MS Auth app on private phones. We don't want to exclude those users. How to handle that? 
 AFAIK - FIDO2 keys are not an option along with OATH hardware tokens - Microsoft doesn't support that for guest accounts. 
 Maybe software tokens? What do you think?

They're printing to Xerox B400, I've already tried updating the firmware and drivers, but still not able to print more then once without having to reset the printer. Just wondering if anyone else ran into something similar? I've already tried with Dell support and they couldn't find much.

 I'd like to advertise BCE to the user base but am concerned that, on the occasion that a user is not signed in to Edge with their work account, they can just plonk any sensitive data they fancy in to the generic (unprotected) Bing Chat. 
 The only method of ensuring this looks to be to force Edge sign-in. This would be acceptable if edge didn't crash as soon as you enable the account filter GPO to only allow logins to *@contoso.com. 
 Any one had a different/better experience?

 for some time now i have a problem with our NetDrives for users connected via VPN. The users get the following error message:
 "Microsoft Windows Network: The local device name is already in use. This connection has not been restored."
 The mapped drives are shares on a Windows Server 2022 and are connected to the clients via GPO. The users connect to our company network with the Watchguard SSL Client. The drives work without any problems for everyone inside our company network, but not when connected via VPN. When i try to connect to the Server manually it works just fine. At the moment i gave the users a script, which removes all NetDrives and connects them again. The wierd thing is it works sometimes for some users, what makes me think its some kind of DNS error. I would appreciate every tip i can get, thanks.

 We have an infrastructure of around 800 switches.
 For better control, I recently set up a netdisco server. Everything works fine except one point. Ours routers (Nexus nx-os series 9k) do not generate the lldp cards with ours switches (procurve, aoscx, h3c).
 We asked for help on the netdisco forum, had good answers activated the cdp at their request but nothing worked.
 Yet when we do a "show lldp neighbors" on the router directly, everything looks good.
 Has anyone already encountered the problem?
 Thanks in advance
 PS: sorry for my english,

 Connecting out to a 3rd party provider via an nginx proxy, they very kindly changed the IP address behind their URL without telling us. Nginx never updated the resolution and we had to reload config on the proxy servers to force an update.
 Easy fix in the end but a nightmare to get there. Documentation will be updated.

 With that, looking to buy a laserjet that does color, duplex, wired (don't want to deal with wifi dying eventually or losing its mind) and or usb. Photocopy would be ideal. Don't need scanning...
 Use is for home business for recipes, labels and home school photocopying. Ideally a limit of $500 or less. I don't mind buying older printers on ebay or the like if they are solid models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a fan of OneDrive with KFM turned on as a "user data" solution (although I wasn't a fan of sharepoint). Worked very well at a previous spot. Now I'm in a new spot that uses Box for cloud file storage (which is GREAT as a sharepoint replacment but garbage as a OneDrive replacement). 
 Has anyone successfully used Box AND OneDrive? I'm thinking of using Box for cloud file storage and collab but silently turning on OneDrive with KFM solely to automatically back up documents/desktop/pictures. We are an E3 shop, so we have OneDrive already, the sync client has just been disabled via dism during task sequence (don't ask). So essentially OneDrive is there, but only in the cloud. 
 Unfortunately, I don't have the option to move the org OFF of Box. I'm trying to simplify refreshing PCs where now the techs are "manually backing up user data from a C drive" to a temporary file share, then manually copying it back down on the new PC (like it's 1999 LOL) 
 Anyone have any experience with both?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm feeling a mix of emotions as I write this post. After an entire year of unemployment due to being laid off from my previous job because of downsizing, I finally received a job offer from a new company. Initially, it felt like a glimmer of hope amidst the struggles, nightmares, and exhausting ordeal of the recruiting process.
 However, my excitement turned to severe disappointment when I realized I had fallen victim to a bait-and-switch situation. Throughout the hiring process, the recruiter assured me that the job was fully remote, which was crucial for me. But at the final stages of the interview, they dropped the bombshell that it's an onsite job, and I could only negotiate remote work after three months.
 I feel utterly lied to and betrayed, especially after enduring countless rejections and navigating the recruiting hell. It's frustrating to finally receive an offer, only to discover that it's not what was promised.
 This deceit has left me feeling so angry that it triggered a migraine, and it's taken all my strength to write this post seeking your advice and assistance. I don't know what to do next. I'm desperate for some guidance as I navigate this challenging decision.

 In my lab, this is my current setup. The two core switches are MLAG'd together w/ VRRP for core redundancy, that's fine and works great.
 For the edge/access setup, I have two /30 interconnecting VLANs with OSPF interface enabled as P2P. On our current network, this is how we do it with RIP. I then have two default routes, one pointing to the core's SVI on each link for redundancy. It works, but it's slow(ish) to rebuild OSPF routes when one of the links go down.
 An option I had in mind was potentially setting up a VRRP in a /29 for the SVI's and then MLAG'ing the ports on the core, with a static route on the edge to the VRRP address - but it feels like I'm reinventing the wheel somewhat and overcomplicating.
 If you were setting up a new edge/access in your network, how would you do the redundancy which offers the best speed and convergence time?
 Any help/guidance would be much appreciated, thanks. :)

 We are running a 50 employee company and want a VPN solution for travel, allowing for better security on public and hotel wifis.
  
Computers: all Win10 22H2, soon starting W11 upgrade
 On-prem: A office network only, that is barely used (employees are rarly working from office)
 No datacenter or servers
 Microsoft 365 with email, sharepoint, onedrive and the usual
 Some other cloud services too, such as invoicing and time tracking
  
Is configuring a point-to-site VPN i Azure might be overkill and more expensive than necessary?
 If possible, I'd like to avoid purchasing 50 [insert (shady) VENDORNAME] VPN solution licences and deploying those manually.
 Right now, we are instructing our employees to use 4/5G mobile data, and not connect to those public and hotel Wifi networks. This works fine in Europe, but for travels outside the EU, the economics breaks the solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've noticed this strange issue a few times over the last couple months. When my users send an email with an attachment internally, Message Trace shows that it grows by roughly 5%, I assume due to encoding and headers. However, when sending outside the org, the growth is more like 50%.
 I've had users send emails to external orgs with an attachment that's ~28MB in size. But by the time it leaves Exchange servers, Message Trace shows that it's sitting at ~38MB. This is above the default size limit of 35, so the messages are then rejected by recipients (and the icing on the cake, the sender doesn't get a bounce back).
 Has anyone else suffered this issue and found solutions or information as to what's going on?

He went into work and an hour later was told and locked out of the offices etc. Now, my friend was the sole point of contact for MFA for all the company's clients admin accounts in various portals/admin centres,, be it via authenticator app or mobile number and we were discussing what happens now if he is contacted regarding access to clients. 
 He's saying if contacted he will pass on the info at a charge ad he doesn't work for free. I think he will have to just pass them on or face a legal challenge or withholdal of redundancy pay or potentially Microsoft will unlock the accounts based on the company closing. 
 Anyone had this scenario play out?

I kinda miss when everything was just VGA and you didn't have to go hunting for adapters every time you want to plug a PC into a monitor. I'm sure there are advantages to all these new connectors, but simplicity ain't one of them.

 My boss is thinking to move all of our equipment to a Data Center due to costs. In this case we would need to purchase a new STX as our data center gateway. After digging around, I've started to wonder who does organisations connect their campus l2 network with the Data Center one.
 I am familiarised with MPLS VPLS, VPN-2-VPN or even VXLAN. We are not thinking of using MPLS as it would include ISP costs, so in this case what is the best way to connect our users, iot devices, cameras and smart devices which they are on their own vlan on campus to the servers on the data center? I am trying to avoid l3 connectivity between both, although the underlay network is l3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was hired last year to be the principal engineer over a local on prem env along with cloud engineer duties. The on prem really is a simple env and doesn't take much time but internal Infra does fall under it. They needed a dedicated person to "run point". 
 We have an MSP they've used for years and they are really good most of the time. Their head engineer passed away. He was who I worked with most.
 My boss and the CTO want to roll out Intune since we're 365 and our licenses are right. 
 I'm in the very early stages of building policies and testing them. They want the initial policies simple and aimed at mobile devices. So IOS and Android.
 I created an Android policy, tested it on my phone, and made notes.
 I went to create a Conditional Access Policy and didn't have the rights. So I reached out to ask for them. 
 The engineer called me and made me second guess myself. He wanted to knkw why I needed a conditional access policy and not just a device policy.
 And I still don't understand the question or logic behind it. Because if I create Device Policies but not Conditional Access Policy - there would be nothing in place to force people to enroll their devices. The device policies would be pointless.
 Maybe he didn't understand I was testing. But I said the word testing multiple times.
 Am I nuts? I need a Conditional access Polocy or it's all moot, correct?
 If I want to not allow users to be able to use say 365 apps on their phone unless their device is enrolled and compliant - I need a conditional access policy forcing them to enroll their device.
 I think I'm just fried for the day and need to take off early and reset. Because this seems like a no brainer to me.

I was able to learn a lot within that year, but after he left the company, I felt like I started to stagnate. The management was also god-awful, and wanted to get out ASAP. 
 I left the company earlier this year and got a job as desktop support that pays me almost double what I was making at the old place. I feel I'm making much more than what is typical for this kind of position, especially considering I'm doing far less than I was at my previous job. 
 I'm happy about getting a livable wage, but it feels like I'm hurting myself more in the long run by taking the de facto "demotion". Nothing I've done in the past month or so of being here is something I couldn't teach my mom how to do in a few hours. 
 Any thoughts regarding this? 
 TL;DR: I'm making more money, but feel like I'm wasting time not increasing the value of my resume.

I'm not necessarily talking about just for one system, because that can be put in the systems documentation. I'm referring to like, bigger issues related to ALL HP printers with a certain firmware / model, or maybe a new Windows bug like AppReadiness slowing logins. It doesn't affect everyone but maybe it should be noted somewhere in case someone runs into this issue or maybe it should be posted because it needs someone to keep an eye on it, like in the case of a 'laravel.log' growing to be way to big, which might require someone to manually move that file(s) elsewhere.
 Just wondering. We don't have a place for 'just so you're aware' and I don't know what to do with some info that might be useful to some other techs. Think like a bulletin board with notes or papers on it with information

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We rolled out Confluence at work a few years ago. As much as I despise the app (as compared to other wikis), I like the idea of one company-wide IT central point of knowledge. We're a large Enterprise IT shop and there are lots of teams I need to interact with, each with their own procedures and methods of engagement. With each one having their own Confluence space, I now go to one place to search for documentation.
 But no one seems to understand the concept of a wiki. In a wiki you LINK TO OTHER PAGES. So, when you're trying to document the process you go to to build a new Azure VM, you should link to the Azure provisioning team, and not create your own documentation. Cause whatever you have might be out of date very quickly.
 So, now I go to Confluence and search "provision Azure SLES VM" and I get 20 different pages that come up, some defining of procedure that went out of date 2 YEARS AGO.
 I went through my teams Wiki and removed any documentation that didn't involve something my team does, and replaced it with links to documentation from the team that does that work. And everyone got mad at me.
 I give up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Cisco 9200. I am totally lost and left wondering what I could be doing wrong. 
 The switch has a few VLANS and those VLANS have SVIs acting as default gateways for clients in those VLANS. There is also a routed port on the Cisco switch that is connected directly to another layer 3 switch. 
 For reference the routed port on the Cisco switch is 10.17.6.252. The IP of the port it’s connecting to on the other layer 3 switch is 10.17.6.253. The Cisco switch can ping .253. 
 All the clients off of the VLAN SVIs are able to ping the routed port on the Cisco .252 but are unable to reach .253. I am needing clients in the VLANS to be able to reach .253. 
 I have set up static routes…
 ip route 10.17.6.253 255.255.255.255 Gi1/0/9 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.17.6.253
 Gi1/0/9 is the routed port on the Cisco that’s directly connected to the .253 port on the other layer 3 switch. 
 Is there something simple I am missing? I am not understanding why .253 is reachable from the switch itself, but not from any clients connected to the switch. Did I mess up my routes or is there something else? 
 Thanks for any help you can offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Today is the second time this happens to me and I am not really sure why.
 We had a remote device connected to our core network that went down due an electrical issue. When that issue was solved, we could see the interfaces became up but there was still no IP connectivity between the remote router and core router, no ping between them and, consequently, no BGP session. 
 I tried resetting the BGP, doing shut/no shut to port at core end but the issue was remaining. 
 We have CDP disable due internal policies, but I enabled it to see if the devices were seeing each other at L2 and, suddenly, connectivity was recovered and BGP session became up. 
 I guess when I enabled CDP, traffic was generated through the interface and remote MAC learnt (I did not check MAC address table prior enabling CDP), but I don't really know why it needed to generate traffic to learn it.
 The other thing I could see during the issue was BGP state toggling between Active and Idle. 
 This is the second time something similar happens to me, the other time was during a migration from an old core router to a newer one, when connected to the new core there was no IP connectivity until CDP was enable.
 Does anyone have an idea of what could be the reason I needed to enable CDP to provide IP connectivity between the devices? 
 Thanks in advance for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening from where I am. Quick question. Work related I have to setup a chain of like 6 switches (💀) in order to share a certain network. 
 This setup stays for around 3 days. The strange thing is that sometimes, not really regularly, the switches tend to either don’t get link from the previous one, or loose the link to the next one. My quick solution is to restart the switches which always works. But it’s annoying because sometimes it’s more of them so my daily morning routine often is to go to all of them and restart them. 
 My question now is, what can cause this? I know 6 switches in a row is a nono but there is no way around. It sadly has to be like this. Can it be the switches caching too much data or what could it be? 
 Thanks for the help if someone can help and have a nice day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’ve run into a problem and I’ll try to be brief.
 The company I work for has a HA firewall setup and has two ISP with a main ISP (router A) and a secondary ISP (router B)
 I was doing a fail over test yesterday and it did not fail over properly to router B. There was no internet. So I started troubleshooting.
 I plugged a laptop up the the secondary firewall and still nothing. I plug the laptop into router B directly and it was working with no issue, mind you DHCP is on. I ran tracert to see if I am getting out and I am. 
 I look on ip chicken to grab my ip and this is where I’m confused. While still plugged into router B, My public ip is the same as the gateway address my ISP has given me.
 At this point I try to put the information from my ISP as static, when I do that it seems like it works for a bit then it just stops working. I swap to DHCP and it start working again.
 I’ve contacted my ISP and they were no help telling me everything I already knew. Such as what my ip, gateway address and subnet is.
 Supposedly per the ISP our ip is 54.82.137.233 and our gateway is 54.82.137.234 (obviously this is not ours but it follows the same template, they are both public) and our subnet is 255.255.255.252
 I’ve contacted our fire wall team and once again has confirmed our gate way is 54.82.137.234 but it’s also the public. Last resort I was going to get them to rebuild the interface but I’m still so confused on why the public is also the gateway.
 I need help understanding this. I’ve looked everywhere yet no answers. Mind you we have done failover test before with no issues.
 If there is stuff I need to clarify, let me now but any help is appreciated.

 The tenant I'm working on belongs to a very small Nonprofit organization that benefits from some free Business Premium accounts. Remaining users can have Business Standard licensing.
 Let's assume that I have a mixed environment, where a few users are on Business Premium and others are on Business Standard.
 Security Defaults is enabled at the moment which is useful for many reasons, main one being automatically enforced MFA.
 Now, would I be able to disable Security Defaults and use Conditional Access for everyone? (I mean without any extra cost)
 My objectives:
  
Allow users to still have MFA (either enforced automatically or enabled manually for each user, which I don't mind doing because it's only a few users).
 Be able to send email with one specific account, using a third party web tool that supports SMTP authentication (it's possible according to this article).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends,
 Sorry for the lame title - I am not sure how to best summarize this. We have a 10g connection to Equinix fabric using a fabric "Port". Riding across that fabric are multiple "Connections" that are lower bandwidth. Since my layer-2 connection is 10g there is nothing to hold back transmission other than the policer for the fabric Connection. Is there anything I should do to policy the outbound traffic before putting it on the Equinix fabric to protect my data? I am sending syslogs across this path, and there is no current option for making those logs use a reliable protocol. Is there anything I can do to prevent or minimize the policer drops from losing those log packets? If TCP it would drop and kick off the whole TCP retry process. Bit since UDP there's just no way. 
 Right now I'm just watching the bandwidth with a 60-second graph and we're not going over 50% of our allocated bandwidth. I'm worried about the unexpected bursts due to some security event and then losing that fidelity. Is there anything I can do to help? Or is just more bandwidth the only answer outside of switching to a log relay with (more) reliable TCP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I applied for an apprenticeship for a small IT company two and a half years ago as a Junior System Administrator. Since this was my first real experience in the IT industry (I did an internship as a Help Desk Technician for another company for a year), I was pretty excited at first, but after a year and a half, I noticed that I spent most of my time troubleshooting common user problems (e.g. resetting domain and/or e-mail passwords, setting up PCs, etc.); there were also times when I did actual System Administrator work (e.g. setting up a firewall, setting up and checking on backup activities, etc.), but those times were extremely rare (even now). I've also noticed a lot of internal problems which were brought up but never fixed can be listed as follows:
 - All of us are forced to use personal phones for work; after bringing such a thing up both my boss and management explicitly told me that if I don't like it, I can always buy a new phone that I can use for work at my own expense.
 - At the same time, both my boss and management adore splurging money on parties and other such things.
 - As soon as work is lightly inconvenient everyone expects me to deal with it.
 - They also expect me to both clean other people's messes AND do my job at the same time.
 - All of the things I've learned so far I've learned on my own (except for a few things).
 - Whenever I try to complain about those problems with my boss or management I'm met with empty promises.
 Should I keep going? Or should I just try to land a new job somewhere else? Right now I'm trying to learn Red Hat Enterprise Linux and I'll probably try to set up a home lab so I can start learning how to manage an IT infrastructure since I'm not learning anything new at my current workplace...

 We have a decent amount of laptops that every patch cycle take hours of work to get our Helpdesk to track down and make sure they are getting updates. Sometimes they will be months behind making it even more of an issues. 
 What I do not want, is a laptop to be away for a while miss a critical update cycle and then join our network. Right now, we make sure devices are removed from the domain after a certain amount of days. I believe its 90 days. 
 But with the way security patches are going, some of these updates are seeming to be more critical and coming faster and waiting 3 months seems like too long. 
 How do you guys handle User accountability to making sure these get proper updates in reasonable time frame? 
 I am starting to consider locking them off the network to force them to call but not sure what a reasonable time for this lockout would be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm looking for solution to connect 1 main office and 4-5 branches with site2site VPN and less then 100 employees with direct VPN.
 Preferably being able to use one DNS server so everyone could access all the internal services in the main office without additional settings regardless of location. 
 Right now we are using ubiquity solution and it sucks, quite often users can't connect directly, but it could be "fixed" by restarting VPN service. 
 Main office is around 50people and one internet connection around 250Mbps, and branches are around 10-20 people with at most the same internet speed. And branches often use access to the file server in the main office to transfer large amounts of data, so at least 50Mbps is required. 
 Right now I'm looking at cisco 900 and cisco 1000 series, but I would be very glad to get any suggestions from someone more experienced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys
 I've been given a project that was someone else work. the guy left but started half way.
 The design that he came up with was that each switch would have its own layer 2 network. switch 1 vlan 110 (172.21.111.0/24), switch 2 vlan 112 (172.21.112.0/24) and so on.
 This can get a bit tedious to manage but my manager said in bigger networks this is the way we do things. 
 All SVI's will terminate to the core switch and then hit the transit network out the ASA.
 One of my colleagues has suggested just spanning a /23 subnet across all switches as this will be simpler to configure and manage. 
 I think that i need a mixure of both. Group switches in group of 4, one vlan for each group of 4 switches. Group 1, vlan 110 (172.21.111.0/24) group 2 (172.21.112.0/24). SVI's will still terminate to the core and then using the transit VLAN bounce out to the internet.
 What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't ask me why I am doing this haha but I am trying to setup a lab for a production environment.
 I have an older 2 Port Cisco 1800 router, inside interface 192.168.2.1, outside interface 172.16.1.100. The Outside interface is connected to a Hotspot with an ethernet port configured for IP passthrough. The hotspot is connected to my outside interface of the cisco router, the hotspot IP address is 172.16.1.1 which is my cisco routers gateway. I also have a switch connected to the ciscos inside interface which that switch interface is 192.168.2.2. From the cisco router I CAN ping internet addresses through the hotspot. This is because the source is the 172.x network. When I source the ping from the inside interface, 192.x network I get no replies. From my switch I can ping the outside interface of the router, 172.x but obviously not the Hotspot gateway of 172.16.1.1. I was thinking I needed to setup NAT on my router so I setup an access list to permit all traffic, setup nat inside source to the outside interface and configured the 2 ethernet ports from inside/outside natting. Not luck.
 I"m sure this sounds confusing but any help would be appreciated. It's probably something simple I am missing. I just can't ping from the 192.x network to the 172.x gateway on the hotspot. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question how you would implement the following:
 We are part of a large corporation and communication to the internet goes first through our own firewall that does segmentation (FortiGate 201F) only and then through the big coperation firewall.
 This is at least for our internal clients.
 Dual, we still have a DSL internet connection+router with no special firewall.
 This connection provides internet for visitors or special purposes like EC-card readers, which would not work properly through the big cooperation firewall.
 These two networks are separated by vlans.
 Normal Clients:
 Client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> Own firewall for segmentation (FortiGate 201F) -> Coperate firewall -> Internet.
 Would it now make more sense to configure a Vlan directly connected to the DSL router (which then also handles DHCP) and distribute it to the other switches:
 Zero Trust Client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> DSL Router -> Internet
 ... or connect the DSL router to our own segmentation firewall FortiGate 201F, which then provide the DHCP service and forwards it to the DSL router as next hop?
 Zero Trust client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> own firewall for segmentation (FortiGate 201F) -> DSL Router -> Internet
 The thing is, this DSL internet is not only for visitors but also for our own EC-card readers, so I would like to segment them extra, either on the dsl router or the firewall.
 And I don't know, if a simple home router will keep up with +200 leases at the same time and so on.

 Switch: Tplink TL-SG3428X (1g/10g) or TPlink TL-SG3428X-M2 (2.5g/10g)
 looking into getting this switch it mentions uplink of 10g for the sfp ports but little confused on what the speeds are for downlink between the 4 10gb sfp ports?
 Does this mean its going to be capped at 2.5gb since thats what the main ports are capped at? or is it 10gb both ways for all sfp ports and capped at 2.5g down on the main eth ports?
 If someone could confirm or provide clarity that would be awesome as im interested in picking one up depending on what that answer is.
 Thanks.

 I believe I know how to get the S switch into the proper mode. For the QSFP port, "interface breakout 1/1/25 map 10g-4x" should put it into the proper mode.
 But... what do I need to do on the N1500 switch? I'm assuming you have to configure the four 10Gb interfaces in some manner, you can't just plug all four cables in with no additional configuration and have it actually work, right? Do these four 10Gb interfaces need to go into a port group? Or is there other configuration needed to get this link to work?

 <add key="printServerPrinter" value="\\APPS-UATSVR\NPIFBCC54 (HP LaserJet MFP M430)"/>
 This program works when I run it on visual studio or even when I release it and run it via its .exe file. It has to run during work hours so I added it to Task Scheduler to start it to check something every minute and print when it found something. 
 The problem is if the program is started by the Task Scheduler It couldn't find the printer, it generates a pdf but can't send it to print on the printer since it couldnt find/open it. This is the error logged on a .txt file.
 2023-07-26 06:32:43:751191 Function:Main - Message:The printer named "\\APPS-UATSVR\NPIFBCC54 (HP LaserJet MFP M430)" could not be opened. Error code: 0
 If I start it normally there are no problems, as I have said earlier. I searched around the net but couldn't find an answer and i can't seem to debug this problem. I've tried many ways, changed the printer name, changed the port, change the backslash to forward slash but it still wont work.
 What seems to be the problem? Thank you very much in advance!

 This sounds like a major trunk was damaged. Does anyone else have any reports?
 ​
 EDIT: I just got off the phone with Consolidated Communications. They confirmed that this is a nation wide issue with Verizon, who is working to resolve. This is only affecting sites with PRIs for us.

 I'm fairly new to this and my manager gave me this task to play with to try and learn.
 So initially I was trying to set this policy to uninstall an application but it looks like all I did was remove the msi from the GPO? All I did was follow a youtube guide. This is an outlook addin/plugin that is made available to download from the network (not forced).
 I went to add the msi back to fix what I initially messed up but how do I find and select the file location when shared drives are not visible. Yes it is mapped and I am connected to the domain. Is there a special syntax to point to the file? 
 It's current location is: S:\folder1\folder2\folder3\filename.msi
 So then my last question is how do I set this to uninstall from user's devices, the easiest method?

 Last week, around the 19th, someone moved more data than usual to our SharePoint server and caused us to go over 100% storage capacity. Management wants to know who and what files/folders caused the issue.
 I'm more interested in some helpful info on how those of you with more experience in this would or do handle such tasks. I don't expect management to sign off on purchasing license(s) for 365 analytics so that is a no-go.
 I did do a Compliance Audit and searched for "File Upload" events on the date range and then used Excel and Pivot Tables to create a graph and identify the user that contributed the most "File Uploads" on that date.
 We are looking for an increase of 100-200 GB above the normal trend in the span of 1-2 days. Yes, I had a one-hour presentation months ago that I spent many nights working on late into the night to make them aware they would hit their SharePoint limit, provided costs and cost projections for staying in the cloud and buying more or getting a NAS and they decided that at 90% full they should be fine because I essentially refused to give them a date when they would reach 100% capacity...

I see csfalconservice.exe in their a lot but I think that's just triggered by TiWorker.exe trying to run or clean an install I can't quite tell when I've checked resource monitor I can see it calling packages in c\windows\servicing\packages some of these years old packages for RollupFix etc. I can literally pin point the time it will do this every hour. Monthly updates are working fine on the servers, just patched this week but I feel like it's still trying to either install or clean old packages and then crowdstrike goes crazy checking what the server is up to and these disk reads fly high. Anyone experienced anything similar? Is disk clean up an option?

Is there any way to do something like auto-run on a thumb drive to avoid this mind-numbing typing?

The Android they come with is pretty average, so I'm hoping to repurpose some older windows laptops to sit behind the TVs as an option for teachers to sign into their domain account and access their OneDrive/Office etc.
 The part I'm needing some help with is some ideas about how to make this work. Each TV (laptop) could have 15+ users and storage would fast become an issue. Additionally, teachers can be in 10+ classrooms which makes it annoying to sign into OneDrive /Teams/Office initially on each room.
 Ideally I'd like to have them run as a thin client and remote into a server so storage isn't an issue, OneDrive/Office is logged in etc. I don't have any experience with this though.
 Thoughts on this situation?

 Setting up a new tenant, and I've been told to restrict all teams groups invites internal and external, but allow instant messaging between certain domains.
 I've restricted all the inbound/outbound access and added the specific domains into the Teams admin centre however I am now hitting an issue.
 We will call the tenant I'm working on Tenant A and the external tenant Tenant B.
 Tenant A users cannot be invited to Tenant B nor invite anyone in Tenant B to Teams groups - great.
 Tenant A users can still send/receive Teams meetings to/from Tenant B users - great.
 Tenant A can initiate instant message conversations with Tenant B users - great
 Now we hit the issue, Tenant B users cannot initiate conversations with Tenant A. This is not a Tenant B issue as this tenant is very open. 
 ​
 Any ideas? I looked into the Tenant Restrictions Preview in Entra ID/AzureAD, but allowing Tenant B in there opens up the ability to invite to groups again, which we don't want.

 so I'm sitting at work, and you know how ones workplace evolves over time. So by this time I'm sitting in front of three screens plus open notebook (17 inch). For various reasons I've got one workstation connected to two screens while my notebook gets one extra screen. Additionaly I've got a 65' UHD screen in here as well, for monitoring and the occasional meeting. Some other stuff with screen outputs on my desk as well, not connected permanently but only if needed.
 So as you can guess, things get messy quickly. I was thinking about getting something like this: https://www.purelink.de/en/switcher-matrices/hdmi/3431/4x4-4k-18gbps-hdmi-matrix-with-scaler-and-audio-matrix to switch between the screens because it leaves me with way more flexibility than any standard kvm switch I found, as those either don't come as a matrix switcher or don't do multi screen setups well. Then I might combine that with some kind of USB Switch.
 My question to you guys is, has anyone run something like this? Any recommendations for multi screen, multi PC setups? Happy to hear any thoughts on my setup, also very interested in how everyone else has their desk setup!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some set up: User on a users VLAN is remoting into a production machine on the production VLAN using the production machine's domain user (NOT the user's domain user). The production VLAN is very tight in terms of browsing the web (completely cutoff really) and after the user is done remoting into the production machine and closes the session, he is also completely cutoff from browsing the web. Signing out and back in solves this but I would love to understand the process behind this phenomenon. I tried googling but I guess my keywords could be zoned in.
 I would really appreciate any and all input on this as it's driving the user crazy and thus, us as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just finished setting up Windows Failover Cluster on Server 2022.
 I'm using SCVMM to migrate the VMs from our current hypervisors (Hyper-V) to our new Windows Failover Cluster.I have a SAN with 2 volumes configured on it, one is 18TB and the other is 9TB.I've migrated successfully over a dozen of our smaller servers (no more than 200GB) without a problem. Not it's time to move a couple of our large file servers. 
 One of the File Services is about 852GB in size so should happily fit on either of the Cluster Shared Volumes (18TB or 9TB).When I try to migrate the VM to the Cluster it doesn't appear to see the free space on the cluster shared volumes and reports that there is not enough disk space (it looks like it's only looking at the free space on the C: drive).
 Screenshot of Migrate VM Wizard
 How do I get SCVMM to see the 18TB and 9TB worth of space available so I can successfully migrate our file servers to our shiny Windows Failover Cluster that has 27TB of space but wont see it?!
 Thanks.

 Effective October 1, 2023, the Azure grant is now USD2,000.

 When the Rioch and Lanier printers are added they install a tool called either Lanier Driver Utility or Ricoh Driver Utility. No idea why, I've tried all different print drivers to stop this but I cant seem to.

 There is some advantages of doing this, for example you can use cloudflare public dns as your name server which makes one less thing to maintain your lab environment etc. This domain is also brand and identity neutral.
 It served me well for many years, hope it does the same for the next owner.

 I'm not looking to learn everything about python in a single book or in a week, I'd rather read something that has a build approach and doesn't try to introduce everything by the time I get to chapter 3. That's how I feel most of the 'youtube' style video playlists I've watch are like...they start with the basics and by the fourth or fifth video they have already thrown in 10 different concepts and I'm still trying to digest what I watches in the first few videos.
 These are the two books I've heard a lot of good things about, but I would like to hear from this sub and hopefully someone who has been in my shoes in terms of 'no programming knowledge' here they are:

 Is there a generally widely accepted opinion regarding these for runs between closets? I plan on talking to our usual wiring guy when I see him next, but just wanted some opinions from here first.

 We have an Intranet that is ran through an MPLS circuit. I also have an internal network that’s local to our branch location.
 If I have the users remote from the branch, they’re going to come into our WAN-side interface. VPN network will be separate and will be serviced via DHCP on a Cisco switch. Assuming I route between the two networks (VPN network and LAN network) on the firewall, will there need be a NAT Exemption somewhere to make sure my LAN-side traffic doesn’t get NAT’d when trying to communicate with VPN clients?
 Also, is there a preference over SSLVPN versus IPSec? I understand they operate on different levels of the OSI model. Since it’ll be through AnyConnect, I assume we’d need to use IPsec.

 got the task of implementing a small OSPF (Palo/Cisco) in my company and this task arrived with the previous work of consultant and some implementation of a coleague on our cisco side. This previous work consists chunks of cisco configurations for OSPF and I'm trying to understand why he suggests in the configuration to create interface VLANS (SVIs) for OSPF between routers, he used passive default and then enabled OSPF directly on these interfaces (SVIs). My coleague apparently copied these configuration literaly to the actual router. The thing is that we already have /29 networks to route between routers so it looks like that we should be using those to form adjacencies. I'm not sure if he did that be cause he didn't have complete information of our topology (that's possible) or is it something I'm missing that should be done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a bright spark at my company ordered the wrong fibre optic couplers. We are trying to convert our profibus to fibre, but here's the kicker. The converter is for MM and the clients fibre run is SM fibre. How this passed the FAT I'll never know, but here we are. 
 There's a few constraints with this, namely the ATEX areas this equipment is in. We used Bartec as they had a full rated assembly for our needs, and was fully certified. Until we noticed the converters were the wrong type. 
 Time is of the essence, and as we need to try and solve this before we demobilise, I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas. Due to the ATEX area, ideally the fix will not be an active one (I.E. The fix cannot require power inputs) as this would likely invalidate the IECex rating, and we're back to square one. 
 The fibre is under 1k in length with a few splices (I'll need to Otdr for exact losses). 
 Would these work?

 Thanks in advance, we have until Friday to solve this one. Deep joy.

 I'm trying to upgrade our ancient virtual Netscaler Gateway from 12.0 (Build 59.8.nc). According to everything I've read online I need to upgrade to the last 12.1 build before upgrading to 13.0 and then 13.1. https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX549397/how-to-upgrade-citrix-adc-stepbystep
 12.1 isn't supported anymore and I can't find the files for the last 12.1 build on Citrix.com.
 Can I upgrade to the latest 13.0 build directly?
 It's only used to access our old XenApp farm from Internet.

 Adobe support forums indicate there is a registry change (which doesn't exist), and a setting in Outlook that can stop this from happening (which doesn't work).
 I resolved this issue by modifying the Adobe Install (appwiz.cpl), and removing the outlook add-in.
 We don't want Adobe uploading our files to their grubby little cloud, we pay money to Adobe so we can edit PDF files; that's it.

 you can always connect externally, outside of their office during these outages but users inside the office get the error and each time, so far without fail if you restart the server it starts working again, the issue then seems to go away for anywhere from 1 day - 2 weeks but always comes back.

 Looking for some advice as a basic user of stabket (service desk user with no admin rights). 
 I use stablenet daily for my job to check on switches that may have gone down, but would like to know if there is any way as a basic user to dig deeper and see things such as the port a user device is connected to (laptop etc) as the end user's often dont know and any other things that are useful to know as a user with limited knowledge on the system. 
 From what I've read it seems I would need admin access for most ways to identify the ports or be able to download further software requiring admin access. 
 I also use meraki if this has any way of identifying the ports for end devices too. 
 Thanks in advance

They don't want to pay to do it properly then do it up to their expectations. Use their systems to teach yourself. Stand up virtual environments and figure out how to do it correctly. Then just move on. You aren't critical. They will lay you off and never even think about you a second time. You are just a person that their Auditors tell them have to exist for insurance
 I just got off the phone with my buddy who's been at the same company for 6 years. He's been the sys admin the entire time and the company has no intention of doing a hardware refresh. He was telling me all this hacky shit he has to do in order to make their systems work. I told him to stop he's just shifting the liability from the managers to himself and he's not paid to have that liability
 Also stop putting in heroic efforts in general. If you're doing 100 hours of work weekly then management has no idea they are understaffed. Let things fail do what you can do in 40 and go home. Don't have to be a Superman

 So I replied "bullshit! Are you seriously trying to do business with us by starting off with a lie?" just silence and then 20 seconds later ... click.
 And right now, I'm more mad at myself for not thinking to milk more info from this guy and whatever scam they're trying to pull 🤬🤬🤬
 It's too early in the morning here to deal with their crap.... the first time they did this to me was around 5 am, sometime last week, so naturally I answered it thinking my boss had a super early meeting and needed help with something 🤬

 We use a basic M365 license for our email and have always gotten the occasional phishing attempt. Fortunately, everyone here is good about spotting those so we have not had any issues in the past.
 In recent days, not only am I noticing an increase in these spam messages, but some are being directly sent (or spoofed) from employee emails confirmed in Exchange message trace, and one that just came through included the subject of another legitimate email in the garbage text in the title.
 This is obviously concerning to me but I don't really know where to go for support. Does anyone have any tips or recommended resources for giving ourselves a basic security audit and making sure all of our SPF/DKIM/DMARC stuff is in order? I've been having people change their passwords as well just in case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been dealing an issue where the network performance for users has been extremely poor (1-1.5 Mbps) download speed on 1G ISP uplink.
 Here is the traffic flow underly and overly. 
 Underlay:--- 
 User-----(wireless)------>AP----->L2switch----->WLC----L2switch----->L3 Gw/PANW FW ------->SD-wAN--------->Interent. 
 Overlay:--- 
 User -------(ipsec)--------->L3 Gw/PANW ------->SD-wAN--------->Interent.
 The user overlay does connect PAN-OS firewall via GP client . PAN_OS firewall has VPN gateway configured. I am testing same file download without VPN (GP disable)- The download speed is ~400Mbps which is good but the moment I turn on the VPN (GP on) the speed reduced to hardly ~1-1.5Mbps.
 -To eliminate GP (VPN) issue, I tried the same thing on Wired infra, in both scenarios, with VPN off speed is close to ~400Mbps however with VPN on the speed is ~250Mbps which is good as well considering the overhead of ipsec encryption/deception.
 I am also in hard situation where i am unable to narrow down the issue, if i say wireless is problem then without VPN speed is good, so wireless is fine at the same time if I do VPN testing on Wired infra, VPN gives me expected throughput so I am going into loops where could the problem relies.
 So far I have seen it is combination of Wireless + VPN.
 I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue or would have any suggestions. 
 -When the AP is connected to the local network it contacts the controller as expected, picks up the desired config and broadcasts the SSIDs. The issue is that any client connect to the SSID(s) experience awful bandwidth speeds (e.g. 1-1.5Mbps d/l).
 I have verified end to end MTU on interface it is 1500 and for VPN traffic I have setup mss is 1372.
 Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

 I am about to build a new network and was thinking about building in some redundancy into it. It is a small business network of about 30 devices. 
 I wanted to ask the community if it’s common practice to have multiple firewalls and switches on site just incase one goes down. This is a network for a supermarket and credit card transactions are important source of revenue. I know this may be a dumb question but I want to try to do this the best and most cost efficient way as possible. Thanks for your input ahead of time.

 We are experiencing strange behavior with one of your guests clients. We use a 5520 as foreign controller and a 5508 as guest anchor. The guest uses a vpn in our guest Wi-Fi and he complains over his user experience( e.g. bad video calls) In the DNA Center I see a lot of L3 inter wlan roaming messages alongside deletes and switches from 2,4 to 5 GHz
 So my question is why there are inter wlan roaming messages. I though L3 inter wlan roaming is when a client moves between two aps which are associated to different WLCs? But in my case every ap is associated to the foreign controller. The guest anchor just terminates the guest traffic.

 My MPS company after its revenue wasnt going so well and we dint had any new clients or projects decided to do some mass lay offs.
 They baptized them "temporary lay offs" where its supposed that we are still in the company but we arent paid till a new client or projects comes but it feels more like a lame way to get us laid off without paying back holidays or any compensation package. They ask us to return our equipment like laptop etc and also the ID office card which it doesnt make sense if its supposed to be a temporary lay off. Not to mention that they have closed our email accounts etc.
 So my question is how to handle this? Is there a way that we can still push back for compensation packages or something?
 I guess since they wont pay us anymore the only leverage that we have is not return the equipment and make a scene asking either for a proper lay off with compensation package and paid the untaken holidays or well a real temporary lay off where we keep the equipment till a new client comes?

 We are having issues with Ciena switches and SFPs where the port simply stops working, yet starts working again when we remove and reseat the SFP. Is there a command buried somewhere in SAOS that would allow us to reset or power down the just the one SFP?
 I believe Juniper has a method: "set cmqfx xcvr remove ..." and "set cmqfx xcvr insert ...".
 Thanks all.

 I'm probably going to be too vague in this question, but I'm not sure how to word it. Please ask clarifying questions that may help me :)
 Currently we have a number of VLANs on an HP Procurve switch (router) and it does most of our routing, with a firewall at the edge. There's no sort of Access control -- all the vlans can talk to the other vlans. All the routes for these VLANs are learned routes.
 What the company wants now is to have all traffic run through the firewall so we can more granularly control who accesses what on what port (a nightmare to me, but it is what it is)
 Is there any scenario where I can really test this, or am I looking at a rip and replace of my routing config all in one go? Can I set some sort of routing where I specify a source and next hop? Any way to specify my gateway as the firewall and have it "bypass" the routing on the switch (poorly worded question)?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks! 
 We are currently running into a rather odd experience inside our Office Network.
 When trying to authenticate to any Microsoft Service, the "Log into your Account" Window just crashes without any error or warning. Since we are forced to use per User-Licenses in our organisation, more and more people loose access to the M365-Dekstop Suite. Other Services that require Microsoft authentication like Teams, Edge Login etc. are unusable as well (besides using the Webbrowser equivalents). 
 This issue seems to be userbased, as I do have instances where it works on the same machine with a different user. It can only be solved by deleting the user profile and creating a fresh one.
 With the help of the "Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant" im able to reproduce this by choosing the "Office & Office Apps" -> "I am unable to sign-in to activate or use Office apps." function.
 Sysinternals "TCPview" tool shows, that all network connections needed for authentication are successfully created.
 Procmon does show a lot of actions during the capture, but I wasn't able to gather any useful information from it yet.
 Any ideas on how to further troubleshoot this?
 Im happy for any input.

 Seeking quick sanity check. We have an ActionPack subscription and typically offers internal use licensing for all the latest apps. We have a need for SQL 2022 and it's not in the ActionPack? Anyone know if this is accurate?
 I see several other 2022 versions of software, Win11, etc. so all the latest apps and OS's seem to be in there minus SQL 2022... they do have SQL 2019 but need 2022. Just seems odd SQL 2022 would not be in there...

Is there any tools or programs I could use to discover the devices and setup of the network? There is also physical ethernet cables that seem to go random places no one knows about. Its also strange there are also 3 different wifi networks, have no idea what each one is for.

We'll be ditching Burconix soon as it isn't very good and is only useful for 1st Line issues. 
 However, Burconix comes with its own password change dialog box that is mainly used by teachers to reset student passwords when they've forgotten them and it's pretty useful as we're a big school (2k students) and having teachers raise a ticket for every password reset would clog up our ticket queue and potentially slow down lessons.
 I don't want to start giving teachers access to AD for obvious reasons so if anyone is able to give me an idea of how create dialogue box of my own or point me towards site/forum that has explanation that would be great.
 Thanks in advance.

 I made an oopsie setting up a domain on MS365, a while back and have only gone around to fix it
 When setting up the domain I accidentally put in a capital letter in the domain.
 This wasn't too much of an issue as I then just changed Set-MsolUserPrincipalName to the lowercase version through PS in AD and also changed the SMTP value to all lowercase so when emails are sent out, they are in lowercase.
 It is only in Outlook their mailbox name has firstname.lastname@Mycompany.com
 However, management would like the capital letter to be removed.
 I did explain that when emails are sent out the capital is removed and in the global address book the emails are in lowercase.
 Searching through AD, MS365 Admin and Exchange admin, the only thing that still has the capitals is the domain name in MS365 Admin and User ID in the "Edit Contact Information" section in exchange admin. I assume the User ID in exchange is what's naming the mailbox names in outlook.
 I have since removed the domain and readded the domain in with no capitals, but the users still have the capitals on their mailbox name in outlook and User ID in exchange online.
 Is there any way to change this field in AD users?

 Since Covid, I was highly motivated to change careers to IT and Eventually Cyber-Security. I got 3 certs from CompTIA, Net+. Sec+ and CySA+.
 I thought, that CySA+ would open doors for me by means of landing me an entry level CS job, a mid-level IT job, or at the very least doubling my call back percentage. It has not.
 The next thing that I assumed was holding me back is my lack of degree in IT. I do have a bachelors in another field, Still I signed up for tuiton reimbursement and am working on an AS in IT. In doing so, I then completed A+ and Linux+. However, with family and work obligations, I wont be able to complete my associates for another 2 years, at least. 
 I thought that with my current certifications, and now enrollment in a program, that my resume would stand out. I have sent over 50, and have heard nothing back. 
 One problem is that I can =not go below a certain floor. I live in a very, very expensive market. For reference, fast food employees make 13 an hour here. I bring this up because true entry level IT positions here only pay 17, therefore I cannot accept a true entry level position, unless I continue to work at my current job, which has great benefits but a firm < 6 figure ceiling.

User e-mailed me to say he needed to WFH and access his office PC. We've got a shared RDGW which is used by different clients, but this client aren't on it yet as they are mostly office based. I've recently labbed setting up a RDGW at home, so was quite pleased to get this. 
 I set up CAPs & RAPs and AD Security Groups to point at them, added the PC and the user to the correct AD groups and then added him to the remote desktop users local group on his PC (I know I should do this via GP really, but wanted to get it sorted). Tested with an admin account and it worked. Sent the user a shortcut and it doesn't work.
 Spent several hours going crazy, checking and double checking what I'd set up. Relaxed the CAPs and RAPs to test. Compared it to other clients. Wondering what really obvious thing I've missed. At this point he's given me his AD password, so I test without the gateway from my PC using VPN. It works, but it's not a solution for him as he doesn't have the VPN. Out of desperation I entered his username in pre windows 2000 format and it connected straight away.
 What an earth was going on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a case of a user that clicked a malicious link (fake one drive crap) and they entered their username and password and did 2fa - therefore creating a valid token. 
 We were alerted to the succssfull login attempt and then I proceeded to change the account password, revoked all sessions (from the overview page), revoked all mfa sessions (from the authentication methods page). All looked good for a few days - no malicious logins.
 Then all of a sudden, days later, we see a successful attempt again (blocked for other reasons), but successful with first password and then mfa. They still seem to have a token.
 The user did this on their home personal machine - I am wondering if the TA still has access to that laptop and they grabbed a new token when access was restored for the user last week? I can't see any way they still have a valid token.....
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, just in the stages of planning new network and during our engagement with various vendors we looked at Aruba and it was mentioned that many users with controller setup now deploy large subnets for wireless clients and it is all ok as long as you control BUM traffic. I believe I saw the Aruba reference design say /16s are fine. I understand this is possible as with a controller you can control the BUM traffic as it ingresses.
 This has me wondering, is there any reason this isn't possible on wired network where you have the ability to apply centralised policy at a switch port level on ingress traffic? I know with Aruba it is technically possible to emulate the wireless setup with wired traffic by tunnelling wired traffic to controllers although we couldn't find any examples of customers doing this. Is it not possible on a traditional wired network where you have a NAC and centralised policy that can be applied at port level to discard BUM traffic there? Or is there something else preventing a move towards larger subnet sizing on wired?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Apologies if this seems ultra basic, but I am looking at testing some features on a router I have - Specifically DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) - What I would like to do is the following:
 Device A - Iperf Server
 Router with DPI running
 Device B - Iperf Client
 What I would like to do is effectively smash the link between Device A and B with as much traffic as I can to test the performance of the router with and without DPI running and compare the two. 
 As stated, the devices will be connected to the appliance locally and within the same subnet - There is an argument of course to testing the forwarding performance and the routing performance, but I'd like to cover the basics first, as far as I can tell, the difference would be simply changing the subnet for 1 device.
 Ideally, once I've set this up, I would like to have it automated such that it runs in the early morning (1-2am) and, something that would be really awesome, compile the results and send it as an attachment to an email.
 Is what I'm hoping to do feasible? Has anyone achieved this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building EVPN-VXLAN fabrics typically the underlay is used for reachability of loopbacks for VTEPs and BGP peerings. I'm interested if others have experience of or opinions about connecting a subset of servers directly to the underlay, for a kind of hybrid IP + EVPN-VXLAN fabric.
 The use case is where there are a mix of servers which require pure L3, L2VPN and L3VPN connectivity which are connected to a single leaf/spine network. There could be different design options to cater for that, ranging from co-locating those servers on the same leafs, splitting them onto separate leafs with common spines, or splitting them into separate pods.
 The benefit would be having one network fabric servicing all flavours of server, the possibility for incremental upgrades (e.g "upgrading/downgrading" a port from L3 -> VXLAN without having to re-cable it to a new network). 
 Are there downsides to this hybrid approach? Maybe scalability considerations as TCAM has to be optimised for both EVPN-VXLAN and "normal" IP routing? Convergence issues due to bloat in the underlay routing table?

 My question is : I have followed 802.1x User&Comp Certificate creating like below. Am I Correct ?
 USER CERT :
 Start by duplicating the existing default “User” certificate inside of the “Certificate Templates” management console. 
 Request Handling Tab: 
 Optional – Uncheck “Allow private key to be exported” (best practice)
 Security Tab: 
 Required – Select “Domain User” group and check the “Autoenroll” box
 - Subject Name Tab: 
 Optional – Select “Subject name format” of “Common Name” for easier readability. This field won’t be used to obtain the username, we’ll use the UPN from the SAN (which is a default setting on the template).
 COMPUTER CERT:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I'm planning a switch from a current setup of Fortigate SSL VPN + Azure NPS extension for MFA to Azure SSO via SAML. Done the testing, all good, but I have 2 issues. First, I have to somehow "sell" this switch to the client (as in why this is better than the current setup) and what I'm thinking is 1. benefits of conditional access, 2. logs in only one place and 3. availability, if the radius server somehow goes offline it's bye bye ssl vpn for the users right now. Are there any other advantages that I could mention? 
 Secondly, I have to find a way to do this as "silent" as I can so the users are not...bothered. I know I could do a step by step tutorial and let them modify the existing connection profile but this is not an option. Manually doing it myself remotely is also not an option, there are almost 400 users. What I tought about so far was Intune, but this would work only if I push the full Forticlient app, so it would be a reinstall/upgrade, it needs reboot and so on. Also, I thought about just pushing the configuration via gpo, but I have no idea if the Forticlient connection settings are stored in the registry, or in some file. Any better ideas here?
 Thank you! :)

 CVE-2023-20593
 TomsHardware:
  
Tavis Ormandy, a researcher with Google Information Security, posted today about a new vulnerability he independently found in AMD's Zen 2processors. The 'Zenbleed' vulnerability spans the entire Zen 2 product stack, including AMD's EPYC data center (EPYC 7002) processors and the Ryzen 3000/4000/5000 CPUs, allowing the theft of protected information from the CPU, such as encryption keys and user logins. The attack does not require physical access to the computer or server and can even be executed via javascript on a webpage.
 AMD has patches ready for its EPYC 7002 'Rome' processors now, but it will not patch its consumer Zen 2 Ryzen 3000, 4000, and some 5000-series chips until November and December of this year. 
  
AMD:
  
Any performance impact will vary depending on workload and system configuration. AMD is not aware of any known exploit of the described vulnerability outside the research environment.

I'm getting too burnt out from it and it's one reason I left a job before. I specifically took my current position because it wasn't required but that quickly changed several months ago.'
  
 I've been in IT about 7 years now. Been sys admin the past couple years and recently starting learning more with networking. I'm no expert in one thing, been more a jack of all trades kind of guy. Mostly on-prem but some azure and o365.
  
 The big problem is I'm currently making $90k in a MCOL area so I'm probably going to have to find a 100% remote job which would be new to me. Just looking for what job titles I should be searching for. Even open to suggestions to get out of IT if my skills would easily transfer somewhere else.
  
 Appreciate any advice, really been struggling mentally the past couple weeks and I just need to make a change.

Let's say you are selling or buying a used hard drive and even if you wipe it there's recoverable data; pictures, documents, bitcoin even, etc. By buying the hard drive did the buyer also buy ownership of the data contained on the drive? Or did the buyer only buy the rights to the physical media and the seller retains ownership of the files still remaining on it?

 ​
 I tried doing the basic searches to what a bypass module is, even looking for this particular model, I could not find anything at all pointing in what this is and its purpose. 200G-400G bypass, does it act as an internal loop? For what purpose would you need that?

 Should I accept the offer and quit if I receive another one I want more? Or should I not accept this offer and see what happens with some of the other positions?
 I'm leaning more towards accepting the offer and quitting if I receive a higher paying offer. But I'm looking for advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, not my area of expertise, so thanks for any help.
 I implement web-based automation systems, basically server software that runs on a Windows based computer, and users access the interface via a webpage. They're typically setup on a customer's network and they handle all the remote access, but I frequently start systems before their network is in place and having remote access is a great time saver.
 I have been using Cradlepoint with their Netcloud Perimeter VPN which was perfect. Now that they've deprecated that option, I'm losing my simple to use system. So, I figured I'd setup a port forward like I've done before with systems that use something like spectrum business class ISP. Now after some research into why it didn't work, I'm finding that the cell service I have isn't using publicly routed IPs.
 I've tried the IOT Advanced subscription option from Cradlepoint, but it's painfully slow and not at all easy to use. Do I have any options to get some sort of inexpensive VPN option similar to what was included with the Cradlepoint Netcloud subscription? Thanks again for any help, or suggestions on a better place to ask this question.

For example, if I have a device (2.41.10.10,255.255.0.0) on VLAN 41 (2.41.0.1) that allowed me to monitor it by accessing a web browser, and I wanted to be able to access that web browser from a device (2.11.1.x) on VLAN 11 (2.11.0.1)? How does this change if one device is on VLAN 11 (2.11.0.1) on switch A and the device hosting the web browser is in VLAN 41 (2.41.0.2) on switch B, with a trunk between the two? Both switches are running Cisco OS. I’ve tried messing with static routes a bit, but have had little luck and I’m struggling to understand the routing required, but I’m sure it’ll click with a bit of help. TIA! Definitely have a slew of other questions about routing and best practices, but we’ll get there step by step!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of Friday, July 21, 2023 11:05:56 AM, Dell was notified about a outage with a 4-hour mission critical support contract. Dell has repeatedly failed to communicate and has dropped the ball on providing their end of a support plan purchased with a server not even a month old.
 We are not even getting replies from dell. It has been over 72 hours now... We have called, emailed, and are now replacing this brand new server because we have zero confidence this will be resolved timely.
 Anyone have any suggestions? 
 Update: 7-24-23 -8pm cst
 Dell made us aware late Monday (today) that the part is not available in any warehouse in the US. We had to call and email everyone at Dell to get them to tell us this. 
 We were told they would get back to us with alternative options, different better card, whole new server, something... "soon." We have not heard back yet today. Tomorrow may be more promising and redeeming of them.
 It is a Perc raid card running an array of SSDs that they cant source. As a brand new server of the latest generation, I can only assume its because its so "new" they dont have extras on hand... the worse scenario, is that the cards are failing so fast, they dont have any to fill our warranty request :O

How in the world can Microsoft let a threat actor get their hands on MSA keys to "forge tokens and access OWA and Outlook on line" Are you fucking kidding me? And what's worse, we're just supposed to brush it off like it's no big deal? It's been almost two weeks, and there are still no new updates to the KB on this issue.
 To top it off, there's this wiz blog claiming they could have gained full access to Azure and O365! I'm beyond frustrated that Microsoft hasn't made any public statement about this; You can't make one public statement saying that they didn't have access? If you open sourced any of this, we would be able to tell ourselves.... But because understanding the Azure AD token cycle is just a piece of cake for everyone on this planet, except for me and the rest of the fucking IT people in the world who don't have 6 months to go thru Azure token training, I have to sit here and fucking guess.
 I mean, who needs straightforward explanations when you can have a delightful puzzle-solving experience trying to figure out their convoluted jargon and mind-bending concepts.
 Good luck trying to google Storm-0558, You will get 800 AI news stories on it. This one is painful.

In that time, 38% of all our support tickets have taken 10 or more days to resolve, 15% took more than 50 days - regardless of their priority.
 If you buy their products and you need support you are essentially left staring at a large cancelled check with big regrets.
 AVOID.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Am I wrong here?
 When someone, usually non-IT, is pushing for some wireless gizmo, I take the stance of 'always wired, unless there is absolutely no other choice' Because obviously, difficult to troubleshoot/isolate, cable is so much more reliable, see history, etc
 Exceptions are: remote users, internal workers whose work takes them all over the campus. I have pushed back hard against cameras, fixed-in-place Internet of Thingies, intercoms
 When I make an exception, I usually try to build in a statement/policy that includes 'no calls during non-business hours' if it goes down.
 I work in an isolated environment and don't keep up with IT trends much, so I like to sanity check once in awhile, am I being unreasonable? Are you all excepting of wireless hen there is a wired option? It seems like lots of times the implementer just wants it because it is more 'cool'.
 It is just really tiresome because these implementers and vendors are like "Well MOST of our customers like wireless..." I am getting old, and tired of fighting..

 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/157ofsf/managers_directors_would_you_fire_me_over_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1
 There were a couple of asshats, but only like two. Anyway, I couldn’t really sleep last night and I spoke to my boss this morning. 
 First thing he said was that he thought it was going to be worse, lol. He also said that when I’m gone for a week, he forgets to check Mimecast or when I’m not in on Fridays, and that it’s not completely my fault as he never even warned me about the 48 hour thing when he showed me the system. Anyway, I think part of it was probs trying to make me feel better but I took full accountability for it, as I said that I would. He said it isn’t a massive issue, and we just talked about how I was going to sort it going forward.
 I spoke to the SS, and she was like “Righttttt…” but basically said that she’s not going to feather and tar me and thanked me when I said that I had sorted it going forward. I did apologise as I am responsible for Mimecast.
 Anyway, I still have a job and the held queue is clear.
 Thank you all for commenting. At this stage, I’m not comfortable with allowing users to release their own emails as I don’t trust that they won’t end up being stupid about it, but I will look at potentially revising the current process in place.
 I still feel a bit icky about it all, but at the end of the day, I didn’t know about it before as it hadn’t been raised. The sales supervisor said that at least now we know and it’s good that we know, which I agreed with, as it means that we can stop this going forward.
 One day, when I’m older than 22, and maybe when I’m a manager myself, I will remember this and tell my juniors about it, lol.
 This is by far my biggest fuckup in 3 years, but I think I’m going to be okay… fingers crossed!

 In the past Id run into, "Okay, please try again." And they'll say, "I already have." And I say, "Right, please test now..."
 So I have developed saying something like the following but a bit nicer to save time and set a baseline all in one.
  
Fixed at 13:45. Any attempt before 13:45 will have not worked. If you haven't tested after 13:45, please do so."
  
This gives me a baseline and always sets a timestamp of when it was fixed.
 Another thing -
 We're all adults. I shouldn't have to tell you, "Okay. It's Friday morning. If you dont get this to me by a reasonable time to look at, that customer may have to wait all weekend for a fix." That's on you to work the logistics out. Even if I feel bad for customer. If I get in the middle, I'm stuck in the middle. And I don't have time to do two jobs.
 There is this woman over support who doesn't do the base work. Friday I asked her how to replicate. She says we'll have to replicate the customer env in the testing env." And time stood still and I stared at my screen thinking, "Why didn't you do that before escalating to me? You mean you haven't tried to replicate the issue?"
 So I push back and tell her to let me know know when she has copied their setup to our testing env. She waited until Saturday to do it. Then first thing Monday morning asks, "Were you able to determine the issue with .." 
 I've been online an hour, Susan. It's Monday. You didn't give me what I needed until Saturday.
 I need tea.

 For media-data transport we have a network of multiple Netgear M4300 Switches. It has no access to the internet and I don’t care about security for my use case too much. Is it possible to access all the vlans from one single administration pc without having a separate connection to each one? Can you point me in a direction what I have to search for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm troubleshooting a point to point link connecting two data centers. It's 10gig, but deployed by a provider who packetizes, so it does not behave like a traditional 10gig wave / private line which just repeats light. This means you can usually get up to several gigabits on a single TCP stream, but need more streams to fully utilize the circuit. There's about 50ms of latency between locations due to geography. 
 The issue we're having is TCP performance is mostly horrible, but sometimes goes back to near normal. Using iperf, if I test between two nodes on the same layer two vlan that's bridged across this link, sometimes I'll see possibly close to 2 gbps, as low as 100 Mbit/sec, but typically averaging out in the sub-600 Mbit/sec range. Watching the linux tcp counters, I can see numerous retransmits, timeouts, backoffs, etc. So, clearly the circuit is dropping packets. 
 If I switch to UDP and vary the send rate, 1Gbps or lower gets me 0.068% packet loss, 2Gbps 0.3%, 2.5Gbps 0.89%, 3 Gbps and we're into the 1.1%+ range with spikes as high as 6%. 
 The end to end setup had been working fine for half a year and then on a specific day began this behavior.
 Has anyone ever seen a transceiver issue cause behavior like this? My experience has been those will have light issues and/or affect all traffic types. Light is strong in both directions. They also tend to go from working to failing, not something in between. In contrast, I've routinely seen this kind of issue affect circuits when there is an overloaded node in the path, an incorrectly configured QoS or rate limit config somewhere, etc. The transit provider assures me none of that is in place nor any overloaded or failing links in the path.

Here is the text of the last reach out. The other one was a company called CapVision. I think this is a scheme to get in touch with the people making purchase decisions so I can get even more fucking sales calls. Anyone know if these are legit?

I am wondering if there is any kind of service or partnership known in IT that helps go through a company's support model and help with workflow, budgets, staffing, and basic day to day operations to find areas where we can improve.
 Our current IT department I feel is not utilized well, everyone wears multiple hats, everyone is on live phones, many processes don't have good documentation, or ticketing system and asset tracking is a mess, and I feel like we are spending way too much on services and tools we don't need. I am wondering about finding and suggesting an outside consulting company to our leadership that can take an unbiased look at how we are operating and our workflow and suggest how we can restructure to improve.
 It is very stressful at my job a lot of times because we don't have good structure in place, I feel every day I am just showing up and opening a mixed bag of whatever is a priority for that day and never having time to schedule or work on projects, aside from small pockets of time here and there to spend 30 minutes or so on something randomly during a week. It's a mess. But as much as I try to improve and document and organize what I am working on randomly over time, the department as a whole is pretty scrambled. If we had an expert consultant come on site and give some recommendations, I think it would be a good way to put us on track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I manage a large network with many sites.
 A rough estimate would be about 40-50 switches (most of them 48 port witb 4x fiber ports) in total - maybe more.
 And at the moment some of them are ancient HP/Aruba switches, some are a bit younger.
 All without SDN, for each port I have to go to this horrible interface of the respective switch.
 In addition, there are physically separate LAN and VoIP (so no Vlans).
 I want to kick all of this out.
 Which manufacturer would you recommend me?
 I already know ubiquiti with OnPremise Controller, that I found actually quite good, but no idea whether the manufacturer is suitable for such an enterprise network. 
 As a criterion:
 SDN - preferably with low running costs! Rather OnPrem controller than cloud.
 Fast configuration, understandable QoS settings for the future Vlan separation between Lan and VoIP.
 The hardware should not be as expensive as gold, yet offer a certain degree of durability. (Like not be eol after 2 years)
 Any suggestions?

 This is a quick diagram I did to hopefully show things better, the network is a true HA setup and will be air gapped. Each rack will contain 2 switches as the workstations have dual nics, like I mentioned there is not much info in regards to the configuration as I am just trying to make sure I am understanding the concept correctly before a network engineer starts designing further.

 Any guidance would be very helpful :) thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow network enthusiasts,
 I'm currently working on setting up a network with redundant ISP links and MikroTik devices for a business set-up, and I could use some expert advice to optimize the configuration. Here's the setup I have in place:
 ISP Redundancy Links: Two ISP links connected to a D-Link switch DGS 1210. Redundancy is vital for uninterrupted connectivity.
 Captive Portal: A MikroTik rb 3011 router configured with a captive portal to manage user authentication and access control.
 Distribution over Fiber SFP: A MikroTik CRS106 1c 5s used for distributing the network over fiber using SFP modules.
 L3 PoE Switch: A Layer 3 PoE switch TL-SG 2210P, which enables efficient power delivery to connected devices.
 Access Point: The network extends to an EAP245 Access Point, providing wireless connectivity.
 If you have experience working with similar setups or expertise with MikroTik devices, your insights and suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I'm open to any ideas that can help me optimize this network setup and make it as efficient as possible.
 Thank you in advance for your valuable assistance!

 I have a powerbi gateway server running, but when creating a data source, what account is best to use for the connection?
 Ideally not a user, as when they change their password the connection will fail for everyone.
 I'm not a fan of generic accounts, but should I create one for this connection, it only needs read access to SQL.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting on a new account, just looking to get everyones thoughts on this. Tried to post ITCareer subreddit, isn't as active over there.
 Currently Senior IT Systems Manager in a company based in England with 4 regional offices and 20+ branches. Team of 5 including myself.
 1 IT Director
 2 Sys Admin
 1 Trainee Sys Admin
 I currently deal with everything IT related; ERP, CRM, Department Software(HR etc), Network, Infrastructure, Procurement, Asset Management, Support, Setting up Branch's, Mobile/Tablets, 365, SQL/Databases, backup, HyperV, Storage and Programming/Design/Development.
 Basically every IT role you can imagine into one, that is the way IT has always been here.
 I have been here for around 6 years, the 2 Sys Admins 15+ years each and the IT Director 25+ Years. I have been given the opportunity in the next 24 months to takeover the roll of IT Director/Manager with also a chance to have ownership in the company.
 The 2 Sys Admins are very much stuck in their ways reluctant to new tech, struggle to keep up with demand, and very laid back. I am very much holding the IT function together as even the Director has little to no interest as he is retiring.
 I have brought up at our annual reviews the lack of interest and enthusiasm from the Sys Admins I get told they are "getting on" so will struggle and I just need to accept that they will try what they can to make sure they are keeping with the times but that's down to the individuals. I feel like they are just letting them ride it out, and hopefully they will retire in the next 5 years or so.
 These Sys Admins are on £3-4k less than me per year.
 Do I hold out and take the opportunity while still having to do all the tasks/functions above or just start looking for a new position over the next few months?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I think this will be a question for the Wireless guys. Do any of you know of an Android/Apple App that will monitor the Wireless Latency and Packet Loss (1sec interval preferred) of your network? Something that will allow me to ICMP Latency and Packet Loss monitor an IP address wired into the LAN to measure the WLAN Latency/Packet Loss at a site. Ideally this app will also log the AP MAC/SSID/Name that the client is connected to and you will be able to go hey I see our clients are getting a lot of packet loss near Access Point 1 for example. The dream state will allow me to upload a map of the site to the app and then do BLE/Wifi locationing to know exactly where clients are having packet loss issues on the WLAN (I know this is a dream state that probably doesn't exist yet).
 If none of you know of anything paid/free then I guess I will have to build something myself which I really don't want to have to do... I know an Ekahau has Latency/Packet Loss monitoring, but I am after an app we can put on clients and monitor all the time.

 Studying their configuration menu they seem to spit out MQTT with frames but they lack of documentation if they add all the payload of what they receive.

 There is a .net framework uninstall tool in a GitHub repo linked from MS, but when I run it, it doesn’t see any versions it can remove.
 In server admin, I can remove 3.5 and 4.5, but there are a ton of other versions listed.
 Anyway, does anyone have any advice for cleaning up old versions of .net framework? At this point I’d even try getting rid of ALL versions and reinstalling the ones I need.
 Or, does anyone know how to uninstall a single version? If I can figure that out I can script the removal of them all.

 We currently do have EDR on said servers. Which are both internal and external facing.

 Has anyone implemented password less in their organisation or supported organisations? 
 If so how has it affected tickets, workflows etc. How has it changed the users opinions on a different way of logging in? Were there any parts to the implementation or rollout you weren't expecting? Would you do it again elsewhere? 
 I'm doing some minor research at the moment on password less authentication and interested to see how it stacks up in the minds of the the admins who have adopted it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! Part-time sysadmin for my own small business here. We're retiring our office over the next few months and we have a chunk (about 12TB) of data on a NAS in our rack here that we need to migrate to our Google Drive shares. We have plenty of storage capacity available in Drive and a solid 500Mbit uplink that's totally unused so no concerns around transfer times or capacity.
 ​
 So far the best option I've found to handle the transfer is this:https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/9222862
 The requirements are quite daunting - we don't really have much hardware in this office (it's primarily used for video content production) outside of the NAS, and Workspace Migrate requires 3 relatively beefy Windows Servers. 
 Obviously there's the option of just uploading in chunks each day until we hit the upload quota for the accounts we're using - but ideally I'd like to use something a bit more elegant. Does anyone know of any services, scripts, open-source projects etc. that might be helpful here? I've already reached out to a few that I've found (CloudFuze and a couple of others) but would appreicate if anyone has any other suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am looking for some suggestions on how do we better provision servers in our environment. I'll try to explain it as detailed as possible. 
 For example, every admin in our environment creates a server differently in the sense that they dont see the correct settings etc, dont disable weak security encryption etc, its all build in a mess. I don't want to just create a document, but maybe use a tool which has maybe a VM template and can automate all of this. Will something like SCVMM do the job? Or is there something else? 
 SCVMM came to mind because then it also comes with Orchestrator, which we can build to automate the user provisioning etc but again, this is just because i don't know other options.
 The more automation the better, of course not everything can be done in that way. Also we use Azure as well as hyper-v and Vmware.

 The data migration process typically involves the following steps:
 Assessment: Understand the structure and volume of the data you want to migrate. Identify any potential data dependencies, data formats, and specific requirements for the target cloud platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I have a strange case at a company where they use a Mitel MiVoice Business (Release level: 8.0 SP3 PR2) and each time User A (Alexa) calls User B (Bruno) it shows the right name. But in the Missed, Outgoing and Received Calls lists it always shows the name of a former user C (Chris).
 The way we put the extension in place was we removed the old extension entry to set it up from scratch. Factory formated the phone (Mitel 5312) and now it still shows in those histories with the wrong name.
 There even is the same issue with just a contact of a phone directory entry. We give some people a company mobile phone and one of those phones changed hands to a new person (Jane Goodall). So when that person calls it always displays the name of the former user (Sandra Bullock). The only place I know where to look for is under "Users and Devices" > "Telephone Directory Management" > "Telephone Directory".
 There is no more entry even remotely having the former user's name and it somehow still stays in the system. Does anyone have an idea on this?
 Edit:
 No personal entries were created on any of the affected phones

 I would prefer not using a new application
 We are using Intune to update but it doesn't seems to check the availability of new version on editor website
 Is there any website which centralize the new version of each software? something similar to https://cve.mitre.org/ but for all new software version and not only security patch? 
 It would be better if I can import/link to intune to get the list of installed software but I could work without it

We have several protected computers VM and physical machines and everything works great. I have been tasked to setup a new server with windows server 2019 standard and add the server to the DPM. Whenever i try to install the protection agent through the DPM Administrator console this error comes up. 
 Error 402: When trying to retrieve information from the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service on testSERVER.example.local, access was denied. 
 I'm using Domain Admin credentials btw.The second thing i tried was installing the agent manually via cmd as administrator. This was a success and it also added some firewall exceptions. Having installed the agent manually i tried attaching it but i had the same exact error 402. 
 Now i tried installing the agent manually on a windows 10 pro machine and as soon as i installed the agent manually the computer popped up on the management section no problem. I'm thinking there may be some compatibility problem with the version of DPM. If anyone can help me it will be much appreciated as I’m at a loss.

 Our deployments are fully unattended, but when it comes to setting up the laptop with the dock and monitors, the monitor order is wrong every so often, and the primary monitor needs to be set.
 Is it possible to do this without logging into Windows? Is there a smart shortcut from the login screen that I'm unaware of? I know of Windows + P to set it to extend the monitors instead of duplicating.
 I could log in with my own account or administrator account to do so, but then I have to wait for the login, have my user profile created on the users laptop, and then finally it also would show it as the default user on the laptop, when the employee wants to log in for the first time.
 How do you deal with it?

I'm looking to see if there are any tools out there that might take a single TCP flow between two hosts and split it up into several flows over an ECMP WAN and then recombine at the other end (induced latency is OK for this requirement.) I have many 1Gb/s paths between two points but I have some elephant flows that are stuck on a single path for a long time. I'm struggling with my google-fu figuring out what to search for, I'd guess its going to be pretty niche if it exists at all. I'm looking to to treat traffic after it leaves the source as the source is an appliance I can't modify. I can't replace the 1Gb/s paths with faster paths unfortunately.

 EDIT: I'm not sure, that i had enabled the option "redirect the folder back", before i enabled FolderRedirect.

The experience is that after you press <Enter> in v3, nothing happens other than the cursor drops to a new line. The only way to terminate the cmdlet is to close the PowerShell session. In v2, you receive the "are you sure" prompt.
 Anyone else experiencing this issue? If not, I'll be suspicious of our conditional access policy for REST clients, but no other cmdlet is affected that we know of.

 I've added the two registry keys on some PC's and confirmed the tenant ID and tenant name are correct - however after doing a dsregcmd /status it still wont join to AAD for hybrid AAD join. I've done multiple restarts etc. 
 Is there any other steps i need for this?

 Managing our service operationally has become a little hectic and we've been slapped on the wrist a few times for missing SLAs recently. Our director end of last week gave us hints about how the current process of 1 on-call engineer having to manage all 80 production deployments is getting a little crazy and that our MTTR (minimum time to response) is way too high... 
 Eventually... he proposed we start automating some stuff such as root cause analysis/canary analysis/early anomaly detection - especially with the new AI buzz, and as a lead engineer asked me to look into it.
 Anyone have experience dealing with this kinda situation? I wonder if there's a way the MTTR can be reduced using processes. Maybe better training with the remaining members of my team? or even like using PagerDuty better? Or any service that helps solve this?
 I'm pretty frustrated atm cuz i already have enough sht to do. I don't think this is gonna solve anything. If we end up working on this I'm going to quit.

This person was the bearer of all secrets basically, so nothing seems to be "typical" and I have had the joy of problem solving all of this the past few months, reverse engineering the pieces of you will. 
 Last week we had an issue with our Juniper SRX340 Firewall at one of the buildings. The power light is green, yet the "STAT" light is solid amber. I am trying to get into the device to troubleshoot. But i am blocked getting to it from the server (obviously) and connecting to the management port does not seem to do anything. The guide on Junipers website shows "figures" for ports our SRX340 does not have. 
 Can someone please tell me how to connect to the SRX340 to check what the error is? My thought is the device isn't fully booting, and that's why I'm unable to manage/access any "normal" way. But thought I would ask in case I'm missing something, regarding how to manage/access the device to check why the "STAT" light is amber! 
 P.S. I let it boot for about 45 minutes and it would randomly (at no obvious intervals, as I was timing the power up) the fan would kick on into high speed, and the "STAT" light would turn green for about 5 seconds, and then back to Amber. Also, if I can find a backup of the device, how would I restore it?

Five years later, I was managing the core services for a 1500-endpoint network in Silicon Valley. I haven't personally experienced the excitement of being at the center of an international data theft incident like Mr. Stoll was, but I've had my share of exciting situations nonetheless. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I am running an Ethernet over GRE tunnel in a test environment and have a couple questions:
 This lab setup has four VyOS routers with MTU set at 1538.
 SRC -> R1 (source of GRE tunnel) -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 (destination of EoGRE tunnel) -> DST
 SRC is physically plugged into R1.
 DST is physically plugged into R4.
 Intermediate links are ethernet or AirFiber AF5XHD (MTU = jumbo frames)
 Reading the config file on the airfibers shows:
 ame.net.jumbo=enabled
 netconf.4.mtu=1538
 netconf.3.mtu=1538
 netconf.2.mtu=1538
 netconf.1.mtu=1538
 I can ping and run traffic normally between SRC and DST.
 However, when I run a traceroute, I still show intermediate hops, which doesn’t make sense, since the GRE tunnel starts at R1 and ends at R4, and should act as a transparent wire, correct?
 When this happened with MTU 1500, I changed all intermediate links to 1538 and routers to 1538 MTU, and rebooted everything. Do I need to change MTU to something even higher? Are the MTU settings what are causing these intermediate hops to show up?
 traceroute to 172.18.2.54 (172.18.2.54), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets
 1 * * *
 2 * * *
 3 172.18.2.54 (172.18.2.54) 12.438 ms 9.779 ms 9.727 ms

 The device we have gets the job done, but there are times for those larger projects it would be nice to have the ability to feed in some data when we have to create 50+ labels rather than type them all manually into the Dymo.

Since then every few days the link freaks out and we have to reboot one of the bridges to stabilize it. We've looked but can't fine the old firmware to downgrade it. Nothing shows up in the logs. Any ideas? Or a link to an older firmware would also be helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s up nerds. I’m currently a tech at a small MSP in Tampa Florida with a goal to move to and work in New York City in the coming months. I’m looking for some advice for securing some sort of sys admin role in that specific job market, as well as any other direction in becoming an admin in general.
 I have a year and a half of experience working on a tier one help desk for a large company, which became tedious and somewhat boring when each interesting ticket I came across had to be escalated to other teams. I then moved to the current MSP to gain some real hands on experience, which I most definitely have, wearing multiple hats every day since we’re such a tiny team. In the additional year and a half here, I believe I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals working with firewalls, servers, O365, Azure etc daily. 
 I have no certifications currently but, working through CCNA and Azure 104 to not only get them under my belt, but to start filling in all the little knowledge holes I may have from jumping in to the deep in and learning to swim as I went along.
 Anyway, I’m mostly looking to hear from folks that work or have worked in the city, especially any quirks related to landing a job, living and working there, or maybe any mistakes you made along your way. I’m just a 3 year old IT baby, but I’m convinced it’s possible to make it happen for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every SaaS provider and their dog want to send/receive emails in 365 via OAuth using application permissions since basic authentication has been deprecated. Whether they are fancy/smart enough to publish their own "Azure App" or they want you to register one in your AAD tenant.
 There are at least 2 ways to access/send emails via:
  
GraphAPI - via Mail.[Some action] application permissions
 Office 365 Exchange Online API - IMAP/SMTP/POP.AccessAsApp (doc here)
  
What freaks me out is giving "Admin consent" to these apps. Does this mean they get to use these permissions on ALL of our users? Its the kind of thing that does not let me sleep at night.
 From RTFMin a bit I've come to the conclusion - please confirm or correct me:
  
if application permission is via GraphAPI - yes, the Mail.* permissions are given to the app on ALL mailboxes in the org. You HAVE to use ApplicationAccessPolicy to limit the app's access (doc here).
 1. if application permission is via 1. Office 365 Exchange Online API - no, there needs to be an explicit Exchange Service Principal and that be assigned mailbox permissions (as implied in the doc here). Tested with the test tool mentioned in this blog (used temporary secret)
  
If I got that correct, now my questions is - are there other APIs that mail? How - as an admin - am I supposed to know and VERIFY the level of permissions granting admin consent will provide this app? Am I missing something in my Azure App/SP understanding and it supposed to be obvious?
 If you there is a better place for such a question than please also do point me there (I see a lot of technical questions downvoted here stating that there are better and more specific subs).

 I have recently resigned and serving my notice period. Due to this I don't get a lot of work or any work for that matter.
 So recently, I have been working on a research paper and downloaded it from my Linkedin account. I worked on it and then when I was sending it back (on Linkedin) a Forcepoint DLP popup came up saying "Confidential Data detected" There was a user override option stating "This is my personal data, and doesn't contain "Company's" confidential information." I selected that, and sent the same.
 Now I am worried that I will be in trouble. Just to be sure, there is no confidential information in the paper, all the information is publically available and is referenced properly. I work in a legal role, so we regularly get such research papers for different laws. 
 What will happen when I have selected the user override option? 
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When putting the whole organisation in scope for Cyber Essentials, then it's my understanding that all cloud services used by the organisation will be in scope.
 Has anyone managed to put the whole organisation in scope when it uses some systems and services which have limited administrative capabilities, such as lacking MFA, SSO, ability to support multiple accounts, etc. From the mock submission we've did for Cyber Essentials, a major non conformity was raised for using systems not supporting MFA. 
 In this regard Cyber Essentials appears more stringent than ISO 27001. There later indicates controls should be appropriate to the level of risk. Therefore MFA may not be a necessity if other controls can be used to mitigate risks. For Cyber Essentials, MFA as a control seems non negotiable, i.e. mandatory.
 For context, here are some examples of systems I'm thinking about: - Finance systems used to manage employee company pensions - Finance systems used to manage corporate investments - Healthcare systems used to manage private healthcare benefits - Cycle to work schemes used to offer employee benefits
 Some of these systems are big household names, used by many many companies. They are sometimes difficult to transition away from meaning they'll be in use for the foreseeable.
 In summary, I'm trying to understand if the use of such systems will cause us any issues when working towards Cyber Essentials.
 Any help and advice would be appreciated 😁

We know it's not per 24 hours because if we delete the migration batch and restart it, it continues another 2 GB. We tried slowing the migration down to 1 account at a time but it still hangs but does not technically fail. It just keeps saying "Syncing..." but the account size isn't getting larger after the initial 2 GB (per batch delete and recreate retry). All accounts under 2 GB synced fine. We've opened a ticket with Rackspace, no response as of yet.
 Does anybody have any ideas? Thank you.

I've been in IT for six years, but my qualifications for my position included a year of previous experience supporting a VDI and raising my hand first when the prior virtualization SME left for greener pastures. I always feel like an imposter who will eventually be discovered as a fraud who bluffed their way into the position. None of this relates to my question, just trying to explain my frame of mind.
 On Friday, I was approached by one of the leads in hushed tones. He said one of the next-level supervisors was departing, and rather than try to fill their spot, their supervisory responsibilities were being split. I was asked if I would like to take a few of those (time-sheet sign-off, minor HR things) for a pay bump. Said to think about it and we'd have a bigger talk next week.
 I know the big stuff: get it in writing on my contract spelling out my responsibilities, but what else should I keep in mind? How can taking on supervisor roles affect IT work? Does anyone regret it?

 I'm 21, based out of the US.
 Ever since I was a boy I loved systems and always knew this was my path, but now I'm not sure where should I focus myself.
 I did Java & Python programming in high school and realised coding isn't really for me, at least not as the main part of my job(I adore batch scripting and powershell though).
 At 16, I started learning about computer hardware via Youtube and became a remote PC consultant, I became quite good at it, consulted for over 100 different systems and built some of them personally, even offering repair services to close friends. I realised this job can't be for the long term because of the pay and left it at that.
 At 18, I worked for a telecommunication company and acquired coax & fiber knowledge alongside basic networking.
 At 19 I became a network administrator and did a bootcamp(although I did more basic helpdesk duties and network technician duties).
 Now I'm 21 and I'm leading that network administrators team(which infact does helpdesk and technician duties), I deal with onboarding/offboarding people from my company and configuring Cisco devices, IT documentation, some virtualization with VMware as well with some other physical network stuff.
 I have a homelab which has a hybrid Active directory environment mixed with azure. 
 I hold comptia a+, Microsoft az-900, az-104 and I'm close to comptia network+.
 The problem:
 From a lot of people, I hear system administration is dying, it's either moving to the cloud or getting automated so demand is decreasing.
 What can my options be? I feel that in this field it's so hard to find a path, as it expands so much
 Become a Sys admin? Focus on cloud administration? DevOps? Microsoft specialist(if that's even a thing)? Should I just quit and do a Bsc in network engineering?
 I would really appreciate if you have any insights for me.
 Thanks for reading.

 I've had a domain with Google domains for a few years now which I've held but not used it just so the name of the domain isn't taken by someone else. 
 However now with the squarespace buyout of google domains, I'm looking to move the domain to cloudfare. One of the things I liked about google domain was the cheap annual cost (£10), especially for something I'm not fully using. Checking cloudfare, I'm being quoted $20 a month for the pro package which is more than I've spend total over the past 2 years with google domains! 
 The options I think I have currently:
  
Take the cloudflare basic package and pay $0 annually. If I decide to finally use the domain to build a website I'm not sure if it will be able to handle traffic?
 
Seek an alternative domain registrar - Not sure who else can offer the same features and cost as I currently get with Google domains?
 
 Any help is appreciated!

 2- What are the recommended authentication methods for each SSID to ensure data security and convenient access for the respective user groups?
 3- In the context of enterprise wireless practice, should we have separate SSIDs for each band (5GHz and 2.4GHz), or is there a more efficient way to manage wireless bands for our specific setup?

 I apologize in advance if this isn’t the right place for this post. I'm currently working as a Tier-2 helpdesk technician for a call center, which primarily comprises a remote workforce. Recently, we have been transitioning some of our users from traditional workstations to Azure CloudPC.
 Prior to this migration, our employees were using Cisco AnyConnect as their VPN solution. However, we were encountering persistent issues with call drops, primarily due to the users' connections. With the Azure CloudPC, we've seen a significant reduction in the number of dropped calls.
 Despite this improvement, we're now experiencing a new problem: there's been a noticeable audio delay reported by the users who've been migrated.
 While searching for solutions, I came across this, which introduces a concept of multimedia redirection: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/multimedia-redirection-intro
 I'm wondering if anyone here has encountered similar issues or can provide insights into whether this multimedia redirection could serve as an effective remedy to our audio delay problem. We use Five9 contact center software. Any advice or experience you could share would be greatly appreciated. I’m just sick of all these tickets coming in. 
 Thank you in advance.

Group policies for removing old profiles
 CC Cleaner on schedule (scan and update)

 Windows updates and reboots on schedule (already configured)

I would also love to configure some sort of monitoring software where I can receive email reports of AV scans and anything else you may suggest. If it helps, I plan on deploying our first Linux machine where I will be installing LibreNMS to monitor the network hardware so feel free to suggest something Linux based. 
 Thank you.
 P.S. I am a novice sysadmin hence the basic question.

 We have a mix of Power Users, Developers and Data Engineers that will end up using VDI. 
 Power users and Data engineers are more compute intensive, such as SSMS, Power BI, TreeSize, etc. 
 Developers tend to use things more like DOT net sdk, vscode, visual studio code, nodejs, some SSMS, etc. 
 I’m looking at 4 CPU, 16 gig ram, but unsure if that’s overkill. 2 CPU & 8 gig ram might ideally suit developers more. Thoughts?

 My assumption is that a network firewall can filter traffic between different subnets, so you cannot put a firewall to filter traffic in same broadcast domain, right?
 I'm saying this becase this article seems to imply that a firewall can filter traffic in the same subnet:
 If your network doesn’t have a guest wifi network and your Iot devices are on the same subnet as all other devices, you could (but it may be cumbersome) assign a static IP to MAC address assignment for the IoT devices so they get a block of IP addresses an assign firewall rules to that block so that it can’t talk to the rest of the network that is on the same broadcast domain (really? I assumed a firewall doesn’t filter within the same subnet), but again, even so, those devices would have access to the mgmt. interface, so you should set up a very strong username and pw.

 Any insight much appreciated.

 I have a customer that purchased a refurb Dell R440 and I went ahead and used a Dell ISO from another clients Digital Locker to install Server 2022 Standard as that is the environment my customer will be using, but yet hasnt obtained licensing yet for.
 When I boot into Server 2022, the OS works but it isn't activated. Is it possible to install or activate the trial from a non activated standard installation?
 I know this sounds backwards (as it is), but I need a functioning server using the 180 day trial otherwise I keep getting D/C'd with networking and stuff while prepping for their migration project. The reason why I used a Dell Digital Locker ISO is to ensure that the drivers and everything during deployment would be included in the install.
 I'm also familiar with actually changing product keys and activating/upgrading using the following documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/upgrade-conversion-options#converting-between-retail-volume-licensed-and-oem-licenses but there is no option to change from a running un-activated Server license to a trial listed.
 Any help would be appreciated. I'd like to avoid having to re-install everything again.
 Thanks in advance.

 I’ve been in IT for 21 years. Desktop mainly, with dips in and out of infrastructure, but always user-facing.
 I got pressured young, like so many of us, to find a ‘proper’ job and after one false start (doing something completely unrelated), it felt like all the ‘adults’ around me cranked up the intensity on said properness, and I had to get work fast. So I took a job selling records and movies and hardware at a big name chain store (which I loved) while searching for a way into IT. Why?…]]></summary>

 Is there any way I can get the contents of the folders back into the user profile? As far as I know, these folders are then empty in the profile, or in the old state.
 Does anyone have an idea what I can do? Or is there only the solution to copy the files and contents manually or with a script?

 EDIT: I'm not sure, that i had enabled the option "redirect the folder back", before i enabled FolderRedirect.
 Is there any way I can see what settings FolderRedirect used to create the folders?

 We currently manage our own terrestrial infrastructure globally and purchase our own capacity across these links for our global clients.
 Like all businesses, there is a push to drive down cost, get better visibility, and be more agile in getting sharp pricing. 
 Current annual spend is 6-10M USD. 
 Currently our network is driven by MPLS and with a wider adoption of SDWAN, has anyone transitioned over to a full SDWAN core?
 There are two motives, one is to reduce cost on the terrestrial. Is it now time to look at other global carriers to offload some of our circuits, or is this likely to have a negative effect on cost when we manage it ourselves. 
 The second, can we achieve better outcomes utilising our own SDWAN core, incorporating internet solutions as backup paths with global ports in different POPs etc. Utilsing a SDWAN core could potentially remove the requirement for a MPLS equipment and utilize SDWAN software (and likely cheaper hardware) for the routing engines, maybe cheaper than utilising a Juniper/Cisco core?
 Has anyone gone down a change in mindset on service delivery?

 My current title is Systems Engineer at a small MSP. I got a title bump and a raise a couple of weeks ago. We’re a team of 4 and come Monday we will be a team of 3. This essentially puts me in a senior mentor position. I know one of my team members can handle their own self under pressure while my other colleague lacks the experience / depth of knowledge to own a sufficiently technical case without supervision. 
 We manage everything from firewalls, backups, clusters down to networked and USB printers for most of our clients. At this point my boss expects me to step away from the technical and assume an operational role which would be nearly impossible with the current situation. I have closely worked with these folks and we all know each others’ strengths and weaknesses.
 It all just feels like stepping into someone else’s shoes that are 2 sizes too large.

 I am managing a fairly sized network with two datacenters. Currently we are using stretched VLANs which we would be glad to move away from to something more modern and robust. A third greenfield datacenter is being built and it seems logical to implement a spine-leaf fabric with VXLAN EVPN. We are a Cisco shop which is something I have little influence over. But after doing the research on datacenter technology I believe Cisco is not bad only maybe overpriced.
 I have limited experience with VXLAN technologies and multicast but have been studying the technology for a while. I would be very happy if someone could help me validate things as there are few examples in…]]></summary>

 I'm setting up the on-prem infrastructure for my family's small business (start-up). Currently, there are 10 laptops and approximately 10 users.
 We have Microsoft 365 Business Basic licenses (1 TB storage per user).
 Major requirements for the AD:
  
Locking down application installs (UAC admin only)
 No unnecessary downloads(Torrents, any media etc)
 Forcing logoff during nonactive hours/ forcing Windows updates
 Roaming profiles with predefined software installations
 Remotely accessing laptops for troubleshooting any issues
 File server (For sharing files within the network or outside)
 Daily backups
  
Please suggest anything I missed, it is my first time setting up a server. 
 Note: We are not hosting any applications or using Azure AD in our company. I did not find any use case or need more reading of it's documentation. 
 Questions
  
Which version of Windows Server? 2016 or 2019? Standard or Essentials?
 Should I go for a file server along with the DC or Onedrive is enough?
 Is a server on the premises necessary or Azure AD can do my work?
  
Please guide.

 I am working on a new DWDM project to upgrade our optical line system to a newer version that support SSON.
 Currently we are on the design phase , and we faced a problem during simulating 400G circuits (Higher than 60Gbaud) on one of our long spans , as the modeling tool is reporting very bad OSNR.
 In order to improve the results ; one of the parameters that we changed was the SD (Spectral Density) , and we noticed that the OSNR of the circuit was greatly enhanced once we decreased the Spectral Density.
 Was wondering if anyone can explain the relation between the spectral density and OSNR , also if we changed the spectral density setting on the optical gears , shouldnt that affect the existing signals , as we are changing how the whole spectrum with its frequencies is alocated ?
 Thanks.

 Any idea why I would see such high packet loss between 2 switches and a UDM Pro?
 UDMPro is 192.168.1.1, ping results are from a hardwired macbook to the UDM pro pinging a USW-24 -PoE switch (192.168.1.4) and a USW-24-Poe-PRO (192.168.1.3)
 Both switches are connected independently wired to different ports on the UDM Pro.
 Changed cables out, still seeing loss.
 Problem just started happening this morning and I updated everything to the latest version of firmware (what!)
 I searched /var/log/messages on the pro but didn't see anything untoward either.
 SSH into the UDM pro shows cpu temp and load are nominal. Unifi support tickets are rubbish, probably should switch this crap out.

 So my questions: Currently, our public domain names pointing to public IPs provided by Provider A, how can we get Public DNS to point to the new IPs at the same time?, For example, mail.company.domain.net or adfsproxy.companydomain.net pointing to two public IPs Is this possible? Any issues I should consider?

 Only assured part time despite often doing months of full time work, no wage increases, no permanent full time, no benefits whatsoever. Total toxic workplace .
 I am not sad to see that gone. 
 I had a hunch that something like this may happen, as the new director we got is totally IT illiterate and I'm still wondering how the hell he got the job as he was new to the company. I figured because I couldn't perform the miracles he wanted of me yesterday that he would try and get me removed .
 ​
 Instead it seems to come down from the ownership that they are going in a different direction and plan to outsource me (likely cheaper). 
 I have been trying to find another job, but the job market in my area is cutthroat and a lot of the jobs I have applied for either need more experience, they never return my calls or the posting is cancelled as they don't have the budget for it.
 ​
 Its annoying to go back on EI for the time being, but not much choice.
 ​
 Not sure what the point of this post is, I think maybe just a bit of venting .
 I do take some small comfort that things are going to suck for the other employees shortly, as they are rolling out a new system this week that had the other IT staff running around trying to fix the broken mess so they don't have me to fill the holes of other issues and the ticketing system. 
 There will be complaints streaming in soon and I don't think my remaining senior IT staff will stick around long, as he hired me to help him out and now he has to do what I do on top of his job.

 The first bears a date of January 2004 and (62.5/125) on the jacket. OM1. Yuck.
 The second bears a date of May 2010 and (MM50 PRETIUM 150) on the jacket which Google/Corning says is OM2. Also yuck. But not as yuck.
 The distance marker indicates that the run is 580 feet from conduit mouth to conduit mouth. There's another 30-40 feet coiled up near the termination box on either end.
 And that's not all. The newly selected network closet for each building, where the run will actually enter the switches, will require another 50-100ft on either end.
 So, switch to switch, we're looking at a maximum distance of 860ft / 262meters. It MIGHT be a bit less than that, but not much less.
  
So what's the play here? Can we get 10GBIT/s out of this or are we going to be LACP'ing some 1gig connections to try and get close?
 I don't think 10GBASE-LRM + Mode conditioning patch cable gets us there either; most have said the max distance is 220m. 
 What would you do if you were in my situation?
 We can't pull new Single-Mode fiber for a bunch of stupid reasons, but the main one is that the conduit between the buildings hits an outside junction box. That junction box is... underneath a concrete parking lot now. Yeah. They poured Concrete over it. We've tried pulling on some of the MMF to see if we could use it as a pullcord, but no luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for the best monitoring/reporting tool to run reports and forecast bandwidth usage. The reporting needs to be able to aggregate usage and not just show a monthly report with hourly averages. It needs to be able to capture daily averages in minutes for example during peak usage times. The basic reporting tools built in monitoring tools tend not to be able to do this. I have seen a few products that will aggregate the data because keeping all the data and running a OnDemand report just takes too long over extended periods. It can be a monitoring and reporting tool or just a easy to use reporting tool we can feed API data to for example. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got hired by a small company 3 months ago. The only IT employee for the past 15 years was a guy 60+ and promoted to "Manager" to onboard me and one other, less technical, new hire.
 He gets confused a lot. Admits he feels confused/incoherent sometimes. Takes a lot of days off. Tells us he's in and out of the doctor's offices multiple times a week. Expresses his interest in just sitting back and taking it easy now to let us take over.
 Unfortunately I've also found tons of issues across the system, including the fact that our product we sell to customers is just not very good. Customers are unhappy, and I want to work at a place I am proud of. Our MS licensing is a mess and management doesn't seem interested in hearing my concerns on it. Really... just problems I don't want to deal with since I've learned I'd rather just write SQL than be an IT generalist for a small outdated business.
 So, when an opening came up through someone I know to go back to doing that, I took it, and gave my notice today. It will almost certainly be better for me. I just feel really bad for leaving this guy who has bigger problems than work to be dealing with, and sounded like he was putting a lot of faith in me sticking around.

 Rebooted the server as this was the probably cause of backups failing and it didn’t come up and looks like file table is corrupted and we are going to need to send off to data repair company. 
 No iLO configured so unable to check raid health or other such things. Half the drivers were missing so couldn’t use any of the tools we would usually want to use as couldn’t talk to the hardware and I believe all would have required a reboot to install anyway. No separate system and data drive. All one volume. No hot spare. 
 Turns out raid array was flagging errors for months. 
 A simple reboot and it’s fucked. 
 14 years and my first time needing to deal with something like this. What would you have done differently if anything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 For some reason I'm having some issues with a local BGP session being stuck in active using pathvector (bird 2.0) and pfsense (FRR)
 The IP of the bird router is provided by the frr router's LAN, it's pingable on both sides. 
 Frrs neighbor config is pretty standard, nothing differing from any other established connections there. I'm a little bit confused because it's literally a local connection so no need for multihop! Trying to announce another ASN through a 2nd router basically and upstream it with our main one. 
 Any pointers to look into? We have a handful of peers, I've been doing bgp for a while and am pretty stumped. I'm not seeing anything in the logs, and I'm also just not sure why it's stuck considering the ips are pingable on both sides. No firewall or port filtering, I've made sure to set static routes on the bird router, ASNs are correct, router IDs are not conflicting, etc. It's a local connection, there is no reason that I can tell that it'd get stuck.
 Any help would be kind, thank you!

 So I've been considering the military, specifically the Air Force. Would this look good to a potential employer after my service term? I know military experience looks good in general, especially in networking and security. Serving would also open up funding for further education, which seems to be more and more important.If anyone has experience starting out in the military, I would love to hear it!

 So I'm being challenged on why we are insisting on having the ability to remote wipe corporate emails on personal moblies, specifically Outlook via the Outlook Device Policy.
 The argument is that you can just disable the account and the person cannot get into the mailbox anymore.
 I have argued that what if you don't want to disable the account, you just want to remove the emails.
 I'd appreciate your thoughts as this is being argued by a very senior member of the organisation.
 Also Outlook Device Policy states it should wipe on bad logons. Our policy in Exchange Online states 8 bad attempts, but I can do 20 or more and it doesn't wipe, so I'm note sure what's happening there...

 If your boss comes to you Friday afternoon because another department (let's say marketing) have a really important client thing on the Monday that will require 2 days of work to get something installed, written up or fixed. Something they've known about for 3-6 months but have only approached IT at the last minute because "the previous guy would do it " or it's just expected...
 How many of you would tell them to piss off? Genuine question.
 Edit : WOW! Some great responded guys and gals. My biggest issue has always been that IT departments around the world have been too easy to push over & not willing enough to fight their own corners over unpaid short notice overtime & insisting on new kit
 From these responses it looks like this is changing for the better!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Team, 
 Currently working on a SDWAN environment and I need you input about MSTeams.
 We just switched a site to SDWAN using simply an MPLS transport connection. However, we recently received a report on the quality of the MSTeam. In light of this, I'm curious as to what would be the ideal practice for guaranteeing the MSTeam's priority (e.g. QOS, Symmetrical flow etc) and what steps would be necessary for troubleshooting what I need to examine (e.g. Routing, Latency, utilization)?
 I'm still gathering more information regarding the problem, but one thing I checked is the latency of the MSapplication which is only 100ms, and there is no jitter from the Analytics. No congestion as well. Since DIA is not an option right now, MPLS is our only choice.
 Thank you,
 ​

We'd like to set up load balancing and failover of the VPN connections by enabling VPN connections on 1 other office. I setup 2 dns records with our provider using their lb/failover option, which just requires specifying the desired DNS name, and the multiple IP addresses to use for lb/failover. It is working great, but I'm seeing a possible snag with SSL certs on the Meraki appliance. Is there any problem with creating 2 SSL certs, 1 for each office, which specify different host IP addresses, but the same DNS name? If a custom SSL cert is not used, AnyConnect gives a security pop-up message every time a user connects because it wants the Meraki Dynamic DNS name to be used for connection. Tried creating a cert with GoDaddy and it keeps giving me errors, and neither vendor seems to know what the issue is.

I'm looking at Zoom and RingCentral, and am hoping to get some feedback on either of these companies with respect to their phone system products.
 Background: We currently use Zoom for our videoconferencing needs, as well as our online classroom education. We've been pretty happy with them, and I'm leaning that direction because training would be minimal. Ring has a slick presentation, and it looks like they'd be about 30% cheaper.
 What has been your experience with either of these platforms, and how well did you like the service provided by the company involved when there were technical or administrative (read: billing) issues?
 Thanks!

Barracuda is currently failing entirely to block them, and each email is pretty distinct - however they all contain at least one line I was able to use to set up quarantining. I was attempting to set up quarantining for anything with an emoji in the subject, but barracuda's implementation of regex appears to be broken and they can't even figure it out. This has persisted for more than 24 hours and the volume is very, very high so I thought it was weird I couldn't find anyone else talking about this. 
 If you folks check your filters, do you see these getting caught? Or is anyone else seeing a flood of this exact email campaign slipping through?
 We also had some other unusual test-like emails slip through, and it makes me feel like we're in the midst of something highly targetted, but it's also.... very lazy. So on the one hand I am wondering if this is a bizarre targetted campaign that's just really sloppy, and on the other I'm wondering if this is just what AI spam is going to look like going forward, if it looks like trash to humans but was carefully trained to sneak around whatever email security the target is using.
 Replying to the emails sends an auto reply that sends you through a few URLs, but nothing seemed to be working or trying to do anything. https://imgur.com/a/Q825KHI

 Powershell 7.3 introduces the -Parallel parameter for ForEach-Object, pretty useful and can massively speed things up. After some experimenting, I made some code that may be helpful to others.
 Note that this is for .7z files, installing the 7Zip4Powershell Module adds the command "Expand-7Zip". If you are using regular .zip files, use "Expand-Archive" and it's associated parameters.

If you don't want a folder created for each ZIP, and would prefer they be unzipped into the source directory, just use "$_". #For the ThrottleLimit parameter, set the number to the # of your CPU cores minus 1, otherwise it bogs down the machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry, not sure if it's exactly the right sub for this, and sorry also for kind of a noob question but here I go. 
 In a purely Link state routing protocol world, if a computer wants to send packets to a computer on another autonomous system, how would one routing table knows which router is closest to the other autonomous system?
 also, are ISPs just an enormous network operator with a gigantic routing table for all of their own routers? And when they say that autonomous systems communicate between each other to find the shortest path, do they keep a table of "cross system" paths or do they just communicate every time they need to know what's going on in another autonomous space? I hope I'm being clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 All right, I've had it with the shut down shenanigans! I instruct the users to restart their machines (most often these are laptop users) once they start having weird issues as that resolves a lot of those. I'm just tired of explaining to users (who want to be helpful by the way) that "Shutting it down and turning it on" is not the same as "Restarting". So I have situations where they would say they restarted as asked but uptime tells a different story. With that out of the way, what is the best way to make "Shut down" actually shut the machine down instead of hibernating it or whatever it's doing. Do I run "powercfg.exe /hibernate off" when building the machine? But then I'm not sure if Microsoft would turn it back on with one of their updates. Or would it be better through some group policy? or something else? I just want it permanently gone. What is your experience with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to create a list for new/junior engineers looking to grow. Any one else wish to add to my list, please feel free. What I am laying down are the rules taught to me by my mentor. An engineer who started with Cisco in 1989 and literally designed and oversaw Caterpillar/BMW/Mercedes etc etc etc global networks before he retired.
 Rule #1 Be hungry to learn. Every interaction, even after 30+ years of networking, is an opportunity to learn and grow. Being humble and hungry also makes you more desirable to work with!
 Rule #2 Lab. Even if you think you have the right answer, you are probably wrong if you haven't labbed! If you are learning something new, lab it up. Take packet captures to see if you get the expected packets. Learn to read said packets while in the lab. Never forget to lab.
 Rule #3 RFCs, RFCs, RFCs. Taking the time to look up an RFC is generally faster than contacting a consultant or vendor for a detailed answer. It is likely, they are going to read said RFC before replying back to you.
 Rule #4 Follow the packets. Our job revolves around moving packets from A-B or from C to D-K. Understand where a packet comes in from and why then where it is going to move to next and why. Do this node by node. Whether this is super basic VLAN only or the crazy complex Multicast over EVPN, following the path of the packet is a concept which will never die!
 Rule #5 When following the network path, draw out the topology. You may have 50 devices in your whole network but the packet for source to destination may only cross 4 devices. Understanding this will always greatly simply things and prevent a 4-day marathon of troubleshooting an issue. In most cases, shortens those sessions to just a few hours or less.
 Rule #6 See rule #1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I help maintain dnsReaper which is a subdomain takeover tool. It's free, available on GitHub and docker and looks for domains vulnerable to domain takeovers.
 Today we've added 2 new integrations!
 Project discovery have a massive database of subdomains called CHAOS and you can now query and test domains in dnsReaper.
 We've also added SecurityTrails, which also has a huge public subdomain list.
 This means that you can just point dnsReaper at a bug bounty domain and let it run. There will be false positives for sure, but we have 61 signatures so hopefully there will be some nice easy findings too.
 Our blog post on the new features is here:
 https://punksecurity.co.uk/blog/dnsreaper_pd/
 Our GitHub is over here:
 https://github.com/punk-security/dnsReaper
 It's a free tool that we built just to highlight this issue and educate. Please give it a star and share it, we'd appreciate it.

 Our company has a mix of Windows and Linux & AIX machines. We patch all the Windows machines every month using PDQ, WSUS, and SCCM. However, we don't patch the Linux/AIX machines at all. I'm not a strong Linux person but I'm looking for information on how people manage the non-Windows based computers.
 Are there programs that can inventory and automate the process by sending patches to the machines that need them? Can I just send a command to every machine and they will install what they need? Can I specify only Security patches vs all patches? What options are there that I should look into?
 I'd prefer free tools but would consider paid ones if they are worth the cost. Our company is currently looking at BigFix because it can apparently patch every OS out there, but I've read a lot of things about how crazy expensive and complicated it is so if there's a better way to go, let me know.
 Thanks.

 Secondarily, patching. Ivanti is currently used for Windows patching and Ansible for Linux patching. Looking to maybe streamline that if possible.
 Any suggestions would be great. The product doesnt have to be FOSS, but certainly can be if its the right tool.

 ​
 I am reaching out in this sub as when I search for thin client issues or questions, this sub seems to appear the most on google.
 ​
 I am working on deploying an Hp T540 thin client as a kiosk to limit functionality to a specific site. We use windows configuration designer to provision a kiosk package for all versions of windows. 
 ​
 My colleague and I are running into an issue where when we run the kiosk package on the thin client and log into the account declared in the xml file (.\user), we can't log in. We enter the password, it says welcome, spins and then says signing out. We never get to the desktop. When we remove the kiosk package from the device, logged in as the local admin account, we are able to log back into .\user.
 ​
 I connected with HP and they were stumped on it, and my colleague says he checked through the registry and couldn't find anything.
 ​
 Do you all have any ideas of what could be the issue?

 I've seen this with 2 enterprise applications and reported it to both the producers. One acknowledged it was an issue, the other didn't respond.
 SysAdmins, fire up your Task Manager and check it.

 I started at my current role with basically no knowledge, which I thought was made pretty clear during interviewing ect that i've built my own computer and feel confident enough with hardware related issues, but software/AD/troubleshooting is all new to me
 Anyway, I'm 8 months into my helpdesk role, have had basically no training a real sink or swim environment, while they haven't said anything bad about me, I just feel like I'm not doing good enough, 90% of the tickets I get I can't do or spend an hour googling how to do it. 
 Worst part is, people get paid less than me and know how to do 10x what I know, confuses me alot.
 I barley understand AD, I can barley setup local-admin accounts without getting confused or needing to confirm I'm doing it right, it's also an MSP so every clients setup is different, I don't understand basic networking like DCHP, DNS ect and I've tried to study, I've home labbed and I can set things up and fix things when following guides without a problem, the issue arises when I don't have a guide to follow. 
 Can anyone recommend some good study material for DNS, DHCP to understand them so I can get my head around it in different environments, sick of feeling stupid every single day.

 I hope someone can answer this. I have a riser cage for my Proliant Gen10 dl360 1u server and I want to populate the x8 slot on it with a NVME drive card and a x16 slot with a Nvidia GPU such as RTX A4000. My question is, if I use both slots on the riser cage at the same time, will I lose any performance? The riser cage connects to the motherboard using something which looks like a dual PCIE x16 slots. Does anyone know how it works? 
 Here's an ebay listing for the riser cage I have.

 We have meetings rooms where's due to small SSDS in the machines, they got fed up with having to remove user profiles too often rather then fix it, (bigger ssd, delprof2 script or many others)
 so they decided it be a good idea to have an autologin to generic account, with a move to 365 users are logging to teams and clicking the ''ok'' to sign into all apps as its more prominent in the menu.
 this then means upon login out of teams, that its now connected on the school or account so its logged in everywhere.
 I'm explaining this to them and asking for it to be removed and fix the root cause issue I mentioned earlier... (i've already asked about windows guest mode)
 ​
 ​
 they have come back and said below, can you let me know if this actually exists or are they out to lunch?
 ''
 if this is the case then most likely they have the single-use version of 365 rather than the shared switch which stops the saving of creds 
 log a call for any that you find and we can switch them over ''

 I am having a strange problem. DFS-R is replication files and folders and fully "in-sync". If I change, add, remove a file, everyting is working.
 ​
 But: If I rename a folder, the change is _sometimes_ replicated and _sometimes_ not or it takes a very long time, until the change is replicated.
 Get-DfsrBacklog does not show any pending changes for folder-renames.
 Changes of files INSIDE the non-rename-replicated-folder are changed fine.
 ​
 Did you ever see that behaviour and do you have any idea on how to fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of information technology, data centers and their equipment play a pivotal role in supporting critical operations. At the heart of every data center lies the 19" server rack – a silent workhorse that has evolved significantly over the years. In this article, we take a journey through time to explore the history and technological advancements that have shaped 19" server racks into the indispensable components they are today.
 The Genesis of 19" Server Racks
 Back in the day, data centers looked nothing like the sleek facilities we see today. Those massive mainframes occupied entire rooms, leaving little space for anything else. Can you imagine that? As the need for better organization and efficient data management arose, the ingenious concept of server racks was born in the 1970s. But wait, there's more! The 19" width standard came into play, bringing order to the chaotic world of data centers and allowing different equipment to coexist peacefully in standardized enclosures.

 -Laptops / VDI / Windows 365 etc.
 -Access Points

 -Identity Management

 I have done some good research on the latest best practices for these and I am curious if I am missing any points.

 We are looking into MS Defender and JAMF Wandera Radar since we already have both licensed anyway.

Ideally we’d like to use Defender tho as we already have alerting, reporting and processes established around it.

 Are there specific hardware and software tools one would use to look at channel utilisations and that sort of thing?

Not really looking at jobs yet, just mainly brushing up on old subjects and equipment configs that i haven't done in awhile and a thought struck me. Now that we live in a post covid world, what is the outlook for Network engineers to be fully remote? At the beginning of 2021 i worked as a temp IT support tech for a few months for a local resort whose network support was located in a different state. Yes, the engineers would visit every now and again but mostly they would remote in whenever there was a problem or a need to. This resorts company had properties nation wide but their network support team was based in FL. I'm curious as to how common this type of arrangement is. Thanks for reading, look forward to all your comments.

 I remember the first few times when I started getting pushback on this, and realised those days were coming to an end. The early internet was such a wild west, I miss those days.

 I haven't been a real Sysadmin for 15 years or so now... but it is in your blood and part of your soul. Once a Sysadmin, always a Sysadmin.
 What I do now is help my client solve problems with a broad range of technologies that we sell (of course) by building actual Minimal Viable Products. Real working code that can do the job on a very narrow focus or a very limited functionality. 4-6 week Epics, 2 to 4 Epics max. 
 So I was quite excited when a group of Syadmins approached our team and asked to try and solve their problem they have.

All devices on the /24 have their own firewall, and are considered to be "on the public internet". I would like to use OSPF to distribute routes between these routers so that, for example, a laptop with a private IP behind Router 1 could print to a printer that has a private IP behind Router 2. 
 Am I correct in assuming that it would be a bad idea to use the interfaces associated with the public /24 for distributing routes via OSPF, because that would effectively be routing packets from internal devices over an un-trusted network? Or is this a non-issue and I am over-complicating it? I am currently planning on creating a new interface on each router with a new broadcast domain, purely for distributing routes.

 I'll read the docs and tutorials, but I'd like to have an idea of what I'll be doing before I get started on them as to set my focus.
 My intended setup is pretty basic and for a small site:
  
Am looking at 4 or more XV series access points, will add more if needed.
 
Two SSIDs: one for the internal network VLAN and one for 'visitor wifi' VLAN.
 
WPA2 PSK Passphrase authentication.
 
SSID for internal network VLAN to be restricted by device / MAC address.
 
 Have registered with cnMaestro so I can start having a play before the access points arrive and it looks fairly intuitive.
 Any pointers and/or a brief rundown of what to expect would be appreciated, thank you.

 I have the simplest possible topology in gns:
  
Cisco: e0/0(10.10.10.1/24) <---> Debian FRRouting eth0(10.10.10.99/24)
 router eigrp 888
 network 10.10.10.0/24
  
Adjacencies will immediately form, but then FRRouting drops the adjacency with the log message "EIGRP packet header type 5 unsupported." Timers expire and the process begins again.
 I started with the debian distro package which I think is 8.4.2. Then I tried the .deb package from frrouting.org which is the latest, 8.5.2. In both of these versions eigrpd crashes and is restarted by the watchdog over and over.
 I even built it from scratch and used the forked eigrpd repo. At least with this version eigrpd no longer crashes, but it still cannot maintain an adjacency.
 I'm kind of out of ideas at this point. Does anyone have experience with this?

 I am so overwhelmed. Everything is behind jumpboxes (poorly documented) so it’s difficult to understand what to jump through in order to connect to anything, making manual network discovery difficult. 
 I come from a Cisco shop, and everything is Juniper and Arista here. 
 There are literally dozens of VRFs inside their internal MPLS core. They run EVPN and VXLAN, stuff I’ve never worked with before. There are dozens and dozens of firewalls. The team has started a new network segmentation project, and there is little to no documentation on what subnets belong to each segment, what ‘zones’ are in each segment, etc. 
 I feel like I’m drowning. Normally I try to buckle down and start from the core and work my way outward, documenting physical and logical connections, but this place has literally hundreds of devices in the core. The routing is extremely complex with tons of BGP, MPLS, EVPN, VXLAN, VRFs everywhere, SDWAN.
 Just need some advice. Words of encouragement. SOMETHING. I haven’t worked with any of this stuff and feel so damn burnt out at the end of the day that I physically can’t get myself to study anything. I feel like it’s only a matter of time until I’m fired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a network set up and the firewall are advertising default originate into isis. The firewalls are doing iBGP between them and because of the AD of 200 routes prefer the ISIS interface to go to the other side of the network and will come in through the other firewall on return traffic because it is the default route. I was thinking it would be beneficial to set up ISIS peering across the same link as the BGP as this is a point to point and will have a reduced cost allowing the traffic from the outside networks to route that way. Will I have an issue peering two isis neighbors both advertising the default route through default originate or will I need to filter it between hosts somehow?
 Edit: thinking about it I would think the local static default route will take precidence in the firewall and the default-originate route would never be installed unless we were to lose internet peering on one side. This sounds like a win-win setting up this way.

 I cant find any IT jobs that pay more than my current salary (80k) without insane 10+ years of experience. 
 I know im stagnant in my career right now, ive gotten multiple offers from MSPs but for the same 80k im currently making. Im thinking I should take it and put in my time for 5 years or so and then ill be able to get those higher paying jobs? right?
 But if i stay at my current job for 5 years ill get my stupid 3% raise every year but gain no new valuable experience with the same technologies, and still be unable to qualify for those 100k+ jobs. right?

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory to warn network defenders about exploitation of CVE-2023-3519, an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway. In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization’s non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim’s active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network-segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement.

 i want to create an ACL for my IoT vlan so my IoT devices can talk to other IoT devices and the internet but not the rest of my networking. IoT is vlan 10 and has ips in 192.168.10.0.
 access-list ip IoT

 30 permit any 192.168.10.0/24 any
 I don't know how or where to apply it. Should this be applied to my IoT vlan OR the vlan interface? And does it go in, out or both? Do I need reverese rules?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For instance, my boss wants to move towards containerization. It's one of the biggest buzzwords nowadays, but I feel like no one in my department has a full understanding of it, just the core concepts. Therefore, when they containerize something, they basically just create a docker container of it on some random VM, and that's it.
 That being said, when I do something, I like to do it right. Best practice. Learning about containerization is one thing, but getting familiar with setting up an entire infrastructure dedicated to containerization is what I'm aiming towards. What are the tools available to us, both open source and paid? Can I just set up a Portainer machine and run all of our containers there? We've looked into OpenShift but it's insanely expensive. What's a better alternative?
 When I start down these rabbit holes, I do so with a fiery motivation. But eventually I get overwhelmed with not knowing what I don't know, and getting lost with the billion options, albeit none that are comprehensive.
 That's just one example of many in the infinitely complex world of IT. How do you deal with stuff like that?

 Anyways, I've got a large office-production site that has a 10.32.0.0/16 subnet. We also have 10.33.0.0/16, 10.35.0.0/16 and 10.37.0.0/16 for various systems/voip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why does anyone let vendors build solutions in our environments with bad practices like using named users instead of service accounts for databases?
 I have a database that runs under a named user account that was built by a vendor and the named account belongs to a person who's no longer there. So of course we've already terminated the user and they're no longer in AD. If I try to create a new user with the same username of course the SID doesn't match so it can't authenticate to the database to do any owner operations or assign a new db_owner. Of course because we let the vendor manage their stuff in our network they didn't add my team as db_owner I can't do anything in the DB and they've lost the default DB creds which they never provided to us in the first place.
 If anybody has any ideas how I can get past this problem without having to rebuild the database for an existing production solution I would be eternally grateful.
 And if you work for a vendor: I'm not mad at you but push back against crap practices like this. If you manage a solution for your clients, in their network or yours, it's your responsibility to maintain appropriate access to data and resources. That means making sure you don't delete the only account which has access to those resources. Same goes for everyone, of course.
 [Edit] ok, not all vendors suck. That blanket statement has been removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently using a classic VPN setup to allow our employees to connect to the office network and GCP, but we want to enhance our security and adopt a zero trust or overlay network approach. I've been researching two main overlays for this task - Netmaker and Tailscale - but I'm having difficulty deciding between them.
 Our setup involves hosting some products in GCP and running internal services on Dell servers. We have a mix of workstations with different operating systems, and our network is segregated into VLANs.
 Both Netmaker and Tailscale offer different advantages and disadvantages. Tailscale, being a userspace WireGuard, might have slower speeds, while Netmaker could require more deployment and maintenance effort. However, the choice between the two may also depend a bit on how far we want to take the zero trust approach. For instance, should communication between two servers internally go through this solution? Is having to manage the ACL settings in a JSON file a good or bad thing (infra as code)? 
 If any of you have encountered a similar dilemma or have experience with either Netmaker or Tailscale, I'd greatly appreciate your insights. Did you end up choosing one of these products, and how did it work out for you? Are there other products that could be better than the two I'm currently looking at?

 This problem is probably old hat but I'm having trouble getting a solution: (I also tried r/WindowsServerAdmin)
 I need to monitor Windows Domain Users (they use the same computer/IP every day) web access. For example, I want to see a list of web domains they access. They are accessing inappropriate content 'family filtering' provided by cloudflare (1.1.1.3, 1.0.0.3) doesn't block (such as Maxim, SportsIllustrated). This way I can see what they are accessing, as to block them. Currently, I can't block what I don't know about.
 We are using a Windows Domain, and Windows DNS with forwarding to cloudflare 1.1.1.3.
 Preferably I'd like something that uses native Windows logging features, but if that's not available, a FOSS solution would be 2nd choice. I'm trying to avoid buying products from SolarWinds and similar vendors.
 For my purposes, getting a list of web domains accessed is good enough. These users don't have access to change their DNS server settings, and if they can figure out how to bypass DNS filtering by going to a numerical IP I'd die from shock.
 Many thanks!

 I am the founder of Netdata, the open-source, real-time, performance monitoring for systems, containers and applications.
 Today we released a new version of Netdata (v1.41.0) that features a completely updated UI, dashboard and charts.
 Multi-node / multi-instance charts
 When you have a Netdata Parent with multiple nodes, all of them are now on the dashboard at the same time. Each chart is aggregating metrics from all nodes, to give you an infrastructure level view of the metrics.
 The same happens when you have multiple disks, network interfaces, containers, etc, even if they come from a single node. All of them will be aggregated into 1 chart, allowing you to also query the min, max, average, etc. of them.
 Machine-Learning first!

 Im currently trying to setup Autopilot and i'm currently stuck on an issue where i'm trying to automatically sync a Sharepoint location so that it appears in Explorer without the user having to do it themselves.
 The problem im faced with is that after following guides i've realised that we don't have the below folder location appearing in Registry which explains why its not working.
 Has anyone faced this issue before? OneDrive is working, is syncing to the business AD account, is available through the web version, so it's definately working properly.
 Location that is missing: 
 "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive\Accounts\Business1"
 Any help would be appreciated

 I can add the images manually without issue, or even copy/paste the image itself. But I can't copy a chuck of text AND an image and then paste into the signature field.
 To be clear, I made a template in Word. It had all the details required by HR and management. It also had several images. All the user needed to do was copy the block of text and images, then paste into the Outlook signature file and edit the details to be personally relevant. Simple. Now I only get the text and the placeholders for the images. Frustrating.
 Anyone have a viable workaround that is easy for technically challenged people to follow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a case where I have some thousands of devices sending syslog to a central location via a hub/spoke VPN solution. Each connection may be a trickle of syslogs, or may be bursty during a security event, but still relatively low bandwidth requirements. However, once they all land at the one VPN concentrator there is quite a flow of those syslog messages on the wire. We are trying to send those to a log analyzer/SIEM in the cloud, and we are trying to overcome some bandwidth cost constraints there. Syslog is normally fire-and-forget, so if we have any bandwidth contention, it is possible for some of those messages to get lost.
 What do you recommend to overcome this possible data loss? More bandwidth is the easy option, but even then how do you scale for an event that bursts above even that? I'm thinking some sort of relay that stores and forwards, but forwards across the lower bandwidth link with a reliable method (RELP or the like?) to remove or significantly lessen the likelihood of data loss.
 Or am I looking at this all wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me it’s starting to get impossible. I’m a solo admin for my organization. I supervise a few help desk/techs even have to pickup some tickets and do some onsite visits usually. My manager has strictly forbidden me from teaching anyone how to do anything outside their current roles, meaning it’s just me for the company office. Manager does not have a background in IT so they can’t help with much.
 As the company grows I’m losing more of my free time which is irritating me as I want my two days off a week to spend time with my kids and relax. It’s also forcing my spouse to have to shorten hours that she can work which means we actually have less money than we did last year. Before anyone says get a babysitter, I’m not paying someone to watch my kids, I don’t believe I should have to.
 I make 50k a year doing my job and they won’t consider giving me a raise until fourth quarter 2024. I feel like this would just get worse if I moved on with a larger organization based on reading horror stories here and by talking to others in the field.
 I’m currently expected to work 50+ hours a week at this point and since I’m salary no OT for me. CEO firmly believes salary = availability is 24/7. I’ve tried ignoring emails and texts while off but I learned quickly it is not tolerated and treated with write ups. I’ve been told as well to just cash out PTO since I’m the only one that can do a lot of things. My manager says “You being absent for a period of time would be problematic”.
 I’m starting to feel like IT is for people who don’t have families or a life. I’ve invested a lot of time, money, education into this field but Im kinda considering getting out while I’m still young and can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We just started receiving reports a few days ago that when a user tries to open a file on our file server (on-prem) it would take a long time to load. So we tested this and confirmed that (for testing) a 6 MB file takes a couple of minutes to open. Biggers files take longer.
 We've checked the potential server having the issue and compared it with other servers, and we have the same issue on all servers, not just one. We use VMWare and the disks, CPU, and memory all look good. We tried flipping to our standby Cisco ASA firewall, but that did not change anything. VMs can transfer between each other just fine. 
 The other day, we had one of our switch stacks re-built but that should have only impacted one location, which does not house the servers.
 So it is looking like a switch issue, but I was not part of the switch maintenance that was done and if it was only done to our one location that does not have the servers in it, why would that impact our servers?
 Any thoughts are appreciated.
 Thanks!

 This is my first time recruiting, and i'm not sure what's the best way to proceed. Paid/expensive tools are out of the question. I could pay for one myself, if it's very cheap. less than 20 candidates

 I'm sure this is a super simple question but I'm new to the platform.
 I'm looking to add 1 app to 1 phone without removing everything else on the phone. I've figured out how to create the app policy and that's all fine but I can only seem to add the policy to the whole group rather than the specific device.
 Is there a way to do this better than copying all of the apps etc from the phones current group to a new group and then assigning the app to the app policy to that group?
 I'm probably over complicating it in my head 😂
 Any help would be greatly appreciate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am posting this as the only thread I have found mentioning it is reporting problems after installing rather than during install.
 I see on that thread that at least some others are experiencing the same issue. In my case I am getting an influx of calls to report systems running very slowly, symptoms include taking 5 mins from clicking to doing anything, Microsoft Office/Outlook constantly crashing.
 I connected to some of the affected systems and in task manager the resources are ok, plenty of CPU/Memory available and, oddly, SSD running at 0-10%. I was able to reproduce the issue, composing a new email in Outlook and sending or closing that window caused an app crash, task manager crashed when I tried to close it.
 In every case, KB5028166 was installing. On some systems this update would get stuck at 73%, 74% or 90%. When rebooting, the system would hang on the blue backgound rebooting message but the circle of dots that usually appears above it was missing. It would sit here for 40+ minutes after which I had to force a reboot.
 Eventually, after several of these reboots, it seems to finally complete after which system responsiveness goes back to normal.
 I thought I would post about it to see how widespread the issue was and if anyone had found a better way to install the update. I have seen it affecting Lenovo Thinkpads and Dell Optiplex PCs, Windows 10 Pro 22H2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System architecture:
 ROV (BOAT) - Sonar sensor with screen on it that has an ethernet port meant for sharing data between sensor modules (rx+,rx-,tx+,tx-), there is no video out connection.
 Base Station (PC) - Standard laptop
 The aim is to "share" the screen from the sensor onboard the ROV to the laptop so you can view the sonar graphs live rather than just rely on data which is collected on a sd card. A solution would be to use 4G routers at both ends and use VPN tunnelling to create a link. I think I will be able to use VLC streaming to gain access to the sensor screen from the base station laptop (I have seen someone make this work). However, I am not sure on the exact configurations and settings required Networking/LAN is really something i have no idea about I'm an electrical/aerospace engineer, so this is alien to me.
 Could I for example connect the sensor to a 4g router (TP link Wireless AC750) with an RJ45 cable and have a usb 4G modem connected (prepaid/postpaid 4G). Have the same setup on the base station with the laptop and using a VPN gain connection between them? I think this is called site to site IPsec VPN correct me if I'm wrong, it's quite confusing for me I have even heard the term DMZ host and not sure which to use. Or alternatively would a ubiquity Bullet AC work this uses their AirMax Protocol (based on TDMA) WiFi whihc has great range with the right antenna.
 Also, as a side topic, if the above were correct, can I connect 2 devices (sonar, onboard pc) to the same router onboard so that they share the same network. Is it possible to use that network to get the sonar screen live and at the same time use something like tightVNC to gain access to the onboard pc remotely from the base station? if they are all on the same network/LAN it should be possible they would just have different IP addresses?
 Thanks for the replies in advance I really appreciate it.

 My question is about GPUs, as their tasks will also be moderately expensive on GPU ressources. Previously i had difficulties working with GPUs on a Proxmox Server and VMs. In my opinion Proxmox is not really made for piping through GPUs into VMs and i dont know if you can even split GPU ressources to multiple VMS. On the other hand Proxmox is low cost and i am already familiar with it but it does not seem like the best platform for this use case
 Which Virtualization platform or Operating System does make sense for this task? 
 Would it make more sense to have dedicated GPUs for every VM or is it easy to split ressources?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. 
 I'm working for a small company with nine employees, which doesn't have that many requirements concerning hosting - a super-plain, no-frills, static site with medium traffic. For some reason, the hosting provider (a small local company) we've been using so far sent a notification that they're raising the price starting next month without any rational explanation. 
 My employer isn't happy about that and asked me to look into another hosting service. He's one kind of miser that would rather hang himself than pay an extra $40 a month without a reasonable justification (I get panic attacks when I remember the circles of hell I went through to get a raise a few months back).
 For the last few days, I've been looking into all these Hosting Services Compared, trying to find something that would suit my boss's financial requirements and, at the same time, would provide quality service. While researching, it hit me that I could open my own company and make some extra cash each month. 
 I know a couple of similar companies (with some I worked in the past) that work with the same hosting, and I imagine they also aren't happy with the price increase. I don't think that it would be hard convincing them to switch to my service. 
 I talked with a fellow friend who works in a hosting company today. But instead of sharing any advice, he tried talking me out of this, saying that it'll be a pain in the ass and not worth even trying because it'll be hard to compete with the giants that have a ton of employees.
 I'd really appreciate it if someone here who runs or has owned a small hosting business could share their experience. I'm particularly interested in the potential income, pitfalls, and problems that may await me if I decide to go on with the idea. 
 Thanks in advance for your help.

 On an IX, why would I start peering with other ASNs, if both of us already connect to the official route servers? I already know all their routes, only thing changing would be I learn them twice. 
 Possible explanations I came up with:
 - Stability - we are no longer dependent on the availability of the route servers
 - Security - I can specifically choose which routes I allow from peer X 
 On the other hand:
 - Managing peering with a lot of peers creates extra work, extra (duplicate) routes

 The new error that is appearing is:
 An authentication error has occurred.
 The Local Security Authority cannot be contacted
 Remote computer: [redacted]
 This could be due to an expired password.
 RDP into a local account works.
 RDP into a domain account does not work.
 Domain user is set to local admin and both administrators and Remote Desktop Users are authorized.
 There is no password reset flag on the account.
 Confirmed firewall is allowing RDP on local network.

 I have looked around for a solution and am unable to find one that works. Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Hoping for any insight that could be provided.
 A few weeks ago we turned on our tamper protection setting for most devices.
 I am making some security changes today and it seems the changes aren't applying properly due to tamper protection. So I decided to disable it until devices had synced the changes and applied them.
 However upon trying to change the policy to "Off" instead of "On" in Intune, all I get is errors. Similarly now switching back from "Off" to "On" produces the same error.
 Tamper Protection Blob
 Error Code 65000
 Error Type 2
 All devices are linked to MDE through the 365 portal.
 I can't help but shake the feeling this is some side-effect of MS recently linking the Intune security policies into the Defender 365 Admin centre.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 I've been at this for 4 hours please send help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry, dumb question, in my Cisco router, static routes usually have a next hop ip of a device in a directly connected network, eg if my router R1 has an interface with an ip of 10.1.1.1, I might see this static route in R1: ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.1.2 Where 10.1.1.2 is the ip of a directly connected different Cisco router (R2). Is it possible for this next hop ip address to be NOT directly connected to R1? Eg could R1 hypothetically have a static route like this: ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 8.8.8.8 (I know it’s Google dns, I’m just using it as an example of an ip out on the internet). Would R1 actually send the traffic to 8.8.8.8 despite it being not directly connected to R1? Thanks.

 We got a request today from a client wanting an audit of thier printers. To have all the drivers checked to ensure they are up to date.
 Printers are instaled on a print server and they are mapped via intune.
 At a first glance it seems straight forward enought to check all the printers one by one to see what driver is installed. But even then, there is nothing signifying the driver "version". In the printer properties it just specifies the driver bieng used no version/dates at all
 The other thing is, Printing is working fine across all printers. Why do they need to be updated?
 How would you all tackle this? Would you just for the sake get the latests driver for each printer and update all the drivers anyways?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I currently have four ISP paths to the same networks, all of which are advertised via BGP to my firewalls (Checkpoint Gaia r81.10). These consist of two clusters, one located at each site. The BGP configuration is functioning correctly without any issues.
 However, when these routes are redistributed into OSPF (Cisco), problems arise. Everything operates as expected until we start conducting failover tests. We sequentially disconnect ISP routers 1 through 3 in an attempt to force traffic through each router along the path. When we reach router 4, everything still continues to function properly.
 The issue emerges when router 1 is reconnected. As soon as this happens, it immediately expects, via BGP, that the traffic will be routed through it. However, the OSPF routing table has not been updated at this point and is still pointing towards router 4. This creates a black hole, as the routes are expected to come from router 4 via OSPF, but from the perspective of BGP, router 1 is now online.
 The underlying problem is that router 4 never lost its link state since it still owns the routes (OSPF).
 I hope I have managed to clearly explain this complex scenario. If anyone can shed light on how to resolve this issue, please do reach out. If there is something incorrect with my configuration, I am open to suggestions. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."

 I work for an MSP, there are pros and cons as there are at any job.
 At this MSP, we get paid anywhere between 30-50% more than the average industry salary but it comes with cons, we can manage anywhere from 3-5 projects at once and change projects on a monthly/bi-monthly basis or can extend for anywhere up to a year. 
 Some projects are great where others aren’t, ranging from free range cloud computing through different providers, cyber sec to writing compliance documentation day in and out.
 There is always something new to learn and study up on.
 So the question is, would you do it?

 to my knowledge, wordpad is included with every single recent version of Windows (maybe excepting those N/S/E stripped-down versions)... but, again, all the discussion i've seen is calling this an Office issue.
 has there been any further information/guidance regarding this CVE? is this actually just an "everybody -- including home users -- needs to apply this mitigation" sort of thing? i just haven't been hearing that in press/blogs/etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 We have 2 service providers in our network which are connected to 2 different switches. ISP 1 is just connected to Switch A and ISP 2 is connected to Switch B. The ports connected on the Switches are configured on different VLANs for each ISP. The switches are then connected to firewalls in HA.
 So it's like, ISP 1 --> Switch A --> FW 1 And ISP 2 --> Switch B --> FW 2
 Switch A is just connected to Fw 1 on 2 ports which are configured on corresponding VLANs for each ISP and same connection is on Switch B just connecting to Fw 2 on 2 ports.
 We are trying to set up internet using 2nd ISP but I am unable to ping it's gateway from either of the firewalls. If we connect a cable directly from the ISP box, we get internet.
 I am not sure where the issue is, can you please help?
 Thanks

 My understanding is the vbond definitely needs one for edge bring up as they will be using only public IP on VPN 0 to authenticate, that part is clear.
 So can all 3 controllers be behind dynamic nat on a firewall? Or do they each need to be 1to1 static nat?
 What I'm trying to understand is what are the public IP requirements to bring up all three controllers on Prem.

 Given that everything is in the cloud and SaaS for an example office network discussed here, what are the best practices for their firewall and network security? 1 GBit/s WAN uplink (one IPV4 address and a /64), no local servers, no printers, just wired computers and ip phones and wireless smartphones and tablets.
 Is a hardware firewall really needed or a packet filter between LAN and WAN sufficient? Basically, can such a not very large company use a consumer/home user router (with a standard stateful packet filter rejecting incoming new connections, passing through all established connections) or are there security considerations for business-grade hardware? (Things like dual wan not needed or simply solved by having spare of the same router hardware as it’s cheap).

 One of my team members is my supervisor but in that weird position where you're not quite middle management but heavily involved in the logistical and planning of everything they're on meetings close to 75% of their day. The other has been here almost as long and is my direct senior on the team, really nice guy and a walking encyclopedia on everything we have here. 
 Fast forward to this week, encyclopedia guy got a great offer which he couldn't turn down and is leaving at the end of the month. Glad he's getting what he has earned and deserves, but now it's just me and my super. 
 I'm still not even past probation, haven't been added to our on-call rotations yet, but I will be taking over encyclopedia's workload. How fucked am I? Do I negotiate a pay rise considering I wasn't hired under the pretense of this sheer amount of extra work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Many mobile devices connect via both cellular and wifi, but don’t even need a local DNS anymore, just an IP and a default route. All traffic goes to cloud servers anyway (let’s ignore services like AirDrop for now).
 When designing a primitive wifi network (PoE switch and # wireless APs) solely for smartphones and tablets (no IoT, let’s say a guest wifi in a hotel or library), how does it improve security (overall and for individual devices) to firewall (packet filter or hardware) compared to just directly connecting the network to the internet (fiber uplink, just setting a default route to the switch’s SFP+ WAN interface)?
 Client isolation (everybody can just access WAN, not nearby clients) can be a security improvement (hotel wifi) or disadvantage (school wifi), but how about incoming connections?
 Because when the mobile devices leave the wifi, they anyway could be vulnerable via cellular (some mobile ISPs deploy public addresses also on IPv4, smartphone is directly reachable=vulnerable from the world). The wifi basically is just to bypass the expensive cellular interface and bridge the devices via cheap wifi in this scenario.
  
Is it necessary to consider VLANs if clients are isolated and only access the WAN/cloud? Eg. one ESSID+VLAN for staff and guests on their own ESSID+VLAN? Does it really have security improvements?
  
Any ideas or best practices for such a wifi scenario?

I've got some networking changes coming down the pipe and I need to move this connection on the N3024f side to a couple of the SFP 1G ports (Gi1/0/1-24). The SFP+ DAC cables I've been using won't work (in theory, and in practice, I tried them..) between SFP and SFP+ ports.
 What's the right DAC cable (or right kind of cable)? Due to the switches being a bit on the old side (I know..) I'm getting a fair amount of conflicting information about whether it's possible at all or what DAC cables might work? It seems like some people have backwards compatibility luck connecting SFP and SFP+ ports with DAC cables (provided the SFP+ side is locked 1G speed), but its not clear how much of this is the cable or what type of cable or whether it's some kind of vendor specific thing.
 I could always just use a couple of the N2048p copper ports to the N3024f RJ combo ports and be done with it, but the N2048p side is pretty full and I'd like to not lose usable access ports in the process. Another alternative option is using optics between the switches or 1G RJ45 ports on the N2048p side to the combo ports on the 3024f side.
 But DAC cables would overall be a better setup -- less parts, etc, but its not clear it will work or the cables for it to work even exist.

 Clicking ok won't fix it, allthough it does remove permissions added manually to the policy-folder (was curious if it does anything at all).
 Probably my predecessors tempered with it somehow but we can't check back on that. 
 The sysvol seems fine to me, as the inheritance is not active and permissions applied look at least somewhat reasonable (filepermission.jpg) but looking at the gpo-permission I get the feeling that it should'nt be so much. I suspect said predecessors once activated inheritance on those 2 policies, as they get all those permissions from the top level. 
 So on the one hand I'd really like to resolve this inconsistency and on the other hand ask about if the top level should really have THAT much in its permissions (gpo_permission_X.jpg). 
 As it is the default domain policy I backed off just resetting the permissions to prevent breaking something that actually works as it doesn't seem to produce any problems currently.

 i ask this because the other method where S encrypts a message with S's private key and send its to R to decrypt with S's public key its known for authentication and Non-repudiation (because you know it only came from S) and integrity (because if it was intercepted, decrypted, modified and reencrypted by the attacker and sent to R then it wouldn't be decryptable with S's public key). so why isn't the first method the same and known for its integrity? if anything isn't the first method more accurate? 
 on a separate question i understand this second method is bad for confidentiality (because anyone can decrypt the message with S's public key), but good for integrity - so what is the point of hashing? if S did encrypt a hash digest to the message, the message can still be intercepted, decrypted, modified, reencrypted by the attacker and sent to R but would result in a hash mismatch, the same way the second method's wouldnt be decryptable with S's public key.
 If hashing is just a 100% sure fire way to know the message hasn't been modified, why is the second method also known for integrity? 
 sorry, long question. thank you for any advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evening folks.
 This is really bugging the hell out of me. We have a bunch of DL's here, and we would rather like to leverage our CA to give said DL's certificates.
 I wrote a powershell script that, using the HPE powershell commandlets, will generate a CSR, acquire the PEM from said CA, and install the certificate to iLO.
 However, it's a bit clunky and requires us to do... Well, something.
 I know there's a bug in 2.72, which most of the DL's are on, but I updated a couple to 2.92, and here I am still scratching my head.
 Automatic certificate enrollment seems to ask for the following information;
  
Server URL - As far as I can tell this is the FQDN for our certificate server, and the appropriate /certsrv/mscep_admin/. This is the only URL that it accepts that I've tried.
 
Challenge password - No problem, retrieved from that URL.
 
 *CA Certificate - Here, I start to scratch my head. The NDES page offers a thumbprint, and no certificate. I cannot find this thumbprint associated with any certificate. I have, however, tried teh CA root certificate. I have also, out of morbid curiosity, tried the PEM certificate I generated via certreq.
 It errors out, and tells me to check basically all the settings and DNS.
 I'm not a CA whizz, so I feel like I've missed something along the way. Someone before my time set this CA server up, and anyone I've asked internally has been perplexed as to why it doesn't work too.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on what I've missed?

 Hope you can help.
 We have an Sr.exec who insists on using LAN when at his desk (even though we have a banging Meraki Wifi setup that everyone else is more than happy to use) - and uses Wifi when moving to meeting rooms etc.
 His issue is that browser/office365 sessions timeout as he moves from LAN to WLAN or vice versa.
 We use Forcepoint web proxy client on Windows laptops.
 He insists on using Chrome which I'm sure is the cause of his issues as it caches Proxy, DNS and Sockets via chrome://net-internals.
 ​
 He is adamant that he should be able to switch from LAN to WLAN at will and have all sessions continue seamlessly.
 Has anyone managed to implement this? 
 Any tips on how? Any products used?
 (am thinking perhaps always-on-VPN that gives the client a single fixed VPN IP regardless of connection type.....)
 ​
 Thanks for any advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting around 12 hours or so ago, we started seeing a plethora of iOS devices appearing as non-compliant in Azure AD, causing Conditional Access in InTune to fail, and their native mail app would fail to authenticate. Android users are unaffected.
 We cannot find any relevant outages related to Microsoft services. We saw this, but it's not a perfect match for what we're seeing.
 It's still little fuzzy, I'm tired and might not have the details right. A few things seem to fix it.
 - Choose Settings => Mail Accounts => Clark Hill and click on Re-enter Password. This doesn't work for everyone.
 - Oddly enough, some users we can't fix any other way are fixed simply by downloading and logging into Microsoft Authenticator. That's it, you don't need to actually use it for MFA.
 We think the issue might be related to the newest Company portal app version (5.2307.0) failing to pass long registration attributes. Anyone else running into anything like this? I feel like we're actually having two different problems at the same time. This came out of the blue, and I find it hard to believe 'it's just us'.
 Example error from an iOS device attempting to register itself in the Company Portal app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All! 
 I currently am part of a small team of 3 IT people at my company of 400+ staff. My company is currently using Google Workspace as our main identity provider however we also have M365 accounts. We are also using AzureAD for our laptop sign as well as Intune. My IT manager has tasked me with federating our M365 with our Google Workspace accounts which is all fine and well. We have tested this functionality and our staff are succesfully signing into their M365 accounts with Google. However as a result of changing our auth to federation, our test staff are unable to sign into their laptops anymore. 
 I have looked online and have not found any concrete evidence on if it is possible for staff to sign into their laptops (that are bound to Intune) with their Google accounts. Does anyone have expierence with this and know if it is possible or not? If it is, please could you share any resources you have on this. I did discover the Google Credential Provider for Windows (GCPW) during my investigation but have so far have had some strange inconsistencies with it where some of our tests users are able to use it and seeminly log into the enviroment but Intune has not behaved or they haven't been able to login at all. 
 We may fully migrate our identity provider to AzureAD in the future however at this point in time, our small team of 3 people doesn't have capacity for this. We're a fully remote company so we want to make the process to signing into company machines as smooth as possible whilst also reducing security issues (2FA is mandated for our Google Accounts) by reducing the use of passwords as much as possible. 
 Thank you all for your time! I really apprecite it.

 I'm quite the novice in Azure AD (Entra ID my ass) so please, bear with me - my terminology is surely off. 
 So our org disabled the "Stay Signed In" checkbox some time late last year. However I have realized, that people who've chosen this before (in web apps for example) still do not need to re-authenticate, the tokens / cookies still seem to be valid. (Which, in a way, makes sense).
 Now I assume to revoke all sessions for all users could fix this, but is there any way to do this a little less "broad" (as in: find out who this "affected" by this and address only these users)?
 Cheers!

 We have one domain and one forrest, currentlly how its setup is all FSMO roles are on one DC (I know this is not correct). I found this article on FSMO roles and how to move and distribute them to two servers.
 https://theitbros.com/fsmo-roles/#google_vignette 
 My question is for anyone whos' done this
  
Can this be done during normal business hours or should it be done in a maintenance window?
 I'm moving this off the one DC (needs to be retired) to two existing DC's that talk to all of our other DC's in our environment is there any gotchas i should watch out for?
  
​
 Thanks :)

 Azure Boost VMs in preview can achieve up to 200 Gbps networking throughput, marking a significant improvement with a doubling in performance over other existing Azure VMs.
 This improvement in network performance is made possible by a critical component, the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA). MANA is tailored for optimal networking performance tailored specifically for Azure's demands, bringing improved reliability for virtual machines while providing a set of stable forward compatible device drivers for Linux and Windows operating systems. This means the Azure Boost system can expand network bandwidth to facilitate faster and more efficient data transfers and achieve higher network availability and stability.

 So, first time I've seen this in the 15+ years doing this. User came up to me saying that her keyboard is broken ( uh-huh ). Asked her to login. Nope. Clicked on the eye thing to reveal the password. 
 Wow!
 All kind of weird characters. So I plugged in USB keyboard. That kind of worked. Got to the desktop, opened up Notepad, just went across the keyboard. Holy crap, this thing is f**ked!
 Opened up Settings->Keyboard->Install New Language. (English UK)
 Same result.
 No water damage, hasn't been dropped. Next step is maybe swap out the drive?
 Have any of you experienced this?
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'm working on some AV systems with heavy bandwidth usage on many multicast streams (~10gig per stream) and I'm weighing up the benefits and drawbacks of extending the fabric with either switch stacking or just LAGG uplinks in some topology or another. It is my understanding that stacked switches will flood all their multicast traffic between all stack members as they're logically one switch which is a drawback. 
 However, my question is - will links between stack members automatically loadbalance traffic (so 3 x 10gig fibers becomes 30gig link) - or do you need to setup the stack and then put your stack links into a LAGG effectively meaning you have the same limitations of a LAGG when doing a stack i.e. same limit of number of switchports that can participate in the LAGG.
 If they loadbalance automatically, is the load balancing performed via a different method that would make one method more efficient at loadbalancing i.e. layer 2 or layer 3 hashing?
 I'm aware this will vary depending on the chip used in the switch but any info regardless of switch brand & model would be useful, particularly Netgear m4300 range.
 ​
 One additional bonus question whilst I'm at it - is there any difference in the efficiency of loadbalancing when comparing a static LAGG vs dynamic (LACP)? 
 ​
 Many thanks

 I work for an MSP and the load of the moment is monumental, Technical debt coming out of our eyeballs, around 4 major projects going, and many many more "minor" projects. Reports are maddening and the firefighting is non stop. Like a lot of people, I'm feeling really burnt out.
 I've been toying with the idea of getting my Prince2 and moving into project management, as my experience has taught me most PMs don't actually seem to have any real technical knowledge, and it could give me quite an advantage.
 The idea of starting a project, working it, closing it down and just moving on to the next seems quite appealing. I'm aware of the stress of time constraints, but to be honest I'm dealing with tons of those now as the TAM anyway.
 I'm wondering if anyone here as made the move and what their experience has been of going from a tech to a PM working in the tech field?

 I have heard many things about this adapter, but not only bad ones, some in my company are absolutely in love with them, so I bought one for testing. So far it is set up and FW is up to date. But I have this one problem.
 From every computer I have tested, the first connection works within seconds, but if you disconnect and reconnect, I get an "error, try again" on my TV. I don't have to do anything, W10 keeps trying to connect and on its second attempt it works (ca. 15s of waiting). If I cancel when I get the error, and reconnect manually, I get the error again. It only works if i let the laptop reconnect by itself.
 As I said, this only happens if the laptop was already connected once. If I restart the laptop I can repeat the whole thing, susccessful on the first try, error on the second.
 Huh?
 Has anybody experienced this?
 PS: I don't have the adapter on my inhouse wi-fi, it's a direct connection.

 If the GPO is configured with a network path - is the client accessing/downloading the screensaver from this location each time the screen saver is activated?
 Or is there a cache that works in the background somewhere? 
 I suspect its the first option, seen some increase in traffic recently which looks like its linked to a change in the screensaver to a much larger file.

 In the thought there are no stupid questions.... generally, as title says - I'm still having in one location good ol' IBM Blade Center H with plenty HS23 blades. It still does it's job, but support have ended years ago, runs on ESXi 6.7 (that's the newest supported version), some VMs where maybe 2-3 are critical (no cloud possible). My only concern is security - how can I be sure, that old virtual fabric switches are not vulnerable, the firmware is not obsolete, etc.
 What is the reason I should replace this hardware? Let's assume you need to explain this to management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Community,
 regarding nowadays security threats we recently had a discussion about whether clicking a link (for example in an e-mail) once can be even harmful or if there is always a follow up action needed, like providing credentials, clicking another link etc
 From my point of view i would say the clickrate on links in e-mails is very high, but not every "clicker" does follow the actual instructions so when it comes to user training i think it is equally important to focus on the potential scenarios after the webpage has opened, rather to only tell them not to click "any" link in an e-mail
 What are your thoughts about this, and which attack scenarios do exist where you already fell into the actual trap by only clicking (lets imagine, you do have an active o365 session in your webbrowser)
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So historically we've always used mail-enabled security/distribution groups in AD for email groups. With the ongoing shift to Azure AD from AD (currently we're still hybrid) I was wanting to decommission on-prem mail-enabled securiy/dist groups in favour of using the email addresses attached to 365 groups.
 What would be the best way to go about this? For mail-enabled security groups I was hoping to just disable the 'distribution' component of the groups so that they no longer have an email address, and just add that email address as an alias to the relevant 365 group.
 Should 365 groups be used for email groups? Or should I be setting up distribution lists in Azure AD? Anything I should be concerned about in this change?

 Does anyone have any experience with how the migration works with Dropbox or Google Drive? Since it's just really updating the existing profile, all the downloaded files for those apps would still be there. I understand that passwords do not migrate due to new user credentials in the new profile (makes sense) and will have to be re-entered. So, once that is done is Dropbox (for example) smart enough to realize allt he files are there instead of resyncing?
 ​
 On another note, how do apps like Adobe with cloud licensing migrate? OR do they have to be re-registered?
 ​
 Curious on any experience anyone has. AND, if there is a BETTER TOOL than ForensiT we're open to suggestions!

These switches I do not have control of other than unplugging and plugging in cables but over the years the room has become a rats nest due to other people not knowing how to properly manage cables. Including the original installers since it's across 2 racks and using 3-5 meter cables with zero documentation.
 I have to get new computers onto our network (as well as document current computers switch/port) but need to tell our network team which switch and port it's plugged into for them to open the port for that MAC address. Ideally I would like to just use a command line or something simple but thinking of using the wands, however when researching which one to get I saw that some people were having issues using them on managed switches so before I go wasting money thought best to ask the experts.
 For context, I work in a building that has multiple groups all using the same infrastructure and the IT guy for my group with full permission to be in the room, however there are others who also do the IT for their group with same permissions. The network team look after the switches remotely but unless you tell them the specific switch and port they don't want to help, even if you provide them with the MAC address to look up they still want visual confirmation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Due to life changes, I decided to leave a job at a nonprofit that I’ve greatly enjoyed both the job and the purpose of the organization. I’ve been there many years and was the sole IT person for about 100 people. 
 We hired the only person who applied and he seemed underqualified but it could work. I planned my exit to work with him for a couple weeks and bring him up to speed. Something seemed off with him and I just realized today that it seems like he’s just going to use this gig to pad his resume. By itself wouldn’t be a huge concern but he’s planning some massive projects that will cost thousands of dollars that could otherwise be spent on the actual purpose of the org. Meanwhile he’s not considering some specific projects I’ve suggested that had been pushed back due to Covid and other restraints but certain outdated equipment is becoming a liability… just not a sexy project. 
 One project is upgrading the network to 10g when we barely make a dent in our 200mbps internet bandwidth. He’s done no research with staff or historical network usage to justify any of these projects. Unfortunately, no one else in the org understands IT and I’m not sure anyone will question these frivolous upgrades. 
 I’m debating whether or not I should bring this up with my former boss but I don’t want to get into a pissing match. I truly value the organization and the people there and it’s frustrating to see things going this route. 
 My thought would be to bring up my concerns and coach on what questions to ask. Basically why do we need this upgrade? What problem does it solve? And what data to look for as a justification. 
 Thoughts?

 I found a youtube video where someone used a AC Infinity CLOUDLINE T6 fan to vent such a room through an intake register installed in the ceiling. The intake register connects to the fan, in the attic, and then the fan exhausts to the intake of the AC system for the property. Our local HVAC technician told me that it was a bad idea to have hot air running to the property intake when the system was not engaged, (actively cooling). I assumed he was right, but I could use a second opinion. 
 That being the case, I think I need an AC unit devoted to this room. I already have a 6" intake grille installed in the ceiling and a 6" vent installed in the ceiling that I can redirect to a new AC system. Is this what I really need? What AC system can I get for such a small space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have 2 sites that are connected via dark fiber (10 Gig link) , on both sites we are using a Cisco 3850 switch. Dark fiber is being terminated on these switches in both sites.
 The routing is simple with a /30 mask being used and no ip switchport being configured on each dark fiber port on each switch. EIGRP is being used for routing.
 We use Solarwinds to monitor these devices.
 Now the problem is we are suddenly seeing issues on this dark fiber link starting today, was working fine until yesterday (last week there was a fiber cut which caused interruptions but has been working fine until yesterday since the fix). The port keeps flapping randomly every 30 minutes or so. Will go down for a few minutes say like 3 or 10 minutes at a time and will come back up.
 We opened a ticket with Comcast (dark fiber is from Comcast) and they sent someone to check the their equipment. He came checked within 15 minutes and determined it wasn't an issue on their end then got an email from them saying that it could be an issue with sfps/bad jumpers.
 Now upon checking on solarwinds I see a bunch of receive errors today not necessarily coinciding with the flapping but I do see them. It's about 10-18k received errors (only receive) on one of the switches (haven't put the other 3850 switch into monitoring yet) and this was today. Until yesterday the received errors were just 198-200 or so.
 So could this be an sfp issue on this particular port? Could swapping out this 10Gig sfp fix the issue? Or could it be a different issue?
 Thank you.

 For example, if I wanted to run a test of a rate-limit config on a given device and I decided to use iperf, I would need to physically connect a device with at least two NICs (or two different devices) to act as the client and server for the iperf test. The device I run iperf on would then generate the traffic for the test on one NIC and receive the traffic on the other NIC.
 If that's correct, then it would logically follow that people often use servers - or any other computer with multiple NICs - to generate the traffic with their traffic generator of choice (…]]></summary>

 Originally we thought we had a switch go out but now I don't think so u wanna say it's dhcp but when I look on firewall we don't have that many wired devices and wireless are on a separate address range. So what could be interrupting between the second and third switch?

Will A, B, and/or C work?
 
Pros/Cons of each method?
 
One of our customers will have a pair of pfsense firewalls in HA using CARP. Will it be easier to put two L2 ports into an SVI so each firewall gets an uplink directly from our router?

 Edit: some of these firewalls will be in a routed PO. If I’m setting “carrier-delay”, would I need to set it on the PO AND the interfaces associated with the PO?

One of our customers uses a web-based database that has stopped being accessible from their network. We run a Unifi firewall and are using Comcast - and the DB company is using Cloudflare for DNS and proxy. We've disable IDS, bounced the server/firewall/modem etc, and still get the message in the screenshot. However, there is one computer on the network that can access the site - using Chrome on the VMHost. Tried it in internet explorer on the VMHost - no joy. And no joy anywhere else. The database is generally accessible to the whole internet. DB provider swears they are not blocking our public IP. I've switched the DNS forwarder on the DC to use Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) I'm out of ideas, and the inter webs have no information on the source of this block message - I literally cannot find anything in google that tells me the source of it. Any ideas? Here's a link to the screenshot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wqn-1f57tppBIc1823tTakRjj9tv82fi/view?usp=share\_link

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a situation where I have a new Aruba 6000 uplinked to an HP 2610.
 The HP 2610 is a 10/100 (gross I know) and Aruba is gig.
 I added a new VLAN to the 2610 for management (VLAN 50), tagged it on the HP's fiber uplink, then untagged it on the switchport I'm using to uplink to the Aruba 6000.
 The corresponding Aruba switchport is configured as an access port on VLAN 50. 
 As soon as I uplink them together, the HP freaks out and losses internet connectivity across the switch which is on VLAN 1.
 I also tried configuring the Aruba uplink port as a trunk with native vlan 50. 
 If I tag VLAN 50 and untag VLAN 1 on the HP, the switches work fine together. 
 I tested turning on loop-protect on the HP, which did not get triggered during my testing.
 It almost seems as though a broadcast storm is coming from the Aruba when the HP port in configured with an untagged VLAN 50 and connected to Aruba 6000. 
 I've also tried changing switch ports on both switches and changing auto-negotiate. 
 Any thoughts?

So, for orgs using Microsoft 365 E3, to leverage Copilot you'll be doubling your license spend per month per user who gets it. This is an awful price point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Long story short, the place i work for needs me to install a program called VeriAdmin from a company called bioscrypt, that manages fingerprints stores in a fingerprint scanner from the same comapny. The only issue is that Bioscrypt doesnt exist anymore, and after calling the company that absorbed them, i was told that they dont have that software anymore. Checking online, and there are no downloads of this software either (i did find one called secureadmin by the same company but its not the same software sadly)
 Anyways, we have one windows 10 computer where that software is installed and works on, but its due to be retired next week. i've tried to transfer over all the files, including the .dll's and the registry keys from the working computer to a new one, but in the process of being transferred over to a flash drive, it immediatly loses some data, since the exe loses its icon and any information about it in properties. Despite this i try to run it on the new computer and it simply wont run either in compat mode, as administrator etc. 
 I ran procmonitor on the computer where it works and on the newer one to see what could be missing, and apparently, right after trying to QueryNameInfo a DLL thats stored in system32, it fails on the new computer, because on the new computer right after it starts a registry key named "windows error reporting", while on the old one it just continues with opening the HKCU registry key. 
 I checked the DLL and theyre the exact same, with the same permissions, and everything else the same. Im not sure that this is the exact issue with the software, maybe something happens after it runs that DLL that doesnt show up on procmonitor, but if anyone could help me figure this out i would be very grateful. here is a screenshot of the procmonitor logs and i show where it fails (the new pc is on the left, the old one on the right): https://imgur.com/a/pVhHaQC
 again if anyone can help i would greatly appreciate it! thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title asks the question. EVERYONE makes mistakes. The best own up to them and learn from them.
 I once deleted the entire badge reader database of whom was able to access a set of offices. That weekend I had to stay close to the office so I could help people get into the office by re-adding them to the database.
 The 2nd thing I did (LONG ago) was replacing a router and did a command similar to this:
 ip route 172.31.10.0 255.255.255.0 S0/1
 The problem - it was the wrong interface on the router. Should have been:
 ip route 172.31.10.0 255.255.255.0 S0/0
 All Internet traffic failed and while it took me only 5 minutes to realize that there was a problem and find my stupid error. How did I fix it? Swapped the cable from s0/1 to s0/0. I didn't want to take a chance on fixing the configuration and break something else!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audio engineer looking for advice from networking engineer professionals. As the audio more and more relies on IP networks, I find myself seeking for advice from fellow network engineers. This time it is not directly connected to audio, only control of it. 
 I have this mixing console, that can be controlled via lan from iPad app. Although most of console manufacturers let us connect many iPads simultaneously, this particular manufacturer provides access from only one iPad at a time (limited via software), which is very unconventional. Is there a way to bypass this limitation using router? 
 My idea is that multiple iPads connect to router via wifi (wlan). 
 Router acts as a bridge (between wlan and eth) and routes traffic trough eth to mixing console. All outgoing eth traffic should come to console from same IP. 
 Console returns response trough eth to router.
 Router makes the response in to multicast and transmits it over bridged network to wlan for all wifi devices.
 ​
 Does this makes any sense? If so, could someone please get me on track on how to start googling it.
 Thank you!

 How would you go about moving them? 
 The racks wheels are supposed to be rated to handle a full rack load and still work with no issue, so I thought just unhook everything from the other racks wrap up the loose cables lock the rack and start walking. 
 Or should we go through the hassle of undoing all cables, removing everything then reassembling at the new location?

 I posted last night but deleted, needing a rethink of my question.
 I work for a very large government organisation, with several hundred thousand users and specifically oversee Exchange Hybrid and Exchange Online. We have a majority of our users in Exchange Online.
 We have a heap of projects lined up, with a few years worth of jobs. However, they're all 'keep the lights on' jobs - and I'd like to educate and inspire the masses to do more.
 I'd really like to start taking ideas to the business on how to innovate, whether it's with Graph API, Flow, Power Automate, Teams or 3rd Party Addons. Even Outlook feature, or Outlook on the Web. Mobile client features? 
 I'm after some ideas of what people have done in their companies that people have found to have made a difference, or how you've 'inspired' development of 'solutions' using Exchange Online. Do you do training seminars?
 Essentially, I want to provide people with solutions to problems they didn't know they had. I just don't want to keep the lights on - I'd like to do more! (Even if it is with an old behemoth of a platform)
 Cheers!

 At this point, the FQDN of the servers resolve to the correct IPs, but GoDaddy is still the source of the records.
 Next, I changed the Nameservers to the FQDN of the clients servers (same as already in DNS above). After an hour or so, the domain completely disappears from the internet.

 Would it be advisable to run vCenter on a VM inside the existing ESXi host or is this not something we should be doing? If so, why? I'm also thinking here about another hypervisor that we might want to deploy in the future.

DNS server IP is reachable but not by name. No issue at HQ, all DNS names resolve server.domain.local. DNS server logs are clean and it has been rebooted. Rebooting workstations or typing ipconfig/flushdns resolves the issue but only until the next morning when it starts again. Last week when it first started there was a single occurrence at one site. I found some old DNS records on our DNS server from a time when we had a different local subnet in a different building so DNS server had conflicting IP info and I deleted the old records which resolved the issue for 1 week. Now it's back. Could it be a firewall issue? Not making any progress troubleshooting so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use the APCRBC123 battery with my SMT750RMI2U and it just died on me this week. I'm looking to replace it with a third party battery if possible as the APC batteries are over-priced.
 After doing some research I've seen a lot of people suggesting third party batteries for UPS. My model apparently uses a proprietary connector which I have from the old battery pack: https://imgur.com/a/YOWLqmC
 Will I be able to connect 7Ah 12v third party batteries to this? My UPS model supports hot-swap so I'm assuming I connect the third party batteries to the connector and plug-in as normal. I want to be 100% sure so I'm not wasting my time. I've never had to replace a UPS battery until now.
 If I can buy third party batteries what are the best brands (I'm in the U.K), or does this not matter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So one of my customer needed 1 licence Windows server 2022, and we bought him a 16 core 2 pack we checked the licensing and that part is fine
 But after I checked the VM currently installed (yes should've done that first) and I saw that they had 1 extra VM that 'Wasn't legit' they were licensed for 6 Windows server 2019 and they had 7, so I said well the windows server 2022 2 pack will cover the 2019 and the extra 2022, but then I wasn't sure if it would work.
 ​
 So my questions is
 Since licences are usually downgrable
  
Am I fine audit wise with the 2 pack Windows 2022 saying that 1 will be used for the 2019 and one for the 2022
 Do I need if it's possible to separate my 2 pack and downgrade one code to 2019?
 Do I need to upgrade one of my 2019 to 2022 to be legit
  
Thanks

 Edit : every licence is STD there is no Datacenter

For little bit of background: Workload is about 8 vms including a 2019 windows fileserver for mainly CAD related files. We have around 35 Users, all on premise. Budget is tight...
 My plan so far would be: 2* custom build servers ( with 5 year next-day onsite support): 2HE with 8 * hotswap bays Supermicro h12ssl-i mainboard Epyc 7343 cpu with 256gb ram 2* 240 sata ssd for os 5* 3,8tb sata ssd for storage 10gbit dual-port intel nic for cluster/vsan network Those would be around 8500$ each
 Starwind vSAN to replace the MSA and replicate Storage between the nodes.
 Question is this feasible? Use hardware raid 5 ( with a broadcom megaraid 9560-8i) for the local storage or maybe storage spaces instead? Is storage space parity mode still bad ?

 we just set up Windows Hello for Business with Kerberos Cloud trust in our Hybrid Environment.Our Administrators are using two accounts: One without admin privileges and one with admin privileges in EntraID.
 They are logged into their devices with the non-admin account and have setup WHfB with this account on the device and are able to log into portal.office.com with WHfB in a private browser session (for testing to prevent SSO).
 We would like to set up their EntraID admin-accounts with WHfB on the same device, to log into entra.microsoft.com with WHfB - so they can choose with which account they log into the microsoft service - does anybody if and how this is possible?
 Edit: Previously we used Yubikeys: Both accounts are present on the key and the user can choose in the windows security login screen what account should be used for the login.

 Before I joined, it was decided to block all USB keys. When someone wants to recover files, I have to unblock them through our MSP (because I don't have yet control of the AV but that's another story).
 This makes sense to me because USB keys are still a large vector for viruses, however it's taking me at least twice a week to unlock some ports after I checked the key myself on a separate isolated machine.
 I would need your input regarding this. What makes sense to you regarding USB keys : should they be completely blocked, what process do you have in place ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Our company is considering migrating our email and IT tools to Microsoft 365. Currently, we use our own servers for email, but we would like to transfer the domain to Microsoft. Additionally, for certain users, we are purchasing Microsoft 365 Apps for Business licenses, including Office apps, etc. We currently have 35 such users, but during the migration, we will need around 50 users immediately, and within a year, the number may exceed 100 as we expand into international markets (we already have open companies in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Poland, etc.).
 As the company is present in multiple markets, the plan is to have all admin.microsoft processes executed in the main company, while in foreign countries, there will be the option to only add/remove users with licenses.
 For optimal operation, we would require a plan similar to what Microsoft 365 Business Standard offers at €11.70 per license/month. I'm wondering if you have any other suggestions for optimizing the company's operations with this number of users?
 Additional questions:
 What is the management principle for "aliases" on Microsoft servers? Are aliases free?
 In the case of a business relationship, do they provide training for administrators, and do they offer technical support in case of any issues?
 Thank you for your assistance and looking forward to your responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 ​
 I'm a web / mobile developer, and on my current contract, my client ask me to prepare a quite huge setup, in a domain I'm not expert in, let me explain.
 ​
 The constraints of the app are:
 - We need 1 dedidacted server by country we implement the app, with it's own independent database, with a lot of limitation because it's for medical purpose (that's why we need 1 server per country). So each server must have the same version of the back-end.
 - We need to extract some data's from each server to make them anonymous and build worldwide stats, which needs to be accessible for any user.
 For the first point, I was thinking of simply open new VPS on a given country, and just deploy the last stable version of the backend, and link all of them across our DNS. But i'm not sure if it's a good practice to have only 1 DNS server for people who want's to access a server far from the DNS ? Don't really know how does it works actually.
 For the 2nd point, i was thinking about a kind of proxy server, that put itself between the country server and the client, that will collect the anonymous data and store it in a separate database, and then duplicate and sync this server in the cloud to make it available all around the world ?
 ​
 My issues concern the stack i should use to make this kind of setup. My knowledge stop to NGINX, Docker & Node.js to be quick, and that seems to involve more complicated stuff, so if you can point me to some docs and/or softwares that would works for my purpose ?
 ​
 Thanks guys

We used a NAS in the past, but it was slow over the VPN and just wasn't the right solution.
 The problem I've got now is as users add into their shared folders, it saves a copy on my PC, which means I need to upgrade my storage. I'd rather not do that and need to look at an alternative way of doing things with OneDrive.
 One option I looked at was the plugin for our QNAP NAS called Hybrid Backup Sync. Does anyone know if this will do what I need - basically move all of the files from my OneDrive onto the NAS, and then share the folders etc that way (through OneDrive still)? Keeping my PC free of files that only I need etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, PostgreSQL is not very well implemented in working with temporary tables. Even when a temporary table is very small and can be processed exclusively in memory, PostgreSQL creates one or more files for each such table. And this happens even at each TRUNCATE of a temporary table. 
 However, PostgreSQL allows you to create all temporary tables in a separate tablespace, which allows you to move all the files to a separate disk. As a result we have : 
  
A separate disk that has exactly one folder that holds 500K files at all times.
 Of these 500K files, 99% of the files are either empty or less than 16K in size.
 There is constant active creation and deletion of new files.
 Reliability is completely unimportant. At any time you can delete the entire contents of the disk and re-create an empty folder.
  
At the moment we use ext4 file system. Even a simple reading of the list of files in a folder can take 1-2 seconds. When analyzing with the perf utility, a lot of time is spent on ext4_lookup, ext4_create.
 Which file system is best suited for this task ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about to replace a 5 year old Windows 10 Dell Optiplex that was used as a file server for a small business. They are a design firm with 12 employees with ~1.3tb of used storage. This would be my first server replacement and would appreciate some feedback. The existing servers were installed by their previous IT vendor and i'm looking for some recommendations on how to go about this upgrade.
 Their current setup:
  
Domain Controller - Windows Server 2016 (planning to replace after the file server)
 Used for very basic AD functions and DNS. Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.
 File Server - Dell Optiplex, Windows 10, 8gb ram, single 4tb hard drive (NO raid /facepalm)
  
I am looking to replace both machines, starting with the file server. The budget is about $3,000 for each machine. Their are a design firm and use Revvit / Autocad, thus cloud solutions are not viable, they store the projects on the file server and access them in office, beyond that its a very simple setup.
 This is what i'm looking at for the file server:
 Dell PowerEdge R250 / T150 Tower
  
Windows Server Essential 2022
 Intel Xeon E-2334
 16GB / 32GB RAM
 2x 4TB enterprise SSD - Raid 1 for data
 512GB SSD for OS
 10GB network card
  
Does this look ok? Are SSDs overkill for this? I'm thinking of purchasing the basic ram/HD options from Dell and purchasing upgraded ram & hard drives for the items listed above since Dells upgrade prices are pretty significant. I want to set them up for success and considering they are using a consumer Dell PC with Windows 10 for their file server, anything would be an upgrade to their current setup.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several wireless captures taken with my Aircheck G3 that gives me access to capture all of the frames being sent on a channel, including management and control frames.
 I am intending to determine the amount of airtime that beacons are consuming. From the captures, I already know that about 40% of the frames captured are beacons, but I want to determine how much actual airtime this corresponds to.
 I know beacons are transmitted at the slowest mandatory data rate, and I know the frame size. But I don't think the airtime calculation is as simple as the frame size divided by the data rate (with the appropriate unit conversions between bytes and Mbps, of course), because I know the bits can be packed into higher MCS indexes / QAM encodings. (Or, am I thinking about this backwards, whereas a 24 Mbps data rate is the what you get at a fixed MCS / QAM?)
 So, in summary - with access to the PHY and MAC layers from an 802.11 capture, can I calculate airtime consumed for each frame? Or is there not enough info in a frame?
 This is in an 802.11ax network, btw, and I know it can get even more tricky with OFDMA's resource unit allocations, which I don't see any evidence of in the frame dumps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Nokia 7750 SR12 (SROS 21.x), is the bridge-domain feature the correct option to bind multiple L2 interfaces to a single L3 interface (we need to bind multiple VLANs to a subscriber L3 interface). We have tested this with a 7750 w/ older line cards running 14.x, but the commands don’t seem to work on the newer one, and we don’t have a lot of experience with Nokia (we’ve run Ericsson SEOS routers for years). I can’t even figure out how to install a license in 21.x. TYIA, I hope this makes sense.

 I´'m working on the new config and at this moment I´´'m stuck on how to provision all switchs without get kicked on the first one of them.
 Here are some questions I have to solve before start this process because all switchs are far away between them:
  
Is there a best way to start configuring ? from the last switch or start from the first switch connected to my router ?
 Best practices for avoid get kicked and need to be in the place connected over rs232 ?
 I will be configuring the switch over the same port whose will be the trunk port. I need to change the port to trunk and put the new management vlan. Can i do this without being disconnected ? or it's better to stay with mgmt vlan on 1 and then make the change ?

 Bricking printers when CC expires. WTF we need to boycott this company
 My personal experience after running into so many bricked HPs printers many years ago was to put it on a vlan with no internet access. Amazingly those HP printers did not brick themselves. This was many many years ago and they may have changed to where if it can’t phone home it might just auto brick. 
 The only good HP product I used was Nimble and that’s not even an HP product, they just bought them out.

My primary service providers are Hostwinds and DigitalOcean, along with nodes at customer sites. I've been using tinc VPN (https://tinc-vpn.org/) to establish connectivity between these nodes, but I believe that I may be reaching the limits of its scalability. In addition, I want to connect our office network to this cloud network, and tinc is not readily available in most commercial firewall solutions.
 I have been looking into Netmaker which seems promising with its incredible transfer speed but I’m keen to hear your opinions about this. I like ZeroTier which works well despite dynamic IPs but I’m concerned with its speed as I continue to scale up. 
 IPSec is another alternative, but to be honest, I am not sure if this is the right solution either. I suspect someone has done something similar, and if so, I would really appreciate any expertise you could share with me.

 Did "a simple RAM upgrade" on a customers server
 Turns out the server was a ticking time bomb. Some other consulting company had come in there and installed a bunch of garbage on the Hyper-V host directly that was murdering the performance and preventing the VMs from starting on boot.
 I sure do love cleaning up someone else mess!
 DC booted up with a disconnected network adapter and was in safe mode, so no DNS or DHCP for the rest of the network. None of the services on the app servers or SQL would start properly.
 3 hours later the VMs finally finished booting up in a healthy state and got their evening shift able to work.
 Then we had to stay up till 2am working remotely to fix their backups, patch woefully out of date servers, upgrade the RAM of the VMs to fix a nasty paging issue, fixed underlying storage issues, etc etc
 What a mess
 Glad we got the customer in a better state now, but "there's no such thing as a quick 20 minute upgrade on a Friday"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Looking at two options for new network hardware for a customer. Want to add a bit of possibilites on top of just getting internet access. Multiple (tens) of branch offices.
 Solution option 1 is FortiGate on each branch office, and also on HQ. They can then connect them with tunnels and whatnot as use-cases appear. It's a desentralized solution which I do like. Nothing needing user-licensing is also just nice. Possibilites are quite grand.
 Solution option 2 is Cisco Secure Access SASE with Meraki gear. It's a centralized solution, which means all branch traffic is piped through there. I read there's some 250 Mbps limits pr connection, which scares me, and it's a lot "younger" solution (but does that mean it's still immature?). Licensing is ofc worse, being Cisco. It does however bring a very centralized management as it's all centralized.
 Does anybody have good (or bad) experience with this Cisco, Meraki, Umbrella mash-up? Would love to hear your 2 cents. I'm very familiar with Forti, no experience on Meraki.
 The use-case is first and foremost internet connectivity, then adding on some security (web filter etc), and then possibly adding some centralized service from HQ (interconnecting to a partner or publishing a private app or server for instance).

 So we have a quite old machine that runs on our factory floor that has been there for about 30 years. Within the past two months, I have been replacing Cisco 1142APs with 2802Es to great effect. However, this machine, even though it is wired with Cat 5 ethernet is reporting errors between the differing modules. The techs have been replacing the ethernet cables, but still seem to think that the newly placed APs are the cause of this interference/collisions, as these cables tend to be home runs in the ceiling. I currently have the closest 2802E AP set to power level 1 - would turning this down potentially help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Sysadmins,
 I'm sure this is a quarterly question in this forum and I've been reading some other threads as well, but wanted to see if there is anything new out there.
 We are investigating options to move from our DFS servers which are nearing OS EOL and in general they need to be reworked since they were built with 15 year old best practices. We current have multiple DFS servers in different geographical offices that replicate using DFS-R and then we use a software called PeerLock to handle file locking within the replication groups. This has been pretty solid but our initiatives are to move to cloud-based services. Whether it's SharePoint, Azure File Services, Egnyte or something else, that's yet to be determined.
 Some other info - 100% Windows clients, having mobile app access would be a plus, but not a requirement. Whether mapped drive or sync client is fine, we will need our users to rework files since we have an Excel linking problem, sheets linking to sheets, to sheets, to sheets, back to original sheet, and more sheets. Total storage need would be 15 TB initially. We also have folder overrun so we would definitely run into length issues in a SharePoint.
 I'm wondering what folks have turned to as their next version of file services in distributed offices that is as cloud-first as possible and what issues, caveats, or reviews you have.
 Thanks!

 We are currently using the Cisco ASR920 -12CZ for our edge routers with BGP, we just peer with default routes and they've been fine, but end of security support.
 According to Cisco the Catalyst 8200 or 8300 is the successor to this product. We just got a quote for the C8300-1N1S-4T2X as this has 10G ports for future upgrades. It's wildy more expensive then I imagined, 6k euro a piece with 5k support per device (8x5 nbd on-site).
 The 8200(L) series is much more afordable, but no redundant power and the NM supports a single 10G port which seems awkward. Might just go for the cheapest single-gig model and budget for the 10G model when we get there.
 Are there decently priced alternatives without going into UBNT Edgerouter territory with full support?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a small company where our MSP does the more technical admin / domain management processes while I coordinate and handle long-term projects.
 They stated cleaning up the old mailboxes would be a small project, taking their techs about 4 hours. I asked for permission to do it myself and did it in 2 minutes on the exchange admin portal?
 I filtered by shared and deleted the shared mailboxes that I had confirmed staff no longer needed prior to requesting this, and literally checked down a list and deleted them all at once.
 Am I missing something? Was this a 4-hour project?
 Appreciate insight.

 I ran into a problem today that I couldn't use my VPN with Forticlient. After much research I realised that the problem was Windows update KB2693643, which is associated with RSAT. Is there any way to have RSAT and FortiClient running on the same machine without VPN issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding is that using SMS as your 2-factor makes you vulnerable to "SIM swapping" but a hacker in possession would still need both your login and your password. If you've been SIM swapped, you would know it immediately because your phone would stop working. This is a quick alert for you to take action.
 So, they need three (or two if you think about it) things: your SMS, and your login/password. That's not so easy, and if you safeguard both, you should be fine............ right?????? 
 Banks nowadays also don't make it easy for hackers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there. We are running a Exchange 2019 on premise, Users get syncd per AD connect (Hybrid). Users are running Microsoft E3 License. In the last 1-2 months all our users lost their Calendar one by one. As of now, no one has their calendar in teams anymore. We didnt change anything in our config in the last few months. Im a bit at a loss atm and would really appreciate some new input. Things i already did: O365 Support (useless) Mircosoft paid Exchange Server Support(still ongoing, seems equally useless atm.) All the Microsoft threads regarding Teams Calendar troubleshooting. The connection test from Microsoft. Its telling me it cant reach the mailbox. Same in the Teams logs:
 "userPropertiesSettings": { "value": { "mailboxDiscoverableStatus": "Undiscoverable", "autodiscoverSettings": { "ews": { "mailboxStatus": "Undiscoverable" }, "rest": { "mailboxStatus": "Undiscoverable", "mailboxDiscoverabilityError": { "errorCode": "CalendarEventsFetchFailed", "errorMessage": "Could not fetch calendar events from the user exchange mailbox endpoint retuned by AutoDV2.", "exceptionMessage": "Failed to execute Office365 backend request GetCalendarViewRequest_User. Request Method: GET, Response Status Code: Unauthorized, Response Error Code: , Response Error Message: ", "protocolType": "REST" } } }, "exchangeRecipientType": "MailUser"
 I dont know how i can tell Teams how to reach the exchange on premise mailbox.
 Teams is our only affected service. Everything else works perfectly fine. My current thinking: We dont synchronise the Mailbox GUID through Azure AD Connect so Teams thinks the user does not have a mailbox and stops looking. But shouldnt the autodiscover refer the Teams Mailbox inquiry towards our exchange server?
 Would really appreciate some new directions where i can look :(

 Been WFH since March 2020. I work for a huge company within the financial services industry. Having some frustrating/peculiar tech issues. 
 TL,DR: Can't log into my work's system, nor several other sites, like Hulu, from my (secure) WiFi network at home. However, I CAN log into my work's system and Hulu when using my Mobile Hotspot. I had zero issues on Friday, no hiccups. When I went to try both sites yesterday, neither worked. I should (hopefully) be fine using my Hotspot for the day, but obviously I can't/don't want to be using my Hotspot indefinitely. There was a very brief power outage over the weekend in my house (IDK if it affected my whole town or neighborhood, or if it was just my house), but everything came back on within like ~30 seconds. I doubt that had anything to do with it, but IDK. 
 Thoughts? Ideas? Recommendations? Any DIY troubleshooting I can try? I've submitted a support ticket for my work-side, but IDK how much they'll be able to help, since I'm technically still able to access their network from my HotSpot, i.e. I doubt they are the root cause of the issue. Thank you in advance for any feedback or guidance.

And for me, I'm going to retake the networking courses to get some information back, but this time I'm looking for some sort of virtual environment or a website where I can solve problems related to networking( same like cybersecurity websites where they challenge to sort off to hack and find vulnerablities), because where I live there isn't many internship opportunities for students to get hands onn experience... do you guys have any suggestions or advice? Or do you know any good websites that provides this service?

 Unfortunately, the windows server 2016 sometimes is not in reach with ping and other services are technically running on the server, but won't come through to the clients. But remote access is still working.
 Any idea where this problem could come from? Should I restart the AD at another time? The AD is also on prem, in the same subnet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, we are a small organization within a larger organization, and our MSP has filed bankruptcy, and will be shutting down their hosting environment 1st of August.
 We are a small team of 10 people, and the only thing left at the MSP is our file server with Veeam backup and a print server running (with Universal Print connector).
 I was first told that it would be shutting down later this year, so I haven't really prepared anything.
 However, I need to find and setup a new solution within the next two weeks. But what is the best option? We are used to having network drives pinned, and I have no experience with Sharepoint. To my understanding, Sharepoint shouldn't be treated as a file server, but I might be wrong.
 What is the best solution? A local file server with local or online backup? Sharepoint? something else?
 We all have AADJ devices and are running Intune, and we only have around 300 GB data.
 Thanks in advance!

 It's time for the annual inventory of the IT's hardware again.
 I'm in a organization with ~200 users. Since last year more than 50% of it was upgraded into new specs and I didn't took note every time I deployed one (yep, my bad). The previous IT guy used CPU-Z in each of the user's unit then jotted it down then compile it which I think will take a little bit of time. I now wonder if you use any software like Advanced IP Scanner but for the hardware-side monitoring or should I prepare myself to go to each and every one of them users.
 Thank you y'all.

 Now I'd like to set up the storage servers in a failover configuration as well, but I'm unable to get it working. The main problem I'm having is I can't get any shared storage (the iSCSI vhdx) from either of the storage servers showing in the failover cluster manager, so I'm unable to create the new iSCSI Target Cluster role.
 I tried following this guide: https://www.informaticar.net/create-iscsi-target-cluster-on-windows-server-2019/ but keep running into different issues. Either the iSCSI vhdx from the second storage server doesn't show up, or when I add the node to the cluster it says there's no cluster group name etc. 
 Does anyone have experience with this? I find almost all resources about this online are lacking in information.

 We are currently in the process of upgrading our 2012 servers. I am currently working on an old fileserver. 
 The issue is, there is a lot of macros coded to save files to specific folders on this server. I am not myself an expert on this subject of macros so I kindly ask for you assistance.
 When I update the server, will the macros break, or is there any way they will stay working if I can create the new server with exactly the same name? 
 I would have love to shut down this server entirely since I already moved most of it to the cloud, the only reason it's still hanging is because of the macros.

 Any Riverbed Steelconnect peeps about?
 I'm currently migrating an SDWAN away from the legacy Steelconnect platform and have an Azure instance. Before I try to un-deploy I'm wanting to confirm that "un-deploy" will not remove my VNET it is attached to? As I believe this would result in VMs attached to the VNET needing to be re-deployed...
 My gut says no it won't, that would be stupid, but I've seen enough stupid decisions in deployment wizards in my time to want confirmation... :)
 I've looked into the deployment doc and as far as un-deploy goes it just mentions it will kick off a confirmation, but not what the process will actually remove. As I was not the one to deploy, and it was deployed in 2020, I'm not 100% sure whether it created the vNET or not. I can confirm the Enterprise app has "owner" permissions on it however.

 My company is migrating from Trellix ETP to Microsoft ATP/EOP Spam Filter. I have an exchange hybrid instance and all my mailboxes are in the cloud. I've reviewed the documentation below and I'm stumped about what to do with the inbound connector:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/migrate-to-defender-for-office-365-setup?view=o365-worldwide#step-4-configure-enhanced-filtering-for-connectors 
 It says to enable "Enhanced Filtering" on my existing inbound "Partner" ETP connector. That's all well and good if I'm keeping ETP but I'm not. So the connector will stop working when I update my MX records.
 Apparently Exchange Online can just receive external emails without needing an inbound connector? Has anyone dealt with this situation before?
 I'm extremely need to Microsoft ATP/EOP Spam Filter so be gentle ;)
 Thanks in advance.

 ​
 currently i am looking for a solution to shrink a few vhdx-files from fslogix users. i startet with the defaultsize of 30GB and now i wanted to shrink them to 2GB. i have also set the size for new fslogix containers via GPO to 2GB. FYI: I also use FolderRedirect.
 ​
 I tried to shrink the vhdx via the hyperv feature resize-vhd (i also had to shrink the used size of the vhdx via diskpart) . This works when i attach the vhdx via diskpart - i tested it with a skrink from 30GB to 10GB. But when i loged in with that user the VHDX size is still 30GB.
 I copied the vhdx to the right place and also deleted the proxy and cache folder for this user.
 ​
 I also know the solution with frx.exe, but this isn't the best solution for me because of the broken permissions.
 ​
 Does anyone has an idea how i can shrink the vhdx with hyperv so that fslogix show the correct size?
 ​
 This would help me a lot
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was told by a senior network engineer it is not an issue, but I am not convinced and hope to get a second opinion. The issue is we have intermittent very slow connection between a client and a server. It traverses a Palo Alto and a Checkpoint firewall. My layman eyes naturally focussed on the frequent 2-3 RSTs sent in quick succession. What's more, 2 of the RSTs have the same sequence number, and that sequence number was also seen in a FIN/ACK packet just sent, as well as Acked' in another FIN ACK... ie
 ​
 443 -> 696969 [FIN, ACK] Seq=5202 Ack=6666
 696969 -> 443 [FIN, ACK] Seq=6666 Ack=5171
 443 -> 696969 [ACK] Seq=5203 Ack=6667
 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6666
 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6667
 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6666
 ​
 Do you think I am on to something, as in this is clear indication the firewall is messing and/or dropping packets? Even then, I dont understand why the sequence number is reused for both FIN and RST. Any insight is greatly appreciated.
 ​
 EDIT: Forgot to mention, there's load balancers as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have kind of a strange issue:
 I have setup a few site to site IKEv2 IPSec tunnels with a few Cisco router. 
 Settings: SHA512/AES256/DH-group20 for both P1 and P2.
 The tunnel establishes just fine, and everything works as expected (HTTPS/ICMP/TCP etc). Until the timeout is reached and its prepared for a rekey.
 Now with it being an IKEv2 tunnel PFS is only enabled upon the first re-key of the tunnel. Once this rekey happens, TCP traffic seems to stop working. Ping/Traceroute all seem to work fine. 
 I don't understand why PFS is adding that much overhead to the Packet. As if I set the DF bit to clear, the packets are fragmented and TCP connections work fine again. So this is leading me to some kind of MTU/MSS issue.
 I tested a ping from R1-->R2 (without fragmentation) and the most I can get through before PFS is enabled is 1280 bytes, after PFS is enabled the max I can go is 1150 (alot of overhead being added to the pack which is strange). Which is an extremely small size (in my opinion) to set the max TCP-mss to.
 Now im waiting for someone to give me a PCAP of the trouble router to find the optimal MSS/MTU size, hopefully the issue will be more present there. 
 I have a few sites working just fine with just ISAKMP/GRE/IPSEC setup. 
 Sorry I have been troubleshooting this for some time now. Just looking for any advice you can give. Or if anyone has had any similar experiences with IKEv2 and PFS (in p2)? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentlemen,
 Not sure if this is the right place post this. As the title states, I have a interview soon with a fantastic company. I really want this job and I don't want to shit the bed. I am looking for some advice as far as prep work is concerned. I consider myself well spoken and think of my ability to interview not be an issue. I am worried about the technical aspect. Any help on what to brush up on or look out for would be greatly appreciated. Obviously I am aware that this is a very broad question and the interviewer can ask anything.
 Background: Years of IT support with some network admin experience thrown in. I currently have my CCNA, A+, Security + although it has been over a year since the exam.
 To give a little bit about the job posting without revealing too much. They are asking for on preferred qualifications, (experience in that niche field) which I have. CCNA which I have.
 Here is some of the technical listed.
 experience managing data networks with Cisco routers and switches
 experience configuring Cisco network equipment
 Palo Alto firewalls, F5 load balancing, Cisco 9000 series, and Cisco Nexus Platform
 I have been studying all week and brushing up on my CCNA material. But I wanted to come to my fellow reddit goers for any shared network engineer interview experiences that may guide me.
 If I am in the wrong place, Please let me know and I will promptly remove.
 God speed gentlemen.
 ​
 ​
 Edit: ** Wow! I was not expecting all the comments and support. 
 Thanks a lot guys! 
 This certainly has helped me feel better about the interview and the process moving forward. I will take all these ideas into consideration and apply them. 
 Much appreciated!

 What happens to the tagged frame when it enters and leaves an unmanaged switch? 
 The unmanaged switch would then connect to a managed switch before it goes to the router. 
 From an operational standpoint, would this work or does your unmanaged switch trash vlan tags ?

And they are planning on running ISCSI through these switches....
 Like for some reason systems engineers just don't understand how important switches are. I've seen people running low budget switches in data centers and it blows my mind how puzzled they are about the performance issues of their server stack. Like these switches have Like 1MB buffers... good luck dealing with burst flows ..
 Anyways people don't neglect your switches !

UseCases where I would find this incredibly helpful are when there are multiple admins in need to change configurations on a regular basis. This e.g. results in issues when a file was changed to a typo without copying it to a backup location first.
 I’ve thought about using Git but couldn’t really sympathize with the idea because of its complexity.
 How are you tackling the challenge? I figured for 90% of the use cases it would probably be sufficient to only track changes to certain files like .conf,.yml,.rules etc. Maybe there’s even a solution combining this into a linter for YAML, XML etc?

 The problem is we won't really have someone to take over that position and my company won't likely hire someone with the same experience due to cost.. 
 I love to learn but getting certs is not really applicable for me as I can't really retain knowledge without LOTS of practice,BUT studying them still helps.
 My company treats us VERY well and I want to be able to help if this happends. 
 When anything really serious goes down (clients drive gets deleted by an idiot(me and another tech when I was new 2 years ago) tech he worked all weekend to restore the whole server (veeam). Things like that we don't really have a good replacement for tech wise. 
 Where would be a good place to start, to start learning things like this so I could at least be able to help troubleshoot ideas to fix possible large issues? As long as I have basic understanding I can google and get it figured out, but as it stands I don't even have that. 
 Unfortunately this person beyond doesn't have time to train anyone and doesn't do well with dealing with less knowledgeable people as they don't have the nessisary social skills/patients for that, so asking them isn't really an option. 
 Any help will be much appreciated.

 I have begun working in an IT environment using SCCM and it'S super slow. Before I used clonezilla and ansible to clone machines (Basic sysprep image with a few apps then push the others apps as needed).
 With SSDs it was straightforward and fast. A big 100 GB image would take about 20 min to clone, 5 to 10 for sysprep to do it's thing and about 30 min to push the other software we needed (The image had dev environment installed with 40+ programs).
 Out setup was one server directly on the same switch/VLAN to bypass cisco godawful security. We could make our deployment even faster with 10GB Ethernet PCiCards and switch (deployment would then reach 10 min).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a junior sysadmin. In the past I have repackaged some software using the WixToolset.
 A couple of months ago, the maker of ghostscript decided to remove their silent install switch which fucked up our SCCM packages. We can't get rid of ghostscript as it is integrated in a lot of our homemade software and management don't wanna pay for a corporate license.
 From what I can see, ghostscript is just a drop of files. It works flawlessly just compiling the source code and launching it from any location as long as the files and in the good directory.
 So I figured I could use the Wix Toolset to do just that but when I use the heat component which register my components together it just run for days without completing. 
 I am lost. I am NOT a programmer and programming is not my strenght...at all. I can script but thats it. Main sysadmin is pretty desperate to ask me and I might need some help. My approach is probably wrong. I tried but uncompress files (opening the exe with 7zip) and the binaries created from the source code but both do the same thing.
 There is about 600 files and directory combined for Wix to process. It's way more than what I am used to. Maybe thats the problem?
 For now, I used a repackager like Emco and it...kinda works but it's clunky and I don't trust it at all. I had a lot of issues in the past with it but when it works, it works. 
 I borrowed a licence from an a friend but its a one time deal.
 Anyone have an idea how to do this cleanly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow network admins!
 I'm currently trying to figure out the best way to configure the following setup, and I could really use your expertise. I'm in charge of administering two Cisco routers, each equipped with 2 WAN ports and 4 LAN ports. One of the routers serves as the main router in an MPLS network, connected to the corporate network. The backup router connects the corporate network via DMVPN.
 Currently, the LAN is directly connected to both WAN routers, ensuring redundancy through HSRP and IP SLAs. However, we now want to introduce a firewall cluster between the LAN and the WAN, so that the LAN side is protected by the firewalls and the default gateways for the LAN networks reside on the firewall. To achieve this, we plan to establish a transit network between the Cisco routers and the firewall cluster.
 The customer's network are isolated from other customers using VRFs. We are currently utilizing MPBGP with iBGP for the LAN customer networks and OSPF for overlay purposes.
 Here's what we have implemented in the past so far: redundancy through OSPF with corresponding costs and a distribute list to only learn specific networks.
 I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights on how to achieve redundancy for the firewall cluster in the most straightforward manner. Are there any other methods or best practices you could recommend?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 I’m currently managing a large number of cloud and on-premisses servers and am looking for an efficient and secure way to streamline my workflow. I’m particularly interested in a web-accessible system where I can visualize server states (resources, alerts, services, containers, etc.), access them via the web interface using SSH, and add new servers either directly or by installing an agent on the server.
 Moreover, considering security is paramount in our field, I’d highly value any tools that offer two-factor authentication (2FA).
 I’ve explored solutions like Cockpit Project, Webmin/Virtualmin, Rancher,.. but none have all features. While these tools offer several of the features I mentioned, I’d love to hear what you all are using and if there’s something out there that might better align with my needs.
 Could you kindly share your recommendations, experiences, or even potential custom solutions you might have developed? I appreciate any guidance.

 I was upgradeing 2960x switch that was master in a stack. It had two members, and one of the member upgraded successfully but the other one did not. Now when I type in “show switch” it says that one member is in stack but the other is not because of mismatch version. 
 I want to know what can I do to upgrade that switch that has mismatch version? Also, I want to know how can I found out IP address of that switch since the “show switch” only displays MAC address? Can I upgrade that switch just by connecting to it or is it possible to upgrade it only through the master in a stack?
 I dont have much experience in networking so this question may seem like a joke to someone, but I could really use some help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pardon the long post. Asking for recommendations. We’re currently setting up a wireless CCTV network for our small poultry farm that is off-grid. Has around 18 or so buildings for minimizing staff theft and slacking off. It’s a management nightmare, really.
 We would be using starlink as a main line of internet. Now, would it be adviceable to use AP or P2P to extend the wifi range to reach the wireless CCTVs? Each building cluster is like 30-50m apart from the main building where Starlink will be installed. The main building should also have a big screen to see all cctv feed. And should also have night vision. And accessible thru the internet casually
 Hope this gets some attention thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’m fairly new to fiber connections and I’m trying to figure out the right polarity when it comes to chaining multiple fiber connections. Basically I am connecting one switch to multiple patch panels and then to another switch. 
 Both switches will have LC to SC connections (LC at the switch). So basically it goes like this:
 LC (Switch) -> SC (Patch Panel) -> SC (Patch Panel) -> SC (Patch Panel) -> SC (Patch Panel) -> LC (Switch)
 I know its typically A to B connections for transferring and receiving but does it stay the same for the patch panel portion? Or does it repeatedly rotate? So would it be:
 A is left for LC -> A(top of SC) -> Same as previous SC -> Same as previous SC -> Same as previous SC -> B is left of LC.
 OR
 A is left for LC -> B(top of SC) -> A is top of SC -> B is top of SC -> A is top of SC -> B is left for LC

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is against post guidelines but there isn’t really a good Visio related sub on Reddit so this might be my next best option.
 I’m working on an “interactive” office layout that will show employee information based on the office selected by the user. I also had a thought to have a visual representation of departments by area. I’m able to get the individual offices to work as intended but once I create a bigger shape that will encompass all the smaller offices to represent the entire area of the department and then link that “department” shape to data I’m no longer able to select any of the office shapes nested within it.
 I can provide an image that might explain better if needed but essentially think of it as having a network switch diagram. You have each individual port linked to a dataset. However, when you then create the shape for the entire switch and link that to something you can no longer select the port links when published.

Our outage windows are late at night so even paying a consultant is 3 to 4 times the amount it costs to pay a full time employee. Often times you have to hand hold the vendor and teach them the environment. Half the time you end up doing a majority of the work or stranded in meetings with these people sucking up hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've only been managing the network in our organization for a few years now, but a phrase I'm very quickly getting tired of is "it's the network/Wi-Fi." Whenever I hear a vendor, colleague, or end user utter this, the odds are about 8/10 that it's never the case. I can appreciate how end users or even technicians without a good bit of knowledge in this area might reach that conclusion, but what baffles me is when knowledgable IT people come to this conclusion with absolutely no evidence or reason.
 A case in point would be a vendor I recently dealt with, they're very knowledgable in their area and probably have more years IT experience than I've been alive, but then it pivoted to that dreaded phrase. Through the course of troubleshooting, it became clear they had no idea how DHCP worked. Again, I understand how people can have specialized areas of knowledge, but how the fuck can you spend 3 decades supporting networked devices and have no idea how they receive IP addresses!?
 Even beyond that, so many trash apps immediately throw errors like "There's a problem with your Wi-Fi" when in reality, they are experiencing an outage. Sure, that might sound better to the end user, but it's completely wrong and sending them in the direction of troubleshooting something that's working perfectly fine. Are the devs really that lazy and incompetent that they can't try to ping some common external resources to determine that the network is functional? Or shit, at the very least add the word "might" in front of that rather than convey with absolute certainty that your shit app expertly diagnosed that your Wi-Fi is indeed broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working for a small/medium sized business that is growing. And with each bit of growth the needs of the business expand. Often into areas that involve technology. But really, doesn't almost EVERYTHING involve technology now?
 So we've been having a lot of conversations about how and who should take on some of this stuff. I'm doing what I consider traditional IT stuff for them. Business wide systems. Laptops, servers, 365 and similar cloud services, basic support, etc. and I find myself saying this a lot... That isn't "IT." Things like data analysis, or application development, or trainings, or web design.
 And it occurred to me this really depends on how you define IT. I've worked at places where IT is one giant department that handles everything even tangentially related to technology. They are usually bureaucratic behemoths that everyone hates to deal with, but to each their own. And I've worked at places that decentralize this more. The communications department might handle websites, the analytics staff would handle data work, app development department builds apps, and an internal IT department does what I basically do.
 Curious how ya'll personally think about this and what your experience at different jobs has been. Is your IT department the kitchen sink department? Or are there specialized departments that handle different things, and if so, what is the department called that consists of admins and business wide support?

 Some but not all of the clients are making 1 DHCP request every second. Also most of these same clients are roaming to far less optimal APs than they should (5GHz only and load balancing disabled) every 15 to 20 seconds. I’m mainly focusing on the DHCP issue at the moment because the roaming issue comes and goes by the DHCP issue is in every trace. The server that responds is the correct server. Is this possibly a setting on the clients? Has anybody seen anything like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm having an issue with a shortcut I deploy via group policy. Its a shortcut to an exe on a mapped network drive. When the shortcut is executed, the program starts and a login window comes up. Problem is: the login window should be filled out (server address, user, password, database) but is empty. When I double click the exe its working as intended. When I create the shortcut manually (right click on exe > Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)), its working too.
 The software engineer told me the login window stays empty when it has no access to the ini file, which is located in the same folder as the exe. I could verify that, when I rename the ini file and execute the exe, the login window is empty.
 Anyone has an idea why and how to fix this?
 The program was made by a local software engineer, it doesnt need to be installed, but the exe needs Gupta Team Developer installed on the client, its a framework like .NET (I was told).
 Thanks!

 Please I need advise on the below 
 Experiencing a strange issue in my network environment. I have an x2 9500-16x switch in a VSS running as the core switch- Version 16.9.5. So the IP gateways of services are configured on SVIs on this switch. Lately, I started noticing heavy packet loss on pings destined for the SVIs on the switch. Below are my observation so far;
 Packet loss to the switch when running a ping test SSH traffic to the switch is very slow There are no CRC errors on the uplink. Traffic flowing through the switch has no issues. No packet loss to switches connecting to this core switch. No issue with data plane traffic yet. Now, i have looked at the system cpp policy and even increased the cpp-police-data rate to 800pps but didn't help. Am i looking at the right thing here has anyone experienced this issue and how did you manage to resolve it. Please advise

 I was told by a few people that Cisco doesn't actually load balance.

 Cisco appears to claim it can handle it better than the other guy so I don't know. Typically I have found Cisco to be more configurable than most other units. Popular opinion is that I am dead wrong on this one.
 So, Pepwave is out. Cisco might be out. What other quality unit might be able to handle a dual cellular (load balanced) Mexico configuration?
 I can't find a product list for silver-peak, to see which units would have dual cellular.

He has a main desktop that he works off of, and a laptop, but all his files are on the desktop. While hes away, he needs a way to access everything on the desktop so he can continue working as he normally does. He mainly works with Word and Excel.
 I'm pretty alright with tech, so I'm not worried about figuring out how to utilize whatever you all recommend, but the last time I used a remote desktop software was about 10 years ago with teamviewer, and have no clue what people are using these days. I also don't know if that would work if no one is able to use the source computer, which is the case here. He needs full access to his main pc without anyone else's help.
 I also considered just literally downloading his entire harddrive onto a portable drive, and plugging into his laptop so he has all his files, but I'm not sure how big it is, or if this is even the best solution, so I come here asking you all. 
 Please lmk if you have any more questions and any recommendations as to what we should do. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I am aware that this may be a controversial topic that has been discussed before, but some of the existing threads include arguments probably not of relevance any more (e.g., power consumption of first generation NICs) or do not apply in my specific scenario (e.g., no plans to change to 10Gbit/s switching). So here goes:
 We have a NAS (Synology DS1821+) which is used for central data storage via 1Gbit/s LAN to a multitude of users - there is no intent to change this. However, one of our servers needs access to a lot of data being stored on this server, which is why we thought to upgrade to 10Gbit for this single connection (going up to 25Gbit does not seem warranted since we use SATA drives in the NAS). The distance between server and NAS are just a few meters, so we would not need the benefits fiber provides in this area. Costs should be kept as low as reasonable.
 - Would you suggest copper or fiber in this context? 
 - We initially planned to use Mellanox ConnectX-4 on the server, but even off-brand copper SFP+ modules are way more expensive than I thought - on the contrary, the fiber version of synology's NICs are more expensive :D
 - We could also purchase a 10Gbit NIC for the server with RJ45: Do you recommend an Intel version? I have heard that Intel is leaving the networking market (but that may have been just for switches), so I am a little worried about long-term support. There are also versions of Intel NICs from different manufacturers (HP, DELL, etc.)...are these 100% compatible in any server (running Windows Server 2022) or just in servers of that manufacturer?
 Just let me know what you think :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/networking 
 For the past 2 years I've been working as a B2B contractor. I have 7 years overall experience and the certs to go for it (CCNA, CCNP + some Juniper ones too). 
 I'm curious how the B2B market for network engineers looks in the EU looks for you guys. Because to me, this market looks really weird. 
 On the one hand, there seem to be plenty of new positions open. On the other hand, even though I have the "open to work" tag on LinkedIn, I have one or two recruiters reaching out to me. Back during the Covid days, I got between 3-5 offers per week and I didn't even have the "open to work" tag. Even if I apply to positions (EU wide, looking for a digital nomad lifestyle), only 1-in-10 even comeback with an offer and their meaning of hybrid is relocation to their country. 
 What are your thoughts on this ? Bear market ? Is it getting better ? Is this the new normal ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For reasons, in the org I'm at right now, there are approximately 7 domains with 6 being used regularly. Some domains have one way some have two way transitive one has forest relationships. Others have no direct as trust relationships but use a 3rd party tool to effect the trust. 
 It's a 12000 seat org and the domains can loosely described as corp-dev-uat & special-dev-uat
 The members of the 'special' domain include potentially nefarious individuals. Can't elaborate further on that.
 Somehow in a fever dream I imagined it as a resource domain cascading out with appropriate trust relationships so the the nefarious individuals couldn't swim upstream permission or authentication wise. 
 I know it's possible, but it's likely a massive undertaking to do without tying something in knots and breaking it permission wise 
 Off the top of your conical heads what would I find lurking in Pandora's box should this go fwd?
 General issues, I know that you can't speak specifically to this scenarios details

Under the "Configure Ruby Environment" header near the top, I followed the instructions, but when I do the last step of "which ruby", it gives me /usr/bin/ruby, instead of the correct path /opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin/ruby.I also exited the shell session and opened a new one, but it is still showind /usr/bin/ruby (edited)
 This guide walks you through the four parts to set up Chef Workstation on your computer.
 Configure Ruby Environment Set up your chef-repo for storing your cookbooks Set up Chef Credentials Verify Client-to-Server Communication Prerequisites Download and install Chef Workstation A running instance of Chef Infra Server or Hosted Chef Server.
 Also not sure if this is relevant, but when it says to
 echo 'eval "$(chef shell-init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
 I did that, but I noticed my .bashrc is only has eval "$(chef shell-init bash)". Does that mean I did not have a .bashrc file before that command, or at the very least it was an empty file?

I have it set to point to a certain URL, but that URL needs an account signed into it to access it, I've noticed that rebooting will cause it to sign out of that account. Is there a way to have it maintain the account that is logged in even through reboots? Or is it possible to write a PowerShell script that will perform the few clicks, and entering the username/password and signing in. Again I am extremely new to Microsoft kiosk and the support page is awful.

 What I'm thinking I want for the flow is this:
 1. Make Google Workspace email
 2. Assign it a permission level
 3. Have it able to SSO to everything in the toolset via Keycloak and Caddy depending on permission level without needing to invite manually
 This should all be accessible via private VPN and for that I'm eyeballing Netmaker because wireguard go brrrr. 
 As far as I can tell I can use a mix of Workspace, LDAP, Keycloak, and Caddy to achieve a setup like this that allows provisioning permissions easily and SSO and that's what I'm sitting on right now. 
 Anyone got advice? Better practice or setup? Free knowledge?
 My first time having to do this and I'm learning on the fly, give it to be straight if I'm doing stupid shit.
 Thanks. :D

 Eventually the user brings the laptop into the office to get scanned. The SA then goes to our Senior Network Admin and asks what to do with the laptop. Not knowing that there's an antivirus or what antivirus even is. After being informed to log into the computer and start the virus scan he brings the laptop closed back to the SNA again and says "The scan is going to take 6.5 hours it's 1pm, but we leave at 5".
 SNA replies "ok then just check it in the morning" 
 SA "So leave the computer unlocked overnight?!?!?" 
 SNA explains that it'll keep running while it's locked.
 Laptop starts to ring from a teams/zoom call and the SA looks absolutely baffled that the laptop is making noise when it's "off"
 SNA then has to explain that just because a lid is closed doesn't mean the computer is turned all the way off. 
 The SA has a BA in Cyber Security and doesn't know his ass from his head. How someone like this has managed to continue his position is baffling at this point.
 This is really only the tip of the iceberg as he stated he doesn't know what a zip file even does or why we block them just that "they're bad"
 We've attempted to train him, but absolutely nothing has stuck with him. Our manager refuses to get rid of him for the sheer fact that he doesn't want a vacancy in the role.

I have attached the survey email that should have been received. Please fix this ASAP as we can not miss these emails in our work flow and are needed for the weekly reports to the C Suite.
 Sounding kinda serious. Let me stop my youtube watching for a few minutes and look into. Message trace shows a consistent stream of surveys going to both sets of lists and being expanded out. All the titles are the same (Limit of the survey system supposedly, not my department to address). Well that sucks for looking for the email. Pull the message ID from the attached email. Update the search for just the message ID. There we go, much better details... and it shows as delivered to Dept H list and shows that the Dept Head also received the email. Grab the time stamp, ask the end user to confirm if they do or do not have the email from said time in their Outlook. 
 Head of Dept H: NO. You need to FIX THIS NOW!
 Me: Alright, maybe it got accidentally deleted, let me do a discovery search for this email. (The email is right in the inbox as it should be) Alright, I am showing it in your inbox at the time it should have been.
 Head of Dept: You are lying to me. I am going to the VP of IT
 Me: Feel free, but it is there (messaged VP and gave the heads up)
 10 minutes later...
 Head of Dept: ... I found it in my inbox at the time you said while on the phone with your VP. Please close this request.
 VP of IT: Yeah, that was a FAFO moment for them.
 Reminder, your IT department will have the receipts

Present day I am studying for my CCNA while I work my warehouse job that pays well and will give me the schedule I need to study. Now to my question, can anyone assist me in telling me what an entry level networking IT job would look like? I’m familiar with the roles of a Network engineer but that’s far away from where I’m at clearly. Just looking for the peoples word on what an Entry level Networking job would consist of or look like.

I'm having difficulty identifying the specific IP address or user responsible for consuming excessive bandwidth. Despite checking the Wi-Fi controller, there doesn't seem to be significant usage there. There are a few servers that have undergone DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation), but I'm uncertain if any of the publicly accessible IP addresses subjected to DNAT are consuming an excessive amount of bandwidth. Could you recommend the most effective monitoring tool to help me identify the source of this issue?

 I know it’s something you guys deal with all the time and the fix was super simple in the end…but sometimes it’s the little things that are worth celebrating.

 I have some servers out in the field for work that are up and running and I need to schedule some firmware updates on them. I'd like to just use the Lifecycle Controller since it's more automated, but I'm wondering if there's a way to access it without having to reboot the server? Obviously I'll have to reboot once the updates are happening, but I wanted to hop into the LCC first to see what updates are available. I was even thinking if I could see there wasn't any major updates required I could just do some of them manually through iDRAC.
 Hopefully that all makes sense....

I actually had done this on a couple companies already. There was one I mildly entertained because I was interested on what they are offering but then I found a better one...told them I am no longer interested in the most kindest possible way. Few days later started sending multiple emails to my CxOs asking us to reconsider them and that they are emailing me and I'm not replying back? Like...really? Good thing my CxOs informed me right away so I took care of it the best way possible - blocked that Company's domain completely without remorse.

 I had a bit of a weird interaction today at work, I'm a developer and do a lot of DevOps. We have a guy from another team setting up some hardware for us that a load of docker containers will be hosted on. 
 I got chatting to him and he mentioned he had configured several IPs to the MAC address (he called them aliases but I think they're ARP cache settings?). As a more software oriented person, I asked what the advantages were compared to using a reverse proxy and didn't really have an answer. 
 From a configuration basis, are either inherently more secure/stable/expandable? 
 My initial instinct was it was going to create more work than setting up Nginx to handle the routing and ssl rather than doing it on every service, but that's just how I've seen it done before.

 I work in the hospital IT and our staff is using iPads. They carry the iPads with them at all times because they are traveling between patients. 
 I have an issue of people forgetting the passcode of the iPad or locking themselves out, even they are the ones who set it up initially. 
 Very often MDM can’t clear the passcode because the iPad requires Internet connection and they can’t connect to the internet because it’s locked which leads me to have iPad replaced. 
 I tried to configure the iPad as “Shared”, but it doesn’t work for us since Apple requires a shared iPad passcode after authentication via Azure AD lol. 
 The only solution I’m thinking of right now is to set up a passcode for the iPad which is the last 4 or 6 digits for the SN. What you guys think? Any other solutions?

I verified all of my locations all have the same settings on their gateways so I'm at a loss. anyone else experience this issue?

 i should mention this is using Cisco IRS4431 gateway, and connected to CUCM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are going from traditional cisco wifi with 3 on-prem controllers, and enterprise RADIUS (user and certificate auth) to a fresh new meraki deployment.
 The 3 controllers are at 3 different sites, mostly for redundancy and licensing (only 25 licenses per controller).
 Each site is on their own subnet (10.150.1.x, 10.170.1.x, 10.180.1.x, etc) for the secure SSID, and a separate vlan for the guest wifi at each site.
 Going into the meraki deployment with no on site controllers...what is the simplest deployment for performance, security, and management?
 I assume we wouldnt want to do the "Meraki AP assigned" mode, where all clients get a 10.0.0.0/8 address.
 And do you make your wifi network one network? Assume theres no point in making each site its own network.

 Compared to an scenario where the switch supports OSPF, are there any major differences that one should account for?

 Apologies if this is not the right place for this question. I’ve been tasked with finding a way for our floor users to login to shared accounts on the computer with either fingerprint scanners or badge scanners. 
 So in a nutshell, we have many floor PCs in different areas and want to create shared accounts for those areas that only the users designated in that area can login to. We want to use a badge reader or fingerprint scanner to tie the user to a specific shared account which will then login to that shared account when scanned. 
 Does anyone have any input on this, whether it’s possible or not? 
 Thanks in advance!

 The company I work for finally decided we should step away from Outlook for request handling and we get a say (not the final one) in which ticketsystem we will be using. And to use a translated version of a Dutch saying: I can't see the forest through all the trees. (There are too much of them to lose overview).
 The one we choose mustn't break the bank to much, but other than that we are allowed to suggest any ticketing system we feel would suit our needs. However, from what I can tell, most of them offer the same services with the same quality and for comparable prices. So my question to you all is: Which ticketing system do you use and why should or shouldn't we go for that one? One requirement though, it must use/support AzureAD SSO.
 I'd love to go for a big one like Service-Now or Jira, but I think those options will be shot down due to pricing. For reference, we are ±200 employee commercial company with 5 people in IT (not all 5 do support, but they will get an operator account).
 Can't wait to read what you all are using.
 Cheers!

 I recently started a new job and have been tasked with providing my office with a scan to OneDrive solution. Here’s my issue, my coworker implemented brother’s with web scan in a different office but the issue is that after 10-15 users, each user needs to kick the other off to use it. I don’t think that’s scalable unless you plan on buying multiple MFPs for departments. In the past I was using PinPoint Scan with Kyoceras which I really liked.
 The way I see it is I either implement the solution already in place, or make the call to be different with hopefully the other offices following suit.
 Now, I’m no printer guru so I would love to hear what you all use for printing/scanning to the cloud (OneDrive preferred). I’ve spent a few days doing research on just Brother but I’m not finding much besides the web scan feature.
 Thank you!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am after some guidance/advise on implementing OSPF for one of our customers and I'm getting a little confused with the design implementation options. To give some background, we have a customer which has 1 main site and 4 branch sites (5 sites total). Each of those sites has their own VLANs that site on their core switches, and then there is a static default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the firewall. On each firewall there is a VPN to the central site for accessing services etc. The drawback to this implementation is that there is no 'inter-site' routing at the minute and to access another site you need to go out from the central site. 
 With this in mind, I'm looking to implement OSPF but just not sure on how to design this, would all 5 sites sit in area 0, or would the main site be area 0 and the other 4 sites be their own respective areas? As I say, each site has their own core switches which the VLAN interfaces reside on so there are technically 2 x L3 devices (core switches and firewalls) at each site. I plan to use IPsec VPNs for the interconnectivity and utilise VTIs on the tunnel ends. I've tried to read up on this and view example topologies and although I understand the fundamentals of OSPF, I seem to be missing the very basics of a real world deployment!
 Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm trying to achieve a SSO experience for my users and I can't make heads nor tails of the setup and where to look for additional information.
  
All devices are AADJ
 RDS servers is cloud based and runs it's own AD environment
 AD and AAD are synced- Username and passwords are synced ([username@companyname.root](mailto:username@companyname.root) for M365 and login into the RDS server)
 We currently have Cisco Duo Deployed for all users as an MFA solution on the RDS server and it's also de MFA provider for M365.
  
​
 The IT director want's to be able to click on a remote desktop icon and be immediately logged into the RDS server, because he feels that there is currently enough security in place that it's making it hard for users to login to the server. (yep, he said it)
 ​
 I've checked and found the following guide:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-integrate-with-remote-desktop-services
 Which asked the pre-install de Azure proxy, which can be found here:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application
 I've gone through both these guides, but when I then go to the RDWeb page, we still get the login prompt for that user.When trying to login to the server using an .RDP file.
 So maybe I've done something wrong, has anyone deployed this before and had succes?
 So I'm currently a bit lost in the SSO Sauce.
 In short:We have a hybrid environment with an RDS server and alle devices AADJ and we would like to achieve SSO to the RDS using MSTSC from the AADJ devices.
 Can someone point me in te right direction?

edit: added some clarification
 Edit again: formatting (I'm an idiot)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, since a couple of days our Microsoft 365 Defender portal is reporting MS Teams vulnerability CVE-2023-24881 for all computers. We're running the latest Teams version, version 1.6.00.18681, which should no longer have this vulnerability. Has anyone seen this vulnerability listed in their Defender portal as well? 
 BTW, I'm new to Reddit, why can't I upload/add a picture to the post. The Image & Video option is greyed out.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m looking into building my first backup server for a Hyper-V host running Veeam and I have some questions regarding the hardware.
 The host currently uses 1.5Tb of data over 3 VMs but that will increase in the near future to approximately 3Tb over 7 VMs. The backup server will be connected over 10G SFP+ to a Meraki Switch and from there to the Hyper-V host.
 1.) How much disk space does the backup server need?
 2.) Should I use SSDs or HDDs?
 3.) I’m thinking of buying a Synology NAS for this and I’m eyeing the RS1221RP+ 8-bay NAS. Is this a good buy or should I consider something else?
 4.) Is RAID 5 with 4 drives (with space for potential expansion) enough?
 Thank you!

 Setup:
 Computer A needs to use Computer B to access a network share, login with credentials.
 However our systems change the logins (local admin -> that is used to login to the networkshare) every week. 
 If the credentials are used to connect to the share, will the share asks for credentials later on when the localadmin password is changed?
 If yes we fucked.

I'm trying to sync a perforce project with a team in NZ and I'm based in the UK and no matter what connection I try I'm getting a hard sync limit of 2mbps up and down. I've tried two different PC's and two completely seperate internet connections with different providers.
 The port 1666 is forwarded. All firewall rules are set to allow P4V to access. I'm not recieving any network or connection errors, it's just insanely slow. Our sys admin gave me an IP for the US server and this has the same issue, hard limit of 2mbps. I've tried VPNs.
 My p4 info readout is instantaneous implying theres no issue with connecting to the server. Someone has tried using my account in NZ and it was fine so not an account issue.
 Unfortunately Perforce support still haven't replied after a week and our network admin based in NZ isn't too familiar with it but can't see what the issue could be on his side of things. So reaching out to alternative means. Will happily ping someone a tip if they help me fix this as it's really pushing my progress back on the project.
 Cheers!
 Edit: Running Windows 11. Workplace Ethernet connection and two different mobile hotspots have been tried. All yeild a hard sync cap of 2mbps. Zero issues with pulling file lists or connecting to the project in perforce. It's purely file transfer that is experiencing the latency. No Kaspersky

 We have a m365 tenant, we also have a single outlook account that has a few licences o. It and is used for some legacy bits and bobs.
 Should I register them on the consumer account or the m365 account? Having never used Microsoft’s warranty support before I’m reticent to wing it , just looking for some advice from people with experience.

 My question is, on the MSL4048 I'm looking at getting it has an odometer showing 8304. I've tried to find online what this means but no luck - any ideas? Is it the hours that the robot has been in use, or the hours the library has been doing backups (e.g. reading/writing to tape). It does have a power on counter, so it won't be related to that.
 Also has anyone got experience with these libraries - anything to look out for? Well be using it with 2x LTO6 SAS drives. The library is replacing a si gle drive DELL TL1000 which has an LTO6 drive (hence why I'm going with the LTO6 in the MSL4048 so we can continue using all the tapes.

 Weird issue here. The monthly Windows CUs frequently trigger Bitlocker to demand a recovery key on boot. Obviously it thinks something has changed, but nothing has changed other than installing the updates. It only happens on our Dell Precision machines, and it doesn't happen to every one of them, or every time.
 Anyone experienced anything like this?

I missed that and thought, “Hell, everyone’s having a hard time and fighting against each other. Let’s remember bagel day!”
 So I placed a catering order on my own dime. Bagels aren’t that expensive lol. I had it placed to be delivered before I start but when a majority of the people are there.
 I came in and people were super suspicious about the bagels and created their own private detective agency to find the man that ordered these bagels.
 Shows how good the people I work with are since my name was on the boxes lol. Once they figured out we had a good laugh. 
 The only thing that bothered me was, they kept asking “Why?” Why ask? I was just trying to be nice lol. 
 I’m just trying to look out for my users…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some background: The company I work for is fairly small, around 700 people. My job title is technically IT Support Specialist | Mac Admin (I do more sysadmin stuff than I do help desk or T1) Most of the environment is Azure, though we are a Hybrid deployment for reasons that don’t make sense to me. We have 25 ish Macs in the environment mostly Apple Silicon. Our current MDM is Intune and it sucks. We just went through the process of evaluating some MDM solutions for Mac and decided on Jamf. 
 Now, I’m not the most savvy person when it comes to Macs, but I have the most knowledge on the team. Which only makes sense that my boss asked me to do the full integration of Jamf and Apple Business Manager. I’ve started the process, but since we’re hybrid, I’m concerned about certificate pushing and a few other things that are mainly handled by our On-Prem Certificate issuing server. For those who have experience with this, how hard is it to integrate Jamf with a Hybrid environment be Azure only? I want to get this right the first time around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping to be pointed in the right direction for good documentation or design for redundant data center active-active internet edge that meets the following criteria:
  
Large dark fiber WAN with dozens of interconnected branch offices, no direct-to-internet
 All traffic to internet flows through the two (or more) data centers
 Data centers are geographically separated by 20 miles, but are connected by redundant dark fiber
 Active-active design is desired where outbound traffic can be load balanced, but also fail over to support one another
  
Currently the second data center is mostly failover only, with redundant equipment setup as standby or not existing at all in some cases. Capability for stretched layer2 is there via VXLAN/Cisco ACI. The second DC does have its own separate ISP circuits that are using the dark fiber to stretch layer-2 to the first DC in order to utilize it on the internet load balancer.

 I am going into a meeting shortly with a Security firm and they are pushing quite a lot of new tech onto our relatively small company. I am all for further tightening our security but I just want to know from some long term experts if they are pushing enterprise grade solutions onto a small family company. 
  
Less than 100 users
 On-prem AD + Azure AD
 Web based apps utilized, not self hosted
 Sophos EDR + firewall currently used
 By next financial we will retire all servers and push everything cloud based
  
They are pushing:
  
SIEM solution (not against this, but who's going to monitor?) (AT&T’s USM)
 MVS - Managed Vulnerability Scanning (Is this covered with an MDR or not?) (They will provide this)
 Netskope SASE (is this overkill?)
 MDR (SentinelOne) (I would prefer to stick with Sophos solution MDR)
  
Would love some advice here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the behavior of how the baystack/nortel/avaya/extreme system works for vlanning in the following config:
 vlan configcontrol flexible
 vlan port 1 tagging unTagAll
 vlan members 2,3,4,5 1
 vlan ports 1 pvid 2
 This would make port 1 an access port, with vlans 2,3,4,5 on it, and a PVID of 2. But an access port shouldn't really have multiple vlans on it. I've seen configs where this is used as an alternative to untagPVID for VoIP or an inverse of the pvid with tagPVIDOnly.
 It seems like the device on the port would be able to communicate on its PVID vlan, but only be able to receive broadcast from the other vlans. untagall should strip all the 802.1q tags, so i'm not sure what vlan it's supposed to be communicating on. My best assumption is the PVID.
 Does anyone have experience with this?

 One of the published restrictions is you can't change the burned in serial number...but I also know some engineers at Cisco who say they use it in their labs with different serials, so there's got to be some way to modify it very unofficially.
 Has anyone here done that, or know how I would potentially go about it?

 For the last couple months when a device is offline it doesn't return request timed out but instead gives me a reply from an IP that is way different than the scheme we are using. Its not a massive issue as I can quickly recognize an incorrect IP for our network. But it has me very curious as to why this is happening and if its fixable? Nobody in my dept seems to have any idea what I'm talking about. I'm hoping maybe someone here could provide insight. 
 edit: after looking at rule 4 I wanted to also mention that I have tried clearing dns and that his happens whether I'm on site or VPN.

 I'm curious if this is becoming part of a new norm in hiring. Am I wrong for being offended by this? I understand companies have hundreds of applications to sift through, but I feel it's a bit degrading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to help an overseas office troubleshoot an issue. Unfortunately I have very limited information about their environment, and at this point I don't even know where to start. Any thoughts or direction would be so appreciated. 
 Office is located in India. When a users laptop is connected to the wired LAN, no issues. When the same laptop is connected to the wireless network the Network Connection indicator shows no internet, but users can connect and browse, although its slow and Outlook drops connection intermittently. Wireless and Wired are on different subnets. 
 Doing an nslookup on the wired network to msftconnecttest.com gets a reply address based in India. Same nslookup on the wireless network gets a reply address based in Singapore. 
 If we update the host file on the laptop with the local address for msftconnecttest.com, the wireless network shows connected with no browsing issues, so this has to be DNS related, right??
 Again, any thoughts, direction, have you seen this before, even commiserating on this would be so appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of my co workers are convinced that newer model media converters we are using are storing mac addresses like a switch would. Reason for this assumption is we have noticed that if we unplug the device on the media converter and then plug in a second device, the second device will not authenticate, because the switch is still seeing the first mac. The fix for this seems to be power cycling the media converter. Shutting and no shutting the switch interface does not seem to fix it, only power cycling the media converter.
 We actually had a device that was connected and failing mab authentication, but even when the device was removed, we still saw logs populating on the switch saying the device was failing. Personally, I was thinking this could be something with DHCP snooping still holding the mac in the database, or maybe some kind of AAA thing. But I really dont see how a media converter could be holding a mac, unless im wrong. 
 Does this make any sense at all? I was always under the assumption that all media converters are layer 1 devices, and they in no way store any information at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a smaller company (200 endpoints, 20 servers), and are looking to move to InTune/365 for workstation management (and MDM). Seems to make total sense, and we don't have complex management requirements, and we're already licensed for it.
 Our current environment is pretty simple and 'traditional' - machines joined to a domain, a couple simple GPOs, and some third party patching and inventory apps. All Win10, but looking to move to Win11 later this year and next:
 I have a bunch of questions that I'm having a bit of a hard time nailing down and getting conflicting answers:
  
If we enroll a PC, it looks like it still stays on the domain... At that point I guess we just... disable GPOs (and move them into InTune)? I presume InTune should become the single source of truth for management/policies? 
 User Profiles - If we enroll a device and they're still joined to the domain - I presume they keep the existing user profile?
 A user gets a new PC (Win10 or 11) - Should it even be joined to the domain at that point? Is there any value add anymore?
 Virtually all of our apps are web apps - except for a traditional file share (Z: drive) - I know a non-domain machine can still connect to a file share (they would need to manually put in their creds)... Anything to be aware of here? (We want to get rid of this file share, most of our stuff is in sharepoint, but we still have a legacy LOB app requiring it for now - looking to get away from that next year).
 Servers - Can stay on the domain (and probably need to), but what are you all doing for management of servers (eg. patching)? I know Azure has autopatch and a few things, but that seems very... limited in behavior.
  
Anything else we should be aware of? Seems simple from a certain standpoint, but also completely different than what we've been used to doing for 25 years.

 I have a conundrum I can't wrap my head around and I'm not finding too much on the ol' Google that is really helpful. I think what I need isn't going to work, but was hoping someone in here could confirm for me or point me to a guide. 
 I need to extend a VLAN from my data centre to a remote site while keeping the same subnet over VPN. I have a Cisco 5545 ASA at the DC and a FirePower 1010 at the remote office. 
 From some reading, this does not sound possible over an ASA. I have seen others using some routers with L2TPv3 to make this work, even from behind an ASA in some cases. 
 Anyone have any suggestions or ideas or any reading material I can review? Thanks.

 I am trying to find a website which is posting all microsoft news which is attempting to sysadmins.
 I found something simular for developers (its in german: https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/techwiese/default.aspx), but not for sysadmins.
 I found the newsletters (https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/techwiese/newsletter/default.aspx), which are for IT Pros. Thats a start, but I think there have to be a news site for sysadmins from microsoft, or not?
 The goal is to be up to date as a windows sysadmin. The most other news sites are full with unnecessary news, like gaming and other stuff, just to produce content (with no sense).
 Best regards

 When I started in my current role there were next to no protections in place on basically anything to do with IT. I'm going to list the major things I have implemented, could you wonderful people let me know if there's anything missing?
  
Conditional access policy to only allow access from the UK (all our staff are remote working, but UK only)
 Sophos AV on every machine
 Sophos spam filter on every inbox 
 Rebuilt SharePoint environment to manage permissions 
 Only allow use of Microsoft Edge
 Whitelist of which Edge extensions are permitted 
 Web filter to block malicious sites
 Block USB storage devices 
 SSO on everything where possible (and within budget) else 2FA implemented 
 Sophos Firewall in all office sites 
  
I think that about sums it up. 
 What industry standard protections am I missing?
 Thanks!

 I have an Edgerouter ER-X and U6 mesh AP. 
 I want to set up the router for use with digital mixing consoles (sound engineering) such as Yamaha QL etc. and control via the iPad app. 
 I've watched a few videos on the ER-X setup, but most are for creating a home wifi network that is connected to the internet. 
 I am currently connecting to my MBP over Ethernet to port Eth1, I have access to the router on 192.168.1.1 
 I'm not understanding how to setup a WLAN and the U6 as an AP and have the router act as a DHCP server when I plug it in to the console so it is discoverable by the iPad.
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are going to force a group of users to re-register their MFA and push them to use MS Authenticator. Right now my strategy is to do so as below:
 1.) In Azure AD user account, select require re-register multifactor authentication and revoke multifactor authentication sessions. 
 2.) In O365 Admin Portal, sign out of all sessions. (We find we need to do this as the requirement to login and see the MFA registration is taking to long and need the change to be immediate. 
 ​
 Does this make sense? I'm contemplating not doing the revoke multifactor authentication steps as it may be redundant, but I think it makes sense to cover all bases as we want them to re-register MFA completely and authenticate again.

 Ah, the common question that we all get asked the second we have a small moment of downtime. Oh, finally have a moment to catch up on previous projects? Or have a few hours to train a new employee? Or simply having time to catch a breather after putting out fires all week? Fuck you, doesn’t matter because you’re not a boastful, loud-about-his-work schmuck and simply prefer to fix computer issues and keep it pushing to the next. 
 This is exactly my (and a lot of other admins’) gripe when it comes to more customer facing roles. In previous years, my position has been held by 3 people, then 2, then finally just me being the solo admin when i got onboarded. I guess now they’re wondering “hmm why even have an sysadmin at this point?”
 I got my experience that I wanted with this company and it’s about that time I start looking for another job anyways. When I go, they will finally get what they want and have no admin in office. Maybe they’ll see exactly what we “do” then lol.
 Hopefully I can break into a cyber/less customer facing role for this next one.

In that list of accounts, it is showing a domain admin account that has never been used to log into that computer with. I also checked, it's not a local account either. They selected "Restart" and it went into a disk repair and booted fine. They restarted again and the blue screen came back up.
 Since I can't get into the office today, I had them unplug the computer and disconnect it from the network because I'm paranoid.
 But, I'm not quite understanding how it can reference a domain admin account that 1. has never been used to log into that computer with and 2. while the computer is not connected to the network.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am currently doing some self study on a pair on Cisco 2911 routers and trying to get more familiar with establishing a secure VPN between them. As this is mostly covering open standards I am hoping that this is the more appropriate place to ask these questions.
 I am struggling to find answers from Google and have reached out to another network engineer who isn't sure either.
 Once I have configured a secure ISAKMP connection between devices, I am aware that the device then negotiates an appropriate IPsec policy to follow. However going through the system help and exploring available commands, I have noticed that you can define an IPsec transform set without specifying most of the IPsec framework.
 As an example, I have made an IPsec transform set with the following command.
  
crypto ipsec transform-set TEST-TUNNEL esp-3des
  
The only things that have been defined from the IPsec framework from this command is the protocol type (esp) and the confidentiality (3des). I have not defined integrity, authenticity or the diffie-hellman group. Yet the iOS has accepted my command regardless and has created the transform set.
 How does the system make up for half the framework being unconfigured? Does it take it from the existing ISAKMP policy? A system default policy? Just create a tunnel without any of those policies applied or would it be unsuccessful?
 In addition i've seen the command comp-lzs as an option, though iOS does not allow me to create a map exclusively with this alone. From Googling I have seen that it has something to do with compression and should not be used alongside voice or video, though are there any good resources that can explain the lzs algorithm and its application in laymans terms?

I can't seem to find a definitive answer on this, wondering if anyone else has done it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays most of the software tends to have web-interface (which I admit is much better than having crappy client software) but this makes it a burden to keep track of and update certs needed to access these web interfaces.
 Examples of such software - various controllers (unifi, aruba), printers and/or printing software (for example I have YSoft SafeQ). Some of them are on various distributions of linux, some of them are on windows by are ported from linux (i.e. they do not utilize windows certificate manager and it's autorenewal capabilities but rather use a traditional linux way - say tomcat config file that references cert file and key in a folder).
 Over years this becomes especially more important task to solve with the tendency to reduce maximum certificate validity period.
 What are you guys doing there?
  
Do you write custom scripts for each specific service?
 
Do you update these certs manually (once every X month/years or when your monitoring tells you to)
 
Do you completely ignore the need to use certificates and instead use no cert or provided by service self-signed certs?
 
 And if you do automate the renewal (especially interested for the case with onprem Windows CA to linux webservers) - then how are you doing it?

 Looking for a good remote access solutions to PC all within the same LAN. Here's the catch though... none of them can get out to the internet. We have servers that can get out, and the hope is that we can deploy a remote access solution that we would be able to access the machines across the network jumping through the server. Essentially we'd use a solution like TeamViewer to instigate a session to the server, and would want to jump to the deployed machines from there. 
 We have been using Windows remote desktop connection in the interim, however, this isn't a good solution for this use case as the machine gets logged out when disconnecting from the session, making things more difficult on the user. 
 Anyone have any experience in deploying a remote access solution that works just across the LAN? Like I said, opening up the network to allow these machines out to the internet is NOT something we can do in this instance. 
 Thanks sysadmins!

 I called them up yesterday to get a new SSID added to all of our manufacturing sites. This is a real simple thing that didn't require any complex routing or anything, it's basically a secondary guest Wi-Fi, right? No big deal.
 Some fuckknuckle logged into the centralized manager for all the firewalls and apparently clicked push to two of our primary manufacturing sites without paying any attention to what he was doing. This pushed two old configuration files to those sites which overwrote half of the SSIDs that were already in place and vital to our 24/7 manufacturing. You'd think this was easily fixable by rolling back to the previous nights stored config, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We have a customer running a product called Autodesk Vault on an AWS instance (Windows Server 2019). Recently they have been experiencing really poor performance on the software and we've been trying to get to the bottom of it. 
 The software is file storage / BLOB vault with clients connecting to it via a IIS web application layer. The customer has about 3 users on the system so it's not a huge deployment and the vault database is about 150gb (140gb of BLOB and 10gb of database spread across ~ 15 MDF) 
  
The instance is idling most of the time on CPU ( <10% usage)
 It's using less than 40% available memory. I've checked SQL server and it's using about 1/4 of the available 1.4gb shared memory pool
 Network speed tests are very good (as you would expect from AWS)
 Disk activity doesn't appear very high but...
  
Having checked everything with the developers, the problems seemed to be stemming from the database. We've upgraded the storage from "gp2" tier to gp3 and doubled the IOPS and throughput from 900 IOPS / ~250MB/s to 5000 IOPS / 500MB/s.
 Having done all this its running a bit better but not dramatically better. It's not clear though if it is the storage which is the bottleneck or if something else is going on.
 The server currently runs MS SQL Express 2019 but we're nowhere near hitting the memory pool limit and it doesn't appear like its getting thrashed. I just wondered though if there are any other limits/issues which could be causing this version of SQL Server to be causing problems? 
 Does anyone know if upgrading to MS SQL Server Standard 2019 offers any performance benefits over Express for general SQL work loads?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I have a batch pool that gets created from a python function inside function app - and I need some advice, as I am newbie and I feel like I cant find this information, or I don't know where to look.
 My batch account is inside a vnet, and initially my batch pool was created with no network configuration. The nodes ended up in an unusable state everytime because "the batch agent extension provisioning has failed on compute node". I also didnt see the vms being allocated inside any of my subnets, so then I explicitly created it in one of my snets. I did see them allocated in that subnet, but the 'unusable' result was the same. I have no private endpoint for the vms, and the policy of my organization does not allow opening the RDP port publicly, so I cant use RDP to test anything in the vnet. But before configuring the batch to be created in the subnet, I connected to the vm and it seemed like nslookup did find the DNS of the storage account for the batch. However, the resource files are not being downloaded to the VMs from the storage account. The NSGs are already configured and the ports should be fine. Can anyone please give a helping hand?

The common thread I'm seeing is that all are using Logitech wireless keyboards- some via the USB wireless dongle, and others connected via bluetooth. The problem seems to occur most frequently right after booting- after a bit, it appears to go away (possibly associated with logging in).
 Is anyone else seeing similar weird behavior with wireless keyboards after patch Tuesday?

 For example, we have the following VLANs setup : 
 Teacher: Vlan 5 Office Staff: Vlan 6 Smartboard: Vlan 7
 Teacher and Office staff shall have the capability to discover and connect to the smartboard.
 However, under our current configuration, unless their device is also on Vlan 7, the smartboard is not discoverable. 
 Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

 I'm trying to get Hyper-V up and running, though I can't seem to find the correct credentials for "XRDP" when trying to launch Ubuntu.
 I've looked into where I obviously thought they would be, in the Credential Manager. However they don't seem to be working? I've tried every combination, networks set to private, turned off Hello sign in.
 Thing is it says "No Windows Credentials" in the manager? though I'm signed in with a Microsoft account. My user, and pass should work right? Or am I missing something? can I just add my own credentials?
 Any way to bypass if all else fails? This is stumping me so hard.

 I'm currently facing a dilemma and could use some guidance from our sysadmin and fellow Redditors. 
 Our organization business is healthcare. We have a diverse workforce comprising employees, contractors, and a third-party outsourced team of developers who need access to our resources hosted at on-prem data centers. Compromised of mix devices BYOD and Corporate managed. Typically, contractors and 3rd Party outsourcing companies will use their own company-provided devices. However, I'm having trouble deciding on the best solution for secure remote access.
 Legacy VPN and direct IT resources are a definite "hell no" for me, as they seem outdated and potentially risky. I've been researching alternatives solution, namely, Cloud hosted VDIs and ZTNA, but I'm still confused about which option would be the right fit for our organization. when it is appropriate to use each of these solutions.
 I would greatly appreciate your insights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an IT support tech and not a network expert by any stretch, but I know a little more than the basics.
 We have a long building that we essentially consider three buildings in one (A, B, and C) since they are all connected. At the far end of the building is our network closet and throughout the buildings UAPs were installed (2 per building). The two in bldg C went out and I have to trace the cables but I can't figure out where they go and all of the connections on the 8-port switch show the link lights are active (I don't have any network tools yet). I also ran nslookup on the network and it was able to find the IP addresses and names of all the UAPs, so I was at least able to obtain that information for the two UAPs that are down.
 Whoever installed the network left no documentation and the person I replaced passed away. I don't have the login for the Unifi gateway, the router, no cables are labeled, nothing is organized. Anyway, I think the UAPs might run to another switch before going to the switch in the network closet but no one knows where that is located or if that's even how it was done. My other thought is that I think the UAP cables might be punched down on the patch panel.
 Is it normal or common practice to run cables between 200 to 500 ft directly from the UAPs and punch them down on the patch panel as opposed to using network drops? I've never seen a setup like this before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m about two months into running a manufacturing plant with roughly 150 critical endpoints and some odd 200+ which run either on our guest network or a VLAN that’s segmented from everything else.
 I’ve put out the vast majority of the fires that needed immediate addressing and conducted a thorough audit of our hardware, and most of it is at least six years old. A couple of weeks ago I retired a server that had software that was installed in 2012.
 Based on quick and dirty math, we have 33x machines in particular that cost us about $104 an hour of downtime and the machines themselves ship with a LTSC version of Windows 7… 
 This leads to my question. How do I pitch a costly hardware upgrade to the company in such a way that it’s obviously the correct business decision? Potential damage the brand, lost revenue from downtime and bringing us up to code with regards to TPM are already on the list, any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long time since I was a network guy and while I'm 99% I'm sure of the answer here in the interest of security I wanted to run it by some network experts to ensure this is 100% right. The gear is Unifi USW switches and a non-Unifi third party firewall.
 I have a microserver with single physical ethernet port. The parent interface is defined in the 192.168.200.0/24 network. It has a subinterface in the 192.168.220.0/24 network, and that is tagged on VLAN 220. My firewall has VLANs defined to restrict traffic, so I need the parent interface to be assigned to VLAN 200, but I can't do that in the GUI on this server and I am trying not to make changes I may forget about via CLI.
 To manage this, the Unifi switch port has a native network on VLAN 200 assigned, and it is tagged for VLAN 220. That should leave the subinterface traffic unaltered and on VLAN 220, but will add VLAN 200 to the traffic on the parent interface only, correct?
 Put most simply, the switch will pass the physical/parent traffic to the firewall with VLAN 200, but it won't modify the VLAN 220 tagged traffic from the subinterface because that traffic is already tagged. Correct?

 Could someone clarify how a company with ASN AS61317 is able to have netblocks from different RIRs (AFRINIC, ARIN, RIPE) on the same ASN?

 I ask because we'd like to accomplish something similar, but when we made a /22 subnet request to AFRINIC, we were told that we need separate ASNs and netblocks for AFRINIC and RIPE. Is it possible we misunderstood something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a FTTH ISP and we are currently using a Cisco Nexus as our Edge. We are just taking default routes from our upstreams and we have two upstream providers (one 100G and one 40G). Traffic flows out one and back in over both. It works but we are looking to take full BGP tables from both and possible a third.
 We don't really use any advanced router features, just the typical BGP, OSPF, a few static routes, and route maps. We are struggling to find a solution that offers the port speeds we use, can handle the BGP tables, and is cost effective.
 We are primarily a Cisco shop, mostly using secondhand gear. I realize our needs may push us to purchasing something new and that's fine if it is the case.
 I stumbled across the Cisco NCS line and it looks like it might be up our alley. I was mostly interested in something like the 5504 or 5508 so we could grow it as we grow. The licensing has me tripped up a little bit though. I see them secondhand but I'm not so sure I can just buy one and it would work. I guess my main question is do these things require ongoing licensing and if so can I buy one used and purchase a license for it? Or do I need to go through a reseller and purchase one new.
 I'm also open to alternative solutions. Our current Edge router is using 2 100G ports and 4 40G ports. We have quite a few 10G ports on it as well. I've been looking at Juniper's stuff and also considered looking at a whitebox solution such as Edge-Core. If we go with something else I prefer something as close to Cisco CLI as possible. Money is always an issue... we have it but I have to beg to get it. The worst part is going through all of the sales calls with each vendor just to get pricing information so I was hoping to get some solid ideas before I go through all of that.

 already posted in r/fortinet
 we are a msp who offer an all inclusive cloud platform. within this we also deploy and support the on prem stuff from notebooks, switches, access points to firewalls. the endcustomer never touches the networking device (for this post important - the firewall) nor does config changes to it. at the moment we are transfereing from sophos utm to fortinet firewalls. as background info, with sophos we had 0 automation. every firewall was setup completely by hand (a lot of pain and very time consuming). we decided to manage our new fortis with fortianalyzer and fortimanager. all config changes are made on the manager and are pushed from there on to the device.
 we are expecting to migrato over 400 firewalls in the next years, as the sophos utm is going eol in 2026.
 now i wondered how other msps or multi tenant orgs deploy, patch and manage their forti firewalls. we looked into the fortimanager built in template features, but find them to be very limiting. we want to work with meta variables for all customer specific things and built all the other stuff as a standard. about 70% of our firewalls in the field do more or less the same config (some have a few special cases, more or fewer networks etc).
 is the best way to go cli scripts over fortimanager with variables or build an IaC etc…?
 i hope, that i have stated our situation well enough and hope to hear some interesting suggestions.

I finally got my boss to give me another technician and they doubled the amount of machines so no I'm up to 400 machines and have a new technician who's fairly experienced but it doesn't match the workload. The systems run across multiple platforms like Citrix, AWS, and Azure, not to mention they each have their own flavor of windows 10. Just feel like.im drowning and no matter what I do I can't fix them all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started at a new job as IT admin. The IT manager wants me to setup WSUS, it has not been working for some time. It was setup previously but was not troubleshot when it stopped. When I log onto the WSUS server and open the Windows Server Update Services I get "Database error an error occurred when trying to perform a database operation" the only option is copy error or reset server node. Not knowing much about WSUS where do I even start?
 I've found a few related event logs,
 12022 - The Client Web Service is not working
 10022 - The last catalog synchronization attempt was unsuccessful.
 13032 - Many client computers have not reported back to the server in the 
 last 30 days. 39 have been detected so far.
 I've tried restarting services related to WSUS, and I have also followed a few quick fixes that involved restarting the wsus application pool in IIS. 
 Before I get way too deep down this rabbit hole, is there a better solution being used to maintain updates? Preferably free or included software? I am trying to keep this a low cost or free patch management solution.
 Please let me know what other details I can provide. Any help in the right direction would be most appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work from home. Lately I’ve become really frustrated with how much I’ve been slacking off and procrastinating during work hours.
 I’ve noticed that, whenever I have to solve an issue, especially those that take hours or days to solve, I can work nonstop. I'll skip my afternoon snacks, I’ll voluntarily work overtime without pay, etc. The issue occupies my mind 24/7 and I only stop once I’m able to solve it.
 Other times, though, I need to work on planning, documentation and ‘research’ tasks. I know those tasks are important but I keep procrastinating on them. I take much longer to finish than I should. Instead of working on them, I’ll just read books or stare at the screen or browse the Internet. I don’t really know why but I find those kinds of tasks really daunting.
 I did engage in busy work at my former company (in person) but much less often and only when I really had nothing to do. Going to the office is not an option for me because my company is from a different country. I’m considering going to a coworking space but it’s extra money I’d have to pay, plus I would lose a lot of conveniences from WFH.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently work for a company that uses Orion for our network monitoring platform. As a directive from about, we're now looking at another SaaS type network monitoring solution. The solution seems to be far from mainstream (not going to mention by name, but HPE just bought them). There seems to be little information about anybody experience using it, but someone one of our VPs used to work with use it, and so it comes recommended and seems to be what we're going to be using soon. 
 We are a very heavy Grafana shop. The vast majority of our application stack and business process flow monitored with Grafana. It's seemingly the Go To solution for most of our monitoring....except for infrastructure (network/servers). 
 The primary driver to the proposed migration is cost. New vendor says they can save us tons, and we can eliminate Orion and PagerDuty. I'm questioning since we are so heavily using Grafana why we aren't at least considering it for infrastructure, I suggested we at least explore a small POC to see how it would work for what we need. 
 Is there anyone out there using Grafana for their infrastructure monitoring? Horror or success stories? I'm starting to do a bit of research to see if this is a good use case, I see some articles on the topic, but not much from the aspect of 'it's what we use, here's how it works for us'.

 There's currently no patch available, but a few mitigations:
  
Customers who use Microsoft Defender for Office are protected from attachments that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
 
In current attack chains, the use of the Block all Office applications from creating child processes Attack Surface Reduction Rule will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.
 
Organizations who cannot take advantage of these protections can set the FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION registry key to avoid exploitation. Please note that while these registry settings would mitigate exploitation of this issue, it could affect regular functionality for certain use cases related to these applications. Add the following application names to this registry key as values of type REG_DWORD with data 1.:
 
  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION
  
 Excel.exe
 Graph.exe
 MSAccess.exe
 MSPub.exe
 PowerPoint.exe
 Visio.exe
 WinProj.exe
 WinWord.exe
 Wordpad.exe
  
The question is what "certain use cases" the registry entries above could actually affect. Anyone got any insights on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently our remote support network team was assigned to setup redundant network connectivity for the organization. We have the static ip address and the gateway for the ISP`s modem that is on site. they say that it is not possible to setup redundant internet for our company as they dont have the ISP`s vlan details so they aren't able setup the redundant connection. my solution was to create a static route to the second gateway and then add a route cost so that is higher than the other but i was told that it was not possible could someone please explain this to me.
 Edit For more information: Our current setup is 2 Cisco asa 5525X running in high availability They are two different ISPs They are setup to forward all traffic to the gateway if it doesnt match and a Nat rule

 About a year ago I became a manager over the entire Infrastructure team. I asked one of my Network Admins to take me around to all the network closets and ran into this room where we have been experiencing years of mildew problems. I had no clue about this and am shocked that this was the first I was learning about it.
 I spoke to Facilities and they replaced the AC unit last year to try and fix this issue. I have learned that in the past we have experienced outages that were linked back to damage in the patch panel so they had to replace the ports. 
 I would like to clean up this mildew but how? Do I scrubbing with a brush or is it just better to just replace the patch panels? I was thinking this was just a contact issue with the cable but could the cabled be damaged in anyway?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 We're making a transition from a Cisco to an Aruba switch in our core. Just learned that NetFlow is proprietary to Cisco. The Aruba switch supports sFlow but we don't want to just sample packets, we want to log every connection--source and destination, ports, time and number of packets / amount of data transferred. We don't need to keep and store all the data that was transferred, just the connection/header info mentioned above.
 Does anyone know of a good (maybe open-source/free) platform that could provide similar analysis/logging as compared to NetFlow, but based only on gathering mirrored network traffic? We aren't looking for something inline, just need to be able to go back in time and see what traffic flows are associated with a particular IP/host. For reference, we are currently exporting NetFlow data to SolarWinds which provides a webGUI for analysis of the exported data. I was wondering if an IPS like Snort might be able to do this.
 Thanks and best regards!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have a rather strange issue.
 We have an internet service managed by Luminet. It's a ISP managed HSRP via two of their CISCO routers. So two different circuits and they handle the IP failover.
 The two CISCOs are directly connected to each other.
 I have this connected into 2 x HP 2530 Switches on a dedicated VLAN for the WAN connection.
 So CISCO1 ETH0 goes to Switch 1 port 48 and CISCO2 ETH0 goes to Switch 2 port 48
 There is a fibre connection between the two HP switches just carrying the VLAN for the WAN connections. This is done via a HP LACP trunk and STP.
 Each of the HP Switches then has a connection to two internal fibre switches on an LACP Trunk carrying just the Management VLAN only. To allow access for managing the switches etc.
 We then have a port configured on each switch to uplink to our Watchguard HA Firewalls for WAN VLAN
 Basically the issue is when the two ISP WAN connections are connected to the required HP switch port 48 our end it creates a loop and kills the network. If I leave loop protect enabled it will block the port, then unblock, then block and cause issues.
 So essentially it's blocking the link to one of the ISP routers ports that's dedicated for the WAN uplink.
 I have tried putting the WAN ports on a HP Trunk as untagged and still it kills the network ports and then connectivity.
 ​
 I'm running out of ideas currently. Anyone seen this before?

 I thought of doing it this way: Create a universal security group in child.contoso.com and make all target domain controllers members of this group. Create the GPO in child.contoso.com and apply security group filtering to said group.
 Would this work or is there a better way?

 Does anyone have advice on the best route to go?
 Azure files seems like it would work to fulfill the azure requirement, but wouldn't help cross-site to the other location.
 Is storage replica the only other alternative or am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK V2 by Microsoft has introduced a new challenge for Microsoft 365 admins - the need to migrate existing scripts once again. Unlike before, the familiar "select-MgProfile" option for switching to the beta profile is no longer available with SDK V2. Instead, admins must install the beta module separately. Furthermore, the v1.0 and beta modules differ in their cmdlet prefixes.
 One reason administrators have heavily relied on the beta profile is its ability to retrieve all the necessary properties, unlike v1.0 which only retrieves limited properties when executing cmdlets. Consequently, previously migrated scripts from Azure AD now require yet another migration effort. The cycle seems never-ending as we navigate these continuous updates and adapt their scripts accordingly.
 Have you encountered the script migration challenge? Share your experience and insights.

 It maybe a stupid question, but I really want some advice on it
 ​
 Question: If I mirror traffic from a vlan, will all traffic cross different switchs with same vlan can be monitor?
 ​
 consider
  
there are multi switchs and have multi vlans
 truck port connect different switchs (not stacking)
 e.g. 192.168.65.1 send traffic to 192.168.66.1, if I mirror vlan66, can traffic be monitor?
 ​
  
- switch1 have 3 device connected and have different vlan (device1a,2a,3a) (vlan1 device a, vlan2 device a, vlan3 device c)
 - switch2 have 3 device connected and have different vlan (device1b,2b,3c)
 - switch3 have connect switch 1 and 2 with truck port (switch 3 contain the vlan gateway)
 if device 1a communicate with 2a, will mirror port contain related traffic on switch 2 or 3?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our preferred method of patching is to use Qualys' Patch Management module due to their cloud agent being present across all the workstations we issue.
 However, we seem to continuously have this battle with trying to disable or at least prevent the native windows update mechanism from downloading and installing the updates/patches each month.
 We run Windows 10 21H2, our desktop team has attempted to push various GPO settings but with little to no affect.
 Does anyone have any first hand experience of this issue, as well as any suggestions or controls/GPOs we are likely missing to allow us to manage updates and patching predominantly using Qualys scheduled patch jobs?
 Thanks in advance!

We can not ping the urls in question after the host file is in place so whats that tell me? It is working but Edge/Chrome/Firefox is doing something different?

I just recently moved over people from a hosting company to 365 for their email. Everything is working great minus trying to send a scan to someone's email through SMTP through their multifunction printer. I got the SMTP info and plugged it in and nothing happens. There's not even a error. Just to let you know they're using two third party apps. One is called office protect and the other is called proof point which I believe may be the issue but I'm not too sure. Just wanted to put it in there.
 Things that I have done and checked 1. I have made sure that the account that I'm using to send out of has a business basic license and that SMTP is turned on 2. I make sure that I'm using TLS not SSL that's according to Microsoft's official documentation 3. I made the proper connector to allow from partner organization to internal and using their static IP
 If anyone has any information that could help me or at least lead me in the right direction I would be much appreciated.

However, due to our Domain-Administrator account having the same name, after every deployment the Domain-Admin gets locked in AD. The autologon still goes through and everything works, it's just the locking of the Domain-Admin that confuses me. This is my current autologon config:

 If you ask me, "what color is the car" and I tell you, "it is blue", I think that is a fair answer. How would I know you'd expected me to say, "the car is blue, it has tinted windows, it is a GM car, it has custom plates and I think it is a 1992 model". If I were to give an answer like that without specific questions asked I could go on forever describing that car, ultimately giving information that may be unnecessary.
 Am I the only one confused with this feedback or I could be overlooking something. Does it make sense to you folks?

 My group will manage both the servers and the clienst sides, and i'm thinking about the tool stack we'll need, and i would like to begin studying and using Ansible, that's not really used in small companies here in Italy.
 Anyone has real hand-on experience on it? in particular i would like to know if:
 - The reporting features are good or on-par with other tools, e.g. N-able RMM
 - Can be created complex tasks like "initiate a snapshot of the vserver on vmware, only if it's ok then start patching it with preapproved patches"
 - It can reimage a remote pc
 ​
 I know the question can be confused, but i would like to have your insights and general tips and tricks, thank you :)

 I currently use a self signed certificate since the network is isolated from the web, but almost all modern browsers trigger a warning when accessing the server. I found a solution that involves trusting the certificate but it is problematic since many different devices would access this server when connected to the network.
 Another solution was to create a private certificate authority but I want to minimize the changes I would need to do to the network. I haven't found anything else so I'm asking here in case I missed something.

 I read the post and comments to OP's question about "what exactly do you automate".
 Automation is something I've wanted to do for a few weeks but wouldn't sit down long enough to understand it. 
 After reading through comments, and a resource someone mentioned, I went to work. I've already begun learning and applying today and the time saved is insane. I'm still in uni and working at a startup, so you can imagine that I am a bit thrilled. I'm looking forward to optimizing more of my time. 
 I'll be taking two Python courses this year; one being informal by an incredible leader in their field who opted to teach give us a day class on the basics and a formal advanced course in the fall.

 Currently a firewall policy that routes requests to 2 servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I have a quick question. We had a special solution made for an apartment building due to lack of ports, so we took 1 port (port 13) from our layer 3 switch, configured it with 11 vlans and then sent it to a layer 2 switch in the basement of that buildning and distributed the ports to each apartment, 11 in total. Worked fine but now that layer 2 switch died, and we have no good sized replacement for it unless we want to set up an entire layer 3 24 port switch which would be quite expensive. 
 The question is, can I configure 2 (6port) + WAN + Fibre CPEs. Where the first CPE takes Vlans 330,331,332,333,334 on the first 5 ports, then connect the second CPE to port 6, carry over the last 6 vlans, and put them on the 6 ports of the second CPE, in order to chain them, given correct configuration on the CPEs ofc. 
 Hopefully this was explained somewhat comprehensible.

 Prime company hired a new IT guy to support the test team.
 We are on separate teams, he supports one client I support the other.
 Before he was hired I spent months developing both environments. It wasn't complicated. Vm environment with windows 10 vms that have commerical and government software. About 10 vms, some physical, all windows 10.
 I was psyched for his hire, he boasted that he was a VMware sme. He didn't need an instruction on any of the hardware or software. He was a genius... That's fine I consider myself an idiot so of he is smarter than me great it's needed. 
 I tell them all I am taking my wife to lunch and taking the first true lunch since I started. I was working 12 hour shifts before he came. 
 I go to lunch and before our food arrives I get a phone call.
 Gov boss: GET BACK HERE ASAP WE HAVE AN ISSUE Me (calm and collected): okay what's up? Gov: WE NEED TO DROP A FILE ON A VMS DESKTOP Me (annoyed): dude, new guy said he is the smartest vm guy of them all, can't he do it? Gov: HE CANT, HE TRIED, I DONT THINK HE KNOWS ANYTHING!!!
 I am a sub to the prime so I got super nervous, I mean if I don't rush back we could all be in trouble. 
 They are attempting to plug the hardrive with the file into a monitor that is not even attached to the system and can't understand why it's not popping up. I angerly grabbed the hd plugged it into the server attached it to the vm and asked what file they needed.... It was a text file with 1 line of code... They could have fucking hand jammed it... No apologies... That dude was a waste of a hire and this day was just the building block.
 Gov IT tho amiright?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 I have been tasked with putting together a package for an AV company that puts on events. They want to do an ad-hoc network that will support up to 300 wireless clients at a time. The use case is simply to provide public wifi to check emails, browse, social media, etc. The AP/switching/routing portion is pretty easily accomplished. We plan on implementing client isolation, of course, and bandwidth limiting each client to about 2 Mbps. So total throughput really would only need to be 600Mbps if all devices were running full tilt.
 They want to use cellular to connect to WAN, and so my first thought was Cradlepoint. Specifically looking at this one https://cradlepoint.com/product/endpoints/w1850-series/ . The data sheet states that it can do 2 Gbps passthrough... so im assuming this is factoring in download AND upload. But for anyone that actually uses these things.... are you getting ANYWHERE near that speed? I understand that not all devices are created equal... but I have a 5g modem for traveling and it gets around 20Mbps... my cell phone gets around 2.
 This would be in the seattle metro area so coverage from all carriers is excellent in most places. What are your real life experiences with speeds on these things?
