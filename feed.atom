 I would like to change the sharepoint domain name to another one. 
 Example:
 companyB.sharepoint.com(companyA.sharepoint.com to companyB.sharepoint.com
 (both domains are active already in the administration portal) 
 I found some official documentation On how to do it.
 But I'm not aware of the potential impact on a running Microsoft 365 infrastructure.
 Would there be impact?
 Any tips?

 This was my results - anyone know how to solve those that only got F grade? We use Microsoft Defender.

 BEC fake insider protection - Enforced: Grade: A
 Look-a-like protection - Grade: F
 Domain attack protection - Grade: F
 Subdomain attack protection - Grade: F
 ​
 This is their explanation for the failures:
 E7:
 SPF is not enforced.
 Fix: Set email systems to reject email from servers that fail SPF checks.
 DNS Settings for badSPF.com
 DMARC = Not configured (Neutral)
 SPF = Reject all
 [v=spf1 -all]

 [selector = default, v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIB...]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Looking into an issue where we are seeing long authentication times sporadically for certain users. (20~ seconds)
 After analysing packets on client, AP and in DC, it appears the delay is happening on the windows clients (we only have windows clients) In windows event logs there is a significant delay that matches the packet capture.
 After the windows clients receive the server hello, along with certs, server key exchange and cert request, it does not respond for 20 seconds, in this time the AP retransmits the last packet 3 times before client responds.
 This is a common occurrence for some, and rare for others, there are different generations of laptops in the company however we don’t see any correlation there.
 Has anyone experienced this before, I can’t find anything! Are there any windows logs anyone can recommend to narrow down our investigation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys.
 We have a few Dell R720 servers with a PERC H710P Mini Raid controller. We bought a few Samsung 1643a SAS SSD drives that we would like to use to extend the life of these old servers a bit.
 When installing the drives, they were properly recognized, they show up in IDRAC. I set up a new Virtual Disk, configured the RAID array, did a fast initialization (as the drives were brand new), everything went smoothly.
 However, on reboot, it took a very long time for the server to start, and it stops at the PERC initialization with the message "Adapter at Baseport is not responding. No adapter" and fails to continue to boot.
 Removing the drives, the adapter is initialized and the machine boots.
 I also tried adding the drives while I was in the BIOS RAID utility, and it's the same, as via IDRAC. The drives get recognized, RAID array configuration works, but upon reboot, it stops with the same error message.
 Before the error message pops up, the drives' LEDs blink slowly, sequentially (one after the other). After a few minutes, they all blink fast. I let it be for a few hours, but did not change the results.
 Here are some other things I tried already:
  
firmware/bios update - everything is up to date
 only connected 1/2/4/6 drives at a time
 removed other drives in the enclosure
 perform a full initialization of the raid array from the BIOS RAID utility
 opened up the server and checked the cables, battery, reseated the adapter
 used another identical server
  
Any idea of what might be wrong?
 Anyone else use this combo R720/H710P/1643a?
 Thanks a bunch!

 I'm aware that services exist to deal with spam etc like Mimecast, Proofpoint. But for a small company like ours, it seems a bit OTT.
  
 The issue I have is the methods provided in the M365 estate either don't seem to work very well or are patchy.
  
In transport rules I have tried specific email, targeted words, domain blocks etc
 In Configuration Analyser we are set to strict
 Anti- Phish/Spam/Malware all on + Safe Links and Attachments
  
All the usual things I guess are on or active.
 Even tried blocking within the Phish and Spam settings
 But stuff just seems to be able to evade it?
 If I set an alert for e.g. on an incoming email I have blocked I might get a couple, and then I find it in the quarantine again the next day.
  
 Currently, I have to view the quarantine every day and delete anything suspect. Even for a small company like us, it's 100 a day +. But we find this is too quick for the users sometimes and stuff they need gets removed. 
 We did wonder if there is a script or something to delete them over "x" days to save my time going every day?
 We tell them to use the Block /Allow emails and add them to their contacts, but I doubt many do
  
 We did also wonder about allowing stuff to be active in the quarantine so they moderate and release their own stuff, dunno how safe that will be though.
  
 How are we actually supposed to keep this stuff out?
 I know everyone has a method, but what is the correct way to keep this stuff blocked?
 Or the correct sections to use that will help.
  
 Or is there no answer?

 Then i get the quota .. last year the renewal of same edition was 336$ for 1 Year, now it's 999$ a Year
 "3 Year Subscription — $999.00 Paid Annually " and in checkout "Renewal 3 Year Subscription, Price Per Year"
 I've sent their sales team an email if this can be correct price for 1 year...
 the change from 1 year normal renewal to 3 year contract is pretty bad, but if the price jump is real...
 Cancel maintenance, let it run for a few months before i setup a new ftp server.
 Good weekend everybody!

 Either the PC won't turn on, or functionality is limited. The current solution to this is power resetting the PC every time. 
 Any idea if this is caused by a recent Windows/Firmware update?

 We have a Dell Latitude 5530 that had its motherboard replaced 2-3 months ago due to graphical issues when plugged into a dock (WD19S) - this is a somewhat ongoing issue but is separate.
 Starting today, the laptop has refused to power on unless it is plugged into a Dell Dock.The laptop doesn't power on, or show any sign of life, when disconnected from all devices or plugged into a power adapter/charger.I've tried a few chargers that all work without issues on other devices, so it's definitely not a charger issue.
 If you boot up the laptop whilst plugged into the dock, and then unplug, it works seamlessly, as if there were no issues at all. Restarting the device when unplugged is completely fine, it's just shutting down/booting up
 Is this something anyone has experienced before, or has any basic troubleshooting steps I could look at as a starting point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out how to best setup a wireless mesh network network that utilizes multiple gateways in order to minimize the amount of hops needed to reach WAN.
 Say we have a very long linear mesh (bunch of nodes on a string) in a tunnel. For each hop we loose some throughput, so if we only have one router as the gateway at say one of the ends, at the other end we will have much decreased performance. I could setup the mesh such that the nodes at the first third will use router A as the gateway, the next third uses router B and the last third uses router C. This works fine, except we of course get dropped connections every time we roam from one third to another and the routers don't act as a failover for each other. Additionally, the roaming is slower when effectively switching between networks.
 One topology I've thought about it having each of routers A,B and C use another fourth router D as their gateway such that then at least at the connections come from the same place and then perhaps it would be possible to perhaps have a stable phone call throughout the tunnel when roaming.
 Problem is that I'm frankly a little too green to figure this out entirely on my own. I guess what I'm looking for is called multi-WAN or multi-home? What sort of topology and/or setups would you use in this situation?

 I remember reading about research comparing different information security tools, but my google fu is failing me and I get mostly corporate spam stuff. I remember seeing comparisons between training and training plus testing and how both combined are much more effective than either in their own. I did find a cambrige paper about cost-effectiveness across threat vectors and industries, but not about countermeasures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reaching out to seek your expertise and assistance with a task I'm currently working on. I have a text file containing log lines, and I need to scan these lines for specific destination IP addresses and extract certain fields from them.
 The IPs I want to scan the lines for are around 50, so I need to feed the script these 50 IP addresses as IP1, IP2, and so on.
 The field for destination IP is dst_ip in the log below and the same line has protocol, and dst_port fields.
 And then extract the fields highlighted below: dst_ip, protocol, and dst_port
 I would prefer if this can be done in CMD with a batch file on windows, as my experience with python scripting and so on is very beginner level, but I am open to try out suggestions.
 Here's a log snippet:
 device="SFW" date=2023-06-21 time=09:41:51 timezone="AEST" device_name="XG310" device_id=C30055Q2CVGH6FC log_id=010202601001 log_type="Firewall" log_component="Invalid Traffic" log_subtype="Denied" status="Deny" priority=Information duration=0 fw_rule_id=0 policy_type=0 user_name="" user_gp="" iap=0 ips_policy_id=0 appfilter_policy_id=0 application="" application_risk=0 application_technology="" application_category="" in_interface="Port4" out_interface="" src_mac=34:0a:98:30:4b:91 src_ip=10.1.2.3 src_country_code= **dst_ip=10.3.2.1** dst_country_code= **protocol="TCP"** src_port=80 **dst_port=1433** sent_pkts=0 recv_pkts=0 sent_bytes=0 recv_bytes=0 tran_src_ip= tran_src_port=0 tran_dst_ip= tran_dst_port=0 srczonetype="" srczone="" dstzonetype="" dstzone="" dir_disp="" connid="" vconnid="" hb_health="No Heartbeat" message="Could not associate packet to any connection." appresolvedby="Signature" app_is_cloud=0
 I tried various ways in notepad++ but could not meet these requirements, I believe this can be done much fasted in a batch script or python script.

 we are working in hybrid exchange environment and our mails get scanned by Microsoft 365 Defender. Since I am the "mail guy" I have to say that Defender Quarantine options are limited and that is why I am asking the sysadmin community to help me out in recommending an additional product or software which can deliver more granularity and control over how spam e-mail is handled. 
 On to the explanations:
  
I just want to be able to block certain senders, block certain swear words from EVER reaching the quarantine. I dont want to blacklist e-mails so they do eventually land in quarantine, I want to delete them.
 Please do not mention transport rules, yes they do exist but I would like to move away from Microsoft in this case.
 The product should not cost a bazillion € since we are a small company, I am not searching for free, but also some high end enterprise solution is out of our scope.
 The product should support integration with O365 and should be in the cloud.
  
Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making this post on the off chance anyone experiences what I did. Because it was a huge pain and I found no resources online, plus Lenovo’s premium tech support couldn’t help over the phone.
 Long story short: Borked Windows install on tower and wanted to run an official recovery install rather than a clean one. Recovery Creator was failing to create the installer USB drive.
 Steps initially taken:
  
 Placed online digital order for recovery
  Inserted a flash drive
  Downloaded Lenovo USB Recovery Creator and ran it
  Signed in and selected my digital order
  Let it download the media
  Allowed it to attempt to create the USB recovery key
  
At this point it failed, with a number of errors mentioning that it could no longer find the flash drive and that it failed at partitioning the drive.
 Checked disk management and found it had created a RAW 32GB partition and left the rest of the space unallocated. Looked like it failed after that initial partitioning, right before formatting.
 What it took to get it to work:
 Disk management failed every time I tried to manually repartition or in any way ‘fix’ the USB drive.
 I had to use diskpart, select the disk, clean it, create partition primary. After this I was able to successfully modify the drive through disk management again.
 Some more testing and I discovered you basically have to manually create the 32GB FAT32 partition on a flash drive and most importantly, assign it a letter. Make sure to leave the rest of the drive space unallocated. Then use the recovery creator to actually write the media and create the recovery USB.
 Don’t manually create and format the partition? The recovery creator will try to do it itself and fail. Messing up your flash drive and requiring diskpart to fix.
 Don’t assign a drive letter after partitioning and formatting? Recovery creator will simply fail.
 Best of luck to anyone who may come across this in their time of need.

 On my infra, we switched to simple network access to link aggregates (bonding) and vlan trunking on the bond interfaces, I mean server side. 
 Nothing exotic. But since then we noticed with wireshark a lot of TCP issues : out of order, dup ack and retransmission 
 I first thought that routing was messy but I tested with tcp traceroute everywhere and I saw nothing wrong.
 I thought about MTU but it seems ok (tested with ping with 1500 size and no fragmentation).
 I’m not a networking guy, I work on a bare metal kubernetes infra. The networking team says that there is nothing wrong on switches/routers at first sight. 
 These errors appears even on same LAN connections. 
 Where would you look at to debug this ?

 I read and reread this article a few times and I don't see what I did wrong there.
 Previously I had a connector set up but after I read "Doesn't work with a connector; never configure a device to use a connector with direct send because such a configuration can cause problems." I removed the printers public IP from the connector.
 What happens is that for some devices only every third or so scan is successfully send while all other scan jobs produce an NG 313 error code (A communication error has occurred.)
  
SPF record is there
 Printer are NATed to the same public IP which is white-listed (https://i.imgur.com/DsGZuEK.png)
 Tried TLS/StartTLS and without, didn't notice a difference
 Got a packet capture but I really could not find any smoking gun here
  
Is direct send in general prone to problems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’m not really a system administrator but need some advice regarding a potential solution that could work for an office with about 5 network drives. Each of these drives is chock full of data with a very well maintained and organized folder structure/hierarchy.
 Unfortunately, data is organized by project number (and not labeled in any way that’s clear), so it makes it difficult for people to get acquainted and find files for the projects they’re working on. Additionally, since there are so many nested directories, it can take clicking through multiple levels before realizing whether you’re in the right directory to start with.
 Is there a good, ready/easy to deploy system that can create a clean searchable directory of directories and file paths? I’m imaging something where the project number or project name could be entered, and then all various paths relating to the project could show up with labels to make it clear (i.e., Floor Plans: P:/00-1020202-22/Ar/FP/, Mechanical: P:/General Resources/MechanicalCAD/).
 Thanks in advance for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to a new company which is trying to deploy Openstack with Cisco ACI, since I am the one with the most experience with Openstack. Deployed it a number of times before but never with ACI.
 The problem here is that I kept getting You have held Broken Packages. whenever I try to integrate Openstack with ACI, specifically the neutron-aci-opflex plugin. All other components are already working and ready including the neutron-api-plugin-aci.
 Perhaps I am missing something? Cisco support is not really helpful here, so I am looking at the community right now.
 To everyone who have a Cisco ACI infra, How many of you guys successfully did this? What’s your process? Currently using juju for this, since it’s the only opensource deployment supported by Cisco.
 (please don’t mention vendors support like Redhat\Canonical, we are already looking at it, please instead tell your story or experience working with this kind of setup)

the port for Call Home i.e, 4334
 the port required for NETCONF one of which could be 7022

 Is netopeer much different in that regard? It's just I can't seem to set up communication with the client

 I am learning how to write scripts to make work easier. But at my current stage I constantly find myself relying heavily on the Microsoft docs. Like if they have an example of updating a user in AD then I will use their code as a base and customize as needed (after a couple of hours reading about how to use the parameters). When did you become confident in your ability to write scripts as a sysadmin? I'm a CS major, husband, father, working full time. I feel like my progress is super slow, because I have been trying to learn this role and balance personal responsibility. Any insight would.be greatly appreciated.

We use Proofpoint for spam filters, but those logs only go back 30 days. We also have another on-premise mail archiver. We found the email in that archiver and were able to extract it, and then forward it to the boss.
 He then asks us "Why didn't I get this email on the day it was sent?" Well it was in the archives, so it must have gone into the mailbox. But boss was claiming he never saw it so did not believe me when I was explaining that it was delivered on XYZ date.
 Not really sure now to handle this situation. I explained we found it and recovered it from his mailbox, but I could not say why he "never received it"

We had eduroam many many years ago, just when I started working here, so not that familiar with it. The people who were around that time are no longer here so I’m not sure why we moved away from it. From what I’ve read it looks like 3rd party wireless hosting. Being the only network guy that sounds great as it may relieve a lot of responsibilities but I’ve been around long enough to know not to trust my initial instincts lol. 
 So what are your thoughts on it as far as cost, features, ease of use, fit, etc. ? We currently use clearpass w Aruba controllers and APs. We average around 1200-1500 wireless users. Mainly we provide public/unsecure and staff-only access (read: nothing fancy).

Typical complaints, micromanagement, mandatory overtime, off the clock work, and lots of comp-time that never seems to actually get burned. So I've been poking around looking for a new job while I finish my Graduate and I'm thinking about going part time to manage the workload.
 Several times I've been approached on Indeed or LinkedIn by various recruiters. The pitch is always the same. "Hey we think youd be great for this InfoSec position/DB manager, it's full time but fully remote and there's no set schedule so you can work around school." There's then 2-3 calls with someone who helps me polish my resume for the position and once I even had 3 calls with the rep and her manager to make sure I was a good fit. Then the second my resume is all dialed in BOOM! "Sorry, but they just filled that position. Would you happen to be interested on their overnight part time housekeeper position though? It pays a whopping $12/hr!"
 I'm not even sure if it's incompetent recruiters, incommunicative clients, or just a straight up scam to steal my personal information or something. All I know is it's getting old.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working through a plan to replace some core network switches in our datacenter and wanted to solicit some advice from the community here. 
 We have three sites in a ring (more like a triangle) topology and run EIGRP as our routing protocol. Each site has a pair of core switches that handle the intersite connections. Site A connects to site B via 2x1Gb links currently in a L3 Portchannel. Site B to Site C is single 1Gb and site C back to site A is single 1Gb link (all those using L2 connection with SVI's). Site B is getting an upgrade to Nexus cores so we will no longer be able to run a L3 PC with VPC back to Site A.
 I am curious what you guys would do with this topology. I am contemplating running routed links everywhere like this. Will EIGRP ECMP this traffic and utilize both paths by default or is their additional configuration that needs to be done? Any other pros/cons to this design?
 Another option I am tossing around is doing a simple L2-VPC and running SVI at both ends like this.
 I would love to hear your thoughts and talk through the different solutions here. Thanks in advance.

 Been tracking down an intermediate email delivery issue for the better part of a month, only to find out our gateway has blacklisted the entire AWS IP range. So any website using Amazon SES to send emails will never get delivered to our domain.
 Guess what our main website uses to send web form submissions.
 Apparently ‘cuda relies on SpamCop for its lists which you guessed it, blocks the entire AWS range.
 I originally requested a bounce back report from our website builder, who maintained that there was no issue they could see, until I pushed back last week to run a bounce back report, sure enough, 290 emails since late may were never delivered.
 Imagine spinning in circles getting this figured out with 3 vendors (host, dev, barracuda) telling me they couldn’t figure it out.
 I think I’m more surprised that no one else has reported this via Google results.

They downloaded an app on their phone to show where all the microphones and cameras are hiding in their house and office to record them . When I pointed out that there was nothing on the wall where the app said there was a camera, they said it must be to small to see. They know someone was in their house because they were missing their sunglasses at home, and the glasses were on their work desk when they got to work. So the "hacker" also has keys to his house and our office, supposedly. They reloaded their personal laptop and then said that the BIOS is hacked because it created an X drive while reloading. His work computer is hacked because there are updates with all capital names, and some without, and that's not how Microsoft would push out updates. Email that takes longer then a few second to receive from their personal account to their work account is because they are being intercepted, edited, and then delivered.
 Once a week I get emails with walls of text and screen shots, wanting to know things like why does the All users folder look exactly like the Program Data folder?
 Currently, they are pulling up the dev console on any financial sites (They work in accounting) and saying that the java script does not look right. I told them to make a report with the financial institutions and let them know their concerns.
 Has anyone else had to deal with people ill like this at work? What is the best course of action that you have found? I talked with HR and my supervisor, but neither acted like it was a pressing concern and suggested I ignore their emails.

I recently got sec+, a secret clearance and just 3 months of help desk technician experience from the AF. I’ve never been a contractor nor have I ever had a big adult job like this before. Just wondering if there are better places to start or if I should shoot higher? Not sure about taking the job atp in time.
 Update: what I’ve gathered from the comments is that I should take the job for experience/resume purposes, stay for at LEAST 6 months, get a job that requires me to keep my clearance and just go up from there

 I made some 'not so critical but important to know' change on customer network and things did not get as my expectations.
 So the edge topology consist of 2x Switch and 2x router redundancy. Switches trunked for all VLAN's.
 They use seperate eBGP on both routers for both ISP's. One of the ISP's use different IP's but other one use same IP and story begins here.
 Since this ISP making two BGP with same IP but customer side is L2 neighbor, the switch buffers populated with whole MAC flap logs.
 Safety alert, this ISP is secondary for both download and upload.
 Since i saw the switch CPU load that connected to primary router for iBGP VRRP, my first assumption was these L2 flaps because the MATM process consuming %30 CPU (totaly CPU load was %60-65) and this can be easly fixed with …]]></summary>

 Everything at Site B is routed to Site A. ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.255.254.4 (core sw at site A)

 Clients are getting dhcp, and can ping internal 10.x.x.x devices (will setup an ACL for security later after this is working). Can ping dns servers.
 172.16.9.x guests however cannot get to internet.

I think it might be some disconnected client who never turned off their devices, but i can't tell with only the MAC. So i had an idea: ¿What if i let it connect to my network? Create a subnet for it to connect where i know it cant cause any harm on my net nor obtain information about it. And now that i have that device in my network, look for a way of obtaining more information about him.
 All in all, i want to know from people with experience in networking if in general this would be a good idea: Let an unkown host connect to your network so you can get more information about him, but heavily controlling its traffic and permissions so he wont be able to do anything inside your net.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company is migrating from Brocade/RUCKUS switches to Extreme. I managed to get one of our new Extreme switches online and passing traffic with no issue. While waiting for compatible SFP modules to arrive, I had it connected to our Brocade stack with a copper line configured for trunking on the Extreme side. 
 The SFP modules arrived and I was able to get them connected, set the VLANs, and OM3 MMC line came right up. The problem however is that once a users DHCP lease is up, if they're connected to the Extreme switch, their device won't obtain a new lease. When either line (fiber or copper) is connected, there's no issue. I don't think it's a routing a loop as anyone who's lease isn't up yet is operating fine. I confirmed the correct VLANs to communicate with our AD servers were present. 
 On the Brocade side, both lines out of the Extreme are connected to the same switch. None of our ports on any of our Brocades are configured for trunking, but is that my issue?
 ​
 Extreme:
 50, 52 configured as LAG and trunk
 1/50 fiber
 1/52 copper
 ​
 Brocade
 ports not configured as LAG or trunk
 2/2/5 fiber
 2/1/23 copper
 ​
 ​
 TLDR: Switch not passing DHCP traffic when both ports in a LAG/Trunk configuration are connected

 Yesterday I manually updated one of my client's NMC3 cards with the latest (2.5.0.6) firmware version. Looking at the device via web browser after the reboot there was a banner stating:
 2.5.x is the last NMC3 firmware version that will be available without an NMC3 Support Contract.
 I spent 20 minutes on the phone with APC Support to get some idea of what this was about.
 It seems that on May 1, 2023 APC/SE announced this change, which will become effective in Q3. There will be 1, 3, and 5 year contracts ranging in price from $50 to $225 (or as TDSynnex indicates $90 to $405 MSRP).
 Here's the only link the CSR was able to provide: https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SPD_HEPN-BFRL57_EN&p_enDocType=Brochure&p_File_Name=NMC3+Support+Contract+FAQ.pdf

 The user has a basic Outlook rule they enable when they go to lunch/are out of office to forward any emails sent to them to their coworker. They enable/disable this rule when they don't need the forwarding. However, when they try to disable this rule - it will continually re-enable itself. 
 Things we've tried:
 - Delete and recreate rule
 - Ran Office Repair
 - Deleted Mail Profile and recreated it
 - Ran Clean Rules Wizard
 - Delete SRS File
 We've confirmed other clients are not having issue. When attempting to turn off the rule in OWA, it appears to be disabling it in the local client correctly however. The opposite doesn't work. We're a hybrid O365 environment. I'm not understanding how this works - does anyone have any information on what would cause this or some things to try? At wit's end

The CFO wants another solution as he doesn't like OneDrive for file storage and neither do I. If we had a domain it would be easy to implement a file server with access permissions but since we don't have that yet I am looking for a solution. Does anyone have any recommendations on a good way to resolve this issue until the domain is in place? I know I could build a file server in Azure that everyone could access but then we have the security aspect of folders not being available. I thought about a storage device like Nasuni but again the folder permissions issue arises again. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hopefully you guys may have some solutions, but i have a few critical sites that my firm manages, and we have a few different monitoring applications we use for our own server infrastructure and websites individually. The issue I am running into is if a site was to go down at 3am my time (EST not that it matters) but i am sleeping. I have push notifications on my iphone, and have them classified as Critical alerts, so it will even come through on DND mode. BUT i am asleep, so one notification sound doesnt wake me up. I need like an alarm going off that i must dismiss, or separate device to deal with this. 
 I am hoping that there are others out there that might have a simple and good solution they have setup. I know there are enterprise level services that can do this type of thing, but I am a small business and that would most likely be too costly and unnecessary. Any ideas or recommendations to check out would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning all!
 -So yesterday, we started experiencing Outlook PRE in all of its glory.
 -a few end-users (who swear they didn't click the "try the new Outlook" toggle) ended up with Outlook Pre and it was stuck pinned to their taskbars with no way to unpin it?? On top of that, it bricked their Office 365 install AND broke their MFA so we had to reactivate their 2FA on all of those devices just to get it working again.
 -I have found some registry changes online to remove the toggle for new Outlook, but I am not sure if this is the same thing as the Windows Mail app seems to be gone on these workstations as well. While we ALL know one thing - end users lie lol, we also know Microsoft likes to use us as their beta test guinea pigs sometimes..
 ​
 -How TF do we stop this? so far it has only been a few workstations, but since it is bricking their 365 AND their 2FA, this could turn into a management nightmare and bury our guys fast. Anybody have suggesstions? My google-fu hasn't led me to a KB or anything pushing this program, but is creating a monitored service for that registry key that disables the toggle our best option?

 After restarting the server everything was ok. SEL showed entries "DDR4_A2: Correctable ECC Asserted" around 60 times a minute before the restart. 
 Windows also reported WHEA warnings (hardware error occurred). After restart, server has been running for a day now without any warning or error. It's located at a remote location, so I haven't had a chance to reseat DIMMs. RAM tests come up clean. System BIOS is from 2018. Is this a case of bad RAM or can I do something before travelling to service the server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says. You can't fleece or finesse your way getting local, high-skilled techs to do your work for you, run your business, onboard clients and expect to streamline your work in a matter of a few years, while sitting back drinking, snorting powder, or whatever pipe dreams you have. It may work for a little while, but you will eventually end up with employees, and clients alike, who will devalue your business to its demise. 
 Where I'm from there's a toxic culture of this at the moment. Just because you started your IT career in 08 doesn't quantify your business for 15 years in service with a solid client base, when you decided to break off in 2018 and "be your own boss".
 Now, this is mainly for prospective employees looking to get into the MSP realm, fresh out of college, first IT jobs. Be very, very careful when applying and accepting positions for MSP's. Do your research, look up the directors and consultants and their history. If you don't, you will burn your resume with short stints at these failed businesses, who fight over breadcrumb clients with their empty promises of a seamless silver service. 
 Always ratio the business in terms of current techs to managed clients before accepting a position - at the moment a safe zone and job security is 1:50, and may even move more towards 1:75 1:100 as more businesses go cloud. Anything less and you are only going to fill a void for 6-12 months and end up in the endless cycle of last in first out, as business goes through peaks and troughs at certain times of the year. 
 This is not speculation, it's a reality.

 a number of ISP's including AltNets are using DHCP to assign IP's where in the past they would have used PPPoE. I'm just wondering why the transition & how they are ensuring accountability. 
 I've worked for a number of global ISP's in enterprise services but never in the broadband space so just wondering how they ensure they meet the challenge of being able to be certain that a certain IP actually belongs to a specific customer.
 It's not that hard to change the advertised MAC & IP of the device connecting to their network, I guess they could tie the customer IP to their demarc interface & be certain that anything coming into their demarc is from that subscriber regardless of MAC or IP.
 Just curious as to how they meet the audibility regulatory requirement without the customer using a username & password to authenticate their conenction.

 Is anyone also experiencing memory leak issue in their ACX1100? We have experienced multiple occurrences of memory leak on ACX1100 installed and would require reboot to be performed as workaround for the router to be performing again. Have verified that ACX1100 due to its design limitations, memory leak is occurring due to routes and/or routing processes which the router cannot handle. Would like to know if anyone have encountered the same issue and what has been the resolution in your network scenario.
 Monitored that memory leak on the ACX persists even after upgrading JUNOS from 20.2R2-S1.3 to 20.4R1.12. Verifying with JTAC, memory leak is triggered due to device configuration but the root cause for the permanent fix is due to software PR. I am still awaiting next service release for JUNOS 20.4R3-S8 to confirm with Juniper if memory leak issue finally resolved for next service release.
 Thanks!

 I think I finally made peace with leaving my network security experience and go into cloud studies in my free time. Market is shit and they never look for junior, also cost of living is catching up with me and money for such lower position are not there..
 Still, Id need advice on which cloud to choose for chance of prospecting position in EU. I know AWS dominated in USA - anybody has an idea what is more dominant in EU? AWS or AZURE? No idea if my firewall engineer experience accounts to something here, but I guess I stopped caring at this point.
 Also, are there security related positions not requiring me to be semi-skilled developer in cloud? Which certs to focus on?

 in my company there are developers (4-5) that use a Device Mac OS as a build machine to push to Azure DevOps. The problem is that they use a service account on the Mac OS. 
 The best practice is to use nominal account for users on that device and then logon/logoff for every user, while software runs in background.
 Do you ever encounter this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ideally looking at companies with 10k+ devices/employees.
 We currently do a gold image for specified models of devices. We have quite a lot of strict security guidelines for what we can and can't use. It's a time consuming process doing a task sequence in MECM, manually doing drivers and BIOS updates and configuring it for lots of different branding packs, languages etc. Windows updates take a long time to deploy and manage. We're almost entirely on prem but moving services to the cloud slowly.
 I'm looking at making it more flexible. Anything is on the table, cost aside.
 Management hear about autopilot and cloud and think it's great. Is it? Is it possible at this scale?
 The "ideal" world is: as many people on cloud as we can. Onboarding is streamlined, models / vendor are mostly agnostic. Open up a ton more options for device models etc. Drivers and things are managed much easier, allowed straight out to the internet and updated as needed.
 Again cost is not an issue.
 Only issues: require lots of compliancy. Lots of standard software, endpoint management etc. Lots of office based and remote workers.
 What are you guys doing? What would you like to do? What would you do with infinite budget?

 Recently created a new Windows 2022 Standard virtual server using VMWARE esxi, however it appears to randomly go into an "unresponsive" state. I'm unable to ping the device, RDP, access it from the VMware web console and I'm unable to power off the VM.
 After about 5-10 minutes it will randomly be responsive again and I'm able to force shut it down/power it back on. There's nothing in the windows event viewer logs so I'm unsure if its a Windows issue or VM. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! Just wanted to share a bit about my background. I joined my company as a network engineer about 3 months ago, bringing along my CCNP certification and previous experience in Cisco networking. Although I have some familiarity with basic Linux commands, my main expertise lies in the networking side of IT.
 Now, here's where things get interesting. The senior system administrator recently left the company, leaving me in charge of managing all the systems and servers. To be honest, I feel a bit overwhelmed and lacking in confidence. The senior guy still tries to help me out when he can, but he's got his own projects keeping him busy.
 The senior IT guy at our company has over 20 years of experience, and he's incredibly knowledgeable. He seems to have a natural understanding of all aspects of systems and developments. Technical stuff comes easily to him, so he never really felt the need to document everything. Before he left, he did his best to teach me, but I must admit it wasn't enough for me. I'm not placing any blame on him, though. In fact, I really liked working with him and learned a lot. I'm simply sharing my current situation and the challenges I'm facing in my role.
 Let me give you an idea of what I'm dealing with. I've got my hands full with various VMs, including a Perforce server, TrueNAS, Active Directory, PFSense firewall, NextCloud, and several customer server VMs. The thing is, I'm fairly new to VMware systems, Linux, NAS, and PFSense. It doesn't seem like the company is planning to hire a senior IT person anytime soon, so it looks like I'll be flying solo in the IT department for a while.
 I know I need to upskill and expand my knowledge, but any advice or tips you have for someone in my shoes would be greatly appreciated!

 My issue upon attempting to Submit a Sample is I get greeted with this message:

 This is even after I submit a domain, but I am unable to submit file samples it appears.

 Not sure if this is an error on my end or theirs. I utilize open source intelligent information for cyber security research and testing and was attempting to use the AlienVault OTX platform but it seems I am unable to take advantage of their sample submission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings:
 We are upgrading from a pair of SN2010 (eighteen 10/25Gb ports + four 100Gb ports) to a pair of SN2100 (sixteen 100Gb ports) for our TOR switches. These switches are all running the Onyx operating system.
 We have deployed several sets of SN2010 switches for us and our clients over the past four years. We decided to upgrade to SN2100 to get more port density by using 100Gb optics and breakout cables. 
 We configured a SN2100 switch and swapped it in for one of our SN2010 switches. 
 This issue we are having is that whenever we connect a host one of the four breakout pairs, the port flaps every 30 seconds. We have configured the new switch port identically to our existing switches and connected to existing hosts that have Mellanox NICs in them. 
 When we connect the same 10/25Gb breakout to another switch, we have no issues. We only experience the issue when we connect a host (server or workstation) with SFP+. 
 We've used a 100Gb to 25Gb converter with both an optical transceiver as well as DAC cable and get the same results; the port stays up when connected to another switch (Mellanox or other brand) and the port flaps when that same connection terminates into a host (server or workstation).
 During the time the port is up, we have connectivity.
 Any ideas what this might be or what to try next?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started a Network Engineering role back in November 2022. I like the job but today I was told about another job as a Senior Network Engineer at an MSP for about 20K more. 
 I was always taught that you stay with your company and show loyalty, but later in life I had a Network Engineer tell me that people always bounce around in IT careers. 
 The company I work for now is a family-owned company where people stay for many years if not their whole career (Non-IT). I like what I do and it is easy. Not really challenging I just don't know if I should take the advice of moving around. I have never worked for an MSP. I am wondering if I should just stick it out or take the money. 
 I feel like if I leave the company I am with now that I will burn a bridge that I cannot come back to. 
 I guess the question is how long do you all stay at a job before taking another?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, so here it goes. I work for an MSP where it's a very small number of people (30, whole company) supporting literally thousands of pcs and servers as we have a fair number of clients. We are constantly swamped, under pressure, behind, but they don't want to pay another person. On top of all of this, there are serious communication issues.
 This is my first experience with an MSP so I don't know what's normal and what isn't, but 1 am being paid 35,000 a year for this and I'm about done. I took the crap salary for the experience and l've gained serious experience with Exchange, 365, ADs, firewall policies, dhcp, etcetera so it wasn't a complete loss.
 My issue is : I'm ready to take the experience learned and jump ship, but I'm scared that maybe it's just this rubbish everywhere. Is this normal? What's a normal workload? I have only had a couple years of work in IT before this. Is this just the world of sysadmin, network engineer in general? Hit me with your stories and experiences

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone else screwed over by this? I just found out because CloudFlare sent me an email warning me about the massive change. Seems like Google kills everything that is good.
 Personally, I would like to just transfer all of my domains to Cloudflare's registrar and keep all renewals managed in the same place, problem is they don't take the newer TLDs like .dev.
 Anyone have any suggestions on registrars that are friendly to use when you manage tons of domains? 
 Also need advice on downtime, I have never actually transferred domains from Google before. Ideally I would want to be able to make sure that the Authoritative NS are set to Cloudflare on the new registrar side before transfer so that there is no DNS issues and down time, and no recreating a bajillion DNS records.
 I do not pay for Cloudflare either, just using free tier and most domains don't even need any proxying. If there is a registrar that makes it easy to import DNS records from Cloudflare, that might be a good option as well.

 Idk why, but it grinds my gears when I'm trying to focus on something and I get the dumbest escalations from helpdesk, I just facepalm and do basic tasks for them. Either that or ask them what exactly they've done and where they're stuck and why it's being escalated at all. Even from management on occasion "can you help user with their outlook, x y and z on helpdesk are busy."
 I'm wondering if it's worth it to pursue a change in my contract to put in a clause where no end user support will be expected of me. What's the general vibe on this?

But recently I found that wmi is way more powerful than that. For example, it can be used to monitor a service and whenever it gets restarted, run some script. I want to be serious about this technology and want to learn more about it. Where should I start? Is there any good book about WMI? or websites? I noticed that there seems a whole query language in wmi which is kind of intimidating. I'm very familiar with sql. But I don't know where to start and apply my SQL knowledge to help me understand wmi.

 Wyrestorm NHD600 Series video endpoints require 10G. They have certified the FS S5860-24XB-U with their product so I'm not worried about it working, and I can get around any switch GUI or CLI... but I'm more interested in the stuff that isn't on the datasheet. Failures? Support? This only has a 4 year warranty (whereas Netgear is lifetime). 
 I know many here (and myself included) use FS for transceivers, cables, and other fiber products... but I'm a bit on edge about electronics.

 Unfortunately we plugged some standard singlemode fiber cables with LC/PC connectors into fixed LC/APC sockets. We got a link and didn't notice or care for a while but now we noticed (mysteriously) reduced performance. We want to replace the cables to fix this, replacing the sockets would be much more difficult. Does anyone have experience with this situation? Some googling just tells me that this might damage the connectors, but I am not sure how likely this is. Would we clearly see damage with an optical microscope?

I'm trying to get them on to the latest firmware that I found (R.11.123). I downloaded this firmware and placed it in a folder that is being shared over the network, with security and share permissions set to allow Everyone full control.
 ​
 I downloaded and installed Solarwinds TFTP Server and it is currently running. I changed the root folder to be the local path of where this file is located (C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Files). Solarwinds is set to permit send and receive from all IPs. No other changes were done.
 ​
 I Telnet to the switches and run the command: copy tftp flash IP R11123.swi secondary -- For IP, I have the IP of the Windows server where Solarwinds is installed and the file resides. I have copied and pasted the file name but have also tried typing it out by hand but I keep getting: 00000K Transport error. I can't find the page now, but I saw an HP page that said it's either permissions, file name, or the file doesn't exist in the location.
 ​
 What am I doing wrong? I've been pulling my hair out for 2 days trying to figure this out.

 I am looking to upgrade our switch to take advantage of faster available port speeds.
 This is our current model:
 HP 2620-48 J9627A

 We need about the same number of ports as well as at least 1gig ports all the way around.
 I found a couple of options:

 https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/48-port-netgear-gs752tp-v2-switch-l3-smart-48-x-10-100-1000-poe-4-x-...
 Any other suggestions would be much appreciated. We have a basic network so dont need advanced features. Just need enough POE to power our ip phones and the ability to take advantage of 1gig internet speeds.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Working on an issue that is causing me a lot of stress. 
 There are many sites that have been cut over to a new internet circuit successfully. A simple swap of cables and minor adjustments, and they're off to the races. 
 There's one site that just won't cooperate. 
 We cut over the site, and SLA monitors show 50%+ packet loss. Link itself has been end-to-end RFC2544 tested by the SP with no apparent issues. 
 What's more, a backup link that goes entirely unused once the cutover is complete and testing is performed shows the same high levels of packet loss. This occurs only when traffic is pushed over the link; on idle packet loss is 0% across the board. The same behavior can be observed for latency and jitter. 
 The existing link is unaffected. Regardless of a lower available bandwidth, it is largely stable. The backup link, if utilized when the original link is in place proves to be of a lower than expected quality when utilized, but it is wireless so there may be more elements causing that. 
 The behavior of all monitored connections, including the unused backup link showing high packet loss when migrated to the new link is puzzling. I can only imagine that it would be down to electrical interference or poor grounding quality as I have tested all other elements isolated from one another to ensure it wasn't caused by the site equipment. Some hardware replacements or failovers have been made to no avail. 
 The routing, switching, and new circuit are all in the same rack. The existing circuit is wall mounted in the same room. The backup link modem is in another room, but is connected by a single cable back to the rack and is otherwise not grounded. 
 Would this be a reasonable element to look in to in order to troubleshoot the issue?

 We are a small company who sells software to hospitals.
 The software is a web application wich is hosted at the costumers network.
 To do maintanance and updates we need access. 
 So we have our company network (192.172.180.0/24) (f.e. just with 3 laptops),
 And a second subnet (network on the left .183.0/24).
 The networks are connected by a sophos hardware firewall.
 on the .183 there are many site to site tunnels configured to the coustumers network.
 So always one site the .183.0/24 and the other site the coustumers network. 
 So to Acess the costumers network we have to connect from the .180 company network to the .183 network to a windows vm with RDP. Than we are on the network wich has the site to site tunnels. 
 My question , can you call that a dmz ?

We are currently building a new network in our building while keeping the old network setup active. I put the ISP line into a dummy switch that had a line going to the old network setup to keep the building tenants live and a line to the new setup so I can work on configuring the new network switches. I was working on adding vlans to the ports so that some only had the external traffic straight from the ISP and some ports only had network traffic for an internal trusted network that comes from a watchguard firewall. Everything was working great until I made port 1 (where the isp comes into the switch) a tagged port with the external vlan (999) and management vlan (1). The moment I did that, the switch lost connection to the cloud AND it "broke" the internet for all tenants on the old network set up. See the attached network diagram for more details. Now I wiped the GS728TPPv2 and removed it from the cloud. Even from factory default settings, the moment I connect the GS728TPPv2 to the dummy switch, it breaks the internet for the users on the old network. How do I fix this loop/routing issue?

I already know of RMM tools like Kaseya, NinjaOne, etc. The kind of software I was pointed to (Store Gazer) looks to be more like a DEX system like Lakeside, and NexThink. My questions is what are the fundentmental differences between DEX tools like Lakeside and RMM tools like NinjaOne? 
 From what I can tell, they appear to be very similar. DEX is geared more towards letting the end user fix issues while RMM is more for full remote system management. THey each seem to overlap on some things. I mostly need a system to monitor system resources and try to notice a failure before it hits (like a failing HD). 
 I was hoping someone has had experience with them both and can pinpoint a clearer use case difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm changing my company's ISP from Windstream (T1 lol) to AT&T gig fiber. We will have an SD-WAN but they are coming to install that later so I don't have to worry about that. Spectrum will be used as a backup circuit for the SD-WAN.
 I have never switched ISPs for a company before. We have one static IP we utilize. We use a VMware Windows 2012 r2 server for everything as this is a small family business. 
 Am I correct in assuming all I need to do to change us over, is change the IP information in Server Manager/DNS manager and plug the new router in to the switch rack?
 Sorry if this is a dumb one, but I'm still learning and I want to do a good job here.
 Thank you so much in advance to anyone who takes the time out of their day to help! I really appreciate this community.

 My supervisor left and i've been given command. I was about to given "Sr. Network & Systems Admin", but with his departure i can take on the title 'VP of IT". 
 I'm a very technical person, i love getting dirty in the nitty gritty and working on stuff. If i take this new title of "VP of IT" and want to move on to other technical roles else where, would this title scare potential employers away? With them thinking i'm either just a manager or they dont want a former head of IT working as some System admin? I want to eventually evolve my career away from networking admin and focus solely on System admin and security.

 sentinelone is constantly flagging files with no real virus mentioned. seems the AI picks up things like OS ENTRY records and Modifies system files as the flags... 
 Is whitelisting for exclusion the CONFIG.MSI folder a good idea.. seems like a good place for virus and root kits to be injected.. that would be where they may try.

We are currently working on finishing up our migration to 365 and working to move printers and internal apps to not use our internal exchange server for SMTP. My boss is a bit worried about direct send/authenticated SMTP to 365 as he has concerns over publishing all remote office IPs within the SPF record (as well as other concerns). I understand the concerns, but feel it may not be fully warranted.
 I was wondering if anyone has deployed an internal SMTP relay that is not an exchange server or any other suggestions to not require publishing all remote office public IPs via the SPF. TIA!

If I wait around 3-5 minutes and then try the add on or via the link they both work just fine.
 Teams also starts when a user logs on, normally ready within the first 20 seconds of being logged in and is definitely running by the time the users try to access the meeting.
 I have made sure the browser, teams and Outlook are all up to date but still have this issue.
 I can only assume that there is something Teams needs to be running before it has this function and it takes around 3-5 minutes for this to run. Does anyone have a fix/work-a-round for this or encountered the same issue I'd love to know.
 Or if anyone knows what it is teams waits for I could even try looking into finding a way to get this running much sooner in the log on processthat'd be great.
 Any help is much appreciated.

 I'm starting a new position at an established company that never really had IT and was wondering if there have been any posts where people share their system management stack? If not, I was hoping I could get some examples of what people use and how happy they are with each tool. I've included a few I have touched in my career but it's always nice to hear opinions for different size companies. I'm hoping to cover:
 System Management/MDM (Intune, Workspace One)
 Collaboration (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace)
 Remote control (Logmein, Splashtop, Connectwise)
 Client VPN (OpenVPN, Zerotier)
 Security Camera System (Verkada, Hikvision (ugh), Truvision)
 Antivirus/EDR (SentinelONE, Microsoft Defender)
 EDR SOC addon (Huntress, SentinelONE Vigilance)
 Networking (Meraki, Aruba, Ubiquiti)
 Meetings (Zoom, Teams, Goto, Google Meet)
 Password Manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass)
 Identity Management (Azure AD, Okta)
 IT Documentation (IT Glue, Hudu)
 Messaging (Teams, Slack)
 Email Security (Mimecast, Proofpoint)
 Vulnerability Scanning (Qualys)
 Voip (RingCentral, Teams, Goto)
 SIEM (Splunk, Solarwinds)
 I probably missed a few things on the list but you get the idea. I have never had quite so many holes to fill before and it's exciting to be able to build out the entire environment so it can all work together well.
 Thanks so much for the help and I hope others can find this useful too!

 Enter Microsoft Purview. We moved over to Defender about a year ago but never really got around to looking into how deep the rabbit hole truly goes. We’re dipping our toes into DLP and some other compliance measures and holy shit the power of Purview scares the hell out of me. Literally every single thing that anyone does across all devices is right there in a near real time list. Of course Microsoft categories for things are all sorts of fucked up but you don’t even have to look for anything specific for peoples entire work lives to just appear before your eyes. 
 Is this all just too much? I honestly feel conflicted in using this as it feels too intrusive. I’ve been involved in many investigations of employee misuse of resources etc but they have been specifically targeted and all actions audited for that exact purpose and the tools for it were essentially under lock and key. Now with Purview it’s all just…there. It feels wrong to me.

We have a POS (piece of shit) software that has a new version that for some stupid reason suddenly requires Administrative credentials to install even though it install under user context (in user AppData). This obviously renders our management tools (PDQ & Intune) unable to perform the installation.
 The support at the vendor is clueless and doesn't seem to understand the issue. Apparently in their mind everyone has administrative access so this should be none issue.
 I've run procmon to try and catch the part that triggers the UAC prompt but I'm not exactly sure what to look for. I believe it is trying to access/write something to the HKLM hive or class root hive.
 Any tips or links to guides would be greatly appreciated at this point.
 Edit: the new version does not have "UAC Compliant" checked when I viewed it in Orca. Any idea if that's the root cause here?

 Due to the increasing popularity and widespread usage of ChatGPT or any AI in general, I wanted to explore how AI can enhance the day-to-day activities of sysadmins, enabling them to be more productive and efficient in their roles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a kinda new sysadmin and a user asked if it would be possible to optimise this process:
 He works on department A and creates documentation in this structure:
 \server\department_a\projectx\documentation
 every time he creates documentation there he has to manually copy and paste it to:
 \server\department_b\project_x\documentation
 so the people from department B can get the documentation to send to the clients.
 Is there any way to make it so every time he creates a file on "\server\department_a\projectx\documentation" it is automatically copied to "\server\department_b\project_x\documentation"?
 I've tried making a softlink with mklink command, but it seems that it doesn't work on shared folders. Another option that comes to my mind is to create a batch that automatically checks whether a new file is created on said folders and if so it copies it to the other one, but I would like to know if there's any other option that I haven't thought of.

 Is there such a think however as turning a 40g/100G port into 4 x 10g ports that you can plug a SFP cable into? 
 So rather than a male connector it would be female I guess? 
 Does that make sense? so instead of a 40Gb SFP port I now have 4 x 10Gb ports? 
 Thanks!

 Currently working on a project to replace our Dell NX3230 (W2K12 R2 Storage Server). We have had a quote back from Dell and I notice that they are only offering Windows Storage Server 2016 which goes end of life in less than 4 years.
 Obviously, I want to get the best life out of this hardware as we are a small business, but I am now worried that I won't even be able to get 5 years out of this bit of kit before EOL.
 It looks to me that I might have to bite the bullet and buy a full Windows Server license for this device so I can run Server 2022, but judging by the Dell downloads page, its unclear if this would even be a supported OS for this hardware.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on this or alternatives I can look at?
 TIA

 Sysmon64.exe -c sysmonconfig.xml

 ​
 Despite the successful update, upon checking the configuration, we discovered that it was not being read, and only the default values were being installed. We have attempted various XML files, but since ours have not been changed for some time, the problem persists. We even created a new configuration file with a few rules, but encountered the same issue. Additionally, we tried downgrading to the previous version, but the problem remains unresolved.
 If anyone has any insights or ideas on how to resolve this issue, we would greatly appreciate your assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, looking into VMware SD-WAN (Formerly or still Velocloud?) and got a few questions. For our business, it seems great so far given it can do per-packet flow over multiple connections rather than per-session flow so that we can aggregate multiple connection together for a single client. Being able to have a routed subnet is crucial for us given we host a few email servers, file servers, and websites out of our office. So, if we grab two velocloud devices and place one in our colo in the data center, and one here at our head office, are we able to propagate an IP block we get from the data center over the velocloud to use for our core router at the office? We have VPN connections, and lots of different configurations I'd rather not have to change and would prefer if we could use the velocloud to push us that routed subnet possibly via BGP to our router where it can pick it up. Is this something Velocloud is able to accomplish or no?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My management is blocking my suggestion of the use of Netbox even though my peers feel it would advantageous for us to have. The reason he is blocking it is, 1. It runs on Linux. 2. It is open-source. My management is against the use of Linux in all applications and is also against open-source. He believes Linux opens our environment to more vulnerabilities and potential security risks which I understand is not a fair assessment. He is also against open-source due to lack of official support that we can't pay for. He does not like the idea that support comes from blogs, reddit, etc. Frustrating :( 
 ​
 However, currently my team is managing ~100 locations information from over 10-15 different excel spreadsheets. This includes contacts, circuit information, devices, etc. I think we need it but I dont know how to approach it or become a better influencer to encourage the use of it. Any professional help would be good. Thanks

 In the past, she has had issues around user security and people messing up the devices. First thing I'm wondering is what's the go-to solution for desktop device management in small business offices where everyone is using Windows.
 Second, I'm thinking whether it would be a wise move to buy 1 or 2 excellent servers and just give everyone a Windows VM running in the server that they can connect to via a thin-client from their desks. Does this type of solution work well, or is it better to just give everyone a good dedicated machine running Windows for them to use?

 First of all before I go in what I need I just want to say I am only a couple of hours of research in, my understanding of things like DSC and infrastructure as code is limited and this is why I am here, so hopefully I can get someone with more experience to give me their opinion on where I should head.
 The gist is that I need to automate environment creation whilst working working with Hyper-V.
 Everything from VM creation, OS installation, integration with AD, setting up of features like SQL Always On and IIS load balancing, I need to be automated with very little interaction, I am going to be deploying hundreds of servers and want to make it reliable and repeatable as possible.
 So my real question is, should I expect this to be easily feasible to implement, if so how do you do it? and do you have any resources you could share like git projects. 
 Many thanks in advance!

 Getting on with it...
 February 2023
 Since I got radio silence from the fiber planning department and the ISP, I decided to call both of them once again, and got the same response: "It's done when it's done, we'll notify you."
 March 2023
 Middle of march, a parcel arrives at our location. It's a router. I didn't order a router. It also had no information on who sent the parcel. Deep down in the package, there was the packing list: It was actually the ISP which just sent us a new router, probably for the fiber connection. Great! That means it can't take long anymore, can it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day, I'm fairly new to the Linux environment and only took a semester of it in college. I'm attempting to setup a PXE boot server with the latest Ubuntu server release (I think 20.04.6) and after setting up the DHCP role and PXE role and grabbing all the necessary files in all the right directories, my client machine can PXE boot to an extent.
 When I network boot on the client, I get the IP info of the PXE server, then the gateway, and then PXE-E32: TFTP open timeout. This repeats 3 times. I verified my settings 3x, but I've been using ChatGPT as my guide. So something is inevitably messed up. Does anyone have suggestions?

I have 6 ap's that were connected to the virtual wireless controller that had a "capwap ap erase all" command run on them. They now will not join the physical 5508 controller or the virtual controller that they were previously connected to. 
 I see the AP mac's listed in "show ap join stats summary all" command and if I do "show ap join stats detailed" on the ap mac I see that the physical controller is successfully discovering the device, but it isn't going anywhere from there, it never attempts to join because there are no join requests received or denied. 
 SSH appears to be disabled on default and the AP's are in locations that are very hard to get to. Any ideas on how to get these things to join up to either of the controllers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company's ISP offers us an ipv6 /56 prefix. We run the fiber directly to our switches and run virtual VyOS firewalls so there is no ISP gear. Now I wonder what options I have for subnetting since I obviously don't want to put all of the devices on the WAN side. Still I'm trying to have redundant firewalls.
 I was thinking I could perhaps select one /64 for WAN and set up both firewalls to send RAs for the same internal /64 subnets and then ask the ISP to tweak timeouts to ensure failover happens without too much delay, like in this example: http://www.bscottrandall.com/9.2.5.html#ra-message-as-substitute-for-fhrp .
 Otherwise I guess I could ask them to route my /56 through e.g. the first IP in the block and then use VRRP on my firewalls. Not sure if they offer dhcpv6 prefix delegation (like you'd use on a typical home router) and not sure if I even want to use that, since it will limit my options for redundancy. I'm an ipv6 noob and I feel I'm maybe missing something obvious.

 Today was the last straw when I was asked to do something that "you said would take a minute", for reference I never said that about this, it was something else that I delivered 2 weeks ago. Top it off, since then the guy has permissions to make a service principal now.
 So I told my boss to text me if he needs me and I turned off slack on my phone and computer. I am late by weeks on so many projects because of this. I can't be much more late on this since it's needed for multiple other initiatives. I'm not in trouble or anything but I'm getting people asking "when will this be done" at this point... The answer is never at this rate.

 I am a sysadmin for my company whose weakest area is networking so forgive me if I am missing something or if this question is stupid. Our network SME is off this week and I am being asked to look into this issue. 
 All of the wireless devices at a single company location are all of a sudden unable to access our official internal SSID. I checked the event viewer on the RADIUS server and am seeing tons of errors in the Event viewer, more specifically Event 18, "An Access-Request message was received from RADIUS client {server IP} with a Message-Authenticator attribute that is not valid".
 I did basic troubleshooting such as restarting the NPS service and rebooting the server to no avail. I checked the RADIUS clients and the group configured for this location is showing that it is enabled and that there is a shared secret entered in. I checked our Meraki dashboard and when I looked at the logs for the APs at this location, I see tons of errors with the message "Client failed 802.1X authentication to the RADIUS server. auth_mode='wpa2-802.1x' vlan_id='10' radius_proto='ipv4' radius_ip='10.11.8.121' reason='radius_login_failure' radio='1' vap='0' channel='36' rssi='26' "
 My googling has led me down the path of there being a possible problem with the shared secret and to recreate it. However, I am just looking for some general guidance here and seeking someone to point me in the right direction because I am lost on this issue. 
 Thank you.

 ​
 We have most fixed devices assigned in the router by MAC reservation outside of the DHCP pool.
 We have a few devices that were added and had their MACs added to the IP reservations BUT the IP addresses were IPs that were in the DHCP pool range. 
 Recently we lost communication with a couple of devices and sure enough they were units that had their MACs reserved but their addresses had been occupied by other wifi devices that had joined the network? 
 It was always my understand that if an IP is reserved/assigned to a MAC, then this IP address is specifically for that device? Is this only the case if the IP address is outside of the DHCP pool? If the reserved IP is IN the pool, can any other networked device occupy that IP instead if the reserved device is offline? 
 Sorry if this is a very silly question!

 Having done some digging I think it's because the SD-WAN solution uses a proprietary routing protocol that is being redistributed into BGP on their routers in each DC. The core switches have "redistribute direct" set with a route-map that sets the metric to 70 and 75 so the connected routes get advertised to both the WAN and the other DC.

 IP-Routing: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 25 Mbps - 128 bytes 43 Mbps - 256 bytes 83 Mbps - 512 bytes 96 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps
 MPLS: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 21 Mbps - 128 bytes 35 Mbps - 256 bytes 67 Mbps - 512 bytes 95 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps
 The network itself is really simple and consists of 4 Routers in a ring. The tester sends the data to the input router that forwards the packet over one of the two transport routers to the output router and to the tester at the end and back again. The MPLS configuration was done without special stuff using OSPF as IGP and adding "tag-switching ip" to the interfaces.
 Maybe someone can give me a possible explanation
 Edit: Routers are quite old, Cisco 2811 ISR

 I'm usually working solo on a remote site with few other people around, so when we have issues with a multicore fibre - usually someone has damaged the cable or mice have broken pigtails - I connect my fibre torch to one end and walk over to the other side to check for the light before repeating until I find a working pair. 
 Is there a device, which could simultaneously test up to an 8 core cable? Visual only for fault finding, anything more specific and we'd use a contractor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m going to be segmenting our flat corporate network and could use some advice. Currently both servers and clients are all on the same network and we just rely on host based firewalls on the servers to protect everything. I’m going to set up separate VLANs for servers, printers, IoT stuff, and client machines, and then route them through our firewall with the appropriate rules. 
 How can I determine what kind of overhead this is going to require from our firewalls? I’m concerned our hardware firewalls may not be able to process the amount of traffic going through it. They currently only process traffic in and out to the internet.

 Currently my org does this manually at about 40+ people and it's pretty painful. We:
 Have a master spreadsheet for all tools
 Owners of these tools are spread across the org mostly with the founders and some founding engineers (trying to transfer ownership to me but with some tools it looks like we need to pay to add more seats)
 Don't have a consistent way to manage the security, provisioning and de-provisioning of this today
 We use a Zendesk form in Slack for hiring managers to add tool provisioning requests for their new hires. Same request process for existing employees looking for access to other tools in the org.
 We don't have a great way or policy for new tool sign up - I feel like this should go through me but again, very manual
 Curious to hear how you're managing this :
  
How big / mature is your org
 What process / tooling do you have in place - what's the good/bad/ugly on this
 What role do you play in managing this process
 
 TIA!

We currently have the free version of Azure, which would make hybrid the better option I think since I can still update group policies using the local domain controller.
 My question is, once I setup the Azure AD Connect on the local domain controller, would my users still be able to log into their current AD account to access their windows profiles on their computers? From my understanding, using their 365 to log in will create a new windows profile, which is fine. But I’d still like them to be able to access their windows profile from the local AD account so I have time to migrate settings and data.

When opening the start menu and searching, the start menu is blank with only dots cycling near the top (like its trying to find something). We've had a case with Microsoft open for months now but they're basically useless.
 I believe the root of the issue in that ShellExperienceHost is not running. We've tried re-registering the application on the base image:
 Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
 If I try to start the ShellExperienceHost process manually, we get this error:
 The system detected an overrun of a stack-based buffer in this application. This overrun could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of this application. 
 In Event Viewer, we see this error:
 Faulting application name: ShellExperienceHost.exe, version 10.0.19041.1949 Faulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version 10.0.19041.2913 Exception code: 0xc0000409 Faulting application path: C:\Windows\SystemApps\ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\ShellExperienceHost.exe Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\KERNELBASE.dll 
 I've tried repairing using SFC/DISM. I can recreate the issue with and without our profile management software. I tried an in-place upgrade from 21H2->22H2 but that also did not resolve the issue. Anyone seen something similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings all,
 We are looking for a software tool that can help auto-deploy VMs for software testing and validation. This tool should allow us to pick a combination of architectures (ARM, x86, M1/M2, etc) and OSes (Mac, Linux, Windows, etc) to auto-deploy either on a local server or cloud device. Once the deployment is done, we will execute some automation tools to validate a test branch of our software, report some findings, and then terminate the test device. The test VMs won't live very long; just long enough to run some test cases and record the output (via shared volume, etc).
 At this point, we are looking at a varity of deploment tools (LXD, Docker, Terraform, etc) but have not landed on one just yet. The important thing is the ability to select from a matrix of architecture and OS selections, click "GO", and ultimately get access to the test systems.
 Hope this makes sense. Thanks for any pointers.

There 3 of us in the IT team locally and would say we’ve become friends as well as colleagues. The gig is easy but i don’t feel like i’m challenged I manage the helpdesk and AD, Exchange stuff groups, mailboxes etc and provide regular tech support. 
 Buddy works at a ISP that also provides a Business service side like MSP / Datacenter stuff and mentioned a Network Engineer position coming up. If the pay is better i’d be tempted to go for it but I’d feel bad for leaving the team just cause i know it’ll fuck them up for abit with the work. Has anyone else felt like this before and how you navigated it?
 I could stay but i just feel stuck on helpdesk. The sysadmin above me was doing it for like 6 years before he moved up to more server stuff and projects. But i could only go up if someone comes under me or everyone above moves up 1 position but the company would never hire more people we been struggling to get a third in one location since i joined. 
 I don’t hold any certs but studying Net+ at the moment
 I don’t really care for the end users and rest of the company but the IT teams are really great chill guys to work with. But plugging in keyboards or showing people how to use a web browser earning more than me is abit disheartening haha
 TLDR: Possible chance to make the jump from helpdesk to network engineering, Have you ever found it hard to leave your IT colleagues for a new role.

 I'm a consultant, getting placed with different clients every 6 months or so.
 I've noticed that over the last year and a half, I keep getting placed in companies that want to call all their network engineers "DevOps" engineers, and end up being put on projects that have very little to do with networking. 
 The current one I'm doing is building a lot of grafana dashboard and using InfluxDB. 
 Whilst I do find this fun in my spare time on my home lab, I'm not a DBA or a software engineer, and I've really been struggling with doing this work professionally. 
 I feel like every role I am straying further and further from actually being a network engineer, and I'm forgetting things. I've been trying to recertify my CCNP and really struggling, because I'm just not using any of the knowledge. 
 Has anyone else had similar experiences in their roles?

 For setting up HA I thought VRRP looks good, however at this stage I'm a bit confused. Can I just set the ISP static IPs on 2 different interfaces on each router, then setup a simple VRRP and it will automatically handle this? Even if the slave router is inactive could it still not cause issues to use the same public IP as the other router in terms of routing tables at ISP level for example?
 I also see that VRRP supports LB which is also interesting. If anyone got any advice to clear up my confusion please let me know, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I'm facing network issues that affect hosts, that connect to the network, for some minutes.
 As soon as a host gets a connection to the network it starts sending out massive multicast / IGMP traffic (Membership report / Leave group 224.0.0.252). This happens for some seconds or even hours until it stops. During all the time the host is unable to communicate to the network as most packets get lost and dont even arrrive their destination.
 This doesnt happen when I simply disable multicast on the host, but this can't be the solution here.
 The issue was tested with 2 Windows VMs on a Xen Server cluster running on a FlexCenter. It has a trunked connection to the next (Netgear) switch. There are no VLANs. IGMP Snooping is turned of.The issue also exists on physical Windows clients in the network.
 One line from the wireshark report:
 No. Time Source Destination Prot. Lenght Info31134 926.817456 172.20.11.124 224.0.0.22 IGMPv3 60 Membership Report / Leave group 224.0.0.252
 Did anyone see such a behaviour before? What could cause this?

 It's option to create home_folder on Active Direcory Users and Computer ->User Properities->Profile->Home folder->Connect "I don't want to assign letter " ->To: \\company.local\share\home\user (DFS Namespace share)?

 I am cleaning up my companies Datacenter. We have moved from Physical to Virtual from 80 physical machines down to 12. The 7 new servers use fiber with 5 of the legacy machines using 4 ethernet lines each. Currently there appears to be around 300 ethernet cables running about the datacenter would it be worth removing the majority of them and only leaving about 40 since all the new servers we install run off fiber?
 ​
 I am also tasked with replacing the switching infrastructure in the Datacenter in a year from now and want to do this to help me get an accurate estimate on what costs would be instead of buying an exact match to what we currently have.

 4x Cisco Leaf(Nexus) << TRUNK >> DellMx7K with ESXi(Virtual switches and hosts running)
 I'm having an issue where Virtual hosts look to get dropped after a failover test on the virtual switches. Traffic would come into ACI on different ports. I did create a port-security policy to the interfaces with maxium endpoint value of 0 to disable. As per this document.
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/5-x/security/cisco-apic-security-configuration-guide-50x/m\_port\_security.html 
 Server team say it's has improved but not fully. Still some hosts disappearing for a short period after failover. Are there any other configurations I need to implement?
 ​
 This link below mentions disabling DTP and using 802.1q over ISL. I can't see where to set this is ACI.

 Something has changed where before we were able to log into a Tap scheduler with an MTR account (pro licence) without any issues. 
 Now we try to log in, it seems the device wants to enroll to Intune. Is there an easy way in which to bypass this? Is this a config on the Tap scheduler itself or Company Portal/Intune settings that is catching the device logging in and enforcing enrollment?
 error we're getting is "Signing out.. This device isn't enrolled in Device Administrator. Contact your Admin". (I am in contact with our admin as well)

 Has anyone ever considered creating personas for different types of users to enable automation?
 i'm thinking along the lines of: 
 ​
 Technical Development staff - these will have local admin rights, code app installed, member of development distribution list etc
 Backoffice staff - Marketing, Finance etc, these need MS Office installed and certain other groups etc.
 ​
 The end goal is to have each new starter automatically have 80% of what they need by virtue that I already know their persona so can automate their account creation and being added to certain groups to achieve it.
 ​
 Interested to hear if anyone's thought of doing similar or even better if it's ended up working out.

 VLAN15, 'MGMT-VLAN': 10.97.15.1 /24
 VLAN 100, 'Wireless Clients': 10.97.100.1 /24
 I have a Draytek Vigor 2960 connected to the switch via trunk port, Draytek is on IP 10.97.15.254 (VLAN 15)
 Cisco 2500 WLC connected to the switch on VLAN 15, IP address 10.97.15.254
 1 x Cisco AP on VLAN 15, IP address: 10.97.15.100
 Draytek FW is issue DHCP to VLAN 100 clients starting 10.97.100.100 - 210
 Interface and SSID setup and presumably working for wireless clients as I can connect to the SSID and pickup an IP, SM,GW and DNS that I specified on the DHCP server (Draytek)
 I can see clients connecting to the AP with the correct network details fro with the WLC, and I can see the same clients connect on the Draytek DHCP table, but my devices, android mobile and MacBook show connected without internet and Im not sure why.
 My devices can ping each over, i.e 10.97.100.100 can ping 10.97.100.101 and vice-versa but they cannot ping the VLAN gateway on 10.97.100.254 even though they are getting their DHCP details from that device.
 Im a bit stuck as to what could be the issue.... any ideas or able to point me in the right direction would be appreciated

 this is just to confirm: the HPE licensing calculator for Microsoft Windows Server suggests that there is always at least one 16-core license pack needed for every physical server (they label this a "base license"). All the other license packs (2-core, 4-core, and 16-core) are labeled "additional license", which suggests that these cannot be used stand-alone.
 We are thinking about getting 2-core packs only (please do not ask for the reasons, since that is beyond my paygrade).
 Would it be possible to license a server using only 2-core packs? Are there activation keys included in a 2-core pack?
 Thanks in advance!

 And have been tasked to make it work by a person who has no idea of how tape drives work . 
 It's to attach to a single backup server, no shared infrastructure. So in theory SAS should be the way to go, but the external cards I'm seeing are much more expensive somehow.
 Usually I would let the vendor sort this out, but that's kind of not an option here, so, before I screw up buying the wrong thing, any recommendations? 6GB SAS would be OK, volume isn't really huge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 Just need your opinions for those who have worked with out of band access devices as my work require one for lot of equipment such as routers/switches/firewalls in a data center. We are looking for a cheap alternative device that can be used temporarily on each equipment when doing interventions so it may not require many ports since it will be removed afterwards, maybe 4-8 ports. I did my research, mostly found that opengear models are pretty expensive.
 Opengear ACM7004-2 has 4 serial ports RJ-45, 4 USB ports, RS232 compatibility and is relatively small but price around $800. I found several models like these on their websites but with LTE which i don't really need. I was searching for cheaper alternatives. For the Opengear IM4208-2-DDC-X2-G, i don't have the price but has 8 ports RJ45/RS232, 1 usbport and has some good security features.
 Lantronix SLB console server has 8 ports and seems ideal but couldn't find its price and much specs about it, the SLC 8000 has 16 ports but seems pricey on amazon around $2000.
 The perle IOLAN SDG4 has 4 serial ports RJ45, RS232 local console port but cost around $1000. Surely there has to be a cheaper one.
 Digi CM 8 Console Server 8 Port has 8 RJ45/RS232 ports and 1 console port RJ45/RS232, i don't have the price for this one but it does feature auth like tacacs and radius.
 So normally a technician would plug in the console server to an existing switch (depending on the brand of the switch, i will have to preconfigure the OOB device to connect to it) and the equipments will be accessible via the switch. Normally most devices in the data center have RJ45 compatibility. What do you guys recommend using for this scenario or if you have used those i have listed or a variation of it ? Btw i've searched most on amazon but there isn't much available. Some websites are genuine but don't list the prices which makes it harder. Anyway, let me know what you think.
 Thanks in advance.

 I have qty. 4 /24 ARIN-allocated IPv4 blocks. The internal network is all OSPF routed, ultimately with routes connecting the 2 sites.
 I understand I can manipulate outbound traffic patters with OSPF cost internally- just send that traffic to the router that you want it to go out of.
 But how can I manipulate inbound traffic patterns if I want traffic coming to one of the /24 blocks through one circuit and the other 3 /24's through the other circuit? But at the same time, I want to advertise all 4 blocks to both peers. 
 I know how to AS prepend- but I don't think applicable here. I can only export one route-map per neighbor on each router I think?

We currently have visibility into the rpis, but when those go down, I have to contact the owner of the firewall and inquire about their network status etc which is extremely inefficient. 
 Is there any way/what is the best way (I'm thinking quick and dirty because we have a long term solution coming but no one knows when) for me to monitor these switches without making any changes to the firewall and without installing anything on the raspberrypi (I don't have enough clout to get that pushed through). For example, if the switches support SNMPv3 could I send that? Would other network monitoring tools like Zabbix be able to send traffic from behind the firewall? Does it all just depend on the firewall settings? Also, we have one valid IP address to use on their network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many people starting out in this field I am from a Cisco background, but in my current place we are an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches across each of our campus'. MLAGs are in use everywhere possible including all inter-switch trunk links. MLAGs were completely new to me when I started here, but I initially picked up how they work quite quickly, because I was previously using Multi-Chassis EtherChannel's back when I was operating Cisco 6500's in my last job. Lately though I've been tasked with migrating VLANs from old switches onto new switches, and I've run into problems where I've accidentally caused a loop to form by tagging a VLAN on the wrong trunk, which has royally pissed me off because this should never be allowed to happen. This is all because one of the things I've learnt regards MLAGs, at least where I work, is that we don't run any form of STP where MLAGs are used, because the two technologies do not work well together, which for us, means that STP is not enabled anywhere it should be within our campus LANs. My Cisco background has taught me you should never disable STP, and I completely agree. Why the fuck are we doing it like this? I'm angry and fed up of having my human errors magnified because we aren't running STP when we should. Yes, I know there are newer technologies now like SPB but we aren't going to be ripping up our entire network to change that now, no chance. I'm just really pissed off that this is the way it is.
 Is anyone else here an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches, with MLAGs and STP enabled?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, hoping to get some of that sweet sweet community wisdom on this before I make the point of no return step of Plugging In A Power Cable. Here, I am the end user who knows enough to be dangerous.
 I have a beloved 4port DVI KVM that has served me for 15y+ and has outlived its own, and a replacement generic power supply. The manufacturer gives the spec as "DC5.3V:5.91W:53BTU". This means little to me beyond VxA=W, therefore 1.11509433962 Amp. I don't have a clue what BTU means, I assume it's some sort of pre IEEE British Tickling Unit standard for calculating time/distance/nautical speed/psychological moustache impact.
 So armed with this basic knowledge, I conclude I need a 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp DC power supply of +1 good luck finding that on ebay roll a D6 for No.
 However, the long serving recently deceased 5v generic PSU would suggest there are ranges and tolerances to device power distribution. As did a confusing and in hindsight extremely troubling conversation with my teenage era physics teacher which concluded with "meh, over/undervolt by up to 50% you don't have to get all precious about it". 
 "Sir..", as I was institutionally minded to refer to him as a child of the mid 80s to 90s English school system, "make sense, my autism begs you. It's either 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp on your own GCSE final exam paper, or it's chaos. Please which is it?"
 So my questions is:
 Given that USB is 5v, and fast charging phone PSUs are not limited to the 500mA standard, and I have worked in IT for over two decades and have never thrown anything away, is there a chance I can MacGyver a solution right now in my home after an entire bottle of wine, or at least for less than a fiver on ebay searching for "USB to DC multi connector cable" ?
 ​
 Thank you all in advance.

 I've been a 'computer guy' (tech, sysadmin, what-have-you) for many, many years - (started before GUI OS's hit the consumer market.)
 Since the advent of the GUI desktop Trash Can, I've developed very strong muscle-memory to empty that dumb thing whenever I see stuff in it - and this has bitten me on the butt more than once.
 Just took a phone call from a friend. I had made a (400-mile) road trip to spend a weekend with him last fall and help him upgrade his old Mac Mini to try and get a few more years out of it.
 "Hey - when you were here, you emptied my trash can - can I get those files back? I was keeping some important photos in there I need back now."
 Corollary to the rule above; don't empty other people's trash cans, no matter how much you want to!
 But GEEZ! IT WAS IN THE TRASH!

 There are obvious negatives to the API costs but I got to thinking...so many annoying things are API generated
  
Annoying bots
 
Mass spam
 
Mass Private Messages from 'ladiez who luv to smooch'
 
Automated Karma farming accounts
 
 I wouldn't be sad to see any of these things go with the 'free' API moving to a cost-based API. 
 Would these things still exist with the API changes or would it still be relatively cheap? Would pushing API to a cost-based format reduce spam and bots by a large amount?
 Just curious what the other side of the coin is here, if anyone has any ideas or notions.
 In the end, I think they should charge for the API but it should cost much less or there should be some sort of tiered-based system. What they are charging for now, makes no sense. No one is going to pay the cost so why bother doing it in the first place...unless their idea is to destroy 3rd party apps and pretend it's for monetary reasons.

Our SAN is starting to run out of space and we don't have the money to replace the whole thing at the moment (I can't add nodes because StoreVirtual is discontinued). I am looking for ways to free up some space on the SAN and the prime candidate would be to move our primary file server as it is using 2.75TB of space. The two VMware 5.5 host servers have 5 TB of local RAID as this was originally used for VM storage before we got the SAN. So, I am trying to figure out how to create a HA file server using this empty space. My first idea was to just setup two new VMs and cluster them but that requires shared storage which I don't have. Then I looked at Storage Spaces Direct but that requires some high-end network infrastructure that I don't have. I have looked at trying to setup some sort of mirrored storage in VM directly but I don't see any way to do that. Nor can I add disks from two different hosts to the same VM to do OS based mirroring. My last option is to use DFS Replication but I'm not sure how to do this without shared storage. I would also need to do a standalone namespace because of all the things that point to the existing UNC. Does anyone know if I can do DFS replication across a Windows Cluster or are there any better solutions?

 Currently my plan is something like the following:
  
install (old version) esxi on server 
 upgrade esxi to newer version
 get vmware configured and running (attach a datastore, configure networking, configure VLAN's, configure port aggregation etc.)
 deploy some server VM's and promote 2 to DC's
 configure DHCP and DNS with certain options

The current contract is up at the end of the year, so they’re looking to bring someone in now and give them time to set everything up before the contract ends.
 “They have ~30 end users with MS desktops. I’ll need to establish backup procedures, check run, daily printing and recovery (if needed), manage scanning and indexing of ~1000 documents per day. I’ll manage all the vendors and manage the IT budget.” This is there outline, but I’m not familiar with what all their contractors have done for them. I’m expecting significantly more requirements, esp in the beginning.
 Benefits and WLB are good, but they want to know a salary amount. idek where to start. also, if I take the job, how far in over my head will i be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I shared how I felt and wanted to say thank you for all the comments (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/14b53th/i\_wanna\_be\_a\_goat\_farmer/). Some were funny and others were serious. I appreciate it them all!
 I really thought about a few of the comments like: 
 "Work slower, focus on quality and stop overwhelming yourself."
 "6 months from now no one will care that you’re over working yourself."
 " Fuck it, became a goat farmer, follow your dream my guy."
 It is my fault really for the stress and anxiety. Maybe because I am a bit proud? I think I can do it all!?
 I sat with myself and told myself, I am not a machine. I am a human. I need to have limits for my own sanity. Limits are good. It's ok. Do your best you can. Anything else is either for tomorrow or the company needs more folks. Stop doing the work of 2 and just do you. I feel much better today. Feels like a lot of weight off of my shoulders. Today I came into work, and I told myself out loud: 
 'Do you best. Focus on the quality. If the customer gets angry, let them talk with my manager, and then I'll have that conversation with my manager after. Don't get worked up and stressed. Do a good job and then go home.' Last Friday was bad for me in a very long time. I almost cried because I felt I had nowhere else to go, didn't know who I was, just miserable and lost. Thought I'd never get to this point but there I was. It's good to check in with yourself and realize we work to live and not the other way around. 
 ​
 Anyways, enough of this. Today I learned about Azure Landing Zones! Quite interesting.

 The title is exactly the predicament I'm in. I won't get into explicit details, but I work for a non-profit organization, with a fleet of approximately 1750 computers.
 Unfortunately, the pandemic caused a lot of problems with funding desktop computer replacements. I've recently come on-board in the last 6 months have found that 40% of the systems in our fleet will not meet Windows 11 requirements when it goes out of support in October 2025.
 My biggest issue is I don't believe I have the people-resources or funding to replace all of the systems by that date. I will have the resources to replace some. But there will be stragglers and I'm worried of the security implications when the time comes around. I know there are some obvious solutions to this problem - many …]]></summary>

 ​
 A little bit of background:
 I have a Dell R-series server (RAID1) and on it will be RHEL8. I will be making the current OS into a baseline, but I would like to make it into an ISO so I can keep it as a baseline. The problem is, I don't want a full disk to be used, and make an ISO that is 300GB big. 
 For a temporary solution, I thought of keeping the RAID1, and adding more disks to create another virtual RAID1, then clone over the OS to the other RAID. I haven't gone into research with this yet as I am just drafting up solutions. 
 Another way is what I mentioned above. I thought of using `mkisofs` and `dd` to create a ISO, but I am unsure if that would work properly. 
 ​
 If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them. I am currently a little stuck. Thank you for the help!

 I am wondering if I should try to get the "Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate" as I have "some" training in security, but no documentation of knowledge. I have read this and it looks like the questions in not that hard, https://www.reliablesoft.net/google-cybersecurity-certificate-review
 I have a stable unrelated IT job and no plans to switch to cybersecurity. I think of this most as a "nice to have" cert.
 So I have some questions:
 - Is there anything I has to do besides multiple choice tests?
 - How hard is it?
 - Is the the teaching mostly videos?
 - How many tries do I have on the tests?
 - How fast is it realistically to do this thing?
 I have never used Coursera.
 To be honest cyber security is not the most exciting topic but I recognize that it is an important area to know

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've inherited a network. While creating a network map, I thought I found a loop.
 core <-> switch1 <-> switch2 <-> switch3 <-> core
 I turned on loop protection (logging only) on all the switches part of the loop.
 Only switch2 alerted to the loop.
 Does it matter where I break this loop?

 What kind of simple tools like these would you like to see on a helpdesk assistant?

My boss has recently gotten hot and heavy on the idea of "Digital Experience Monitor" solution to improve the end user experience. While I'm all fpr helpijg the service desk with more tools, and improving viaibility into workstations, we tried it before. 
 About 5 years ago we tried Aternity on a limited engagement and found that the effort required to create application monitoring profiles required significant effort and time that we didn't have. 
 We are an SMB and most of us Admins wear 10+ hats a piece. Most of our critical business apps are in the Autodesk/Bentley space (AEC firm). 
 I love the idea of it, but I dont love the idea of another tool that requires constant management and care. Just curious if anyone has any opinions on it, since its been 5 years since we looked at it ourselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm seeking suggestions for a cost effective backup system suitable for a small office(10 ppl). We have one local file server with a file share available to all employees. Our goal is to backup this folder to the cloud reliably.
 We already use Microsoft accounts, so perhaps an Azure-based solution could work. Our yearly backup data doesn't exceed 100GB, and while high availability isn't necessary, we do need accidental deletion protection and MFA. We'd also appreciate a simple way to access backups from specific dates. 
 I'm struggling with finding exact names of products I need to read about. It appears that for each usage application, there's an entirely distinct product, each with slightly varied names. Here are my current ideas:
 ​
  
Buy windows server 2019 essentials, shared folder is located here => some azure filesync or related software synchronizes this shared folder to an identical fileshare on azure => Some other azure backup <insert one of the many names here> makes backup of it periodically. 
 Ubuntu server with share => some azure thing copies data to azure cloud =>something backs it up there similarly to option 1.
  Linux server with share = > Some other cloud backup solution more suitable for that situation.

 I'm looking in to Intune for MDM etc, I'm new to this and would like some help with clarification. I've come across a few things:
 If a laptop is AD Azure Registered as a device, you cannot join to domain? It appears you can add it in to a policy, but you can't do it on the local machine?
 Policy configurations - Can I completely replace Group Policy distributed by on site DC? Why would I then need it on the domain?
 I feel like I'm missing something. What will I lose if I take Intune over using on-prem? what are the biggest challenges people have faced from going to Intune?
 I feel this one has made me feel really IT dumb for some reason

 So Friday afternoon one of our partner accounts with the role "Privileged Authentication Administrator" ended their agreement as our relationship came to an end. 
 Soon after that any new user account created have been having an error code "AADSTS900561: The endpoint only accepts POST requests. Received a GET request" while trying to setup 2FA for their first login. I can get around this by manually adding their phone number in through their "Auth Methods" area on their user profile as global admin but this obviously isn't sustainable. 
 Any ideas on what setting could have changed? Or just where I can make changes to fix this?

 I am trying to used this MS tool to check some power-shell scripts for PS 7.2+ compatibility, I am having trouble building and exporting a custom profile with this tool, as it does not have the compatibility profile for ps 7.2+ yet https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/using-psscriptanalyzer-to-check-powershell-version-compatibility/ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psscriptanalyzer/?view=ps-modules
 By default this is what is offered
 We need to look under the PSUseCompatibleCommands documentation for a list of profiles available by default. For our desired targets we pick:
 PowerShell 6.1 on Windows Server 2019 (win-8_x64_10.0.17763.0_6.1.3_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core) PowerShell 5.1 on Windows Server 2019 (win-8_x64_10.0.17763.0_5.1.17763.316_x64_4.0.30319.42000_framework) PowerShell 3.0 on Windows Server 2012 (win-8_x64_6.2.9200.0_3.0_x64_4.0.30319.42000_framework)
 I am looking to build a custom profile for a ws2019 with ps 7.2 + to use to check my scripts, i have tried using the compat collector https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/development/PSCompatibilityCollector and running the build.ps1 script there but I do not see an output for my commands and the script text doesn't provide much clarify to me at least.
 Any ideea on how this can be used?

 When the new signing certificate got promoted to "Primary", authentication stopped working for both relaying services until they got updated with the new cert, the old one was still listed as "Secondary" though. I do not have any experience with other SAML providers and therefore do not know if they have similar cert renewal mechanisms and how other relaying partys work with that, but I am guessing that a well-programmed relaying party usually should be able to check for both (the primary and secondary) certificates so that there is a grace period for switching? Or am I totally wrong here? I'd like to bring this up to the service's support if this rollover handling is something they can fix on their side, but as I said, I am unsure if this even is a "bug" or just regular behavior with other partys as well.

 In my Windows 10 domain, we're currently using a piece of software called OPSI to do our application deployment and management. It's not bad but it's a bit complex for admins who lack Linux experience or lack speaking German as most of the diagnostic messages are in German.
 I have been looking into Winget and it seems like a nice solution for us as we could send commands to machines to update all of their software and chuck out new pieces with ease.
 I have been investigating how we can roll out Winget for a while now and have been getting a bit frustrated. As it's a part of the Desktop Installer package which is from the store it can only seemingly be deployed on a 'per user' basis. Google results seem to point me to installing Desktop Installer .appx via dism.exe and whilst the commands are complete, Winget does not seem to be available for any user, Administrator or otherwise.
 Has anybody had any joy deploying Winget into their domains? What was your method?
 Thank you for reading this!

I initially thought well that's why it runs like a pig, which was soon followed by an expression of wonder at how something with that much open source can be wrapped up as a vendors product and sold with the vendors sticker price. On the one hand that seems to be pushing the open source licensing needle towards the abuse end of the meter, on the other, I suppose integrating all those packages takes quite a bit of effort hence the cost.

I've been working on this subject for a few days, and all I want is to create a proper start menu, without all the unnecessary programs such a "Disney+" or "TikTok" to show. I've tried every single things, including Microsoft help pages, forums and more but nothing works : I can't manage to get a layout file for the start menu.
 So has anyone ever worked on this subject and can help me with that? 
 Thanks for reading and have a nice day!

 I attempted to do it via the rules by creating the following rule:
 "VMs listed below SHOULD run on the following hosts" 
 Result:
 I have to pre-migrate the VM to the host and once I kill it the VMs shift around the free hosts, however, once the host comes back up, they do not come back to this host unless I migrate them manually.

 Any ideas on what I can do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I work as a jack of all trades at a small business and I've recently found myself setting up Cisco Duo.
 I was able to get the Duo Authentication Proxy setup and working over LDAPS, but I've been having a rough time getting my (Fortigate) firewall to connect to my Duo Authentication Proxy's radius server. 
 As best I can tell, my firewall and Auth Proxy configurations are correct. The Auth Proxy's validation checker says my setup is good to go.
 I found old posts about Fortigate firewalls not playing nice with Auth Proxies on different network segments. I saw that setting a source ip in the Fortigate firewall might help. No dice. Still fails to connect to my Duo Authentication Proxy's radius server. My IP addresses and secret key are definitely correct. 
 I'm wondering if port 1812 is being blocked by my Fortigate firewall. Per nmap, port 1812 is "filtered" on my server running my Duo Auth Proxy. When I test disabling my Windows Server Firewall and scan again, I'm told port 1812 is closed. I see no obvious firewall rules allowing/blocking port 1812. Would I be correct in deducing that my Fortigate firewall is therefore likely blocking port 1812 on my network?

 Well I get a call the next day to find out they can't access one of the folders on the shared drive but can access all the others. I checked permissons and everything is fine but still can't get in. I thought about disconnecting from the domain tomorrow and then reconnecting and see if that will help. One thing I did notice was the cmd still has the old name attached.

 At my org we are currently using Manage Engine SDP and are trying to move away due to support and performance issues.
 I have narrowed it down to HaloITSM and Fresh Service, I like HaloITSM because it is so flexible and the level of detail you can store in most areas in the system would negate the requirement of having extra documentation.
 Freshservice appears to have very good integrations that work out of the box but simpler and less flexible than HaloITSM.
 I was wondering if anyone has integrated HaloITSM with their RMM tool specifically NinjaOne and what does the integration do? I know it pulls in Asset information, but can you deploy software straight from the helpdesk or initiate remote control? 
 In Freshservice for example the integration with desktop central (currently using but looking at Ninja One) you get an additional box next to your tickets with control options:
 Remote control, System Manage, Power, Wake on LAN.
 ​

 I deploy Adobe Reader to all of my users (700+) via SCCM as a required deployment. These users also have the option of installing Creative Cloud if required (eg for Photoshop, Indesign, Acrobat etc). All users have an active subscription, that includes Adobe Acrobat.
 For some users, when they install and log in to Creative Cloud Desktop, it doesn't always unlock the paid features in Adobe Reader / convert it to Adobe Acrobat (EG Combine PDF files, etc). In cases like this I usually have to uninstall and reinstall Adobe Reader/Acrobat for it to work, whereas with others it just unlocks and asks to install the extra features as soon as a user tries to do something requiring the premium feature. I am using the new unified installer, which is detected correctly as when a user signs into Creative Cloud it lists Adobe Acrobat as installed.
 Any suggestions? I did post on the Adobe forums but have had no response, so figured I would reach out to the community here.

 It may be related to how the patches are being deployed. Seems like if MS is managing you get the second situation, but if it's RMM deployed (regardless of which RMM it seems) it goes into the first screen. 
 Does anyone know what the technical reason for that is? Ninja for example says they use the Windows Update Agent to deploy updates, but then I'd expect it to behave the same as when Windows manages it. 
 It's much less desirable to have them show up in Control Panel, as it just gives a KB number which then needs to be manually verified to be the monthly update. 
 TIA for any light able to be shed on this.

 I want to preface this with saying i've read a lot of other threads on this and know that hiring a pro is probably the easiest and smartest option however it seems like a fairly simple set up and i'd enjoy doing it myself.

 My company is moving into a new office and as the office is currently unpowered, unpainted and unfurnished, they are looking at installing a small office network while they fit it out.
 DETAILS:
 Total employees: 15
 Office Size: 75 m^2
 We have one synology server and are a completely web based business so all our employees use laptops and we are looking to get a couple of dedicated office computers down the line. We will have a printer and probable a VoIP conference room system.
 We use a cloud based service to manage all of our business and semi reguarly are downloading or uploading multi GB files or doing video calls.
 I have looked at basically every online resource there is and have a decent knowledge of network architecture and the different brands in the space. However i am at a loss as to the finer points of which models and combinations of hardware i should go for.
 My biggest gray area is around the modem/router aspect of it. Am currently considering a Fortigate firwall and an Aruba Instant On switch and AP. We are a small business and cheaper would be better but still want to have business grade kit and room to expand in future.
 Any advice is very welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working on a "universal" package management solution for my machine as of late that extends beyond just software and includes as many various possible "installs" I could think of, including but not limited to:
  
Windows Updates and Optional Features
 Winget, Scoop, Chocolatey
 PowerShell Modules (PowerShellGet/PSResourceGet)
 Python Versions via pyenv and packages via pip
 Node Versions via nvm and packages via npm
 R Versions via "rig" and packages via pak
 Terraform versions, providers, and modules
 Cloud CLI Extensions (azure-cli, aws-cli, and gcloudsdk)
 WSL Distro and in turn their (apt/brew) packages
 VSCode Extensions
 GitHub CLI Extensions
 Git Extensions/extras scripts
 Office/Excel Addins (VBA or VSTO)
 Espanso Packages and Auto Hotkey scripts
 Obsidian.md Community PlugIns
 Docker Containers and Docker Desktop Extensions
 Portable (unavailable on package managers) executables (i.e. Manually installed, unzipped exes in ~/bin)
 Rust, Ruby, Golang, Julia, etc globally (user) installed packages
  
Which leads me to my problem: I need a solidified manner to imement BROWSER EXTENSIONS into this module.
 Currently I am using the registry to force extension installations using their unique IDs and the key associated with chrome or edge. Firefox/non-chromium browsers I have working already. 
 However withough the pre-knowledge of knowing the extensions name and ID there is not a way to allow a user to install or search for an extension outside of the marketplace sites. 
 Another issue is the simple fact that this approach makes the browser "managed by the admin" and locks in extensions. 
 Anyone know of a better way? 
 (Not group policy or using whitelist and blacklists cause that's the same thing - the point is for the "user" to manage their extensions, not some ephemeral "admin")

 ​
 I'm trying to figure out if there is a better way to do this function, Currently when we build servers we manual set a static IPv4 address and DNS server on the OS level. 
 Now I'm going to have a project coming soon to upgrade and replace the DC controllers which are where the DNS server point to the pair. Now I know we can powershell and update all the windows servers to change there DNS servers,
 My question is is the above method still the sane way people do it now days with some automation tools or do we do somthing at the vcenter host level or switch level to just go these are the DNS servers so only a few place need to be updated ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BACKGROUND:
 I'm using https://toolbox.googleapps.com to set up email for a domain. Mostly to see why people who register for my website get the following orange warning message when my website sends an email to a new user:
 ​
  
Be careful with this messageUserName has never sent you messages using this email address. Avoid replying to this email unless you reach out to the sender by other means to ensure that this email address is legitimate.
  
The email my website sends to new users who register is coming from "[UserName@MyWebsite.com](mailto:UserName@MyWebsite.com) via gcam1123.siteground.biz". (The "1123" is a fake number I just made up in case that could identify my website in this Reddit post. It's not a bad site, I just don't want to be accused of promoting my website).
 THE PROBLEM:
 I'm using Google Workspaces to handle the email and the website is hosted on a shared hosting server (SiteGround).
 When I test my domain in Google Admin Toolbox, I get the following error message:
 "There should not be a mail exchanger set up on naked domain name."
 ​
  
Presence of mail server on A record of your domain can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug problems with mails 'accidentally' missing in case of DNS problems. You can check this problem yourself by typingtelnet your.doma.in 25Normally this SHOULD result in 'Connection refused' message.
  
​
 How can I fix this?
 Do I just delete the mail.MyWebsite.com. "A" record? (I used the word "MyWebsite" in place of my domain for this example).

 thank you

 Sometime, shit doesn't even work-
 I can recall so many times when I clicked the windows key and the menu doesn't appear or try to open settings/windows apps that it'll either be super slow or doesn't even pop up at all.
 Sometimes Bluetooth just cuts out and stops working until I restart my PC. It is just becoming a pain now, but compared to Linux, Windows 10 is shitty & unreliable.
 And no I don't have malware (trojans, viruses, etc). Even after a clean install of windows, the shit still doesn't work sometimes.
 I remember working on laptops that had the windows 10 os and it being glitchy here and there. 
 Even resetting the firmware, re-imaging the computers, downloading drivers, and so much more there are still so many bugs. I looked at every setting, every GPO, everything that could cause it.. 
 Does anybody have this issue?

 So what makes you excel in this area? I am pretty sure I don't do anything exceptional or out of the ordinary. However I found out in the past few years that I am good at talking to people or as they say I have a goos "social skill". The amount of IT people who lacks it is too damn high as they simple don't know how to talk to another person. 
 Most of the times they are rude without even meaning it, or they don't know how to explain something that is quite simple for us but not for the user, and more often then not they say: "you really don't know that, that's basic". Users hate this sentence! 
 So, what makes you excel? Share your skills with others that might be struggling to succeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We're a small company with one site and about 30 servers but for DR we only need about 10 servers including a file server.
 At the moment we just replicate these servers to 3rd party with Zerto. For various reasons we may need to replace this 
 I was thinking of the following as a replacement:
 Put a Domain Controller in our Azure tenant. This would be a full time DC using a site to site VPN to our onsite. So it should provide redundancy and remove the need to replicate domain controllers
 Use Azure File Sync for our main file server. Staff would still access the on prem server but we would have a cloud copy for DR and could spin up a new server and point it at this if needed.
 Use Azure Site Recovery for the other servers we need
 I think this gives us some flexibility and redundancy.
 Any thoughts on the above?

 I have been given the task to onboard our On-prem servers into Azure Defender for Cloud (P2 license) I succesfully connected some servers and Defender has been installed.
 I was just wondering: What is the best recommended way to manage Defender on these servers, like create exclusions for groups of servers, or to force a full scan every now and than etc. 
 Do I have to onboard the servers in Intune? Or? Is there anyone that maybe can kick me into the right direction or has some good websites that explain how this must me archieved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have an interesting one here and its breaking my brain a little bit. I won't lie, I'm not the biggest networking guy out there. So I ask this question with many question marks in my mind.
 ​
 Part 1:
 I have PFSense firewall setup with 4 different IPSec tunnels running in place with no issue.
 Two of these tunnels are going to other PFSense boxes - no issues
 One is going to a SonicWall - no issues
 The last one is going to a edge router. - no issues yet
 ​
 Part 2: no issues yet
 Attaches another Edge router to the pfsense - no issues yet
 We now have 5 vpns in action.
 ​
 Part 3:
 VPN is created between the two edge routers - to each other - along with the vpn back to the pfsense box.
 Once the tunnel is created between the Edge Routers - the vpns from both boxes drop to the pfsense box. Remove the VPN tunnel from one of the edge routers and that edge router reconnects back to the pfsense box. Re add the VPN and the connection drops.
 ​
 We have tested each VPN separately and all works fine. Its like - once a edge router talks to another edge router, it kills all non-edge router connections. Very odd. 
 ​
 So my thinking is there is some type of limitation in the edge os that is causing this issue. Has anyone seen this issue before?
 Thanks,
 Kyle

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a doctors office. We want a Hipaa compliant app where our employees can text and call patients from their personal phone and obscure their numbers. Some specific criteria:
 1) Only the Employee needs to install the App (or maybe visit a web link) to call (audio or/and+or video) and text. The patient can receive calls/texts like normal on their phone without having the app installed.
 2) The Employee can make the call over Wifi OR their Carrier and still have it be encrypted. This is just in case their wifi is not strong enough.
 So far, we've narrowed down Iplum as the best compared to many popular ones. But the only issue with Iplum: the patient needs to have the app installed in order to receive text messages.
 Does anyone have any input? I feel like it’s kind of specific but figured I’d ask. Thanks for any answers
 Vsee is BAA agreeing but their free messaging protocol does not offer HIPAA compliance. Doxy.me and pMD look good but im looking for all alternatives possible to expand my scope. Thank you in advance, again!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I’ve recently discovered that all of our AVD images (win10 multi session) have a lot of questionable software installed on them from our previous MSPs before I started with the company. They’ve left a huge mess and installed Sql, python, ODBC, and basically a bunch of crap, with no GPOs, no locked down services or drive re-direction blocked, it’s basically a giant disaster. In addition, they set the VM session count limit to 20, with 32 gig ram and 8 cpu per VM. 
 Firstly, I think the specs are way overkill, would you agree here? 
 Second, the amount of bloat software on these VMs seems a bit ridiculous to me. A design to have non-persistent VDIs, regardless if they are RDSH or win10, should really not even have SQL, python, ODBC, and all this junk on there, that is designed physical endpoints or persistent VDIs. 
 Thirdly, I spun up a few hardened VDIs with a baseline image, 2 CPU, 8 gig ram. Someone decided to upgrade all of my persistent VDIs to 4 cpu & 16 gig ram, because “users were complaining”, because they are Power Users that use SQL, PBI, etc. 
 while azure monitor clearly shows a lack of resources even being used. 
 Am I going crazy here? Thoughts?
 I’m thinking about redoing the multi-session gold image from scratch and doing it the right way. Rather than keeping whatever non sense this MSP did.

 Big customer with a big contract wants us to install their own VPN and certificate on one of our corporate devices in order to facilitate accessing documentation on their network. Part of this involves the VPN checking for device compliance (virus, firewall, encryption).
 The whole thing seems a bit old school, but they are a very big global customer so I don't think we have much room to find an alternative.
 Can anyone think of reasons NOT to do this? Or reasons why this is safe to do? Any alternatives we might suggest?

 I have a number of Cisco SD-WAN images in the cloud, a list of the EC2 IDs, and a list of the router serial numbers. I am trying to figure out a way to programmatically figure out the correct association between the two lists.
 The best idea we have so far is to add hostname and IP address fields to each report and compare those, but I’m worried that is not a safe design for a global enterprise where ip addresses can be reused in different geographies.
 Open to other ideas as well. Ultimately trying to hopefully find that one system contains a list of the other’s unique identifier.

We’re salaried and our 9-5 is now officially 8-5 on paper, because they want that extra hour to account for our unpaid breaks. My boss says that he doesn’t expect us to do 12-16 hr days like him but he “likes to lead by example in that regard.” 
 On top of that, I’m being assigned 9 hours of project work + 3 hours of my normal duties a day. I’m struggling to find time to even take a piss let alone a 30 min. lunch and two 15 minute breaks… I missed my psychologist appointment staying late at work incurring a $150 charge the next day coupled with a mental break down.
 They continue to drop projects on me at the end of business hours that need to be completed immediately and I can’t leave until I’ve delivered results.
 The workload has increased ten fold. My quality of work is dropping as a result. I’m drowning. We’re approaching mass failure.
 I’ve started revamping the resume and shooting it out to those in my network.
 I’m just really bummed. I was invested in the work I had on my plate. But if I can’t do that work well because I’m too spread thin, I don’t want to put my name on it.
 Is there anything I can do about the new culture shift?
 Has anyone ever successfully convinced leadership that a workload is unsustainable and counter productive?
 Or should I cut my losses and dip?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. I’m a new sys admin at company that just got rid of their senior sys admin a month before I joined up. We’ve got 4 rack servers all operating as hypervisors and a storage server(Synology NAS with a bunch of HDDs). 4 LUNs were created on top of these drives and each LUN was mapped via iSCI to each hypervisor, all the VMs boot and run from these LUNs. Also got a Microtik cloud router switch that connects all the Hypervisors to the storage server(1Gbps connections). 
 My question: is this an optimal set up, having multiple VMs on each host sitting on LUNs? Is it best practice? If not how may I possibly improve it? I’m willing to rebuild everything from the ground up if I have to. Any suggestions would be appreciated! And yes I definitely plan to reach out to experienced sys admins to help with doing the actual set up but figured I’d also see what y’all think about this. 
 P.S During a recent power issue on one of the hosts I realized that all the VMs lost connection to the storage server and for some reason the iSCI connection kept hanging without reconnecting.. this wouldn’t even be an issue if I was running the VMs locally (buts that’s just my reasoning anyway)

 We are looking at building a new building, and as part of it, I wanted to add conduit for both CenturyLink Fiber, Comcast, and a local fiber company in our area. 
 Total combined pricing I got was 120k
 Comcast was 20k CenturyLink fiber was 65k (somewhat understandable, as their fiber drop is on the far end of the 5acre property) Local fiber company was 35k (requires boring under the street as their is no aerial lines going over the road) 
 Does anyone have alternative options? Can we hire our own private utility install company?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm curious what is the general consensus regarding the preferred underlay routing protocol to use in an ip fabric network that is made of 300+ switches ?
 From what i've gathered using a IGP like OSPF seems like the easiest choice given how simple it is to deploy and it would allow you to use ip unnumbered interfaces which reduces the complexity of the deployment. However you would end up with LSA floods anytime there is a topology change, but maybe that is no longer a big deal since switch CPUs and memory have become more powerful nowadays.
 On the other hand there is BGP it's less "noisy" allows for better administrative control of the underlay network, however it would increase the complexity of the network configuration although that might not be a big deal thanks to network automation tools.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted this r/intune but figured I'd put it here as well in case anyone can offer some insight: 
 I have a hybrid environment with a fair few devices. I put 30 Windows 10 devices in an Update Ring for W11 but only 11 of them seemed to upgrade. All the devices were on and syncing with Intune.
 I had the Active time set as 08:00 to 18:00 so updates should automatically occur outside of those hours, right?
 I even had "Restart Checks" set as "Skip" since these are desktops (No worries about battery) and some of my users only "Lock" their PC and do not actually Sign Out. I wasn't sure if this would be detected as "User Presence" or not.
 The next day, I actually manually dialled into some of the PCs and did "Check for Updates" and the W11 update was there (Along with the Cumulative one for some but not all) and started installing and I was prompted to restart to finish the installation.
 The pie chart on the overview page isn't much help. It only shows there were errors with 4 of the PCs but upon clicking it, it shows each of the four devices on there twice, once as "System Account" once as the UPN of a user (I suspect the last ones to log in on the device). For the record, none of the devices have a primary user set on Intune. It even says "Succeeded" for each of the devices even though they were still on Windows 10.
 Any idea what I'm doing wrong here?
 Also, is the actual "Downloading" of the update happening outside of the active hours as well? In an ideal world, I'd want the update to Download/Install (Same as when you do "Check for Updates") during active hours while the user is logged in (To save on time), I'd just want the force restart to happen outside of Active Hours or if the user chose to do "Update and Restart" or "Update and Shutdown". Not too fussed about this however for now since I'm only deploying this to 9-5 users but will eventually have to deploy it to PCs that are used 24/7 with only random 1-2 hour breaks in between use.

 I'm trying to escape a poor on-prem environment where putting it in a tier 3 data center moves the internet connectivity to being the weakpoint but takes away most of the building/infrastructure type issues that I'm facing but can't fix as I don't own the building and even then it would cost hundreds of thousands to put right.
 I keep being told colo is dead (mostly by people trying to sell me public or private cloud) but I figure physical kit like NAS boxes and servers and VPN boxes still have to go somewhere and they won't disappear overnight.
 Kind of feels like having 1/2 a rack in a tier 3 DC with good redundant connectivity fixes so many of those issues.
 Am I a dinosaur for thinking this?

Any way, I received a call this week, one of her employees was unable to sign into of the MAC computers, she passed me the phone over to her employee, I asked her, do you know what your username and password is supposed to be, and she gave me wrong credentials of course. Anyway, this MAC is unmanaged, (I’ve been trying to convince my team to invest on an MDM), and we were unable to log her in. I asked her to pass me back to her boss, and I spoke with her, asked her to please log in with her credentials, and she told me she doesn’t know it, she can’t. Im going crazy in my head lol. She then goes on a rant on how it’s stupid she can’t login to her own computer and that the IT company should be responsible for remembering everyone’s password blah blah blah, any way this continues for 20 minutes, and then randomly she goes ok I am in. I asked her how, and she nonchalantly says, oh I just logged in as myself. 🤦🏻‍♂️. Any way I was able to take care of the issue pretty quickly after that. Anyone have similar experiences?

 i know there is: auto elevate, admin by request, threat locker, connectwise screenconnect has a module now, the new intune addon suite has it (not sure if it's a windows 11 exclusive), i think cyberark has a tool, and there are many more im sure.
 what else is out there? what are you using, are you happy with it? what do you recommend? how much is it costing you? we are in need of a solution to mange this long term and looking at what is out there and of course in the current financial climate budgets are not unlimited so cost is a factor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I connected to a company guest wifi 2 times. I visited some websites among them 2 records client IPs and country of the IP in the security logging page in users account.
 The astonishing thing to me that both websites recorded wrong country (not my current country) associated with the IP ??
 x.x.x.x is the public IP of the company guest wifi i'm connecting to. It is my country IP ownership and I verified that online and it's true 100%
 The problem is both websites recorded the same wrong country in the security logging page in my account.
 WIFI IP == x.x.x.x , Ownership Country = My Country --> Recorded Country from both websites == Other Country (the same country recorded in both websites).
 What's happening here if I they use vpn/proxy i should see the Other Country in any ip geolocation website but, it was not the case and they show my country as owner of x.x.x.x (and it's true thing) but how they disguised my country for the websites i'm visiting?

 We have around 1/3 of our laptops as Lenovo. But many are using Dell Dock instead Lenovo dock station. This against my advice.
 With Lenovo Commercial Vantage (LCV), seem LCV is trying to detect the dock and patch are failing. I asked the tech connecting to a Lenovo dock and LCV was able installing the fix and other fix did appear.
 This week, 2 laptop using Dell dock failed rebooting Windows 10 after flashing the BIOS. We ended resetting the computer and one did not even reboot after that. Not sure if it is because the laptop were using Dell Dock.
 Anyone would like sharing his experience?
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 As a bit of background, I work in a university research lab and was tasked with planning out a system that could emulate short haul networks using amplitude modulated transceivers (we're doing work with multi-core fiber and spatial division multiplexing). 
 Ideally i'm looking for a system configuration that would enable the use of multiple different QSFP28 transceivers to just send out PRBS traffic that we couple into our channels, but i'm not exactly sure if there's an easy way to get this up and running. In the past I've worked with QSFP-DD and OSFP transceivers that had internal PRBS engines, but I don't know if this is standard for QSFP modules or if that would be a standard feature on the PHY's in a switch, and I'm still trying to parse the CMIS standard.
 Would it be as easy as just getting a switch like the FS S8550-6Q2C, and some different 1310 and 1550nm QSFP modules, or would it have to be done using multiple QSFP28/+ Evalboards?
 I apologize if this is off topic, but we're trying to emulate an enterprise network at layer 1 so I hope it's allowed, and i'll try to answer any questions to clarify things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 As you may have guessed, I have a laptop where I have windows 11 and arch linux Installed in dual boot mode. This is nice and worked well for me until recently.. I need something that can scale, reprovisioned quickly, and has direct hardware access (GPU abd PCI devices).
 My laptop has pretty good specs (16 cores, 32Gb memory, and 2 TB storage one M.2 SSD and one SATA SSD).
 I want the 2 systems to share one partition as a data partition. For example i can store virtualbox VMs on that partition and be able to use these VMs on both windows and linux.
 I am currently reinstalling both systems to clean them up because I was installing alot of programs and stuff to learn and it is now too much to be cleaned, I also neee to repartition the drives with different sizes, but its not fun at all, takes alot of time and effort.
 SO, I was thinking that I can use my laptop as a virtualization server (with proxmox for example) and install both my systems as VMs and have all the advantages that proxmox offers with managing these VMs and their resources). But I am not sure how user friendly will this be for me, and what are the limitations of such architecture? 
 I appreciate any suggestions or if you have other good ideas for my setup, this might become a thing in the future :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We have a 2019 rds we connect to in the office, printer have however been a nightmare, we use hp m400 series with 2 trays and a Ricoh MFD.
 Are printers are set to have sleep mode disabled so it's not adding additional time waking up.
 Using easyprint it's so slow 20 seconds for one page document to print.
 We are using the hp universal pcl 6 driver locally.
 We tried loading the driver on the rds and changed the policy to use the driver first if matched then easy print. 
 While this has reduced our printing time to 3 seconds it doesn't retain any print settings so tray assignments are automatic instead of set and duplex (double sided printing) setting doesn't carry over and work.
 After doing some testing here is what the numbers look like
 Printing using easy print
 Click print - job sent to printer queue on the rds, stays there for 10-12 seconds, sends the job to the local machine takes around 4-5 seconds to send and then another 5 - 8 seconds for the job to physically print.
 Printing using matching Drivers
 Click print - job sent to printer queue on the rds 1-2 seconds, sends to local Machine 1-2 seconds, Physically prints out 3-4 seconds. But doesn't retain any local printer settings.
 Has anyone got a solution for easyprint? Or does anyone know of a way we can carry over the local print settings when using the matching driver?
 We have looked at importing the printer registry keys on the rds so it retains settings but heard this can be a nightmare and not reliable.

 The amount of times that new users join and can't understand how a dual monitor setup works, straight up scares me!
 "So If I want to type on the big laptop, do I need a second keyboard?" (Laptop referring to the extra monitor)
 "I'm opening a file but it opens on my OTHER laptop, I can't work like this!" (Drag and drop works wonders)
 "OK I drag and drop from one monitor to the other, where does the file get saved?" (Please kill me)
 "My computer isn't working... I set up as I do every morning but the mouse doesn't go to the second computer. I have to pull the mouse in the opposite direction to get it on the big COMPUTER.." (user decided to switch the laptop position randomly) 
 I have written user guides, provide a tutorial when a new joiner comes, explain how it works and how it should he used but I still get these questions daily even from staff that has been there a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a customer who is purchasing a large order of branch routers and requires configuration before shipping. They have a project where they need static public IP addresses for I think 12,000 devices. They've determined that port forwarding is not an option and of course there is no way to get that many IPv4 addresses. Problem is, the device we have to ship for whatever reason does not do automatic prefix delegation properly. Even if I manually configured router advertisements using the ISP's statically assigned network prefix, it still doesn't route properly.
 After a week of back and forth, finally engineering admits that the product doesn't support prefix delegation for the LAN side and that the only way to configure this is to use NAT66. I'm well aware of how NAT66 works and I'm aware that it serves no purpose in the IPv6 world. I agree that thinking NAT improves security is just silly.
 With all that out of the way, unfortunately I don't have any other options and we have to ship these routers out as working to the customer. I've read the RFC and seen some of the potential negatives of this, but I wanted to see if anyone has a real world scenario where a NAT66 deployment failed or caused issues. I don't know exactly the specifics of what this customer is deploying. Only thing they said was that they wanted 12,000 devices behind a gateway to have a static public IP address.

There has been absolutely zero policy or procedure for the past 20 years, and as a result everything is a mess. There is no coordination and the sysadmins spend their time fighting with each other about priorities. Systems are all inconsistently configured. it's a mess. But they're paying me quite well and I'm up for a challenge.
 However reading on here, and dealing with these guys at the new company, it's amazing how just absolutely resentful people are about structure, policy and procedure. 
 Most of the guys I work with think there needs to be policy and procedure, but each of them think their version is what everyone else should follow.
 I'm developing standards, and giving them opportunities for input, but they'r fighting me the whole way. A lot of it is stuff people here probably would think is reasonable: building machines from standard templates, using a password database, scripting out common tasks.
 I'm going to get what I need one way or another even if it means a lot of these people have to find other jobs, but it truly is fascinating watching people fighting common sense, hard.
 The usual "this will make your life better" and "we will create a more stable environment so you guys are not on call so much" doesn't seem to help with this crowd. It is definitely an interesting situation.
 I'm doing my best to lead people down the right path, but eventually I'm going to have to switch to an authoritarian leader who gives orders if all else fails here.

 I’ve inherited an environment which has Trellix/McAfee on all win10 workstations.
 My first impression was everything was so much slower.. so I did some benchmarking against just having defender on.. whether it’s boot up time, slow UI and even trying to tab through options in power shell..
 We only have real time scanning on, no schedules, and none of the options in policies seem to be out of place. 
 Sadly I can’t push to switch right now, so I have to try and make it better.. documentation and the McAfee support team haven’t been much help. 
 So I’m looking for tips and tricks to maintain security but improve the general performance. And it’s mainly just within the OS itself (Win10 22H2 Enterprise monthly). Are there any OS processes I need to exclude from scanning or anything?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[my main firewall is pfsense (FW1). i have made a separate vlan and port to connect to a lab firewall opnsense (FW2).
 i want FW2 to work the same as FW1 with no double natting, remote access etc.
 does this look correct?
  
on FW1 add gateway that points to FW2
 on FW1 add static route with destination network being the lan address of FW2 and gateway being the same as the one i setup in step 1.
 on FW2 . . . firewall -> nat -> outbound . . . click the button for no nat.
 on FW2 manually delete all nat rules
 make sure FW2 is the default route to FW1 ???
 on FW2 add an any-any rule.

 We use JAMF to monitor these Macs...well the other day, one of the users Teams me in a panic..."I can't use my mouse!" on the login screen.
 As I am talking to the user, the berating begins..."Why can't you fix this? JAMF is messing up my machine, this software is bullshit. Me and (Other Mac User) are always having problems now since this was installed." on and on it goes....
 Solution? Told her to use her keyboard and she was able to login and mouse worked just fine. Next day and day after, mouse works just fine.
 During this persons rant, I asked "What other issues are you experiencing?" Answer: "I don't have time to get into that."
 THEN I CAN'T HELP YOU, STOP BASHING THE IT DEPARTMENT!
 This person is known for flying off the handle, especially towards the IT staff, and I don't know how many more talks they need to have from their supervisor.
 I'm tired of dealing with abusive users and nothing being done about it.

But when I try to access it from outside it doesn't work, even from a machine within the same subnet. I am not expert in Enterprise networking, so I am not sure if there could be a firewall or any other network security device that could be blocking this traffic within the subnet... any ideas? I tried installing this software in a Windows virtual machine and a Linux as well, same result. It may be worth nothing that I can reach the machine by ping, ssh and such with no issues. Thanks. EDIT: Turns out there was a built-in firewall after all. I stopped it (systemctl stop firewalls) and the issue was gone. Thank y'all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are planning to retire our existing Meraki network stack and replace it with Aruba gear in the coming year and am looking for some advice on my network setup.
 Right now we're running two MS320s as our collapsed core (one in use, other is just idle and relying on RSTP to failover) with five MS220s for access, two VLANs, minimal QoS, so pretty bog-standard network.
 What I'm thinking to move forward with is two Aruba 6300Ms for core, then five 6100Ms for access. I know the 6100s don't stack, but with 100 users and ~160 devices, I don't think it's going to be that unmanageable. 
 Once hardware is in, no immediate plans to do anything fancy, maybe reconfigure the VLANs a bit, but otherwise nothing special.
 What is everyone's experience on the 6100 and 6300 lines and any reason I should be looking at 6200s instead?

 I inherited a mess of a network and am looking for advice on improving it.
  
Today: 
 192.168.0.0/22
 No VLAN configuration of any kind.
 
 Planned: 
 VLAN 10 (Primary LAN) - 10.10.10.0/23
 VLAN 20 (Internal Wifi) - 10.10.20.0/23
 VLAN 30 (Voice) - 10.10.30.0/24
 VLAN 40 (Guest) - 192.168.40.0/24
 
  
DHCP for VLANs 10-30 will be managed on a Windows server. VLAN 40 will have DHCP handled either by the router or the Unifi controller. I lean toward having the router handle it, but am open to suggestions.

More work is thrown at me, and expectations are high. Customers emailing me constantly for updates, but I don't have time to research since I am trying to meet these god damn SLA's which my response quality has lowered significantly. So new clients are not getting my best, current clients want their stuff to be fixed NOW and each day I am stressing knowing I am bound to get more new work. I'm tired. I asked for a few days off in July a couple weeks ago, all of it denied. 
 I enjoy working in the cloud, and scripting but I am getting burned out and I feel it. I feel so much stress. I struggle to sleep. I've always had my shit together, but each day I feel like I am losing control. I don't even get paid much for the stuff we do and am willing to go back to help desk with a lower pay for now, just no more stress. Hell, I even applied for simple sale's jobs. I don't know what to do anymore to be honest. Market also sucks kind of. Been getting interviews and make it to the last round but always get the 'We have decided to move forward with other better candidates. Good luck'. I want to quit so bad, but I only have enough money to get me through the next 3 months without working. Should I quit, and just get a simpler job for now for cash flow, while I patiently apply elsewhere?

My senior that does all the actual complicated admin work operates remotely and is notoriously difficult to contact. As a result, much of the work is done by me when it really shouldn’t be. I’m in school, but lack a lot of formal training. I’m more or less just the “guy that knows computers”.
 A user reported to me that their HP printer did not work. This is a printer that only this one user uses, and has never had any issues before. I try to print and the computer says there isn’t even a printer connected, so I look and it’s not showing on the network. I add it directly by ip, but jobs still won’t leave the queue. So I check the printer itself and it can print a test page just fine when I do it from the printer. I figure it’s a driver issue, so I get the newest drivers from HP’s site and it finally works!
 The problem comes when I report to my senior that I solved the issue and how I did it. This kind of thing usually does not get a reply from him. However this time he called me on the phone, which is SUPER out of character. He sounds super angry. He tells me that “printer drivers haven’t changed in 40 years.” And that we just needed to “direct the traffic properly next time.” He goes on to explain to me that this was a “big no no” and that future printer concerns should be directed to him.
 Where did I go wrong here? Like I said I’m not formerly trained, but I’ve never once heard anyone ever say that there was an issue with just getting drivers from the official source for a printer. I also did not really understand what he meant by directing the traffic.

 Brand new StoreEasy 1660 will not boot into Windows server 2019 IOT setup.
 Detailed all of the information in my case, including screenshots.
 HP Support sent me this... my responses in bold
 Could you please provide details:
  
Current OS on the unit - The current OS should be windows server 2019 IOT that is included with the HP Store easy product.
 
What are we trying to achieve - I am attempting to deploy this brand-new NAS to my environment, and it will not boot into the windows installation provided by HP via factory install. I detailed this in the case.
 
Error you are getting? - I attached a screenshot of the error I am getting in the case. Basically, the server finds the windows bootloader, and it errors out the windows installation before I can do anything with the server. It then reboots when I click OK and goes to the same error again.
 
 HP Support then sends me a tool where I have work work with a CAB file that the tool makes. OK great, boot into windows, use their tool and send them the file they need for analysis... 
 Except I can't boot into Windows!!!
 Working with level 2 they want me to download the recovery media... I understand that the recovery media will probably solve the issue, reinstall Windows Server 2019 and I'll be good to go. Issue is, the link they sent shows the product no longer active in HPE's Software Center.
 Running SUM right now to run all updates to firmware, etc and I'm stuck on the localhost self inventory of the HDD firmware... for an hour and a half.
 I have a call at noon with the support engineer, and of course I'll be nice to them but seesh.

Our room controllers operate on a loop topology just daisy chaining one device to another to another etc, until it reaches EOL, and then the last device loops back to the floor switch creating a loop that is protected by the RSTP. This is just to have that small amount of redundancy in case 1 device or cable fails, we should still see the others on the network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning all, Im hoping this is a quick and easy question.
 Im fully in the Intune world, and really having good luck with it over the last year and a bit. With that, we allow BYOD devices, which is also working great.
 Up to this point, we have only allowed enrolment for phones that the organization was paying for, either outright bought and paying monthly for, or compensating some amount directly to the employee.
 It's never actually come up, weirdly, until yesterday. Our policy for BYOD doesnt address this, so we might want to get that changed.
 In my opinion, if the user wants their work email on their phone, and willing to download and install the profile, it's secure, and therefore good in my books - who's phone is or is not being paid for is not mine to manage.
 I thought I would reach out to the hive mind and see if that aligns with others as well.
 ​
 edit: haha, BYOB. Seems that came off the fingers a little too easy. I mean BYOD. Oy.

 I was hoping I could get some help getting BGP (with BIRD2) configured correctly, as I'm experiencing weird bugs and I was hoping some more experienced network engineers could maybe help me out and save me hours of troubleshooting haha!
 We have a few VMs at Vultr, and the setup that kinda works so far is to add a single /128 IPv6 address to the Debian /etc/network/interfaces file on the primary interface [ens3] - just like we would for the Vultr assigned IPs, and then I'm using the following BIRD2 configuration file to advertise the larger /48 prefix that the /128 is part of:

 What I am trying to setup:
 Printers client gpo, with default printer.
 Printers users gpo, for those who roam the facility.
 ​
 Printers client gpo: 
 I've done it, it works, set it to replace, apparently never fails to connect the printer and it's actually default.
 ​
 Printer users gpo:
 I've had mixed results, very often we receive complaints abut missing printers ( a simple gpupdate recconnects them) and this is super annoying, both for us and the users.
 To mitigate this behaviour we tried to place a "delete all" action as first action.
 This improved the situation, bur never really solved it.
 ​
 We want to autoremove a printer from a user, if she/he changes department.
 Replace, caused reconnecting o deploy issues, the above method too.
 Update action just updates the printer, does not remove it.
 ​
 How do you actually approach this situation?

 The problem with this is that it blocks the new web based client. Naturally I turned to CA policies and created one which successfully blocks access to Outlook in every medium except the official clients (this policy affects teams over the web as well, but that's ok with the company). 
 The real problem is that blocking exchange online in CA also block Microsoft Forms, which our HR uses a lot. I tried excluding MS Forms in my policy but this didn't work. Has this happened to any of you guys and if so, how did you manage to overcome it? Sadly, MS learn pages don't seem to provide a clear solution.

 This year the certificate was expiring so I arranged with the support provider to install a new certificate. I asked for the TXT record to verify ownership and was met with confused responses. It turns out they just asked GoDaddy for a renewal and they issued a brand new certificate for another year on the same domain. 
 To be clear, I've removed the TXT record from last year, so there is nothing to verify that I'm still the owner of the domain. 
 I highlighted with the support company that this is scary that GoDaddy would issue a certificate without renewing the proof but was told I'm wrong and overreacting.

 We have a conditional access policy in place, designed intentionally to block all applications except for a select few exclusions. 
 The reason we are blocking everything down and opening up for specific applications in Conditional Access is because the user is a local admin on these clients and therefore we assume that the client are "compromised". And because of that we have hardened applications/resources that are made available for the user / client. 
 We are facing an issue with the sign-in Office applications (word, excel, powerpoint etc) and MS Edge profile sign-in. The problem is not due to this overall policy, but rather the difficulty we are having in correctly identifying and adding the required resources for these specific applications to the exclusion list.

 I intend on using the 3750 as kind of a collapsed core and access switch.
 I have to take this setup abroad to where the office is but have never setup a network from scratch... All be it a small simple setup like this.
 I suppose my question is, does that brief description sound possible?
 I will be setting up VLAN interfaces and subnets , about 5 VLANs, setting up 'ip routing ' on the switch and setting the Draytek as the default gateway.
 Can I expect issues with that setup?

 I want to automate Outlook signature creation for users. We use MS Office 2021 Standard and Exchange Server 2019.
 I have made PS script which replaces data in .HTM template and puts it in Signature folder for each user in GPO. Then it calls Outlook.exe to apply signature for user.
 The problem is - my signature is made in MS Word as table with text and images. Images are hosted at imgbb and placed in HTM code. When i open Outlook and apply signature it says that it cannot load images from the source.
 My suggestion is that Outlook is blocking external links with some security policies or it cant handle images as links when applying signature to Outlook.
 My questions are:
 1) What can i do to make images work without creating other files/folders rather than .HTM file? I have tried manually replace images in code with base64 encoding but it didnt help. Maybe i can generate HTM signature template with some external services.
 2) Is there any other way to generate signature for Outlook users? I dont want to use transport rules at Exchange server because i dont know how to generate specified signature with user data (name, surname, phone number) in one rule.

 At the moment we are running a mix of brocade and cisco that will need to be replaced, across several stacks that are quite old.
 I'm thinking of deploying some Cisco 940X switches instead of 9300 switch stacks.
 We currently use 2X 9407R's In our datacentre in a collapsed core configuration and they have been rock solid since being in production. Can't really say the same for our other Cisco 9300s stacks around the place
 Everything on the floor would be 1G except for the uplinks to the switches in the datacentre.
 Would be around 240 odd ports, so would be 2 9300 switch stacks in 3 vs the chassis switch with 2 supervisor modules
 Would there be any huge differences with one over the other?
 The uplink to our datacentre will be the same either way with 2 ports going to core switch

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have this Windows application that we are developing. It is connecting from the server to a device via TCP. This connection has to remain open so I send a TCP alive packet every 5 minutes from the server. In Wireshark this looks good, every single TCP Alive package is acknowledged. But every 40 minutes (sharp) the server is still sending a FIN ACK (without any previous FIN from the device).
 The server and devices are on diffrent subnets and I only made Wireshark monitor the traffic between the server and device (because there would be A LOT of data regarding other applications).
 I'm stuck on this. Why is the connection dropped every 40 minutes? Any pointers in the right direction?

 We're leasing a new facility. Fiber is EVERYWHERE. They even ran fiber to workstations. Problem is, the sheathing on the fiber doesn't specify if it is multimode or single. Nor is there any other identfying part number. Just the manufacture (Berk-Tek) and 62.5/125. I'm guessing this fiber was run in the arly 90's. Some fiber bundles are orange and some are blue (but not aqua). I'm guessing all the fiber was run in the early to mid 90's.
 ​
 So not being a fiber expert, is all 62.5/125 multimode fiber?

 No loyalty whatsoever. I'll go where the money and good working environments are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to better understand how SD-WAN Provides Remote access from sites, and when it becomes a SASE solution. 
 I have had clients ask about Implementing SD-WAN for remote access, and usually weasel my way out of the question, and implement things my way - as I do not understand how SD-WAN is a remote access solution on it's own, or how my clients are expecting it to pan out. 
 When reading and learning about SD-WAN, it really feels/reads like simple WAN failover. In order to use it for remote sites, NGFW providers are going to have you set up an IPSEC Site-to-Site VPN on both WAN connections, or they will have you link both connections to a SASE broker for central cloud access to all needed sites. 
 I guess what I am seeking is affirmation that my Idea of SD-WAN for remote site access is correct, or clarification of what SD-WAN is really doing for remote site access. 
 For some context: I am a server admin who has self taught networking through my years at an MSP, and has implemented some fairly robust networks, but do to lack of formal education, I do not always understand what I am implementing until after I have implemented it. Is this reckless? Probably. Has it worked out really well for all parties involved? Yes!
 Thank you for any clarifications!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some tips or even some documentation on improving my 2022 RDS setup. Converting over from 2012r2 and so far it's been a huge let down in performance. Hypervisor wise I'm running dual Xeon Gold 6354s and Enterprise SSDs and NVMe drives. I'm using GPU-P for vGPU and currently are supporting 2 VMs with a RTX A2000 12GB. For profiles I'm utilizing FSLogix Profiles which are stored on one of the Hypervisor NVMe drives.
 My primary issue comes from RDS performance - my primary RDSH is currently configured with 20 VPs set to 100% reserve and 72GB Ram - this supports around 11 users. And it is slowwwwwww. Users are complaining about performance and when I log in I see it - it's ridiculous. 
 However, I check the monitoring software (I use Veeam One and ProcMon) on the hypervisor and the server is SLEEPING! I've spent weeks scouring the internet for clues and I've tried several things but all of them have returned very little progress. 
 Would love some input or guidance on what I'm doing wrong - I suppose the Virtual Switch is a problem (just tried swapping to SR-IOV today) but still not getting the results I should expect.

Minimum Fibre Cores in the fibre cable between any two buildings: Each switch connects back to the core of the network with 4 fibre cores (2 running clockwise, 2 running anti-clockwise).

 My boss wants to to get SD-WAN for our company just because a few hiccup from our ATT ISP last year. I told him that our current environment we don't need it because most of our applications are SaaS and we have technically two sites via S2S VPN (AWS, and ERP). Yes, we have vocal when shyt happen but that only once or twice a year thing and spending $18k is not a solution. I rather increase my salary by $18k to hear complains and bringing back the business within a day which happens all the time. So to all networkers out there, is it worth to spend $18k for SDWAN if you have 1 HQ + AWS and ERP (different vendor) ? if not, why?

Occasionally, an obvious phishing/malicious email will somehow make it through defender 365 filters and our plethora of mail flow rules. When this happens, my well trained users report the message, and I further analyze the email to confirm that it is obviously malicious. Once I've confirmed the details, I'll then submit to Microsoft for analysis, but Microsoft has been coming back lately with a verdict of "should not have been blocked". Ummm, wtf. Sometimes they get it right, but it seems like the success rate is about 50%.
 (Hey dumbasses, I submitted the email to you because it is obviously malicious, yet you fail to properly analyze)
 Does anyone else get any value from submitting messages to Microsoft for analysis? I'm thinking I just won't bother any more, because obviously it isn't going to help if Microsoft is struggling to correctly identify the most obvious phishing emails. Anyone else having this experience with your email submissions? Is MSTIC staffed by monkeys?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. So we have a set of laptops that are used by many people for a specific task. It's a fleet of about 15 now, but it could grow. These laptops are running a mix of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS. I'm trying to find some software that'll let us track the laptops and factory wipe them if they get lost, stolen, etc. Is there a good program for this? I saw Prey Project gets close, but it doesn't seem like they can factory reset Ubuntu machines. What do you all use? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently installed a fairly decent APC UPS here at my building, along with the NMC card, which I have set up to send me email notices if there are problems. This is working well. 
 Shortly after configuring all of this I started getting fairly regular emails regarding the UPS switching to battery due to both erratic power, and low voltage. I've been investigating possible reasons for this including contacting the power company. A couple weeks ago I found out that a tenant in our building (warehouse units) has a welder that they use occasionally. I went down and talked to them, explained what I was seeing and they agreed to let me know the next time they were going to use the welder!
 Today, they called me and let me know they would be using it in the next few minutes, and indeed the notices started rolling in! So this really does seem to be the cause of the issues that I'm seeing.
 My perception is that if this is happening regularly, then something needs to be adjusted and fixed otherwise I can expect less life out of my UPS. That said, I'm not an electrician and I have no idea what could possibly be changed or adjusted to try to fix this. I know at least that the panel my UPS is on is separate from the panel the welder is hooked up to. But I would guess that they are both hooked to the same service connections back in a common point in our building. I feel like the guys with the welder are willing to help figure this out, I'm not worried about who pays for what at this stage or getting them to pay it. What I am trying to find out is what could be done on a technical level.
 Does anyone have any thoughts? Thanks in advance.

It seems redundant; both tables have the same key info used by DAI. If by enabling DAI, a MAC-to-IP mapping needs to be checked for ARP traffic anyway, it's not like anyone would be able to poison the ARP table anyway.

When we were first acquired I was told one of the perks we'd be losing was our annual bonus the original owners used to give us (Edit for clarification on this part since I realized it was confusing in the larger context: I was moved to the corporate IT team beginning of 2020 with a different management chain and officially became part of corporate). Fast forward a few years and the new company sends out an email to several people regarding their bonus policy and I thought "that's funny, because I've never gotten a bonus since we were acquired".

 Long story short, the MSP that was servicing a remote office that we acquired didn't renew a service contract that included a server backup. I'm in the process getting local storage shipped to that office so we can do backups to local storage and then out to the cloud but I need something more immediate. I'm currently backing up to a remote share in another office over the WAN but that's extremely slow so I wanted to see if backup directly to Wasabi was possible.

 We were thinking a wall mount, but honestly from what I'm seeing, it will have to be somewhat high, above an unrelated lab device, which I think will end up being problematic down the road.
 I think what may be the most ideal setup would be a monitor/keyboard arm that can mount to the side of the table/desk, but still allow the monitor/keyboard/mouse to be adjusted straight out in front of the lab machines.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on something that would work well? It's just a single monitor, so dual-monitor setup not necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So uhhhm as the title states we have seen a rather alarming increase of peoples accounts being compromised despite MFA being on and setup. But the crazy part is the end users are reporting ZERO MFA requests on their end. They get them when they actually request them. I work for an MSP and its a number wide number of clients of ours that are being affected. Luckily its not more than like one or two per client for the clients affected. 
 I know end users aren't getting notifications as I got a user to help me out. He has a One Plus phone and they have a nifty notifications history feature. He let me comb through his notifications (Luckily it was a device he purchased exclusively for work so there wasn't any personal stuff) and sure enough not a single notification of an MFA request outside of ones he requested which I verified through the sign in logs in Azure. When you look at the logs I see CRAZY sign ins. Like one from Germany and the log says: 
 Authentication requirement: Multifactor authentication
 Status: Success 
 I'm really confused on how this is possible tbh. Initially my first instinct was a SIM hijack but that wouldn't affect the authenticator. Just to cross it out we've been having affected users call their carriers and nothing out of the ordinary. Then session hijacking comes to mind but the fact its such a broad spectrum of people affected in both locations and companies in general, it was hard to imagine that to be it. And I know that its not just my org. Ive seen a couple of unanswered forums on Microsoft forums and places like spice works. Its just becoming increasingly more common every day and its kinda alarming as thats the WHOLE point of MFA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone notice that Windows will prompt you to restart for updates before it is done installing all available updates? It appears the prompt occurs the moment the first update is ready for a restart, even as other updates show up as "pending install". In our company, this sometimes leads to users being prompted to restart multiple times. Is it possible to delay that restart prompt until all available updates are ready for a restart? or just mutel/delay it altogether?

I can continue to console in and make changes without having to pay a yearly fee. HP only sells Aruba now, Juniper is pushing Mist so hard that it feels like a requirement, and Meraki has always been based on licensing. Are there any other enterprise brands besides Cisco that allow me to run my switches with full control, as long as I want, without a subscription?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 My company are hiring a VPS to a famous cloud company, and i'm about to give sources access of a website to a webmaster via FTP sources. But, the thing is that he isn't really experienced in web codes, so, I worked on a way to backup the web sources everyday and manage them.
 Thus, yesterday I compressed a 29Go folder in a 14Go folder in 1h20. I used bz2 to compress the folder and a 14Go archive looks decent to me to keep it for 1 day. But, the process has taken 1h20. This bother me because its a web server (even if it was a 4AM) so the sites performances are getting slowed during this time. The command I used to backup everything is this one :
 tar -cvjSf archive.tar.bz2 web_folder
 Does anyone know if I even can maybe make the process a bit faster? Any suggestions are appreciated :)
 Note, from the graphs I checked, the processus doeens't look this overloaded (60% during the backup) but the RAM looked saturated. The RAM / Disk I/O are the slowing point I think.

 I mean in my mind, this danger exists with practically everything, even if I buy a Logitech branded camera, it's still made in China with Chinese chips.
 I'd hope our endpoint security and/or intrusion detection provider would see unusual traffic, but what other steps can I take?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is trying to implement SSO through IAM Identity Center in our multi-account AWS Organization. For context, we used the AWS Landing Zone accelerator to set up our environment and added several workload accounts to their own OU. Our company also uses Azure AD, and I can edit groups. 
 For each workload account (there are currently 10 and will be more), we want to have both dev and admin roles per account for users to live in. With this in mind, I thought of 2 options for AD/SSO integration:
 OPTION 1: Creating a user group for every role and account, meaning that there would be a dev and admin user group for every workload account. The drawback to this approach is the higher number of user groups to manage, but we could utilize AWS managed policies. 
 OPTION 2: Using AD attributes (ABAC) to create custom permission sets that define a user as dev/admin, so that there only needs to be 1 user group per workload account, and dev/admin roles are determined through ABAC. The drawback to this approach is the initial set up of custom policies, but it results in less AD user groups to manage. 
 Which option would you go with, or are there other/better alternatives?

 The last few days or so I've been diving into creating rules/policies at work on one of our Palo's. In the gui I create the rule, place it in the correct order and commit. Apparently it doesn't actually take this order though? It's been explained to me that I have to cli into it afterwards, and run a few "debug device-server" commands and force commit for it to actually sort the rules properly. Surely this isn't by design? If it is, would there be a specific reason?
 Thanks in advance for any input.

 Just wondering, what are other folks in the industry using as their NMS system for large-scale networks with 7,000+ nodes ? We are a WISP and have started our journey into network automation. During Phase 1, we would like to clean up our inventory before building the source of truth, as it has gotten out of control. Our current IPAM and several NMS systems are not in sync, and we don't know how many nodes are actually out in the field. The only information we have is the subnets the nodes could be on.
 The NMS system must have substantial discovery/scanning capabilities and be extensible, as we would like to integrate it with other systems (Nautobot or Netbox). It must also have a really good API. A huge plus if it is free/open source. Any thoughts?
 Thanks!

 This is fairly straight forward corporate office setup: single firewall uplink (no multi-homing (yet?)), a few racks for on-site server gear, access layer on multiple floors for network drops (PoE), and Wifi APs. The building is still under construction and we get access in a few months (Sept? Oct?). Management wants to get in ASAP as we're currently month-to-month on the current office.
 I'm sure the resellers/vendors will promise that they can deliver in X weeks/months, but I just want to know to know what various vendors (Cisco, Aruba/HPE, Juniper, PA, Fortinet, etc) will probably come back with, and how realistic those statements will be. We're in Canada if that makes a difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I need advice on how to best organize a homelab. I would like to manage a media server, create an efficient solution for backing up my data and computers, and leave some room for future experimentation.
 At the moment, I have purchased a Synology DS220+ because I was attracted to its ease of configuration and the pre-installed DSM packages. While I noticed several valuable packages like Hyperbackup, Active Backup for Business, and others, I have encountered some issues:
  
The Synology server is not very powerful.
 Some packages are not frequently updated, so I resorted to using Docker.
 Configuring some Docker containers seems to be particularly difficult on DSM.
  
Therefore, I am considering setting up a second server where I can install an OS like Unraid or TrueNAS to manage the media server and act as a redundancy for the Synology server. This way, I could use the Synology as a reliable and secure solution while having fun with other containers on the second server. Do you think this choice makes sense? Additionally, I'm thinking of buying an HSGT HC550 18TB HDD for the Synology since I found a great price (€250). On one hand, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity, but on the other hand, I don't want to waste money if I don't have that much data to store.
 I also have two spare 6TB SAS HDDs and a friend's R720 server that I could purchase at a low, symbolic cost. However, I'm concerned about its power consumption and how to accommodate such a bulky server.

 Users are complaining that this time is too short, so I tried to raise it to 5 or 10 minutes... without any luck: workstations are still locked after 3 minutes and I can't explain why.
 Currently I also unlinked GPO from my domain, rebooted workstations, run gpupdate /force multiple times... without success.
 For example, I just rebootted a workstation and gpresult /r tell me that GPO lock screen is NOT there.
 I guess there is something that I am missing in controlling what GPO are applied, and this is the most important thing I'd like to understand, not the specific case :)
 Any help in troubleshooting this? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This customer uses RDP (over Citrix) to connect to a financial service at an external party. They don't logon using the DOMAIN\User format but the modern user@domain format. The username is abstract (think U2123651213132@acme.com) so they want the username to be saved by the RDP client.
  
 However, at logon time, it drops the last few chars of the username and fails logon. It tries to logon with U2123651213132@acm in one user, and U2123651213133@acme.c in another user. If they correct in manually, it works, but I don't understand why it "forgets" a part of the user name. I've never seen that before. Maybe it has to do with Citrix, but to me it looks like Citrix just opens a VPN and then opens an RDP session.
  
 For Germans: this behaviour is when using Datev Smart-IT.

 I believe using a vacuum cleaner with hepa filters is the best way to dust your hardware.

 We had a major reorganization fairly recently that has taken about 20 or so smaller groups and one large and mashed into one massive group. Sadly, this was done with no plan or afterthough.
 Three years later what we have is basically yugoslavia in the 90's. We lack many basic supportstructures and the infighting between teams, groups and departments makes me sad and depressed tbh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've run into a bit of an odd issue and would appreciate some input.
 I've got one of my clusters reporting the following error:
  
The computer object associated with the cluster network name resource "SQL Network Name (---)" could not be updated in domain "---" during the Password change operation. 
 The text for the associated error code is: The specified network password is not correct. 
 The cluster identity "CNO$" may lack permissions required to update the object. Please work with your domain administrator to ensure that the cluster identity can update computer objects in the domain.
  
Now, I've only seen this error posted with the "Access is denied" code, which usually is resolved by, well, fixing the access permissions that the CNO has on the other resources in order to update them. However, I fail to find anything mentioning my exact error with the incorrect password of the CNO account and a suggested solution for it.
 I've had a look at this with an external party suggesting we still work on the permissions the CNO object has in AD, giving it full control. But I like to avoid just tossing permissions at things hoping it works, especially because this error does not suggest a permission issue.
 I have found the following article, although without my error mentioned, but it makes the most sense (atleast for me) for the issue I'm facing: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/failover-clustering/understanding-the-repair-active-directory-object-recovery-action/ba-p/371891
 This suggests taking the Cluster Name resource offline and using the Repair feature, as this will apparently use the credentials of the currently logged on user to reset the CNO password and replace it.
 I'd like to have a second set of eyes on this, maybe someone has even had this issue before already. I'm not too well versed with Failover Clusters, but the suggestion of the external party doesn't seem proper to me.

 But since the 1st of June, these certificates are delivered to me on an eToken from our vendor. Therefore, I don't have access to the private key file anymore.

 First time posting here, I work in a Steel Warehouse with 5-6 computers. My manager wanted “more Ethernet ports” so he plugged in a HP ProCurve 2524 switch into the RJ45 wall port and then plugged it into multiple computers and phones with no result. He then unplugged it and tried to return everything to how it was and the EJ45 port seems to be dead. 
 I’ve now been tasked with fixing this as I’m the only person who has turned the router on and off before to fix the internet /s , but I’m completely lost with the intricacies of this. 
 Any help to get the wall ports working would be amazing :) 
 Thanks, Jacob

We’re going to have the tp-link vpn router do the routing. To do this do we need to disable the DHCP IP routing on the Comcast modem or does it not matter? We just plug the modem directly into the the network input on the vpn router and have it do DHCP from there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this particular instance, I'm looking to set up Universal Print to make finding and adding printers more self-service friendly for users as we move machines to be Azure AD joined only. Our print server is running on a 2019 Server Core VM. I can install the Universal Print connector service just fine, but I can't register it with Azure because it wants to open a browser to handle the sign in process.
 On the other hand, the connector service for Azure AD's SSO agent handles this registration process via Powershell. I can't remember which, but I believe I've also encountered one that prompts you to open a MS login page on your workstation and gives you a code to enter. 
 I feel like of all the services to run on Server Core, a Print Server is high up there. It seems like laziness that the only reason the Universal Print connector doesn't support Server Core is because it doesn't have a browser to handle logging into Azure to complete the registration process. There's even a Powershell module for managing the connector (such as adding printers to it) after it's been registered! The UP team needs to talk to whichever team worked on the connectors for those other services and copy their registration process.
 Another one that seems lazy to me for similar reasons is the PowerBI data gateway. Once it's registered, I've never seen the need to interact with it again. It SHOULD be able to be run on Server Core but once again, it doesn't because rather than create a registration process via PowerShell they went the lazy way and required a browser based login.

 Today I got an email response saying that since I opened the switch case to blow out dust, my warranty claim is being denied and I should have called them before opening the case.
 I believe that this type of claim denial is illegal. So tomorrow I get to research the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act and find the ftc ruling that was made in 2015.
 Not sure if I should post the name of the company. I'll just say that several years ago they had LIFETIME warranty on their switches. 
 Who else blows dust out of gear as routine maintenance? Or how about doing it as when touched as non-routine maintenance?

 The new Director is finally hitting their stride and is now beginning to map out the plan they have in mind.
 Part of this plan is to validate the need for VPNs due to them being a potential threat vector, but on the flip side wants to also revert back to RDS gateways because…..well I have no idea.
 The discussion of deep packet investigation came up as well.
 The director wants to be able to scan network traffic with DPI through the VPN tunnel to investigate if malware is present or not. From all the stuff I’ve known and read I don’t think DPI can read the data or packets in transit through the VPN tunnel but just see that there is data being sent/received?
 there are quite a few more things to get into but parenthood calls, but am I wrong to be challenging these decisions or discussions?

 We are a small company looking to replace our aging wireless N APs and have been suggested Aruba APs. Our current access points (15 total) use external antennas and are fixed in some tricky places where removal is not going to be easy. If we get Aruba 534 or similar APs would these antennas work without issue? We likely won’t be utilising wifi 6 immediately and likely using 2.4ghz for a while longer due to the environment, but we have dying hardware that needs upgrading.
 Also what’s the cheapest method to manage these? Seems the cloud manager is a paid product, can a virtual controller be setup on Aruba?

 We have 3 servers with 2 sockets each (but each socket only has 6 cores which is kind of lame but oh well.)
 That’s 48 core licenses we may need.
 We have 10 core licenses already.
 It appears we need to buy 38 more cores.
 2 core license packs can be bought for 93.00 each on tech soup
 (19) 2 core packs may be needed to give us 48 core licenses to cover all (3) 16 core machines and will cost $1,767
 Cost is way better than data center still
 Oh and each licensed hyper v windows server standard can run 2 VM’s so we have a total of 6 VM’s possible.
 If we want to buy another 93 dollar license and make sure that VM is only allotted 2 cores we can have more.

 I started a Network Admin position recently, there is one other member on that team that was already there. The company I am working for is a rather large industrious company. They run 24/7 and hate stopping for maintenance, patching, etc. Because of this many of the IDFs and the MDF (for at least a couple of the locations) are a mess. Spaghetti everywhere, no labels, etc. the only reason it runs is tribal knowledge, nothing written or documented in any sense. I am tasked with documenting everything, organizing it, re doing any problem cabinets, and most important of all HAVING LITTLE TO NO DOWN TIME. I realize that there will be some necessary and will break that ice to the company. I just am curious if anyone has any advice for getting cables properly lengthen and swapped to new devices, centrally organizing everything, and just general cleanup? TIA
 Tl;dr: I started a network job, company hates downtime, all the cabinets are a mess and unlabeled, and my job is to clean it up

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My security team asked me to look for a way to prevent users from interacting with the various AI style chatbots you see on webpages. Not chatgpt per se, but even the pop up chat bots that answer basic questions and have been around for years.
 My firewall vendor does not have any application controls, botnet detection, DLP etc that could target this web traffic, and official response from them is that it is not on the radar.
 -I might be able to discover some associated IPs and block them, but very manual and not robust.
 -May be able to find a user-agent string in http request to block. Maybe more success here but the same draw backs really.
 ​
 If you can think of any feasible approach I would love to hear it. Thanks!

One mail flagged for the "naughty scam/spam" category seemed unusual, since it came from the domain of another company in this city. Looked inside and saw a conversion + attachments that make it very clear that an affair between A and B is going on. 
 Main problem: The soon-to-be wife of A is a friend of mine, so I'am somewhat personally entangled in this. I dont know what or even if I should do something. Would feel awful to not tell my friend whats going on, but I feel like my hands are tied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve run into a curious issue where it seems a Cisco stack’s PVST (could be PVST+, will confirm) BPDUs are finding their way through an RSTP topology made up of Dell S4048 switches connected via 802.1Q trunks and hitting the upstream provider’s Ethernet access port. 
 The upstream provider’s switch turns their port to blocking mode due to receiving a PVST(+) BPDU on a non-802.1Q trunk, or so I’m told by the ISP. When we disconnect the Cisco stack from the topology, the upstream ISP’s MAC addresses appear on the network a few seconds later.
 Links go:
 Cisco stack (dot1q Po6) -> Dell S4048 pair in VLT (dot1q Po27) -> Dell S4048 pair in VLT (separate domain) (vlan 998 access) -> upstream provider switches.
 The Dell switches use RSTP, PVST+ is not enabled on them.
 Is it possible for the PVST+ BPDUs from the Cisco to be passing through the dot1q links (Cisco to Dell to Dell) and then finding their way to the upstream ISP’s switchports which triggers their BPDU protections? I’ve read an article (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/24063-pvid-inconsistency-24063.html) which talks about PVID inconsistency.
 The ISP side has two L2 lines and spanning tree is used to control which line is used.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why can't companies just do what they're supposed to, and not be giant piles of shit?
 About a month ago I noticed an IP address that kept trying to establish a VPN to our office, over and over. Every 5 seconds.
 We don't us IPSec for anything, so there's no way it's legit.
 So I look up the IP address, and it's owned by Comcast.
 Fire off an email to their abuse email address, along with the logs.
 A month later, nothing.
 So I call their abuse number. Now, you'd think that with an automatized menu item labeled "For malicious traffic originating from a comcast IP address, press 2" they'd have some clue of what they're doing.
 Not so much.
 After an hour on the phone, they give me a case number, and said that they'd escalate it, and I'd hear back from someone in a few days.
 8 days later, Nothing....
 So I call them again. Get hung up on.
 Call again, and get transferred to some poor tech in the xfinity department, who has no clue what's going on... But he's at least trying to help.
 I feel sorry for their actual customers.
 ​
 EDIT: Turns out we do use a single IPSec tunnel. So I was wrong there.

All have shared with me that ever since the cert issue a month back on the Vedges which caused client sites to go dark forcing them to upgrade all of their Vedges they have seen a big jump in potential clients reaching out to do a proof of concept for immediate replacement. My thought is this is possibly driven by upper management (business side), we as engineers sometimes underestimate the financial impact to a business in an event of an issue such as this. If your a VEdge customer what has been your managements direction after this issue if you were impacted?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All, I was wondering if anyone could give me tips on adding redundancy to our current network. We currently have an Active/Passive Fortigate cluster in place, however, below the Active/Passive cluster is our core switch which is a single point of failure. My goal is to make the core redundant, I was thinking of purchasing two Aruba 3810M's and stacking them via backplane, however, I have also thought of just not stacking them. Please see my concerns below and feel free to share your opinions.
 Network Diagram - https://imgur.com/tR00ax3
 ​
  
I understand that stacking at the core isn't the greatest idea, because of the shared control plane, however, we aren't a 24/7 facility, however, I do like the sounds of being able to update the core switch and not having to worry about the network going down.
 Reguardless if I stack or don't stack the L3 switches, will I need LACP to go from the Firewall to my L3 core switches?
 What's the added complexity with not stacking the switches? I believe that stacking the core switches and making one logical switch reduces config complexity, right?
  
​
 What do you guys think, should I stack at the core or keep the L3 switches separate? What protocols/technology would you put in place to achieve this? 
 ​
 Thanks for reading my post, I am looking forward to everyone's feedback from the community!

 I have solarwinds network toolset installed (just installed today) on a windows server and our requirement is to monitor bandwidth on our edge routers and send email alerts when it goes beyond a certain threshold, can this tool do the job? I see a bandwidth gauges but don't know if this tool can then send alerts via email, will have to play around a bit. I am used to the solarwinds NPM tool and I know that you can do bandwidth monitoring and stuff like that on this tool so if solarwinds toolset turns out not to be the tool we want then will have to buy the solarwinds NPM.

 I asked her what email were they sending to and what email was the user checking? 
 We have two email accounts for all employees on for our company which is a contractor and the other is a county government email account that all employees receive once hired. 
 Turns out both the manager, and the clerk, and the receptionist were all sending from their county accounts to the company email. Our company has better security than the county so sometimes it is blocked. 
 I told the users to try sending from county email to county email, they all said it didn't work because that user was never set up in county. I call county IT and they said she was set up. So I log in to test and all is good, but no one told me.... 
 I asked the users to test send to the county email as the user is set up, but they said it didn't work. I had to go to each of their computers to show them how to type in the county email, because outlook likes to auto-populate the most common emails used. After I left their desks they still said it wasn't working. 
 I reminded them that they have to type the email in a couple more times before it auto-fills. I wonder how any work actually gets done here...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, long story short i'm studying POE power delivery so I can use it on custom designed networked electronic devices but I have a few doubts on what to expect from comercial PSEs and I figured this would probably be the best place to ask.
 My main doubts are understanding the default settings and user-changeable options when dealing with off-the-shelf PSEs.
 Since I don't need 1gb I'm just focusing on 100base.
 As Alternative A and Alternative B aren't part of the POE negotiation PSE's can just be compatible with one of them but devices are probably recommended to be compatible with both? Or is it easy to find/set what wiring scheme the PSE is set to?
 And regarding Passive POE, disregarding injectors, are they all set to on by default? It seems possible to turn off/on by the user in some models/brands?
 Thank you.
 Edit: Oh, one more thing. Haven't really dealt with POE devices yet but from my understanding of the thing, the POE controller needs power for the POE negotiation before power is made available through the ethernet connection right? Do you guys happen to know where the chip usually gets it's power from when a purely POE powered device is first hooked up? Small internal rechargeable battery or something of the sort?

 Essentially it removes the user from the local admin group and when requested by the user and approved it elevates the user. 
 Here lies the issue, we are trying to enroll the users in MDM (add work account in Microsoft settings / login to company portal) but it says the user needs elevation…
 Has anyone experienced this or know a workaround other than uninstalling the software which can have bad consequences or temporarily giving them a higher level admin access under supervision whilst setting this up? Both options are less than ideal but seeming not possible otherwise.
 Thanks any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Hyper V server with a VM that will not boot due to maxed out hard drive space. Management would not approve additional resource spend for this because it is going away in 6 months. Anyways, there was 3-5GB left and I was going to do work on it this weekend to expand but Windows Updates wanted to ruin my day. It kept asking to update yesterday, which never happens. Was there some forced Windows 2019 sever update? It appears to have eaten up the rest of the disk space. 
 The VM is in a saved state, I’m nervous to delete that saved state without Hyper V experts telling me to do so. I see various recommendations by searching but nothing definitive. 
  
Delete the saved state, reduce the memory size (currently 29 GB) and boot up. Delete unnecessary files and expand disk size. Restore memory back to normal or…
 Delete saved state. Copy the VHD to an external HD, boot the machine to that. Delete unnecessary files and move back… expand for a permanent fix. I see two large files, what do I copy? The avhdx file or that and the hard disk image file? 
  
Please recommend what is best. I do have IT consultants helping but he is passing it to someone else who is more experienced with Hyper V. I’m worried that may take hours so I may need to work on this myself. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I got a report early this week that one of our directors is having their inbox destroyed by solicitation emails. I believe they were accessing sites for recruitment and used their main work email. 
 I have some samples of the emails, and I can’t seem to find anything malicious about them. They’re legitimate, just extremely tenacious and annoying. I tried to look for a trend in them, so we could set up some rules to just delete them, but they don’t seem to follow anything scalable and they’re addresses are always different. 
 I looked in the exchange online portal, and the anti spam rules all seem like they’re for strictly malicious spam. I might be wrong, but I felt they wouldn’t be helpful. 
 I suggested that they just used the OWA to setup their own block/allow lists, but they can’t be bothered and wanted IT to do something about it. I’m kind of at a loss here. Is there anyway to get them out of this hole that I’m missing? Blocking the sending domains could be an option, but not all of them are things we would want to block. Like Glassdoor or legitimate recruitment sites that they and others might use. The worst is when the solicitors send meeting invites, they’re getting placed as tentative on the calendar. I got them out of that one with outlook calendar filters, but am clueless on the emails at this point. 
 Any guidance will be appreciated.

 Hoping you can provide some insight or what things i can look for 
 Looks like one of our users was attacked and sent out a bunch of spam emails, cleaned everything up but looks like there was two authenticator app registrations that are from mobile a OS that the user doesnt use. Have since removed these
 The user had SMS authentication enabled 
 Have implemented geo blocking and will ensure legacy auth is disabled but my query is how would the attacker been able to register the authenticator app and pass the MFA check. Thought about sim swapping but the users phone is still working fine. Possible phised or MITM MFA? 
 The entry in azure ad states 'User registered Authenticator App with Notification and Code' and from what i can tell was triggered from a browser client app

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR; Simulating a L2 Leaf Spine NW in GNS3 in preparation for a network re-architecture at work. The two spine switches seem to both forward any routed traffic. Can't figure out why, and was curious if anyone here encountered this before or know if its possibly a problem with GNS3 and wouldn't happen on real devices?
 More detail:
 Small network I am currently simulating in GNS3 to learn more about how to implement L2LS consists of 2 spine switches (VLT Pair), 1 standalone leaf switch, and 2 leaf switches that are a VLT pair. OOBM switch in place for VLT backuo links
 I have 2 VLANS i am using to test routing. On each leaf switch I have two docker containers connected to it on each vlan. I am not yet testing any kind of VLT port channel from leaf switches to "server" just single connections for now.
 LEAF1-P1 -> SPINE1-P1 LEAF1-P2 -> SPINE2-P1
 LEAF2-P1 -> SPINE1-P2 LEAF2-P2 -> SPINE2-P2 LEAF3-P1 -> SPINE1-P3 LEAF3-P2 -> SPINE2-P3
 SPINEX-P1 are in VLT-PC1 SPINEX-P2/3 are in VLT-PC2 LEAF2/3-P1/2 are in VLT-PC2
 VRRP setup on SPINEs with virtip 192.168.X.1
 On Leaf1 I have a docker container with IP 192.168.2.50 trying to ping the docker container on LEAF2 with IP 192.168.4.51
 When that happens I get 3 duplicate responses.
 Basically what is happening is that SPINE1 (the main VLT/VRRP) gets the packet to be forwarded from VLAN 2 to VLAN4, and routes it appropriately. SPINE1 then sends that packet over VLTi to SPINE2, and then SPINE2 ALSO routes and forwards that packet. So the 192.168.4.51 gets 2x ping request. THEN, the same kind of doubling occurs on the response back ending uo with 4 responses sent to 192.168.2.50.
 Has Anyone seen this before? Is this expected behavior and I am messing up by trying to do L3 routing in a L2LS Network? Im basically the only networking person on my program, so sadly I do not have any way to bounce ideas off a true netwrok engineer other than going to the internet

 I am currently a senior systems engineer and we have found out our company will be closing down over the next 6 months to a year.
 I have been in IT for nearly 20 years, with 12 years as a system admin.
 With some time to go before we finish up, I thought I would look at how to expand my skills and if there are any other areas I should look into. 
 My main focuses have been Virtualisation and Storage, with a bit of Azure work over the last few roles. 
 I have worked quite closely with security teams, and find some of that quite interesting, but have heard it can end up being mostly spreadsheets and less finding/fixing issues.
 Any Tips? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone else seen this behaviour?
 It happened a few weeks ago, then stopped, but seems to be back now.
 Happens in Edge or Chrome, and neither the browser versions nor the Outlook version has changed over that time, so I'm assuming it's a change to the backend sharepoint code, although getting ms to admit that seems to be worse than pulling wisdom teeth...
 Usually, when you drag an email from Outlook to a location in sharepoint, it copies the mail, but seems to be performing a move instead.
 The mail does go to deleted items, but sometimes fails to copy correctly and leaves a corrupt file in sharepoint.
 Ctrl-drag does copy okay without deleting.

 However, I'm not sure this is a scalable solution. I've talked with the head of my department and we want to look at a proper ticketing system. We've moven to Microsoft recently from Google Workspace and I want to know if there are solution out there that integrate particularly we'll with this environment and apps like Teams. Prefer it to be a cloud-based application, would be a plus if they have a mobile app. Functionality we want ticketing and ITSM. 
 Does anyone have experience with this, and can recommend a package you're satisfied with? I've looked around on the internet for the past couple of day's and well, there's a lot out there... And almost all look the same?
 Thanks for your replies in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for input from anyone else that has dealt with this.
 A higher up at our company fell victim to an email hijack scam. Reviewing the messages, it is pretty clear one of the vendors involved in the email process had been compromised. 
 The email thread looks normal. The vendor requested and sent an invoice for payment on equipment.
 Two days later there was another follow up urging the payment quickly. The vendor also requested a change in ACH information. You can clearly see the email domain changed at this point and the language has the feel of poor translation. To me there were red flags at this point and had I been involved I would have urged a phone call to confirm the validity of the message.
 Another recipient on the thread from another company involved in this large purchase even doubled down on the payment request. Technically he was fooled too.
 So technically our systems were never compromised. But we are the victim since we made the false payment.
 Whose insurance gets involved here? I assume next step is to report this to the authorities. (local FBI cyber field office)
 Our company has traditionally not taken any of this seriously. I have managed to secure much of the infra a bit at a time with MFA, good AV and better policies. But my scope of oversight has never been able to influence finance and other at risk departments. Policies on ACH payments and convincing key departments to adopt things like password managers has been an uphill battle.
 Anyway, would not mind hearing how others navigated this.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, i have a question about Exchange 365 behaviour and hope that it's ok to post it here directly.
 We have to migrate distribution groups from one domain to another.
 The way we do this is to rename the old group via EAC and create the new group in EAC with the new domain OU.
 We rebuild the whole group settings, add the members and secondary mail adresses.
 But now we have a big discussion about the X500 adresses in the secondary mail adresslist if we really need them or not. 
 Some years ago our exchange migrated to a newer version and therefore added the X500 adresses, the groups stayed the same.
 But with the completely new group and new SID, do we really need the X500?
 Does the new group will miss some data when we doesnt add the X500?
 Or do i have to update the X500 string to the new adress or sid for working with the new group? 
 Thanks for your time

 We've just installed 2 Firebox T80 in HA and since 3 Internet connections arrives in VLANs and only 1 with physical cables (the router is right there), it would be easier for me to use VLANs inside the firewall too instead of transform them in physical cables in the switches (double because the firewalls are 2).
 It's been suggested to me that it's better for the Internet lines to be connected as physical ports instead of VLAN, but is that true? What are the cons in using VLANs (beside the limit of 1Gbps that I wish I could saturate with the Internet lines!)?
 Thanks!

 I've just unboxed some new N9K-C93180YC-FX3 V01 and N9K-C93108TC-FX3P V03. The plan is to use the 180 as parent switches and the 108 as fex (software fex mode). The thing is, i just can't get these things to run and can't find anything related to my problem with cisco documentations etc.
 The switches are running a newer software release than required per fex compatibility matrix.
 The 108 are configured in software FEX mode as per cisco documentation.
 switch(config)# write erase
 switch(config)# no boot nxos
 switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config
 switch(config)# boot fex
 switch(config)# reload
 ​
 The 180 parent switch is configured as follows:
 switch(config)# install feature-set fex
 switch(config)# feature-set fex
 switch(config)# interface port-channel 113
 switch(config-if)# switchport
 switch(config-if)# switchport mode fex-fabric
 switch(config-if)# fex associate 113
 switch(config-if)# no shut
 -----------------------------------------------------
 switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/49,ethernet 1/50
 switch(config-if)# switchport
 switch(config-if)# switchport mode fex-fabric
 switch(config-if)# fex associate 113
 switch(config-if)# channel-group 113
 switch(config-if)# no shutdown
 switch(config-if)# exit
 The fex is just not coming up, the interfaces stay on not connected states (Connected via port eth1/49 to 1/49, 1/50 to 1/50 using QSFP-100G-CU5M DAC Cable) . Has anyone any ideas what might be causing this?

 The other day I was trying to add a new ap and another client was obviously doing the same thing. They ended up adopting my AP and it started broadcasting their wifi network. 
 It got me thinking is this normal or is our msp missing something with their controller config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a grandstream VOIP system we swapped for a previously working nortel system. One segment is shared by another vendor/entity. They have cisco 2900 switches. Durring business hours, every 4 or so minutes all devices on the phone vlan (10) drop all traffic for about 10 seconds then come back. All the computers on the default network plugged into the PC side of the phones stay up and work fine. 
 Our down stream device is a UNIFI 24 POE with VLAN 10. Tested both as a trunk and an access port both have the same result. Every 4 minutes all vlan traffic drops. 
 ​
 Troubleshooting has been limited. We have no access to the cisco equipment so i'm looking for suggestions to have them look for or even us. 
 Tested so far. We added a UNIFI switch directly in their cabinet. (to eliminate the 168ft CAT 6 run). No ports ever drop on anyone's equipment.
 We have constant pings going to all phones and changed that to 4096 packet size to see if it was exhausting some sort of buffer. That didn't change the frequency of the drops at all. 
 That's pretty much it. The other guys have just swapped from trunked traffic to access port traffic. They have no idea what is really happening on their side.

 One Proxmox server 10.0.0.17:8006
 I built another Ubuntu server (not on Proxmox) and gave it the same IP. Oops, removed server (Off)
 Except now, Macbook with Firefox cannot reach 10.0.0.17:8006 even after reboot
 Mint laptop with Firefox - no problems, brings up management console. WHY???
 I'll look past the jokes about the Macbook Air (I know...)
 I've tried clear cache, private window, nothing seems to work. It's not OMG critical, but never seen this in all my years (Arp cache??) Looking for ideas. Thanks!
 Update EDIT: The answer was Arp cache!
 How on a MACbook Air? Interestingly, opening a TERMINAL and typing 
 >arp -a
 does not show that IP address in the list.
 However: >sudo arp -a -d
 cleared all entries, and now it works.
 If anyone else finds this problem, think of ARP similar to DNS:
 DNS will take a domain name (dell.com) and translate to an IP address.
 whereas ARP will take an IP address, and translate it to a MAC address on the local network.
 So: proxmox.domain.local = 10.0.0.17
 and 10.0.0.17 = e3:d4:ac:f4:39:0a
 And this ARP table on the MACBOOK had the incorrect MAC address.
 clearing the ARP cache with >sudo arp -a -d
 cleared that table and let the MAC re-ask where that IP address was.
 Thanks to everyone for troubleshooting!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi y'all! 
 I'm changing the networking components at a nonprofit I work for. Their current set-up includes 3 netgear nighthawk routers (one per building) and those are connected to unmanaged gigabit switches (also from netgear) and one main Dell switch from like 2008. 
 They have unmanaged switches everywhere since the main building was built back in the 50's. None of the cabling has labels and its basically a sh*tshow.
 Anyways, I'm trying to replace everything and basically start brand new. I'm looking for recommendations on routers and switches. Right now, we have a nighthawk RAX70 router in the main building and that connects two outerbuildings, one with a nighthawk AC1900 & the other with netgear r6120 acting as AP's. 
 What are the things I should take into consideration when looking for new routers and managed switches? I know I need gigabit ports. We have about 50 users spread out in these buildings that require reliable connection. I was looking into the Cisco router firewall plus gx50, but this does require a subscription. Also the Cisco 1000 series for the switches.

To me, it seems more than general aversion to new technologies, even though it overall seems better than using TCP in most applications. Is it just part of the big tech hate?
 As someone who works a lot with traffic optimization over the public internet, I have found using QUIC to be immensely more useful to me than dealing with pure UDP or *shudder* TCP.

 The switch is on .1 and the firewall/router is at .252 for both of the subnets. The firewall/router and AP are both FortiNet.
 Port 48 is my uplink, port 46 is my AP.
 AP is currently broadcasting the guest SSID on VLAN 124 and the corp SSID on VLAN 0 (to avoid double tagging).
 Data SSID works great, but I can't get DHCP on the Guest SSID and I'm just flabbergasted. The firewall never even sees the request.
 Does anyone have ANY clue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a lot of troubleshooting, I figured out our Catalyst 9500 is dropping DHCP helper packets, causing clients obviously to fail. This happens cross vlan, and even cross VRF - so on the whole router. We have isolated and can recreate and verify that the reason is a HDMI-to-IP AV device that is using broadcast. We can through inspection of the COPP control plane policy commands see that the router is dropping BROADCAST (Policier Queue 0) packets.
 I have to say I am a bit surprised to see the 9500 has default only 750pps rate limit for broadcast globally. How are people handling this and making sure bugged traffic, DoS or even just AVoIP devices doesn't stop DHCP relay from working "globally"?
 The traffic is not DHCP traffic, it's UDP 192.168.0.1->192.168.0.99, but the L2 destination is ffffff-ffffff. And port is not 67/68. I'm struggling to understand why the Cisco would even queue these packets for CPU handling?
 Anyway, I know I can rate limit the specific client and what not, but I want to know what is best practice for single users like this not killing a several 1000-user network.. Seems like a bad design on the Npu->cpu from Cisco's side?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: longtime sysadmin leaving job due to disrespect from old school manager who should've retired 2 years ago. anyone else doing the same? (multi-campus higher ed w/ 700+ employees, 20k students) (probably whiny sh!tpost coming) 
 the story: 
 I have spent my adult life building my career at my current job and am leaving after a multi year decline in the quality of decision making and employee relations failures of the head of the IT department. 
 The last 4-6 years have been marked by terrible decision making, "Do as i say not as i do" behavior, unchecked absenteeism (the dept head is known across the college for never being in the office, we don't allow work from home anymore) 
 one case study: He has assigned the sysadmin/netadmin team not only answer the helpdesk tech phone calls (one person per day every day) but the main number for the institution under the guise of being unable to staff the Service Desk (despite never even trying to hire and cutting hours of those we already employ) when we were told we were going to fill in we were given reasoning that the SC was getting blasted with calls and voicemails and we were a temporary stop gap. that was 6 months ago. there have never been reports produced with the actual metrics or progress made. no positions for the entry level job have ever been posted and now 6 months of this have gone by with little to no sign of it ending. HR is impotent as they've said they don't want this happening but it continues. the VP above has made promises to 'put a stop to it' yet it continues. 
 this is but one in a litany of examples of this toxic and abusive behavior, and an opportunity came up, so i took it. might recruit the rest of my team to come along... JB? KV? MG? (i know you will see this)

 Works great except the cmd prompt pops up and is visible to the user, I have heard about running powershell scripts with the hidden window flag but I dont know powershell well at all. Does anyone have some suggestions on an avenue for this. We are using individual machines so I dont have a way to manage these pcs but at an individual level hence no domain based GP. Thanks!

 I'm repurposing some laptops, so that they can be used by another user.
 First one: I log in as a local admin. I disconnect the computer from Azure Active Directory. But I still see the former user's files in C:\Users\HerUsername.
 I proceed to manually delete that directory, so that the next user won't see them (yes, they'll be a local admin, and yes, we will discuss that, but in a later post!).
 After those files are deleted, User comes to me and says all of her documents just disappeared. And two other users tell me that their Sharepoint library's files have disappeared.
 After a mild panic attack, I restored everything, except files that had been modified that day (Onedrive only restored up until last night's files).
 So, I gather that:
 Even after disconnecting from Azure, files that were synced to a computer are still there, AND if I manually delete them, they get deleted everywhere??
 Is this by design? If so, how can I un-design it?
 How am I supposed to transfer a laptop to a different user (again, for now, they're both local admins)?
 Many thanks!

Like the title says, we are trying to establish a 10gb link to another site via our ISP. The issue that we have run into is, our 10gb link is active and working, however we are only able to pass 2gb of traffic because all traffic going to the handoff device is coming from a single source mac address. Since it appears to be one source device, our ISPs link policing is forcing a 2gb flow limit. Would the best way forward be to add some sort of load balancer between devices that splits the single flow from the our device into 5 individual flows so that we can appropriately take advantage of the 2gb flow limit? At a loss here.

We already do the 3-2-1 backup strategy in house but I have no problems with another layer of backup if it's not my money. However, the MSP is forcing us to buy 100 seats of Sophos because they claim it's unsafe to backup and restore any data without it. The stuff that will be backed up resides on a Synology NAS available on the LAN via SMB only. We currently use Huntress and Defender on our PCs. 
 I told them OK if you think Sophos is better than our current EDR that's fine, we can install it on the one PC that will be used to administer the MSPs backup and they can scan the NAS share. They said no we need Sophos on all the PCs or they will not agree to backup stuff via Cloudberry. I told them I don't agree with this approach and to get approval from the people signing the checks. 
 I would like any opinions regarding the validity of their claims that 100 Sophos licenses are needed to make a Cloudberry backup of a NAS "safe" despite having already having Huntress and offering them 1 PC with Sophos to scan the SMB share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry, not sorry for the clickbaity title.
 But IMO after I had an opportunity to truly digest Service Mesh, I’ve always felt it to be similar to traditional VPN technologies.
 Folks may disagree here but hear me out for a second.
 Today’s set of VPN tech is plentiful, we have IPSec, wireguard, overlays like Geneve, and other proprietary solutions that connect two disconnected networks. But from Layer 3 (4) and below. 
 So service mesh enters the chat and addresses connectivity but at L7/HTTP. Tunnelling exists through mTLS, and Istio/Linkerd have their way of making this possible. Side-car proxies act as routers on behalf of containers pods and terminate at another side-car
 But what else does a service mesh do? - rate limit (qos) - traffic shift - load balance - filter by http request type - give us tracing and observability thanks to b3-header info (L7 traceroute) 
 Of course there still needs to exist a TCP (and below) layer for all of this to happen…
 And DNS.
 So my two questions: 1. Why am I not seeing more Networking Engineers embrace the likes of Istio/Linkerd? (Maybe I’m in some echo chamber)
  
How do you all feel about Service Mesh?
  
(I’m an ex-CCIE that pivoted towards Kubernetes.)

 I have no idea who they would contact, and when I tell them that they insist on getting my supervisor's name, who doesn't make that choice either. I'm a lowly sysadmin in the mountains of Colorado, these decisions are made by someone in Washington, DC, way above my paygrade.
 My contact details are public and it's easy to tell that I work for the Feds, anyone with half a brain should realize that they don't do vendor and product selection in the manner.

 Multicast IP: 224.2.127.254

 netsh interface ip add v4multicast "Cameras P1P2" 224.2.127.254 
 The commands are failing after "netsh interface ip add", with Windows telling me the only available commands that follow are: address, dnsservers, excludedportrange, neighbors, route, and winsservers. This has been stumping me for days, and hoping to get an idea of where to go next.

 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

 As I see it, a single forgotten service account could result in all other admins passwords' changed, and losing access to everything in Azure/M365.
 In my on-premises environment, if I have a set of backup tapes for all my data sitting on a shelf, I can (theoretically) always wipe all devices to bare metal and have everything restored, including identities, in the time it takes to copy the data. Cloud is not so simple. * Azure AD itself can't be restored, at least not with the same identities. If you lose control of a tenant, any identities are gone. And if you use Azure AD login and Intune with Bitlocker, your devices are all now wiped as well. Any configuration that depends on application configurations or managed identities needs to be rebuilt. Even UPNs wouldn't work, since you can't add the same domain onto a new tenant. * VMs in Azure can be backed up by any backup agent, but what about PaaS? If you're relying on Azure Backup/ Site Recovery, you just lost that too. Are there any good options for backing up files or blobs in Azure storage accounts? What about databases? Or Azure Key Vault? Azure Automation? * If you're using Azure services, you should be storing all your environment configuration in a code repository. But is it really all there? Have you tested a rebuild? And if you're using a cloud repository and logging in with Azure AD SSO, I have some bad news for you..... * For Office 365 data, much of it can be backed up, but can it be restored in a new tenant? Even tenant-to-tenant migrations with access to both tenants are spotty. In a new tenant, any identities are gone, and any permissions or groups would need to be rebuilt.
 Is there any product out there that claims to be able to restore your entire Azure estate, or should I just throw my hands up and hope it doesn't happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a MySQL database that's been happily accessed via T1 lines for years without issue. Now the internet provider has eliminated those lines and we are forced to rely on a Comcast cable connection (connecting via static ip).
 This works for most people, until it doesn't. Randomly (it seems) a remote user will not be able to connect. This has nothing to do with the number of connections (we only have like 10 users at any given time). Unfortunately this is the only internet access available in our area.
 I'm going to continue troubleshooting but just wondering:
  
Do other folks use Comcast/cable provider modem/routers to access SQL dbs and do they generally work?
 Would buying a newer, better modem/router be advisable?
  
Any input appreciated.

The entire email almost looks like one big picture of text and a QR code so I am not sure if Mimecast could read the impersonation attempt. 
 Does anyone have any recommendations on how to block emails like this? We have all of the standard policies configured, but I think this one got through because it is an image with a URL attached to it?
 Any tips are appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 The scenario is: You’re upgrading the domain controller to a newer version of Windows Server for some new infrastructure requirements. All workstations are Windows. No Azure AD in place.
 The problem is: Some end users that will need to be migrated to the new domain work remotely (not down the street remotely, but sometimes a few states away remotely). These users connect to resources over VPN, but the VPN authentication is tied to the domain controller that is going to be decommissioned.
 At some point during the migration the authentication of VPN is going to have to be redirected to the new domain controller. What I’m trying to nail down is what’s the best way/best sequence of steps to get all the devices on the new domain with the wrinkle of VPN being tied to the old one?
 There’s only about 15 or so people I’m dealing with, not hundreds or thousands. So even if the process is a little tedious, that’s okay. One thing I thought about is just switching the VPN (temporarily) to authenticate using some other method besides VPN before the migration starts, but I’m trying to see what all my options are.
 TLDR: upgrading/replacing domain controller, some users are offsite so their devices would be joined over VPN, but VPN auth is tied to old domain/domain that is going away. Need to figure out optimal way to do the migration.
 Any thoughts or resources would be appreciated?

 A little background, we do use one drive and sync data but I am looking for something that is a bit more transparent for me. I have run into issues in the past where that is setup in One Drive but it hasn't run in months. Also, we do use a VPN connection as well so people can access the data from the servers and drives remotely. 
 The issue I have is we are a Forestry Management company and the guys are literally out in the woods on a daily basis. There is no cell services or anything while they are in the woods. The need data on their computers when they are working out there and I want to find a way to make sure the data is being backed up. 
 I had an incident where I wiped and reloaded a computer and come to find out the user has data on the root of the C drive. I have since made sure he can't put data there but I have a feeling other users are doing the same thing because my predecessor gave users full admin access to their computers. 
 Has anyone found a software that has some type of console that will allow me to monitor when the last time data was copied or synced? Or any other suggestions?

 The 172.16.0.0/24 network is the client VPN address. It connects to a VPN server that has access to local VLANs 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.10.0/24 - this traffic is carried out correctly. However, the Wireguard server itself also has an IPSec tunnel set up to the 10.168.106.0/24 network and traffic from 172.16.0.0/24 to this network does not work.
 In the second phase of IPSec there is no client VPN class - 172.16.0.0/24 and I can't add it because I don't have access to the other side, so it can be done through NAT addressing 172.16.0.0/24 to any address that exists in the second phase, e.g. 192.168 .10.250 if traffic is routed to 10.168.106.0/24.
 Unfortunately, I don't know which iptables rules I should use to implement this.

 we are working on Azure Virtual Desktop with Windows 10 21H2 19044.2965.
 A few weeks ago, we installed an FSLogix Update and rebooted the server. 
 Since that day users complain about Errors in the Display of Text. For Example, there appears comma in a Name, or an "E" becomes a "D". Digits change too, good to see in Windows File Explorer when you have multiple Files named File - 1, File - 2, File -3. If i hover up and down on them the digits change to their neighbour value.
 This happens only if i RDP into the RDS-Server. If i connect via Remote Control Software, even in User Support Session i can the original text, no errors.
 This could cause devastating consequences. But i am not sure how to troubleshoot this error.
 Did you expierience a Bug like this?
 We use RDP UDP Shortpath, i disabled it temporarily but that didnt help. I think it could be a problem with some kind of Compression happening via RDP. But why after FSLogix Update..
 Should i contact Microsoft Azure Support about that? What would your next steps be?

 We currently utilize a VAR for our laptop fulfilments to field users. They do everything including print a Welcome Guide and put it in the box before shipping to the users. We execute about 5,000 deployments per year. We are looking to bring that function in-house. Among the considerations for us is how to make the best use of our physical office space when prepping 100s of laptops per month. I'd like for us to be able to "gang" all the laptops together in a dense physical arrangement and have access to the console via a KVM (keyboard video monitor) switch. 
 Is there a KVM that has dozens of ports that you may think about for this type of arrangement? Anyone in this subreddit doing anything similar and have ideas for efficiency?
 Thanks!

 I currently use date >> file.csv && speedtest -f csv >> file.csv
 That outputs the date on a separate line. I want the date on the same line as the soeedtest output. Also if the soeedtest fails to run I just want the date on the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 is it possible to run power cables and shielded ethernet in the same conduit?
 having it separate would require an insane amount of work (destroying 150 meters of courtyard)
 I do have a conduit of 25 meters in which I've to run:
 -4 PoE++ cables
 -2 PoE+ cables
 -380V 10kW (grid to laboratory) - this could be 220V if needed
 -380V 20kW (pv system inverter to grid)
 At my disposal I do have those 2 ethernet cables
 https://eu.store.ui.com/eu/en/collections/unifi-accessory-tech-cable-box/products/unifi-outdoor-cable
 and
 https://www.assmann.com/product-pdf/4016032344063?PL=en
 for what concerne power cables I still have to buy those and if there's anything that would allow to run both in the same conduit I'll get.
 which ethernet would be the most suitable? in case theres an ethernet cable better than mine let me know
 one end of the poe cables will be on cameras / switches while the other end will be on a server rack that is already grounded.
 patch panels in the rack is grounded, but most likely those cables will be directly terminated into unifi switch pro 24 poe.
 considering that the patchpanel is grounded and everything is made of metal is it fine to terminate those cables directly inside the switch?
 It would be ok to put another grounded patch panel in case its needed. I cant use tho the current one as it is already full
 Thank you

 We have a HPE DL380 Gen 10 with a 3 year base warranty. It should include 9x5 support with NBD Onsite Support and parts. We now have a defective HDD on the server. The HDD is an original part from HPE. But HPE now claims that the HDD only has a 1-year warranty and the 3-year server warranty does not cover this.
 In the past this was never an issue.
 Even the PDF for ProLiant base warranty states that additional parts are covered by the server warranty.
 A complaint to HPE did not help either.
 I think we will switch to Lenovo or Dell in the future. Working with HPE got worse and worse over the past few years for small partners like us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, hoping to get some info from PA experts from this sub.
 I am trying to understand how the self-signed certs on the Palo Alto gateway are trusted by the Global Protect client when they authenticate and sign in.
 Basically with one of our fw setups, the gateway has a cert that is self signed by the firewall itself. When we connect to the VPN, there is no ssl warning prompt for the cert being untrusted. 
 I have checked that the root CA (also self signed by PA) is not present on the client machines. 
 If this is the case, is there any significance of having this cert setup correctly? Does the client just accept the cert no matter the details.
 I have noticed, that when we first add the portal IP, there is a warning only initially but no warning when connecting to the gateway.
 I tried looking at docs but couldn't find what I was trying to understand here. Any info would be helpful.

 Also, there would need to be a way to avoid connecting in case the connected network is already the "target" network (don't need a vpn when you're on the right network already, you only need it if you're remote)
 Maybe that would require to install some kind of special very tiny "operating system" for that very purpose, all in command line which would execute the right instructions, anyhow I haven't been able to find yet what and how.

 Right now, our customer service department is storing the ID's in the customers ticket in a help desk platform, which I totally hate and I think it should never be stored like this..
 I mean, if someone gains malicious access to this platform or one of our employees decides to "steal" these documents, he will do it with no issues at all.
 I was wondering, should we maybe encrypt the received documents and store it encrypted? but then, how do I even achieve that? our customer service department will still need the ability to "view" and confirm the ID is valid, after they confirmed it's valid, what do I do with the file? I probably want something automated that let's the service agent the ability to view the file and I guess I can audit this to a log file.. then I also need a DLP solution..
 I would love to hear your thoughts about that and how you think I should work with customers personal documents & store them.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 Currently I am struggling with some weird behavior regarding windows permissions. The situation is as follows:
 We have a Windows Server, which serves as a small file-server. My user is part of the domain admins, which are part of the local administrators of the windows. There are multiple directories on the server and the local admininstrator group as well as the domain admins are permissioned on each folder and file.
 Now the issue: I am unable to change or create any file in those directories.
 It only works when I take ownership of file using my user. When I give ownership to Domain Admins or Local Admins it does not work again (And yes, my user is definitly member of the domain admins).
 Does anyone know why windows apparently can not handle groups on this server? For some reason it does no recognize that my user is member of the permissioned group.

 Microsoft recently added Windows Laps. Which made it possible to upload the local admin password to the Azure AD device object. Which is awesome.
 I have created a desktop app which will search up the device in azure that it's executed on and grab the password and show it to the user (if the user has access to read the property)
 I'm now also trying to make this app available for - Lets call them "power users" which i want to be able to get the local admin password only on the devices that they are owner of, not all devices.
 So, what I'm trying to achieve is scoping/ the API/Custom role to only grant the "power user" access to read the Local admin password on devices that they own/are primary user of.
 has anyone any idea on how/if i can achieve this?

 The problem is one of the Firewalls failed over (Cluster member didn't actually fail) and the backend load-balancer is still pointing to the Primary firewall (now standby) which is breaking lots of our ssl connection's understandably so
 We can just fail back however im wondering if its possible for the load balancers to detect HA state instead of probing if a member is alive

 small company and current sysadmin is letting me help a bit out with smaller stuff which is a lot of fun as I'm educating myself on the side. I'm trying to figure an issue out and usually my google is on point, but I can't for the life of me figure out where to start with the search. 
 We have multiple scan workstations on windows that need fast access to a NAS, producing thousands of folders with images on a daily basis. Current setup is old, not compliant with what we should have. Single user for all pcs that has domain admin and thus way too many rights for what that pc actually needs. But if I use a user without domain admin rights, the folder access speed to the NAS goes down dramatically to the point that a folder containing e.g. 80k subfolders doesn't pull the list fast enough for our software to work, thus crashing the workflow. With domain admin the entire folder is listed in a second or two, without it takes minutes to list.
 I'm at a loss what exactly handles this kind of file access and thus far only found out that domain admin grants the access speed and it's my goal to remove domain admin from that setup. Anyone kind enough to give me pointers where I could start looking?

AV, VPN, etc. My go-to stack is Crowdstrike for EDR, Twingate for VPN, and maybe something like Cloudflare or NextDNS for web filtering + wrapping some services to get all this set up, integrated, etc.
 Problem is — every time I present the estimated cost of everything, it’s always sticker shock.
 I get that companies are more scrutinizing of budget these days and want to save money. But if you’re running a bunch of open source stuff that your cousin built, you’re saving some hard dollars but probably costing way more in cost of someone babysitting that rickety stack, security risk of something configured wrong, etc.
 Anyway, I’m clearly doing something wrong because it’s hit or miss on getting folks to agree.
 How do you guys present your “business case” for tech upgrades like this? Do you build spreadsheets with potential cost savings, time savings, etc to show some kind of estimated ROI? If so, any templates you’ve found useful?

 I followed Google's DMARC documentation/guide precisely and added our DMARC record as follows in Cloudflare:
 https://snipboard.io/cCQTMY.jpg
 But mail-tester returns this result: https://snipboard.io/lZ8AHD.jpg
 How come the "Message has a DKIM or DK signature, not necessarily valid"?
 I followed what Google asked to the T. And yes I can see that the score deduction is only -0.1 but it still annoys me that the DMARC is potentially set up wrong.
 Also what does "SPF: HELO does not publish an SPF Record" mean? Again, I followed Google's instructions to add SPF precisely.
 Any and all help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I recently started in tech and am trying to educate myself. The company I work for has the marketing slogan "single pane of glass" network management but after reading through reddit feeds, this is a term people are tired of hearing.
 I'm sure most companies don't deliver on that term, making it gimicky and overused, but is there really a valid desire/need to manage through a single pane of glass? Many people I talk to are using 3-4 different vendors, so I'm wondering if it's not really a "pain point" to manage a bunch of different dashboards for different parts of the network or if people have just never experienced a true "single pane of glass" so they don't know what they're missing.
 For example, i'll hear: we're using palo alto for firewalls, mix of ubiquiti and meraki for wireless, and aruba and cisco for everything else...wouldn't that be annoying to manage all separately?
 Thankful for all thoughts and lived experiences shared!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering what you all use and have used in your campus networks for access switches, how they have been performing, what features they have, and the cost. I've been mainly using Cisco and I have found that I really just need a L2 switch with secure mgmt. If I could find a switch that just has basic L2 features and a few that might not be so common, that would be great. My access switches just provide connection to thin clients, VoIP phones, and printers, so I don't see a reason to spend money on cisco products and licenses if I can just buy something more simple. But then again I don't really know if Cisco is currently the most expensive route.
 Here's what I'm looking for in an access switch:
 -RSTP, (and MST if possible)
 -802.1q
 -LACP
 -PoE
 -SSH
 -SNMP
 Things that would be nice:
 -TACACS+ (or other encrypted mgmt aaa)
 -802.1x and or MAB support
 -HTTPS interface
 Just curious what is out there that might be cheaper. It seems like every time I put a new switch in place I just add the vlans, enable portfast for the hosts, configure username/tacacs, disable services, prune the trunk and if I'm feeling crazy double check the root bridge. I don't need VRFs, VXLANs, or GRE. I definitely don't need BGP or even OSPF lol 
 Let me know what you guys use for access switches.
 (I'm currently using Cisco 9200/9300s)

 Several of our clients do not provide company phones, and it's going to be a hard sell for several users and at least a couple of owners to "insist" they install the MS App on their personal phone for using company email.... Is anyone else running into this wall? And if so, how are you handling it gently enough to mollify the user, while still installing unwanted software on their personal device? 
 And before we go down the road of "Is it really that big of a deal?!?", two things: One, it's the principle of the thing for several users, and two: it's not like MS has a squeaky clean reputation for how they handle personal data, so telling the user "No, it won't get any information off your phone...." won't fly very high heheh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on a Kubernetes team where we manage 2 different distributions of K8s. We started our switch to the new platform at least 2 years ago. At that time we announced our end of support for the old one, but our users wouldn't move their apps. They have a ton of reasons, but it mainly comes around priorities and money. Since the original announcement, they've had 2 chances to setup their budget for the year to include the migration but many teams have just not bothered. We've gotten little to no support from our leadership even though we've been hit with a huge, multimillion dollar cost to keep extending support and licensing. They know we're leaving and are stuck, so they can stick us on the way out.
 We've alerted everyone to the fact that we are no longer doing updates to the platform and any security vulnerabilities need to now be tagged against the teams who refuse to leave rather than ours. We've also notified everyone that support goes away at the end of this year, even though we're already so far behind that we aren't supported anyway.
 What else can we do? I'm expecting our leadership to expect a Hail Mary if there is a production impacting outage even though we're ending up so far out of support it'll be a nightmare to fix. But we've got some mission critical apps running there.
 Anyway... this is sort of a rant, sort of an actual question.

I'm pretty familiar with WiFi but know when I'm out of my depth, I don't want to blindly throw APs at the problem. I suspect some sort of specialized/highly directional antennas will be needed to shoot down these long aisles, but I don't have the equipment to really verify that for sure.

 How do you handle users skipping the proper channels and reaching out directly to you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I assume this is not a problem that occurs in just IT, but it seems especially bad in this field.
 I posted a sysadmin job (local in person only sadly) and none of the people who have applied presented a decent resume. One of them literally had less than 10 words per job in their experience section. Not a single one mentioned scripting or automating. (yes, scripting experience is in the listing) One said "installed firewalls and AV software" What firewall!? Where!? What AV on what OS!? How many!?
 I can see some potential in a couple of the applicants, so i may extend an offer for interview, but is it socially acceptable to offer resume advice in an interview? I work for a small company and am not sifting through hundreds of applicants, but if i was i would 100% gloss over every one of these so far.

The machine connecting over OpenVPN errors as if the username and password is incorrect, the machine on a different subnet says I don't have permission to access the folder.
 What kind of settings do I need to look for when connecting like this as opposed to just on the same subnet? (the same configs work for the Windows 11 machine and a different Ubuntu Samba server both on 8 range).

 Ubuntu 22.04 server with Samba share & OpenVPN client (172.16.21.0/24) & Windows 11 client (192.168.8.0/24)
 Site B (behind non-pfSense firewall with OpenVPN server setup (OpenVPN works for normal LAN access))
 OpenVPN on 172.16.250.0/24 with Windows 10 client on 192.168.5.0/24

I've asked for a few quotes from a few resellers and they all came back generally the same. I expected that, its not that many devices, and negotiating regarding Apple equipment seems to be a non-question in general at this scale.
 The deployment is for only remote employees. I'm wanting to setup an MDM and ensure maintenance and processes are defined, tested, and documented within the two months I have to complete the project. I'm at the stage now where I can order some devices from a reseller I've been working with and make sure the auto enrollment and deployment works.
 My boss now wants me to look at a few other vendors to verify we're getting the best possible deal. I explained my concern regarding it being more important that our setup is clean and efficient in terms of management and deployment, but was told to hold off ordering anyways. Even at scoring something like 10% off its only going to save ~$2500. The idea that I have to redo my work with another vendor to integrate with ABM and setup drop shipping, waiting for the confirmation on their side, etc. to save that amount of money makes it sound like the more expensive option.
 Want to hear the perspective of other people and see what they do/how they would handle this. It feels like splitting hairs, but maybe I'm wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning,
 Small company with two offices and two sites in AD, both sites have a DC running DNS. The smaller site, lets call it site 2, with one DC and just five workstations had an issue over the weekend apparently, each workstation this morning after logging in had an error that they were connected to a new network and asking if they wanted to enable network discovery. Some said yes, some said no, some just left it.
 None of them can access the server by server name \\server2 and of course they only app they use accesses the server by server name.
 Did some testing, they can ping the server IP and it resolves, they can access the shares by IP address. Same thing is happening on the DC in this site. This also happens if they try to access a server by name in site 1. Everything in site 1 is fine by the way.
 Kerberos Event ID 4 is showing up on the server and the workstations. Did the suggested SPN duplicate search but didn't find any duplicates.
 What I did find was if I tried to ping the domain name it would return an IP address other than the server. It is actually just an IP address from the DHCP pool and not actually assigned to anything. This was happening on the server and the desktops.
 I went into DNS and removed that entry. At that point the server in site 2 started working and could access its own shares by name. Workstations could not so I rebooted them with no change. Rebooted server and it still works and so do a handful of the desktops. Some of the desktops still give the error and can't access by name.
 They give the same event id 4 in the event viewer with the name of whatever server we try to access. Ping is working on these workstations for both domain name and server name. IP and DNS info all look good. Not sure what to try to get these other workstations going. Hoping somebody has a suggestion.

 We are testing Intune, but don't think it does this. You can turn off notifications from Outlook, but still open and use them.
 If you disable mobile and OWA, can new Outlook still work or through portal.office.com.
 And can I still set up the default mail app on phones?
 Also, when Intune was setup they used the 6 digit pin, is there anyway to go back to 4 digit pins?
 I think its better to just make a policy that states "don't check or reply to email outside work hours." And not make mobile email more painful.

Zscaler

 Cisco anyconnect (Zscaler does the same Job)

 Last week I was pulled out to a location and found myself scrambling to find and then hook up a monitor. Got me thinking that its time for me to be serious about this, and look for something.
 I know in the past there is a lot of suggestions for pi-kvm-type items. But Im honestly just looking for a small monitor that does VGA/HDMI etc. When I go to some of these locations, there is a single computer sitting there, headless. 
 I carry with my a super small Logitech keyboard/mouse device, so thats taken care of, just need something awesome to have in my vehicle for these situations.
 Whats the 2023 suggestions to accomplish this task?
 Appreciate it all!

 I've been searching the internet for confirmation to this question, but I cannot find a concrete answer.
 I have a ProLiant ML350 Gen10 that we are adding more hard drives to. Currently, there is only one box that has hard drives installed, and that back plane plugs directly into the RAID controller.
 To install another box of hard drives, a SAS expander card needs to be installed. If I'm understanding this documentation correctly, I will install the SAS expander card, plug it into the RAID controller, then plug the back planes of the hard drive boxes into the SAS expander.
 My million dollar question is this: will the RAID that is currently running on the server survive the migration to the SAS expander?

 I'm looking for an application to manage AiO computer in kiosk mode. I don't need advanced options; basically, I just need to navigate through the Intranet. In theory, Windows Full Screen Kiosk Mode would be perfect, except for one thing - it doesn't allow to exit a PDF. Unfortunately, there's no way to bypass that. In theory, I could set up a Kiosk without Full Screen, but then I would have to block numerous websites, whereas with Full Screen, I set Intranet as the default page and people can't exit from it. Can you recommend any user-friendly and straightforward Kiosk apps for Windows?
 To be precise, I want the computer to be constantly running in Kiosk mode, and after a few minutes of inactivity, it should clear all data and return to the homepage. I have set the company's website as the homepage, and there is no way to navigate outside of it. You can only browse work-related news, log in to your profile to check your salary or remaining vacation days. And here lies the problem because employee data is generated in PDF format. The Kiosk with Edge easily opens the PDF, but there is no button to return to the previous page. One has to stand by the kiosk and wait for a few minutes until it clears the data and returns to the homepage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: Several win10 computers are presenting our radius server with the computer’s mac address as the “User-ID” when is should be the <domain name><FQDN> for 802.1x authentication. Our radius server is expecting a regex for the FQDN so fails dot1x but passes when the computer is MABed.
 Background: These computers are part of our parent org’s domain and cannot be re-imaged. They have been added ti the appropriate AD OU, assigned correct groups, etc. These computers are also receiving all our domain GPOs and have a machine certificate from our CA. We have no issues with our own imaged computers.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a lot of VM running at Proxmox VE
 Also, we have /26 network and VMs with IPs of this network.
 (We use OVH bare metal servers and network )
 One of those VMs used as a router/firewall for controlling the traffic of /26 network and has two IP addresses - X.X.X.123 and X.X.X.124.
 Trace to VM with IP X.X.X.111 looks like this:
 world -> OVH gateway -> X.X.X.123 -> X.X.X.111
 Trace from VM with IP X.X.X.111 looks like this:
 X.X.X.111 -> X.X.X.124 -> OVH gateway -> world
 So we have different interfaces for incoming and outgoing traffic.
 This was configured by adding a route:
 X.X.X.X/26 dev eth2 proto kernel scope link src X.X.X.124 metric 101
 From time to time traffic tries go throw X.X.X.123 ( eth1 ) instead of X.X.X.124 ( eth2 ) and all VMs with IP of /26 network lose acces to the internet. We can see this using tcpdump.
 This issue happened on Centos 7 and RHEL 9 now.
 After restart of Network Manager it works as expected but for a short time.
 Also, it works after moving router VM to another node.
 It starts about a year ago, but I still cannot find solution or even find a root of issue.
 So if you have any idea what it could be - please help me...

 I've been contemplating my career path in the field of infrastructure, particularly in Canada. Lately, I've noticed a trend where it seems like there's a significant number of individuals interested in infrastructure roles, possibly even more than in development. I wanted to gather insights from experienced professionals to get a better understanding of the current state of the infrastructure job market in Canada.
 I would appreciate your input on the following questions:
  
Is the infrastructure job market in Canada more competitive than the development job market? Or is it the other way around?
 Are there specific regions in Canada where infrastructure opportunities are more abundant?
 How has the demand for infrastructure professionals is evolving, especially in the cloud field ?
  
Please feel free to share your observations, personal experiences, or any valuable insights regarding the infrastructure job market in Canada. I believe this discussion will not only benefit me but also others who are navigating their career paths in this domain.
 Thank you in advance for your contributions and expertise!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, Reddit community! 
 Today, let's talk about Optimizing airflow and cooling in server racks. Here are some practical tips:
  
Organize cables: Proper cable management improves airflow by preventing obstructions. Use cable trays and ties to keep cables tidy. 
 
Hot and cold aisle containment: Separate hot and cold airflow paths using physical barriers like curtains or panels. This enhances cooling efficiency and prevents recirculation. 
 
Rack placement: Ensure sufficient space between racks to allow for proper airflow. Avoid clustering them too closely.
 
Blanking panels: Cover empty rack spaces with blanking panels to optimize airflow and prevent recirculation of hot air. 
 
Regular maintenance: Clean or replace air filters, check fan operation, and perform regular maintenance to prevent dust accumulation and ensure proper cooling. 
 
Ventilation options: Choose racks with perforated or mesh doors for better airflow. Consider adding fans or ventilation units if necessary. 
 
Temperature monitoring: Use environmental monitoring tools to track temperature and humidity levels. This helps identify areas needing additional cooling or adjustments.
 
 Remember to share your experiences and insights in the comments. Let's discuss how you manage airflow and cooling in your server racks!

 But for orgs who run only IP-sec (i.e MS AoVPN or similar), how often is that an issue in practice. 
 Lots of SSL VPN Vulns, and while SASE is an option, its also a very expensive one vs rolling basic to good ole Ip-sec - curious what the experince is like these days and if its as bad as the vendor FUD would let you believe.

 My brothers company provide a hotel for businesses in which his clients have access to the wifi and they even have a guest wifi.
 ​
 Oracle send him an email stating that there has been 6 downloads of VBox Extension under PUEL (license agreement) and that means it's for commercial use and he has to pay 6500 USD for licenses. If we don't they will perform audit and eventually law suit which of course the business hotel will have to pay for according to Oracle.
 ​
 My brother is concerned and don't know what to do. They can't identify who did it on the network as people can bring personal computers or log onto the guest wifi.
 ​
 It says on their site "By downloading, you agree to the terms and conditions of the respective license.".The extension pack is under the PUEL which states that you are not allowed to use it for commercial use. Can he argue that it has not been used for commercial use as it was downloaded on personal PC's? Do they have a way to see how it's being used. This is in EU btw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today is the last day you can buy a Windows 10 license. Though Windows 10’s time is coming to an end, Microsoft says its last-gen operating system will remain supported with security updates until October 14, 2025.
 We already knew Microsoft will no longer sell Windows 10 licenses, as it posted notices in multiple places online notifying users that it will end digital downloads of Windows 10 on January 31, 2023. Back in June 2021, the company announced it would stop supporting Windows 10 in 2025.
 Recently, the Redmond-based tech giant pulled the plug on the last remaining support for Windows 7. It also ended support for Windows 8 and 8.1. It’s easy to see Microsoft’s end goal, namely to make Windows 11 the only Microsoft operating system you can officially buy. Then checkout (Microprokey).

Per ip/connection load sharing is straightforward. But I can't find anything relevant for per-packet steering. Any clues, hints?

 I have already setup Dual WAN using TPLINK-ER605 where, WAN and WAN 1 are used.
 Load balancing is enabled where, WAN is Primary WAN and WAN1 is Backup WAN.
 Problem:
 I performed several test where I found that, when the Primary WAN was removed it took around 30-40 seconds to enable the Backup WAN. And again, when the Primary backup was inserted back it took around 1 minutes to restore the Primary link.
 Solution ?
 1.Can any body has been through the similar test before and found the same result?
 2.Is there any other process or settings that I can minimize the backup wan enabling time and primary backup link restore time?
 Thankyou in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an ex penetration tester. After working for 10 years at various companies I found that many of them do things the old way to keep charging clients more and on a per day basis.
 A couple of years ago, I resigned and went about creating my own penetration testing and fixed the issues below.
 ​
  
Unlimited free re-tests: Current penetration testing companies charge you twice, once for the penetration test, second time (or more for re-tests). I built a model that offers unlimited free re-tests
 Scoping: I built an algorithm that automates most of the scoping process so now you can get quotes automatically for most standard projects. No need to wait days for a quote
 Reporting: I've created a system that generates the final reports immediately when the test is done, need to wait 10 working days for a final report..
 Crowd Testing: Some clients want several penetration testers to have a look at their targets but most pen testing companies can't accomedate that. With my setup, I can assign as much as 10 penetration testers to each project
 24 Start: I've setup our penetration testers and team in a way that allows me to start a penetration test in 24 hours no matter the time of the year. This helped with clients that need urgent work
  
​
 Now I'm at a point where I want to invest and improve things for everyone even more but was wondering what issues you guys have faced during penetration testing that you would like fixed.

 The company has directives to do heavy savings across the board (not just IT). On IT side there's announced initiatives to move from VMware to a precieved cheaper solution.
 As part of a big recent re-org, multiple "OKRs - Objective Key Results" are at put on all teams, and many of them includes cost saving (nothing odd considering that financial situation). I'm in charge of following up some of those ORK in our team. One such objective has this exact phrasing:
 ​
 "Reduce VMware team size (xx% of our total costs) as we will have less and less VM (customers will go on XX)"
 ​
 Now to the main essence behind this post:
 ​
 Cost savings and new vendor migrations aside (they need to be simply accepted), I just find it outright bizarre to be asked, as a technical team, to "help us rationalize yourself away". It's clearly management topics.
 What's your take on this? Management is taking the easy way out to not work on the reduction plans themselves in my eyes.
 Time to update Linked-in? :D :P

 This is my first post, so I'm a bit confused. I have been working in the web hosting industry for over a decade and currently hold a position as a Technical Support Staff, specializing in Linux System Administration, for a well-known company. It's a great company with excellent management, and I have a very supportive supervisor. Overall, I love this job and excel at it.
 However, I feel that the compensation is not sufficient, and I am considering relocating to another country in the near future. I understand that my current salary may not be adequate in the new location.
 My expertise lies in web hosting support, particularly with cPanel, DirectAdmin, and related areas. I would like to broaden my skill set to pursue a higher-paying job. If you have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate hearing about the field you chose and any advice you may have regarding additional skills I could learn alongside my current role. I also have proficiency in Bash scripting and troubleshooting WordPress, and I can develop basic websites. However, beyond that, I have limited experience. I have attempted to learn a few programming languages, but given my age (currently 32), I am uncertain if programming is the right fit for me. Are there any other areas I should consider learning alongside my Linux System Administration and Technical Support role?
 I appreciate your time, opinions, and any advice you can provide.
 Thank you.

 Looking for some discussion on what the thoughts are on user local admin rights. 
 Currently we are using something called MakeMeAdmin, This allows users to elevate permissions to install and do admin activities on their machine. The biggest downside to this, is there is no way to track what is being done.
 I had the idea of using our MFA solution and CrowdStrike Identity. What my idea was, grant users admin rights to their local machine, but put a policy in place that makes them confirm an MFA prompt from DUO when elevation is requested. I still don’t think there is a way to track what is being done, but I can track who is using admin rights, and how often. 
 I’d love to discuss what everyone’s thoughts are or if there is an even better way to handle this?

 ​
 I am trying to read files from an old Micropolis 1588 SCSI disk. I have a SCSI card setup on a XP machine and it worked fine when reading a somewhat newer SCSI disk 3,5 inch. 
 Harddrive: Micropolis 1588
 SCSI Card: Tekram DC-395UW
 I have it connected with the 50pin cable, no terminators. The hdd spins up and is detected and shows up as Id 0 in Tekram screen when booting up. But nothing when in windows. What am I doing wrong? 
 Do I need to set jumpers for termination?
 Change settings for the Tekram SCSI card?
 ​
 Appreciate your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We have a customer that we are taking care of his BGP peering needs by using our Cisco ASR router running IOS-XR. In order to do so we configured a VRF instance and local-as within the VRF's BGP configuration (it's a special case and normally we do not do this).
 Unfortunately, using this setup our own AS number gets involved in the AS-Path, ie instead of having an AS-Path of 12345 12345 12345 (with prepending), we have an AS-Path which looks like 12345 56789 12345 12345 12345 (with 12345 being the customer's AS and ours being 56789, of course these are not the real AS numbers). The BGP peers do not like this, so they reject it in their BGP filters.
 Is there any way to workaround the above issue with IOS-XR? I 've spent a couple of days researching this, but could not come up with any solution. Thanks for your time.
 Best regards,
 G

All the guides I'm reading on FSLogix talk about using Azure Virtual Desktop. Is it possible to use FSLogix and store the profiles on-premises? 
 Edit to add: Is it also viable to do this in an environment that primarily uses physical desktops, and virtual machines pretty much only used as servers?

I’ve interview for technical positions in the past and once for a director position but it was just myself and the candidates, not 5 other people ( I hate interview panels..) When I’ve interviewed in the past, I tried to keep it more of a conversation, I feel like this isn’t possible in a panel type interview.
 We’re given a list of a dozen questions that we have to ask (split between us,) no idea what they are and then we do a round table of questions to ask our own questions - I have no idea what everyone else is going to ask - I recommended we set up a pre meeting to discuss but it wasn’t well received ( the interview is already scheduled for 4 hours…) 
 So, I’m trying to create a list of engaging questions I can ask.
 If you were in my shoes, what would you ask?

Or is it decided on a case by case basis? Or does it really matter? I didn't think it did for many years but have recently run across a couple cases where we inconsistently used a mix of EXE and MSI installers for products. Now we are trying to upgrade those products using one consistent method but the MSI upgrade won't update software installed by EXE, and vice versa. It's making quite a mess as we sometimes end up with two installs each.

 We have a 3 Node Cluster, first two installed in 2020, with the third installed in February. The disks in the third node are Samsung Evo 870s, with the disks in the other two Samsung Evo 860s.
 Two weeks ago, we had three disks in the third Node fail and we're unable to get 870s as a replacement as these are no longer being made. As a result, we've sourced 4 brand new enterprise grade Samsung SSDs.
 We've managed to retire the first drive, however, it gets stuck when trying to remove it from the storage pool. We think this is because it's still trying to do a Volume repair due to the dodgy disks. So it gets to 89% then goes back to the beginning and is in an endless loop trying to remove the disk from the storage pool.
 We've moved all VMs off the third node, but we're unable to pause the Node due to the problem with the disks...
 What is the best way forward, just pull the disks out and replace them or forcibly evict the Node from the Cluster?
 We don't want any corruption or problems though.
 Any advice greatly appreciated.

 The onprem side is behind NAT, so the required ports are forwarded. Everything works great, but what I cannot understand is, how do my other network devices know how to find the tunnel? Presumably packets destined for AWS must be directed to the Strongswan VM which in turn knows the route, but by what mechanism are packets arriving at the Strongswan VM in the first place?

 They said after a storm the fiber stopped working so they are using ubiquity wifi external antennas instead to connect the two buildings.
 After I replaced a couple of smaller unmanaged switch in my building with a new larger managed switch I poked around and found the fiber to copper converter wasn't getting any power. Found the plug the power brick for the converter was dead.. Plugged it into another plug and got power.. Yay
 So now I get the the copper cat 5 plugged into my laptop and get the hoped for activity lights blinking and the gigabit connection light as well.. But just get unidentified network on laptop
 I Plug it into the switch instead
 The switch shows the port change to UP state and I again have activity and Gb connection
 Port shows its up but no ip or any connection info/network.
 Still have to investigate the other side the fiber connects to the switch in other building But, it gets a connection and there is all lights blinking as if there is traffic flow 
 Not sure where to take this beyond checking other end connections. 
 Even if signal sucked due to messed up fiber, if it detects a gb connection and shows traffic, I should have at least spotty network connection no? 
 Any suggestions welcome! 
 Thank you!

 Debian 10
 Client:
 Windows 11
 I use my file server as a no-authentication access terminal in my computer room. I'm not worried about someone one coming in, joining the network, and downloading my stuff. If anything, being able to easily do that is great since the few times people do want to do it, those people have no idea what a hard disk is, more or less what Samba is.
 I've been using Samba for years now, but I heard that NFS has less overhead and wanted to try it out. It was easier to set up and get running. It took me longer to get Windows set up to read the share then to make the share.
 I did the anonyms registry for User and Group since I'm not overly concerned about security.
 Now the issue (in windows) is that if I leave a window (or a panel in Double Commander) pointing anywhere in the share and then come back after a minute or two, it hangs for about 8 seconds before resuming.
 Is this normal for NFS shares, or did I misconfigure something?
 The feedback from windows mount;

 Site goes down completely, so no visibility inside at all. Spent some time coaching the service desk to get some trace routes and pings from the users, photos of router status LEDs and checking with the ISP for known service outages in the area.
 Too much time goes on we decide to just get a contractor / tech hand out there to console me in to the router via a remote connection to their laptop.
 There are four built in switch ports on the router and two of these are configured, one for LAN and one for WAN. I'm consoled in now, router is not dead, good. But WAN interface is down. I can see LAN is up then I notice another port that is up and is not configured.
 Check logs, it came up about the same time the WAN went down.. I ask the tech to move what ever is in that port to the WAN and.. boom, sites back up.. someone had literally moved the WAN cable into another port!! WHY?
 I tell the tech to ask them who has been in here (comms room) today, who was in here at the time network went down, why are they moving cables.
 The site managers response was "well the wifi was running slow and that happens sometimes and what we do is we just move this cable from one port to another it comes good again".
 WHAT
 No, seriously, in a technical sense it is completely impossible. I even reviewed config backups for a sanity check. There has only ever been one WAN port. What the heck man. 
 ​
 TLDR site manager troubleshooting site wifi decided to move the WAN connection on their router to another port.

I'm not thrilled with the mgmt style and I think they're just trying to load their pockets but... I'm interested to see how they migrate and implement the different technology.

 I've been making notes of these Windows updates errors and they all have something in common, I can't seem to fix them and get the systems back into a state of functioning updates. No matter what I've tried they persist and prevent some or all of the updates from installing.
 there are the errors that change like 0x80070424, 0x800703ee etc...
 I have tried running all malware antivirus scans and there is no foul play to my knowledge.
 Here's what I've tried:
  
Running dism to repair it (even with a extracted new windows image file)
 Running sfc /scannow
 installing window from flash drive on another pc and hard reset and everything
 Cleaning the C: drive and temp folder
 Removing old updates and trying to re-run updates
 Manually downloading window
 3rd party programs like reset windows update tool and sfcfix
 Updating/uninstalling/reinstalling Microsoft's redistributables and runtimes
 i have reset pc for like 6 times
 Ive tried running the troubleshooter, and running a windows update repair
  
I'm fresh out of ideas and I've been researching these issues for 3 days
 I wish there was some way to fix and is there any fix to this problem and thank you in advance please

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scenario:
 One Windows 11 PC ("Win11") and one Windows 10 PC ("Win10") on a LAN. Accounts under the same (admin) name ("Userguy") on both devices. RDP is properly configured on both devices, and a login preset (Username: "Win10\Userguy", password: "3xample") has been set up on Win11 to login on Win10. These credentials work when entered manually.
 Issue:
 When trying to RDP from Win11 into Win10 from a shortcut or selecting Win10 from the dropdown in the RDP interface, the login always fails and a window opens to enter login details. In the window the default user name reads "Win11\Userguy" instead of "Win10\Userguy", which then has to be entered manually again, and the right password. Which work fine. But even when saving these credentials, the next time the issue happens again.
 Edit:
 After doing a manual save of the preset, it now seems to properly save the username ("Win10\Userguy") but the login still fails and I am dumped in the Windows Security dialogue ("Your credentials did not work") which asks me to enter the correct credentials. Now the default username reads "Win10\Userguy" but if I just enter the password I am returned to the Windows Security dialogue ("Your credentials did not work"), and only after using "More choices" and entering the credentials again (username and password) does the login succeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a weird one. We've setup a new Dell PowerEdge server to replace an old Small Business Server. It's a decent spec machine with 64gb memory and 4 x SAS SSD (with the higher end RAID card) running Windows Server 2022 Std.
 The server feels really solid and quick when its running and setting it up we've had no issue. However at some unknown point it's started taking a crazy long time to boot, like 40 - 45 mins. It just sits on the spinning circles forever although you can access file shares on it during this time and some other functionality is working.
 I've checked the logs and a large number of the services seem to be timing out while starting. There doesn't seem to be a pattern though and they are all kinds of different services covering different things. When the server finally does boot, the following services are stopped:
 Distributed Transactions Coordinator
 Diagnostics Policy
 Network Access Policy 
 But if you click to start them, they seem to startup without issue and once it finally loads it all runs without issue and seems 100% fine.
 The server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, File/Print and NAPS roles.
 It's an absolute nightmare to debug because I make a change then have to spend 45 mins waiting to see if it works. There doesn't seem to be any errors other than the services are just timing out with the error "A timeout was reached while waiting for <service>.
 Anyone seen this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've been searching around this section for recommendations on storage switches to be used for iSCSI SAN traffic.
 My environment is fairly easy with gigabit ethernet HP 2530 switches for SAN to Hypervisor connectivity.
 Usually I have 3 VMware hosts connected to two HP 2530 switches and going to compellent or powervault SANs.
 Our environment is mostly HP/Aruba and it would be easier for me to work with.
 I'd like to have 1/10GbE capabilities and 24 ports per switch should suffice.
 I've inherited this network so how it currently is configured with the existing 2530s was not my design.
 I do recall when working with VMWare support, we realized that the buffer on the 2530 was too low and was potentially impacting some performance.
 I guess I'm am not entirely sure what I should be looking for. As I have the option to standardize our sites, I think using Aruba will still be a good option, but I'm all ears.
 Ethernet or SFP should be fine, I would be looking at deploying 1gb while we wait for hardware for 10gbe connectivity.
 Any suggestions on what I should look into? I believe that buffers are critical for SAN switches but aside from that, I'm not sure.
 Thank you

No combination of firmware/settings seems to be correct. A change may correct one issue but then either introduce a new issue or make a pre existing issue worse. 
 I am getting to the point where I want to throw in the towel on fortinet wireless and swap to another product line. 
 I know I am going to get lots of different answers. Which wireless vendor is best for simple Wi-Fi network deployments? Trying to get something where I can set it and forget it and stop getting complaints from users on a weekly basis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ohai, I figured all of you are in the situation of "being the computer guy" in your families, and would know a good tool.
 I hadn't touched gotomeeting since mid 2010's, and what it is now is too overwhelming for the guy I'm trying to help. Back in the day, it was just "Open thing, here's the meeting code, click ok till we're in a meeting, hit share screen, hit give control." Now it's prompting for accounts, has the whole zoom presenter-isms, attendee popups, and overall so much noise that I couldn't guide him into actually getting his screen successfully shared.
 So like, before I have to get in the car and drive 3 hours to go setup a RealVNC server on this guys box, do you have any better tools to recommend? I'm not on his network/not vpn, his machine is Win11 Home (no inbound RDP). Absolute minimum popups/clicks to get into the meeting is like my only concern, they panic whenever anything pops up, at all =p

However, when anything is printed, such as Word documents, PDFs, etc., it only prints in red and not full colour. The printer is not the issue, as another device prints perfectly. I have checked the settings, and they all appear to be the same as the other devices. Although, in the settings, one button for colour options is greyed out (sorry, I don't have a screen grab). Can anyone suggest a simple solution besides reimaging the PC?

 But before anyone stopped to consider asking for an API exception for bots and apps, were just protesting by having subreddits going dark temporarily/permanently on the basis that we wont have some third party app and accessibility features. which is not effective without negotiating for special app/bot exception for the API alongside the protests.
 Unless all these protests are secretly to keep API free to allow for free LLM training. Who is really behind the mass protests as AI has not been mentioned at all in the big subreddits protests/going-dark posts.
 99% of people don't realize the API changes are meant to disallow big AI conglomerates to easily scrap reddit to train AI on our data for profit
 I dont want my data to be used to train a LLM, only to be charged to use this LLM when it comes out.

The company appears to have gone bust, likely some time in March. The records remain available but there is no way to log in and update/change anything nor do they respond on email/phone. I've had to fight my way around getting the domains transferred to other hosts this week so wanted to drop a note out as a heads up for others who may be in the same boat but not realise it yet.
 They are a reseller of enom.com for .com domains and they would help for those. For .co.uk Nominet will assist with getting you access to your records.
 If you are impacted, good luck and may you get records migrated with minimal fuss.

 were currently having an issue where our vdi-on-thin-client users (windows 11) keep losing their printers when the vdi restarts/shuts down periodically (for whatever reason im not yet sure). we havent figured out how to make printers and the general state (bookmark, preferences) persistent via group policy and/or vmware horizon config. 
 However, this issue is not happening for all users but consistently occurring for the same users 
 Also it seems printers are only lost during local restart. when admin remotely restarts users’ vdi, the printers are not lost (a theory based on a couple examples)

 I'm going to struggle to explain this, but ill do my best.
 We have the below set up 
 Cisco Router -> Fortinet -> 2 x Aruba -> 2 x legacy netgear switches 
 I'm aware that the Fortinet is set up as DHCP server which give out a range 10.157.....
 but when I connect to the Netgear switches they hand out 192.168.000 
 I think the netgears switches are running a DHCP service on them which is handing the 192 range out, but my question is 
 Why are the Arbuas not pulling an IP range from the netgears and or vice versa?

 But now i want to make 5 secure folders. Do i just disable inhertiance on these 5 sub folders, remove DomainUsers group and add security group (with correct users in).
 I have access based enumeration on Data_Shares so it's going to hide the folders for anyone not in. Just want to check that's the way to go disable inhertiance on the selected sub folders?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to find a solution to a weird issue I've been having for a few days now, and this is my last hope. I've got a pair of SRX340 firewalls which I acquired in order to replace a pair of dell R330 boxes running PFSense. The goal here is to use them just for an IPsec tunnel into our GCP environment.
 As a precursor, the current PFSense boxes are in operation with one GCP tunnel each, sharing a GCP VPN gateway. When I run an iperf test over them, I can get up to 600mbps per tunnel. Plenty for what I need.
 However, when running a simple configuration in a test environment using the Google community guide for SRX devices, I'm only getting ~230mbps of possible bandwidth over the firewall. To be clear on this example, it's one SRX340 with one tunnel to GCP, dynamic routing, a gigabit WAN connection with a static IP on ge-0/0/0, and I have a laptop plugged into ge-0/0/1 on the device to run iperf3 over. Without the SRX340 in the mix, I can get 930mbps iperf3 over the internet to my test VM in GCP.
 My issue is with the 230mbps number. The SRX340 is rated for up to 733mbps of IPsec bandwidth, and I'm running the configuration given as an example in the Google guide. I just can't seem to break that speed barrier. Am I missing something or is this what I'm to expect out of an SRX340?

 Tiny resume:
 Reedit is changing its API price (up to 20 million $ per year) to the third party apps that offers accessibility to ddisabled people, no ads, no porn, and also it offers better tools for subreddit moderation, things that the official reddit app doesn't.
 Basically the blackout consist in going "dark" 2 days, from 12th to 14th. (or indefentely, some communities like r/ProgrammerHumor prefers to go dark indefentely)
 I hope this doesn't break any rule, if so mods please feel free to delete my post but at lease consider what people is gonna vote. 
 Since we are sysadmins, i think we could join this blackout, we know how much painful can be this type of things irl, so i think we could join them.

 I am facing a terrible delay when connecting from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 20.04 via Windows Remotedesktopconnection. My download speed is 60-80 Mbps and upload 20-30 Mbps. Ping to the remote machine says 25ms. I've tried to do some configurations on Remotedesktopconnection window such as colour depth, bitmap caching etc but no success. Writing code has a delay of 0-0.5 seconds and opening folders with >100 images takes 1-3 seconds. Opening or just dragging a single image takes 1-3 seconds as well. I do not own the remote machine so changing configurations over there might be limited. Is this sort of delay a common issue when trying to connect a windows 10 with a ubuntu 20.04 machine? Should I consider switching to windows as well for my remote system?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Seeking opinions. I'll keep out some of the details to keep it short. I need to get a redundant/backup internet carrier at a very important site for our small/med enterprise. It is a warehouse location. The wrinkle is that we are leaving this site in approximately one year, but up until that time it is crucial that if one ISP dies another is available. Our current provider is actually the cable company, who has an enterprise fiber division. The only other provider in the building is the legacy RBOC who has fiber.
 I have been getting quotes through a telco broker who works with multiple different companies that use the RBOC as the last mile/loop, but they either refuse to quote 1 year or the pricing is very high (over $1000) even for speeds like 50 or 100Mb. I have looked at satellite internet services which seem too slow. I have looked at 5G broadband, but my hesitation is that they seem to offer no guarantee as to speed or performance. The fine print literally says there is no minimum speed. I need at least 50Mb up and down to run the business in the event of a failover. Another option is business (not enterprise) class cable modem, from the same provider as my current service. I inquired about redudnancy/separation between the two services, they did not get too deep into detail but admitted that they did potentially share some of the same equipment.
 So what would you do?
 A) Get the wireless broadband service, and hope it doesn't suck horribly when needed
 B) Get the cable modem and hope the services don't ever go down at the same time
 C) Bite the bullet and try to convince ownership that we should pay the $1000 per month for the backup service, which is more than we pay for our primary service. The internet in this location has not gone down for at least 5 years, but if it did and we didn't have a working backup it would definitely cost the company more than $12,000 if it was down for a day.
 Thanks

There’s only 3 of us on the team so we are on call frequently. On top of this they ride our ass about phone calls. If you miss a phone call you’re getting chewed out. We also have maintenance monthly on Sundays which means once a month I’m giving up my Sunday. 
 I really like what I do but these after hours calls and the frequent on call is wearing me out. Is this a normal aspect of the job that I have to get used to or is this unique to where I work. Thank you!

 I've been playing around with Netbox to demo, and I've been importing our addressing and VLANs. My concern is with how VLANs are handled. It seems like it's not possible to say "vlan 1 is globally Desktops,' for example, and have all org-wide site-specific Desktop prefixes be assigned to, and appear under, the same VLAN object. Is this correct? 
 Right now I have (for example) a "site_vlans" vlan group for multiple sites, and an individual "vlan 1" assigned to each group/site. This is all well and good, but suppose you have 100 VLANs and 10 sites. Are you required to maintain 1000 VLAN records in Netbox? Seems unwieldy.

 I'm currently a student in admin/sys and I'm working on a projet in my internship.
 This projet is about the auth reinforcement in general.
 Currently we're using Kerberos and the CIO wants to put a RADIUS server instead (+ 802.1X.)
 I've a given solution but for my thesis and as a beginner I'm trying to figure it out why would we replace kerberos by a RADIUS.
 And more I search and more I'm convince that Kerberos is better ??
 (info we are 250 people)
 For now I found that :
 Kerberos in highly secure, provide two factor auth, SSO
 And for RADIUS honeslty I mainly found that it's "easier" to manage, no really technical advantage.
 I'm really trying to have an critical POV about this to justify the need to replace kerberos, and first I tried to answer the question "Why would I build up a central server with all credentials ?"
 Because it's what mainly I understood about RADIUS and I thought I'll found instead "this is an hyper secure proven solution" and not just some "easier to manage" stuff.
 And I'm bewildered... 
 Maybe I'm wrong or not considering the real need ?

 So, I manage a hotel's Wifi service. A recent change I made for them was to set their QoS bandwidth cap for their free GUEST wifi network to 10Mbps. After applying the update, I went to the hotels lobbies to test it out with my laptop. Interestingly enough, I'm getting on avg. about 4-6Mbps speeds and I'm also seeing that it will fluctuate from 5Mbps, then burst to 8Mpbs, then back to 4Mbps and so on and so on. I'm assuming this is normal behavior you see when you've placed a bandwidth cap on the wifi network, but I'm not 100% on this. If not, let me know.
 When I'm on the casino floors, I'm getting correct QoS speeds (The property is a hotel & Casino), I'm also seeing burst here and there but overall speeds are right on the money.
 Currently using Cisco WLC3504 with Cisco 2802i APs.
 This might be an easy answer for some of you Wireless Cisco ninjas. I appreciate any thoughts and inputs you might have.

Our concerns for sharing the common network devices with other systems are bandwidth, latency and security.
 As far as I know CCTV data is prioritized in MPLS QoS. Can our safety-critic data be prioritized higher than CCTV packets?
 Also in case of a failure in other subsystems, may a technician misconfigure the MPLS router in a troubleshooting process so that our routing configuration also be affected badly?
 I remember that with RSVP, pre-defined bandwidth can be allocated to a specific tunnel, can we rely on that?
 The good side of entering to MPLS network is that we don't need to spend a great amount of equipment cost to deploy our separate network. Also we won't need to worry for failures and maintenance.
 In case we decide to involve to MPLS network, we need some commitments from operator on bandwidth reservation and max latency we are going to experience, right?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am hoping to get some feedback on how to improve my HA setup between my active/passive FortiGates, and a Cisco Nexus vPC pair acting as the layer3 core. 
 Here is the topology with relevant config:
 https://i.ibb.co/hcmxVTs/Forti-Gate-Nexus.png
 Each FortiGate has two interfaces configured in an aggregate (ports 2 and 4). FortiGate1's ports 2 and 4 are plugged into Nexus1's ports 1 and 2. The same is done for FortiGate2.
 When I added the second Nexus, I initially tried connecting port 2 from each FortiGate into the same Nexus, and port 4 from each FortiGate into the other. However, this caused unexpected behavior. I can't exactly recall what happened, as there were a number of issues I was troubleshooting during this time.
 Fast forward a few months, I noticed Po5 was down on Nexus1, and Po4 was down on Nexus2. I removed these port channels and quickly realized this caused an outage.
 I have an opportunity for a maintenance window this weekend and would like to improve this setup if possible. Would anyone who has implemented a similar topology be willing to expand on their HA configuration?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a fairly simple network, outlined below. For the question in particular, two subnets in their own VLAN.
 I have a service running in VLAN1000, lets say it's a webserver. I have forwarded 443/tcp from my WAN interface to this machine, and it works fine from the outside.
 From VLAN5, however, it doesn't work properly. It requires either split horizon DNS or hairpin NAT. I'm currently using split horizon DNS, but that only works for machines were I can control DNS, which I can't for some computers. It also doesn't work with some services just using IPs.
 I'd like to implement a hairpin NAT rule which works with my dynamic WAN IP. I can't find any relevant documentation on this, but I'm probably missing something obvious.
 How do I implement this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: Apparently I needed to enable PFS on both sides. It's working now.
 I've been able to get a VPN tunnel established between an ASA 5555-X with Public Static IP Address and a Cisco RV320 which has a 4G LTE (Verizon) USB modem attached. It completes Phase 1 and Phase 2 setup of the VPN tunnel but I'm not getting any data to pass. The ASA side show #pkts encaps and #pkts encrypted counters increasing but the #pkts decaps never increase from 0.
 The RV320 shows its IP Address is 100.121.189.168, however that is not the IP I'm using to establish the tunnel. I'm using the address that I see when going to ipchicken.com. Of course, the RV320 doesn't have the best debugging/logging capabilities.
 Any ideas if this is possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this EXO Admin Center has had a new form for quite some time now, I avoided using it. I do like the interface but some of the functions are a step backwards imo.
 As an example, if I were to go give permissions to a shared mailbox, when I go to delegation and add, it completes and I have to close the window out, if I also need to apply send as permission, I have to go back into the mailbox to do so where in the "classic" admin center, everything can be done in the popup window without closing anything. This function is no longer available in the classic admin center.
 I know it's a minor annoyance and yes, I do use powershell more often than not to accomplish some of these tasks, I know Microsoft is gonna Microsoft but some of the changes are just so annoying. I think things like message trace are better here but overall, I don't know what they were thinking with some of the changes.

 We have have a large list of subnets which have a list of contacts that are responsible for them.

If there is an issue with a specific subnet a 3rd party contacts these groups/users to notify them about a problem with their subnet. What do you guys usually use or would recommend using for this? 
 We are currently looking at Nautobot as it supports Infoblox integration. But as far as I can tell it does not support users/groups for subnets either. Currently we are using an old database with basically all manual entry which is less than ideal. I don't know if what I am asking makes any sense to you guys but if not then please ask for clarification. I appreciate any help I can get on this.

 These computers have tons of available memory and and restarting the app doesn't help so I suspect there's some windows service I need to restart which outlook if relying on that is causing the issue.

 Do you know what service it is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 ​
 In the era of WFH and remote connections, I wanted to put this idea out to the community.
 ​
 What do you think of an auto-detecting VPN client? (or an auto-detect feature built into the vpn client)
 ​
 What I was thinking was:
  
The VPN client when connected would work as its supposed to with routing policies and things of that nature
 When the VPN client is not connected it would monitor traffic based on policies and rules and when it detects that the system is attempting to connect to a resource on the destination network that is only available through VPN it would prompt to connect
 The idea is that people would be able to stay off the VPN and only initiate a connection when its required.
 Further it would reduce IT helpdesk tickets because rather than logging an IT ticket when they can't access a resource, only to find they haven't connected to VPN, the client application would pop up with a notice "looks like you're trying to connect to your workplace, would you like to connect?"
 The user could click yes or no and if they click yes then it would initiate the connection sequence (prompt for password, mfa, etc.)
  
​
 what do you guys think? let me know in the comments

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who had admined Teams phones, you'll know that even with autosign in there are times the devices sign out. Users press buttons, bad updates happen, or in some cases they just seem to randomly sign out. Every teams admin I've ever talked to usually starts by confidently saying they don't have that problem before coming back later in the conversation and saying something similar to "Well we did have a few devices sign out but that was because the password expired" or similar. 
 If you're familiar with Kari's law the basic premise is that there can be no barrier whatsoever to dialing 911. If it's a phone, you should not have to dial an outside line or take any special action to dial. But if you look at a teams phone, every single one says "Sign in to make an emergency call"
 How is that legal? I genuinely do not understand how, or how people are getting around this. Surely if an organization is using teams as a phone system with physical phones they're non compliant with Kari's law? 
 What am I missing? Even with auto sign in there isn't a way to 100% guarantee a phone wont get signed out. 
 I get that there's other issues here that need to be addressed. The need for cellular backup in case the internet goes down, or backup power for the phone system. And yes, I fully understand 'most people just use their cellphones', but I'm specifically wanting to address teams phones in this context because the way I see it, there's no way to be compliant with Kari's law unless you have someone physically checking each and every phone multiple times a day, even if it's in the hallway rather than being assigned to a user.

A 39-year-old Florida man pleaded guilty Tuesday to selling hundreds of millions of dollars of counterfeit Cisco gear to unsuspecting schools, hospitals, government agencies, and the military.
 According to the US Justice Department, between 2013 and 2022 Onur Aksoy, based in Miami, founded at least 19 companies in New Jersey and Florida and launched 15 Amazon and 10 eBay storefronts from which he peddled "tens of thousands" of low-quality or faulty networking devices gussied up to look like new or official Cisco equipment.
 The goods, imported from sellers in China and Hong Kong, were often loaded with pirated Cisco software and packaged within Cisco boxes bearing Cisco labels and stickers. Documentation was also made to look legitimate, the Justice Department said.
  
I'm sure it will only be a matter of time before some of the big name suppliers start using this guy as a scare tactic to funnel sales back their way.

 Looking for help of the collective group as something surely has to exist already for this…
 We have an operations team that is 24x7. They respond and action to various alerts. My team has developed very detailed process on how to respond to these alerts (ex. device down). The process is currently documented in a flow chart and we’re looking at next steps to bring this to our Operations Team.
 I’d love to be able to have something that is user input driven - I’m imagining something web-based that prompts them for Yes or No / Choice A or B type inputs and then leads them to the next steps.
 For example…device down…. Is there an active change being performed by the Network Team or vendor? (Yes/No). Based on the selection the next input would be something like… IF No… Is it a single device down or multiple… and so on.
 I’d love this format over something like an incredibly long word document with anchors.
 Here’s an example of something that I found - albeit maybe really out and outdated(?) - that paints a picture.

 When dealing with an oversized transaction log file in Microsoft SQL Server, the following steps can be taken to address the issue when the shrink command does not reduce the file size:
  
Check the database recovery model: Ensure that the database is in the full or bulk-logged recovery model. If it is set to the simple recovery model, the transaction log will not shrink.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I have a 2012R2 server (Last one in production with update planned prior to soon EOL) which still has Flash Active X installed. KB4577586 has been set to install in WSUS for all device groups and has installed succesfully on all other servers and endpoints. 
 I've also tried manually downloading from the Microsoft update catalog but when ran i'm told "this update is not applicable on your computer".
 Anyone else had similar? Recent updates continue to install no issue including all monthly and the recent quarterly security roll-ups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a meetup with a friend from a previous job, one that I actually got to apply to the position via reddit, and he said he just got approved to block reddit starting on the 12th in the corporate firewall.
 I asked if he was only going to block it for a couple days as part of the blackout but apparently he got the permanent block approved by the VP. It won't be accessible on their internal network or their guest wifi, and he's expecting to piss off a few people with this change.
 We discussed setting similar blocks in our home networks for a couple days and seeing how we do - thought that might appeal to a few people here since it looks like this sub will be staying up. You might also consider setting up blocking at work as well if that's plausible. I work for a giant megacorp so I'm not even going to try, but having worked at some small places it's definitely something I would have put forth there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I stumbled over the new features that Microsoft tries to implement in Windows and Office 365. 
 Especially the "new" Outlook app. The "new" app looks basically Outlook.office.com but as a Modern app. Most Add-Ins didn't work like online and in general the app felt worse then the Web app. 
 A few days ago I heard in a webcast, that Microsoft probably does not continue the development of active directory which could result in an push towards Azure AD.
 Today I read about upcoming changes to the explorer and the "Home menu" looks like the start Menu from Microsoft 365. 
 This all feels like Microsoft wants to force users to get in touch with the existing cloud infrastructure and wants to push the cloud services more than only migrating Server VMs to azure. 
 This scenario is quite unrealistic, but I think this could be happening more in the future. 
 Does anybody feel the same way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everybody hello,
 Wednesday, a recruiter cab called me to asks if I was potentially interested in new offers. I told yes, then he told me he has a DevOps offer. So, I am working as system & network admin since 2.5 years in my company (its my first job, i'm 24). The thing is they were looking for an experienced DevOps, which im obviously not.
 So, they anyways wanted to meet me, yesterday eve I went to the company (~150 employees), they told me they were considering taking me as mid-time DevOps & mid-time sysadmin at the beginning to help me getting skills on DevOps, and after some months if needed, I would be a full DevOps.
 The point is they have also needs on sysadmin side, and Im pretty much experimented on sysadmin, so all of this sounds fair to me, the business looks nice, great office, great work schedule, everything.
 Does this offer sounds really fair? Is it a redflag? Is there something I should really be care of? Whats you guys opinion on it? (I am really about to accept)

 I have an issue with opendkim. The problem is that it allows emails without attachments from the sender, but it blocks emails with attachments from the same sender. The sender is using O365. It's possible that the headers are changing somehow after the attachment is added, dunno. I tried adding the sender's domain to the trusted host list, but the issue still persists.
 thoughts?

 I've been in it for 5+ years and I'm about to take my CCNA test. My current job, I have no access to the network and I have only been there for 5 months.
 So my question is: If I pass my CCNA test, should I start looking for a job that needs a network guy or stay for a year or two so employers don't question why I'm hopping my job so fast? 
 Thanks for your advice
 Ps: my ultimate goals to be network security with azure administration sprinkled in.

 First problem, if I am booted to WinServ2019Essentials, the WSB times out when looking for a backup on the USB drive.
 So I boot via USB and chose recover, it takes about 2 hours to scan the USB for a recovery file, it finds it and then when I say to execute it I get error "The system restore has failed. No disk that can be used for recovery can be found"
 Now the internet has a variety of answers, from WSB is deprecated and won't work, all the way to attempting to partition and format the drives exactly as they were.
 Second issue, I don't know how to determine how many partitions and exactly their sizes. 
 Can any of you syswizards help me out here?
 I am absolutely trying to avoid manually installing and rebuilding of the server due to so many 3rd party integrations and exe.

 I have a AS5400XM Gateway (old, very old, lol), that is currently password locked. There's no documentation whatsoever. Whether it be online or at work. I use SuperPuTTy and am reverse SSH over an AYSYNC line. I have absolutely no idea as to why I'm not able to break into ROMMON, first off, the unit boots really fast lol, and second there is no text direction in the CLI telling me what break combination to use. 
 ​
 I have one last idea and that is am going to use reverse Telnet over the AYSYNC lines and use the "Special Commands" drop down in SuperPuTTy.
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated!

 If you have used BMC remedy, what are your experience with it? The whole system and layout seems outdated. I do know they used to be a big name years ago?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed some replication delays in a client environment that need some digging into. I am reminding myself of the various switches that make DCDIAG spit out useful things and in the course of doing so, stumbled on documentation about ADREPLSTATUS which looks like a handy-dandy tool for just this kind of thing. 
 But, as Murphy would have it, Microsoft's article about it opens with: 
 As of June 2nd, 2023, the Active Directory Replication Status Tool is no longer available for download. The following article is provided for historical purposes only
 Talk about timing! 
 Has anyone got an alternate source I can grab this..... oh, nevermind.... I see there's a MSFT engineer that has decided to take it on as a personal project. I was about to delete his whole post and score one more point for good ole rubber-duck troubleshooting, but I guess maybe someone might find it ss useful to leave a breadcrumb trail to point here:

 I had on my calendar to do this in August around the 3-month mark but with the uncertainty of my continued presence on reddit I'm going to do it now. 
 I realize I'm still in the "honeymoon" phase but so far I'm loving every aspect of the new role. The hours are flexible, my boss and the team is amazing, I'm learning a ton, and possibly most of all am taking a huge step forward in my career.
 I won't say there haven't been challenges, going from a company of 80 to one of 350k means a lot of bureaucracy. Still waiting for some higher-level access to my laptop but at least I have an Azure VM I can work in with full admin rights. 
 I will also note, probably unsurprisingly, this is the first week I've felt like I can actually contribute to the team. I setup an Azure VM for one of the offshore folks and was able to do a DB restore and push to Azure SQL for some mock data.
 Anyway, yeah that's about it at the moment. Happy to answer questions if I can without doxing myself and all that happy crap.
 Oh, and I will re-iterate from the last time, the outpouring of support from this community was amazing and I truly appreciated all the positive comments and good will. 
 Cheers!

 I have been tasked to write up an “IT Security Overview” to educate a potential new insurer. I have an idea where to start but I could easily make it way to complicated. I am good at that. My idea is to focus it at c-level execs so I can use it for more than one purpose. 
 Some Items I want to include but not limited to
  
 VPN vendor 
  vendor list in general
  MFA status on all services (internal and external)
  Server and Windows Versions
  what outdated software/hardware we have (none)
  Our backup strat (mediums, encryption, testing schedule)
  potentially ACLs on VLANs and VPNs?
  past infections/any data loss (none)
  software update schedule 
 maybe even as far as what firewalls we use. 
  
Does anyone have any other thoughts?
 thanks for listening!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I was managing multiple systems using remote desktop. The desktop I had to use only had one monitor so I had to keep switching between my local desktop and the remote desktop windows. A really annoying issue with this type of setup is using keyboard shortcuts (combinations) in windowed mode for remote desktop is the short cut (i.e. Window+R, Windows+E, etc...)would apply to the local desktop instead of the remote host.
 So I decided to take a look at the advanced settings for RDP and found a setting that I don't remember being there last time I looked (many years ago), and under "Local Resources" > "Apply Windows key combinations" was the solution to this annoying issue. There you can select the option to apply the keyboard shortcuts/combinations to the remote computer, instead of "Only when using the full screen".
 I figured I would share, because I mentioned this to some of my teammates and they didn't know about this setting either.
 Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the Gold award!

 I was looking at the networked devices the other day at work and came across a Chevy Suburban hopping between access points. My two thoughts were, "I really need to change the Wi-Fi password" and "Cars can connect to Wi-Fi now?" I blocked it from the network without a second thought.
 Today I get a ticket in saying, "If you have the time today, my picture frame isn’t on the wifi anymore.
 I was just wondering if you could fix it." I tried throwing in the password to no avail. It just wouldn't take. I reset the device, turned Wi-Fi off, nothing. It finally clicked that the digital picture frame was being listed as a Chevy Suburban in my connected devices! It was a quick switch to unblock it, and I got a nice lesson in Don't do stuff without knowing what you're doing.

The server needs to be retired and I need a way to copy over all 18 TB of data to a new machine. My options are migrating the data to either a new Windows Server or a Synology NAS.
 The old server has only about 1 TB of space left, so P2V tools like disk2vhd wouldn't work (assuming that the VM has to created on the server itself). Veeam is also not an option, since its client doesn't support the old OS. I looked into Synology's "Active Backup for Business", but I've never used it and I'm not sure if it would work.
 What do you think is the best option? I'd really appreciate some advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks, I’m a networking novice and just looking for some help troubleshooting an issue I’m having with the network I maintain/administrate for an event production company. Network is fairly simple with just a handful of VLAN’s, RSTP, DHCP reservations/assignments, and IGMP snooping. 
 Now, onto the setup; switch (Cisco CBS-350 8 port switch in a touring enclosure) has just two VLANs active: VLAN 11 and VLAN 21, with VLAN 1 being the native VLAN as per Cisco standard. One PC on VLAN 11, and one device functioning as a ping responder on VLAN 21. 
 The problem I’m having is the pc on VLAN 11 is able to ping the gateway for VLAN 21, as well as ping the device on VLAN 21 (though the ping only makes it TO the other device, it is not able to be sent back to VLAN 11). Problem only seems to arise when the PC is provided an IP with DCHP, when the PC is set to static IP in the same range I’m unable to ping the gateway of other VLANs. Feel free to ask any questions about the setup that I may not have answered, I’m sure I missed some things. TIA.

Up until now I have used Raritan, but they seem to be completely unable to deliver any devices. I ordered several over a year ago, and they keep pushing back the delivery date, so I am looking for an alternate.
 I would like them to have dual LAN ports for resilience, Dual PSU and connect to the Console port using a standard CAT5 with no adapters. Up to 48 ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[from what i've seen on a bgp intro, when setting up bgp you need a /24 to advertise. We already have 3x /24 public IP blocks on hand but some of those IPs have servers assigned to them already. my question is, do i still need to acquire another /24 block just for bgp use or can we use what we currently have? i guess i'm stuck on the 'advertise' part. my thinking is we're advertising routes a'la ospf, but to the world this time. 
 i apologize if this sounds elementary. i'm working with a contractor overseas so i'm basically the remote hands and in charge of fulfilling requirements, etc. this is my first time working on bgp as you can tell.

 ​
  
Advertise 1st /24 + /23 ISP-A
 Advertise 2nd /24 + /23 ISP-B
  
Would the longest match prefix rule be considered ahead of BGP best path ? In this scenarios ISP-A is Cogent and ISP-B is Lumen. Would advertising the /23 provide failover in the event one side was lost ? One last thought, would the IP range being owned by the end user vs it being leased from a providers range impact this. Say you leased the /23 via Lumen and its part of /16 supernet they advertise via their own AS. This is just a hypothetical although I did once see something similar to this in production and did not have chance to verify if it actually worked as intended.
 ## ISP A - BGP # Inbound: Default Route # Outbound: 30.0.0.0/24 30.0.0.0/23 ## ISP B - BGP ## # Inbound: Default Route # Outbound: 30.0.1.0/24 30.0.0.0/23

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to replace a Netgear GS748Tv4H1 switch that's been in production since 2012. It has worked well (with the exception of a fan replacement a few years ago) but I recently deployed a new batch of workstations that have Intel i225/226 ethernet ports. For some unexplained reason, these computers will show "Network disconnected" unless I manually set the link speed to 10Mb. My troubleshooting process has narrowed it down to some issue with the Netgear switch. Anyway, management has approved a replacement switch, and I was rather hoping to find something that has at least some 2.5Gb ports as the PC's with the i225/226 ports all support that speed. Most of the cables have already been replaced with CAT6 already.
 No fancy networking scenarios here, just a single location of 40 or so mixed devices and the only requirement is LACP for the link aggregates on two Windows servers and a NAS. I will have to replace the WiFi setup as well so the 2.5Gb ports will come in handy for that and POE would be a plus but not a requirement. Having researched for the past few days I've come up with these:
 Juniper EX2300-48MP (16 x 2.5 GbE ports)
 EnGenius ECS2552FP (16 x 2.5 GbE port)
 FS S5800-48MBQ (48 x 2.5 GbE ports)
 People seem to have fairly positive things to say about the Juniper and I'm leaning that way (if I can find it in stock anywhere in Canada). However, I'm just wondering if I'm getting myself into a much more complicated situation that requires support contracts and subscriptions to cloud things and other enterprise-y stuff that I don't need. I abandoned Cisco years ago because the beancounters didn't want to pay for the yearly support contract and I couldn't get any firmware updates after that. I did have an account rep at CDW that I would go to for info but seems they're ghosting me. Am I fine just purchasing the hardware or should I really try to find a different VAR to make sure I'm getting everything I need?

 My reasoning is that commercial VPNs, like NordVPN or others won't work, as they typically have the same IP addresses and can be detected that way.
 The home VPN, however, should in theory not be distinguishable from a "regular" connection.
 Is my assumption correct, or are there other factors that could give out the information that a user is connected through a VPN?

It suggested I also add a memorable number to the end of my password so I decided to just put my current age. For some reason, finally using a password manager felt like a big moment. I remember making that password vividly. I remember exactly where I was, what the furniture looked like, etc.
 Now every day when I enter my master password I realize how much time has passed. I'm coming up on a decade since and every time I get further from that number, my mortality sets in. I can't believe it's been a decade from that point in time. I would not recommend it.
 Which brings me to my main question; how often do you change your master password if at all? Any system for doing so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My head of security wants to explore virtual desktops specifically for contractors, to reduce the need for us to ship expensive laptops to contractors that require access to company systems, which is what we're doing now.
 I haven't explored the VDI space in about 10 years, though I'm familiar with some of the more common solutions like Windows 365 and VMWare. However I haven't worked with any of them or tested any of their offerings recently.
 The basic idea is that these contractors don't need a specific operating system since almost all of our services are web based, and we'd issue them a low(er) cost device like a Chromebook in lieu of a Macbook if they actually needed hardware, or they could access the VM securely via a personal computer.
 Can anyone comment on modern solutions?

 They will not provide us a list of devices and firmwares and instead work with auditors directly. It is kind of crazy.
 But the question I have is all of our 20 or so locations have ancient dumb Cisco ISRs (1900s I believe) - these are all on a MPLS network that go to some kind of Fortinet gateway in their data center.
 Each location has a simple flat VLAN (they refuse to budge on this), so these devices don't really do any routing, the gateway/MPLS would handle all of that.
 Still I am wondering what kind of vulnerablities or risks this might bring.
 We and other orgs are leaving them for a SD-WAN+ZTNA/Zscaler setup, but that won't be for some time.

 Now all of a sudden several users are complaining that SSO does not work, regardless of using Chrome or Edge. It doesn't matter which user logs on to the computer, SSO still will not work, and the user has to type in username and password.
 If we run "gpupdate /force /target:computer" on the problematic computer, SSO works just fine.
 If user restarts computer the same problem occurs again, until "gpupdate /force /target:computer" is run again.
 Configuration is correct,
  
Integrated Windows Authentication is enabled
 
Automatic logon only in Intranet zone is enabled on the Intranet zone settings (user settings GPO)
 
The urls of the websites belong to the intranet zone
 
 Does anyone know what could be causing this intermittent fall out of SSO, or if there are tools that can be used to troubleshoot/log the reason why it's not working, when it stops working? 
 Clients are running Win10 Enterprise 21H2.

As sole IT, it makes it hard on me because it is constantly locking out these two users and I am unlocking them 3 or 4 times a day. One user's attack lasted maybe 3 or 4 days before they quit. The other user's attack has been going on for over a week. It was constant for the first few days but has waned a bit recently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Morning Fellow colleagues,
 After years of battling with the Marketing/Graphic department and their 20 To of data. I installed Photoprism in Docker and showed the Manager the logic of looking for a tool instead of our flat file server windows 2019. the file server have a basic setup, shares, NTFS, and a lot of folders et sub folders. lots of duplicates...
 Ideally:
 selfhosted software
 open source able to connect to the NTFS share to index
 multi users with rights access
 capable of handling videos, pictures, RAW photo format, adobe suite format
 auto tagging, duplicate finding tool, poll system, etc etc
 project management solution or link available with one? ( i know it exist some software special for marketing people where they can push automatically their photoshop (adobe suite) file to a portal and create workflow for approval by the other teams 
 thanks a lot for any idea

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 recently set up a VPS server with Windows Server 2022 featuring 8 CPU Threads, 8GB RAM.
 Using it for trading and stuff, so nothing wild performance wise, this is also reflected in the task manager with around 20-30% CPU usage and 50-60% RAM usage.
 But nonetheless, if accessed via MS RDP, it's almost unusably unresponsive and laggy. Sometimes things don't react to mouse clicks at all but as I said, the apps and stuff run smoothly, it's only the GUI.
 Is this a limitation of RDP, are 3rd party apps more suitable (like AnyDesk, TeamViewer and stuff). Or can RDP be tuned?
 Internet connections are fast (100 and 400 Mbit's for me and server) and the server is not too far away from me.
 Thanks for your help!

 we have a fairly simple configuration for Kuberntes ingress: aws alb receive in 443, forward to 80, and then move traffic to nginx ingress controllers that has services on the 80.
 up until now i never had a problem like this one, snipeit its driving me crazy, the only thing i can get from its ingress is a gateway timeout, and this happens only for its url, all the other applications are working
 log from the ingress controller:
 networking nginx-ingress-nginx-controller-x7j7v controller 2023/06/08 10:50:09 [error] 857#857: *22661 upstream timed out (110: Operation timed out) while connecting to upstream, client: client, server: snipeit.staging.k8s.domain, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "upstream", host: "snipeit.staging.k8s.domain" 
 pod of snipeit doesnt log anything sadly, im using the latest image since i have ARM cluster.
 thats my "proxy" configuration for snipeit, but i tested really almost everything and im starting to thing is a strange combo.
 APP_ALLOW_INSECURE_HOSTS: "true" APP_FORCE_TLS: "true" APP_TRUSTED_PROXIES: "**" APP_LOG_LEVEL: "debug" SECURE_COOKIES: "true" APP_URL: "https://snipeit.staging.k8s.domain" 
 here the ingress configuration:

 also for refernce im using this chart. ; thank you in advance for whatever info you have.

 I'm looking into moving most of our project files into the cloud but after googling a bit it looks like a 50/50 risk where latency will be an issue because of how large they are. I bumped into azure file sync and wondering if anyone here has any success/fail experience with that? Also any testimonies where going to Azure for Autodesk programs would be great. FYI we do use bim collaborative for all new projects but have a lot of legacy projects that mgmt refuse to move over.

 It is the first time I have looked at the switch (SG-500-52) since joining the company and the current manager doesn't know the password. We don't have any records for it. As a result, I am trying to run through the password recovery process.
 I am connected via DB9 into switch console port, DB9 to USB adapter into laptop. The adapter shows up as COM3 on device manager. I have followed the instructions for the baud rate, data bits etc but everytime I connect via Putty I just get a black screen.
 COM3 shows at the top and if I unplug the cable I get an error message. I have tried multiple different baud rates and a couple different drivers for the adapter cable but no luck.
 The only other thing I can think of trying is power cycling the switch whilst connected but I am not allowed to do that during office hours. Any ideas besides this?

 thanks for reading!
 I have an application running on a Windows Server with does not support any authentication at all. Therefore I build an IIS reverse proxy in front of it which is using Windows authentication. Everything worked fine until a new addon was installed to the application. Now, I am always sent back to the Windows authentication pop up when trying to open the addon page and gives me a 401 error although entering the right credentials. For me it looks like there is some kind of username / password coming with the link to the new module which kills my authentication.
 As soon as I change IIS from Windows authentication to Anonymous authentication it works.
 Here are the IIS logs (anonymized)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So what I'm looking for is something that emulates the functionality of say MDT or FOG Project but that's entirely mobile, can be run from bootable media/local storage and doesn't require a server-side application that client devices have to interface with (preferably, the image files can be stored anywhere and then copied to storage media that is connected to the devices that require imaging).
 This would be used exclusively for imaging devices with Windows 10/11 Pro and customising the images to include the usual suite of client/environment specific additions: drivers, applications, Windows configuration, etc.
 The closest solution I can think of is NTLite but this product goes WAY back and I have no idea whether it's at all relevant, well-supported, still works with Windows 11 and there are security concerns with tools like these given most of them are closed-source. Also, from what I can tell it's exclusively an image-editing solution, so the imaging part of the process still has to be done manually via making bootable USB drives with Rufus for example. I don't believe there are any similar solutions out there that can for example, image devices on the same network from a image repository stored on local storage?
 We have a number of clients with no on-prem server hardware that have fairly unique, extensively-customised OS images with a plethora of industry-specific software on top of that, and they are an absolute time-sink to reimage whenever one of their PCs/laptops is having issues and/or they purchase new hardware.

 This is a real long shot, I'm at the end of all my support options! Banging my head against the wall because I am clearly missing something obvious.
 I have two ASAv's in different locations, both with the same split tunneling setup. We have a internet based service that we use OKTA for Authentication and recently implemented a CA policy to restrict out bound networks from accessing.
 What we have discovered is that Location A seems to show OKTA our DC Public IP, Location B it see's their personal public IP.
 If you have a corporate IP you are routed internally to an on-prem appliance to authenticate. This doesn't happen in the other location, you are simply blocked.
 If my route of traffic is to an external internet based application surely OKTA wouldn't see my corporate DC IP. So how on earth does it manage to?!
 Gosh please help, tried explaining this to OKTA and got nowhere,

 Currently we have unifi in the uk, but across the rest of our sites in europe we are using meraki.
 In one of our uk sites we have 30 unifi access points and we plan to add another 10, however we would like to move to meraki eventually.
 If i put 10 meraki ap's into the uk site and configure them the same as the unifi (ssid's, vlans etc) will i have performance issues?
 we don't have the budget to do a full lift and shift, so it would have to be staged if this will work.

 A few observations is that there is a huge disparity between bottom range vendors and top range vendors in terms of price, and that there is a corresponding disparity in terms of tool functionality and Trust-center maturity. Top tier vendors offer some cool functions, but the increase in price was hardly worth it.

 I am looking for free alternatives to Anydesk and Chrome remote desktop. Teamviewer says I should buy a license because I use it often. Anydesk is pretty robust but there is a noticeable lag, which I don't see on Chrome remote desktop. Unfortunately, one of my computers is connected to an new network where I can connect only through proxy. Chrome remote desktop doesn't have an option for proxy manipulation and changing it through the whole system didn't work either. 
 I tried NoMachine but I kept getting problems with the proxy. I gave up since I saw a lot of negative reviews about being slow.

 Long story short, I've received a SNMP-related task and don't really know how to conclude it. I don't have a networking background, I'm mostly a programmer. I'm running Oracle Linux, for info. 
 I need to implement SNMP v3 communication between the user and an agent, which I was able to do and is working as expected. I would like to add an extra layer of security using certificates, and this is the part that I am having issues with. I can generate and sign the certificates just fine, but what should be the content of snmpd.conf? It seems that all I try, the SNMP commands work either with or without the certificates, and I'm not able to find a conclusive example. I feel I'm missing something, any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Odd question but googling has left me with no answers. 
 We currently have O365 and force MFA on every account. Users have downloaded the Microsoft Authenticator app and have added name@companydomain.com to it. 
 Works just fine for logging into O365
 We are about to roll out MFA to the new payroll system but in testing when adding the account via QR code (name@companydomain.com is the login) a second account in the Authenticator is not created and now the onetime passcode that cycles for that account works in both O365 AND the payroll system. 
 How and why?
 If I force a re-registration on O365 it breaks the payroll MFA
 If the user deletes the account from the Authenticator and adds it back it breaks the payroll MFA.
 I would think the onetime code for O365 and payroll system would be different unless they are somehow communicating. 
 Side note: there’s ZERO integration between the two systems. One is managed and maintained by HR and the other is IT.

Long story short the 9300 wasn't about to find its way out of the network the core switch at the site could ping the 9300. They were directly connected via fiber. The 9300 didn't work until I added a static route to the core switch. "ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 "core ip" ". My qestuon is why I do i need to add the default route when I already programmed a default gateway on the 9300. The 3750 has no issues with understand the exit point but 9300 needs that static route when it's only a layer 2 device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I already know the answer to this question. I was having a discussion about design with one of my bosses and I think we are in a disagreement about security best practices and practicality of implementing this type of design. 
 I think its normal to have your data VLAN, voice VLAN, WiFi/Guest VLANs, IOT VLAN, server VLAN, and perhaps others as needed. I also think its normal for a lot, if not all, of this traffic to hairpin to the local firewall. This may add a very slight amount of latency, but its worth it because of the added security letting the firewall inspect, monitor, and log traffic. 
 I think we have fundamental disagreements about network designs. I think hed prefer everything to be as flat as possible, but that is extremely messy. And makes troubleshooting difficult sometimes. As well as implementing changes on the fly. If data and phones are on the same subnet, you can run into QoS issues if you just start throwing on SSL inspection. 
 Anyways, my point is this type of design should not be considered "over-engineered" for even a small to medium sized business. MAYBE a mom/pop shop with 10 employees, a DC, a file server, and a couple printers its overkill. But, otherwise as you start to grow you NEED to take these things into a consideration otherwise it becomes a mess.

I'm all for adding a little spice to the machines but you would have thought being such an expensive device ($3-5k AUD EACH) that they'd at least clean them before sending them out.
 Just wondering whether this is us (Sydney, Australia) or whether we've been feeding down from a bad batch of machines for the last 6mo. We're about to start direct-to-user'ing them with Autopilot and it doesn't exactly make it feel like a great experience. Never had this issue with any other vendor.
 EDIT: pictures of one we received this morning - you'll note the device hasn't been taken out of the plastic wrapper yet

 The problem was, the address-object on the translated packet was what is on the outside interface, including the subnet mask of a /28!! Which royally messed everything up! I'm guessing that it was proxy-arping out for all the addresses in that range/subnet and it ended up killing our current live outbound firewalls!
 What I SHOULD have done is have another address-object that was the same address but on a /32, is that right? That's what I have now, but holy fuck am I scared to switch it back on! Even when going through a change!
 I noticed you can set it to translate to the interface address, interface and IP Address as well? Would this do the same as above when I mentioned about what I should've done instead?
 The PA NAT is definitely a different concept when coming from an ASA and Firepower world! And I lost a lot of confidence and have been pretty hard on myself ever since that happened yesterday and not seeing that!
 Would I be alright doing either of the 2 revised ways mentioned?
 The reason why I switched this particular NAT rule on was that its meant to be a catch all for PAT to the interface address, we have a large routed range that is natted to specific public IP's and they're currently live on the ASA's, so I can't enable those specific ones on the PA's yet, so I needed a way to get the outside interface working to test a few VM's in one of the lower end environments

 The issue is that I am getting this error, % Unrecognized command

 However, this is a recognized command on the Cisco Vios or the switch but not the router image.
 Is this an issue with Cisco vios image (vios-adventerprisek9-m.spa.159-3)?
 Is there another Cisco router image that is recommended to enable ssh?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On an existing Cisco BGP configuration I want to add a new BGP peer as backup and remove an old one:
 router bgp 54321 bgp router-id 9.9.9.9 neighbor 50.50.50.50 remote-as 7777 neighbor 50.50.50.50 description peer1 neighbor 68.68.68.68 remote-as 7777 neighbor 68.68.68.68 description peer2 neighbor 68.68.68.68 ebgp-multihop 255 ! address-family ipv4 network 9.9.9.0 neighbor 50.50.50.50 activate neighbor 50.50.50.50 weight 300 neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out neighbor 68.68.68.68 activate neighbor 68.68.68.68 weight 100 neighbor 68.68.68.68 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 68.68.68.68 prefix-list deny-all out exit-address-family ! ip prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK seq 5 permit 9.9.9.0/24 ! ip prefix-list default-route seq 5 permit 0.0.0.0/0 ! ip prefix-list deny-all seq 5 deny 0.0.0.0/0 
 Removing 68.68.68.68 and adding 12.12.12.12 it would look something like this:
 router bgp 54321 bgp router-id 9.9.9.9 neighbor 50.50.50.50 remote-as 7777 neighbor 50.50.50.50 description peer1 neighbor 12.12.12.12 remote-as 7777 neighbor 12.12.12.12 description peer2 ! address-family ipv4 network 9.9.9.0 neighbor 50.50.50.50 activate neighbor 50.50.50.50 weight 300 neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out neighbor 12.12.12.12 activate neighbor 12.12.12.12 weight 200 neighbor 12.12.12.12 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 12.12.12.12 prefix-list deny-all out exit-address-family 
 Questions: 
 Why does only the primary peer has "prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out" is this a misconfiguration on the original setup that missed the advertised block on the secondary peer?
 Same question for "prefix-list deny-all out" on the backup peer
 Shouldn't both neighbors have the same config except for weight (300 for primary)?
 EDIT Forgot to add, the new peer is directly connected and shouldn't need multihop so I removed that line

With Unifi switches and AP's. We used to have old cisco switches with a pix firewall.
 Another direction I am being pushed toward is using a Cisco ASA with "Cisco Business" switches.
 For unifi I am concerned about the ability to properly segment the network especially if Layer 3 functionality is required.
 We will need separation for a few things.
  
Keycard entry/door controller. This will only want internet when updates are necessary.
 Security camera VLAN for cameras and DVR.
 VLAN for Employee PCs Laptops Phones.
 Guest VLAN for Guest Wifi
 Possibly an IOT VLAN? (if not placed on the other guest network.) for the Thermostats, Ring Devices Etc.
  
Will Ubiquity/Unifi be able to handle this and keep it secure? Anything I should be concerned about or aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Deep (quick?) question! I’m trying to size servers to host a network monitoring solution and I need to « guestimate » how many sessions per second (on average) you can see going through a 10GBit/s (RX/TX = both direction between two IP addresses, whatever the protocols over that) in an ISP network, a small Data Center network and the network of a Large Enterprise. I know it heavily depends on how many equipments are behind those, but… 🤷🏻‍♂️ - I’m starving for real life data ;-)
 And I know every network is different, but that would help me a lot if you could quote average and peak usages for those kind of networks you might have seen on 10G or even a 25G or 40G network (both North-South and East-West). 
 I looked at research papers, but… I just couldn’t find anything useful. Sometimes I find data on flows per second… but that’s not the same thing and extrapolating numbers isn’t really easy. 
 Can someone (or several someone) help me out on this one or point me to the right direction/ressource?

Background: Reddit is starting to charge for their API, which means that open-source reddit clients will likely cease to function next month.
 In response, hundreds of subreddits are going dark to remind Reddit that their website is only as valuable as their user's content. And the users want to be able to use open-source apps.
 Can /r/sysadmin join this protest by going dark for 48 hours, starting on June 12th?
 Edit While this subreddit is dark, users can still share and read about critical outages on /c/sysadmin on lemmy as a backup/alternative in the fediverse.

 This forces powershell to use TLS 1.2 and everything works fine again.
 Just thought I'd share in case your sendgrid emails aren't working - that's likely the culprit!

 We are in a such situation that Aruba TAC basically made everything worse so far.
 We have a customer case that made bracnch users to can't take IP from DC.
 Long story short, I saw there is L2 tunnels between branch and DC clusters. Since the team that commissioned this have no idea about loops, cluster *tunnels* had no redundancy, and one branch cluster member at a time can't connect to DC.
 TAC made tunnel redundancy with full mesh tunnels. No VRRP used anywhere. The problem is since SSID VLAN connected to same L2 domain, network has now big problem, loop.
 I'm looking for solution, since branch load balancing has no issues so far, and SSID not bridge on branch, we need solution for DC side.
 What do you think about ,we should use Aruba tunnel groups, Branch primary tunnels goes to physical address of first DC cluste member and secondary goes to second cluster member.
 Or
 We just use VRRP for branch destination and DC source. I saw a Airheads post about VRRP standby never use this tunnel unless VRRP active realy goes down. So far no loops.
 Any help would be appreciated

 ​
 These devices are constantly on the network sending out information to an application. At one of the facilities, the device stopped sending info. So of course we get called. We cannot ping it, can't access the web interface, nothing. The screen on the device itself is still showing good info, it's just not sending it over the network anymore. We get the person on-site to reboot it and it came back up.

 Well then it started happening more and more. This facility is a LONG way from the central office and this now malfunctioning device is quite important. We sent someone on site with a fluke to certify the runs…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm in the middle of a migration to 2 pairs of 3220's, one pair for outbound and another for hosted.
 I've created the necessary layer 7 profiles, my question is, what and where would be the best places to apply them?
 At the moment, I'm thinking about putting only the URL based ones on outbound "any" rules and leaving the Anti Virus, Spyware and Vulnerability profiles off since logically they're only really meant for inbound attacks? I guess you could make a case for potential filed that are downloaded and thus the Anti Virus profile would be useful then. Initially I did think about apply all 4 mentioned above there to "any" rules and have the same 3 applied to any rules coming in on the hosted firewalls.
 What are generally, the best ways to do it in everyone's opinion?
 Thanks

 We're not looking to monitor more than that node so we're essentially looking for a service that is happy to provide service for a single node.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on vendors we could take a look at?

 There are no "unused" domains that are available, all domains in question have had previous owners. Can this affect deliverability? What if the previous domain owner used it to broadcast spam?
 ​
 I myself don't send any unsolicited (or even solicited) marketing emails. We basically only respond to customer inquiries within minutes or days at latest. In other words, almost none of our outgoing mail is not a response to an earlier, incoming mail from the corresponding sender.
 However, since it's a support email address, delivery is very very important so we don't want to risk hitting a spam folder with customers then complaining that they haven't received a response yet

 Have got the keys saved in a secure location, but having checked both in the tenant Azure and the actual users My Devices section, I can't see the key in there, although this has all been within the last 5 mins to be fair.
 The real question I suppose; does the client now require an Intune license in order for 365 to store Bitlocker keys?

 I have a router set up t get time from and upstream router ad they are sync'd up at a Stratum 2. 
 I am trying to get all my servers below my router to point to my router as their time source. Would I need to have the "ntp master" command in my router so the servers will be able to get the time from my router?
 ​
 This is a Cisco shop with Windows 2019 servers
 I have the ntp keys and the servers configured on my router as well as the ntp source which is my loopback0 interface. and when I run a show ntp status and associations I see that we are sync'd with the servers. I just need the Windows servers to get their time from my router.

 I´m concerned by the use of ChatGPT in my organizations. We have been discussing blocking ChatGPT on our network to prevent users from feeding the Chatbot with sensitive company information. 
 I´m more for not blocking the website and educate our colleagues instead. We can´t prevent them for not accessing the website at home and feed the Chatbot with information. 
 ​
 What are your thoughts on this?

 I have experience setting DHCP servers before but have never done anything like this before so any resources and guidance or alternative solutions would be helpful 
 I was planning to use ISCSI following directions in the below video but in the comments it said that only 1 client can boot at a time 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_elwqBKIlLI
 The link below says that using ISCSI it can diskless boot multiple client but i cant find any resources or guides on this
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/iscsi/iscsi-target-server
 The goal is to have the clients boot up with a fresh preconfigd os with preinstalled applications every restart 
 Im currently looking at ccboot or dds+ but of course ill look elsewhere first since i need to pay for it
 The server is a HP proliant dl380p gen8 The PCs is a mix of models from HP & DELL 
 Sorry if my grammar is bad english is not my first language

 I was wondering who of you got some good software approval requests processes? Maybe ITIL compliant, maybe not?
 I find the process hard, as there are many factors, costs/cybersecurity/the technical pull for maintenance etc. 
 We do have a good process for big systems, such as CRM etc. but for the smaller ones, time and attendance, task management, plug-ins etc. are a bit complex to handle and results in long approval times for the users, and a lot of no's.
 I was thinking about a software technology board, and to try to shift as much decision power left in the process so the first evaluator can make 90% of the decisions, but I would appreciate if any of you want to share your experiences?
 We are a global company with 800 users.

 Anyway, these are the pages I mainly got my information from:
 https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/MLNXOFEDv471001/OVS+Offload+Using+ASAP2+Direct
 https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/l/architecture-guide-ready-architecture-for-red-hat-openstack-platform-version-16-1-flex-2/sr-iov-ovs-hardware-offload-with-vf-lag
 ​
 My understanding is: VF LAG means two physical ports / physical functions on a card are getting bonded. And then virtual functions of that bonded interface are passed through to VMs.
 And using SR-IOV, the kernel offloads that stuff to the NIC.
 Is my understanding correct?

 I was thinking this is was just in gaming, a model where you release a broken piece of software that is somewhat usable only after 6 months of updates but you get your money because people are... people... but I start seeing it in a lot of software nowadays that gets a major update that breaks it for months (looking at you HP and DELL).
 From broken video (dear intel choke on broken always-on dynamic contrast) and audio drivers (waves choke on that out-of-a-barrel-echo) on 1000$ laptops to BIOS settings that don't work properly ??? And crashes in software that was very reliable years ago from big companies like Cisco and Adobe.

I've gotten plenty of (targeted) spam emails and calls, including to my personal cell (last one was from ADP... really? really?). I'm sure y'all get them too. Some of them even say "I got your details from LinkedIn" but they're using details that LinkedIn never had. They're likely getting your info from one of the big B2B services out there. So I went and compiled a quick list of 11 of the largest B2B databases, with the links to their opt-out/delete pages. 
 This is especially useful if you're in CA, but should at least work if you're in the US or EU. All of them will require your (business) email and some other details to process the request, and some are more solid than others. It's also a good idea (if possible) to see what they have on you before requesting the delete -- that's how I found one of them that had my personal cell # attached.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was tasked with building out a new HQ site and was curious as to what folks on here would choose for hardware options if they had the opportunity to greenfield something. I have been a staunch supporter of Arista in the datacenter but the 720 series just don't seem to make sense from a price to performance perspective (7 - 10k for a 24port POE switch...) . I really like Juniper's EX switches and the mist APs have been solid when I have deployed them in the past. However I am already deploying Fortinet / FortiAPs at other locations. I ideally wanted to avoid Cisco and have no experience with Aruba. I was thinking a mix of FortiGate FW \ AP's and Juniper Switches (POE and Access) would probably work but would be curious to hear what other folks would opt for and why. Lets say for this exercise the site is 25k sqft over 4 floors with a comms room on each with structured caballing between comms rooms and to the floor ports. Cable runs for the AP's are already done. The Site will host about 100 - 150 users at peak. All you have to do is choose the hardware configure \ install and manage it. Oh I suppose for external connectivity you could have dual DIA at the site with SD-WAN or P2P circuits to local DC locations if that makes any difference. 
 ​
  
Switches - Juniper EX (POE)
 Firewall - FortiGate 100 or 200f HA
 
Wireless (APs and Controller if required) - FAP-231G (FortiGate as the controller)

 We're using PKI/ NDES and Intune/ SCEP. This is set up and user/ machine certificates are flowing to the clients just fine. The user authentication is working fine as well. The issue I'm seeing is machine authentication failing on the login screen. Our NAC (ClearPass) is stating the object cannot be found in the identity store (local AD), which makes sense.
 Is this configuration possible? What would need to be adjusted to make this work?

I've tried every combo of BIOS settings for them (disabling secure boot, etc..). Formatted both in NTFS and ExFat
 Try to boot using Hiren Boot CD? It loads the first frame, but you can't move or select anything
 Try to boot using Windows Media Created USBs, freezes on the first screen
 Try to boot using Windows PE to build a new image, it gets stuck at wpeinit (Initializing). Can't go any further.
 I did confirm it can boot to other situations like a Ubuntu .iso. So I don't think it's the USB file system.
 The laptops in particular are Surfaces 4 and 5 and probably other models. Does anyone have a good idea of what's going on here? I can't figure it out from my coworkers, nor the internet.

All of them were outside salespeople, using their mobile phones with Outlook. So, they saw the name and not the email address so they responded. Then, and this is the new one for me,they received a text message asking them to call him. Their outbound email signature includes their cellphone number, but two of the salespeople who got the text message had not replied to the email.
 They all quickly figured out it was not the owner, so nothing bad happened. What bothers me, other than the contact list leak, is the text messages. A bot campaign sending out phishing emails is not unusual. But, sending text messages is a new one.

I'm running into a weird issue for just my machine so far, where it will send my computer certificate but not user. The deployed GPO is basically the same as wireless which works fine and is the same as other machines/users that also work fine, on the same switch (9300L) to the same ISE nodes (2.7) and machines are running Windows 10 22H2. 
 Windows event logs don't show any errors, but I can confirm with a pcap on the workstation that only the machine cert ever leaves it.
 I cannot for the life of me figure out why I can't get it to send my user cert only over wired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have you tried turning it off and on?" is a common thing IT guys get made fun of for saying, but I mean we kind of deserve it. If it works, use it! I think it's funny that other professions ALSO turn it off and back on, they just don't want to call it that. Like once my mechanic told me to fix an issue with my car we needed to unplug the battery for an hour and then hook it back up. I said "So ... turn it off and turn it back on?" and he was like "no, no, not like a computer" and I just said "suuuure."
 Well this weekend I learned a new one. Saturday evening my heart started racing for no reason. I put on my wife's FitBit and my heart rate was 124, well over the 80 it should have been. I ended up in the ER, and told me my heart was in AFib. Normally when you heart beats, the top part of your heart beats first, then the bottom part beats. In AFib the top part of your heart doesn't beat, it just kind of flutters. For me this meant the bottom part was beating much faster to try and compenstate. 
 I had to have a procedure, and the doctor described it as "We are going to put a tube down your throat to get a better view of your heart, then we are going to give you a drug that will stop your heart for a moment, then we will shock your heart to get it started again, and it should start beating normally." I said "So... turn it off and turn it back on?" He didn't know what to say so I said "It's ok, I am very familar with this process." 
 So there you have it fellow nerds. There is nothing that can't be fixed without turning it off and turning it back on.
 (FYI, the procedure went well and my heart is back to normal. Also I ordered a smart watch that can detect AFib.)

 I have Barracuda Firewalls in Azure VMs and today everything behind that firewall just failed.
 After hours spent on the phone with support. it turns out there was geo update that labeled a certain ip address as coming from Hong Kong. this was an incorrect update. And if you are like my business and block all traffic from certain regions (in this case Hong Kong) then good luck getting in. for the longest time we were scratching our heads as our firewalls appeared functional and fine yet the only way we could communicate with them was through the azure serial console.
 ​
 Solution
 We created an outside VM in our azure environment that we could run the barracuda admin console on and thus make the corrections and exempt the IP address.
 ​
 Barracuda literally learned about this as we called. so, if you call you may have a smaller wait time than I did. thought I'd share the knowledge in case anyone needed it.

 ifSpeed.539 = 20000000 - This is the value that is the upload speed of interface pt-1/0/0 and I Was able to get the OID (1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5.539) and pull it into our Zabbix 6 instance and its monitoring it just fine. 
 But I am HARD stuck at finding the MIB / OID corresponding to the value 79999 so I can also track the Download speed. I can not seem to find it anywhere. If I run an SNMP walk for that value it turns up nothing. I feel like im missing something and im now at bash head against wall territory so if I could get ANY advice that would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow, Datadog's sales are getting aggressive. Anyone else experiencing this?
 I keep getting calls from Datadog on my personal phone. They must have scraped it from the web. It's pretty obvious I'm being targeted due to my title. Nobody else at my company is getting these calls. I never requested any info from them either.
 I've already told them we use a different stack and aren't interested in changing. Datadog is WAY too expensive for us already and I've read enough billing issues and "getting bit by the dog" posts on this subreddit dealing with DD on top of that.
 I mentioned that there is one monitoring element I haven't found solution for (big mistake). I work in the robotics industry so I threw him a question about if they had solutions for ROS monitoring. He said no. Ok so I tell him I'm not interested and hang up.
 Two weeks later I get an email from the DD sales guy saying he discussed my needs with a developer and wanted to see if i was interested in what they came up with. They basically began trying to sell me on software that was hacked together after 2 weeks and wasn't even listed on their website. I'm good. No thanks.
 Months. no more calls. Ah peace.
 Today. The cycle has started again. Maybe a new guy. Idk. Told him I'm not interested. This time I keep my mouth shut about ROS.They obviously still don't offer it publically. He sent me a calendar invite anyway. He said if you can't make it or if you're not interested, just cancel. Fair enough.
 Ok, so I just cancelled that meeting. Now I'm getting emails about me cancelling and trying to reschedule. 
 I don't get it. I don't want your software. I already said no on the phone and email multiple times and cancelled your meetings. I have an option to reschedule too but, I didn't. Take a hint.
 Probably going to block them if this doesn't stop soon. I've never had to do this before in my career with any vendor.

I get along well enough with my manager and the sr admin on site. The Sr admin likes me but is already pushing for me to get brought on full time. I've gotten good feedback from them so I know that I'm doing something right.
 It doesn't feel right that the sr admin is already pushing for me to go full time after only a week. I don't even know what would come of this, the manager seems a little resistant to this but I imagine that's because it's only been a week. I can't tell if anything is wrong or not but I could use some sage advice. I think if I got it, it'd be a good opportunity for me to be a jr. I came from a background of Helpdesk / Desktop support with sysadmin duties mixed in so I have a lot of experience with what they do and I could use more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that the solution is to get the framework updated for these ancient internally hosted sites and portals for them to be free of IE dependency. However, the answer is always "there's no budget for upgrades. Please continue to support". Access is becoming increasingly unreliable no matter how many IE Mode settings are tweaked on my end or the vendors end.
 External vendors are being given my contact information by procurement and purchasing departments and being told to contact me and I will fix it. I'm getting 2-3 requests a day from different people, knocking down my door screaming about how this needs to be fixed right this minute.
 I am not an applications person, the one applications manager we had left years ago. I am not sure how to approach this from a technical or professional perspective. I cant wave a magic wand and make incompatible technology suddenly work, but I also can't simply throw my hands up and say "Sorry, not my problem".

I wasn't aware that you could run a personal and work account side by side using the same email but the issue we're running into is when they're logged into the browser on their work account and attempt to open a SharePoint document in the desktop app it prompts for authentication so they'll type their email address and then get prompted to choose between the work or personal account. Once they select work, the account is signed in but the document is blank and eventually gives an error saying the document cannot be opened. 
 ​
 I've verified it's any document on SharePoint opened in desktop app, even if downloaded and then opened locally. We've removed the personal account from her machine (this particular user's is not domain joined unlike most), changed the primary alias on the personal account to a bogus email in hopes it wouldn't recognize it and removed the company email, turned off "auto sign in to microsoft apps" to revert them back to local account, reinstalled office, signed out of M365 on both accounts on browser and cleared cookies, tried various browsers and banged our heads against the wall for a long time. Has anyone ran into this issue? Does anyone know how to get out of it? Closing the personal account apparently can be done, it just requires contacting MS support which if I have to I will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks,
 After about a year of asking for our manager and dept head to give us an actual policy of what on-call entails and not just "work with the team to make sure any off-hours issues are resolved", we finally have it in writing, and it sucks. 
 We are expected to respond to all issues that come in 24 hours a day during the 7-day stretch we are on call. All issues have to be answered within the 0-2 hour SLA, including those reported by slack, jira ticket, email, and phone call. This is in addition to our normal 8 hour work day.
 The volume of calls generally isnt that bad (2-3 per day), but its the SLA bit thats chapping my rear a bit. To meet this expectation I'd have to set an alarm on my phone to wake up and check slack and Jira every 90 minutes or so. And on top of that we are to answer any helpdesk calls that come in regardless of time. 
 Aside from the question of legality in my state (I'm asking a friend who is a lawyer about that), I wanted to get the opinion of folks on here. Is this even remotely normal/acceptable?

 I have a peculiar situation at work where we once used exchange server 2003 back in 2009. And our primary DC was on windows server 2008. 
 Nowadays, we have our domain controler synchronized with azure every half an hour and we want to upgrade it from 2008 to 2019.
 So both our dc and azure are aware of the old 2003 exchange(now offline). Since our mails are on microsoft exchange atm, if we do the upgrade im afraid that something might go wrong since i dont know if both of them are aware 2003 is out of service.
 Is there any way to know for sure? Thnx

 First week I started I had an auditor call me since an IT-audit was due. Never heard of it, had to power through.
 The old IT guy left 6 months before I started. Had to train myself and get familiar with the infrastructure (bunch of old 2008 R2 servers). Started migrating our on-prem into a data center since the CEO wanted no business of having our own servers anymore.
 CEO called me after-hours on my private cellphone, had to take an old employees phone and use his number so people from work could call me. They never thought about giving me a work phone.
 At least I learned a lot and am free of stress. Have to sit here for the next 3 months though (termination period of 3 months).

 The requirement is to build a SQL environment using Windows Server Failover Clustering. This will be a two node SQL cluster (active/passive) running on across two virtual machines.
 My question is what licensing will be required. The company has SA, so from what I've read only the active node needs to be licensed. Just looking for some guidance on what I need to get the company to pay for. Would SQL Standard edition, and licensing for the cores on the virtual machine for the active node?
 Sorry for the simplistic questions, I'm new to SQL and I find microsoft licensing very confusing.

 Occasionally, we get issues that crop up. Sometimes it’s a SPF issue, sometimes a port issue on a device. Rarely is the issue a cable.

 I know Fluke testers are the industry standard. But they have them ranging from a lot of money up to a ton of money. I don’t know what I need. 
 Can someone lay out the options and benefits/shortcomings of what I need for occasional troubleshooting? I don’t see this as on par with needs of an installer who has to certify multiple runs at once with cable serial number printouts. But testing here and there is more likely the use case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 It has recently occurred to me that part of job of IT and sysadmin is gaslighting users. Not intentionally. However over the years I have found that users will generally tell you a problem only for you to try it and it works. There have also been times where you make a change on the network, something you think won't be affected is affected and you undo that change. Instead of explaining the process of what you did (because either the user wont care or understand) you say, it's fixed. Or there have been instances when you kind of made a stupid mistake and instead of admit your mistake, you quietly undo the thing and the user is puzzled as to why it started working again. 
 I have been in IT for about 15 years in numerous roles and still carry a passion for it. I will passionately explain things to people if they will listen. For some reason though, I have found due to the environment and nature of IT, people either don't take interest or done care so you are sometimes left to look like you just performed magic and it is now working. 
 I am just wondering if anyone else feels the same.

 I'm no longer mad at Cisco I'm more philosophical about it. I can't be mad at a lamprey for being a lamprey, it's just in their nature to survive by providing very little and then continuing to take and take and take, forever. Cisco, sadly, is running hell's bell's to turn into that kind of company, right after Microsoft. Unlike Microsoft, though, Cisco is NOT a monopoly. Monopolies like Microsoft are government regulated and slapped down when they get too greedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The company I work for has an Azure only environment. 
 We disable a user when an employee leaves the company (we never delete it), removing the license. 
 What we want is that an email goes out saying that the employee has left the company if someone tries to send the former employee an email. 
 I am trying to set up a catchall mail that sends that autoreply following these instructions (almost)
 https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30462.office365-catch-all-mailbox.aspx?fbclid=IwAR0DOO6wZRZvJaLRa5SHaaINP8a4BAzuDJ8AiGDlqXuarLVIFY9jrDpLrcs 
 I set up a distribution group (not dynamic) with an email address [disabledusers@contoso.com](mailto:disabledusers@contoso.com) , I also set up an shared mailbox employeehasleft[@contoso.com](mailto:userhasleft@contoso.com) with the OOO autoreply. 
 I set a task in our offboarding lifecycle workflow to add the user to the disableduser group. 
 I changed the accepted domain (in exchange - mailflow) to InternalRelay 
 I set up a mailflow rule 
 "Apply this rule if
 Is sent to a member of group 'disabledusers@contoso.com'
 Do the following
 Redirect the message to 'employeehasleft@contoso.com'" 
 But this thing is not working. 
 Is there no simple way to do this? I feel like I'm using "old" on prem solutions for my Azure only environment. 
 Thanks so much for your help guys

 "What to do when updates are found... Download and install updates."
 and for update settings I have tested multiple different settings and none of the have worked, originally I had it set on Automatic updates, but they wouldn't update. Then I set it for a specific time daily, I set it for 7PM last night on my test computer. Come in this morning and see it says it checked for updates last night at 7PM but the last time it updated was 3PM yesterday. So why will it not update automatically?

 3 days leave, came back and was off sick with gastric flu for 5 days.
 Found out yesterday that they filled the vacancy without telling me it had gone live or asking if I wanted to apply

 I've recently started moving all our users with admin rights to the Protected Users AD group.
 We've had no major fallout from this after an extensive testing period but one issue remains that I haven't been able to find anything about anywhere.
 We use a couple of Windows Server systems as print servers. We would like to manage them (print queues, permissions etc.) remotely using printmanagement.msc run from an elevated mmc.exe. When connecting to one of our print servers (Windows Server 2019 systems), the account is immediately locked out.
 I can see no unusual events when this happens (4769 [requesting kerberos service ticket], 304 [granting kerberos service ticket to a "Protected Users" member] and ultimately 4740 [account locked out]) and can't think of a reason why this would happen.
 Have any of you seen this before? I'd be grateful for any imput!

 ​
 I have a 3750 connected to a 9300 and it's capping out at ~300mbps, with inconsistent speeds overall on iPerf.
 ​
 There are not policies on either switch. Both endpoint ports are on the same vlan and communication works fine, just the bandwidth is poor.
 ​
 I have updated both the 9300 and 3750 to the latest ios yet this hasn't fixed it.
 ​
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas what it could be? (I cannot get rid of the 9300 at the moment)

 What I also noticed that if a Service Instance is inside a port-channel or a bundle-ethernet they suddenly can be monitored, is this correct?
 So, correct me if I'm wrong, if I REALLY wanted to monitor those service instances I can configure a port-channel with only 1 physical interface and I could get it working?
 FYI all of this is on a few ASR920 Cisco routers.
 How dumb is this? Is there a better way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've got a real head-scratcher here. We have a user called Tim (not his real name) who's calendar seems to be causing some major problems for other user's Outlooks clients. When the other users have Tim's calendar added to their list of shared calendars, their Outlook grinds to a halt and uses 40% of the CPU and causes total system instability. Every 5 seconds or so, it says "updating Tim's calendar" in the bottom right before disappearing again. This continues constantly as it was affecting one user for over a week until they reported it.
 The only way to fix this is to remove Tim's calendar from their Outlook completely - simply unchecking the box to display it doesn't work.
 The weird part is not everybody who has Tim's calendar has this issue, it seems to be 3 users out of about 10 who need access to his calendar. But all users who have this issue have Tim's calendar in their Outlook, so I'm fairly certain the issue is actually to do with Tim's calendar rather than the user's outlook clients..
 So far I have tried; • Quick and full repairs of Office on both the user's and Tim's devices • New Outlook profiles for both Tim and affected users • Removing all offline and cached items from Tim's Outlook calendar • Checking Tim's calendar for any recurring meeting going for excessive lengths of time
 I'm honestly a bit lost as to what to try next so any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on some networking assignments lately that could really benefit from the ability to detect what IP settings a particular switch is using. We have one netool.io at work, but it's still in the grasp of another coworker. I'm wondering if I can potentially get the same performance from various Linux/Windows applications as I could from a netool.io. 
 Basically, I would just like to be able to plug into a switch cold and figure out what net address/subnet/vlans/etc. are currently configured. nmap and netstat are useful, but I haven't been able to reliably log into a switch in a timely manner yet. 
 I'll be heading back to Google shortly, but are there any online sources that explain specifically what netool.io and PockEthernet do? As I previously stated, it'd be really nice if I could just equip my laptop (or, ideally, my Samsung phone) with the tools necessary to perform the same function. 
 Any other ideas/reading/etc. for performing these sorts of tasks are also appreciated. 
 Thanks!

 A storage pool was created using these disks to create one 30TB drive for SQL data files. (There is a separate pool for SQL log files)
 Now, the column size for the data file storage pool was created as 3.

 there's a problem in our company with Microsoft Teams, especially with the chat feature.
 I think that Teams is a wonderful tool to use and can help us to boost our productivity at work. Unfortunately, some stupid colleagues use it to chat to each other, also creating groups. Now that the HR noticed it, they want me, as the IT admin, to disable the chat for everyone.
 I think that this approach is not the right one, firstly because there are a lot of people using the chat in the right manner, and secondly because a tool like Teams doesn't make sense without a chat, for me.
 Now the question. Is there the possibility to restrict in some way the ability to create groups for some people or to talk to each other? I really can't disable the chat for everyone, otherwise our dinosaurs colleague will continue to use the email as the tool to chat, send files, etc.
 Thanks!

 I have always used Exchange at previous jobs so far, but at my new employer Kerio Connect 9.4.2 is in use. And I am still trying to get used to it. Now I have 2 questions: 
 1.When setting up a mail account, we do document the default password assigned to each account in the process, but many users change it later. The problem: if a user falls ill, we would like to add an absence note for his mails. The easiest way to do this would be directly in the user account, but to log in there I would need his password. Is there a way to set up an out of office notification in the dashboard with the admin account as well ? 
 2.Sometimes it is also desired that another user simply takes care of the account of the sick user temporarily. The easiest solution would probably be to simply give the user the sick user's credentials...if we know them. Well, in Exchange it was comparatively simple: You simply gave the substitute access rights to the mailbox of the sick user and could then set up his account in Outlook, even without knowing his password. With Kerio I haven't found such a possibility yet. Is there such a possibility to give another user access to a mailbox ?

And there is a VPS with pfSense without a LAN network - only WAN. I need to combine office networks via IPsec so that they can see each other, but with a centralized connection via VPS with pfSense (this is a prerequisite). The problem is that the old Zyxel routers do not support either Routed IPsec or OpenVPN, so you need to use only IPsec.
 I don't understand how to configure IPsec on pfSense VPS without a LAN network, and what Phase2 policies to prescribe so that office networks can see each other.

 Looking to potentially implement some more effective phishing/email attack testing against my end users.
 I'm just wondering what people are using these days.
 The main things I am looking for is that the templates are actually good, more resembling spear phishing then your general blanket generic phish, or easily converted to resemble them. Things like if it were to masqueared as a onedrive shared file it looks legit. The ability to replicate things like O365 MiTM attacks and more complex attacks would be great.
 I trust pretty much all my users to spot the obvious low effort phish, but recently due to how public the business is we get a lot spear phishing. We stop 99% of them but have had a few incidents where people have clicked through onto them, and frankly for the ones that have gotten through the various filtering I don't blame them. They were good phish emails, branded up, using peoples names, and coming from legit domains it looks like our business would have dealings with leading to legit looking phish pages.

I've ran into an issue with our network layout and I've been working with HP's TAC for weeks now and have seemed to accomplished nothing but to circle around to my original problem. I'm hoping there might be someone here that better understands Aruba's wireless solution to help me make a bit of progress.
 I've ran into an issue where with our branch locations, even though traffic can traverse between the controller and the AP, it can't establish a IKEv2 tunnel. Due to this it continuously has the AP reboot. Related, it seems that the tunnels continuously renegotiating eventually overloads the VM and causes it to drop. Both of these issues seem to be resolved with disabling CPSec. (Which the TAC recommended as a remedy)

It's a full key man dependency with all the admin accounts etc sitting with me. I've argued against this for a long time but the business doesn't "have the resource" to hire a second or train an existing person to be the second.
 Now for the processes, that's all documented and ready to be given/read, however what do I do about admin accounts? For some products we have specific admin accounts, but I'm unable to give passwords/access because the person who is replacing me hasn't been hired yet, so doesn't have an email address I can give those details to. 
 For some products, we don't have specific admin accounts as its licence based (tight company) and the admin just resides with me. I could make someone else in the team an admin but they won't have the foggiest what to do with it and when the new IT bod comes along they wont have a clue how to transfer admin rights.
 What am I meant to do in this situation? How can I best facilitate an actual handover of administrative rights and privileges

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I am working towards an FSRM solution that triggers an email alert and action when a blacklisted ext is uploaded on all of our File Servers. I tried a whitelist approach but this will not work in our environment.I am pulling the blacklist from the famous https://fsrm.experiant.ca/.
 ​
 I have been back and fourth with our infosec team and my own research on what is the best course of action if a user does upload a blacklisted file type. Most people online say to do an SMB denial, some want to do a network kill switch, and some want to lock/disable the user account.
 ​
 The Infosec team did agree with my research after I suggested an SMB denial and disabling the AD account but after further research I feel this may not be the best solution. Reference here:https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6pq2uv/help\_with\_fsrm\_command\_to\_disable\_ad\_account/After I sent this new information, they decided to advise that we utilize Sentinel One's logging and then it can escalate from within S1 and then we can kill the network from the console or re-enable.
 ​
 What do other Sysadmins do for this?

 Here's a brief overview of our deployment plan:
 Scope: Total 4 sites (1 HQ and 3 remote)
 DNAC Cluster: We will have a DNAC cluster with three nodes located at our headquarters, ensuring high availability and redundancy.
 WLCs and PSNs: Each site will have two Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and two Policy Services Nodes (PSNs) to handle wireless connectivity and authentication.
 ISE PAN and MNT: At our headquarters, we plan to host ISE Primary Administration Node (PAN) and Monitoring (MNT) nodes for centralized management and monitoring.
 Integration with DNAC: We're integrating the PAN node with DNAC using PxGrid to leverage the capabilities of both platforms.
 Site Details:
 Each site consists of Catalyst 50+ switches, 300+ Catalyst Wi-Fi 6 WAPs, and 2000+ users.
 HQ and Remote Sites are connected over the Site-to-Site (VPN.
 We are working with a partner who will assist us with the design and deployment, but I firmly believe in the power of community knowledge. I know that the insights and experiences shared by professionals like you can significantly contribute to the success of our project.
 Additionally, we are considering deploying SD-Access, do you recommend its implementation in our deployment.
 So, I kindly request your suggestions, tips, and best practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I just installed an IDF in an outbuilding. I installed a switch with a single Aruba AP. The AP comes up on the controller and even claims to have 5 clients with assigned IP addresses--2 of which are this laptop and my iPhone--, but none of them work.
 So rather than dumping my whole env on you guys, can you teach me how to fish? It looks like the traffic is blocked somewhere, as if the VLANs were aligned from point A to point B, i.e. AP to access switch to core switch to router.
 Current config:
  
MDF Core Switch: I have the Wifi VLAN 92 Untagged Tagged on the trunk port to the IDF (#51).
 IDF Access Switch: I have the Wifi VLAN 92 Tagged Untagged on ports 17-20 (with WAP in port 19) and Untagged Tagged on the trunk port #28 (SFP).
  
Context:
  
Here's a network diagram and a sample of my VLAN config on the Core Switch.
 Core switch is TP-Link T1600-52PS.
 Access switch is the smaller 24-port version: TP-Link TL-SG2428P(new generation has diff model numbers, this used to be the T1600-28PS)
 VLAN 86 is Mgmt, 92 is Wifi, 99 is wall jacks (I didn't pick 'em: hold your applause)
  
Update 9:54 PM ET: I had the Tagged and Untagged labels backwards. Sorry for the confusion. Obviously, I don’t know what I’m doing.

After this 5th rejection I’m bummed out about my current situation and feel my only opportunity is to look at jobs that pay 2/3 of current salary just to get out but that’s not an option. Any way thanks for hearing a jack of all trades and failure at one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sure there is a reason for why we need RD and RTs separately. Reading up only gave vague distinctions but I haven't got a convincing answer why on a real deployment, we would want RD and RTs , 2 different entities, to distinguish routes. Is my understanding correct here:
 Say, you have 2 tenants, say Coke and Pespi, each with say, a number of departments (accounting, sales, etc) connected to a DC. You would have separate RD for each tenant on the router there at the DC. (Route-leaking from Pepsi to Coke is a different concept that theoretically would only need RDs ?). 
 Coming back to question, we would want export and import RT configured, because, say one satellite office of Pepsi only has a sales dept (with import RT B) and wouldn't routes from accounting dept (RT A), hence, RD: Distinguish a tenant, RT: export/import: Only import routes from a particular 'group' of routes even from the same tenant. Does this sound correct?

So is the subscription measured on the OLT port so say you have an XGSPON (10 gig port) and you spilt 1/64 do you sell each customer like say 300 meg and say that's oversubscription rate of 100 present ? What is a typical over subscription rate? Is that bandwidth to each subscriber limited by the how may time you split or is configured on the port?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the company I work for was bought out, all the great stuff happened, benefits cost more, no raise, no real good news for normal techs and all. We usually work on call in a rotation, work from home that week, and we are able to monitor everything and work for OT pay. Now its being rumored that they will not pay OT rates, still want us to work afterhours/on call, but their fix is to let us leave early, which is just offensive. Is this a standard across the board? Is this legal? When my rotation comes up, if I am asked this I don't think I can comply honestly, because it does not feel worthwhile to have my whole week sidelined, and potentially working afterhours (usually i hit a few calls but probably around 3-5 hours extra during my rotation) at my base pay, just wanted some kind support or some kind of resource or baseline so I know what I am potentially going to be walking into. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm super frustrated and don't know where to go next. On Thursday last week, we started having intermittent issues with our Comcast fiber service. As an example, we cannot get to finance.yahoo.com or secure.bankofamerica.com . HTTP/S , ping, trace route all fail. Some folks across the US cannot connect to the VPN (and some can). I put in a ticket and they blame our firewall (Barracuda). So, I put in a ticket with Barracuda, and they say it's an ISP issue. We then plug a laptop directly into the fiber switch to bypass Barracuda, and still having Internet issues.
 Trace route always times out after hitting 96.110.117.181, which whois says is comcast routing.
 I then took our comcast cable connection going to our secondary network and plugged it into our firewall. I set it so that it would be the primary gateway instead of our fiber gateway. Traffic works just fine (it's just slower). When I do a traceroute through the cable gateway, it takes a different route and does not hit 96.110.117.181.
 Comcast support keeps telling me the problem is our equipment and don't want to seem to acknowledge the issue is their routing.
 Am I missing something here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 In our project we use PLC to control field devices with remote IO modules. This communication between PLC and remote IOs is handled by the PLC proprietary Ethernet protocol for SIL4 (safety integrity level).
 For troubleshooting reasons, we need to analyze the packets flowing between PLC and remote IOs so we set the port mirroring option in communication module of PLC. We can see other protocol packets with their respective IO IPs (i.e NTP) or ping packets. However, we can not capture the application data packets (UDP) with Wireshark. We tried port mirroring from both COM module and managed switch (to eliminate COM module mirroring feature bug) but no chance. Neither setup could capture data packets. Managed switch we used is Ruggedcom.
 Is there any restriction/limitation in port mirroring to not mirror the proprietary protocols or something? Are there anyone used this feature in industrial Ethernet environment?

He makes ridiculous amounts of money, and seems like his focus has always been to advance himself, make tons of money, (which is nice when you're not coming off as an selfish prick telling folks to miss important family events). He also works late nights, and seems like is happy to do so. How do you even deal with these type of people? How do you even support these environments? His boss seems to be fine that he is still doing late night events after so many years, and it's funny to me that for all the work they put in, not once on how to actually build out a team and delegate properly. ugh.
 Edit- I also want to add, that I also do late night maintenances, but I couldn’t make a maintenance event few weeks ago due to family gathering which they were aware about. Manager was upset that I couldn’t make the event hence the post

 I work in pro-av but I'm also our resident network engineer. I purchased a Fluke MS2-KIT back in 2012. It's been great, but right now I am needing to replace several of the remote IDs and the #1 cap. 
 I know this means I need the MS2-IDK27 set and the MS2-WM. Both of these are very expensive replacements considering the cost I paid for the kit back in the day. I realize the same kit is almost double the cost now.
 I am considering moving to the LinkIQ kit, but I am wondering if there are better or more economical options that may or may not be Fluke. 
 I am obviously not going to put the money out for a DTX or full certification kit as this is a personal purchase. 
 What are you all using?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've heard time and time again that the best-practice for monitoring tools is to only ever be alerted on things that require action from an actual person. 
 I agree with that philosophy, it makes crystal clear sense. Here's the thing though: my workplace does not abide by that whatsoever, and it is intentional. 
 I've been trying and failing to clean up our SCOM environment since like March. 
 Every time I've approached my team and my boss about turning off an email alert that isn't actionable, I'm always met with "no, leave that on, I'd rather get the email than turn it off". 
 Every single person on my team receives hundreds of non-actionable alerts every single day. If you need information from a specific timeframe, you check your email alerts. Right clicking and 'mark all as read' is an every day occurrence. 
 Sending a message in Teams that says "you're about to get bombarded by emails from what I'm working on, just ignore them" is an every single day occurrence. 
 When we patch, we get thousands of email alerts that we have to sort through the following Monday every month. 
 I've tried telling my team that these alerts can be condensed into dashboards in SCOM where the information is just as accessible and your inbox stays clean. But they'd rather receive the emails. My boss is extremely clear on her stance that she'd rather get hundreds of non-actionable alerts per day and manually sort through them. 
 Do other places actually not do that? I'm putting a lot of effort into learning how SCOM works and how we can organize the data from SCOM to not rely on constant email spam. But my workplace wants the comstant email spam and has instructed me not to get rid of it. 
 Do you guys actually operate with the philosophy that emails should only be sent if an action is required?

I think traditionally someone would go out and get a CCIE/CCDE which would give them the knowledge to design and architect networks. Is this still the case? I recently renewed my CCNP and seems like I really had to drink the Cisco cool-aide on the most recent iteration of the test. I'm looking for more of a vendor agnostic fundamentals of network design and architecture.
 How many years experience would you say is required for this transition to take place?
 Because there is no Masters Degree is "Network Architecture" - what resources would you say give the best "education" in this pursuit?

 I have some Access Points connected to a Switch (HUAWEI in this case).
 I configured some trunk ports (with two VLANs) to some access point to propagate a GUEST network and a private network.
 Now I need to implement L2 port isolation ONLY for the GUEST network and leave the private network without isolation. Is this possible?
 Thanks.

But if you start missing (arbitrary) goals, then it's your problem, especially when poor leadership claims its a performance issue on your part, rather than a management issue on their side.

 What have the fine folks at r/sysadmin done to push back and get the headcount needed to accomplish their work, or reset goals based on a reasonable work schedule?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 First of all, thank you for your valuable input and time.
 I'm a rookie sysadmin working for a fairly small company, and I've recently been tasked with exploring database rack monitoring. As someone with no prior experience in this domain, the vast amount of information available can be quite overwhelming.
 Overall i'm looking for a not too expensive setup to monitor our racks with a motion sensor and camera. 
 We rent multiple racks in different data centers, and our manager wants us to monitor these racks 24/7. The monitoring system needs to operate effectively in various environmental conditions, such as cold/hot temperatures and low/high light sources. Ideally, we'd like a camera to activate and record video on one of the rack's servers when motion is detected. Additionally, we plan to dedicate a VM to manage the camera(s). Our requirements are relatively straightforward; we primarily need a camera to record any access to our equipment. 
 I've come across several recommendations from other sysadmins, with APC solutions being frequently mentioned. The NetBotz Camera Pod 165 appears to be a suitable camera option. However, I'm unsure if it can be used without a NetBotz rack monitor. I've also noticed suggestions for the Unifi camera solutions.
 Those solutions are extremely expensive for what we need to do. 
 ​
  
Would it be possible to simply use a webcam managed by the VM ? 
  
​
  
Are there good open-sourced project you experienced sysadmins are using for this particular use case scenarios ?
  
​
  
Which camera / webcams would be best suited for simply monitoring access to our racks? 
  
​
 I'm truly fresh out from school, we've done some image processing projects in python so maybe in the worse case I could improvise a cluncky script that launches everytime the VM boots up ?
 Apologies for the novice question, and I greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you can provide.
 Best regards,
 Ben

 Here is a screenshot of the issue from control panel: https://i.imgur.com/xajRxuv.png
 Basically GPO deployed printer is copy-pasted with the identical name many times (usually only 20 actual print queues) but now there are +200 duplicated entries. 
 What I have found out/know so far:
 - Issue seems to be limited to Xerox printers. The HP Printers seem to have no issue and are deployed the same way
 - The used printer driver is "Xerox Global Print Drivers PS" version 5733.1100.0.0 Typ 3
 - Medical environment. Many users per PC.
 - Afaik the issue is company-wide (50ish PCs). Not sure how wide though.
 - The device manager do NOT list the offending printer queue.
 - In Windows 10 menu -> Devices the printer is listed (several times) as "Driver not available".
 - If opened in the control panel -> printers you can not interact with it beyond 3 options: Remove device, troubleshoot device and (if I remember correctly from the client pc) properties.
 - Full Windows environment (Both client and servers).
 Tried searching the issue already and found out it seems to be a xerox-specific issue but don't really know where to start and still am kinda a rookie in many regards.
 Anyone had the same issue somewhere and know of a resource to fix it or to identify the problem better?

Just added 2 new printers, iR-ADV C359, and when we switch to PaperCut the control panel just goes to a white screen and won't load the app. We can still access the local menus such as 123.We have upgraded the server to the latest version (22.[something]) and also deployed the updated .jar file. 
 The server reports the printers are at 1.3.0.This seems to be a bigger issue than just my 2 new printers, anyone having this problem, and any workarounds?
 So far our vendor hasn't been much help.
 ETA: vendor assures us that the printers are supported and that the reason they aren't on the supported list is because they are too new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the UK, if it matters (240V).
 We have a new Eaton UPS that should be hardwired (9PX with extended battery module) Our server room has two 16A supplies, presented as "commando" female sockets (2P+E, IEC 60309).
 The user manual states a cable cross section of 4-16mm2 or 12-6 AWG, which seems oversized. It's possible to get up to 10mm2 as a flexible 3-core cable, but is it right? One end is terminated directly into the terminal block of the UPS, and I was hoping to have the other wired into a 16A commando plug so I can plug it in to the socket.
 (The electrician will be making the connections at each end, but have requested we source the cable and plug).
 I'm happy to source the 10mm2 cross section cable if it sounds right and would fit in a 16a connector. Length is a few metres between UPS and socket so cost is not an issue.

 User sync only works one way from onpremises to cloud when adconnect is configured. but when AD DC is configured with password requirements that is at odds with the password configuration in microsoft 365. when a user resets their password in the cloud, ms365 generates a password that doesn't match the AD DC policy which creates a conflict. how to solve a problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some advice from my fellow sysadmins with regards to backup of MS/Office 365.
 We've been using Veeam for a couple of years (on-prem backup server), and IMHO it's been working quite well.
 But one of my co-workers is sceptical to the whole concept of having all our files, e-mails, etc stored on an on-prem server - in case it gets compromised, then we have a huge problem. So he does have a valid point, even if we have done everything possible to avoid this (separate network, server is only accessible indirectly, etc). 
 So currently, we're running the backups manually (boot server, run backup, shut down server again) once a month or so.
 Now that our Veeam licenses are about to expire, we are considering not renewing the licenses and live without backups and rather rely on the various safety features in MS365.
 What would you guys do?

 I'm no sysadmin, currently more of a very low level support. Think google workspace administration, sitting down with a coworker if they switch from Win to Mac to explain some basics for example, and the omnipresent "why is the printer not working", that sort of think ...
 My question for you guys is - where to read about a "proper" business IT setup? By that I mean how things should run in a professional setting, compared to private users. I know local accounts are not the way to go, nor is setting up 20 devices in a row manually, or purchasing one MS Office license at a time, running MDM ... but where can I learn about the correct procedures?
 This place can get confusing. I can read and try to understand what ADDS is, or GPO, PDQ inventory, FOG deployment, and a bunch of other terms, but it doesn't help much for the overall picture
 If you got a moment to help out, thank you.

 I am a IT tech working on becoming a sysadmin myself. A step in this plan is solving an issue with outlook. 
 My company uses Salesforce to collect and synchronize email signatures on outlook.
 Ever since we started deploying windows 11, We have been facing a comfort issue for a lot of users. 
 The issue is the salesforce signatures synchronize on outlook and appear under signatures on this device. Though the signatures appear here we are unable to select them in the choose default signature block. 
 We are using outlook version 2304 on window 11 22H2. 
 If anyone has any lead for a solution I will be forever grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around the end of April, some of the mailbox rules in Outlook stopped automatically moving messages to their appropriate folders in my inbox. These rules have worked unchanged for years. I've tried recreating, enabling/disabling, deleting Outlook program files associated with mailbox rules but nothing in my googling or help from Microsoft has resolved my issue yet. Microsoft 365 support is still investigating.
 A couple weeks ago I noticed an Exchange Online transport rule not working as it has in the past. It looks at sender domain, if the sender if outside the org, and dmarc=pass, dmarc=bestguesspass in the header of messages to determine if the message should bypass spam filtering. Now it appears it won't bypass spam filtering if the message is sent to more than one recipient, even if the rule is a match. I find this strange since the rule doesn't check recipient information at all.
 Anyone else experiencing any shenanigans with Outlook rules or Exchange Online transport rules?

She noticed that after connecting via rdp, the resolution on the desktop PC changes, but when she changes it back to the previous setting, the image is still off and there are some parts that are completely cut off like the taskbar. Turns out opening up the intel graphics control panel and changing the setting to "Adjust to screen" (or something like that iirc) fixed it. 
 Is there any way to prevent RDP from messing with these settings? If not, at least some way to automatically change them back when the computer starts up again.

 Sometimes, you luck out and stumble across an extremely simplified solution to what seems to be a complex task, and it absolutely rocks your world with how easy the task just became.
 Many times, these solutions are considered "common knowledge", and you scratch your head whenever someone around you has their mind blown.
 The thing is, what you may think of as common knowledge is something that someone else in the same role as you has never heard of. Yet.
 If you're like me, you've failed up into your current SysAdmin-ish role by pure random happenstance, tenacity, failing better (meaning that you fail, learn, and move on to the next more complex failure, learning again, and moving on... you get my drift), and turning a hobby into a career. You drink from a firehose your entire professional life and earn your scars through pure experience, frustration, and one or two nervous breakdowns. I'd spare anyone that last experience if I could.

 I'm currently facing an issue with VMware Horizon 8 and instant-clone image publishing, and I could really use some assistance. Whenever I try to publish my instant-clone image, I encounter the following error message in Horizon:
 "Publish Error:
 Fault type is AGENT_CUSTOMIZATION_FAULT - Internal template vm-542704 customization failed. Error description not set by agent."
 I've already attempted a couple of troubleshooting steps, but unfortunately, the problem persists. Here's what I've tried so far:
 Removing AV software: I thought that the AV might be interfering with the publishing process, so I temporarily uninstalled it from the system. However, this didn't resolve the issue. See here; https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90781 
 Using sysprep instead of clone: In an attempt to overcome the customization failure, I switched from using the clone method to sysprep. Despite this change, the error message still pops up.
 I'm now at a loss for what to do next. Have any of you encountered a similar error while publishing instant-clone images in VMware Horizon 8? If so, I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have to help me resolve this problem.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

 I have to configure OSPF neighbouship between my MLS (multilayer switch) and my VPN concentrator for redundancy reasons.
 The issue is that the VPN concentrator's public IP address is in the subnet of a secondary IP address of the MLS as illustrated in the following diagram :
 https://prnt.sc/DhSexwCBLcdz
 From what I know, OSPF only sends hello packets from the primary IP address. Meaning that even if I declare the 10.10.20.0 network in OSPF and make the interface active, VPN won't receive any OSPF hello packet.
 What is the best way in that situation to form a neighbourship between these two devices?

 In the past week I'm learning how to set up a CA server. During my research I'm noticed EC certificates are preferred, BUT most of the guide is still RSA. Also noticed that most of the guide is too basic, not explainin lots of things.
 I'm trying to create a guide for myself, when I'm done I will share it somewhere. Most likely I will not use this instead of vault/let's encrypt/windows CA etc... But I want to learn the certificates in depts.

 I've been looking at the options of sharing from the OD, but I'm not keen on the Dev sharing a file direct from the OD via email. (He is under a business use case and special group to allow him to do it btw) Ideally I want no connection from user to Dev OneDrive.
  
 It seems the best option I can find is to have some kind of sharing site he is allowed to upload the file to, then the customers gets an email with a time limited download.
  
 So questions.
  
1) Does anyone know secure sites that would fit the bill?
 2) Is there a way to build something like a simple download site in AWS? We could put up something in AWS if needed. (Not my area but we have some knowledge)
 3) Does anyone have any links that they could point me too for what's need to make that in AWS?
 4) Or any other suggestions

 my hoster told me that he will end his service till the end of the month. I am running quite critical things on this service. I am able to get by backups in a .img.gpg format by the hoster. Now I need a VPS-Service where I can upload the last backup in this format to move without long downtime.
 My current setup is
 4GB RAM
 2vCores
 200GB storage
 100 Mbit up/down
 Located in Germany
 ​
 I could take some more RAM, storage and vCores. But it is not necessary.
 Are there any (pricey) services that are capable of this setup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve posted a few times and I’ve seen many others bring up that a lot of us may be misclassified as exempt when you should be non exempt. 
 The DOL has information that in my reading would be hard to argue that any IT position is non exempt, falling under the professional exemption. You need college/training to support IT systems and as long as you’re paid the minimum - how would you argue a position is non exempt otherwise?
 https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17a-overtime
 I tried searching this sub (I didn’t look very hard or long) and didn’t find any posts of people saying they were able to fight their exempt status.
 Have you seen or heard of anyone fighting their exempt status?
 Edit: Here’s an example of someone winning but their job was more helpdesk, not sysadmin https://www.dkattorneys.com/publications/personnel-exempt-flsa-overtime-requirement/ We as sysadmins have some say in the design of IT systems.

 I have my certificate authority handing out Radius certs for the WiFi clients. I can see the initial connection is established using TCP 135 and then it will use a random RPC port range from 49152-65535. Is there a way I can have my certificate authority communicate over a small range of ports. I want to avoid opening up the entire 49152-65535 range to all my end user devices so that they can just enroll in a radius WiFi certificate.

 He reaches out to our ISP to schedule a call to discuss a new location and instead of coordinating it for a time I’m scheduled to work, he schedules for a day I’m not working, acknowledges I’m not working in the email and another team mate (who knows nothing about our network) can join. 
 Later, he asks me in person to join if I can. I thought about it but I didn’t even get the meeting invite and no, It’s not urgent, It’s my day off. Waiting two days to have the call wouldn’t cause any problems. 
 I think he’s expecting me to work more than my 40 at this point on a regular basis. I don’t and I will fight to not to or be compensated with additional time off. We’ve already been short 2.5 people for almost a year and I’m behind on everything - I’m at the point where only the squeaky wheels are getting grease - 95% of my time is spent on helpdesk and I’m even falling behind on helpdesk tickets.
 I was looking for a new job but stopped to see how the new boss would work out and if he could get us back on track. Concerned, I might need to start looking again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advice here. So I am a younger guy currently working in helpdesk trying to move to a full sysadmin role. At my company, Head of IT has always encouraged me to grow. In my performance review last year, he said he wanted me in a sysadmin role by Fall of this year. My company offers a bonus/certification program that pays for and gives bonuses for passing certain exams. So I have been taking advantage of this program and getting the certs as others have done. Others have gotten these certs and no one has ever batted an eye about it. In the past 2 months, I have been doing a lot of studying and got 4 certs on our in our certification program. On the last 3, my boss has been really slow to respond about them and follow up with HR/Finance so I get the bonus. Now, after my last cert I got, he emailed me back quickly saying to stop getting certs for now and he needs to talk to the CTO about it. Someone on my team got the exact same certs and they were praised for it, but when I do I am told to stop? I am just trying to grow into the role that I want at this company and I am confused as to why he wants me to stop my growth. I mean I understand if he doesn't want people taking advantage of the bonuses and then leaving, but I have been with this company the entirety of my career in IT (I am young so not that many years). 
 I understand I am in a unique situation and I don't know if other companies offer things like this. Any advice? Am I overthinking? Should I ask him about it? All feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading.
 Edit: I don’t believe that it is budget or cost related. There have been other people in the past who have gotten certifications that grant bonuses that are double mine, and they were encouraged to keep going. I am leaning more that it is him wanting to protect the company and from people getting a bunch and then leaving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Work for smaller ISP that has recently started doing more B2B service. We’ve been whitelisting the few public IPs for port forwards to our ordering and provisioning systems and creating the tenant/admin account and allow those businesses/admins to complete all their own onboarding for their users. This is quickly becoming not scalable though. We are planning on setting up an SSL Web VPN page on a Fortigate with bookmarks to the individual services they need to access but trying to find a solution for the Fortigate VPN accounts. 
 Ideally we would create the single new admin account for the business and then allow them to create all their own users as they hire/fire. Trying to figure out the best solution for a Radius/LDAP server for the Fortigate to use for authentication that we can configure each tenant on and allow them to build/remove users without seeing the other tenants obviously. I tried to look at FreeIPA and it’s use of realms but that doesn’t seem to work as I expected it would. 
 Our current internal Radius server is just TACACS fed by a MySQL backend which is fine for us to run SQL query’s for the couple of user changes we have per year but that’s obviously not ideal for this B2B use case. 
 Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Microsoft released a patch to fix a Secure Boot bypass bug used by the BlackLotus bootkit we reported on in March. The original vulnerability, CVE-2022-21894, was patched in January, but the new patch for CVE-2023-24932 addresses another actively exploited workaround for systems running Windows 10 and 11 and Windows Server versions going back to Windows Server 2008.
 The BlackLotus bootkit is the first-known real-world malware that can bypass Secure Boot protections, allowing for the execution of malicious code before your PC begins loading Windows and its many security protections. Secure Boot has been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet the software's system requirements.
 An attacker who successfully deployed BlackLotus on a targeted system could obtain complete control over the OS boot process—giving them “almost the same capabilities as firmware implants, but without having to overcome the multilevel SPI flash defenses…or the protections provided by hardware (like Intel Boot Guard),”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I seem to have a bad habit of jumping from the frying pan into the fire when accepting new roles these last few years. Examples are:
 ​
  
Roles listed as fully remote and put as fully remote in the contract, and then told two months in I need to relocate immediately or be fired
 Multiple managers fighting over what tasks I should be assigned and asking me to convince my managers to allow me to work on things or be dismissed (why did you hire me then?)
 Asked to frequently travel and told I will not be reimbursed
 Onboarding consisting of being given an employee ID and the phone number for the help desk; team leads too busy to do onboarding but will ask for status on projects I don't even know about, etc
  
What kind of questions can someone ask during the interviews to try and suss out these kind of crazy situations? I understand this is a time of complete chaos for a lot of companies and onboarding in our field is always a bit sink or swim, but this is well beyond what I'm used to. One question I'm planning to ask next time is "can you describe your onboarding process?" and "who will I report to? Are there multiple individuals I am expected to report to? If so, what strategies do you have to ensure alignment between their priorities?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm in the middle of migrating our current WAN facing firewalls (ASA and Firepower) to Palo Alto 3320's. With Firepower, the concept of "trying" (because, Firepower) to block a URL is a case of putting the URL on the rule, then block/allow depending. At the moment, I've mimicked the Firepower structure, in the sense that I've created the URL Category entries and applied them to the Security Rules. Apologies for not having this completely accurate, but I did a POC last with Palo Alto and I remember that it wasn't as straightforward as building out the rules like I have currently. There where "dependencies" and other categories involved in order for it to work. I've forgot exactly how I went about perfecting it in the end. I think I had the URL rules setup like I do currently, but I had a catch all for low risk categories etc... at the bottom, so the rest of the webpage URL's can be downloaded to.
 I know the rule setup in Palo Alto isn't as straightforward or "obvious" as say, Firepower, I know Firepower sucks overall, but I need to wrap my head around the best way to structure rules for the Palo again.

 Here's an example. I have been tasked with setting up a new server. Currently, a large amount of employees use software that relies on a server. We're planning on replacing the server. I was wanting to use DNS to point to the new server using the old server's name to avoid having to reconfigure a large number of computers and applications.
 My coworkers don't like the idea. They would like to update all the computers and applications instead. I'm concerned about missing some computers and having upset employees.
 In addition, I proposed that we could update all the applications with a new name for the server, but use something more generic than the servers name so that when we do this next time, we won't have this problem. My coworkers didn't like that either.
 Am I wrong? Do I need to rethink my strategies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I installed EVE-NG after having massive issues getting Cisco FTDv and FMCv running in GNS3. I managed to get both VMs up and running, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to get connectivity between the two devices. 
 One issue is that when I built a "network", and drag connections to the FTD/FMC, it does not provide me any options to declare "which" interface I want to connect to. If I could do that, it would not matter which network I built between them, it should work. I don't need internet access from the VMs, I just want them to talk to each other. 
 Now, this is not that big of an issue on the FMC, as there only seems to be one interface connected, and I have put it on the same network as the FTDv. 
 But I think the core issue is.. From the look of the interfaces, both devices are using loopbacks as the interface connected to switch in EVE-NG. I don't want to change the IPs on those interfaces, for fear that I lose the ability to console into the devices, which is currently working through the EVE-NG web console.
 ​
 On both FMCv and FTDv, both eth0 interfaces are configured for the desired management network. But the Transmit/Receive statistics on these interface show they are not connected in EVE-NG. So, given I don't seem to have the ability to specify which interfaces on the VM I want to use, how on earth do I connect the two eth0 interfaces in EVE-NG?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 I work at a medium-sized company (4-5K Corporate Users with about 50 US-based offices) that is working towards moving to SDWAN. Currently today we run on full Cisco Hardware - C8Ks, ISR 4Ks, and Cat 3850 and 9K Switches, with no other vendor hardware deployed at our branches. Within our Datacenter we have a pair of c8500s that aggerate our WAN Connections and run as DMVPN Hubs. We run a legacy design at all our branches with MPLS running as the Primary Transport and DMVPN as the Failover if we experience LEC or provider issues on the MPLS side. With this design, we route all traffic external to the branch to our main Hub no matter the destination… Internet or On-Prem infrastructure. Years ago, this was great for us because we only had to manage one firewall pair that handled al…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few months, I researched cloud WAN architectures (think of Azure OneWAN, so private infra between sites, i.e., PoPs or datacenters). The more I research them, the more I am convinced that they are really just like big (e.g., Tier 1 AS) internet service provider (ISP) networks. Cloud service providers (CSPs) face the same challenges and appear to use fundamentally similar technologies, except that they might be more "agile" in adopting new tech such as the latest flavor of SDN. Both do traffic estimation, traffic engineering, many CSPs also use MPLS tunnels like many ISPs, etc.
 Thus, my question: What are differentiating factors between a CSP WAN (think Azure's OneWAN) and a large ISP network?

 My motorcycle is a bmw adventure bike, it's quiet and polite. It's very very far from some loud nasty Harley or dousche sport bike. I have Kevlar "chinos" and plain black protective mid tops(think converse is but just all black with a tan sole). I can leave my jacket in a luggage case on the bike too. 
 So I should pretty much look the normal part when I'm interfacing with them, I'm just curious if they saw or it came up if it might come off poorly or reflect against my company. 
 I'm probably over thinking this and I'm sure it's fine, I just would like to hear other people's thoughts. The big motivation I have for this is two fold: I get milage reimbursed and my bike gets like 60mpg VS my explorer getting 18-20mpg, so I'll make out good on it. Secondly, I just like to ride and every mile on the bike is a good one.

 I was able to setup and deploy a Mac Pro from ABM and assign it a profile in Azure. Setup went smooth and it pulled down all the required apps and management profile. One of the required apps is our company portal.
 When I open up Company Portal it tells me it hasnt been set up for corporate use yet and to begin setup. It then wants to download and install the same management profile that was installed during automatic enrollment so it fails and I can't use company portal.
 When I check azure it shows the device has been enrolled and is compliant so I'm at a loss how to bypass this check by company portal. I even tried to go and assign it through portal.manage.microsoft.com and that didn't help.

 If you work on a team that rotates weekend shifts, do you get the following Monday off? We only have a couple weekend shift per quarter and all generally work 9-5 mon-fri.I'm working my first weekend shift and realizing they expected me to come in Monday.
 That's 12 days in a row unless I use my personal PTO(which i did for monday). That's not illegal it just seems insane and it is literally the legal limit in Cali. I've worked drive troughs, shitty retail, waited tables, gone from help desk to sysad in one org working very hard... I've been in the Army Infantry...
 Other than deployment and 1 BIG exercise per year for training, I don't think I've ever been expected to work 12 days in a row. Is this normal? I know tons of orgs rotate weekend shift, just curious if you get comped on the back end or not.

 If you had to transfer, say, 1 PetaByte from your office in San Francisco to another office in New York, how would you go about doing it?
 My guess is there are 2 ways:
  
use rsync to transfer over the internet.
 
clone the data onto a HDD, and fly it across to New York.
 
 The first solution is cheaper (depending on your ISP) but may require plenty of time, weeks and even months (correct me if I'm wrong).
 The second solution might be quicker but slightly expensive.
 I'm wondering if anyone here has some experience with this?

 Scrub admin here. I'm having issues with getting kerberos auth to work with a Postgres RDS instance. Followed official AWS guides on how to enable it. Enabled Password and Kerb auth on the instance, linked it to a managed AWS DC, created users on the db ([user@bone.dog.woof](mailto:user@bone.dog.woof)), and added them to the rds_ad group (user I'm trying to log in as exists on the DC as well). I then threw in the krb5.ini file under C:\Windows that points to the domain/realm. Issue is when I try to connect with domain creds via pgadmin with kerby enabled, I get a SSPI context error. Using dBeaver, it's KDC_Err_Client_Revoked.
 Using Windows to accomplish this not Linux if that's important to know.
 Anyone have experience with this before and know what I'm missing?

 We have a user that works remotely sometimes as well at the office, and some of the time when connecting through RDP the machine rejects the password when connecting remotely. When this happens, we try connecting the user locally and it works fine, try again remotely and it fails. 
 The odd this is sometimes when this happens, when we try a different machine/location sometimes it will work sometimes not. But if we reboot the machine it seems to work fine
 As far as I can tell from Event Viewer there does not seem to be any errors generated when this happens unless there is some other logging that I need to turn on.
 These are both Windows 10 machines and all updates are done, and outside of the common check username and password are valid I am not finding anything specific to this.
 Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know a lot of people say absolutely never do this, but hear me out. Dual Juniper switches, setup in a virtual chassis config - each model being 48 port 10GbE with 40GbE interconnects.
 In a small setup (3x VM servers and 1x SAN), why not do this? The switch can handle different MTU/Jumbo Frames per port, VLANs etc (so all storage networks can be on their own VLANs). In the virtual chassis setup it means no chance of config differences between switches. Controller A of the SAN could go to Switch 1, and Controller B of the SAN could go to Switch 2, so full redundancy.
 The VM servers would have 4x ports per server - 2x of which would be for VM traffic and their associated VLANs, and 2x would be for the SAN traffic. Again would go between switches, so a single switch failure would have no downtime.
 Can anyone give a good argument on this setup on why this shouldn't be done?

I got the self-study bundle a while back and am scheduled to take the exam toward the end of the month. I started looking up practice questions, however, and noticed there's a lot of questions that were absolutely not covered by the study material I have. Are these older / no longer relevant questions or is my study material simply lacking? For example: What is the basic unit of framing in SDH and the bit rate for its transmission? I just did a ctrl+f on my study guide and there are only 3 spots that SDH is mentioned and none of them describe the bit rate.
 Obviously I can Google the answers but there's a LOT of questions on those online practice exams. I can already pass the provided practice exam. Actually I took the provided practice test before even reading the material and I passed, barely. I expect now that test would be easy. I'm just worried about questions not covered.

I get tons of interviews whenever I'm looking to advance my career, so I'm clearly a desirable candidate. But I never get past that first interview. Usually it's the standard "you'll hear from us" and that's that. But one dude who interviewed me for a night shift position at an NOC actually said to my face he didn't think I could do it.
 So, you've already interviewed 5 other candidates whose retinas aren't scarred, and I walk in with a dog and dark glasses. Everything you know about me comes from my resume, which up until this point has put me on the same footing as the other 5 candidates. How do I sell myself?

 So now seems like as good of time as any to check out some forums as a good potential replacement.

 I did this a few times, verifies it perfectly. Contacted support 2 days ago. The case was then escalated and died. Opened a new case this morning, and escalated again. I do not expect to receive a response.
 MigrationWiz went to crap recently. What gives?

 Is there something I can do in the IOS XR configuration in order for BE interfaces to have a more permanent OID?

 The NICs are both Intel Corporation 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection (Lewisville) (rev 04) &
 The switch looks like a TP-Link TL-SG1008D (looks like it, haven't got physical access to it currently).
 I am only getting 30 MB/s which seems very slow. I tested the disks and they are both over 100 MB/s.
 This seems rather slow. The box is not doing anything else significant. I used iotop.
 My guess is it's the cables can remember where they came from but it may have been eBay or Amazon.
 Does this sound likely or is there something I have missed? I'm thinking of getting replacements from somewhere repeatable in the UK like eBuyer or https://cpc.farnell.com.
 What do people think?

 My business currently has me as the IT manager, small team of 3 and a development manager, team of 7. 
 The development manager is leaving and I’ve been offered to take over the managing of both teams. Now I know nothing about development really, at most I use powershell and cli etc. 
 They’re going to bring in a product manager below me to assist in deciding what new features to target and speccing it out, so most of my day to day would be people management and escalation in terms of the dev team. The IT team is going to get an apprentice at the bottom end to help move people up to fill any gaps when I’m not doing my day to day. 
 So two question’s really 
 1- has anyone managed a development team with minimal knowledge, and do you have any info or tips? 2- what would this role be called? Seems like a chance to bump out my CV a bit so want to make the most of it. 
 Thanks

 I've moved them away from Office and Outlook to web based GSuite. The CRM will integrate with GSuite through the browser. File management will be primarily scanned documents and saved PDFs going onto Google Drive and the CRM. 
 Browsers will be Chrome, probably managed through Google Workspace, uBlock origin installed. 
 Password management either via Google password manager or Bitwarden. 
 Remote support is currently provided by Teamviewer, but I don't' think they're on a paid plan, so I'm sure that will get cut off soon, and so I'll give Chrome Remote Desktop a go unless an alternative good value solution can be suggested?
 Not sure if I should be doing any special configs with Windows?
 Is it worth having a dedicated AV in an office environment in addition to Defender? If so, what are people using?
 Any advise or links to best practices guides would be appreciated on how to approach a small business deployment like this. Thank you

 ​
 we will receive a Canon Selphy CP1500 soon - in most usecases the printer will be used in wi-fi direct prints, but it may be necessary to connec tit to the local wifi.
 I want to put it in printer vLAN, but i can't find documentation on what ports are needed
 i found documention for canon business printers, but i guess i won't need all of these ports and i only want to allow the necessary minimum
 ​
 has someone experience with canon selphy printers in this regard or with canon printers in general to guess what the bare minmum ports for printing would be?
 thank you for your advice!

 I've only ever used RDS for sessions, not for VDI.
 For VDI I know I need to make a Windows image that the end users will get. But for updating the image with patches or installing new software, can I just update the existing the image and VDI will pick that up, or do I have to update the image and provision it again?
 I'm just a bit confused on once I have the template Win 10 image, how do I keep it up to date

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using a Hyper-V to simulate a network, as I'm building a Group Policy from the ground on up. I have three VMs:
 FS Windows 2019: Network Adapters
  
DCComm [for 'Domain Controller' Communication only] - 192.168.5.15/255.255.255.0/192.168.5.2)
  
My DC: Network adapters 
  
DCComm (192.168.5.10/255.255.255.0/192.168.5.2))
 MyPVT (Communication Between Clients and DC) (192.168.4.10/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.2))
 Ethernet (Auto Assign IP)
  
MyClient: Network Adapters:
  
MyPVT (192.168.4.150/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.2))- Used to access the Internet, through the DC
  
The idea is to use Group Policy Management Console on MyDC to create a folder and copy files to MyClient. I tried first by using a share on my host network, which did not work. The share was going to be USB attached storage from a router, and my DC could not see that.
 I then created a second Windows Server 2019 PC strictly for file shares (detailed above as FS Windows 2019). I deliberately put those on another network (using another virtual adapter) , thinking this would prohibit direct access by the clients. Both DC and FS servers can ping each other, and my DC server can access the share folder on the FS server, but Group Policy is not copying over the files. The folder created correctly.
 To create the folder, I'm using the path: User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Folders and created a folder here with the action being to Update.
 For files, User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Files. Same thing, I'm using the Update action.
 Again, the Folder creation worked, but the file copy did not. Why not and how can I fix this? Any ideas?

 But, essentially, I don't treat or think of the IT department in the same business model as the GeekSquad or any other tech service provider. I try my hardest to avoid calling anyone in the organization a "client" because I don't want to encourage this service provider/recipient dynamic. As far as I'm concerned, my function in the org. is to keep the information technology systems and processes working, NOT provide value to you in the form of "customer service". In most situations, "good customer service" and the necessary protocols and SOPs go hand in hand. When they don't, STOP going up the chain of command or berating my "dedication to quality service" because you didn't get what you want, how you want. I am your fucking co-worker doing my part to keep this shit floating, not someone you hired to do as you want.

 I’ve been trying to implement option 156 in KEA DHCP as outlined in this forum : 
 https://www.shoretelforums.com/forum/shoretel-tech/administrators/650-how-to-configure-option-156-in-linux-dhcpd
 The option has been defined as a string , and I set CSV to true, as I want multiple values to be sent to the clients.
 Unfortunately KEA doesn’t accept “array of strings” as a valid option and will not start.
 After removing the array line, predictably , only the first value is sent to the client and it appears to be a decimal string not a string the same way it was configured.
 Based off this guidance 
 https://ftp.ripe.net/mirrors/sites/ftp.isc.org/isc/kea/1.5.0/doc/kea-guide.html#dhcp4-custom-options
 I am hoping to specify the option as a “record” and specify multiple data types and pray it accepts it.
 Unfortunately I feel this won’t work because “When array is set to true and type is set to "record", the last field is an array, i.e., it can contain more than one value ” will probably just complain about an array of strings again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 Sorry if this has been asked a million times.
 I'm quite new to BGP, I know that iBGP doesn't change attributes mainly the next hop. How do Large ISPs generally configure their BGP networks?
 Would they have hundreds of routers within an iBGP AS, using route reflectors, changing editing the next-hop IP and injecting null routes to bring the BGP prefixes into the routing tables
 Or do they have hundreds of small iBGP AS's with 5-6 routers inside all linked together using eBGP?
 The first way was how I did my EVE lab, but was getting tricky/lot of work to implement (around 15 routers).
 Or do they have another method that I haven't thought of?
 Thanks

 I am a little confused and am just looking for some thoughts or feedback on an issue. I have a client that uses an iPhone 6 to stream Pandora in their workshop. The issue is, I can see the device is connected to the Unifi AP (U6-Pro) but the traffic going to and from the iPhone is... Pausing? Pandora loses connection and requires someone to turn the screen on and then it starts playing again.
 I have been pinging the device for a while and I can see there is traffic for a few seconds, like it's checking in, then nothing for another few minutes. Now if someone actually goes and plays Pandora again it will ping for several minutes then the ping stops followed by the music, still connected to WiFi.
 My thought is that there is some kind of "WiFi Pausing" feature that doesn't disconnect the WiFi but pauses the connection? It looks like it's only 2 iOS devices doing this, all other devices remain consistently pingable.
 Device is iPhone 6 on iOS 12.5.7 - No Power Saving Options are on and the Phone is constantly plugged in.
 UAPSD is off
 Thank you in advance!

The VNID is what is needed to distinguish routes when a leaf advertises any type EVPN route to the fabric. But if EVI and VNID are same, why should there be two terms?

 Assuming there's already a source of truth configured, and I just need the ACL configuration and deployment bit.

 I have a question about what certificates I should have on a new pair of HA Palo Alto 3320's that I'm setting up, these are severing as our hosted WAN firewalls, we'll be doing SSL inbound inspection on them.
 The main caveat is that the hosted servers that users go to when they go through our hosted NAT rules, are all F5 VIP's, normally, I would just be putting the servers pub/priv key pair of the firewalls, but since none of them are technically where the user goes to when they establish an SSL connection, the F5 VIPs acts as the destination for the NAT rules whenever the hosting IP's are connected to.
 It may seem like an obvious question, but in this case, don't I just use the pub/priv keypair that are on the F5 client SSL profile instead of the servers certificates themselves in a normal instance?
 One bonus question as well, for the decryption policy on the PA, am I right in saying that the scr zone would be the outside, scr ip "any", dst zone (the relevant next hop zone) and the dst ip as the private IP, being the VIP, not the public IP that users will connect to? (I guess the same sort of question applies to the NAT and security policy rules to, that's how I've currently set it all up)
 Thanks all

Currently, it's possible to create a bond with only a single network defined, and CentOS allows this. I can see how this might be useful during a configuration process, e.g. as a means of keeping bond settings around to copy from while configuring another, etc., but that's just UI sugar.
 Is there any use case for keeping it this way? We're trying to figure out if we want our GUI to even allow it. Our product owner thinks that CentOS accepting a single-interface configuration at all should be considered a bug in linux.

 This might be a stupid question... We are trying to upgrade from Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.9.1 to 3.10.3. I have never done this and documents explain how to backup 3.9, uninstall it, then install 3.10 and restore the backup into it. But doesn't explain which version to use that is available on their website? We are using a VM to run out Prime Infrastructure at the moment and are going to use VM for the new version. Which version of Prime Infrastructure do I need? I see these:
  
Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.10 ISO image for the physical appliance. Run, openssl dgst -sha512 -verify CiscoPI3.10.pem -signature PI-APL-3.10.0.0.205-1-K9.iso.signature PI-APL-3.10.0.0.205-1-K9.iso from the command line.
 Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.10 OVA for the virtual appliance
  
From the names alone, it tells me I need to download #2. Is that correct?

 We own a small commercial building with a little more than 48 ports in the building. 15 or so go to our own company, and the rest of the building is for executive suites that we rent out to tenants. One tenant may be solo, and another may be 3-4 employees. So whatever product we use needs to be able to isolate the tenants to their own secure network. Beyond this, fairly intuitive interface, good security, and any other bells and whistles that may be beneficial to an executive suites building would be great.
 All that said, they are suggesting Sonicwall. I get the sense that this is just who they've been using for a long time. They speak highly of the product they put out... but I did a little reading on a few posts and found they don't have the best reputation compared to others. Maybe in those instances it was for larger clients with different needs... I don't know these devices are a little outside my expertise :)
 Our building is pretty high end and I'd like our networking capabilities we offer to tenants to reflect that as well. Is Sonicwall a good choice, or are there options that we should definitely consider over them?
 Thanks for any and all feedback and opinions.

 Since they have to login and out so many times, they do not log out of servers - they lock their sessions. This makes them vulnerable to a Mimikatz attack.

 I'm currently on Windows 10 with 16gb ram for the majority of my task force. The CAD users have 32gb.
 I recently made an in-place upgrade to W11 and saw that it use quite more ram. Idle, I sit around 6 to 8gb of ram consumed. This made me think I might have to upgrade everyone to 32gb (or 24? I feel this is an odd number).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wondering if anyone might have any tips on an issue I am having with a S2S VPN between a Cisco ASA and a WatchGuard. 
 I manage the WatchGuard. Remote side IT manages the Cisco ASA. 
 We've had Cisco TAC and WatchGuard Support involved extensively and they can't figure it out. Initially they thought it was a stuck SA instance, but remote Network Admin has checked that this time around and are not seeing anything like that. 
 We have a total of 6 active tunnels, 5 out of the 6 are working flawlessly and are stable. The 6th one, the WatchGuard will SEND from my end, but does not receive anything back from the ASA. 
 I've been through my config a dozen times and cannot find anything that would be preventing return traffic. To me, it feels like the ASA might have a broken return route back to the WatchGuard's network on that specific subnet. 
 I am aware of the reputation WatchGuard has in this subreddit. Replacing the WatchGuard is not an option and I really think WatchGuard has made some stellar improvements over the last 5 years or so and are solid UTM Appliances. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 So I unlinked the GPO from the OU and linked it to the nested OUs. All the nested OUs got it after a GPForce. But after unlinking from the initial OU, it is still applying to the kiosk OU. 
 There isn't a Disabled for this particular setting, so I don't know how to apply an OU that will overwrite the lockout. 
 Anyone know how to clear out a policy that has been removed if there isn't a way to apply a "Disabled" policy. Or would setting it to lock at 0 seconds mean it never auto-locks?

 I am doing research into starting my own ISP to resell wholesale fibre products. 
 I am in the planning stage at the moment however I have noticed that to become a BT Wholesale Customer I need an OFCOM RID number, however in order to get a RID number I need to show an agreement with a PECN (i.e. in this case BT). 
 My background is more sales and marketing and I have never done this before. I am in effect looking (initially) to "white label" the BT product which I believe is possible. 
 Any guidance on this or consultants who can help are welcome :)

As a mid-market MSP the only thing we run on-prem in a container is a DNS filtering service. Across our entire stack and customer base I cannot find another application for containers. Yet obviously there's lots of talk about this being the future for a lot of applications.
 So my question is anyone running containerised workloads (Docker, Kubernetes, and the sort) on their on-prem infrastructure? If so what kind of things are you using containers to accomplish? Did you write applications in-house that you now host or did a vendor/ISV provide them this way?

But most of the fleet is a mixture of w7 and w10 (enterprise). As well as the obligatory smattering of Linux devices here and there (mostly RHEL based). 
 The environment is also an 'offline' environment, generally with no direct or proxy Internet access (though I could configure a proxy if absolutely needed to) I'm looking to start tidying up the fleet of...shit. and I've never actually been the one to stand up config tools like SCCM/configmgr, Ansible, Puppet etc. 
 I don't really like the idea of SCCM due to cost the relatively small environment. So am considering tools like Ansible, Chef and Powershell DSC. 
 I like the idea of PowershellDSC as most client endpoints already have the powershell required as well as the native powershell management. And the environment is primarily Windows.
 But it doesn't seem to be used my most people over other config tools.
 Ansible on the other hand seems to be almost the defacto option and is better supported in the community. 
 I'm generally hoping for any feedback or opinions of the two options if anybody has experience of both?
 Another option could be Ansible for POSIX/*nix and DSC for Windows. But this seems like overkill

 I work in an organisation of around 7000 people with around 200 people in the IT department. I'm tasked with improving/sign-off on our naming standards, so far we have (see picture):
 low level account: john.smith@contoso.com
 Active directory privileged accounts using RBAC:
 T0a-smit001 (domain controller and tier 0 assetts)
 T1a-smit001 (Tier 1 assets such as application servers)
 T2a-smit001 (Tier2 assets such as laptops) 
 O365 admins: [jsmith@contoso.com](mailto:jsmith@contoso.com) (non synced account)
 Azure AD infrastructure, 2nd tenancy: [john.smith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:john.smith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com) (non synced account)
 We have more cloud environments coming along... 
 The question I have is what's the best way to manage the naming standard?
 Ideally I want something that's easy to see purpose at a glance, without screaming administrator.
 I'm also getting pushback from people saying they have too many accounts\passwords to remember.
 Also, do you differentiate the account name for things such as contractors and 3rd parties?
 Advice appreciated.

 It looks like the company that hosts our DNS records has gone bust. Our site and DNS records are available, but all the services for getting into our domain are unavailable (although the host site is still up) along with their telephone number and any ability to log tickets. We have tried looking online for options andcan see a number of comments on sites saying they appear to have ceased trading. Looking at Companies House (register of UK companies) they are overdue and it looks like they may actually have gone under.
 My question is what do we do now? The records are still avaialable and working but we need to get them migrated to a service that we can trust and make changes to. We can't get through to the host to open a request to do this though. I was thinking of reaching out to ICANN as this is a .com domain but I am unsure if there are any other options available to us here.
 Has anyone gone through this before that can give help/assistance on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started working at a manufacturing facility about 5 months ago as a system administrator (or, that's what the position practically is). They basically brought me in to get their systems upgraded, propose projects for development of their infrastructure, and conduct maintenance along with upgrades of software (along with helpdesk).
 There is a database (SQL Server) that is used for collecting sales information for customers. One of the upgrades I am going to be doing is upgrading the version of SQL Server being used along with the Windows Server version being used due to EOL of the server versions.
 Originally, I was going to be conducting the regular maintenance plan of getting software upgraded to latest versions along with some hardware upgrades.
 However, after analyzing the data in the database, I noticed issues that exist within the data itself, including redundancies, inconsistent data, and other issues with improperly built databases. My understanding is this is a database they've been using for years. Based on my experience so far, there have been issues they've had to deal with for a bit because of how the system is set up.
 Something I've been doing is looking at how their database is set up and recreating it using the database normalization techniques to reduce the issues we've been having (on a separate server of course). Along with this, I developed a web based application as a way to interact with this database. 
 I presented my ideas to my supervisor regarding my work and showed what it's capable of. He seemed really interested in it and is going to be meeting with me to discuss it further.
 I've heard the horror stories of lower employees having their work stolen or credit taken by their supervisors. Should I be concerned about this? Part of me wants to go beyond expectations in this role, but I've been told to not do so by others. Should I stick with doing regular upgrades in my role?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Morning everyone!
 We’re looking for implementing an Asset Management solution soon. We’re a medium size software company and all our devices are managed by an MDM so until now we haven’t felt the need for a dedicated asset management solution. However, with the growing number of assets and additional controls expected from the accounting team, we’re now looking for a good cloud solution.
 With so many options and due to the fact that providers adopt different pricing models (some charge by asset, some per user, others per site) and also don’t publish pricing on their websites, I was wondering if you guys could help me with some basic info about the solution you are using:
 - Provider:
 - Your organization size:
 - Price:
 I really appreciate any help. Thanks in advance and have a great weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 we have a fair number of people departing in a few months (education environment) and so we'll be disabling their AAD/Microsoft 365 accounts soon. I've been asked if it's possible to export all data (Onedrive for business/Outlook/Teams messages/Sharepoint Online sites etc.) for some of these users, in case they want to access it in the future.
 As I've stated, since this is an education environment, none of these users had access to any data that would be considered confidential, secure, or anything like that. From what it looks like, there's no way to export this data, neither from their end, nor from the admin center. I did find something about using eDiscovery to do it, but we don't want to use additional licenses or software to do any of this, especially since this won't affect our operations at all. If need be, I'll just tell the users to export their messages and download all their files manually, but seeing as many of them have upwards of 50 or even 100 Sharepoint sites (mainly due to MS Teams, but also manually created groups), I can't imagine this will be wildly popular.
 Ideally, we'd like to know of a way for the users to be able to export their data by themselves, but I imagine that probably doesn't exist, so is there a way to do it from my end without requiring a ton of manual work?
 Thanks in advance for any help.

It's a similar role on paper but the environment, architecture, procedures and policies are very different. I'm having to refamiliarise myself with some basic skills and knowledge that I was educated on during uni but never had to apply in my previous role and also learning 100% new stuff which I feel like I probably should have already known? I feel like I'm pretty slow with the tasks I have been assigned and I'm feeling pretty dumb and useless. 
 My previous job was fresh out of uni so I don't know what it's like to start as a 'skilled professional' at a new company. Is it normal to feel like a fish out of water when you start with a new company doing a similar role or am I just an imposter that got lucky?

 I have a windows computer that perfectly receives it's address from a windows DHCP server in our network. 
 When booting into a Linux OS with a live bootcd (USB) like Ubuntu, Debian, EndeavourOS, ... it all works perfectly and i receive the same IP from our DHCP server. 
 However, on the same computer i tried installing Arch Linux and i booted off the install medium like a normal Live CD but i never get any ip address.
 Arch sees the network card and indicates the interface is up but there is never a response from our DHCP server itself for this OS.
 MAC address is correctly detected and is correct in the DHCP server as well, that never changed.
 The following link shows you the DHCP request for Arch linux and EndeavourOS (Based on Arch).

 Does anyone know why this happens and what i can do about it to solve this ?

 I'm working on deploying Hybrid Join for our windows computers in order to reduce the amount of separate logins users have to do for teams, onedrive, M365 services in browser etc. So far this seems promising.
 I'm searching for a way to find information about the tokens available within a session.
 For now, all I have is the "SSO State" information listed with dsregcmd /status. One thing I noticed is that the AzureAdPrtExpiryTime changes when you modify the Prt e.g. by adding and MFA claim.
 Could I get detailed information about which claims and accesses a user has at a given moment, either on the client or in the AAD console? This way I could performe detailed troubleshooting in the event of an unexpected login request.

 This will of course not solve the issue, but some users do not know... and some do not really care. So it would at least help and inform the users.
 Is it possible for an administrator to submit a custom status message for a group of people in Teams? We would like to have the ability from the administrators perpective to change this message for all helpdesk users at once.

 We recently got 30 users joining our organization and we want to enroll them in Intune / Autopilot. Our first step is upgrading their W11 home edition to pro so that we can apply the Windows 10/11 Enterprise E5 license and enroll them.
 ​
 We have contacted our Microsoft partner we currently get our licenses from and they quote 180 euro for a W11 pro license, retail pricing is 150 euro and the grey market (CD-keys, G2A, etc) is 15 euro. I have read that Microsoft volume licensing is an option but we don't have access to that.
 The grey market option is attractive however I am worried that the keys might get deactivated in the future.
 Which option would be the best to upgrade 30 users from W11 home to pro?

 we have a pretty weird problem with Exchange/Outlook. 
 Scenario: We are an international company (let's call it contoso) with about 1800 employees spread over several countries in Europe. We have 1 domain and no domain trusts. Now we (contoso) have bought a company in Spain and this company should be integrated into our system. 
 Our infrastructure:
 - 2 physical Exchange Servers 2019 - which are up to date.
 - 2 virtual Exchange Server 2019 - which are also up to date
 - A Sophos SG Firewall - with a WAF configured for our exchange servers after best practice
 - Multible Domain Controllers
 - Office 2016
 Let me know if you need to know more about our infrastructure.
 What happened so far:
 - we bought the domain contoso-spain.com
 - we have created the domain autodiscover.co…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A thought struck me the other day as I was doing some housekeeping in our AD: How do people go about cleaning up and/or keeping their AD's under control over the years?
 The backdrop for this question is that our AD is, when you go way back, originally from 2001. As such it's seen its fair share of server-versions all the way up from WinSrv2000, and I'm still finding remnants of such ever now and then in the form of old built-in accounts, various groups and even the odd dead server or two that hasn't been properly removed from the domain.
 How do people deal with this? Basically set up a new domain within the same forest and move what you want/need over, or do you spin up an entirely new forest with a new domain and then migrate things?

 I work for a small start up that is using a Synology for file storage. 5 users connecting from all over the world and having access to different folders on the NAS. Everything works fine and everyone is happy, but me. There are around 5TB of data on that Synology. I need an affordable "Synology in the cloud". Where I can set users and access levels and have the data securely stored in the cloud. I also prefer a cloud in Europe - even better Germany - (privacy concerns) . What is the best practice for larger companies? I am very low on budget. I want to offer a solution that I feel safer with. (If the NAS fails - no one has access to data for several days)
 Thanks a lot guys

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past March our company entered a contract with a provider that provides us with Microsoft E3 licenses. Along with this came some professional services that helped us finish an initial Intune rollout. 
 On call 4of6 with our rep, I casually asked about the impact of a domain loss and name change on our tenant. I fully expected this to be a softball (I was hired on as a level one guy), and that my VP or anyone in our C suite would have posed this question at the beginning of our contract. 
 My rep paused for a moment, knowing our situation with Intune, our current DC, etc. He basically said we might as well not even finish this call, and mentioned how little time we have. My heart sunk.
 Since starting at my company I have been trying to get us onto a more modern platform, one that is easier overall for our users.
 With all that being said, doing double MS e3 licenses for 7 months is a non starter for our leadership. 
 Problem: we have ~650 PCs on old DC, most of which are remote and our VPN solution is a) sophos ssl b) not widely used
 My proposed plan: New DC: All new/current gen pcs are enrolled We redistribute devices on new domain Users continue to use old e3 resources on devices (office licenses) until we are ready to roll out name change and new tenant
 We have to be out of using our old name and tenant Jan 1
 My question: is there any easier way than this?
 Just about anything is on the table as long as I can tangibly point to a labor savings, and make it as easy on our users as possible. We can probably even talk about switching back to o365 and use those savings for some other solution.
 Thanks for taking the time to help a bit with this

 Here is how the subnets are being defined in access-list.
 #show run access-list VPN-SplitTunnel
 access-list VPN-SplitTunnel standard permit 10.36.41.0 255.255.255.0
 access-list VPN-SplitTunnel standard permit 10.101.0.0 255.255.255.0 
 The problem is after a user connects to the VPN, the new route does not show up in Windows route table.
 Where else do I need to add a route, so the users can receive the route.

 I checked and sure enough, our ERP was down. I panicked and started troubleshooting. The server was up and running, and the network was fine. I didn't know what else to do, so I blamed our vendor. I sent them a WhatsApp message: "Hey, what did you guys do? We can't access our ERP." They replied, "We didn't do anything."
 I was at a loss. I continued troubleshooting, but people were starting to get angry and impatient. I remembered that our domain had expired on May 28, 2023, and today was June 2. The domain provider had auto-renewal enabled, but it was attached to one of our directors' credit cards. I called him, but he was still asleep. After 16 minutes of trying to wake him up, he finally renewed the domain. He mentioned that he forgot to change the card detail. 
 I waited patiently for the domain to come back up. My phone could access the ERP, but my laptop still couldn't. I was about to start troubleshooting again when one of my managers said, "Have you tried restarting DNS?" I did, and it worked! Everyone was happy, and we hugged and celebrated.
 Just to share you my little achievement on Friyay morning

 For example: - The audit logs or sign in logs for all users in azure active directory. 
  
SharePoint auditing as well like document editing, deletion, etc
 
Firewall changes, logons, etc
 
any changes made in Salesforce
 
We also have other applications that we may be able to work with vendors or their API that we would like events logged

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically what the title says. I've had days where I got about zero sleep the previous night, for one reason or another, and I know that I'm not going to be a very useful human approximation at work. I've debated calling in and using a sick day, but I've refrained from doing so for two reasons:
 1) It wouldn't help me feel any better. When morning rolls around, that's it. I can't nap during the day without completely spoiling sleep the next night unless I'm actually sick. I'm not going to be able to do anything, so I may as well feel miserable and get paid instead of feeling miserable for free.
 2) We've got a small team, and I wouldn't want to let them down. I really like my compatriots, and if I'm out then my share of the work gets dropped square in their laps. If I can grab that phone call from the capo di tutti capi, that lets everyone else keep their concentration on what's important.
 I know that these sound contradictory, but it's a matter of taking the smaller tasks that don't require as much brainpower - stuff I've done a hundred times and is mostly muscle memory at this point - and either passing the challenging stuff off or sending bland updates that extend my deadlines.
 Basically, I'm asking for advice/anecdotes/etc. Thank you.

 And I found that all users who are having trouble are using Comcast as the ISP. 
 I did flushdns, delete cache, open with a different browser, modem/computer reset. but it didn't work. 
 When I reached out to the Comcast customer service, they only talked about Modem Status. 
 Any Ideas ?

 First 'proper(?)' job in IT, was working for a UK Telecoms company as Customer Service for many years before this role I took late last year.
 The role is IT Service Delivery Administrator. In case that flags anything up for anyone, I know of ITIL, not studied it myself but my manager is going to put me up for it as our new HoIT is keen on adopting a structure pointed more to ITIL than it currently is. 
 So currently, some of my roles and responsibilities include (but not limited to):
 Managing the provision and return of equipment to staff. It's more managing the tickets and just checking with the MSP like "hey, we all good for next week's star…]]></summary>

Current equipment per location: EdgeRouter 4, UniFi Switch 24 (non-PoE), single UniFi NanoHD AP, 5G failover router, ~4-10 desktops, ~4-10 VoIP handsets, ~2-3 network printers, ~15-20 WiFi devices, camera NVR, traffic counter, digital signage, credit card machine.
 Current Specs: Internet varies from 200Mbps to 1Gbps (max) symmetrical fiber, 6 VLANs, 2 WiFi networks, port isolation. Locations are completely independent -- no interconnection between locations, no VPNs, no internal file shares, etc). No servers -- all hosted services and applications. No printing over WiFi. Short throw for AP's -- long range not needed but WiFi speed is a priority. ~6-12 PoE capable devices: VoIP handsets, WiFi AP, traffic counter. Router cloud management - UISP via Ubiquiti (free). Switch/AP cloud management - UniFi controller via HostiFi ($50/mo).
 Current equipment has been pretty reliable overall. Never had a router go bad. Occasionally an AP/switch will disconnect from the controller and will have to be re-added via SSH.
 Would like to get a next gen firewall, PoE switch and WiFi 6 for each location, all cloud managed. Open to cloud firewall-as-a-service but don't know much about them. Stick with Ubiquiti or not? What products/stack would you recommend?
 Have looked at Calyptix AccessEnforcer, Fortinet, and am intrigued by Firewalla Gold (bought a demo unit but haven't plugged it in); Meraki Go line looks interesting. Open to suggestions.

 I am working on redesigning the network layout in the local government building where I work. We currently have 3 network closets, the Basement and most of the first floor go to the IT office, The Tax office has its own network closet with a cat5e connection back to the IT office, and the 2nd floor has one also with a cat5e connection back to the IT office.
 I want to make a change and have 4 network closets with fiber links all back to the IT office
 finance (Basement)
 1st floor
 Tax
 2nd floor
 My question is what would be the benefit of having a fiber switch in the IT office connecting all the switches together VR just connecting the switches' SFP ports 
 Switches I will be using.
 JetStream 28-Port Gigabit Smart Switch with 24-Port PoE+ (port amount may very) 
 Fiber Switch
 TP-Link JetStream TL-SX3008F V1 - switch - 8 ports - managed

 Thank you for your insight

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I entered the technology field in 2020, working as a dev intern. I've always had a passion for computers, networks, and programming, and shortly after, I started working with DevOps. Since last year, I have been working as an AppSec Engineer.
 Although I enjoy the technical aspect, I see it more as a hobby. Honestly, I have never felt completely satisfied working in this area, and I have always aspired to move into a management or consulting role once I gained more experience.
 I enjoy working with people and I am quite sociable. I hold certifications such as CCNA, Security+, and CySA+. So my question is: am I still too inexperienced to transition into pre-sales?
 I often read that this role requires a lot of technical knowledge, but when would be the ideal time to make the change?
 TL;DR: I have 3 years of experience in tech (1 year as a developer intern and 1 year in cybersecurity). I am not satisfied with the technical work and want to transition into pre-sales. Do I still lack enough experience, or is it possible?

 Has anyone had any experience with building IPSec tunnels on Palo Alto firewalls and then trying to send multicast traffic through them? Specifically I am talking about the Speakerbus appliance used in the securities/stock trading industry. We are having the absolute worst time where nothing we try works. We've tried GRE over IPSec, changing MTUs, convert rules to Any/Any, reviewing logs but nothing seems to be giving us a clue as to where traffic is being dropped. 
 Could definitely use some help/advice.

 I've recently acquired a couple of AHA374b GZIP accelerators for my personal servers. These cards were released a while back by Comtech's AHA Products Group and boasted impressive compression and decompression speeds.I was pretty excited about the potential they could bring to my setup.
 Unfortunately, these cards have reached their end-of-life/end-of-service status and Comtech is unable/unwilling to provide any access to the related software and drivers.I'm in need of:
  
Linux, Windows, and Open Solaris reference drivers with source code
 Drivers and Plug-ins for Apache Web Servers
  
I was wondering if any of you had experience with these accelerators and might have these resources archived or know where to find them. I understand this is a long shot, but any information or assistance would be greatly appreciated.
 Also, if you've used these accelerators or something similar before, I'd love to hear about your experiences – the good, the bad, and the ugly!
 Thanks in advance!

 As of right now, the Samsung Book3 Pro looks like the biggest bang for the buck. For about the same price as 11th and 12th gen laptops from Lenovo and Dell, I can get a 13th gen EVO laptop from Samsung with a better screen and webcam (they'll be using webcam quite a bit).
 I will say, I do personally own a Book3 for home use and really like it but it does come with a ton of Samsung bloat. But, that's nothing a reimaging can't fix.

 I might be late to the 100G train but here I am. I have a NAS shipping with 100G Aruba HPE 100Gb QSFP28 MPO SR4 100m Transceiver SKU# 845966-B21
 From my research this is has an MPO-12 connector. 
 For the switch side, I had purchased AMQ28-SR4-M1 transceivers (10Gtek, I already have good experience with their 10G model) which apparently have an MPO-8 connector.
 Following further research, I found out that MPO-12 has 4 fibers in the middle that aren't used, thus only 8 fibers are needed.
 My obvious question is, do these 2 transceivers work together? What type of cable is needed?

 Kind of embarrassing but anyway... why spam?
 Info:
  
This is the first time I sent an email to the specific person's email address (maybe attachment and first time sending flagged it, or my wording?)
 I have DKIM, SPF, and DMARC active. my (self hosted email) uses MailGun for outgoing mail. 
 I was curious if it may have went to spam possibly when I didn't hear back for a few days, but I get DMARC reports daily and double checked the report on this message, all passed.
  
dmarc - https://imgur.com/aLUuKxp
 I never had any issues with MailGun's rotating sending IP addresses (in dmarc report). Sent other emails recently to new addresses with attachments and they replied no problem. The only thing I can think of is maybe his I.T. admin has Outlook spam settings set ridiculously strict?
 I set up mail open/click tracking, which may help a a little (assuming receivers don't have images blocked by default), but still curious why this may have happened.
 Thanks and I appreciate any ideas you share

 As it's on an ancient environment the people who know about it have long gone so we're doing a bit of homework first and we need to determine what's actually using the DCs to work out what the risk is.
 I'm not overly concerned about the actual domain authentication itself as that'll generally just work itself out, I'm mainly concerned about LDAP and DNS - is there anything else i'm overlooking here?
 I can turn on the LDAP event logging to identity anything doing LDAP queries, not so sure about capturing DNS queries though...the Windows stuff will be fine, it's weird stuff like Wireless Access Points and other appliances i'm concerned about.
 Any other stuff i should be on the lookout for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have an HPE msa 2050 sas on which I have configured a sas connection with 3 hosts. Connections in the host tab showed up automatically. I connected the machines one by one (first the first port from controller A to the first host, port configuration on the device, then the first port from controller B to the first host, port configuration on the device, and then the next server). Connections look fine. From these hosts, I created a FOC group on the hpe msa 2050 and mapped the drives to this group. Then I set up a cluster failover on Windows Hyper-V 2019. Cluster passed the verification without errors, disks from the array connected without a problem, migration between machines works fine, but one thing worries me, when I run the get-initiatorport command in powershell on node 1 and node 3, it shows me nothing, while on node 2 it shows me all connections. It seems to me that on each server should be visible two connections and not all on one host. 
 Can someone confirm to me if the configuration on HPE is good or has anyone encountered something like this and is it normal?

 purchase new license
  
My plan is to create a group and assign the license to the group in bulk. then once successful, remove the existing license. However, i understand that to avoid service interruptions, removal and assignment of license should be done on one command. Will i be running into some issue if i add first and remove license later?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team is currently trying to roll out passwordless MFA but are having issues with some users trying to enable phone sign-in inside the Microsoft Authenticator app. For some users, it works like a dream straight off the bat. For others though it is a real pain in the arse.
 We are going to the security info page to add an authentication method (Microsoft authenticator app). Once added we then enable passwordless phone sign-in. The app displays a two-digit number which is entered in and then the phone is registered. The app shows that passwordless sign-in is enabled. However, when a user tries to sign in for the first time, they receive a message stating 'something has gone wrong on our side'. 
 Phone sign-in is then disabled and the user needs to re-enable phone sign-in to try again but this process seems to repeat after every login attempt, and we are unable to see why in the sign-in logs. 
 Users have either a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license or a Microsoft 365 Business Standard + Azure Active Directory Premium P1 License. They are also put into an MFA enablement group which is linked to a CAP. As I stated at the beginning some users it works like a dream, with no obvious differences in user setup. I would appreciate any insight you may have.

 So i attempted to use robocopy and a few others which all seem to fail and have the same issue. File path lengths and names.
 System has about 30 shares on it with stupid long paths, all of these programs tell me it cant copy because of length, there does not look like a way around this like there is with newer os version. 
 Can anyone advise a way around this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 im facing a really strange behavior with Server 2022 and RDP connections.
 Im running on VMWare ESXi 7.0 U2 with Server 2022 Datacenter. The problem occurs randomly on the servers and can be mostly forced by decreasing the hardware of the server to the minimum.
 Once i connect the following screen appears:

 checking the logs showing me a strange messages which not occour when the login succeeds. For eg:

 On several hosts i moreover faced the problem showing a disconnected user using 50% of the CPU. Once i kill the high CPU process the session is killed

 I appreciate any feedback or ideas to solve the issues. I already tried may things to rule out the problem such as deploying the image from a new clean iso, setting up the vm without domain join etc. Nothing yet helped me the locate the source of the issue.
 Regards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi gang,
 Apologies if this is not quite on topic. We have an internal application. One function of that application is generating PDF reports generated in Crystal Reports from data in an MSSQL database. This is a fully automated process, no interaction required.
 At present the function calls an SQL query, gets a list of reports to generate, then starts generating them one at a time before 'printing' them to a PDF file with the file name changed. This function currently utilises PDF995 which is slow and at times unreliable.
 This application (currently 32-bit written in VB4) is about to get an update to .NET and as part of this transition we want to move away from PDF995 and to something else we can 'print' a PDF to and specify the output file name as part of the process.
 Wondering if anyone here has a similar set up or knows of one, and can recommend a replacement software product. I'm open to anything be it subscription or a once-off, as long as it's regularly maintained and patched. TIA.

 iSCSI Boot
 Previous version: v3.1.80
 Current release: v3.1.80
 vs the current latest (at time of posting):
 Intel NIC Family Version 22.0.0 Firmware for X710, XXV710, and XL710 adapters - 10th Apr 2023
 https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-au/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=gxj5g
 iSCSI Boot
 Previous version: v3.1.80
 Current release: N/A
 Similarly for the latest "Intel NIC Family Version 22.0.0 Firmware for I350, I354, X520, and X550" also released 10th Apr 2023, where the previous version was v3.1.80 and current is N/A.
 I have firmware upgraded a "Intel(R) Ethernet 10G 4P X710/I350 rNDC" and a "Intel(R) Gigabit 4P I350-t Adapter" and confirm that the iSCSI Boot Option ROM disappeared after upgrading versions 20.5.0 >> 22.0.0 on both cards.
 I would imagine that iSCSI Boot is still supported perhaps, but how would one configure it and see settings? It's strange that there's no other mention of this at all in the release notes, other than the current release being "N/A".
 I am not currently using this functionality but have in the past. It's quite concerning when features just disappear with no explanation or justification!!

 So much for "never". What am I misunderstanding?

 I have been asked to assist with configuring some SPAN/RSPAN ports, and while I've done some basic SPAN configuration before, this project is quite large. The project covers 4 different facilities and quite large networks. We're still a little ways out from configuration, but I'm trying to do some homework so I'm more prepared when we get to configuration.
 The basic SPAN/RSPAN stuff seems fairly simple and straightforward, but I guess what I'm struggling to find is any documentation or literature on how to properly "place" SPAN and RSPAN ports/configuration. Mostly just some considerations or best practices for properly and efficiently designing a SPAN/RSPAN configuration. If anyone has any resources, please share!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I was hoping to get some opinions for a situation I can't seem to explain to some of our datacenter folks.
 I help implement and maintain our company's large private backbone/MPLS Network (let's call this out enterprise environment). We have two Datacenters utilizing Cisco ACI with 100G DCI between them. I'm not a data center guy, I'm a transport/radio guy.
 My task is to properly connect the MPLS environment to the two Datacenters. (Currently only commented via legacy DC equipment at one Datacenter only) this task wasnt completed by our senior in 3 years they had to do it and now that person is gone so I'm up.
 My thought is to connect to each DC via EBGP where my MPLS nodes are AS1 and the DC environments are AS2-5 (vPC pairs with separate AS numbers. Idk If that's good design, I didn't set it up and I don't know DC/ACI. I'd almost think each vPC pair would share an AS but have separate AS per DC.)
 Regardless, I'd set route policies to only allow DC to DC traffic to traverse the DCI and any user traffic. From DCA site to DC2 site would traverse the MPLS backbone.
 What general approach would you all take to this? I can provide more details if needed just let me know. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client that has their Office365 tools in a cloud instance with whitelisting. In order to whitelist IPs for our remote workers we have to split tunnel that MS Traffic in to exit our ISP for the whitelisting. 
 I'm using Palo Alto Global Protect and domain forwarding to accomplish this since there are regional IPs all over and VPN users all over. 
 I've basically added every domain found here: 
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams
 This seems to work for the whitelisting, I can see the traffic come in and out and it satisfies the client logon. However active Outlook and Teams sessions seem to go offline and can't show online anymore. I've gone through all sorts of logs and captures and so far I haven't been able to narrow down what and why this is happening. Nothing is getting blocked so the only thing I can think of so far is that there is some traffic that is getting missed (either not on the urls listed above, or direct IPs not getting DNS resolved) and splitting the traffic between two egress points causing the session issues. I'm trying to get something setup to where I can test and capture myself so I don't have to rely on client interactions but for now I thought I'd see if anyone has run into this issue. 
 I'm wondering if there are less domains I can split just for the login and leave all the others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! I hope there are still a few souls out there using WhatsUp Gold and might be able to help me out. Our WUG setup predates me, but since I've started we've begun to use NetBox as our source of truth. I'd like to setup a custom link so that when we view devices in NetBox, there's a link to the same device in WUG. My problem is that I can't really seem to find any consistent URL convention that will link to WUG; it seems like any links I try always go to the device I last logged into. Fwiw, we are running the 2021 edition. If anyone has any insight on where this is possible, I'd appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm playing around with my datacenter lab environment and stumbled upon a problem. Lets say my ISP gave me the IPs 192.0.2.10-192.0.2.20 in the 192.0.2.0/24 subnet (192.0.2.1 is the gateway).
 I want to route 192.0.2.11-192.0.2.20 over 192.0.2.10. Sadly I cannot add a route to the gateway statically or with something like bgp. 
 If I assign the IPs to the router, it doesn't forward the packets because they are (from the routers perspective) at the destination.
 If I use KeepaliveD to fill the ARP Cache of the Gateway and then remove the address from the interface it works until the cache gets cleared. 
 The Router runs VyOS (a Debian based Firewall / Router). 
 Any Ideas and Tips are welcome :)

I responded politely to advise that the former Administrator was no longer with the company in our IT department and that we were perfectly happy with our current adobe creative suite licensing in the portal and had no plans to add additional licenses or remove any currently allocated licenses. Thought that was the end of it, I periodically get this type of email from current or former vendors we do or have done business with in the past. I got a response with another email that had been CCed telling me to refer to the linked items for our licensing agreement and that this was not a sales email and the meeting and Audit are required.
 Apparently they haven't been doing audits the past seven years and now they're doing them again.
 We only have a small number of licensed users with the full adobe creative suite which is licensed through their portal user accounts, and each user has a single activated computer or laptop (marketing team members who do graphics or video editing).
 Has anyone been able to professionally and politely tell these guys to go pound sand?
 I didn't care much for the prickly response from them. Had they worded their original email different and told me it was time for a mandatory audit to begin with I would have responded accordingly. The times they requested for possible dates for the meeting fall during my vacation cruise and I handed it off to our IT director to schedule and have the meeting.
 I am pretty sure this isn't a scam, but it sure feels that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For energy saving reasons, we use Wake on Lan on our backup server so that it's only running when it needs to. This one and the main server are connected to a managed switch and both systems are in the same vlan. We have this setup at two different locations, only using different parts.
 At one of the locations, we discovered that network speed in that vlan slows down drastically when the backup server is shut down. After a lot more testing, we found out that this problem occurs with any NIC that is connected in 10Mb/s mode (tested 3 different systems, turned on and off, and manual 10Mb/s and 1000Mb/s mode, both full and half duplex, same problem every time). It's a KGS-1604 switch from KTI Networks. At the other location, using a TL-SG108E from TP-Link, we couldn't reproduce that behaviour.
 Sure, we could just replace the switch, but we're just some 10th graders from Germany, doing some tech stuff mostly for fun and getting some knowledge in IT along the way, therefore we don't exactly have a lot of budget. Most of our hardware was gifted to us or bought very cheaply from neighbours.
 But even if this is not fixable, we would like to know how this could even be?
 ​
 EDIT: Yeah time to say goodbye to that piece of shit, thanks for your advice guys, guess I learned a lesson today: NOT to buy THAT old hardware, no matter how cheap it is.

 We have been dealing with some issues regarding throughput on our 6e APs, leveraging the 6GHz spectrum. We are using a mix of Aruba 635 (2x2) and 655 (4x4) APs. Each AP offers 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz. We are also using the Cloud controller (Aruba Central, on v8.10.0.6_86193, tested with latest 8.10.x as well).
 We've configured a test SSID as we have begun deploying more 6e devices. We're seeing roughly half the throughput on the 6GHz as we see on the 5GHz radio with the same clients, running speed tests and iperf to local destinations (as well as Internet Speed Test reflecting the same). We see this throughput loss across 40MHz, 80MHz and 160MHz wide channels (it scales up as you'd expect with the increased widths, but we still see ~50% loss of throughput compared to 5GHz). …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old slingbox that tries to reach out to the internet for connection to download configuration data several times a minute. This configuration data will brick the slingbox so it is not wanted. 
 I see two solutions. One is to have a packet drop rule at the firewall to drop all these packets from the slingbox. I’ve tried this and it works but I hate the excessive logging. 
 The second solution is to set a dummy gateway in the slingbox gateway field. Unfortunately the device would not let me set 127.0.0.1 and I had to pick a unused ip on the lan. This works great. Nothing is logged on the firewall and I can access the device from the lan as I don’t need internet access to it. 
 So my question is from a network perspective. I’m assuming the dummy gateway on the slingbox to an ip not used on the lan will create additional arp request looking for it every time the slingbox tries to connect to internet for its bad config data via that dummy gateway.
 What would have the least network impact. The dummy gateway method or using the real firewall gateway and dropping all packets to internet?
 I’m assuming the dummy gateway method would free up any logging and load on the firewall but at the expense of broadcast additional arp request looking for the unused gateway ip. 
 So what’s the better solution?

 Is it possible to drop any incoming traffic to a certain IP that's fragmented in Mikrotik Router? We want to find out if the service will still work correctly or not if we dropped fragmentation traffics to said IP. I've tried to google this, but either it's not common practice or i'm not googling enough.
 My english is very limited so i might have used some uncommon terms there but i guess it's still understandable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the longest time at any job I’ve been at, the buck stopped with me. I was always the most knowledgeable on the systems and was able to quickly determine the issue and fix the problem or tell the help desk crew how to fix it. The company is growing, and while I am still the senior engineer for all of the servers and infrastructure, I am being told to start looping in other help desk people in on new systems. The thought is to push the mundane, low hanging tasks to the help desk and keep me doing the architecting and high level tasks. I know that it’s a good thing, for both myself and the members of the help desk, but I feel that I am losing control and won’t be able to be the knowledgeable one anymore.
 How have you gotten past this and been able to be at ease?

I run my clients through SpamTitan for email spam and phishing support. One of my clients is currently not receiving any Forgot Password emails or MFA code emails.

I've contacted the vendors and spoken with them *as they were sending the emails out*, and we have not received anything, nor have they shown up in logs. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Anyone have any ideas? I'm at a complete loss right now.

 I've been tasked with setting up some VLANs for a customer environment, and they use exclusively a digital phone system on their workstations instead of having physical phones on the desk. My general understanding is that in a setup with a physical phone you would send untagged traffic from the workstation and tag the voice traffic from the phone, and then they'll stay separated over the trunk link back to the switch, but I'm unsure how to implement this when it's just a single link between the workstation and switch - is it even possible? 
 Any tips would be greatly appreciated :)

 We'll be using it for some extra security, easier remote work etc for 80-100 users that work remotely. 
 So my question now is, how would I go forward with rolling out this update to my users? 
 I don't want them all to download the GCPW client themselves and install, neither do I want to do it for them manually, one by one. 
 We have no device management where we can roll out software. All our computers are just set up as a normal PC. 
 Would it be smart to write a powershell script that will download the GCPW client and install? 
 I pray that you, the sysgods have a solution, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The April 2023 Epyc 2nd gen revision guide has errata #1474:
 Description
 A core will fail to exit CC6 after about 1044 days after the last system reset. The time of failure may vary depending on the spread spectrum and REFCLK frequency.
 Potential Effect on System
 A core will hang.
 Suggested Workaround
 Either disable CC6 or reboot system before the projected time of failure.
 Fix Planned
 No fix planned
 Despite what they say, the problem actually manifests at 1042.5 days. The TSC ticks at 2800 MHz, and 2800 * 10**6 * 1042.5 days almost equals 0x380000000000000, which has too many zeros not to be a coincidence.
 Note that your server will almost definitely hang, requiring a physical (or IPMI) reboot, because no interrupts, including NMIs, can be delivered to the zombie cores: this means no scheduler, no IPIs, nothing will work.
 Either disable the CC6 (as you did with the Zen CPUs IIRC), or just reboot the damn thing, it's been three years already, you're missing out on a lot of security patches.
 Please read erratas before you start digging, it'll save you at least a day of debugging :(

From my understanding this is layer 7 stuff and a layer 2 switch would be oblivious to it. However, we're having issues after a server was moved, it's pingable, you can access port HTTPS which you get a "Page Forbidden", but that is the server replying at the end of the day. My argument is that the switches are configured properly, all servers are pingable, anything else would be at the application level, AKA on the server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The offline root CA and the online enterprise CA both are virtualized. The enterprise issuing CA will be running in AWS as an EC2.
 Since they will not be installed on a physical servers and not even on the local on premises network, we cannot use the somewhat low cost YubiHSM that you can plug into a physical USB port. AWS has a Cloud HSM that we may be able to use with a EC2, but it’s about $1300 per month.
 So, assuming using an HSM is not possible, what can you do to secure the private keys as much as is practically possible? Just lock away the offline root, limit the network connectivity to the enterprise CA to minimums needed to function and limit the accounts that have access to the online enterprise CA with permissions to view or export the private keys (local admin rights)?

Long story short, client recently enabled Azure AD sync and all of their PCs started asking for PIN set up upon sign in next morning. They don’t want to use PIN and only a password and I’m not sure where PIN requirement came from.
 I assumed it was due to Windows Hello for Business feature in Azure AD so I disabled it. Only 7 computers have been set up with a PIN and I’m trying to switch back to passwords.
 The computers are unmanaged in Azure. I have tried disabling all policies on affected machines that have anything to do with a password (Logon PIN, Windows Hello for Business). Also disabled “sign in options” registry key.
 After doing all that upon login certain users are still prompted for a PIN. I think it has something to do with Azure since they are Azure AD synced and my admin account is not so I never getting prompted but I just can’t find what’s enabled.
 Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I've run into an interesting/potentially alarming discovery at the office and I wanted some opinions. I'm primarily a SysAdmin but I do have my CCNA so I'm not entirely useless with networking. Our previous NetAdmin left ~2 years ago and we've (I've) been slowly uncovering everything that's been done here as necessary. To say it's over-complicated is an understatement (~100 subnets for a company of then 40 people, not including the /30s for OSPF PTP).
 Background: Our ISP provides us a /30 as well as a /27 that we specifically requested. The /30 subnet is terminated (is that the proper term?) on the ISP's hardware: they provided us x.x.x.124/30, the gateway is x.x.x.125 on the ISP hardware and our IP is x.x.x.126. The /27 is terminated in our hardware connected to their hardware: with block y.y.y.160/27 our hardware has y.y.y.161 and acts as the gateway. x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 are on separate VLANs routable via a VRF.
 The question: is there any benefit to using VRF in this situation? Or is there any benefit to the subnet being terminated by our hardware rather than the ISP's hardware?
 Side note/question: These IPs and the VRF are configured on a switch, not a router and/or firewall. I've further discovered that both x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 provide console access to the switch PUBLICLY. I've since closed that via access lists, but are there any other security concerns regarding this situation?
 Flaired this as routing but it could qualify as security. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We host internally a document management system and the creators of this system offer an externally hosted solution to allow us to share our documents to customers/3rd parties via a web portal (in loose terms).
 Now I've been tasked with configuring this (I've already voiced my concerns that exposing anything to internet is a bad idea but here we are). 
 The system sits inside our lan, behind a watchguard firewall, internally it's running IIS, I need a real world address to resolve to this internal website (i have a dns record setup pointing to our edge IP), I only want to allow one IP external address (or DNS) incoming to access this web server (hoping to make it as secure as possible).
 Would a simple 1 to 1 nat rule suffice, or is there a better smarter way of doing this?

 RANT WARNING: 
 We use Teamviewer for remote support as well as patch management and remote scripting. 
 Converting clients to the newly updated interface is longwinded when it works, but lots of our devices have failed to update with no explanation as to why. 
 The clients listed in the management console application only seem to show up half the time. And often assett lists fail to load anything at all. 
 Adding to all this the navigation is very unintuituive. It took me 5 minutes to find where to execute a script. It is done from the list of company devices and hidden under a drop down, not the remote scripting tab (why??????). 
 Congratulations TeamViewer, you have turned a mediocre patch management system into a terrible one. I'm open to change, but your UI is now utter garbage. 
 Thank god our contract is up for renewal in a few months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My whole career has been in IT. Started out repairing computers in 1991 and worked up to an IT Manager overseeing a large public organization’s infrastructure. I'm basically just a "crusty old Cisco guy" when you get right down to it. I'm likely older than a lot of folks on here (51) with about five years left before I can retire. I'm curious to know if anyone in my shoes has ever made the switch from IT to a "real" job? 
 We have an Energy Manager position opening up later this summer. My degree (from 1993) is in Electrical Engineering. I've worked on enough Facilities projects over the years that I could likely put together a good enough functional resume to at least sit an interview. Honestly though, as weird as this sounds, I'm not sure what people outside IT really do? The thought of not being responsible 24x7x365 for umpteen thousands of end-users seems a bit surreal. Not thanklessly fielding after-hours calls, giving up PTO because of unexpected issues/projects, or measuring success with anything other than network uptime all seem like foreign concepts to me. 
 If you've left IT after a substantial period, what were some of the things that surprised you? Would you share some of your experience with me on that transition? Thanks in advance to anyone that responds and hope everyone has a good day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This happened this morning, i came to work. Checked my e-mail to see a new question had appeared. Someone had gotten a phishing e-mail and asked if it was legit; spolier it wasnt. So i quickly respond to him: «No thats a phishing email, just report it.» Not thinking about it anymore, maybe 1 hour goes by or so and i recieve another e-mail, me not paying attention manage to open the attatchment from the previous mentioned e-mail. It took 1.1 ms to register what i had just done, it didnt even manage go load up before i managed to close it.
 Seeing as i have no idea what was contained in that file i had to go through the entire checklist
 Virus scan
 Reset passwords of other accounts which have been used on that computer/browser
 Check network logg
 Check registry logg
 Reinstall Windows.
 My biggest fear was that i was logged into Intune on an admin account if they could have hijacked the session.
 I sent the contents of the file to someone who could deobfuscate it:
 It just redirected you to a phishing website, no hidden malware.
 TLDR; Opened a phishing attachment and had to reset a lot of passwords and reinstall windows.
 Always pay attention, missclicks happen. And always delete emails containing phishing files/malware.

The problem now is, that as soon as we set a shared Mailbox to auto connect to User Mailboxes the Shared Mailbox connects to the Users Outlook Profile, but than starts requesting a Password even if the user has full access to the Shared Mailbox. If we turn off auto connect for that Shared MB and add it manually to the Users Outlook, there will be no PW request at all. We tried, cleaning old PW locally and also recreated the Outlook Profile without any luck. The same happens also with a non domain/non Intune Managed Private device. Anyone has an idea where that behavior is coming from? Thank you very much guys!

One way to fix is dsregcmd /forcerecovery requires you to sign in again, basically unjoins & rejoins the user [a leave and join in one step so you aren't left dangling outside the domain without an admin account]. 
 The simpler command dsregcmd /UpdateDevice made the PC name change propagate to Azure!

 We have some CAD software that's MAC Locked and also protected by a USB dongle. I know how to sort this in Hyper V but I am having zero luck getting USB to work. The Dell servers are all in Lockdown mode for IdRAC - Not sure if this disables USB. Additionally, I cant find a setting to allow USB passthru in Windows Admin Centre. I've tried connecting with Hyper-V manager directly to one of the nodes but this fails.
 Any Ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't gone too in-depth with proper foresight into getting our Active Directory into tip-top shape. Now we need to really revisit how we have structured our AD OUs in a much better way. From a top-level OU structure, we are planning to have the DC site location with the structure as -
 Site-Location:
 OU Level 1- Building/Office 
 OU Level 2 --Department
 OU Level 3 ---Users/Computers
 We have some challenges here and not sure if the above structure will work:
  
Some buildings/offices may have a mixture of different departments that exist in other buildings/offices in the same site.
 Some users may be in multiple departments, so should we create all department containers in all buildings/offices as a pre-step to avoid extra work in the future?
 Some "special category" computer group policies we have applied to specific department machines which should not apply to all departments, would it be wise to create OU Level 4 for these machines? Specific policies are for example: Exceptions to Windows Screen lock-out, Allowing phones to be tethered to CPUs, Allowing USB access. This would create the GPO mapping side to be a little more tedious for us. So trying to prevent as much work as possible here.
  
Any suggestions on proper structuring from AD Veterans would help. Thanks!

 I am in the process to learn MS Azure SC-300 Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator for my certificate and i was wondering:
 Almost everyone I know uses username + password + 2fa code at once OR username + password > 2fa code.
 Lets say a hacker tries to get in with username and password. Since the 2fa comes later, it is possible for him to know, if the password he brute forced is right or not...?
 Why dont organisations do username > 2fa code > password?
 So they wont know if the pw was right or not and 2fa code is changing all the time anyway?

 Let me explain better, we need to be able to dial into windows machines on our customer networks but they refuse to have a site to site VPN, client to site, team viewer, RDP etc… they want to have an in demand solution where we only access when they allow us to. Quick support isn’t an option as we cant control the device per se. Wouldn’t it be cool if we could do that natively?

 ​
 I have an strange issue i cant find much information about on the internet.
 I did a dhcp / print server migration a couple of days ago on 2 locations.
 Exported the dhcp settings with powershell and imported to new one.
 DHCP is working fine , and clients are getting IP:s from the new servers.
 The servers are authorized and i can see them in the list of authorized servers.
 After the migration i cant see any scopes anymore (this worked before migration) , only on one location (1 out of 6) and thats the head office dhcp server.
 Red "Stop sign" over the dhcp server and says "There are no items to show in this view".
 I can see the scopes locally on the server but not from my own computer with RSAT tools.
 ​
 I´ve tried running as different users / run as admin.
 Rebooted servers.
 Reauthorized DHCP servers.
 ​
 But still no luck. Anyone know what could cause this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am at the site were running OSPF over the trunk link would be preferred, because I'd like to utilize at least one more link for convenience and doing it over trunk would make it much more cost-effective. The only thing I can think of is that it could require increasing of MTU limit on both ends. But is there something more to it that could make it an unpreferable choice? Especially from security perspective.

 The CALs are purchased based on the number of users and devices accessing your servers regardless of having 2 servers of the same OS or older or 2,000 servers, correct?
 Then server OS licenses are based on the number of physical or virtual CPU cores in each server with a minimum of 8 per server? However, if you are running Windows Server Datacenter, you can buy Datacenter server licenses based on the number of physical cores on the host machines and that covers an unlimited number of virtual guest copies of the OS running on the hardware?

 We recently had ATT Mark us as spammers because our webapp is sending ~280k emails a month that are mostly just "Hey, Your Order Has Been Shipped" or "You requested to Reset Your PW - Here are instructions" type stuff. Standard eCommerce Webapp emails. 
 My question is this -- would you allow a CEO to send to a standard contact group a few times a year... and then create the contact group and let them go crazy? Are there restrictions you would put on this? Would you insist it go through a marketing email campaign manager due to risk of reputational damage?

 I'm the solo IT guy at my company and while I have a year of experience in this environment, have my A+ and am currently studying for my Network+, and I do the work of network admin, help desk, IT manager etc, I know that I am not nearly experienced enough to know what a healthy IT environment looks like or how to correctly implement it. I inherited this system with no documentation, no backups, all the classics on here.
 I was fortunate to talk to some members of another institution similar to mine just up the road, and they offered for me to visit their site for a bird's eye view of how they run things (thank God they took pity on me). I'm trying to make a list of things to ask and not ask - I don't want to burn bridges by being invasive and I don't want to walk over and say 'teach me everything', but at the same time I want to make sure I can benefit from this experience.
 If you had the chance to tour another IT environment and learn from it, what would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had the good fortune to get interviewed by a few recruiters over the past few months and the ones who didn't push me through all said the same thing. I don't have experience working on a team this big. Which really sucks and shouldn't really be a factor. I have 11 years of IT/sysadmin and web dev experience.
 I've been a jack-of-all-trade type for about 9 years between two companies and my consulting on the side. I also have sales b2b experience for 4 of those years. I know how to pick up systems and processes really quickly and easily. I am currently teaching myself full stack development and cybersecurity concepts (since I want the CISSP by the end of the year). I have always been employed and am a good worker, yet these recruiters treat me like some unemployable person.
 The problem seems to be that I don't have a structured IT career progression and a lot of it is self taught. Mostly because I was the guy the incompetent managers hired to fix things. Yet somehow I am not getting this picture across to recruiters or they don't believe me when I say I work well with others. I know that there is some disconnect between my experience and what companies are looking for. I do believe it is the fact that I have never been in a company that was larger than 500 people. This seems to have hurt me in my job searches. Even though there was diversity, teamwork, irate end users and all that comes with any IT job.
 Is there any advice out there for a sysadmin who is looking to gain exposure to technologies at a large company? I am not dumb and I can handle sysadmin work, but why do the recruiters not want to hire you if you weren't in THAT specific industry? Using THEIR specific tech stack?
 Are they not understanding that the things I've done match their requirements (but on a smaller scale)?

 Does anyone with first hand experience either at the consumer of NaaS or the vendor mind sharing? 
 Is there still a role for a network engineer at a company that consumes NaaS? And if so, what does that look like?

Everything else is identical, even the email signatures. There was also about 10 other emails copied so at first glance it's not really noticeable. After reply this was followed up by we changed banks, plz see attached for new banking info and then accounting paid it...
 We use o365, mfa is enabled and we even do semi-annual training with knowbe4 to be aware of this type of stuff. Now IT is being asked to investigate but honestly there's not really much we can do from here. The spoofed domain was recently registered and all the mail records are setup correctly so it slipped by all the scanners. Email also had a warning in the body that we add to be cautious as this is coming from outside the company. 
 Now we are wondering how a scammer intercepted the communication and was able to phish it. We've seized everyone's laptops that were involved and locked their accounts. So far nothing suspicious, no message rules, no unknown logins, no malware. We are wondering if it's on the vendors end but even if it is I don't think you can really hold them responsible
 I guess this is just a warning to ensure your user base is well-informed about phishing. If anyone has any tips let me know. They are already trying to reverse the transfer but it's been weeks since it went through. They didn't even know until the legit vendor followed up a month later and said the balance was still unpaid. 
 Said vendor also isn't a small fry and is a multi-billion dollar global company. Crazy someone can register a domain 1 letter off.

 My supervisor is leaving. He was in a managerial role and did all the paperwork and reports and meetings. He covered me when I took trips, and was my backup when I needed to bounce ideas or troubleshooting around.
 I, the net and sys admin, do 95% of all IT related tasks, and we lost our low level techs over a year ago, but we positioned in a manor where I can pretty much run the place alone. It's not a lot of work.
 Their isn't enough work for two techs of my skill level IMHO, and the management stuff is signaling that the IT reports, etc of the managerial role can be scaled down. 
 So, idk what to recommend to the business, and quite frankly I'm stressed out. Can I run the place myself? Sure. Do I want to do that and never get a free thought to go on vacations unbothered, etc. No. But there isn't enough work for two techs. If I brought someone else on we would be twirling our thumbs and it would turn into a revolving door of techs I'm sure.
 What do I do here? Is an MSP an option? Do they help with windows servers, help desk, and Linux servers? I have zero experience dealing with them.
 Do I hire abother tech and we just shoot the shit most of the day? I'm beyond stressed over this, and considered polishing my resume myself but the company really needs me and I really like the people who run it, it would be hard for me to do that to them.

 Any information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Occasionally we have the need to transfer the contents of a user's Onedrive to a location on-prem. Reasons vary, so I won't go into all that. I'm wondering what options others have come up with for this? We have been accessing the user's files via the admin center and web interface, but it's just so clunky to do it this way when they have a large amount of stuff out there. The MS Sync method has given varying levels of success as well.
 I've seen third party tools that offer Onedrive cloud connectors like Filezilla and such, but they only give you access to the Onedrive of the person logging in. I've seen feature requests for these to add the ability to access the Onedrive's of others the admin has access to, but it looks like there is a technical issue to doing this?
 Does a good solution exist for admins to get at the contents of User's Onedrives without having to mess with the web interface download?

When connected to a Loadmaster and looking at the statistics, I am trying to understand what the Total Conns means. Is that just a connection for an individual service, port, user connection, etc? It is a total connection over 24 hours? The ask is because I do not know why some of my numbers are so high, when the system is a test system and not heavily utilized by more than a few people, however the total connections is over 2000.
 Seems Kemp questions are pretty vague here in this sub, but I am hoping for the best. If I should post this in another sub I can do so. Thank you in advance for any help.

Pretty easy to understand, but I’m stuck on one concept and the class materials are not explaining. So, the Physical Active Router handles ALL of the traffic, including ARP requests, which are first sent to whatever router the host is connected to. What if a host is physically connected (through the topology that might include some switches) to the router acting as Standby? The book/class doesn’t mention it, but is there a requirement that there be redundant L2 paths for hosts so they can potentially reach ALL routers participating in HSRP?

 I kind of want to take on a side project to leverage some Cisco API to identify potential bugs related to upcoming changes across a large array of platforms and IOS/NX/XR versions. So I guess this post is for one of two things.... has anyone done anything similar to deal with one-off bugs that would be hard to identify in a lab environment before changes, and 2.... is there a solid Cisco API that I could parse against a keyword or software function (eg: BGP, SNMP, etc) and a list of device types/versions to try and proactively identify these types of issues? I'll be using Python, but language/nuances don't matter too much as I know not everyone here is super familiar with code.... more looking for if anyone knows manual methods or data sources/api's they've leveraged in the past that I can put code to in order to make a web front end that does these checks for us prior to changes.
 Thanks for any info!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My apologies in advance if this is the wrong area for this kind of problem or if it's too simple.
 I'm an old dinosaur who used to set up office VPNs about 15 or 20 years ago. These were simple VPNs which allowed remote users to access their documents at their office.
 The method back then was to set up a vpn connector on the laptop, point it to the public IP, and set up forwarding for a couple of ports in the router. Then IIRC I'd set up permissions in their account on the server.
 I've been called upon to set up a VPN for someone, and it looks like things have changed remarkably. Whn I search in order to bone up, most returns are for commercial VPN companies who are focused on providing anonymity on the web.
 Has my method of creating simple VPNs become completely outdated? I assume that security issues and methods are very different nowadays.
 Are there any good resources out there to re-learn basic VPN principles and best practices? Perhaps as I've gotten older my search capabilities have dwindled, or else I'm so hopelessly out of the loop that I don't even know what to search for within the context of small office VPNs. If anyone can steer this old coot in the right direction I'd greatly appreciate it. Again, I apologize of this question is not appropriate for this group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying to apply Voice, Video, and some critical data QoS to out network. I've done the research on how to create a class-map, policy-map, and how to apply the policy-map to the interface. However, when I try to apply the policy-map, it is getting rejected with error message:
 "Invalid queuing class-map!!! Queuing actions supported only with dscp/cos/qos-group/precedence/exp based classification!!!"
 I've tried using both dscp and cos just as the message is saying, but the policy-map won't get applied to the interface.
 class-map match-any VIDEO
 match protocol rtp video
 match cos 5
 class-map match-any VOICE
 match protocol rtp audio
 match ip dscp default
 policy-map QOS-POLICY
 class VOICE
 priority level 1 percent 25
 class VIDEO
 priority level 2 percent 25
 This is the class-map and policy map that is currently configured. Our switch is Cisco Catalyst 9500-40x. Is there switches that can't accept certain QoS configurations? I've read that the interface supports certain QoS traffic and this is the result of the interface i'm trying too apply this to:
 TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 Model: C9500-40X
 Type: SFP-10GBase-LR
 Speed: 10000
 Duplex: full
 Trunk encap. type: 802.1Q
 Trunk mode: on,off,desirable,nonegotiate
 Channel: yes
 Broadcast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Unicast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Multicast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Flowcontrol: rx-(off,on,desired),tx-(none)
 Fast Start: yes
 QoS scheduling: rx-(not configurable on per port basis),
 tx-(2p6q3t)
 CoS rewrite: yes
 ToS rewrite: yes
 UDLD: yes
 Inline power: no
 SPAN: source/destination
 PortSecure: yes
 Dot1x: yes
 Breakout Support: not applicable
 Is the interface compatible for the QoS?

 Is there an easy way to reconfigure these so that every switch is the same? I know the commands to do so, but Will I lose ssh connection and have an unreachable switch if I delete all the vty lines and then configure new ones?
 I need to change the session timeouts on all the switches and its tough to push a config change out when all the vty lines are different.

 Now what the hell would that be? I don't know. According to Google- "The role exists to ensure that the company consistently delivers, and the customer consistently receives, excellent service and support."
 Sounds a lot like customer service rep to me.
 What is up with this trend of calling every role an engineer??? What's next the "Service Delivery Architect"? I get that it's supposedly used to distinguish expertise levels, but that can be done without calling everything an engineer (jr/sr, level 1,2,3, etc.). It's just dumb IMO. Just used to fluff job titles and give people over-inflated opinions of themselves, and also add to the bullshit and obscurity in the job market.
 Edit: Technically, my job title also has "engineer" in it... but alas, I'm not really an engineer. Configuring and deploying appliances/platforms isn't really engineering I don't think. One could make the argument that engineer's design and build things as the only requirement to be an engineer, but in that case most people would be a very "high level" abstraction of what an engineer used to be, using pre-made tools, or putting pre-constructed "pieces" together... whereas engineers create those tools, or new things out of the "lowest level" raw material/component... ie, concrete/mortar, pcb/transistor, software via your own packages/vanilla code... ya know

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, has anyone had any experience with getting DHCP snooping working on Dell OS10?
 I have a pair of S5232F-ON running OS10 10.5.5.3 configured as a VLT pair.
 The manual is pretty vague on DHCP snooping - it says all you have to do is configure "ip dhcp snooping trust" on the uplink that faces the DHCP server, and then enable "ip dhcp snooping" globally. I've tried this, and as soon as I turn on DHCP snooping globally, attached systems can't get DHCP any more. As soon as I turn off snooping, DHCP works again.
 Support say that as no bugs have been reported with DHCP snooping, it must be that I've misconfigured the switch. This is entirely possible but not very helpful!
 If anyone knows how to make it work for sure, I'd be very interested.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
 I am currently a Telecommunications technician at a data center and have been working on trying to move my career foreward. I think I am mostly looking for any ideas, tips and tricks, and/or a curriculum on how to best make the move into network engineering or a similar field. I love the trouble shooting part of my job but the long drives to my work place and the physical wear and tear on my body are starting to beat me down. I have an extremely strong knowledge on anything layer 1 and have been working on passing a JNCIA cert. However I feel that may be a waste of time. I am toying with the idea of reaching out to a recruiter and seeing what they could find me and see if any companies are willing to take on someone like me to train up. 
 I was originally a fiber splicer technician working ISP and OSP, until I got my current job. However I feel my current title is very undescriptive of what is expected of me. I work closely with our in house Cloud, Neteng, and syseng teams and have picked up small bits of knowledge along the way. I've attempted to move into the department but management of my department has a hard time working well with others and is seeming to be blocking me. I would love to get work that can be WFH at least part of the time as I now have a one year old and want to be around more than I currently am. ( I work 5 days most of the time, 10 hours with 4-5 hours of travel depending on traffic. ) Any and all advice would be welcome. Thank you all so much. 
 TLDR: Telecommunications technician with layer 1 experience looking to move into the Networking field. Looking for thoughts and opinions on how to make the move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I'm running Proxmox with one physical interface, eno1, and two virtual interfaces, vmbr0 and vmbr1. vmbr0 is bridged to eno1 for a few VMs/containers to sit directly on my LAN. vmbr1 is a private Proxmox LAN and is NAT'd through vmbr0 to access the internet. I have a web server on 10.1.0.5:443 and have a DNAT rule in iptables to achieve port forwarding:
 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.1.0.5:443 
 The problem is that when traffic comes in from the bridged devices, this rule ends up applying since it's coming in on vmbr0 and then getting forwarded out. How I can make this rule apply only to packets that originally come from eno1 or distinguish it in some other way? I'd prefer not to just put exceptions for each individual bridged IP. I'm still pretty new to iptables so any help or clarification for any misunderstandings I may be having is very appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am a solo sysadmin for roughly 60 users across two sites and I am in the process of migrating all workstations from MacOS to Windows. Due to budget constraints, our migration is slow. We have ~80 workstations and started replacing one every month in July of last year. The reason this is relevant is that we are going to have a mix of MacOS and Windows for a while and processes can't just be switched over.
 Here are a few questions that I have and any advice would be greatly appreciated:
  
Because the office is primarily Mac-based, domain administration tools (AD, GPO, etc.) have never really played a major role except for email (on-prem Exchange server). This gives me the perfect opportunity to rework the domain setup to my liking regarding policies and organization. How have you approached this in the past? 
 
Some of our users have only ever worked on a Mac so they would need training right from the basics on working with Windows. How have you handled user training on the new OS? Are there any good user guides out there that cover Windows 11 from the basics and would be easy to navigate for tech-illiterate users? 
 
Due to the sometimes huge process changes, I find that a lot of users will try to tweak the new processes to emulate their MacOS experience, often making their Windows experience a lot more complicated and increasing frustration. How have you helped users adopt new processes and help them see that the new processes, although different, are more efficient and will make it easier for them to do their job?
 
 I know this is a pretty lengthy post, but I really appreciate any responses to my above questions.

 We are testing conditional access MFA using the following policy: 
 Users: Specific group
 Cloud apps or actions: All cloud apps
 Conditions: All trusted locations (Our HQ)
 Grant: Require authentication strength: Custom strength
 Session: Sign-in frequency 30 days
 Session 2: persistent browser session
 The custom authentication strength is almost everything enabled except FIDO2, cert based auth, temp access pass (multi-use) and all of the single factor auth options. 
 This all works quite well for most of our users in the testgroup. However we do notice some bugs or issues.
 1 user needs to re-authenticate OneDrive every day. Sometimes in the middle of the day after a few hours of active use.
 Another user is seeing pop-ups in windows that the account in use has issues/ is broken.
 We also noticed that this user also needed to re-authenticate his workdevice, even though this is an Azure/ Intune joined device. 
 The question:
 Is there something in the authentication strenghts that we need to enable/ adjust?
 Or
 Are there any known issues with the conditional access grant 'require authentication strength'? 
 Before the switch to 'require authentication strenght' we used the origional: 'Require multifactor authentication' for our MFA tests. This worked fine and as excpected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks!
 Formerly in our company we had like 10 employees before I got here almost 2 years ago. Now we are 4 employees (including me). 
 The situation at the workplace
 I am focusing on everything IT-related. They have set up a domain network with 4 windows machines and one windows 2012 R2 server. The employees login through the domain meaning its dependent on the server to work. 
 - Every employee has access to the other employees computer (except for mine)
 As some of you know Windows Server 2012 R2 is about to reach its end of life and so does the software we run on it. 
 ​
 Suggestions needed
 Why even bother logging in through a domain at all? Why cant I just setup each computer individually with local accounts? Going with a server is just overkill and its just consuming alot of power (and is also getting very warm in my office). The software that the server is providing with the other users basically just needs a visible-over-network folder. Meaning I can just "share" a folder in the network with a smaller, not so hot running but modern computer running windows 10 and just share the folder with the other windows 10 machines. 
 I think the server solution for us is just too much work and pointless in our current situation. Are there any concerns about turning the logins of my employees into local accounts?
 I didnt know who to turn to and reading this reddit has helped and inspired me alot for my workplace and I really hope it fits with what the community is about

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I've been trying for some time to configure Windows 10/11 to work in kiosk mode while also running Docker service and containers in the background. Here are my considerations so far:
  
Containers in Docker Desktop on Windows 10/11 are user-specific, not system-wide.
 How can I run containers that I started on one account while configuring kiosk mode for another account?
 I generate kiosk configurations using Windows Configuration Designer from the Windows ADK package.
 Microsoft's documentation in this area is extensive, but it doesn't cover running background services or containers.
 Apart from Docker and containers, I want the kiosk to launch Windows Classic Apps by specifying the path to the executable file, which I have already tested.
 I don't want the Docker Desktop window to be accessible to the kiosk user.
  
Any additional recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a customer that uses windows 11 to access an L2TP vpn. The configuration worked up to about 10 days ago, now it does not work anymore. 
 The vpn is configured as split tunnel, so internet traffic stays out of the vpn.
 He connects to his wifi at home, then to the vpn, and after just a few minutes (or even just one minute) his internet connection dies. It seems to be connected but he cannot do anything on the internet and of course inside the vpn too.
 He connects to his wifi hotspot on his phone, same issue
 He connects to his home router via a network cable, everything is fine.
 So it seems that when he uses wifi and the vpn, his wifi somehow dies, traffic just stops.
 I have tried setting up a win11 PC the same way (he's VERY remote, so I'm not going to his home, I must solve this remotely) and my win11 PC has the same problem. 
 Googling "win 11 wifi l2tp vpn not working" or something similar gives no meaningful results, so I'm here asking if someone else is experiencing this issue.

 I am working on this old network infrastucture and I am trying to replace some 3Com 4500 with Ruckus ICX 7150-48P. While doing some tests I found out that if I connect this two models of switches together with a patch cord everything works fine, but if I try to use a fiber link, the status led one the port lights up only on one switch, the 3Com.
 I have tried every possible combination of SFP module, tried to configure the ports in many ways but nothing seems to work.
 I wanna ask if in your opinin it is possible that these switches are just not compatible because I have tried replacing both switches, one at the time, with various ones and always worked except in this one condidion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked with investigating the options for on-call alerting software for my company.
 We already use incident.io to manage any incidents themselves, and track metrics and trigger alerts with DataDog, both of which are integrated into our Slack workspace to send messages to a custom channel. But neither currently support sending out either SMS or phone call alerts to an on-call engineer (and we can't wait to see if they are building it). If everything else was A+ I would accept app/push notifications, but using the mobile phone network is first choice.
 The reason I bring up those existing systems is because a lot of tools out there (PagerDuty, BetterUptime etc) cover a lot of the same bases as well as the on-call alerting, so we'd be paying a fair chunk of change for features we have no intention of using. I saw a recent blog post about PagerDuty alternatives, but from my reading many of the listed products are covering the incident management portion (like incident.io), but missing the actual alerting via SMS or phone call (out of hours, when we can't expect engineers to be paying attention to the work Slack).
 This needs to be a SaaS solution, because we want to be able to alert in the case that our entire platform on which all our own stuff is hosted is having issues. Given that we're entirely in AWS currently it also shouldn't go down if AWS has issues.
 What products are other people using? Would you particularly recommend or warn against using it, or is it just 'good enough'? Is there anything out there that really focuses on the callout schedule and actually calling people out, rather than all the rest of the management and tooling around that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an HPE 2040 SAN that I replaced with an HPE 2060 earlier this year, and I was wondering what should I do with it.
 To give more context : I'm the sole IT in a 100 users company, basically manage everything, but I joined just one year ago and I have no history regarding this, I started as helpdesk and climbed my way so I don't exactly know best practices regarding this. 
 My initial idea was to unplug it and store it in a safe place so that I can reuse it if any disaster occurs, but I feel like it's a waste of resources. I could for instance make a complete test environment which I currently don't have (I only have test machines and systems for very specific things). 
 I may also try to use it as a lab, for instance to test new things (learning a bit more about Proxmox which I think may be enterprise-ready for some time in the future, already use it privately and would like to try on on high-end machines).
 Same thing happened with my previous ESX hosts, I basically unplugged them and stored them even though they are still perfectly functionning. I budgeted their replacement and didn't have enough rack space to keep them on, so I stored them safely. 
 Anyone care to give me general advices on what to do with them ?
 Thanks !

 Seeking the hive mind as i've exhausted most other options here.
 A users Excel always hangs for 5 - 10 seconds when closing, the file can be on OneDrive (Local), Network Share or even a blank workbook. It sounds pretty trivial but its actually very frustrating to work with.
 This is a new Windows 11 machine (4 months old), it's a pretty well spec'd workstation for office use.
 - The behaviour is not repeatable when starting excel in Safe Mode. 
 - The behaviour is repeatable with no Add Ins enabled.
 - The behaviour is not repeatable when using another user account on the PC (domain joined). 
 - Office is the latest version.
 - Tried many small online fixes (Disabling hardware acceleration etc etc).
 What else does Safe Mode disable that might be causing Excel to hang like this?
 I've yet to do a fresh install of office as i feel it probably wont make any difference.
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks

 I was under the assumption that my policy would have added my accounts in addition to any preexisting ones but I was obviously wrong.
 My issue is, I have other domains to roll this setting out to with applications I'm not fully aware of.
 Is there a way for me to query servers in my domains to find any servers that have this setting defined manually in gpedit as rsop.msc doesnt show the manually defined ones.

 I am currently examining the DDI market and would like to know about the existing standards and trends. Specifically, I am interested in cloud-based solutions or cloud-managed options available.Currently, our organization lacks an IPAM system, and DHCP and DNS functions are handled by the AD DCs. In addition to Infoblox, BlueCat, and EfficientIP, I am curious to know about other notable players in the market. (I would like to avoid Infoblox due to its high cost.)
 I am not looking for an overlay solution to manage DNS and DHCP on the AD DCs. Rather, I am interested in a separate solution that can remove the DNS and DHCP roles from the AD DCs entirely.
 Objective is to streamline infrastructure by separating the DHCP and DNS responsibilities from the AD DCs and consolidating them within a comprehensive DDI solution. Solution will be internal only, no public facing DNS, split-horizon, etc..
 EDIT: Looking for enterprise solution with vendor support, no DIY with Netbox and BIND/KEA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our organization is currently exploring the implementation of Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) to improve remote access for our employees. However, we have a mixed setup, with some resources hosted in the cloud (such as O365 and various Web SaaS apps) and others hosted on-premises.
 To provide some context, we currently utilize Azure AD with Business Premium License P2 for our authentication and access management. We have also adopted a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy, allowing employees to use their personal devices to access organizational resources.
 However, due to compliance requirements, employees are only allowed to access O365 applications if their device is registered with Intune and Conditional Access policies are applied.
 How can SASE help address our specific needs and challenges in this mixed setup? We are aware that SASE combines network and security capabilities into a unified cloud-based solution, but we are uncertain about its applicability to our situation.

 "I have noticed that not only SPF and DKIM, but DMARC record has been added to your domain's settings as well. Kindly note that Wix does not support DMARC records. There is a lot of overlap in the function of DMARC & DKIM, and the use of DKIM+SPF is more effective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening r/networking,
 We are looking at the possibility of jumping from one WLAN MSP who has been with us for a very long time to another, newer one. The older one has provided a decent quality of service but has been very expensive with respect to WLAN/LAN costs for clients in the building. The building I work at is a very large campus (over 700k sqr ft), and I am not in a position of leadership, but I'm being dragged along for observational purposes, opinions, etc. My supervisor is a finance person, and I am the only in-house IT Manager/Network Engineer person on site for these systems. I would love to bring it in-house and build out a department, as I feel it is silly to jump from one MSP, gut out all that past experience and knowledge of the building/know-how on dealing with clients, and going to a new one. I've been reading non-stop about design and management, but I was wondering if people had any advice on how to approach this, resources I should read up on, questions I should ask, etc. I won't lie, I'm nervous about this whole ordeal. Thank you.

 I'm not hitting bandwidth limits or anything. Its something between that software and s3. The instance and bucket are in the same region. I also tried using network drives from the destination host but something is off with the transfer to the host from aws, getting 2mbps max (using robocopy)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company is in the process of rolling out MS Teams to the organization. The direction is currently to deploy a MS Team to each department and then use the underlying Sharepoint site that is created automatically for that Team and customize it as their department Sharepoint site. So the department would be able to use the MS Team for Teams functions and open/link to the Sharepoint side underneath for all their departments Sharepoint needs. The Sharepoint would have permissions customized for different libraries and would also have things like Meta tags customized, etc. 
 Here is the kicker. Every event, training and MS rep I have ever spoken with has said the cardinal rule of Teams is you do not make customizations to the Sharepoint underlying a MS Team It is more of the engine underneath and you use Teams to drive the car; however, a new vendor we deal with contradicted that and said it is fine and using the underlying Sharepoint is the way to go. So I am doing somewhat of a sanity check. 
 So I am trying to crowdsource some real world examples of if/when this will cause issues. My opinion is we should be spinning up a separate Sharepoint site for each department but if I am wrong I would like to know know as well so I can grow. 
 I did some searching but couldn't find many concrete ways that utilizing and customizing the underlying Sharepoint site for a MS Team would cause issues/break things but I wanted to do my due diligence before we set out down this path if it is the wrong path.
 So I thought I would reach out to the community and see what everyone thought. 
 Cheers

 As much as this sucks, the place was pretty toxic and once I find a new job I'm sure I'll be much happier. My question is, how do I handle the question of why I'm looking for employment? I feel like telling a prospective employer that the job had a very negative impact on my mental health to the point that I started to make mistakes is probably not the best move.
 I've never been in a situation like this, so I would love to hear any advice. I actually have a phone interview later this week, but still shell shocked over the whole situation, and I'm not sure how to even talk about my current employment status.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am working on AD/Group Policy cleanup and organization and I've come across a few GPOs that are extended to our child domains.
 This is a bit new to me since the last two environments I worked out of did not follow this practice and would re-create the same GPO for each child domain.
 IE, If the parent root domain has a GPO for specific server configurations, that same GPO is re-created in each domain within the forest. A fairly manual task but leads to the creation of the GPO settings locally on the DC of that child domain.
 Now, I'm working with multiple GPOs that are extended, which is nice but I'm not entirely sure if it's ideal. I can't recall where I have read that this is bad practice and I can't narrow down why but I came across this Microsoft AD Design Considerations and Best Practices article that indicates it's a normal thing to do.
 AD: Design Considerations and Best Practices
 Based on the Microsoft article and it being semi-recently updated, I'm assuming that extending GPOs across domains is a normal practice?
 I'm more curious about the performance impact.
 On one of my child domains, I search my sysvol\child.domain\policies folder for a UniqueID of a GPO that is extended and I do not find it. This means that the computers need to reach out to the parent root domain for that policy, correct?
 While when I search for a locally created GPO UniqueID within the child.domain\policies folder, I find it obviously. 
 ​
 Any ideas or thoughts on this approach in managing GPOs on multiple domains within the same forest?
 Thanks

The windows clients received via Intune Putty and a shortcut pointing to Putty containing the IP address for the connection. Now we might have to update the IP address in that shortcut, so the plan would be to deploy a superseding app (the shortcut is deployed via script as a win32 app), but this of course will take some time, and I was thinking if there's a way to improve this kind of update. This time we can't just move the old server ip address to the new one as it will be still needed on the old one. What would be a good solution to connect all the clients to the new server without intervening on the clients?

 I’m pursuing a networking career and currently working as a field support technician (my job mostly involves tackling escalations, configuring/installing network devices and occasional server hardware installation or troubleshooting).
 I acquired my CCNA last year and I learned heaps from this certification.
 I really enjoy networking and would like to work toward getting the CCNP in the future. I understand there is a core exam (ENCOR) which needs to be passed before undertaking a concentration exam. I have very basic scripting knowledge but like idea of network automation and hoping to spark serious interest to this area.
 I may not know enough to properly make a decision on which specialty field to take for the concentration exam, but hypothetically speaking, if I were to choose the DevNet Professional for the concentration exam, would it make more sense for me to take the DEVASC exam rather than ENCOR?
 I would likely enjoy studying for the ENCOR exam since the topics appear very important to know and interesting but because I want to strengthen network programming, the DEVASC exam look nice as well.
 Btw I’m not in a rush to get CCNP certified, it’s something I would like to study slowly in addition to working full-time.
 Open to everyone’s opinion and advice!

 I understood what I was reading, how to implement changes, why are some areas are wrong, and so forth. I felt I was mid to senior level based on situations I resolved and people around me congratulating me.
 Then I start doing interviews and I couldn't really answer most if not all network questions. It was a eye opener and I believe it was because everything I learned was self taught, (googling, help command, reading past sailors notes, and good old trial and error). 
 My current gig title is a system/Network admin where I do software installs for ships and make sure no problems arise during the process. Not a lot of network problems pop up. I want to be a cloud network engineer in the next 5 years, so what is the best way to validate/better my skills as a network engineer in you guy's opinions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I have multiple client users who have developed problems with network drives (DFS shares). The only thing that changed on their system was a forced W11 update (not my decision). Whenever a user opens a folder on the shared drive, it's extremely slow and crashes Explorer.exe after that, or it hangs in the "Not Responding" state. This behavior is present while in the office or with a VPN from their home network. This issue is not present for everyone, only for a handful of users.
 What I've checked and done:
  
Checked that network speeds are fine -> Everyone is getting 100+ Mbps up and down.
 
Checked that system uptime is not crazy high.
 
SFC and DISM returned no issues.
 
Cleared Explorer cache
 
Made explorer run each window as a separate process.
 
All Windows updates are installed.
 
All "Lenovo System Updates" are installed.
 
Unmapped all drives and remapped them again.
 
Made sure that Defender are not scanning the network drives.
 
 The only thing that I've found out so far is that unmapping the drives fixes Explorer's slow speeds and crashes. These users rely heavily on these drives for their everyday work (Sharepoint migration is in the works but isn't going to be done soon).
 At this point I'm kinda out of ideas, can't even find anything to try. Does anyone know any fixes for this?

 Whether it's a comprehensive guide to Window/Linux administration, network management, or security best practices, I'm open to any suggestions that can help me become a more competent sysadmin.
 I'm looking for resources that are beginner-friendly, providing clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. It would be great if the books cater to both Windows and Linux environments since I'll end up working with both at some stage of my career.
 Additionally, I'm interested in hearing about any online resources, blogs, or podcasts that have been helpful to you in your sysadmin journey. Any supplemental learning materials that can be consumed during my commute would be fantastic!
 TIA

 I am looking for a tool to keep an inventory of computers complete with their components and ideally also with the software installed on them. Preferably a cloud solution to keep everything online.
 At this moment I found 2 good options but maybe you have something else to recommend.
 1 Option is Snipe IT (https://snipeitapp.com/)
 But that's only for inventory. I have to add computer specs manually.
 2 Option is PC Doctor Toolbox Remote (https://www.pc-doctor.com/solutions/toolbox)
 There I can add computers to an account and have everything I need at once but not as a list. I am not sure about this solution, won't it consume too much computer resources when transferring everything live?
 Thanks for your answers

 Edit to add extra info: The interview will be held online, and the invitation mentioned " splitting you into groups" which makes me think that it might be a group interview where multiple candidates will be present.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm having an issue with a Windows Server 2019 VM.
 The environment:
  
Single Host VMware ESXi 6.7.0 build17499825
 4 VM Windows Server 2019
  
Only one of the four VMs started to crash, no changes were made to the VM.
 This VM has some administrative software that is used by end users.
 What is happening:
  
VM works, I can connect through RDP
 Rdp connection closes unexpectedly
 From VMware console, I can see the VM is still on but in the Sign-in screen the network icon has a big red X on it.
 When I try to enter credentials, it just keeps loading forever
 When I reboot the VM, it loads until I see the Windows logo and then it restarts automatically
 After three times it goes in recovery mode
 Tried all usual stuff from a mounted Windows Server ISO (chkdsk, sfc scannow, dism, rebuild bcd... nothing works)
 I restored the VM from backups and then I took a snapshot from VMware
 The issue is that I can't check Windows logs to find out what happens during the crash as the VM becomes unresponsive. I can only revert to the snapshot.
 When I revert to the snapshot I can work inside the VM until the crash happens again.
 It seems that before the crash there are no error logs in the Event Viewer.
 I think it could be the software installed inside this VM that triggers the crash but I cannot get proof.
  
EDIT
  
I created a local user joined to local admin group
 I was able to log in after the network crash
 I can see that under Control Panel there are no network cards, it does not matter how many network cards I add from VMware ESXi
 It seems like a driver issue, in Device Management I see a lot of unknown devices with warnings 
  
Any ideas?
 Thank you

 Now i dont know if this is a possible thing im still new to Windows Server, but assuming it is
 We get lots of password reset requests from our users and i've seen that senior system admins have said this is not a priority it can be attended to in 4 hours they are not in a hurry
 but to me it's just a few clicks and the user is back on their workstation in no time it doesn't take time
 So i've been thinking why not give users the ability to reset their own domain passwords just like google, facebook etc allows us? it should spare us time to work on other things and gets the user back to production in little time

 I see a lot of "seemingly" good positions with decent wages.
 But recently a ton of them have for applications to send it to a email....nearly all of which have a generic domain, be it Outlook, Gmail, even a few old Hotmails in there.
 ​
 The consensus I get from others in the field is that if a company is too cheap to have its own domain, then there IT budget is likely a mess.
 But I am curious how cheap they are .
 Tried googling domain costs and I get different answers, some saying .net domains are like $3-5 Canadian to buy, others say .com are $15-20 Canadian to buy with another 20 or annually.
 Others say its $500 dollars.
 I get estimates all over the map, just curious what is a standard domain name initial buy and the annual fees and see how cheap a lot of these companies recruiting are.

We have a palo alto router and the switch is acting as a l2 switch for several ESXi hosts, passing all traffic to the PA. Earlier we had some problems with certain networks in esxi not being able to reach the gateway and rebooting the switch resolved the issue, leading me to think it was an issue with an incomplete arp table. 
 The issues from earlier have now reoccurred with networks that were not experiencing the problems earlier. Has anyone seen this before in this or other l2 switches?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 This might not be a good fit for this subreddit, but I'm curious whether any of you have heard of a Microsoft's recent offerings to protect the data stored within SQL Server databases, 'Transparent data encryption' (TDE) and 'Dynamic data masking' (DDM).
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view=sql-server-ver16
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking?view=sql-server-ver16
 My place of employment is investigating whether one of these methods might be useful to protect the data within some of our systems. 
 I'm not a DBA, I'm in an app support space, but I'm about to seek our vendor responses to either of these methods. As far as I can tell, with either method of encryption, the app is none the wiser, it's completely ignorant of the protection of the data in the same way that Windows apps are completely ignorant of the presence of BitLocker encrypting a HDD.
 As I say, this might not be applicable to this subreddit, but I'd love to know of anyone familiar with these technologies and if so, any gotchyas or caveats or horror stories.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was going through a few guides to configure FFrouting on linux, and I see that for most things one would need to manually enter the vtysh shell and input commands there. I would like to make a script for this, but how do I get my script to either enter the vtysh mode and then input commands/run commands in privileged mode without accessing the vtysh like a normal user? I haven't been able to find any method to do either from a shell script, I tried looking at how people would do it on Cisco hardware and see EEM scripts mentioned, but I don't know how to adapt them to my situation.
 I am very new to configuring routing protocols on linux and writing scripts for such purposes, sorry if this sounds like a stupid question. Thanks a bunch!
  
Edit: Found the solution! I'm really stupid for not noticing this earlier, but you can use vtysh -c and chain commands, just like you would use sh -c to chain and send commands to the POSIX shell from a different shell. Same concept, explained in the mention of its options on vtysh.
 Thanks everyone, I'll keep ansible in mind for next time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange situation, though maybe not all that uncommon. I inherited an environment where previous admin had configured an Enterprise CA. We are in the process of removing all the servers from one of our locations and this CA is there. In the past, it seems this were used by local web apps for our organization. However, we have moved towards using another CA in another AD forest for our web apps as we are obligated to use the new CA in another forest. The only certificates that are currently active, non expired, and issued are our domain controllers. 
 Can i go through the decommissioning and not transferring certificates to other AD Forest CA without disruption (i have no access to other CA)? Will this adversely affect our domain controllers? It seems like the domain controller certificates are elements to a Windows environment implementation and would not impact Windows Domain services, etc if I decomissioned properly.

However, I literally had a breakdown by the second or third occasion. I was just stalling the task for over a MONTH, literally dreading the task for 24/7.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've a been a network engineer for over 10 years and a I've always had to use Windows for my work. Most of the time I've used SecureCRT and I've recently discovered Tabby (cool software, btw).
 I found out last week that my employer allows us to use our own devices for work and so I'm thinking I'll start using my Linux desktop.
 I've been wondering what terminal app those of you that drive Linux for daily work use, meaning how you organize your device connection profiles, ssh credentials, etc. Do you simply create command aliases for devices? Or do you have let's say folders for locations, that hold one file per device in that location? Do you use build-in password managers?
 I'll use Tabby as an example. It has built-in password vault, connection profiles can be organized into folders and it also has a quick-command dialog (ctrl-shift-p), just like vs-code does that quickly allows you to browse through the saved connections or (for example) save output to file, etc.
 Is there a network admin-friendly terminal in Linux or do you guys just use the standard terminal app?
 Thanks for any suggestions!

 The OT networks use several different OT protocols, but a lot of them is "pure" L2 unicast and broadcast traffic (Profinet RT looking at you). I do not want to have interference between the OT networks.
 My gut feeling is telling me VN is the way to go, but since there is a limit in the amount of VN's, I do wonder if there are some other solution?

 In real life I've jumped jobs 3 times in 16 months trying to find a company worth being at.
 Legend has it (before my time), most of the old knowledge walked out the door and the owners brought in a bunch of new people. But it's the blind leading the blind. Like they are 100 tickets behind in support cases, customers are yelling at the support e-mail boxes every day, features are delayed, and nobody can barely train me to help at all on our software (Service desk is below my role but I'd do it just because they need it) because hardly anyone knows what's going on.
 I am grateful for the job but there's also something to be said for being proud of your workplace and, that I am not. Low-key can't see how they possibly are surviving much longer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if wrong sub please direct me to the right sub for this question then
 So basically I've been thinking about this and still don't quite get it. Take a standard Windows 10 Pro OS for example. If the BIOS isn't locked by a password, you just enter it and boot into a USB drive containing a Windows Password Recovery software and bam, you got access to the admin account since now you got the password to it. If the BIOS IS locked with a password, then you take out the CMOS for a minute, put it back in, now the BIOS has been reset and you can enter it again without any password, and now rinse and repeat what I've said earlier. If Bitlocker Pre-boot PIN is enabled, then you can just crack Bitlocker with a software like John The Ripper (but that's way more complicated than just using the software itself, there's many extra steps to it and it can take hours even, but I'm not going into that coz that'd take too much time and space). So Bitlocker doesn't protect someone from knowledgeable people like IT forensics (working for the police), a BIOS password also doesn't. Windows also includes a lot of telemetry by Microsoft by default, so if you're super paranoid, then again it's not a good OS.
 I could go on and on about the many different exploits of the Windows OS. Why do companies still use Windows Enterprise as the OS on their workstations (unless we're talking servers but here I'm not; I'm talking about the workstations employees use, on their company laptops etc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a Windows shop with about 4000 endpoints using SCCM. I needed to push out a .exe we received from a vendor (which puts files in the user’s AppData folder) to clients with a silent switch. I created a PS script to copy the .exe to the machine, run install and put a validation file on the C:/folder so SCCM can figure out if it has run or not. If I manually ‘Run Script’ for that machine it will work fine. I created a package to be able to create a schedule/required install and it always prompts for elevation when the endpoint tries to run the script. If I take that same script and copy it to the endpoint and try run it, it won’t run because the script is not remote signed. I am unable to set the execution to unsigned or bypass because we have the GPO set to only allow local scripts and remote signed. I’ve tried this as a domain admin and get the same result. We also have used the PSAppDeploy scripts before with no issue and those have stopped working too. I’m quite certain that the -bypass in the script is not working now either when it tries to run. We have been running this same setup for years and have not had this issue before. There is one code sign cert on the endpoints from ‘Microsoft’ that did expire a couple weeks ago but I don’t know where that came from or how to renew it. All the certs on the SCCM server are valid (but none of them are a code sign cert). We do have a CA and I’ve tried to create a code sign cert to push but I haven’t gotten that working yet. Any ideas as to why this would all of a sudden be an issue or how I can get this working?

 I''ve recently accepted a position as senior system engineer for a big company. 
 I've been in the role for 10y+, multiple small, medium and big firms, but what've found here is singular (for me).
 In every company i worked for, we used to have some kind of sandbox envoironmanet, some old vmware vsphere or cluster or cloud of some kind available for the only purpose of checking new technology, thinkering around, stay on the edge somehow. Here there's nothing like that: all the envs must always stay in a "working" condition, and every new implementation must be approved, analized, and green lighted ON EVERY ENVIRONMENT.
 I talked to the management about that and they agreed it could be important to have a destructable and rebuiltable envs for study purposes, something agile, but also it's not prioritized: it's literally the last entry on the to-do list.
 Here it comes my question: there's some kind of literature about the importance of having this kind of things? Something that would help my needs climbing the to-do list. 
 ​
 TLDR: My bosses are totaly ok with me standing idle if there's nothing "broken to fix", I'd love to them to provide us a R&D env for playing. Looking for some literature to back my request

 Our MSP set up an autopilot policy for us, it’s been working fine but doesn’t remember the last user signed in. Users therefore have to enter their username every time they want to unlock their machine. 
 For the life of me I can’t find where this setting is inside the settings picker. I can find “Interactive Logon Do Not Display Last Signed In” but this is not enabled. 
 I’m hoping to avoid having to rebuild the entire thing just to sort this out, so hopefully somebody has an answer!
 Enjoy the long weekend :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Speedport Entry 2i router from Telekom. Yesterday there was a storm in my area but I disconnected the router out of electricity before the storm started. However, after the storm, my router started behaving weird. After that, only the lights of Power and WLAN were turned on. However, if I turn on my pc, and this router is connected through an ethernet with it, and I navigate to 192.168.1.1 -> status -> Refresh, the ADLS, Online and Telephone lights start turning on one by one and my Wifi works perfectly again. I tried physically restarting the router but no luck. Basically, WiFi works only when I have my pc, connected through an ethernet with my router, turned on and have the router refreshed software-wise from 192.168.1.1. Before calling the custom support, does anyone stumbled upon an issue like this and do you know what could be the cause? Could it be that my router is broken or some signaling/networking issue is present?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying to achieve a situation where I can generate a persistent ssh host key every boot. My (custom) initramfs is build into the kernel which is signed and securely booted with my own PK in TPM.
 In the initramfs I have build tpm2-tools, dropbear and cryptsetup alike for decryption of the main rootFS, based on TPM2 PCRs/LUKS.
 Now in case any of the PCRs change the rootfs will not mount and I will be in a situation where I'll have to ssh in and decide if I want to accept any changes in the PCR registers and add a new unseal policy to allow luks decryption which more or less works fine.
 The challenge comes that I do not store dropbear ssh host keys in the initramfs, figuring they would be readable from the signed efi kernel by taking out the bootdisk and thus would allow mitm/decryption of my ssh session while manually logging in to fix the pcr/luks decription.
 This makes it so that I get the obvious warning that the host key changed everytime I ssh into initramfs.
 My thinking is there should be a way to get, or more likely generate, a fixed host key from TPM/PCR to feed to dropbear that would not live on the boot disk.
 Anyone have any suggestions how to do this? All TPM/ssh examples I find are for the easy solution to store client keys, not the host key...

Currently we just store information on hard drives, but we’d like a cloud solution to access anywhere. Anyone have any recommendations or sources?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have a few weeks of international travel coming up soon, and trying to see if there is a good way for me to just bring one laptop but isolate the company stuff and my personal stuff via dual boot.
 We have a company issued Lenovo laptop, fully managed by Microsoft Intune. I also have a personal Dell laptop, I can add that to my authorized device and access company resources.
 Brought two laptops last time I traveled and it was a PITA, hence wanting to bring only 1 laptop this time around, but want to make sure I isolate the company stuff and personal stuff completely.
 Thinking about the following options:
 1. Bring company Lenovo, install a copy of Windows into a portable SSD, and boot from the portable SSD when I need to use it for personal. 
 Pro is I can disconnect the SSD physically when I don't need my personal stuff to isolate it. 
 Concern is if the company will be able to scan my personal data without me booting into the company copy of Windows(such as BIOS backdoor), and if it allow me to boot from portable SSD (this one I can test out).
 2. Bring my Dell laptop, install a copy of Windows into portable SSD and add it to authorized device to access company resources.
 Pro is I think the company control for personal device is less than corporate issued device, or at least they claim it to be.
 Concern is my personal data will be in the internal SSD and they may scan it if I boot from portable SSD and not remove the internal SSD.
 3. Bring my Dell laptop, install the company managed OS into internal drive, and install my personal OS into portable SSD.
 Probably the safer way, but more work and more PITA.
 ​
 Wonder what you think would be the best option in terms of data isolation from company IT admin perspective, appreciate any input you may have

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably my biggest issue for 3rd party tech support. When your ISP has a device that has either packet loss or high latency issues.
 Currently our ISP's device has higher than normal latency. It's a solid 70ms. I have tested pings from a few remote work buildings, my house and other tech houses. They are all the same. Every hop up to that point is low. Averaging below 20ms. But this last hop is always 70ms. It's the ISP's device in our building that connects to our firewall/router.
 Every trouble ticket we create with them goes nowhere. They say it's fine. It's fine for web traffic and stuff. But for VPN's that users run windows file copies over it sucks! Due to the Windows SMB protocol acting like trash the higher the latency goes.
 Wish I knew a way to get it through to ISP's for these kind of issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got 4x pm9a3 U.2 Drives setup in a raid 0 as a a scratch drive.
 I will run an FIO speed test and normally the first time after building the raid/booting it will get the speeds it should around 25gb/s and maintain it as long as I let the test run.
 If I stop the test and restart the exact same command it will only get speeds of 11gb/s most of the time, although sometimes I can restart the test once or twice before it will drop.
 Write speeds are always fine at around 15gb/s even when the reads are stuck at 11gb/s
 I have tested the drives individually and they seem to remain stable at around 6.5gb/s, using the same commands, regardless of how many times I start the test.
 To make things even stranger, if I only create a raid of 3 devices I get the ~18gb/s it should but then the speed will drop to 11gb/s with this as well!
 Example of raid command I am using:
 mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md/nvme --name=nvme --level=0 --raid-devices=4 /dev/nvme[1-4]n1
 Using the FIO commands from here, although I have tried tweaking them but doesn't seem to help.https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/benchmarking-pd-performance
 It has to be formatted as xfs.
 It is a dual socket 64core epyc milan system, all drives are connected to the same CPU.
 I am at a loss, any ideas?
 EDIT: Was messing with it and decided to try removing the sudo from the command, and suddenly it went to full speed again, then when I tried to run the command again, back to half speed.
 Seems anytime I change the user running the command it will work the first time, this is WAY over my head!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently posted my issue about a SQL server logs rapidly growing with no Google-able fix found. A fix was found, and it turned out that a replication to a data warehouse server was broken, and the data failures were logged and never released. We killed the replication properly and the log reduction was instant.
 The only change I made was migrating the data warehouse server to our new vmware environment (new hosts, data stores, vswitches, everything) from the prior vmware environment shared by my SQL server. 
 Would this have been my issue? That the migration broke some non TCP-IP connection? Or was this coincidental?

 I’ve been tasked with looking at ONIE switching for our 2 rack colo deployment. 
 The reason for ONIE is a management push but I am hesitant and pushing back. 
 While I can see the benefit for larger networks, I don’t know that there will be enough resources to manage it at the current moment or if it makes sense. (If it is easier than I think it to be please share your experiences) Also licensing costs. 
 This would be a 1G Fiber uplink for the first year then it would bump up to 10G on year two. 
 Ideally it would be great to future proof it to an extent. (SFP28 of SFP+ as an example.)
 EdgeCore and Dell ON series are switches that have come up frequently during my research but have not had direct experience with them in the past.

 Do you guys know about any software or tools that I can use to roll out apps, require updates, deploy network profiles, and see battery health and disk space available?
 The summer camp I work for recently acquired a fleet of laptops for some classes and activities. I told them that it would be a good idea for us to be able to manage the laptops from a central location to be able to keep an eye on all of them and keep them ready for classes.
 I have been looking at open RMM and MDM solutions and have tested MeshCentral and Fleet but I am wondering if I am looking for the wrong products.
 Ideally I am looking for a solution that we can host on-premises without requiring a subscription or license, or a service we can rent that would cost less than a few hundred dollars a year for about 100-200 devices.
 Thanks and sorry in advanced if this is the wrong forum or the post is not formatted correctly.

What is the easiest way to tackle having one common printer per floor and building and making sure Bob in building A part of team B is not sending a print job of 1000 copies to Building D a few kilometers away.

 I'm currently running a more or less consumer computer at home with Hyper-V Server 2019, with two Windows VM's (one is a Domain Controller) and five Linux VM's. 
 Now.. afaik Hyper V Server is discontinued, so there will be no 2022 version. Support for it though will continue until 2019, so this should be the issue. My question tho is:
 What should be better?
  
Hyper-V Server 2019 with two Windows VM's and five Linux VM's
 Windows Server Core with Hyper-V role and two Windows VM's and five Linux VM's
 Windows Server Core with Hyper-V & Domain Controller roles, one Windows VM and five Linux VM's.
  
Any ideas?
 About the third option: I rarely encounter an issue where my Domain Controller VM isn't reachable or up, which could result in auth issues with my Hyper-V server, which is part of the domain, so both bundled together would more or less elminate the issue.
 I know there's already this thread, but this is now 3 years older and is about Windows Server with Desktop, so a lil' bit different.

I would allow them to assign trunks shut down trunks etc. 
 CLI with priv levels wouldn't be a solution. I need something more user friendly and easy to read. I tried playing with https GUI but i can't seem to make priv levels to work. I managed either readonly or full access. I tried to define a priv level 5 that would allow some commands, in CLI works but in GUI it doesn't.

buy a license, activate the windows in a VM in hyperv. Can run the machine for years or destroy it next month, create a new VM, fresh install, activate. As long as you are not attempting to run two VMs with same license you are good.
  
What I suspect
  
Once that VM is activated you better not "lose" that VM. The license is tight to some HW ID of that one VM, reinstalls can be done on that one machine.
  
What I fear
  
Oh you cant even use the typical win pro license in hyperv. you have to buy windows server 2016, 2019, 2022,.. special license with whatever cal sublinceses for machines/users that would connect to that machine

I don’t know what the proper title would be outside of education. I’m not a director as it would commonly be defined. I manage all technology in the district — planning, budgeting, implementation, maintenance, and decommissioning. Network, servers, security, etc, etc. I have a part time technician that I manage. 
 I know a little about everything but I don’t know if I know enough about any particular sets of skills. I’m also scared I have learned bad habits from being solo for so long. Everything I’m looking at job-wise either seems too advanced or too entry-level. 
 Just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar spot and what the outcome was.

We are considering it but thinking to push implementation to 1st quarter next year as it looks like it’s going to run up against our busy manufacturing season. Netsuite is on the hard sell to sign the paper before the end of may as it’s “the best prices you will get all year”. Is that true? Are end of year may prices better than what we will get in February I feel we are dealing with used car salespeople. I mean I get a call from a rookie Dell salesman and I swear every month is their end of quarter.

 Unbelievably slow saves when using mainstream apps like Autodesk Inventor

 At first co-workers were doing very well in identifying the phishing tests and seemed to like the phishing alert buttons convenience. But I think the button has now become TOO convenient. 
 Most of the phish alerts I get are not phishing emails, some are emails that we are sending for employees to do cyber security training OR they are emails from things they have subscribed to, so now the button is being used like its a filter for emails they just don't want to read. 
 Should I just send out a mass email explaining the importance of using the phishing alert button correctly? Re-do training? or just be happy they are using it at all? 
 I mean, it doesn't take that much time for me to see that most of the alerts aren't important, but it does take a bit of time to go through them all to find the actual phishing attempts. 
 ​
 TLDR: Employees are spamming phishing alert button for emails they don't like, should I re-do training, send email, or care at all?

UK authorities are simply not interested at this juncture as we can not prove any financial loss, but he got pretty close recently. I keep issuing takedown request on these domains which has been relatively prompt, but the lack of interest from Instagram and UK mobile providers has been disappointing to say the least. I get the impression this will go on ad-infimum until we are significantly more proactive in our defence.
 Obviously, this is not the forum for legal advice, but from a technological perspective has anyone experience of or alternatives to Domains tools Iris Detect to monitor for lookalike domains please? Indeed any other UK specific advice would be very welcome.

Anyone have a MS partner that would recommend for EA renewals?

The phones display a message that they are unable to power the accessory. I reached out to Fortinet and it sounded as though there may be a known bug but the workaround they provided didn't resolve anything. I have a number of switches to replace and don't want to run into this issue at future sites. Has anyone come across this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We market a software solution that runs in the cloud or on our infrastructure for most of our customers. One of our customers (very large for our situation) insists that if we want to continue the collaboration we need to migrate the service to their servers (excuses about standards and regulations, middle management and users want to expand, IT is blocking us, senior management is labile). The problem is that we are afraid for our intellectual property, because their IT department (4x bigger than our whole company) is doing similar things to what we offer to the market. 
 So I wonder, is it possible to encrypt a virtual server running on someone else's physical server in such a way that the owner of the physical server cannot bypass the protection?
 They run VMWare EXSi, we run HyperV, and my knowledge of VMware is quite limited, so a detailed explanation would be appreciated.
 Thanks!

 Most have been removed from the original company portal when it was given to me, but occasionally they forget and it's pain in the ass. In other situations, the original company no longer even exists and all the equipment leftover from a take-over is stuck in limbo.
 Are there brands that are particularly troublesome and not as safe or easy to wipe for resell?
 To name a few I have:
  
Aruba - I'm told that transferring the license from locked aruba equipment can be particularly difficult even when 
 Cisco
 Meraki - Someone mentioned the are essentially bricks?
 Ubiquiti - I'm told as long as these are fully reset it should wipe their portal information out
 Juniper
 Peplink
 Netgear
 Fortinet
 Tp-Link
  
I might be missing some others.

I am being told by Nokia that the 7360's will only allow the proxy to be configured to remove the SSM source that the settop STB sends to the OLT, and change the IGMP joins to *,G joins, and therefore we must do IGMP translations on the edge routers to get them back to SSM IGMP joins, and that is the standard for NOKIA and all ISP do it that way.
 Anyone doing this today and not doing it this way, or doing it this way?

 Never say never - especially to the management!
 So in Q1 this stupid OKR was set to "reduce running costs by 10% by the end of the year" by a management who doesn’t have any idea how things work in IT. They complain that we have too many subscriptions, claiming that surely there are a few that aren't essential, without even knowing which tool does what. At the end of the day, it's more about workplace politics than facing the reality so we had to keep that OKR and "see what we can do." (rolling_eyes)

Recently, Apple and Samsung have started using HEIC as a default format, and it's driving our claims folks nuts since there's no easy way to open them without the 99 cent converter (which, since it's needed to be purchased from the windows store per user account, has been a fairly unattractive option). 
 The only work around we've found so far is providing the few folks who handle the incoming images with a copy of GIMP, but it's far from an elegant solution when there's a couple dozen images needing to be converted one at a time. In addition, we're starting to see the format pop up more often with remote folks sending in photos of forms with PII on them, so online converters are completely out of the question. 
 Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

 AADSTS700016: Application with identifier '[app id identifier i didn't setup]' was not found in the directory '[companyname]'. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant or consented to by any user in the tenant. You may have sent your authentication request to the wrong tenant. 
 I've tried a combination of looking on CodeTwos troubleshooting forums and install guides and most of them are for installing the paid software and creating an app registration in Azure. Even if I create an app registration in azure for CodeTwo and assign the permissions the guide says, I don't see a way to connect that app registration to code two since registering an app automatically generates an app ID that's different from the one displayed in that error message with no way to change it. 
 My question is, how am I supposed to register an application in Azure that isn't in the Azure App Library when I can't assign the applications identifier to that registration, as well as not being able to change the identifier of the application because I didn't make it. (All the guides on how to change an app ID seem to be to the tune of "adjust it in the code") 
 I was looking into it potentially being a misconfigured consent issue, since we don't get the "The app needs the following permissions" and "Consent on behalf of your organization page", but I'm not exactly clear on how to enable that either. 
 Any help from the hivemind is greatly appreciated.

 The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the server olddc$. The target name used was cifs/OLDDC.TCH.local. This indicates that the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client. This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Ensure that the target SPN is only registered on the account used by the server. This error can also happen if the target service account password is different than what is configured on the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for that target service. Ensure that the service on the server and the KDC are both configured to use the same password. If the server name is not fully qualified, and the target domain (.LOCAL) is different from the client domain (.LOCAL), check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains, or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR
 I work as an online developer for a large tech company (+20k employees worldwide).
 As a basically Windows-only shop, how difficult is it for a company like this to allow and authorize Linux dev machines?
 I imagine there are security considerations (patching/updates) and other stuff. Is it reasonable that they give us a "hard no" on this request?
 Background (if you want more details):
 Many of us prefer to work in a native Linux environment, but this is not authorized by our company. Since pretty much have free reign over our dev machines, some of us have installed Linux in dual boot. Others use a Linux bootable USB.
 These actions aren't authorized by IT, but so far, our local IT guys have been sympathetic and have adopted a "don't ask, don't tell" kind of attitude, which works for us.
 Many devs don't want to risk it, and use WSL. Most complain about it all day (stability, perf, etc..)
 We'd like to stop working in the shadows and get official authorization from our IT dept. We're wondering if they're just "lazy/inept", or if supporting Linux in a large company like this is prohibitively complex/expensive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upfront - I'm underwhelmed by antivirus and EDR providers. Perhaps I'm suffering from working in a small company (just 100 endpoints), so maybe the products are better than my experiences so far.
 We are with Cybereason, currently on NGAV but due to replace with EDR in September. The support has been awful. For example, Cybereason is currently detecting itself (coreminion.dll) as being Malware (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/). But only on one machine. I've seen other examples of legit software flagged on a handful of our endpoints, but not on most. It's just so wildly inconsistent, despite everything being in the same policy group, updated, and so on.
 Crowdstrike - looked promising, but awful sales experience. I've been blunt about how our purchasing decisions are made (we have an annual budget - if it isn't in that, it's not happening) and given windows when it's good to speak (i.e. two months before I confirm my budget for next year!). This doesn't stop me being harassed by calls and emails, including one rather embarrassing "My manager said I'm in trouble for giving you this price, but I can honour it if you buy now!" call.
 Watchguard - support was absolutely appalling, and their Panda EDR client trashed our Linux laptops.
 So, two questions:
  
Have I just been unfortunate with Cybereason - are those on the EDR or MDR solution finding a more pleasant time. What is your feedback?
 Are AV providers just shitty, or is it because we're such a small account? Would we be better using a MSSP? I'm wary of MSSPs because I've worked for a few MSPs who have tried their hand at security, and I'd not trust them anywhere near our small estate.
  
I'd be grateful for thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never understood how this could be possible, maybe you folks have some ideas. It's not an issue at present but a problem I never got an answer to. We would see this usually when a specific firewall model was about to fail and starts acting buggy and shortly after totally dead (needing reboots and dropping connections the weeks leading up to failure sort of thing). Seen the exact scenario at least 3 times with this hardware.
 Anyhow when the FW would have it's issues devices on the LAN would also stop working bringing, basically the entire switch is affected for locally hosted programs that typically continue to work when internet is down otherwise. We replace the FW with a new model all is fine of course, but it's alwaysbleft me confused.
 My question though is how is the L3 firewall/gateway managing to screw up a dumb switch for L2 communication? I understand while it's having issues internet may not work but this phenomenon feels like it violates everything I learned about the OSI model?? 
 I can only think something with ARP getting messed up or basically FW overloading the switch and basically DoS it? 
 Simple flat layout. Single LAN/24, dumb switch, no VLANs, nothing crazy configuration-wise

 Have any of you smart folks out there deployed these CBS350 switches from Cisco?
 I've recently deployed a 2x CBS350-48FP-4X stack and the CPU is pinned at 100% during production hours. There's a 2x CBS350-24FP-4X stack in the same location with an almost identical config and that thing is fine.
 I usually work with IOS derived devices but this seems to be an "ROS" device and the usual 'show process cpu sorted' etc commands don't exist.
 This problem exists on 3.2 and 3.3 (the latest as of writing this) firmwares.
 The stack is based in a hub office and the config isn't complicated, it has 9 APs, 2 firewalls in HA, 2 routers in HA, a couple of door entry controllers, a cctv dvr, a couple of ACLs and 1 static route. There are no cameras plugged into …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am struggling a bit to find the fastest way to delete mail from people's mailboxes when there is a security incident. For the past two weeks we have had multiple comprised users falling for phishing. We have monthly simulations, have phishing set to aggressive block in M365, various endpoint lockdowns, external header flagging, external banner flagging, the MS setting that says, "you don't regular get mail from this person, etc." We also block many top level domains in DNS filter, block new domain, etc. If anything the complaints from the execs and users are "too much email security."
 Despite all this, stuff comes through. M365 will alert us but unless it is in quarantine, I can't find a way to easily delete it for box that it exists in. What 'sometimes' works is
 ​
  
Connect-ExchangeOnline
  
Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName <your UPN> * New-ComplianceSearch -name "suspicious emails" -ExchangeLocation all -ContentMatchQuery 'subject:"suspicious"' * Start-ComplianceSearch “suspicious emails” * New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName “suspicious emails” -purge -purgetype SoftDelete/HardDelete
 This is cumbersome and does not always complete due to powershell errors and/or our team rushing to get it done fast. Last night it would not accept the 'purge' argument for reasons I did not determine. I also need to set the security to "winrm basic" to run this and then change it back again when done.
 reference https://www.codetwo.com/admins-blog/new-compliancesearch-new-version-of-search-mailbox/
 I am also trying to delete from Trace \ go hunt for this message" \ "advanced hunting" and though I find the mail and take action to delete it, it does not appear to delete.
 What I am looking for is to the fastest way, ideally through the GUI, to locate all mails from a sender and /or subject and delete.
 Thx!

 I’m looking to find a good solution for storing secure documents. For clarification, these are not physical documents. These are things like word docs that have all of our server configuration information; data center documents with our network diagrams, firewall info, etc.; and even documents where we keep things like vendor account information. 
 I know with 365 we can set document restrictions, but that just doesn’t feel like enough. So, what are you all using to store these sensitive documents in a place that can be set up with access lists for team members? Any and all suggestions welcome at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Been struggling lately with a project. Everything is behind NDA with too small group knowing about it and it's starts to affect the performance. There is just too much to do in a small time window, that I'm getting the feeling that we have to either:
 a) attain more people to help on project
 b) postpone some aspects for later implementation, but that would be seen as bad plannig on my end 
 but..
 a) C-level don't want to involve any more people. Straight up no, just drop the topic.
 b) Deadline is set. There is some serious $$ involved and I'm sure they would rather fail partly and fix it after the deadline.. but that would be my problem to fix later on , while they will put the blame one someone else. 
 Another idea was to persuade most of project members to my ideas, but that takes time, which is running out. My question is how do you find a workaround in those situations and go with how you propose? 
 P.S. and please, no "CY@/leave as see what they do", cause in the end, when the milk was already spilled and you get the blame or bad looks it's already too late, since there seems to be distrust whether you are capable of working on bigger projects..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m considering changing part of my approach to how I manage filtering of DNS and web requests. 
 I currently have EDR software installed on all workstations and DNS filtering software in place, however, I still see phishing from the plethora of new TLD’s. In particular, the whole .zip and .mov TLD debacle got me thinking.
 Don’t get me wrong, the spam filters GENERALLY catch the phishing, but they’re not 100% and I really like defense in depth.
 I’d like to change to whitelisting TLD’s instead of blacklisting. Obvious I’d need the usual suspects like .com, .gov, .mil, national domain’s etc. I’d probably also add some of the newer ones that actually see some legit traffic like .museum. 
 Has anyone done this? What lessons did you learn and what pitfalls should I watch out for?
 Thanks!

We frequently get reports from clients about Trend popping up saying "Upgrading Trend Micro Apex One to the latest version will take a few minutes" The clients already have the latest client, rebooting doesn't seem to make it go away and re-install is the only fix. Any reason why this is happening? Is it on the server end? Or something is wrong with the client.

 The same 51GB file copied to a mount point (C:\clusterstorage\volume1) transfers at 410MB/s and takes minutes. 
 It's the same thing with exporting a VM. Anything on the mountpoint is slow. Anything on a mapped drive is really fast and it's tested on different hosts in different sites. 
 It's the same situation on a cluster in a different site and MPIO is configured as per the SAN vendor's documentation. 
 Hoping someone will have some suggestions.

 Is there a rough guideline of what Certifications or Knowledge I'd need to have to get on to the Internal IT team? I have a massive curiosity for Sysadmin work and I'm really interested in AD. 
 I also have a massive wealth of knowledge in Hardware both Consumer and Professional (Servers, Blade Servers etc.) 
 As for trying to find out about requirements internally I don't think I'm in a position to ask about that considering how new I am.

A previous admin has changed all the passwords and unfortunately didn't sync them correctly, which means all the passwords weren't saved. I have found a video on YouTube where someone can reset passwords by opening a case and switching off a button on motherboard of a printer. I don't really know if that can work but I suppose so. Any other ideas would be appreciated, because a technician wants 200 dollar pro printer and we don't have that much money. Thank you all

 Yea sure. I never logged on to it as i thought it was actually managed (this was my mistake)
 Since it was 2012r2 (we are in the process of upgrading) i logged on today with my admin credentials... and they don't work. I check the documentation and find out that there is a password. 
 Obviously .\administrator.
 Turns out:
 The server is not joined to the domain, no windows license configured, just one dns, local administrator, no antivirus, UAC disabled, no antivirus, last windows patch january 2020, anydesk installed.
 A poster for worst practice.

We are certifying for cyber essential plus and I have a few questions around the audit it’s self. I can’t get out of this as it some thing they are doing 
 Q1. Colleague access 365 services from personal devices, we control access by in tune MEM. With additional policy’s around OS levels. Colleagues require to authenticate one a week with MFA. Would it be fair in saying on the day of the audit only devices that have accessed info on that week would be under scope? If so what testing do they actually under go. We allow iOS, andriod and windows devices to access info this way. 
 Q2. The requirements are that os levels be up todate, but looking more in to requirements is it fair to say that andriod 11 would be complaint Os as this is still recieving support ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm looking for some sort of routing-protocol or other function/mechanic that can solve my following problem:
 I have an HQ and a side-branch (SB). They are connected via EtherLink (~ 200km distance).
 Basically all VLANS are L2 transparent connected between both sides, giving me the same IP Address-space, WiFi-Networks, etc... over both locations.
 All inter-VLAN Routing takes place on the Core-Switch at HQ. Internet Connection is also only at HQ. Any connections to the internet from SB goes through HQ.
 In the event that the EtherLink goes down, Inter-VLAN routing at SB is not possible anymore. How can I make Inter-VLAN routing possible at the Core-Switch at SB in the case that the EtherLink to HQ goes down? Internet Connectivity is not a requirement in this case.
 €dit: I should mention that I'm using a HPE 10504 as the Core@HQ and a HPE FlexFabric 5940 as Core@SB. Other switches on both sides are all HPE. Mostly 5510 and 5130.

 Due to organizational matter, In my company we need to see/list in udadmin into our license server only the devices connected, not the users. Surfing for days around the net I understand that it probably depends on the License Type and on how are installed.
 The strange thing is that a couple of those device we have are already listed like this and they connect/show as device (thin clients) without listing the username as well. For the rest we use also windows laptops as well so we have a mix. We own a Citrix On-Prem server where the employees connect to their desktop via ICA/Receiver.
 Is there a way to re-install the license and associate it per device and not per user on the physical machine? Any hints? Citrix Inc. seems like to be very conservative and limited about it, and I couldn’t find much around the net.
 Thank you! 😊

 Let’s say replacing the system is not an option and running a new cable is not an option, what are some ways I can extend the wireless network? The solution doesn’t have to be super cheap but would want to keep it under 500/600. 
 Are there any decent Wi-Fi extenders or something out there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planning network config for a small company - setting up one office in the UK and one in India, will have 1-2 APs at each for now (max 5-6 users at each). No on-prem servers, everything in the cloud. 1 Gbps symmetric fiber at both sites.
 Easy management is key, as I will usually be thousands of miles away from either office (and overseeing IT is maybe 5% of my job) - so a single pane of glass for routers/FWs/APs would be great if possible.
 Somewhat budget conscious - would be great to avoid hefty subscription costs if possible.
 Among prosumer-ish stuff, I don't trust Ubiquiti beyond their APs, and TP-Link Omada likely won't be acceptable in this particular application.
 Thoughts on Engenius, which seems to have a single pane cloud solution with their ESG510 gateway + APs?
 Or I guess could give up the single pane and do, say, Aruba InstantOn for APs and something else for FWs (maybe Fortinet FortiGate 60F/70F?). Any other reasonable FW options?
 Any other ideas?

 These contacts have filled the "file as" field with "surname, name". I can see that in each vCard and in some contacts in the default list overview. But not in all.
 If i open the vcard, safe as an other format its directly shown. 
 Its not a bug in the software. We checked that with the vendor. Did anybody of you have an idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a former DevOps guy, and bought some commercial real estate. Looking to setup wifi and network across a 25k SF multi-tenant building. Cinderblock walls that are concrete filled, so signal doesn't travel well between units. Looking for suggestions on best "cheap used enterprise" hardware to look at. Don't have much experience with Cisco, Aruba, Arista, etc. Read dozens of threads and can't tell whats legit and what's a Ford vs Chevy thing. Tried using 30 Google WiFi routers in topology described below and it failed horribly. Tenants are mom and pop so just needing basic wifi across the building plus extensive security system cause building is in the ghetto. 
 Cat6 to each unit from roof, forming wired backbone of one hard-wired AP per unit into 2-3 48 port POE switches. Add more wireless APs in each unit to form a hybrid mesh network without have to run more Cat6 everywhere. Wired backbone would also contain dozens of POE security cameras. Wired backbone would have a few switches spread geographically aross the building (left, right, center) and all connected by SPF uplinks.
 I want to avoid licensing fees and recurring costs. Ideally I can buy cheap enterprise hardware on ebay/offerup, link it all up, write a script or two for configuration (or click some buttons on a web portal) and be done. If need to expand, buy more of the same used gear then plug and play to expand the network. Don't want to worry about getting bricked out because a vendor discontinues some cloud product or because my license expired or I didn't buy from approved vendors. Also confused on the internal vs external wireless controller -- seems like sometimes thay is part of the AP and other times it is seperate?
 What brands/models do you all recommend and why? Give me a shopping list that can get it done as cheap, easy and robust as possible. I like the idea of buying used in bulk and then developing a scalable I can replicate on any future building I buy.

 Linux - rg-linux
 Keyvaults - rg-keyvault

 vnet - rg-virtualnetwork
 NSG - rg-nsg

 ​
 Or would it make more sense to do something similar, but consolidate NSG, Vnet, etc into a rg such as rg-networking?
 ​
 Or combine resources that are used for each other, I.E a VM with a NIC, vnet, nsg, etc?
 ​

 One vendor has some shady AF tactics by sending us depreciation notices for competitors, for products we're even evaluating. There's some other mud slinging shenanigans that are just underhanded and not professional.
 The second doesn't meet several of our core criteria, so they're already disqualified, but have the best price. 
 The third bone head is borderline harassing my staff calling and texting several times a day. We're a slow decision making process because of the cost, and won't let up. Then he drops the bombshell that he's desperate to make the sale because he'll lose his job if he doesn't close with us.
 Now I'm left with an ethics problem that may disqualify this vendor. And the swarmy sales guy makes me want to ditch the first. Ugh... I don't ever remember purchasing being this hard. 
 Now what do I do?

 And got locked out coz something didn't work and I tried to ssh many times, thus making fail2ban kill my existing ssh connection.
 Thought I could just ask my friend who also has ssh access to the server, turns out he didn't even setup an ssh-key even tho I told him to do so before I closed off password authentication.
 none of the oracle cloud control panel's console shell or run command option were working for some reason
 I freakin make a recovery instance, detached the boot volume of the broken server, attached it to the recovery instance, fixed the config, and then re-attached the boot volume where it belonged
 It may not sound like much but I'm just 17 and have no professional courses or certificates when it comes to oracle cloud (or any other cloud) and sysadmin.
 I feel so confident on my sysadmin skills.
 After this I don't feel like a kiddo when I say that I'm a decent sysadmin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for long post, I'm thinking about this for a week now, and I don't have anyone to talk to.
 So here is a situation, after 3 years of different admins doing shit they didn't document, it is my turn to have fun. I recently got promoted from help desk, because 2 admins left.
 And here comes the fun part.
 All Managers are in DA group. There is a Local Admin policy but it is linked to whole domain. Admin rights are given using restricted groups policy.
 My plan to fix this mess is to create 3 groups. Workstation admins, Developers, Server admins. Also 3 policies one to link to workstations OU, second also to workstations (but restrict it to apply only to developers Desktops) and third to server OU.
 I will create separate accounts for administration and add them to groups.
 Workstation admins will be 2 of our helpdesk guys, I will also give them righs to add PC to domain.
 Developers will be all Developers (don't ask me why, they cry to the management if they don't get admin rights. And they love them more since they make money)
 Server admins will be me, 1 colleague and CEO
 And I will leave only Domain Administrator in DA group and restrict access to all machines except Domain Controllers.
 First question is do you think that this plan is good? Do you have any other advice?
 Second question is, since a lot of members of DA group and Local Admin group are already logged in to some Workstations and Servers, and they won't lose admin access on those machines untill I restart them. What is a best way to remove them without reboot, but also apply new policies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine a situation where one is setting up a small network. There is to be some sort of physical server on the network with a VM running a webserver or mailserver or something that is exposed to the WAN. Obviously one should set up a firewall in this case. The physical server still has much memory and CPU time which is unused.
 As far is security is concerned, which one is better: using a dedicated physical firewall machine or adding a software-defined virtal firewall? Which is standard practice? In general, are security-oriented network services best kept physical for more guaranteed compartmentalization or best integrated into the SDN for simplicity (or something else)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seeing the other topic about emails reminded me of this happening last week. 
 User tells me an email to a government agency never made it there in time, and that it is going to cost us funding money. They want me to go look in the system and see if it ever left Exchange. They had sent it the week before, closed up shop and went on vacation.
 Check Exchange, and sure enough it did not go through on the day in question, but on the day they called me. So it looks like it didn't leave the mailbox, went into outgoing, they prematurely closed up the machine before it sent and went home. I explain this to them, and they tell me that because they use a Mac, and heard the "Swoosh" sound, they knew it sent.
 Wrong. I have the proof that it didn't send. Here's the proof.
 Not good enough, they had me expand the parameters, check the system again, so I did. I humored them. It's then that I notice that the email had a second recipient: The sender.
 "Did you CC yourself in the email as well?"
 "Yes Mikash33, I did."
 "I see. Did you receive the email before today?"
 "No, I didn't."
 "OK, so think about that for a moment; You sent this very important email to them and yourself, didn't get your copy, and didn't think to check if it sent until a week later?"
 Silence on the phone. Checks watch, 10 seconds go by before I bust out: "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

 Imported with no errors. When I search for the name or IP using the search tool, it returns no entries. If I try to then manually add the name or IP, it errors telling me it exists already. If I try to add the name to an existing group object - it is not available to select. 
 I delete the entry and can manually add the Name and IP and everything works fine. CSV import would be great for 50 and 60 new names and IP's rather than the manual GUI host by host.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technology stack for quick reference, it is an industrial network environment:
 Serial Network (20 Modbus slaves daisy-chained on RS-485) > Modbus RTU to TCP Converter (Port 502, static IP assignment) > Unmanaged OT Network Switch, /23 subnet with about 200 devices total, mostly Gigabit uplinks.
 After several years of happy and uninterrupted operation (it is a Datacenter), the Serial devices being Mastered by the converter had lost communications all at the same time. Initially, a soft reset of the device had re-established serial as well as TCP communications.
 Within hours, all of the serial devices lost communications again. Several different configuration changes were tried to no affect. A TCP/RTU testing utility was unsuccessful in establishing communications to the slaves via the Converter (failed on handshake), but the Web UI for the converters was still accessible. Soft reset did not help this time.
 Ended up changing the statically assigned IP configured on the Converter to a different address, same port (502), on the same subnet. Comms started working, everything stabilized.
 It is still working but I don't understand why.

 I myself watched as the company I wrapped up my long career up with, a company with billion dollar annual profits, slowly but very steadily chip away at every benefit from healthcare to office conditions over the last several years. Looking back I was glad to have been there "during the good times" and was sad to see newer, younger coworkers not even have the frame of reference to understand just how much they were getting screwed and commoditized despite not actually being commodities. 
 In hindsight some of the primary reasons the company got away with it was their "thousand small cuts over time" approach, and the total failure of employees, especially the older and more senior ones, to collectively push back in an organized fashion. I'm not saying to Unionize (and I'm not saying not to, either), but it's clear that todays Fortune 500 companies operate under the exploit and push until something breaks model of staffing and operations, just as they do with most everything else. And if you're quiet and kill yourself to make moving that goalpost successful for the company, then it will probably be at your expense.

 I've come across a problem with our D-Link DGS-3120-48TC switches. We have three stacked together and I had set one port to a VLAN (L2 Features -> VLAN -> 802.1Q VLAN Settings) and also enabled the guest VLAN on that port as well (Security -> 802.1X -> Guest VLAN Settings), so that a device that doesn't get authenticated by 802.1X, it automatically gets put into the guest VLAN. 
 Now, I removed the guest VLAN setting and wanted to configure the same port to a new VLAN while also removing it from the first VLAN. This, however, shows the error "The guest VLAN member port cannot be configured." This only happens when trying to assign it to VLAN 1. Every other VLAN works, but I need the PC attached in VLAN 1 x)
 Has anyone stumbled upon this as well and can lead me in the right direction?

 I am working with a customer and am having an issue where devices are requiring a reboot in order to register back online intermittently. The devices are PoE + and require 30Watts to each one but that does not appear to be the problem as the customer sent back information that leads me to believe that cant be the issues (switches are definitely not overloaded). Below is the switch info along with the commands they are pushing to each port for the device before we install them.
 Cisco enterprise 3850 switches
 description **PA System**
 switchport access vlan 5
 switchport mode access
 no logging event link-status
 no snmp trap link-status
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
 I am by no means a network guy but could a standard QoS setting be causing a problem here? These are PA notification devices so they need to be set up to take priority over any other devices on the network incase of emergency. Could there be some kind of shut down due to inactivity possibly? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

New POS system at a remote location, network blamed for equipment going down for several days. Turns out to be a licensing renewal issue on their end. No apologies for their mistake. It ended up happening AGAIN at another location later.
 MDM system stops allowing certain IT staff to enroll mobile devices properly. "Must be something you did on your end" - ends up being a change they made on their end.
 SSO for a third-party app stops working randomly one night - "Must be a network issue on your end" - spend hours trying to troubleshoot and nothing our end changed, turns out to be a bad coding change on their end.
 Outlook add-in for large CRM stops working for certain employees, but not others. "It's your Outlook version" - prove that it isn't by having a user with access to all orgs try all in the same instance of Outlook. This is still a pending issue and can't get them to accept responsibility.
  
I know I'm preaching to the choir here but I'm so sick of it. Wasting all kinds of time trying to prove to first level support dumbasses that read scripts all day to let me talk to someone who knows what the hell they're talking about. Even escalating just leads to more dumbasses that won't accept responsibility for issues.

The only problem is the company that makes the software wants us to run very old versions of Adobe Reader because of compatibility with their product. I don't know if it's laziness on their end but not being able to update our PDF software is a risk on our end. I know the normal response is usually get another vendor, but trust me when I tell you this is not an option.
 I'm worried about PDF attachments that come through email. I am really at a loss how to handle this. Keep AR at older versions but protect against email attachments. Just saying it makes me feel stupid. I know the answer is "you want to keep a vulnerable version of AR but you want to security as well?" I hear you. I'm just looking for possible solutions right now. How would you guys handle this email issue? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not a cryptography expert, nor am I a sysadmin. But I'm playing around with PKI (mostly mostly client auth/sign), but I think a relatable example that most sysadmins will get is PKI use for S/MIME.
 Yes, you can pay $50/email address to some certificate authority, but many will also roll out their own PKI. It all depends on the use case of course, do you just need non-repudiation for internal use, or do you want outside recipients to verify emails.
 But it's 2023. Let's Encrypt lets you get DV certificates for free, but those certificates only support TLS server/client authentication EKUs.
 Why can't we have free validated S/MIME certificates (and other types of certificates)?
 Why can't we have our own CA for a domain, and have our "local root" signed by a "real" CA just like any other intermediate CA, so we can generate our own certificates that work on our own domains? Servers would need to also serve intermediate certificates that are under our control so the chain can be fully built since those links are missing in browser/computer root stores, but that's just a few extra bytes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've a 4 mikrotik CRS317-1G-16S+ setup, configured as two pairs of switches.
 Each pair has MLAG configured between them and hardware nodes are connected to one port in each via LACP. This is replicated with the second pair in another rack and then the two pairs have a 4 line LACP bond to connect them. All of this is a standalone isolated network.
 My hope for this was a complete redundancy with zero downtime, as our use case is really sensitive to that and any network downtime can cause major headaches.
 Overall this solution seems to work reasonably well and survives reboot of up to 2 devices (one of each pair) at the same time. There however often are small network down times of 1-4 seconds when one device goes down or reconnects after getting back up.
 Is this normal? I've not been able to experience these technologies on one of the more expensive brand devices, so I can't compare, but I'd generally assume bonds are meant to mitigate perceivable network down times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A client has 3 licenses of a software which are shared on 5 computers. According to the license it is ok to share those licenses (up to 2 users per each license), however cannot be used simultaneously.
 Obviously the users forget to close the software one they are finished and just leave it running in the background, thus blocking others who need to launch it on their computers.
 Is there a way to detect when a process has been idle for more than 15 minutes, so that we can then run a command to kill the process from memory?
 I tried using PowerShell but it seems that there is no property which gives how long the process has been idle.
 Maybe someone out there knows of a software that can reliably monitor a specified process for this type of scenario.
 Thanks!

 The errors we are getting before it hangs is: ID 129 - vhdmp and ID 51 - disk
 We have implemented the REFS fixes that Microsoft recommends to no avail.
 Nothing have been changed on the server since this error started to occur (it have been running for approx. 3 months)
 Some info about the server: Windows Server 2022 - updated to latest Microsoft SQL 2022 - updated to latest DPM 2022 - updated to latest.
 The DPM disk is 40TB and is running through Think system raid 9350 card.
 Anyone that can point me in the right direction?

 Fortinet 60f or 80F is what I've been leaning more towards. What are you thoughts? Price is a main concern for owners, but quality is most important in terms of up time. This will be self administered and i'm a techy guy but we're not doing anything fancy on the network.
 Just lots of traffic of all kinds, nothing huge data file wise, just mainly lost of secure web traffic for our cloud hosted CRM/ERP/ETC.
 Will need to add about 4-6 Wireless AP's throughout the building so also something that has a Wireless AP solution would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys
 I have a strange behavior with a system I added to my Windows Server Hyper-V Failover Cluster in Server 2022.
 The servers have nearly the same configuration - the CPUs are a Intel Xeon Gold and Intel Xeon Silver:
 Cluster with Server 1 and Server 2 (the new Server).
 Behavior not working:
  
VM is on Server1 and I want to Live Migrate to Server 2
 not working, because of "processor specific features" - but the CPU compatibility mode from the VM is activated
  
Behavior working:
  
If I shutdown the VM and do a fast failover from Server 1 to Server 2 it's working and I can start and work with the VM
 
If I do then a failover from Server 2 to Server 1 it's working
 
A switch back from Server 1 to Server 2 is working as well
 
When the VM is on Server 2 I can restart and shutdown the VM and after starting again I'm able to live migrate to Server 1
 
 At this point it's not working anymore:
  
When I shutdown or restart the VM on Server 1, I'm not able to do a failover to Server 2 (see behavior not working - processor specific features)
  
Server1 and Server2 have the same Hyper-V Manager settings and I already tried with a new, from scratch, installed Windows VM.
 Where is the difference? Why is the normal failover working as long as the machine is moved in shutdown state and failovered while it's running until it's shutdown/restart on a different server (Server 1).
 I found something about Bios/Driver differences but since both servers are not equal, I have differences.

We use a mix of VMware and Nutanix AHV which means Cohesity is out of the mix due to lack of full support for AHV.

 We already have Veeam so we know what that offers.
 Large Hospital and have about 1000 VMs with 150 Physical - more to be onboarded soon. Need on-site and cloud storage for backup copies.
 Has anyone used both Rubrik and Commvault? What do you recommend? I've heard they're both great products but Commvault is a lot more complicated to set up and manage.

The situation is that the client has a piece of software that is mission critical to be online from 10am-10pm, and the license key is currently a parallel key that is plugged into a parallel pci card in their current system. I only have a few days on site and need to find a workaround, I have that pcie x4 slot and USB basically are my only options to figure something out. Our newer stuff uses USB license keys and we can convert this one but it wouldn't get done fast enough.

 I'm wondering if anyone has tested a method to perform a remote wipe, as we've spent a lot of time on the issue and have had little luck.
 We've been using Graph API calls, like the one below, experimenting with different commands and payloads. For 90% of our test cases, we've had the same result: the system is partially wiped, with most of the data left on the device, and after reboots, the user is presented with a login to the Admin account, not OOBE.
 We've tried many variations of the API call and have even checked the API calls from the Intune portal using dev tools, but all our efforts have produced the same, unsatisfactory result. Our problem seems to apply only to Windows 10 devices. A few tested Windows 11 devices were wiped successfully.
 calls used: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices/XXXXXX/cleanWindowsDevice or /Wipe with different payloads etc. Also non-beta calls fails.

 I have an individual user that has continuously corrupted pst-files on his W11 device. Were others don't have (or most exceptionally have) this issue.
 After extensive trial & error, I'm starting to suspect intermittent internetconnection.Speedtest is pretty fast, ping is ok, but when in teams-meeting we have also experienced small hickups and even disconnects. So I'm thinking her wired connection is kind of bad quality, drops the connection, hence device goes over to wifi, and back, and back, and back. Resulting in Outlook to start flipping.
 Any particular application where I can the user have to run a log for a few days and see what's happening on her machine?

 I already made my first post with a question about MS Defender for Endpoint about a month ago, since I have to do a little Presentation about it. 
 I am facing a new problem, which I can't solve on my own (at least it looks like that). But now to my problem: 
 I want to know each possible column which I can get on Vuln. like CVE-ID, Description and so on. I was able to open a trial account with my student email and it works fine for MS Defender for Endpoint and Intune, but I can't get access with the same acc to PowerBi and to Azure. I used an other Account to get Azure (and tried to set up some test vm´s), but I am not able to onboard them into MS Defender for VM. 
 What do I need ? 
 I got a report example about some Vuln. which I can't reproduce with just using MS Endpoint and MS for Cloud and I would need a report with a few different (test) vulnerabilities, that are active, closed or in remediation with ALL possible columns. I tried every report feature in the application itself and I would like to know if there are more columns possible if I for example use the PowerBi Interface ? Its really hard, since the Documentation is not really precise in a lot of things like states etc.
 Sorry for my not very accurate English ... and also, if I did not understand sth. right - I am new in this field and not very experienced. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, just looking into an issue a client noticed on their RD environment and I cannot figure out what's happened.
 Basically 1 user has taken up 3 of the RD licenses (CAL's) If you open RD licensing manager you can see the licenses active on an individual user bases, but then 1 user has 3 assigned to himself. The only thing that stands out as odd to me is it shows slightly different uppercase/lowercase characters for each of the entry's. for example:
 CompanyDomain\joe.blogs - Issued on 18th may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.Blogs - Issued on 15 may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.blogs - Issued on 03 may 2023 - Active
 Notice each entry has different capital letters. this is a replica of how it shows in RD Licensing manager 
 1st entry has no capitals
 2nd entry has capitals on both names
 3rd entry has 1 capital on the first name and all lowercase second name. 
 They have 20 licenses in total, all active but 3 are assigned to this 1 guy
 user is only logged into 1 server at the moment of 3 RDS servers. RDBroker shows this is also the case.
 I can see in our RMM system they have more than 1 workstation. PC in office and laptop for remote working. Is it possible they've been given multiple licenses because they may have connected in from multiple workstations at some point? doesn't explain why he's got 3 when he only has 2 workstations if that were the case.

Latest is I've got a complaint on background noise in meetings which I argued I can't switch on teams noise filtering due to ongoing cpu usage. Told to move my office at home or tell my family to be more quiet. I'm at my wits end and looking for a new role as my boss is a cow. Today's advice from manager was to create a work profile on my personal laptop, as we all need to make personal sacrifices. Kind on makes me think I should go back to an MSP, respected in my last few. Maybe I should invoice them for use of my laptop?

I wondered if there are any similar network simulation quizzes out there for learning purposes? Preferable free, but i dont mind paying for it. The ones i found and where free to test are all like questionaires. But i would like to have this simulation style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week a department put in an incident saying an email was not delivered and because of that it cost the company a substantial amount of money and they are saying the email system messed up. The email SME did his research- it was Exchange- no external email. Someone internally email an attachment to a DL and none of those people in the DL claimed they received it, but mail flow and Exchange Reporter said they did. We were able to show who sent the message and when it was received by all the people in the DL which are internal as well.
 Fast forward to today and that department is sticking to it’s guns that the company email system messed up and the email just “disappeared”
 Really?! FFS are users this dumb? Not one but FOUR in the DL? What more do you want I thought? I was told by my leadership to find hard proof the message was there. So I did.
 I gave my adm account access to the mailboxes and logged into each one and found the message. The person causing the most stink- I found the message in their recover deleted items and it had been deleted four minutes after it was received.
 Now the department is blaming us because the file doesn’t have the right content- sorry that is not even remotely the IT department’s responsibility- please find another way to spin it how you f**ked up and don’t blame IT!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the clients we work with is going out of business, they are shutting down the tenant and getting rid off the domain; they are closing for good. All users have M365 E3 license and all computers are correctly enrolled in Intune via AutoPilot and AzureAD Joined. The owner of the company would like to donate all company owned laptops, so I need to remove them from AutoPilot and Intune. 
 How can I remove around 100 Windows 10 devices from the Microsoft 365 tenant? Keep in mind that all computers have BitLocker enabled via Intune Policy so I need an option that will not trigger BitLocker.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say your organization is multi-cloud, or in a single cloud provider with considerations to go multi-cloud.
 What are your present day criteria to determine where you'll place a new workload? For example:
  
Which cloud provider and which region? What are the metrics or drivers that will motivate you to consider more than one provider? Or a new region within the same provider?
 Is the proverbial "we always want the cheapest" criterion still dominant in your decision-making strategy?
 What will deter you from using a pre-existing region or a cloud provider, other than survivability and site reliability? Is it capacity or bandwidth, or could it be latency?
 Other than the age-old "proximity to the edge" or "proximity to the end users" that were dominant factors a few years ago, are there new emerging considerations that you're applying lately when deciding where to put a new sizable footprint?
  
I'm sure you'll think about greenfield (brand new project, no restrictions) vs brownfield (where this new workload has to coexist and work together with legacy infrastructure). If your analysis is made simpler by considering a branny-new slate for a new project, how would you approach it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: is there a setting for RDP that would cause a session reset if a file or type of file is copied through the session?
 Like to read see below: For some specific reason we use this, I am new~ish to the team so don’t roast me just yet, but I have been getting complaints from day 3 that this process fails. When asked if it ever worked I get a “yea?”. It’s happening across multiple different systems across multiple networks. The only constant is windows 10 is the OS connecting to the servers rdp session. All the windows 10 are a base image to a bunch of vdi pools, the servers are scattered across networks and these vdi are used to manage it all. The user can have admin access to one or both side and get this. It seems to be 99% of users, like 1 person can get it to work and it’s pissing his peers off. 
 Work flow User pc>vdi>rdp 
 Any direction would be appreciated I thought I knew terminal server until now!
