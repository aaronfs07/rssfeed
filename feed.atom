I got a new Internet connection from ISP A and they installed the Wi-Fi router. I changed its name to 'WIFI A' and pw to 'PASS1'(router access). My family was out of the country, and I had manually connected only 2 devices of mine to that newly installed Wi-Fi. But when they came back all of their devices got connected automatically without the need of entering a password. This is something new for me. One important thing to mention, we have a home in another city and its wifi name and password are the same but the device and the ISP are different. Is it possible that the devices knows the Wi-Fi router through its name not their MAC? And when it scanned for a Wi-Fi it got authenticated?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI, I work in a small forest equipment manufacturing company and we looking kind of CMDB/Asset management software but for to manufactured products. Preferable open source but reasonably priced (max 1000€ per year). There would be about 10-15 users.
 ​
 Basically we need able
  
to track all out product via serial number (or tag), find all related product
 add maintenance/change event to product
 find all product with certain attributes/value to send service bulletin to customers
 see product delivery date, warranty, options, change history of product
  
​
 Delivered product set could be like
 The broadest set of product
  
base machine
 crane
 harvester head
 measuring devices
 computer
  
Or single product
  
energy wood head
  
​
 I have looked asset managements software but al most every one is related to IT (Datacenter, racks, Networks, Computers, etc,). Is there general software where we can define product types/categories and dependable product and also customers?
 And yes, there is PDM but we looking more lightweight solution.
 Any hints where to look?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys
 I have an openvpn server set up on an Amazon Lightsail instance (London, UK) which to date, for the years I have been based in the UK, has worked flawlessly as my personal VPN, and has had a negligible impact on my download speeds.
 However, since recently moving to South East Asia, connecting through the same VPN is absolutely killing my internet speeds. This is a little surprising, as I understood that greater geographic distance from the server would increase 'ping' times, but actual download speeds should remain mostly unaffected?
 I am generally seeing speed test results that show connection speeds of ~40mb/s through public wifi networks being reduced to somewhere around ~4mb/s-- 10% of the actual underlying connection speed!
 I am looking at setting up another Lightsail instance in Singapore and cloning my OpenVPN files onto it. But I wonder if anyone can comment on why this is happening; is this at all as surprising to you guys as it was to me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be a very strange question for this sub but I think people who automate things and have technical minds (this sub) propably were in a situation like this in their careers so they might have experience in this.
 I work for logistical company and I have noticed that one work process which the operators reapeat over 1000 times a day can be done much more effectively by using the full capabilities of already provided HW. I am sure I can improve the efficiency on this process by 10-20%. I have even tried configuring the HW in a proper way in test enviroment. It works, now I just need to implement it which is quite simple.
 Since the business will now have a great improvement in this process these operator positions will be much more profitable. Shouldn't I receive atleast some one time bonus for the extra effort I put in this?
 BTW: I won't make the process easier for the workers, if that was the case I wouldn't be asking the question and just implemented it. It just improves their efficiency.
 The though of receiveng a bonus can't leave my mind since monday and the moment I realised I can do 5 step task in 3 steps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently entered an org with a number of Windows servers, and have been trying to get our licensing in compliance and holy fucking shit, why the hell is Windows Server licensed like this? Per core licensing because fuck you, a Standard license (for the entire VM host) only allows two VMs, but a Datacenter license costs an arm and a leg. Even with non profit discounts, we end up paying $4400 to license three physical servers that can only run two VMs each (and the physical hardware is running ESXi), just to have the privilege of working with broken software. What's that? You want to separate out server roles, keep things more separate, without worrying about re-licensing the same hardware twenty times? Same environment, 25K. For Windows Server. I hate monopolies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we are going to remove our line interactive UPSes on the second supply side of our racks and provide them with straight utility power to save a little bit of power (I guess battery chargers are energy hogs or something). I tried to say this was as a bad idea and I was told that the generator will only take a few seconds to power up. My first thought was about power stability but apparently the electrical engineers have no problem providing 80 volts to 160 volts and that supply should just work fine. 
 My opinion is not even being considered so I'm just going to do it despite my objections. I feel like this is begging for problems.
 I think this is a horrible idea but I have been tasked to remove the redundant UPSes to save on maintenance costs because utility power is good enough!!
 So how does everyone feel about this assessment. Is it worth it to loose a layer of redundancy for a couple hundred dollars a month?
 Edit readability.

 But I want something more, something that lands me in the 90k+/ yr salary, but doesn't force me to put in 50+ hrs a week. I prefer life than work.
 The issue is, I'm the main breadwinner of a house of 4. Wife works but doesn't make 20k a year. 2 teens who literally feast like Kirby. So I'm always living paycheck to paycheck at 65k .
 Current job is help desk but we're so limited to do shit, it feels like a govt contractor t1. Can't create an ad account, many things go to admins that in any other job I did, I could do. 
 I'm thankful I have a job, but I also sense they want me gone as I haven't had benefits kick in post trial period. Haven't rocked that boat because I don't want to be unemployed no certs guy.
 Ps: before you ask why no certs, I've always worked 80+ hrs weeks doing IT and instacart type shit. 7 days a week just to make ends meet. Still do.

The owner of a company has asked for a dual monitor setup to companion with his 2019 16" MBP he has. Long and short he liked walking into one of our offices and seeing how we had 4 monitors up on a stand all to the same PC and wanted some of that screen real estate goodness.
 I am currently stuck though, maybe because not a single person on the team is an "Apple guy" or something, but I have yet to find a Mac dock that does dual independent display (no mirroring) but also supports both Intel and the newer M1/M2 MBPs. The best looking ones currently we could find we're from Anker in the 775 and the OWC docks but those required thunderbolt to DP or HDMI converters too for the 2k resolution screens (TB displays aren't priced well compared to DP / HDMI ones).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked on ERP software at two separate businesses that was published by one of the largest software vendors in the world. That crap hasn't changed in any fundamental way since the 50s, no joke. They kept adding "modules" that you had to pay for which supposedly gave the software new functionality. In reality, they were user requested changes to code that didn't work correctly in the first place. Companies were literally paying even more money for upgrades and updates that should have been provided by the vendor. The software was so error prone and full of bugs it made me shiver with rage every time we paid the maintenance agreement.
 The money they burned trying to keep that shit marginally functional was appalling. Support was sold to overseas call centers which made even the most mundane issue a days long slog. They would always promise big new changes were coming and year after year they would dole out a new sliver that made the software slightly more usable than before, for a price. It was just a glorified DB with no real higher functionality. Data mining was an arduous manual process with no tools etc. to facilitate. It relied heavily on external tools for basic use including a gawd awful java interface that barely functioned. 
 It was slow, clunky, and contained NO automation of basic daily tasks. I invented multiple ways to mine what we needed and analyze millions of records for pertinent data. The lack of even basic input checks meant people were entering erroneous data on the regular that needed to be pruned, edited, or replaced. It became my full time job just keeping the wheels on. I will never work for another business that uses that crap as long as I live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm a sys engineer at a dental lab. We use ups worldship with crossware right now. It reads and writes case info to a local mssql database to pull in each shipment's info and to write a tracking number to the case in the DB.
 We ship a lot, 350+ packages a business day easily
 Anyone that has dealt with worldship, knows it doesn't scale well to this volume, but I've made it work through weekly db maintenance on the admin and various tweaks etc. So yes it works, but it's the kinda free program that isn't really free and when there's a problem their support is useless and one of the IT team has to stay late.
 So I'm wondering if anyone here has a shipping platform they like that can do all these things. Cloud and web based would be amazing as long as they can pull up the shipment info by scanning an invoice, plop it on the usb scale, hit a button and then it prints on a networked label printer. We are currently in one building, but we are outgrowing it, so the quick scalability of a browser based cloud app is desirable. I imagine the ui would be more modern than the xp/Vista asthetic of worldship too.
 We've looked into a few, like shiprush for example but, while they would work, they seem geared more towards Ecommerce orders and the onprem sql integrations are an after thought.
 So anyone here have recommendations for a shipping platform geared more towards manufacturing enterprises?
 Thanks friends!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone can help me stop pulling my hair out.
 My client has a SonicWall as their router, and we use Shaw as an ISP. Shaw called me last month and said our router is pulling too many IPs (~500) when we are only assigned 5. Nothing has changed in our configuration that would have caused this - I have literally not touched this client's network in over a year.
 So, checking their settings from the ISP, looks like:
 WAN IP: 1.2.3.200
 Subnet: 255.255.254.0
 Gateway: 1.2.3.1
 We are assigned the static IPs .200-.204
 Right off the bat, I'm thinking - there are your 500 IPs, its just getting everything on the subnet they gave me. Due to the gateway address, I can't make it smaller than 255.255.255.0. When I make that change, guess what? Now there's only 200-something IPs being pulled. They swear the original settings are correct.
 When I look in the SonicWall logs, I see lots of "failed TCP packets" from some China IP with a destination of another IP on the subnet that is not in our block of static IPs (lets say it is 1.2.3.50). Is there something configured in the SonicWall that is doing this?
 I told Shaw that their equipment should be restricting the IPs to whatever they give us, and its not my fault/problem. They came and replaced their modem today and it still has the same problem - pulling way too many IPs. Their next step is they want me to factory reset the SonicWall and set it up from scratch - no way am I doing that!
 Any thoughts?

 My boss says it’s vital that every admin who makes an action on the information system (servers, firewalls, switchs…) write every one of them on an excel file for example. He says that when we have a problem, we can look into it if someone made a change that could be the trigger.
 Is it just me or is it a complete waste of time ? Because when there’s a problem, I track it to the root to be 100% sure. Of course, I write down commands sometimes when they’re complex and I make documentation for me or my colleagues.
 What do you think ? Do you have to do it in your jobs or did you ? If some does it, which software do you use ?
 Thank you !
 Edit : we already do CAB every week where we discuss every change, plan the action and the rollback plan, etc…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody!
 It has been a while that I was asking myself how big Datacenter operators like Hetzner or OVH do that magic that forces the MAC address and IP binding so that if you, for example, change the MAC address of a VM you won't receive any more package, although having the IP correctly configured. Is that static ARP? Or something else?
 Second part of the question: transparent PPPoE offloading. Is there any device that is capable to terminate the PPPoE session and transparently pass it as IPv4 to my client(s)?
 Bonus: is there an appliance that implements both features?
 As you might have imagined, the deployment scenario is a /27 that my provider delivers over PPPoE and I would like to offload the session on a dedicated appliance and then bind single IP addresses to different MACs in my DMZ.
 I have a 2.5G WAN so target speed is around that but could have few 2.5/10G ports since clients will mainly be 1G.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm in the process of evaluating some access layer switch replacements for the SMB I work at. Here is what I'm having a hard time deciding: 
 I am looking at either Cisco C1000 or Aruba CX6000 48 and 24 port PoE switches. Supply chain is like everything else right now and lackluster at best. They are also getting pretty expensive. 
 I can find "previously loved"/refurb Aruba 2530 or Cisco 3750X 48 and 24 port PoE switches that support our requirements for about 1/5 to 1/3 of the cost from a reputable supplier. Cisco 3750X is out of support and the 2530 will be soon, so no critical vulnerability patches when/if they happen. 
 Our perimeter will be secured with either Fortigate or Palo Alto and proper segmented network design, and these switches will sit only on the access layer. 
 What I'm struggling with is justifying the HUGE jump in price to go brand new. Yes, I realize it could prevent a potential failure, but these are also Cisco and Aruba switches that will most likely last 10-15 years without issue which has been my experience with both brands. If one fails, I can stock 3 in its place and still come out ahead. 
 Curious what the consensus is on missing out on vulnerability patches on switches that are at the access layer? Judging from other threads it's a mixed bag, but thought I'd see what kind of discussion comes up! 
 Thank you!

 Tuesday, a close partner company had an email account compromised and phished us. Forty people clicked the link. Whee remediation.

Junior admin released the wrong email to a user, who apparently opens everything she gets ever. This was a baaaaaaaad how in the hell do you fall for this email. "Here's what you asked for, please see the attached document" with an email thread from two years ago below it. Fortunately, Microsoft Defender caught it and quarantined after she downloaded, opened, and tried to let it download the malware. My team kicks ass, we had it contained within ten minutes of the alert, then two hours to track down what the hell happened.
 Thursday, all is quiet. Time to focus on new direct reports, and put together a write up of Wednesday.
 Friday. Government agency that we have a required training with apparently glitches, and sends out a massive email blast to anyone who's taken any training from them about a "training booster 1 of 3" that looks like a phish but...nope. It's legit. With a sketchy office survey form. Queue our phishing inbox being flooded with 600+ emails. But at least my users are paying attention?

 The computer connected to Switch 3 port 47 does not get an IP from the DHCP server. I put Wireshark on the computer and see the DHCP Discover go out but do not see anything hit the DHCP server. If I manually assign an IP to the computer everything works fine. 
 A DHCP server relay is configured in Switch 3. 
 What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! 
 I'm reaching out to you as I'm absolutely clueless on what is going on. 
 I'm renting a colocation in a datacenter and have a bunch of servers connected via 10G Mellanox Connect X3 cards to a mikrotik crs317 switch.
 My primary uplink is a 10G SFP+ fiber provided by my upstream provider.
 The switch is doing regular switching, no firewall or routing rules are configured. 
 I started seeing upload speed issues on all but one of the servers.
 All servers are using exactly the same NICs + DAC + OS combination. 
 When running an IPerf test to a target outside of my network the download speed is sitting somewhere between 2-10Gbit/s but the upload speed is only at around 20MBit/s to 300Mbit/s. 
 But on one of the servers it works just fine and even the upload is at 2+ Gbit/s.
 ​
 Running an iperf test on the second port of the card (which is an internal LAN) I can reach 10Gbit/s both directions just fine. 
 I don't think the issue is my equipment but on the other hand I have no explanation why it works on one of the servers.
 Is there any logical explanation? 
 Thank you so much!

 Please help me understand how serious this is? What could a bad actor do who is admin on the device? 
 The vulnerability is outlined here : https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbswitch-session-JZAS5jnY

 Is there a way to remove their access to this computer remotely? We might not have access to run remote commands through the network to their computer (PowerShell, Command Prompt, etc.) but may be able to run similar commands through TeamViewer.

 His idea is to provide some high availability when one dns server gets down. I really don't know if it makes much sense as we can set preferred and alternative dns servers. I saw here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn593685(v=ws.11)#dns-client-resolver-behavior#dns-client-resolver-behavior) that a windows machine will take 1 second to forward the lookup to the alternative dns server, I guess a VIP will take more time to pass to the other server.
 Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I am looking for a solution to automate the process of onboarding new users (and maybe even for offboarding tasks if possible). At the moment this is the flow of tasks:
 - HR is opening a ticket with the new user's details (name, position, department, manager, mobile phone number);
 - we're creating a Office365 mailbox via the on-premise Exchange cp (it's a hybrid environment) and that creates the AD user;
 - we add the details on the user's AD profile (all of the above, they are used for dynamic group membership mostly);
 - the user is synced to AAD;
 - we assign the O365 licenses as needed.
 Obviously, there's also the task of preparing the laptop, joining it to AD and Intune and install specific apps on it, but that's another discussion I believe, right now I want to focus on the other tasks that I mentioned.
 So, any of you have some ideas on how can this be automated? I know that there are HR apps that integrate with AD and could maybe do what we need, but I have no experience on this, I wouldn't know where to begin...
 Thank you!

 I'm seeing a lot of posts recently about sys admins values etc, a lot of them seem to be in fairly similar boats to me (small on site teams for a few hundred users) and they're saying they're on $60k+. I'm in the UK so of course the conversion rate plays a increasingly smaller factor in that, but I earn nowhere near that.
 It's highly likely that these sys admins do a lot more than me, but it got me thinking... What do you sys admins actually do in a fairly regular day to day? I'm hoping it might give me some ideas of what I want to do/what to expect as I further my career. I wouldn't mind being on 60K either!

 My agency just mandated that we move away from the usual SCAP scanner and implement a Navy-written tool called "Eval-STIG". Eval-STIG uses answer files to provide justification for "Open" and "Not Reviewed" items, but the format of that file is bewildering to me. Rather than using previous STIG-generated checklists, it uses a custom XML file to provide those status overrides.
 Is there a document or anything that anyone can point to for me that explains the formatting and correct usage of the XML fields in that answer file?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, sysadmin in training here. As title says some of my users have been functionning in a very strange way. They have a shared mailbox which they CC on every mail they send. Team of 5, huge flow of mail. The result is 16k mails in 6 months, our plan allows for 50Gb of mails and it's already full. The apparent reasoning behind this is to allow anyone to access every conversation with clients should one of them be out of the office.
 Good Idea, bad execution they think mail storage is unlimited, and they don't want to delete old mails "in case", for now I set up an automatic archive but it's really slow and they've been complaining for a few days, some have the same problem on their own adresses. They're moving the mails manually from Inbox to the archive but that's just delaying the inevitable because the archive has a 50Gb max capacity.
 How can I solve this ? Anyone ever had this kind of situation?
 Thanks a ton, been learning a lot on this subreddit already!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello There. I have a client that i have never worked with before that has asked me to advise them on modernising their IdP. They currently have a combination of Active Directory, synching to AzureAD, but using ADFS for Auth. In addition to using ADFS for 365 authentication, they are also using several other applications (box.com for example) as well as using LDAP against the on-prem for some on-prem apps.
 They are eager to move to AzureAD (or another cloud IdP) to remove dependency on On-Prem.
 My thinking is that each app that uses ADFS is going to be handled differently. And that each one needs to be "cutover", there is unlikely to be any way to stage or transition from one Identity source to another.
 For 365 and Sharepoint and other MS Apps, i plan to recommend using Staged Mode, as they have some automation and workflows that have the expected ADFS webpage hard coded into their authentication, so i will leave the identitites used there in ADFS until they are "dev'd" out.
 Staging mode should in no way affect the third party apps, am i correct?
 My method is along the lines of 
 Enable PHS in ADConnect & Seamless SSO -> Enable Staging Mode -> Migrate majority of Human Users to Staging Group (I can move the Automation Accounts as their devs update the app to support this)
 The above has no impact on the 3rd party apps, correct?
 But what about if/when i change my domain in AzureAD away from Federated to Managed? Does that impact?
 Ive been doing a lot of reading, and seen plenty of people say that they read too much into this, it ended up not being as complicated as expected. My issue is the client has a large regulated workforce that cannot accept significant downtime!

 The event log shows: "The print spooler failed to import the driver that was downloaded from \\prt01\print$\x64\PCC\oemsetup.inf_amd64_a3d32de99448d391.cab into the driver store for driver 2507ci KX.

 This problem does not occur on the older on-prem AD connected computers. On them drivers are automatically downloaded from the print server and installed without issue.
 Why is the Azure AD joined computer unable to download print drivers from the print server? What do you guys think the problem could be? Any solutions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering methods to connect remotely to my iMac across the internet from an iPad Pro. Ideally I will avoid services that enable the connection via an unrestricted server (udp holepunch) even when the service is advertised as encrypted (so teamviewer, jump and even vpns are excluded).
 I prefer direct connections (ssh for terminal access and rdp for the windows but don't like the risk associated with port forwarding. My solution is to implement tcp wrapper on the server and either restrict the client access to the smallest range of IP addresses from whichever location I am at or each time I connect, restrict the IP address to my actual IP address at the time. To configure the tcp wrapper I would connect to the server using jump and then once I have configured it take down that connection and then come in directly using rdp and ssh (with access restricted to my remote IP address only). The jump “daemon” will run for 5 minutes periodically (say, once or twice an hour) so the jump connection will only be available within that window.
 In summary use the udp holepunch style services (jump, Team viewer, vpn) as a way of initialising the direct connection and as a backdoor route if I manage to lock myself out but do 99% of my connectivity directly. If I am able to restrict access to just the range of IP addresses used by whatever ISP I am coming in from, I might only have to configure tcp_wrapper once for each ISP from which I am connecting. If that isn't viable, I am cool with re-initialising each time my remote IP changes.
 I should add that all my important passwords are 16 chars in length and all have lower case, upper case, numbers and special chars so I feel fairly protected against brute force attacks.
 what do you think of this plan?
 thanks in advance.

I figured out how to semi-automate them in a month, and my boss got tired of finding things for me to do, so he put me on business analysis for our service processes and a migration.
 Three years ago we migrated multiple systems, our lead admin resigned on short notice, and I basically inherited his responsibilities over brand-new software and infrastructure. 
 Two years ago I got promised the lead job due, and a month later my VP-level boss got forced out and I was told 'you are a developer 100% of the time now, hand off all analyst and admin duties to....[null???]'
 A year and a half ago I got saddled with snd set up a new inventory system, migrated mobile to AAD and Intune, and refreshed 500 mobile devices mostly single-handedly, then got told to hand it off instantly to the help desk. No admin status, back to 'do what you're told' development.
 One year ago I wasted most of my time teaching other teams the basics of Agile, AD, business analysis, and got told I couldn't speak to other admins over Windows and Websphere and Salesforce because 'I caused more trouble by sharing information.' They replaced our business analysts and PMs with 'product owners' they scrounged from other departments and forced into roles they don't understand, and told us not to talk to the business or face consequences.
 Five months ago I interviewed for an asset manager position for $20k more in an entirely different department, got an instant offer, and my C-Level immediately calls to offer me the same pay scale and the long-promised lead position a day later, provided they put the job up for anyone to apply to. I explained I had an outside offer for double what I was just offered (but with way fewer benefits and leeway).
 I played hardball in 2022-2023, management got scared about losing me, and I finally got the job.

I have a CCNA and some previous exp. but Im no seasoned veteran or anything. I was told to document everything for an audit. When I get there, though, all the IT guy would let me do is take pictures/notes and would only give me the password to the guest wifi. I said this isnt enough for me to do the audit and he just kind of shrugged. His boss is gonna be pissed though when all i provide them is a rack diagram and a port map. They should've given me access to the corporate network if they want a full audit right? Im anxious the IT guy is gonna point the finger at me and say he gave me access to the server room so that should've been good enough or something.

The content will be available through Internet but only to those authenticated users. Currently we have an apache httpd with basic auth, and a ftp for users to upload the content to that httpd server. It's pretty archaic. Do you know any opensource tool that can deliver same thing but more friendly? I'm not looking for a cms, it's just to upload preexisting web content from different sources to a place where it can be published.

I see no reason to move to IPv4 for any reason whatsoever. Stop touching my cheese.
 I will move to IPv6, though I find the technical merits insufficient.

 This issue is not the idea of IPv6 (bigger addresses, security, mobility, etc.); It's IPv6 itself. I would move, if I got something better than IPv6.

 Delete and unset are valid commands on rommon, but both of these commands fail to remove the junk. I think the switch was saying they don't exist or it was read only for these variables or something.

 The son-in-law VP of Operations asked my new employer on getting a proposal together to see what it would take to keep them humming. Hopefully everyone wins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to apologize at the start if my question is overly simple. I'm self-taught in SQL and Server admin, and the guy that had previously setup the network I'm working on is out on medical leave (not expected back before go-live). 
 We're a small company, that recently decided to open a second location several states away from our current. Our current network is a 10.10.x/23 setup, with 1-79 reserved for static devices (servers, switches, printers, network connected manufacturing devices), and the rest as DHCP for internal and guest networks. We're very close to our 512 address limit. Our new location is expected to roughly need 20 more static addresses, and peak around 100 DHCP between internal and guest. My initial thought was to use the same DHCP host, expand the subnet to a 10.10.x/21, block of a larger range for statics, and expand DHCP range for the rest. 
 However, I get the impression that I can create the 2nd location network as it's own 10.10.x/24 range, and use DHCP Relay to enable communication without having to rework all of the local stuff. That should just require some changes to the initial DHCP, and DNS, but otherwise will all be configurable on the Firewall at location2?
 ​
 So in things needing adjusted in Loc1 (ex. 10.10.100/23)
 -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)
 -DHCP Host
 -DNS Host
 -rest of the network is no-change
 Loc2 (ex 10.10.200/23)
 -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)
 -rest of the network is nothing extra to setup
 ​
 Is this best practice? What other things do I need to be planning for and configuring before shipping the firewall and switches across the country?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. 
 I am bit baffled... I am doing some troubleshooting between my load balancer and backend server. When I perform a 'curl' from the load balancer, the load balancer sees "SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK" and then of course starts to push data. The server sees "SYN, SYN-ACK, but no ACK. It then does a retransmit of the SYN-ACK packets, and then gives up and sends a Reset. We do have a firewall in between, and although these two are in the same subnet (should just be switched) we see it hitting (the L3 gateways are configured on the firewall, so this might be expected). 
 What's more interesting, is I would think the LB should receive the reset and stop the data. It keeps sending, for a few seconds after the server had (suppposedly) reset the connection. 
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: After reading some replies, I want to clarify. By "support" I mean exclusively networking. My first "helpdesk" job I was in Wireshark picking apart VoIP call flows along with troubleshooting everything under layer 7 on a service provider network.
 In interviews they always press what feels like "so...what have you actually done...". I have never physically touched a piece of equipment outside of a lab, designed anything, or had any major projects.
 I feel like I need to take a step back before I can advance. I dont mind taking a pay cut. But what roles should I shoot for? Junior, Associate, Mid level? I even see senior roles that look doable.
 Note: I said in the title "near CCNP level". I would not be able to pass the CCNP at this time. I am not asking about certification, though. What I mean by that is I hold and am beyond CCNA in terms of being valuable in troubleshooting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: What IT position routinely uses packet capture, wireshark, and other tools to solve problems?
 Here's the scenario: the company runs a public facing website for customers to HTTP POST order data. This endpoint is restricted in the firewall to a known Allowlist of customer FQDN and IP addresses. 
 Orders from a particular customer stopped flowing this week. We reached out to the customer Tech Support for assistance, no response. After a backlog of about $200,000 worth of purchase orders had stacked up, I dug in.
 I knew that the customer's app was trying to make a connection and assumed they were hitting us from an unknown and disallowed IP address. Using Packet Capture and wireshark, I was able to sift though all of the Scans, bots, and other nasty traffic and ended up correlating inbound dropped packets to outbound confirmation requests (from other TCP streams initiated by us). The source and destination IPs were different, but both in Google Cloud.
 I took an educated guess and whitelisted an unknown IP Address and the orders started flowing again.
 Turns out the customer had migrated their services to Google Cloud and had not informed their downstream vendors of the change. 
 I love this detective work, using wireshark to solve these kinds of mysteries and investigating what is otherwise "invisible".
 I'm a generalist - a mile wide and an inch deep but have recently developed a strong desire to specialize in networking or Cyber. Based on the Task Description above, what IT Job Title does this kind of work routinely?

 A director has spent of time on Google and asking people about networking and is now convinced that this new office can easily be hooked up by simply adding a managed switch, directly connected to all desktops that will be in the office. This switch would have one wire feeding back to the main building (less than 100 metres) and feed into one port one of the current switches. 
 I have explained that this just isn't a good idea at all and that it would offer single point of failure, it likely won't be able to take the strain and a few other reasons.
 What reasons would you list to explain that this is a really bad idea?

 I'm a pro-AV engineer and we're looking to standardize on UPS units. We've been with TrippLite for decades, primarily using their SmartPro line of 1U units. They were inexpensive, and held up for the most part. 
 TrippLite is no longer selling to us direct as they are part of EATON now. and sales is through distribution like everyone else. This is fine, but with that costs go up. 
 But what about other brands? I see tons out there now and just don't have experience with anything other than TrippLite and APC (now part of Schneider). 
 I've installed a couple CyberPower units, and the first one I got failed in the first week. They RMA'd it and covered return shipping, but it meant a 4 hour drive to swap and swap back.. The replacement just failed again after 18 months (if that). 
 Middle Atlantic units seem expensive. 
 What's the verdict on Vertiv? I've seen them more than once in the wild recently. 
 Anything else I should look into?

 Recently got a job as a Jr. Network Admin where we own multiple locations that have several ISPs. Currently most locations have 2 routers, one for each ISP in use, both connected to a managed switch.
 I’ve been tasked with figuring out how to access the 2nd router directly through the web UI, as currently we can access router 1 over its web UI, but can only access the 2nd router through SSH after first using SSH to access the 1st router. What would be the cause for being able to access the 2nd router this way, but not directly through the web UI? Any tips on how I can make this possible or what to check on? I’ve tried finding documentation or anyone with a similar situation and haven’t found anything, and now I’m at a loss for what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 for a project I want to fetch various information about switches using NETCONF. For this, I use ncclient (a python Library).
 From what I understood, capabilities are describing which information can be queried/configured on the device using NETCONF.
 When asking for capabilities, I get an answer which includes
  
urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system?revision=2014-08-06&module=ietf-system&feature=radius,authentication,ntp,ntp-udp-port
  
This looks promising, as I want to fetch the currently configured NTP Server. Checking the data model I would expect to be able to use a filter like this:
 <filter type="subtree"> <system xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system"> </system> </filter> 
 I followed the YANG model for ietf-system from here.
 I was expecting that a device which claims to have such a capability would then also allow me to read it. However, the docs for the device just mention setting it via NETCONF.
 Now I wonder:
  
did the manufacturer of the device not follow the NETCONF standard?
 
does "being able to configure it" also mean that I should be able to read it?
 
or am I doing something completely wrong here?
 
 Getting all interfaces (from urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces) seems to work as expected, but for ietf-system I get just an empty <data/> field back...

So I have redundant IPS and firewalls (Meraki) in each office and I set up the IPS in an active-passive state for failover. However, during a recent network incident where my primary circuit experienced 10% packet loss for a short time, The wan circuit did not fail over (Expected behavior for meraki FW Possible to take up to five minutes). causing some users to be unable to access certain services for three minutes. I know that i cant control the internet so once it leaves my firewall its outa my hands but Having the ability to show that it's out on the Internet Via a dashboard is nice.
 I currently use 1000 Eyes with Enterprise agents and endpoint agents for monitoring, but these tests only run every five minutes and may not be the best solution for my organization's needs. (I could increase the resolution of the tests, but the tests incur licensing costs) Right now, with 1000 eyes, I'm tracking the availability of Google's DNS, then my three main SAS applications, and local network gateway. Additionally, while the Meraki dashboard provides information it is limited and only tracks The network device's ability to communicate to meraki, and not able to track access to services.
 I am considering alternative solutions such as PingDom to track WAN availability by pinging virtual IPs and reporting on SLA. Another option is to spin up a service in Azure, where I have virtual networks with tunnels to each site. By testing communication through these tunnels, I can monitor the ability to reach the Internet and end-point devices. but not Necessarily, the network's ability to communicate to my Saas endpoints.
 I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or ideas for the best solution to monitor my network's ability to communicate with the outside world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[currently sys admin for small business 150 people making 80k. alot of freedom, great job, only downside is 40 min commute.
 got a job offer for 100k, probably around 10k "extra" per year in bonus and stock options. seems like a job i would enjoy at a huge company with lots of job opportunity and its work from home 2 days per week, but there are 2 big negatives...
 it would be a 1 hour commute (each way), but only 3 days per week, AND the other big negative is that its a 4 month rotating schedule of first and second shift. so 4 months first shift (7AM-4PM), then 4 months second shift (4PM-midnight).
 ​
 what would you do??? 
 ​
 EDIT: im 25 with only 2 years work experience in IT since graduation. at a small company literally impossible for IT job growth. This other company is a fortune 500 tech company
 RE-EDIT: wow, lots of differing opinions. If anyone is wondering. I'm 25 with no wife, kids, or responsibilities. I even live at home with my parents still so it would all be profit lol. Not sure if that changes anything

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so we are working on a deployment plan for Microsoft Laps across several environments and I'm looking into some of the timing questions. I've looked over the documentation and the overall setup/etc doesn't look too bad and we will run this through lab/pilot groups of course. 
 My questions is, is there any downside to predeploying the laps client (prior to schema changes/etc)? Getting the client out is easy enough (deployment solution)... but like everywhere else in the last two years our workforce has scattered across the country lol. The deployment could take a week or two to complete and for some units we may want to be a bit more aggressive on the timeline to rollout.
 Also, any thoughts on this being deployed for servers? Again... this seems pretty strait forward assuming avoiding things like domain controllers/etc. Any other big gotchas we should be looking for/might see?
 Should have added...most of our environments are fairly simple domains but some are wide spread. In any case, I appreciate any thoughts or insights into this (even beyond what is mentioned). In any case thanks for your time if you got this far :)

I checked it out and it was just the lifters on the oscillating vent, but since we don't have a service contract on it and we've been in budget crunch for a few months now I just put off looking at it for another day.
 Came in this morning and the clunking sound is gone. So - as of this moment, the AC unit is both working ("alive") AND not working ("dead") until of course I open the door. Logically speaking I don't need to look at it - right? LOL.
 All kidding aside, the iDRAC controllers on the Dell r730xd's haven't thrown a temperature error /yet/ so I know it's still working. However, I know they're going to ask me to McGyver the hell out of that unit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks!
 I'm currently on a bit of a side quest for my IT team to explore the viability of shifting most of our org over to Google Meet to save some costs from Zoom. I can find plenty of pros and cons online about the general features and performance of each platform but I have a very specific concern about this potential switch over and that is the control and admin of the cloud recordings, let me explain.
 Zoom has a wonderful admin interface that allows us to see all cloud recordings in one place, this is used mainly in our Sales department. It is especially helpful when a user leaves the business, we are able to transfer all their Zoom cloud recordings to their line manager as we delete their Zoom account with ease.
 Google Meet seems to have a very bare bones approach to Meeting recordings. By default it will just save a recording to the meeting hosts Gdrive and that's it, no option to transfer to another user (i.e their manager) and no centralised control over these recordings.
 ​
 Am I totally seeing this wrong or is Zoom the clear winner in recording management with the meetings and calls?

 We have several iPads / iPads mini's, and I have several files I want to share with these iPads. Then simply open them with an app that is deployed on the iPads.
 We're using Lightspeed MDM. I don't like it. But it's what we got. I've looked all over the administration pages, can't find anything. Neither in their documentation. I would have thought sharing files would have been a more needed feature? 
 Anyway. Any advice? My idea was just to sign into a icloud on every device, but icloud seems to be blocked. Tried to change some settings to see if I could unblock it, but no luck so far.

 Environment - separate networks/NIC's, external switch not sharing management, different vlan. Hosts are on small isolated network while VM's are for intranet.
 Any tips on making it more secure? Shielded VM's are opposite what we are looking for as these seems to secure VM's from rogue Admins so doesn't look like that is an option.
 As far as I can find at the minute it looks like the only way to hop between VM and Host are Microsoft vulnerabilities, please correct me if I'm wrong.
 Else, PowerShell Direct, while I do use it I never had a concern connecting 2 different environments together, any concerns here? Or again it would come down to vulnerabilities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I'm working with a client that prefers to create independent shared mailboxes for every shared CALENDAR they would like added. Sometimes these calendars are created in the user's account and shared out. 
 I'd rather create them under one shared mailbox like "Finance" and have multiple calendars underneath and shared out so they can be centrally managed. Creating multiple shared calendars under a shared mailbox can be done in OWA. I'm finding this is difficult to manage, however, and these calendars cannot then be located in the GAL so I suppose an invite is required. This is AFTER granting the user full delegation to the shared mailbox and still finding the calendar is not visible in outlook 365 client... But it exists in OWA. 
 How does everyone manage shared calendars without creating a ton of shared mailboxes?

 I've made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications, aimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host their infrastructure. Because today lines are kinda blurred between sysadmin and DevOps I'm posting this here too hoping someone might find it useful.
 To get this out of the way - this course doesn't cover Kubernetes or similar - I'm of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals, you probably don't need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.
 As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We were staging our Fortigate HA firewalls for migration and had to perform an upgrade to the latest code 7.2.4. Before performing the upgrade we forgot to disable the NAT rules on the Fortigate which were running parallel with Palo Alto firewalls. 
 During the upgrade firewalls failed over and the ARP table on our ISP gateway got updated with new ARP entries from Fortigate (GARP sent during HA failover). And users lost access to some of the servers NAT'ed on outside. Since we don't have access to the ISP gateway to clear ARP cache, we needed to contact the ISP support, unfortunately no one responded in a timely manner.
 So the situation is that we need to wait till the arp timer expires in the ISP gateway and we don't know how long it takes and we cannot afford a long outage. So we had to fix this issue asap without performing a failover or any changes in Palo Alto to trigger GARP. 
 Then we found this command  test arp gratuitous ip <ip/netmask> interface <interface name>  which would manually trigger a GARP and it saved our day. It updated the upstream ISP gateway ARP tables. I know that we could do this in Cisco ASA and Firepower but wasn't aware that this is available in Palo. I think there is no such command available in Fortigate to manually force GARP (but I think we can set a timer for GARP in the vip).
 Sharing this as it might come handy for someone who ends up in the same situation as we were.

It’s a bit of a mess, I’m about to put a bit of cable management in to tidy it up, but see the server is inside the cabinet sideways with quite limited air flow. I’m looking to see how I can improve things a little. 
 I have a fan blowing air out of there which definitely helps cool the area. Generally if it’s a warm day I’ll have the air con on as well, the server fans will kick in if it gets too warm. Sounds like a jet taking off, lol. 
 It’s a HP DL380 if that makes any difference. 
 Would I be best to lift it slightly off the shelf to allow air flow underneath?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm in the planning phase of rolling out an OS upgrade (from Windows 7, sigh) for a small business.
 I've been talking to the software manifacturer company about the latest suggested requisites and they told me to go with either Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise or Windows Server 2019 (not sure if 2022 would work as well).
 The thing is that the software is multi-user using RDP. They suggested, instead of acquiring CAL licenses, to buy an RDP server implementation from another vendor (TSplus, never heard of that before) which is supposedly cheaper.
 That made me wonder if there are other alternatives (possibly an open source implementation of the RDP protocol). Windows Server is not really my thing (and it would run inside an hypervisor) and that's why I'm asking here.
 Thank you in advance.

 OneLogin customer here....
 I was wondering if you can still setup Conditional Access with OneLogin and Microsoft, if OneLogin handles all of the authentication requests.
 Currently when a login is entered at 365, it redirects back to OneLogin.
 If Conditional Access is configured (e.g. for outside the country) - would it still kick in regardless of the redirect?
 I don't believe OneLogin has this feature, so curious to know if anybody has set this up, and is it still possible?

 I've used the InstallSheild response recording function and that does work to create a replayable install. However...
 As part of the install it takes credentials (passwords) for some initial user accounts that it will create. I'd like to template the response file automation so that I can supply different credentials for these accounts during the build.
 The response file records these passwords as strings of the form !CRYPT!XXXXXXX... or !CRYPTEX!XXXXXXX... (where XXXXXXX is a long sequence of numbers).
 These data items could either be recording a hash of the password data, or could be reversible encryption of the actual password itself.
 I'm assuming these items are using a standard InstallSheild function to generate the values and handle the encryption/decryption required.
 Does anyone have any information on what this encryption implementation is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the past couple of weeks, we've been having random power cuts, after the first one, we noticed that the majority of our machines would stop loading any web pages for up to 30 seconds or so and then work again, but completely randomly, never all at the same time.
 ​
 consistent ping/tracert would run but pages would still not load. so clearly a DNS issue.
 ​
 Check the DNS logs and find that we would get SERVFAIL (2) errors, doing a packet capture would also show the same thing.
 ​
 We have DNS on a DC and all our machines point to that server for DNS, we also have another site with a second DC and almost identical site setup and they doesn't have this issue.
 ​
 We changed the forwarders to use our ISP's DNS servers instead of 8.8.8.8/4.4 , 1.1.1.1 etc in case we were swamping them with DNS requests, we have a lot of devices on our network so thought it could be a problem. Alas, still have the issue.
 ​
 We originally thought it was a Meraki switch that was causing routing issues, but it has been disconnected and the problem still remains.
 ​
 the DC with the issue seems to behave differently to the other DC as well, If I ping the DC hostname from the DC it will return ::1 where as the second DC responds with the correct v4 address. A bit of a google has suggested changing ipv4 preference over IPv6, but not sure if this is going to make much of a difference. waiting on a good time to reboot the server for the regkey to take effect.
 ​
 It could be the firewall, though I cant see anything in the logs for any DNS requests that are being denied.
 ​
 any suggestions on what the issue might be or where you might look next?

 ​
 As you know AS2 uses PKI to send/receive files securely.
 When it's time to renew the private key, you send your public key to your partners. That part is clear. 
 But who decides the actual point in time when the switchover from old to new occurs ? AS2 uses a 1:N relation, you have 1 private key for n partner relations, so switchover should be done in concert.
 But looking at my AS2 server (mendelson) it appears not to "try" to use its new key when a partner sends a file using our new public key. It knows both its old and new keys.
 Is this some RFC all AS2 implementation suffer from or just un-user-friendly implementation ?
 I have a hard time believing I have to send a precise date/time to all my AS2 partners to make switchover successfull ?

Just called our printer vendor, asked for direct replacement as I don't know too much about this I relied on their knowledge but I am starting to think it was a mistake, not sure still, maybe you guys can help.
 So issue is the printouts are smaller. They are good quality, not cropped, just downsized ~30% centered in the middle. This is a packing station, we print over network directly from SAP spooler, labels are .pdf.
 I tried everything humanly possible from direct import of the config file from other zebras to side by side going through both internal config utility and ZSU, gave it an hour or two of tinkering and then gave up (ultimately, barcode so it's usable it just looks funny and bit hard to read).
 So the main difference what I found was printer resolution. Old was 203dpi, new is 300dpi. I couldnt find any up/downscaling settings in neither of setup utilities.
 Is dpi the problem here and if so, is there any trick to upscale printouts with zebra label printers?

 The trunk that was working was 10G MMF fiber. I could still see the other switch via CDP, but no traffic getting through. I changed the SFP+ on both ends, and I was able to ping the other switch, but it was really bad. When I sent 100 pings to the other switch, it would timeout at random intervals. 80/100 success rate. The trunk link is at 10G full-duplex on both ends. 
 I tried 1G SFP, and still no dice. The 1G SFP MMF states were down down. So I went back to SFP+.
 I swapped the fiber from orange to aqua, and it was worse. With aqua fiber, there is no traffic at all, but CDP is working. I changed ports and still no traffic. I swapped to copper, and the same - CDP is working, but no traffic getting through. 
 The config on each port is the same. Upstream Switch (i think it is a 3850):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 nonegotiation  Downstream Switch (I think it is a 3750):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q nonegotiation  This whole time the 3850 led was green, but the 3750 was amber. Again, each link shows 10Gbps at full-duplex. I have rebooted both switches and only CDP is working. I'm hitting a wall at this point. What else could I do to troubleshoot this trunk link?

 I've been posting here before about an MLAG setup I did and I have some more questions.
 So I have an MLAG topology, see https://imgur.com/dRFkzAJ 
 The setup is:
  
Two fortigate firewalls in HA mode, A/P. I run LACP on two ports, port 1 and port 2.
 Two NK9 switches are vPC pairs.
 The switches are pure layer 2, we run only layer 2 on the switches (only L2 VLANs). All the default gateways are configured in the firewalls.
 Internet terminated in the switches. I do NOT have two ISPs, it is only one ISP that provides us two circuits or two handoffs that terminates on my both switches. They (the ISP) run VRRP on the router so my internet next-hop or default gateway is the VIP. Basically, the internet connection (setup) is a QinQ where they handoff two transport VLANs.
  
The MLAG…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit! This is a question for all you experienced sysAdmins.
 I am planning a on-premise server setup and have a question mainly about user management. This is for a future production environment. I am taking the sysadmin role in a small company and I originally learned computer sciences with a focus on application development, so while I know the basics I am missing a lot of experience with implementing servers. 
 What I want to do:
 I'll have a central Ubuntu server that runs as a NAS and possibly run VMs for workloads (simulations, renders and a database). I need to manage permissions for user groups and individual users. I also want access via VPN for homeoffice users and would like to manage a universal login for every user (would be perfect to be able to import these) and not have several logins. 
 I am aware of Windows Active Directory but since I decided not to bother with Windows as my server OS (mainly because of licensing and compatible database software) I want to do that on a Linux Server. 
 Basically I want to manage access so that only specific groups of users or specific users can access certain folders, thats the most important thing right now. There are aproximately 30 users but the number will grow in the future. Clients are all using Windows and if I could use the windows login as authentication for server access that would be perfect.
 Its my first time planning a complex server setup from scratch with user management, but I want it to be well plannned and documented, so any help and advice would be appreciated. I am open to suggestions about the general server or network architecture and the software I'll use, but my Hardware needs to at least host a NAS, a DBMS and ideally a VM.
 Please let me know if anny more information is necessary and thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 Here is a drawing of the setup: https://imgur.com/6iIYJ2Y
 Can someone please advise. We're installing a solar system at a client. Our solar network needs to communicate to 192.168.0.100 to get data from their existing electrical infrastructure. Their 192.168.0.100 is not connected to the internet due to security reasons, it's literally got an unmnaged switch with no router even, we are allowed though to connect onto that network as long as their computer doesn't have any internet access. Secondly, we've got a TV in the entrance of the building displaying data from the solar for the clients to see, it's almost a 800m run so would rather want to utilise and try to work through their existing network, running a new cable is very hard due to access.
 I please need assistance on how to get traffic from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.5 without interfering with their existing network (not sure if it's called port forwarding?). Client has a network engineer on site but I'm getting the feeling he's not 100% sure how as nothing has been actioned yet, I can hopefully relay info from here to him and see if he finds a way.
 Then I please need assistance on how to get traffic to and from 192.168.0.100 from 192.168.2.2 , is it perhaps port forwarding on the Teltonika and Cisco side? And then setting up a firewall rule on the cisco side to not give internet access to 192.168.2.2?
 I can, going to be hard though, run a seperate cable from the Teltonika straight to the 192.168.0.100 network and then the 192.168.0.100 network is not going to be connected to the Cisco network at all, but then I'll need advise on how to set up on the Teltonika side to not give internet to 192.168.0.100 but still be able to access it.
 Thanks in advance for any assistance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 20 years in IT, with increasing responsibility but still doing end user support, I'm not firmly in a senior sysadmin role on an infrastructure operations team. We're moving a government org into M365 and maintaining and upgrading other server infrastructure stuff, and it is sooooo nice having two levels of IT helpdesk BEFORE tickets get to me!
 Also, there's a bit of fear looking at new systems I am now responsible for running (Airwatch, eDiscovery and Purview, Security, etc), but then super fun getting to dive in, learn the magic isn't inscrutable, show my ability to pick stuff up quickly and contribute, share the load with my awesome, and very-much-more-experienced-in-many-ways team, and they clearly appreciate the value I'm bringing, even as a totally new person to their org and team.
 Not knocking my prior gigs. They were good, the teams were good, we did good work together. This is not a whole 'nother level from what I've done before, but I'm not out of my depth, it's just a bigger challenge and I'm having loads of fun in an environment that seems to really want its members to succeed.
 Also today I helped in my first real security remediation, and using Security and Purview audit logs I was able to piece together the critical info showing how the email made it to an inbox, and confirmed what data we need to do that so much more quickly next time. So I might be riding a bit of a high.
 Anyway, if you read this far, thanks. New job good, this day good. All good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently have a cradlepoint to connect some remote equipment back to AWS cloud. It works okay but not really a fan of the UI and the subscriptions are getting expensive. I realize there is a hardware + software piece here. I'm okay with putting together my own hardware - just need a good software solution. I've done a bit of research - but haven't found anything that sticks out as a clear winner.
 ​
 Key Needs:
  
Robust change management (file based so it's git compatible)
 Tolerant of minor config errors so we can still get in to rollback changes (similar to how netcloud w/cradlepoint works as this will be at remote sites)
 Easy button to VPN connect a local network (OpenVPN, wireguard, etc)
 Management of local WiFi interfaces on the device
 Management of backhaul (4G/5G) modems on the device
 Preferably no need to ever login to it - can do everything by pushing config somehow (centrally managed).
 Prefer something that can be installed on ARM, but X86 is also fine.
 Centralized logging/reporting
  
​
 Basically I'm looking for something that is always reachable via 4G/5G modems (assuming the network is up w/valid service of course) - and allows remote configuration of WiFi APs and VPN backhaul of locally attached devices.

 Thank you.

 The amount of negative posts though can likely turn off people looking change their career or enter the workforce from considering this as an enjoyable career choice. I find it to be very leisurely with rare moments of frustration or stress.
 Maybe it would be good to have flair specifically for sharing a good change or policy that has been implemented at your work, or how you were able to find that one person with vendor support who was able to solve the problem you’ve been dealing with for months.
 Alternatively there could just be a weekly recurring thread that just contains positive anecdotes.

 So, our git instances are VERY out of date. We're playing catch up on updates right now. It happens.
 Two weeks ago I announced my upcoming maintenance. I brought it up every day at least in passing to announce it. Explained it is going to take me nearly 3-4 hours to complete. It's just how it is. I told my teammates to let their pods know that I'm going to be doing this. I was very clear. However, an emergency happened and my coworker assured me they would have it done quickly so it didn't hold me back....
 Maintenance was supposed to start at 8 pm. 8:30 the pm they work with contacts me asking where they are. I don't know. I offered to do the maintenance for them so it doesn't slow me down. They declined saying that the person will be there soon.
 8:45 they show up. I send them a message telling them to let me know once they're done so I can get started. 9:45 rolls around and nothing. I assume it's going bad so I offered to help. Nothing. I contact the pm. Nothing. I wait a few more minutes then get a message from the pm saying they've been done for a little while ago and he's surprised no one told me.
 It's now 10 pm. I've got a long maintenance to complete... And I'm the Early Morning team (I start at 7 am)
 Thanks. Really. I didn't want to sleep anyway.

 Any advice or equipment do you recommend
 Case- Will be a Pelican Case maybe the 1525 or 1535. 
 Router/Switch Need help with this the most. I'm looking for the following specs if possible. Most important on top.
 - Compact 4/8port that fits in a case that wont generate too much heat
 - Fast start up
 - ipsec/vpn back to edge server
 - PoE+ for the AP but maybe i will just use a POE injector in the case
 Power- PDU with 4 outlets or 3?
 WiFi AP's- I have these already
 Connectivity will be from the portable hotspot on a Carrier SIM with an ethernet connection to the router/switch. I was thinking of getting a router/switch with built in support for carrier sim's but the cost is just crazy
 There's two ways the first one is the easiest but the least secure. But i'm looking to build both solutions 
 1) ATT Mobile portable hotspot as wan to a router/switch and the WiFI ap will connect to that. All management is done via the cloud. Easiest to setup but all traffic will be on ATT network
 2) Att mobile portable hotspot as wan to a router/switch that has ipsec back to our network so the WiFi ap will be on our network and we have internal monitoring tools and all traffic will be going through our firewall and filter.

 just wondering what you guys driving for a laptop on a daily base. I am looking for a new one so maybe I can get some inspiration.
 I am working in IT - Server management
 currently got a Lenovo t14 from work with their image so its not my personal one. looking for a windows machine with bright display and maximum 2560px resolution, bc too much is bad for battery. life. I want to be able to work a whole day. I know that's not possible but maybe there is a laptop for 8h use with simple tasks like surfing and doin ssh. Also important for me is the performance. I want desktop class performance when I need it for adobe e. g. and want to be able to turn off the GPU and use the CPU integrated one for maximum battery life... might need to write a script for that^^ Screen size between 14 and 16 inch. 14 inch is a bit to small for me but would work.
 ​
 Looking into getting the X1 Extreme from Lenovo.
 What are you guys running and in which use case? What are you looking for when choosing a laptop? What are features you need? (RJ45, HDMI, ...)

 I decided to do myself and this sub a solid and do a legit interview with this company on my Friday afternoon.
 HR and the IT manager both had cameras off the whole time, and the IT guy proceeds to describe their environment to me. He says they have over 400 employees, but “only about half” have accounts and/or computers. Patches and backups are automated, you rarely need to be there after hours, etc. So overall, maybe it isn’t on fire?
 Either way I received notice that I was not selected, maybe since I was firm with my asking amount. All for the best, I suppose, since I found out the IT guy is related to the owner, after reading about some of their current and past lawsuits online…also, they asked several times if I was currently employed, which is obvious that I am, and that seemed like a red flag to me.
 Stay picky out there!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little over a year ago we got a new CIO. We have only had one CIO during the entire existence of my employer’s existence so this was all new to everyone. We hired someone from out of state who has previously worked as IT director for a company about 5x our size. We are a medium sized company with about 5,000 employees worldwide. Up until recently everything has been business as usual with no significant changes. 
 Today I heard that a company called TCS will start supplementing our work to help complete projects and handle day-to-day support. It was explained to us that this will allow us to drive more strategic concepts and leave support. 
 My boss scheduled a meeting with me for next week to go over the SOW and the SOW was attached to the meeting. I looked it over and it consists of several different areas (servers, databases, VMWare). These are my key competencies. 
 TCS is quoting a yearly cost that is half of my salary.
 I asked my boss why my areas of expertise are subject and it was simply reiterated that I should focus on strategic work and let TCS handle the daily and we will talk more in the meeting next week.
 I feel like I may be in the chopping block but maybe I’m looking into it. Does anybody have any experience with this type of situation?

 I firmly believe that if you don't participate in these things and push vendors to be better then they never will be.
 But I've also got enough shit on my plate that I can't afford to waste my time answering nonsense questions with TAC or whatever, and I don't owe the vendors one half of one fuck.
 How about y'all? For example: I've got a batch of PA Firewalls that insist on doing panorama connectivity checks after I change the management IP (a fine idea)... but they start doing these checks before the new IP has actually been applied (a deeply stupid idea) resulting in those checks of course failing and config reverting, even with several retries configured. This is confirmed with ping and ARP.
 So obviously a bug, but also there's a dumb but effective workaround of "just tell the firewalls to retry EVEN MORE times, hur hur". Would you invest your time in reporting it to the vendor?

I have been tasked with upgrading the dated FI 6248’s on this network I am on. What I am looking for, is some type of upgrade guide on which parts should be upgraded first. Like, chassis => iom => blade? Or opposite? Mix? Or it doesn’t matter?
 I have looked online and I have been unable to find anything. Is this one of those “ancient networking secrets”? Or is that I am just a terrible googler(is that even a term??) 
 This is my first time having to perform an upgrade on the FIs, as the VM guys usually handles that. But, since there are no VM guys, well, you get the idea. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

 management api http-commands no shutdown 
 This automatically enables the API to listen on every layer 3 interface on the switch... EXCEPT Management1. This is problematic, because we use the IPs of the Management1 interfaces for DNS across all of our TOR switches, and using a spreadsheet just isn't acceptable in my environment. 
 Does anyone know a way to enable the API on a management interface? Is it even possible? I'm going open a case with Arista to ask about it, but figured I would also try you fine folks too.

 My ISP has suggested that I enable flow control on my switch, but my 10G link shouldn't be getting anything over 1G since that's what it has further upstream and downstream, right? Would flow control really do anything in this setup?

 The vendor is giving them a choice on how to earth the keystone panels. Their recommended option is to drill a hole on the floor and drive a rod into the earth in the computer room and bond all of the keystones to that. This coincidently is the most expensive solution.
 Their next best option is to simply run a heavy copper ground wire from the electrical system ground to each rack and bond the keystones to that. They say this will work, but is still vulnerable to problems.
 Option #1 seems like way overkill to me. 
 I'm suggesting that they not go with shielded cable, but in case they decide shielded, what recommendation do I give them about grounding options?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I received an email from my FS account manager this morning indicating that in the past year Microsoft has been purchasing FS equipment because Dell has failed to meet delivery commitments. 
 I know a lot of the users I've talked to on this subreddit have been weary of utilizing FS equipment. (Some due to TAA concerns, some due to OS concerns. (FSOS / ONIE), etc)
 But this is a pretty big move that will legitimize FS beyond just optics. I personally swapped my production stack from Cisco to FS around 2 years ago, it was an easy transition and has been rock solid ever since. They never have issues with inventory, I've received my orders within days, and support while a little lackluster due to some obvious language barriers is pretty responsive.
 I'm curious if this triggers any others to take the plunge on FS now. I'm also curious to see how FS handles the demand, if their supply is able to stay consistent, it could be a real game changer since Dell/HP/Cisco/Juniper lead times have been abysmal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys.
 we are installing a dHCI system from a client, and I'm trying to figure out what transceivers I need to order in order to provide uplink from the dHCI switches (HPE SN2010M - Basically a Mellanox rebrand) to the client's ToR switch in that cabinet which is a Juniper EX4600.
 According to HPE, the only available Xciever I have available which is 40G SR is the "HPE M-series 40GbE QSFP28 SR4 100m Transceiver" with SKU Q7F11A.
 The appropriate transceiver on the Juniper side is QFX-QSFP-40G-SR4.
 This is where I'm lost, the Juniper site clearly states that the transceiver lister above is MPO-12, but HPE simply says MPO - I can't figure out if it's MPO-12 in which case I need a simple MPO-12 cable or of the HPE Transceiver is an MPO-8 one in which case I'm not sure which cable to use because I can't find an MPO-8 Transceiver that is compatible with the Juniper EX4600. Help me, please!

Or was symmetric solution developed later that older solutions still use Asymmetric IRB?

How many times have I sat in a DevOps interview to be told I was the only candidate with basic networking knowledge, it's mind-boggling. Hell, a lot of people can't even produce a CV that's worth a dime.
 Kids can't use computers, and it's only getting worse, while more and more higher- and higher-level skills are required to figure out your way through all the different abstractions and counting.
 How is this ever going to work in the long-term? We need more skills to maintain the infrastructure, but we have a less and less IT-literate population, from smart people at dumb terminals to dumb people on smart terminals.
 It's going to come crashing down, isn't it? Either that, or AI gets smart enough to fix and maintain itself.
 Please tell me I'm not alone with these thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company merged with another one and we've been running two separate offices connected by IPSEC VPN. Windows domains with a two-way trust. The two buildings can currently talk to each other's devices as things stand today. Now I've been asked to move some (but not all) of the equipment from one office to another: VMware Host, NetApp and the ESXI switch stack. I can do basic switch configuration, trunks and vlans and whatnot but networking isn't my strong point. I know enough to hurt myself on the sharp edges. What I'm wondering is: 
 If the Core Switch (lets say its 10.1.1.1) is at Building A, if I move the ESXI switch (10.1.1.2) to the other building, is it possible for me to keep it on the 10.1.1.0 network and pass through Building B's core switch with vlans and static routing (Building B is on, say, 10.50.0.0 network) and across the VPN to talk to other 10.1.1.0 resources, or is it going to be easier to re-IP everything I am moving over and let the existing routing handle it? We're trying not to do that because a lot of their network shortcuts the users have are coded to the IPs and not DNS names. Which is silly, yes, I know. 
 Looking for advice as to what the "best" thing to do would be. And yes, I realize that hiring a networking professional is the Best thing to do, but there is no money in the budget for that. I'm going to have to figure this one out. And of course, they want it done this weekend.
 Thanks

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the ongoing ransomware campaign, known as “ESXiArgs.” Malicious actors may be exploiting known vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi servers that are likely running unpatched and out-of-service or out-of-date versions of VMware ESXi software to gain access and deploy ransomware. The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I was wondering if any of you have had success measuring TX/RX in LibreNMS for an Adva FSP150 model and if so how you did it, I am running firmware 19.7.2 on the Adva and Libre is on 22.6.0 (this is likely not upto date with the latest release, I'm currently stuck due to work change control etc....)
 I have Juniper devices on librenms where under health I have dbm which shows me the readings and graphs of the individual ports for TX & RX, I would like this for the Adva device. I'm assuming as LibreNMS identifies the Juniper as a Juniper but the Adva as a Generic Device this is why I see this difference.
 I have checked the definition and discovery files within Libre and Yaml files do exist for measuring the TX and RX of Adva_FSP150 ports. I took the OIDs being used in this file and set them up as custom OIDs in libre with Gauge selected and dbm as my unit, I do see graphs under customer OIDs but no data being pulled. When I created the customer OIDs I ran a test which said value returned & successful.
 I think my next step will be downloading a MIB browser and checking to ensure the OIDs I have from the YAML file are correct.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be most appreciated

The few computers they do have are in the offices, this is where the owners of the company work, if they aren't on the floor. They have about 7 computers, a small Synology NAS, and the new backup storage server.

 I'm having a little bit of an issue. We are getting weird network drops and packet issues and I suspect it's coming from an MTU Change
 we recently configured all our interfaces on our Dell FTOS Devices to have MTU of 9216
 via 
 mtu 9216
 Our VLAN Interfaces and Port Channels do not have any MTU statements. Currently our ESXI Boxes are now showing less than ideal performance and acting as if there is a performance drop via network (pings randomly dropping for 10 seconds at a time under load). The ESXI Boxes have vSwitches set at 9000 which is their max.
 I noticed their may be an ip mtu config. Would this also need to be set?

 Any Advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Was wondering if anyone has completed a one-drive migration using Migration Manager. I've done a test migration with one user, however it seems to have migrated all the data to the root of OneDrive and not within the folders I'd like.
 CSV file is configured as follows
 Column A has the data source Column B,C not filled in as not required for onedrive Column D has the email address for the onedrive user Column E has the folders. I've done this for each folder I would like to move, Pictures, Desktop, Documents so three columns for each.
 Column F I have the same as column E thinking it would put whatever was in the pitures to pictures in onedrive ect.
 ​
 Any help would be great, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just moved from tier II to system admin for a small company. To say I’m a little overwhelmed is an understatement but I think that’s how it goes. Anyway I have a pretty serious problem I think and would def appreciate some advice. 
 So the company I’m working for conducts certification training and has 100 or so workstations (split between 15 corporate employees and 85 student computers). Every computer has windows 10 enterprise installed but I have no clue where the licensing information is. The computers are also so old there’s no original license key burned into the motherboard. The admin who set this all up died and his replacement was clueless. When a computer needed to be reimaged he used keys from visual studio :( (all I can do is put a sad face here). 
 So here’s my question, am I right to assume that I would need to contact a license broker and purchase a windows 10 pro volume OEM license? Does anyone have any idea how much that might cost for 100 computers? 
 Also, I think enterprise would be better for the corporate employees. We already have E3 licenses and are a silver partner with Microsoft. Once there’s a legit windows installation and the machine is added in azure I think that would check that block, but would there be any reason to also upgrade student computer from pro to enterprise (I don’t think so)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just looking to replace some aging ASR1002 routers. We use this for eBGP and with the routing table nearing 1 million routes we need to either start filtering routes or preferably replacing them with hardware which can cope with much more routes. 
 As part of this upgrade we are also looking to increase the transit links from 10Gb links to 100Gb links as well as any uplinks to our core. 
 At the moment we have several transits coming in so we want to look at potentially having two transits per router so that's 2 x 100Gb and then we also want dual uplinks for reslience so 4 x 100Gb in total. 
 Unfortunately this takes the C8500-12X4QX out of the picture as it won't support 4 x 100Gb links. 2 x 100Gb + 1 40Gb would be fine but not more than 240Gb in enabled links. 
 So the next model up would be the C8500-20x6C. This has 6 x 100Gb links which can all be enabled. However the caveat is that this is coming in at £250,000 which includes a £190,000 discount. Ouch! 
 Unfortunately I do have to stick with Cisco for this. We do have other DC's with Juniper but in this case it HAS to be Cisco. 
 I'm wondering if I should instead be looking at the ASR9000 range or if the price point of that is also going to be just as ridiculous? 
 To give an idea of what Juniper is charging for their MX204 which can handle 4 x 100Gb we were recently quoted £38,000 which includes the perpetual licensing. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've setup Microsoft 365 Defender Outgoing Anti-spam policies per Microsoft's recommendations.
  
"Restrict sending to external recipients (per hour)" is set to 500.
 
"Maximum recipient limit per day" is set to 1000
 
"Over limit action" is set to "Restrict the user from sending mail"
 
 Yesterday the Policy triggered, and the User got blocked.
 The "High-severity alert: User restricted from sending email" said
  
User name@domain.dom has sent 35 internal and 342 external recipients in the last day, exceeding their External limit"
  
So why was the Policy triggered, and the User blocked?
 This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, on 2 different MS Tenants.
 I've checked that no other policies are in effect.
 The user in question made a mail with more than a hundred Recipients and that mail had an empty Subject Line (yep!)
 Theory: Microsoft has an extra set of (not visible) policies that might trigger before the limits we have defined, is reached.
 Any other ideas?

 It's all working great, but I'm not sure how best to go about granting the app access.
 I've created a new SQL user on the database with read only access, is that right? I've noticed it's also appeared under security/users and I can use it to login with SSMS?
 Just want to ensure I'm doing the right thing here.

 Nothing advanced, just something very simple to say Engineer A and B will be doing 1-2-3 tomorrow at 12pm.

 They only have 2 office workers who will be doing the project management and both have Business Premium.
 They will be doing the project managment for about 15 engineers, although non of them actually need to access planner or get any notifications.
 So my question is, can they use unlicensed users to add them into planner (More for a visual aid than anything else) or would they need to purchase a license of some sort?

 Edit: to avoid confusion, i'm talking about Tasks by Planner" integrated in Teams.

 We're using SSL certs on our (mainly microsoft) systems, currently at 400+ servers. We have a mix of internet registered wildcard, and local generated. The certs are for use with either web based systems, or some custom applications and RDP.
 At the moment this is a manual process and we really need some monitoring to email alert us in advance of expiry. An additional preference if possible is the tool to also allow us to renew the cert.
 Does anyone have any suggestions? 
 One requirement is we need to download and host the application internally. We don't host systems for external use so will not permit a web based SSL monitor (such as Dotcom-monitor) inbound access.
 Preferably a windows based app, but if it needs to run on Linux, I'm sure I can convice our manager that needs to happen. I've found one script on an MS site, but this requires plugins and scripitng knowledge, which I'm not familiar with, but could follow instructions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m the only sys-admin of a small but growing 25 person engineering company and I’m thinking about implementing a ticket system but I’m not sure if it’s beneficial.
 I only get two or three user problems per day but I don’t like how the users throw me out of my focus by chatting me up in Teams or calling me and expecting me to answer immediately just to fix the smallest of problems. The company is also trying to hire additional employees and I think it may be important to get another IT person soon. So all in all I do see a ticket system as an improvement.
 The problem is that my boss or anyone else in this company doesn’t know anything about IT and he doesn’t understand that I’m doing more than just fixing the users outlook problems because he just sees everything running fine and doesn’t know what goes into that. Because of that I fear that him seeing only a few support tickets coming in per day will lead him to believe that I don’t work enough. In reality I’m both trying to fix everything my predecessor implemented badly and without any documentation while keeping everything running and researching into improvements. But that can’t be put into tickets he can track.
 Would you recommend a full ticket system like Freshdesk in this situation? I thought about just creating a shared support mailbox instead so he at least doesn’t get statistics and I still get less distractions but maybe I’m better off with the status quo?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I'm currently starting to plan migrating around 60 CentOS 8 Stream servers as they'll reach EOL next year. 
 I've done a test run with CentOS 9 Stream, but I've ran into quite a bit of problems that would require rather large changes to our "way of doing things". 
 I've looked into alternatives for CentOS Stream 8, and what first came to mind was Rocky Linux 8 and so far it looks promising - especially the EOL in 2029 - but I'm not sure if I want to commit to it. 
 Has anyone of you switched away from CentOS 8 Stream to Rocky Linux? If so, did you stumble upon something unexpected? Any other Distros you would recommend checking out? 
 Thanks for your time!

 I seem to recall at some point someone on this sub finding the culprit but my search here is failing me. So I was wondering if someone here either went through this before and found the answer, or can help direct me how to troubleshoot something like this.
 So far all I've been doing is disabling background services like Google Drive one by one until it eventually stops, but there's a theory that it's our network shares or VPN causing it.
 It's only happening to one of the five computers we're currently testing on Win 11, so I'm half tempted to just format as well. But I'd rather figure out the real cause...

 We just recently updated our IT charter and wanted to know how other companys deal with users signing them.
 HR doesn't want to get involved in the process, not even during the hiring workflow. So obviously IT has to find a way.
 I thought about simply sending an email to all our users with the pdf attached accompanied with a "how to insert esignature on a document", but i feel the process will be too tedious for the users and obviously for the IT team especially on the storage of these documents.
 Do any of you guys use an electronic document management system, to store and provide pdf files so that authenticated users (through LDAP or AD) can digitally sign documents ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following scenario: 6 subsidiaries, 3 exchange servers (different sites) in DAG (1 witness), 250 users and on-prem AD.
 The plan is to migrate on-prem exchange to exchange online and decommission on-prem exchange after migration if possible. We also want to sync the user password hashes to MS365 and use our on-prem AD.
 Cutover migration is not an option for me cause of the 6 subsidiaries, so I think exchange hybrid is the way to go. I read many articles and MS pages but still having questions regarding minimal vs full hybrid: 
 - Why arent users manageable via on-prem ad using minimal hybrid? Is there a way to accomplish using minimal hybrid and on-prem ad and password sync? 
 - Why minimal hybrid should be used for a couple of weeks and not in long term? If all users are migrated, I dont have the problems with free/busy sharing and so on.
 - Modern vs classic auth, what to use?
 According to my current state of knowledge I would do the following.
 1: Change UPNs (.local domain)
 2: IDfix
 3: AAD connect
 4: Full hybrid
 5: Move mailboxes to MS365
 6: Install management exchange 2019
 7: Decommission exchange 2013 dag

 The Servers run Vmware 8.0 and have been firmware upgraded.
 Switches are WS-C2960X-24TD-L running IOS 15.2(7)E4
 ​
 We are not getting any link lights or connections with the DAC cables, we have tried:
  
FS.com SFP+ Cable
 Aruba genuine SFP+ cable
 3rd Party "Cisco compatible" SFP+ cable
  
​
 We have tried all variations of different NIC ports, different Servers and switch ports.
 ​
 The below commands have been run on the Cisco to allow 3rd party DACs:
 service unsupported-transceiver
 and
 no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid
 ​
 I will update the post later with output from the switch CLI, but suffice to say we can't get a link, from the Server side all we can see is a "disconnected" state. We can't see any obvious licensing errors on the switches (its on "Lan base" from memory?)
 ​
 We also tried connecting a Windows DL380 Gen10 Server with different 10Gb NICs and this also didn't work.
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 Probably our next idea once we re-group is to install a loaner Aruba 10Gb switch and see if we can get Server connectivity to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rant time. So for those who don't know, they decided to get on the cloud train. The server version of popular products like Confluence and Jira are no longer to be sold and everyone has to join them in the cloud. Shouldn't be a problem, right? Both are server-driven products that are displayed in web browsers. I bet the interfaces are identical. 
 WRONG, SCRUB! They split the code bases and the products barely resemble each other. Whole layout and functionality is different. And boy do they know how to screw things up. 
 Like the multimedia macro? Tough luck. It's been removed from cloud. So if you, say, migrate a server site with videos to the cloud all your multimedia macros are broken. Ok, so how do you link the uploaded video on the page back to the page? See, if you had the multimedia macro you'd just put the macro on the page and select the video. 
 Well, what you do is you download the videos to your hard drive and then drag and drop them back to the site and then delete the duplicate videos that are now attached.
 Seriously? Did I get this wrong or is this the official answer coming from support? 
 Official answer. There's two feature requests related to fixing this feature gap, one is from 2018 and the other from 2019. 
 And that's how it goes. Plenty of feature requests out there and if you think anything's going to happen on them then I've got swampland in Florida to sell you. 
 This is an incredibly frustrating trend in software these days. They'll switch to a monthly payment model and just stop working on the product, content to milk the existing user base until they leave for sheer frustration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seems like all hell broke loose today. I have a fleet of users with ubuntu linux laptops (ranges from 18.04 - 22.04) that have been on GlobalProtect for a while now. We included 6.0.4.something in our internal repo and installing the GP_UI package is part of our standard ubuntu image. LDAP auth on the backend because Palo/OpenConnect and SAML have been a moving disaster for years...
 Today, a huge uptick in users reporting that GP client is failing a FIPS initialization. No changes to the portal or gateways, and my environment is not FIPS. Windows clients are still fine, only linux users are getting the error as of today.
 The workaround is to remove and re-install the package, and is working for these users. I was wondering if anyone else with Palo Alto GlobalProtect has seen a notable increase in users with FIPS init failure errors.
 I have opened a case with Palo as well as collected user debug logs. But, because linux has never been a priority for Palo, I'm not holding my breath. This will probably turn in to a post about how PaloAlto should drop linux all together, but for now, I'd like to find out WHY? Did Ubuntu depreciate a SSL version that PanGP uses?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently had OSPF go down between an edge Palo Alto and a Cisco core switch. 
 No changes were made to either device as far as I can tell. Logs show no commits on the PA and no config changes to the Cisco switch (HA Pair)
 after some investigation I get:
  
ECHANGE to DOWN, Neighbor Down : Too many retransmission
  
found a few articles on both Cisco and PA side, both pointing to either MTU issue or Packet loss
  
Packet loss is unlikely: 1000 pings from OSPF interfaces 0% loss, <2ms average latency. They are directly connected
  
Some further debugging:
  
I can see the Adjacency process begin and the DBD packets transmit 
 I can see the VlXX OUT to the PA 
 I can see the VlXX IN from the PA 
 OUT packet len:1412 
 MTU on the router interface is 1500, verified by ping sweep 
 I can see the packets retransmit until they hit 25 where it is killed due to excessive retransmission 
 IN packets still come but are ignored for a timer until process repeats
  
So that size 1412 shouldn't get fragmented correct? 
 One other thing I noticed is that on the HA Pair, all the Vlan interfaces are setup HSRP, except the one facing the PAs. For whatever reason, those vlan interfaces are setup separate i.e. VlanXX x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2 with no standby... 
 oddly after the Neighbor exchange goes down, I see a new election between the two devices but using other HSRP Vlan interfaces, but over the OSPF VlanXX already in process. This setup seems really odd to me? Could it cause issues?
 It's been a while since I went really deep into OSPF troubleshooting so I'm at a little bit of a loss of where to go next. I can't find any other errors on the PA or Cisco devices other than the constant retransmission/kill loop.

No fiber or copper connections available so reliant on LTE until these get put in towards the end of the constructions site's life. Hoping to achieve LTE router in a bridge/ modem mode to a UDM Pro downstream (business uses a Unifi network stack, affordable, standadized). 
 I am trying to get a Teltonika RUTXR1 to successfully bridge, or passthrough, it's WAN IP address to a UDM Pro. The Telonika has two SIM WAN interfaces (one EE, one O2), both interfaces are set to passthrough mode and the UDM Pro is set to DHCP for on it's WAN interface. 
 In bridge mode, the Teltonika is no longer accessible (as expected) however, the UDM Pro also does not get the WAN IP address and says that there is no internet connection.
 In passthrough mode the Teltonika is still accessible/ manageable through it's remote management system (as expected), the UDM Pro is adoptable onto the Unifi system and can be remotely managed. However, it's WAN IP address in the Unifi console is a private 192.168.1.x IP address and not the WAN IP the Teltonika has. Laptops connected to the UDM Pro also have no WAN connectivity even though the UDM can get firmware updates and be remotely managed.
 Where am I going wrong? Why does the UDM Pro have some connectivity in pass through mode but absolutely zero in bridge mode? 
 Is it CGNAT causing the issue? Is it a NAT or firewall issue on the Teltonika? The whitepapers state that all routing, NAT and firewall functionality are disabled in bridge mode (as expected) so, seems unlikely?

 For our non-revenue-generating R&D lab, we've been using the Cisco Small Business line of switches (SG350XG-24T, and SG550XG-24T) for 10GbT ToR switches. They have performed well for us over the years. Now I see that the Cisco Small Business (i.e., Linksys-heritage) line is now no longer being produced, and now it's the "Cisco Business" line for SME networking. Looks like the "Cisco Business 350-24XT Managed Switch" would be the closest model as compared to what we've bought in the past; I have a few questions...
 1) Is the NOS closer to Cisco IOS than the CSB line was (that was "IOS-like" but had quite a few different commands, etc.) 2) There's no "DNA" license BS with this line? 3) Are there other good choices for a 24-port 10GbT switches out there? We have been swinging our switching over to Juniper, but they don't have a good/lower-cost 24-ports of 10GbT model out there from what I can tell... 
 (And also, I know 10GbT is kind of a legacy port type vs SFP+, but that's what all their servers have in the location we're buying for, and what the admin staff there knows...)
 Thanks!

Simply, the company was sold by the owner to some employees, and ultimately the employees felt like I wasn’t the right fit to continue to manage the technology and systems there. Now that a year has passed I wanted to share some lessons and hope for the next person that has to live through something similar. First lesson, from before the firing, if you hear anything rumors or mentions that the company talked to someone about replacing you…rest assured it’s happening. No matter how much management assures you it isn’t or it’s exploratory or they think you could use help. You’re gone, start making plans. Second, the firing itself.

 I have a Nexus 9k that shows a different local bridge ID than what is the Root bridge ID. However, none of the links are in role "Root", and all other switches in the network have their root port going toward this Nexus 9k. There are no VDCs running on this Nexus 9k. And when I do show spanning-tree root on the Nexus 9k, no ports are listed as the root port, and the cost to root is always 0.
 Am I missing something? Seems like a bug to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started a new job as a junior tech hoping to join a more mature network and IT group. To my surprise, the network is a bit of a mess and it seems like network design best practices were not followed at all. There's also lack of documentation.
 One thing that's really confused me is the way Switch to Switch connections were done. The network tech created seperate VLANs for each switch to switch connection, configured the ports as access ports, and then tagged the vlan. As a result, there are 299 VLANs with most only being used for 2 ports. 
 ​
 For example -
 Switch A -
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/3
 switchport access vlan 614
 ​
 interface Vlan614
 description NCH-3
 ip address 10.2.254.46 255.255.255.252
 ip pim sparse-dense-mode
 ​
 VLAN Name Status Ports
 ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
 614 NCH3-NCH1 active Te1/3
 ​
 Switch B -
 interface GigabitEthernet1/1/1
 switchport access vlan 614
 ​
 interface Vlan614
 ip address 10.2.254.45 255.255.255.252
 ip pim sparse-dense-mode
 ​
 VLAN Name Status Ports
 ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
 614 NCH3-NCH1 active Gi1/1/1, Gi1/1/3, Gi1/1/4, Te1/1/1, Te1/1/2
 ​
 I'm a junior tech so this has really confused me. I always thought that you want switch to switch connections configured as Trunk. What would be the best way to correct something like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[7(?) years into my career and I've finally reached the point of burn out. My previous role nearly reached the same point, but I left before I got to that.
 It's been brewing in me for some months now, managed to get a pay rise in the summer (but IT pay in the UK is dogshit anyway). The userbase we support is increasing, but we're horrendously understaffed, no time to research new technologies, we're locked in with garbage fucking systems because somehow it's not our decision. Somehow spend more time doing what should be a dedicated first line support's job, instead of doing actual system infrastructure maintenance. Sales guy is letting small clients set up BYOD systems and then trying to impose lockdowns on their personal devices, including using Intune/Endpoint Manager with a bunch of fucking Macbooks, then coming to me for help (spoiler: I can't)
 But yesterday, I had the full blown meltdown. Simple task, user needs printer/scanner installing. It's an older HP so probably won't be too much of a bastard to sort. Log on, no admin access for some reason, looks like Intune hadn't been applying the settings, and of course, Intune gives 0 useful information as to why. So it's possible the user is still an admin. Try to get him to elevate, he's not doing it and keeps cancelling, then he brings up HP Smart and disappears for 20 minutes and I get disconnected. Later get an email saying "all working, thanks"
 Just lost it. Why is such a simple task such a twat to do? Why is our IT structure so broken?
 Good people to work for, just not a good company
 Had an interview today, big pay rise, decent looking company. Stage 1 of 3 complete, finger's crossed I make it to the end (I won't!)
 Thanks for attending my rant, how's your week going?

I know type-2 route is MAC or MAC+IP, my question is what does it mean if a type-2 route has MAC AND IP vs if it only has MAC? Say , a leaf got an ARP packet from an endpoint and wants to advertise over BGP EVPN session to other leafs (via spine), how does it know whether to add the IP or not in that advertisement? I know, the wireshark trace shows type-2 and label[0] and label[1] but still wasn't clear on this. thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While changing internet providers we are left with the responsibility of sorting out our own phone line. As landlines are becoming obsolete, we are looking into VoIP. We assumed it would be as cheap or cheaper than landlines since everything is online and we buy our equipment.
 We only need one number, and several headsets that work in a hierarchy where all incoming calls are going into one office with the option of directing the calls to the other headsets (if someone is trying to reach a certain room).
 All the VoIP providers are saying that we need individual users for each DECT phone, to be able to transfer between them and to be able to make phone calls. We will need 7 headsets, and what is worse, 7 users taking us to quite a monthly tariff considering that we are not using more than 200 minutes/month.
 At this point, if anyone has an idea of how to set this up without advanced setup knowledge, that would be amazing. I am also happy to jump on a quick call, for a little paid consultancy.
 I've made a diagram of the setup I was thinking to get for the business which can be seen here.
 Any help is much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title explains, we just created a warning in HTML that our email appliance ads to all e-mail comming from all external domains.Which then created a shitstorm of complaints, and people calling us saying this is not a solution blablabla. And then they litterely starting to google random shit and add it to a post i did on our intranet explaining me what to do for cybersecurity. Like litterly telling me how to do my job haha.
 Context: We just did a phishing campaign run, which in our eyes was an obvious phish and 21% of the corrensponents clicked on the link of which 9% added sensitive information in a form and clicked on send. You can say that cybersecurity awareness is not a hot topic in our company which we are trying to address trough management and policy (which is going great by the way).
 Sometimes shit like this gets under your skin when people start to complain that massively shit can get to you. Which it now does.
 How do you handle these kinds of situations? What do you tell yourself, mentally?
 ​
 p.s.On friday my manager is going to share the details of the phish, and is going to say that "most" of the people that are now commenting on this implementation where also the persons that have clicked on the link in the e-mail. In Holland we call it "met gestrekte been erin" and in english that would be " With straight leg in it"

 I can get attenuators for 1-15dB. Some random online calculator shows that 10-12dB should be equivalent for 20+km of fiber so 10dB should be handy.

 last time we had a case in the company that someone was sending spam from our user's account. It was probably a trojan or someone had cracked the user's password. We know how to protect ourself against trojans and password cracking, but sometimes these situations can happen due to user carelessness. 
 What security measures do you have in place, on the antispam firewall or perhaps on Exchange, to prevent you from sending spam from your network and being blacklisted?
 I would just like to add: Sometimes our users need to send an email to more than 1000 recipients.
 Thank you very much in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started this role at a SAP centered enterprise and I was tasked with building a UI that displays and aggregates daily reports of some plant. Due to security reasons, the plants terminal is not connected to the web. The terminal instead generates a .csv report which is then shared in a shared folder.
 The plants syso wasn't much of a help in determining how everything works there. He sent me this URI that opened a shared folder in my work laptop win 11 machine
 \\hcldata1\hcs_fldr$\45-SOME-MANUFACURING-DATA 
 This opened a folder on my machine. Now, this is very confusing to me as I am a programmer and I don't use Windows that much. Who serves this folder? Is this OneDrive (i was told no)? Azure? How did I access something not on my PC without a proper URL/URI? Sorry if those questions seem basic. I am just a Linux guy so I am unfamiliar with enterprises that run on Windows products.
 P.S: Also I need to know how I automate a process that sends reports added to that folder to a remote web server written in Node. Not a tutorial, but more of a general direction. Like, do I install WSL and write a bash script? Or do I write a powershell script? Just a direction.

 We have 2 x junior analysts who are not being managed very well causing the issue to continue.
 I pitched a roadmap/development plan for the junior analysts which would involve them managing the IT assets and working alongside the 2nd line team.
 The response I got was ‘how much would you expect for the additional responsibility’.
 My salary currently sits at £42k ($50k) and while an increase in salary would be helpful I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot here and come across as greedy. Can anyone provide their thoughts on what they deem reasonable compensation (if any) for the extra 2 x analysts and implementation of asset control processes.
 Apologies from me if this is not the right space to raise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iam new to networking. So any one with proper knowlege pls help me.
 1.I have a dlink home router it's ip is 192.168.0.1. its dhcp range is 192.168.0.50 to 192.168.0.100.
 i want to extend the router wifi range and ethernet ports. 
 So I have another linksys router of ip 192.168.1.1.
 I want to connect linksys router with dlink to extend wifi range and ethernet using lan cable. 
 How to do it? 
 My instructor said to connect one lan port of dlink router with the wan port on linksys router through a lan cable and turn off dhcp on linksys router. 
 So you will get internet through linksys router. Is he right? 
 Then what about the ip adress conflict between both router. One is 192.168.0.1 and other is 192.168.1.1
 Both are on Different network. Does it works? 
 As per my assumption every device connected to router through the wired or wirelessly to the router should be on same network. 
 If it works how to acess second router configaration page.? 
 Because if we connect second router to the first router,dhcp server of first router changes the second router ip. 
 Then how to know the ip of second router? 
 2.Also I have tenda router. I want to connect it to dlink router through wirelessly. 
 It has a seperate wireless repeating option on configuration page. 
 On that menu there is 3 option 1.wisp 2.universal repeater 3.ap mode. 
 Which one should I choose? 
 Also tell me the remaining changes I should do on tenda router? 
 3.does all router have wireless repeatet option? 
 If don't then is any other way to connect second router to primary router wirelessly? 
 4.if we purchase a router for extension how to know it has all the function necessary for router extension?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've altered some information below and made it generic so as to be less recognizable.
 I was in a technology meeting where Really Bad Idea™ was proposed. At the time, I told them such and normally my opinions have weight, but this time I was outnumbered and they were locked in. Another in my cohort at this meeting, we will call him Mr. Z, is the kind of person who gleefully runs and does whatever upper management asks. He was as much for it as I was against it. So this thing got legs and ran.
 It's my role to sell some of these upper management decisions to the group, and do what was needed to make them successful. This time that wasn't possible. It was too draconian. It directly impacted people and their time. All I could do was offer some help. But I presented it as neutrally as possible so as not to throw anyone under the bus because it's just never good to openly do so. As a result they thought I initiated it, which normally I live with but this time was different.
 When the complaints from the field started coming in, people didn't want to say anything to me directly so they went to Mr. Z much to my surprise. Mr. Z then didn't own up to the fact that he was a big part of why this idea went forward. He just quietly listened, sympathized, and then went about his day. I know this because I overheard one of these conversations.
 At that point I called a WebEx with everyone in the field, apologized for the nightmare and the impact it had, and gathered data with all of their feedback on the recent issue. Everyone was 100% against it and all of the suggestions to fix it aligned. I then presented that data to upper management and requested to make modifications to the idea so it could work. It was more work to fix it but it needed to be fixed with urgency.
 This crisis was averted, but it cost valuable time and had an impact on my street cred. It sucked.

 I have problem with native VPN in both Windows 10 / 11 on domain computers (with roaming profiles enabled).
 After I create (manually) new VPN connection (in new Windows 10/11 Settings panel) I cannot connect to it, because it throws The system could not find the phone book entry for this connection error everytime.
 Funny thing, when I run old rasphone client, then I can connect to it without issue.
 I've even tried to remove rasphone.pbk file in user roaming profile (on server), but it doesn't help. It only works when I copy it from roaming profile into C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Connections\Pbk\... but when I create another VPN profile, then I have to copy it to ProgramData too, because new connection doesn't work...
 Is there a way to force the new Windows 10/11 VPN panel to use rasphone.pbk file from roaming profile, and not the C:\ProgramData one?

What advantages are there for one over the other? To my understanding the difference is that dual cloud will keep the spoke tunnel up in the event of a failed hub, whereas with NHS clustering there would be a momentary lose in transport as NHRP transitions from the primary tunnel to the secondary.

 The part I’m actually having trouble with? 
 I’ve been working on a script to re-do the user Outlook profile and completely log them out of office and teams and work/school account, saved credentials etc.
 Outlook works fine since I can pipe 2 registry keys for a new profile and then make it default on the next launch. They then get logged in with seamless sso 
 Basically a reset without nuking the actual profile.
 Normally we would use our vendor tool to help the users get logged in to the “new” accounts but of course this is a VDI environment and it doesn’t play nicely.
 I can’t get teams/OneDrive to log out seemingly No matter what I do to the registry or folders there in.
 I did see some scripts online but they don’t actually work lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a beginner and know enough about networking to get by, but nothing too crazy.
 With that said, I need to survey Wi-Fi at about 5-7 medium-sized buildings (20-55k sq. ft.) and install some access points (or in some cases potentially hire someone else to install an entire new system), then show some of the higher-ups the before and after Wi-Fi surveys of the site.
 I've been reading up on this, and it seems like AirMagnet and Ekahau are the popular ones, but dang are they expensive. At one building with 3 floors and 17 access points, it costed us around $2500 for parts and labor on a mesh Wi-Fi system, so we can't really justify the same amount or more for just surveying from our perspective.
 For this type of work/scenario, would Netspot Pro be fine?
 Let me know if clarification is needed, or if I am just way off here.
 ​
 Bonus:
 I would love to learn more about setting up business/enterprise-level Wi-Fi systems, what would be a good way for me to learn more? Like I see the backside of patch panels and it looks crazy, but it makes me very interested.

But they have been intermittently responding to payment reminders with excuses about how they are about to send a check. This has been going on for 191 days now!
 What do you all think about giving them a notice about limiting their bandwidth until payment is made? ISPs and mobile carriers already do this, why not us?

 we are trying to isolate residential networks from enterprise networks. Unfortunately, we exit into the same landscape (enterprise and residential). The question is can we use the following subnets???? Each house will be having roughly 10-20 (max 30) hosts.
 House 1 - 10.80.10.0/24
 House 2 - 10.80.11.0/24
 House 3 - 10.80.12.0/24
 House 4 - 10.80.13.0/24
 House 5 - 10.80.14.0/24
 House 6 - 10.80.15.0/24
 House 7 - 10.80.16.0/24

 The idea is to have all these houses in different vlans with the above subnets. Thank you tons guys!!!!

 We are testing options to have users logging with some sort of MFA into their machines. 
 Great, get Windows hello for business going, applied to some test machines : fantastic! Face id + pin! yea!
 Then we figure out we can simply login with user/pass, and there is not way to enable mfa. Why? what's the point of even implementing Windows hello for business if you can't enforce mfa on user/passwords?
 Then ok, phew... we can hide the login with username/password button but...you can't use runas / rdp etc..
 so what is the effing point? Can someone explain me the logic of this?

 Seeking advice on handling a growing concern in our organisation regarding cyber security for our board members. They frequently access sensitive information on their personal devices, and their skill level is very worrying. We've recently identified them as the weakest link in our organisation due to the mix of BYO PCs and Macs.
 Has anyone else faced a similar issue? If so, what steps did you take to mitigate the risk and ensure the security of your data?
 Considerations thus far include making 365 read-only when accessed in a browser. We've ruled out supplying a separate device for our organisation as they sit on multiple boards.
 We are considering Netspoke for our org but only in the early stages of this discussion. Could this assist.
 Any suggestions or best practices would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.

 Explanation: I've worked in smaller environments ever since I started in IT 8 years ago. I've worked on a lot of different things but not necessarily deep into a single thing. If I need to know more about something I can read documentation and/or use Google and solve the issue. The problem is this doesn't seem to be cutting it. Companies want me to know things off the top of my head without doing research. Or some things I am confident I would be able to learn/pick up on fairly quickly. Some of this is my poor interviewing skills which I am working on. For example I interviewed for a Tech specialist 3/Jr Sys Admin roll and the feedback I got at the end of the interview was that they thought I had the skills of a level 1 tech. 
 So I guess my question is what have you guys done to build your "jack of all trades" job history into something that works at a larger company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Still new to the role, so I'm uncertain about the best practices for this. Apparently, this Small school has to have an internal DNS server to direct them to our website using the internal IP's. This is for all the students and everyone in every subnet. And I asked why they just don't use the public IP if it's accessible. Well, the answer was simple. You cannot access any of the internal websites from the inside using the public IP address. I thought that was strange. 
 I did a basic traceroute to the website and yep, it stops on our Palo Alto firewall. It's due to an Age out/incomplete which I'm sure is due to the Virtual router in the firewall not knowing where to send the traffic. 
 However, I'm not sure how this should be done. 
 Do I just implement a routing rule that anyone coming to the firewall internally asks for the public IP address of our website to redirect them back through the same interface? 
 Baically the Default Gateway from the Core Switch has 1 interface connected to the Palo as the next hop that connects that interface to the router, then that router has a next hop for all traffic to our actual router. 
 So 
 Core Switch 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 Palo Alto Vr Router -PublicIP interface. 1 -> Public IP interface Physical Router -> The internet. 
 To be clear yes the Firewall has an interface with a public IP address that we own that hops to the router with also a Public IP address that we own and then to the internet.

 We are slowing trying to move everything off of ESXi and on to Hyper-V
 Going to use the MS storage migration service. About 2.5TB 
 Right now the drive holding all of the data is on a virtual disk added to the VM via ESXi.
 My question.
 Is it best to just add a virtual disk on the new server in Hyper-V and copying all the data there?
 Or is there any benefit of connecting the new storage volume via iSCSI to the new server and then copying all the data there? 
 Only benefit I can think of is that if the file server had an issue we can In theory connect the drive to another server via iSCSI.
 However I know I can just mount the virtual disk to another server via Hyper-V
 Little background on the environment, have a Hyper-V cluster going with a clusters storage via a Nimble SAN.
 I am also planning a doing a replication of the server to a offsite location using Veeam.
 Thank you all in advance for your input please comment if I am maybe not going at this the right way or if there is a better way too got to accomplish this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y’all, I’m currently taking a wireless networking class and we just wrapped up our first unit covering 802.11 Wifi, we’re supposed to write a paper discussing the differences between an 802.11s network and an ESS network but I’m having trouble finding papers or sources that detail this. From what I’m finding the 802.11s protocol is simply the protocol for an ESS mesh network so I feel like I’m going in circles trying to compare something to itself. If y’all could help me figure out what I’m missing or point me in the direction of some papers to read I’d really appreciate it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Short question: 
 How would hosts from Subnet A handle an ARP announcement regarding a host from Subnet B?
 Longer question: 
 We are trying to setup a VPN server on our servers subnet, 10.1.4.0. We randomly decided an IP range that the server would hand out to clients, 10.1.16.0. When a client connects to the server, the server sends out an ARP announcement saying that it's MAC address has said client with a 10.1.16.x address. But when I look at the server's gateway (a Firepower) and other hosts on the subnet, the ARP tables aren't storing/saving hosts with 10.1.6.x IPs. Is that expected behavior? I know that ARP packets don't usually cross subnet boundaries, but this seems like a unique situation so I figured I'd ask you smart folks. Thanks in advance!

 But as I am also involved in the network design in our company I am curious to know what real world experiences look like. Googleing often gives you just a comparison table and a summary but never very specific and often just scratching the surface. So what experiences and opinions do you have about it and where do you see strengths and weaknesses in your network? Has it actively helped against malware or was it a weakness (for example due to weak root cert protection).
 Thank you for your answer in advance and have a lovely day. So let me end with the word: Fight! 😉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I posted asking about getting xconnect over MPLS running between two routers, and was shown how to do a QinQ tunnel and that was great. Now I'm trying to get VPLS to run multipoint between three routers.
 The issue I'm running into is everything I'm reading has me creating a VFI in manual configuration mode. But I don't have that option...when I go to issue the command the only choice is point-to-point. If I try to re-issue the command the help menu will then SAY that manual is an option, but if I try it I get told the name is already in use.
 The other issue has to do with the xconnect command on the interface. The docs I'm reading have you issue the xconnect name with the VFI, and that's also not an option: The only option is the IP of the neigbor. Maybe if I configure the VFI manually and actually get the "vpn id" option into the VFI it'll allow me to attach it with xconnect? But I can't figure out what I'm missing.
 This is on 3800 routers. I've tried different code and always get the same options. Am I missing something that turns these features on?

 When last I posted here on the topic, prior to the Christmas break, I was being pressured into shunting all of my IT stuff into a broom closet. My direct supervisor is the 2nd in command for the whole school system, and he became more and more furious over this request as I brought it up to him over our break. He clearly is on my side in this, which means case closed, it's not happening. 
 I've chatted up the admin at the high school since on numerous occasions, and it has never once come up in conversation. Having 6 carts full of laptops charging in the room every day has helped, as there would be no space at all for this stuff. Between that, a laminator, a sound system for our gym, and countless spare machines, it would be impossible to fit all that stuff into their proposed "space", never mind trying to cram a pair of bodies in there with our desks to boot. 
 All in all, I wanted to update everyone to let you all know that it worked, and that I am still master of my domain (puns for days). I know my employees appreciate my hard line I took in this matter, but I also wanted to thank all of you for supporting my choices in this matter. It's one of my highest rated posts on here, and I got a lot of great feedback from members of this sub. IT people deserve better than the crap we get from most people, and all the IT folks I talk to, even in conversations today, agree with me. We are not often treated with respect and dignity, but I'm not going to let that happen on my watch, with my staff, for as long as I am employed here. 
 So thanks again, and feel free to comment or message me any questions you might have about working on a First Nations reserve, or in a FN school. I know my living and working situation is unique, so don't be shy.

 This question is regarding stacking/ uplinks. 
 We're planning a new location setup. This will be my first time doing a configuration like this solo as our engineer is no longer with us, I appreciate any help/advice 
 We run a two-tier hierarchy design. We'll have 1 Core switch along with a 5 stack for access switches. This will be for a small(ish) branch location, so not looking to go all out. 
 What would be the best way to uplink the access stack to the Core? 
 Looking though what our old engineer did, he would use the first two ports on the stack commander to use as uplinks to the Core.
 Would that be the best option, or do we have a point of failure if that stack commander goes down? 
 I'm thinking of using 1 port ( or two?) from each switch in the stack to use as an uplink to the Core. Is this silly/over kill? Planning on configuring them all into 1 LAG. ( ex. 1/1/1, 2/1/1, 3/1/1, etc. into LAG ID 1).
 Also, they're looking at getting a 24 port core opposed to a 48. Technically, if I use 1 port on each switch for uplinks I should only need ~16 ports, ~20 if if I go with two per switch. 
 Is there something I'm not thinking of that could cause issues down the line? Our current Core's are all 48 ports, though the old admin would use the extra ports as Access, which I do not plan on doing.

 Or should we host our own authoritative and recursive DNS servers?
 Or should we use a recursive DNS server provided by someone like Cloudflare?

 Easy enough let's take a look.
 The alert has been going on since 2008 and they've simply ignored it. 
 I was in middle school when this poor lady started having a problem, and she's just now submitting a ticket.
 The log entries number in the thousands
 Happy Monday everyone.
 Edit: Adding context here since this is blowing up.
 The user is logging into an application that we host on a remote server, the database which is being used has data from as far back as 1999. The application itself still gets updates to this day. Even when deleted the alert still remains
 Edit 2: We normally would clear this thing out with a script. Problem is ours doesn't work for something this large so we've had to contact the vendor.

 I'm looking for a kind of "authentication" solution (?)..
 We have a network with about 100 users who are either on a company domain joined device, or on their personal device, but they have a domain account.
 We would like to have people using domain joined devices to connect to our wireless lan and just have their internet working, and if the device is not domain joined/whitelisted there is a login page that allows them to authenticate - and grant access to web based on the user group for example.
 I'm not even sure what type of solution am I looking for? Is it considered a NAC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i've been battling Microsoft Teams for the past months, most of the time the Addin have not been added automatically, but for the last week i've been battling a plugin which is showing as Active, however none of the functions actually shows up or works (Share on Teams is the only button that shows up but does nothing) 
 So today i sat down to investigate, and i figured out that the culprit is the MicrosoftTeamsAddin version, however no search results shows any of these issues..
 But i've replicated the issue on 3 WVD Enviroments.
 MicrosoftTeamsAddin Versions 
  
1.0.22321.3 - borked
 
1.0.22304.2 - borked
 
1.0.22272.2 - borked
 
1.0.22234.1 - borked
 
1.0.22209.4 - borked
 
1.0.22147.1 - ok
 
1.0.20091.2 - ok
 
1.0.19296.2 - ok
 
 Teams Versions 
  
1.6.0.376 - borked - 2 February 2023
 
1.5.0.33362 - borked - 14 December 2022
 
1.5.0.31168 - borked - 2 November 2022
 
1.5.0.28361 - borked - 20 October 2022
 
1.5.0.21668 - borked (1.0.22209.4) - 31 August 2022
 
1.5.0.21463 - ok (1.0.22147.1) - 11 August 2022
 
1.5.0.17656 - ok (1.0.22147.1) - 06 July 2022
 
 Teams is installed with ALLUSER=1 and IsWVDEnviroment set to 1 in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Teams 
 I can also confirm the issue is not present when installed as Current user, atleast not on a normal client. 
 So my question is, have any of you encountered this issue AND resolved it? And can you replicate it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are looking at ways to try to reduce the attack surface of on our LAN. To that end, we currently have communication between client workstations blocked so they can only communicate with servers.
 We've tried to go further by even reducing that to only necessary services. For example, we've blocked client workstations from communication with servers via SMB ports 139 and 445 (obviously with a few exceptions such as our file server and Domain Controller).
 Now, running our last port scan, I see we still have port 135 open from workstations to servers. Can I safely block that?
 My understanding is it is used for RPC and remote management. Ideally what I am trying to set up is to block all remote management like RDP, WinRM, etc to my servers from ordinary client workstations and only allow it from a bastion host.
 I know you should not block it between servers like DCs because that will break replication. But what about blocking it from client workstations? Is that safe to do?
 Thanks!

 The results: https://imgur.com/a/LlazOTr
 I don't have much experience with storage, but 100MB/s seq write seems kind of slow, especially for SSD? I understand that we bought entry level storage, but shouldn't it able to outperform our 6 year old storage with HDD disks?
 The new storage is configured with raid 6, compression and deduplication, connected with FC. When testing storage speed without compression and deduplication the results are little bit better, but it doesn't max out CPU in any case.

 Ultimately, it's exactly the opposite of what you'd normally want: to not be on the spammers' radar. I want to be right on the spammers' radar and on their mailing lists.
 Do you have any suggestions, further ideas on what to try to get spammers to acquire my email addresses and send spam there as well.

 I need your advice. 
 I want to externalise some networking tasks to a Help Desk. I want them to perform basic troubleshooting before forwarding a network-related ticket to my support group. 
 Our network is fully cloud-based. So, there won't be a CLI involved. I was thinking to create one generic account, linked with the Help Desk support group email, with ReadOnly rights to be used by all ~60 members of the Help Desk. 
 Some of my colleagues suggested that there is a security & privacy issue with this approach and that I should create personal accounts for all Help Desk operators linked to their work emails. 
 Do you see any security issues with this or not? 
 Thank you in advance!

 We are pretty overwhelmed at the moment and I wanted to see what others though as we seem to be a bit of a different demographic composition. We do self-checkout devices. There is about 1000 locations total and the majority of these are sitting on your standard household type internet circuits. Inexpensive Fiber (FiOS, uVserve, cable internet, cellular routers, and even some DSL (Yes, DSL!). We do have maybe 300 locations that are either on business fiber, or the location we are at provide us internet.
 User base though is only about 500 and a lot of the "is your cable plugged in", "did you reboot your 8-port switch under your desk" is handled by our "Desktop Support team".
 We are also installing 3-7 new locations a week and the network team has to handle getting the internet solution in place as well.
 Our network team is a whopping 3x people. I feel like we need at least 6x. anyone in a similar setup. ?These three people are also responsible for the datacenter networking, our HQ facility, but not VoIP (other than setting up VLANs for phones)

 Asides from reaching out to third parties to accommodate the change, is anyone aware of any other measures we can take to reduce misdelivery?

The data that has possibly been taken includes contact details, dates of birth, vehicle details, ID documents (such as passports and driver’s licences), National Insurance numbers (in limited cases) and bank account details.
 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64488013 
 Fuck Me. 
 I have done the usual, cancelling cards and passports, keeping an eye on my accounts but I thought I would send a Subject access request to Arnold Clark, to maybe see what data they could have lost, knowing full well that they would struggle to fulfil it BUT hoping against all hope I would get something. 
 I received a quick boilerplate response, explaining their situation and how they can't help right now BUT "we'd ask that you provide a copy of your I.D. (either Driving License or Passport) to enable us to verify your details"
 Fuck No.

 Require a system that will serve a responsive dynamic intranet homepage, with links and menu items for different audiences within the organisation.
 The ability to create and easily manage templates of different link sets for AD user groups (and combinations of groups if possible). We have Azure AD.
 Allows panels to be embedded, serving other pages from our domain eg. KPI info, outstanding tasks etc.
 Bonus points if it already has MS integrations eg. Email, calendar, but not essential.
 Maybe I'm searching the wrong terminology but I'm not finding a turnkey solution for what I've got in mind which I find surprising.
 We have SharePoint but not a fan of the general look & feel so something that builds on this may suffice, but managing SharePoint list items for the different audiences isn't my preferred route for this.
 Welcome your experiences and recommendations.

 First, it’s my understanding that Active Directory provides directory and account permissions management. Is this correct?
 Secondly, as I understand it, both do the same thing except that Azure AD is hosted the cloud while on-prem AD is hosted on a local server. Is this correct?
 Can someone explain the main differences between these?

 Also, are communication protocols embedded into the hardware architecture or can we just define our own protocols and test them out? 
 Thanks. Any help or slap towards the right directions is appreciated.

I'll call these AD.foo.bar and BD.foo.bar When users are created they are created in the AD domain. For reasons we want to mange our environment with a different domain. We created the domain BD and a two way trust between them. In the BD domain I can create groups, add users from AD to these groups, authenticate computer logins, most of the things I would expect to be able to do. However we have a couple web applications that can do authentication from Active Directory which want a base DN for users and groups. This is where I run into the problem. The base DN for users something like OU=company,DC=AD,DC=foo,DC=bar While the DN for users is OU=company,DC=BD,DC=foo,DC=bar
 My question, is there a good way around this kind of problem? Is it worth trying to copy users between domains or is there something here that I might totally be missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Sysadmins!
 I ran into a problem which may cause some serious privacy issues, and i havent found any solutions on the internet.
 The problem is as follows, we have a user, he opens the office365 outlook app and checks the inbox of a shared mailbox.
 After checking, he presses on a new email as he decides to mail a client of ours, types the email etc and as last step he goes to the options field and checks the from adres, it shows his personal work email. He sends the mail to our client.
 However, now the mail he has send is showing up in the shared mailbox sent items. Every user can now read the mail in send items. It shows the personal from adres from our user. For me this is 100% reproducible, as i take the same steps. I would expect the reciever to get the mail as send on behalf of the shared mailbox, but to the reciever it shows as a mail recieved by the personal mailbox. The header of the mail also has no sign what so ever from the shared mailbox. 
 Now this is kinda a red flag, as this would mean that user in our organisation might think he is typing a private message to someone else, only to show up in the sent items of the shared mailbox..
 What am I missing? Sorry in advance if it's a bit jibbrish or bad gramma , I will edit the post to clarify or edit Grammer if needs be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We plan to upgrade our File Server Failover Cluster from Server 2016 to Server 2019. It consists of 2 Nodes, Functional Level is 2016. 
 I read these 2 articles:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/upgrade-option-same-hardware
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/cluster-operating-system-rolling-upgrade
 From my understanding, it's possible to upgrade without any downtime?
 Like this?: Pause cluster, drain, evict, reformat, and install Server 2019 on one node. Add this node to the cluster and run it in Mixed-OS mode. Then do the same on the other node and lastly run "Update-ClusterFunctionalLevel". 
 But is that really the most efficient way to do it?
 In the first linked article "Upgrading Failover Clusters on the same hardware" in the overview part it is written:
  
Upgrading the operating system on an existing failover cluster is only supported when going from Windows Server 2016 to Windows 2019. If the failover cluster is running an earlier version, such as Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier, upgrading while the cluster services are running will not allow joining nodes together. 
  
So what does this mean? It's not explained further...
 Lastly, in-place upgrade or new installation?
 Any input is welcome (:

 ssh_connection -> access to let's say everything

 we are starting with a central log management server and like to extend this later on to a siem solution.
 ATM we are enable more logs on Active Directory. Now the Security Log Protocol on our domain controller fills up quite fast. About 500k events per day. The problem is, that the domain controller become unresponsive some times. 
 How do you deal with this problem? Of course i could raise the cpu and ram on the virutal dc, but it seams that the eventlog services is single threaded. 
 We are using the elastic stack and nxlog as log shipper.

Noticed a lot of devices not updating on the WSUS server so ran a report to highlight which ones do not currently have 22H2 on them due to the impending EOL for 21H2 and this lead to me checking what my predecessor had been doing with inactive/disused devices.
 Turns out they are all moved into an OU on AD rather than being deleted/removed.
 Is this normal practice? I'm inclined to just remove anything that hasn't logged in for over 1 year (with exceptions)

 We have about 15 sites, and 10 of those we had already upgraded to Cisco 350x switches. The other 5 or so are still Adtran. We tested for compatibility with the old and new stuff in the lab and felt pretty good. We have a funky assortment of different SFPs but, made sure to test for each different combination. I got new FS. COM SFPs and all the switches seemed ok with them. One thing was for sure, the Cisco 550 hated BlackBox SFPs and would crash hard when we tried them.

 Anyone has experience dealing with error similar to the below?
 ​
 ERROR 2 (0x00000002) Copying NTFS Security to Destination File \\filesvr\file.txt
 The system cannot find the file specified.
 Below is the robocopy command that I use.
 ROBOCOPY \\bgr-fp01\f$\data\ G:\data\ /MIR /Sec /SECFIX /XA:SH /XJD /copy:DATSOU /MT:64 /R:1 /W:5 /LOG:%LOG%
 ​
 When taking a look at the above example file, I do not have permission to view the folder/files nor I can see what NTFS/Shared permissions that are set.
 If I take ownership of the folder/subfolder/files, and provide myself full permission to the folder/files, then I won't get the above ERROR 2...
 ​
 There are a lot of the above errors shown in the robocopy log as there are quite a large amount of data to be copied to new file server. Does it mean that I have to take ownership of the top folder including any sub folder/file and gave myself permission to all these files in order to avoid the above error? 
 ​
 Is there another way to do this? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

 Quick and easy from a random conversation today with a client/IT Tech who asked why this is not possible; 
 Client/IT - Purchased a lot of Windows 10 HOME devices (dont ask why)
 Client/IT has staff using E3 and E5 licenses
 Client/IT wants to purchase a single Windows 10 Pro license and use it to upgrade all HOME devices to PRO and then join the device to Azure to make it change from Pro to Enterprise using the single key from before.
 Is this remotely possible and even allowed or they talking hyperbole BS to me ? 
 Note, we do some of their MSP but they have their own inhouse IT who do more comms, radios, rock breaking and digging stuff and its their environment, we just help them out from time to time.

The batteries all went out of date during the pandemic and office shutdown while in conditioned storage. I'm looking to buy a pile of batteries to deal with the new office setup. I haven't bought these in 5 or 6 years. So I'll ask.
 The Duracell battery that I need is:
 SLA12-8F Duracell Ultra 12V 8AH AGM SLA Battery with F1 Terminals
 I bought 4 of these "down the street" just to test out the units. All work fine. But at $45 or so each, ouch.
 So, what brand of battery do the networking folks like to buy when they age out of the UPS systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening,
 A few months ago, I replaced a bunch of Catalyst 2960S switches in our environment with new Cisco 9200L series switches. The swapover went well in general, but recently our users have started complaining about intermittent VOIP quality issues. I'm assuming a simple QoS policy will resolve the issue, but I'm having some issues understanding how I should go about it.
 We have two switch stacks. Three switches in a stack in one building with our ISP routers, two switches in a stack in our other building. A 10G fiber uplink connects the switch stacks between buildings.
 We have a VOIP Vlan set to Vlan 100. Most user access ports have both the VOIP Vlan and general data VLAN (200) configured. Ex:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3 switchport access vlan 200 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 100 spanning-tree portfast 
 Our phones are older Polycom devices, not Cisco.
 I've read up on Cisco Auto QoS, but I've also read it's not the most efficient way of implementing QoS. Especially in an environment that isn't using Cisco phones. I started a support case with Cisco, but they just sent me the Auto QoS documentation I already have...
 Can anyone help me understand what should be done here? Is there a way I can just tell the switch "prioritize anything on Vlan 100"? What about the uplink between switches? 
 Thanks!

 For context, I’m a networking grad in Canada that was hired at a big bank on the network provisioning/management team (which I think is a tier/level above the NOC), and so I’m wondering if I’m missing out on valuable networking experience not starting in a NOC.
 I do have my CCNA and I can confidently say I know the fundamentals, but will it be a big hindrance that I didn’t start out in a NOC. Or will working on my current team expose me eventually to the common and fundamentals of enterprise networking through implementing changes/sitting in on meeting, etc.
 Would also love to hear from those who have not worked in a NOC and how your career has gone.

 From what I was reading is it any device that supports 802.11 and up supported but I could very well be wrong. They are needing a new TV and would like to connect it for smart features.

 I hope someone can help me out. I'm searching for a comprehensive guide on setting up Azure Cloud Sync when both the Azure tenant and AD are already in place. Our team is currently facing some difficulties with duplicated users and manual mapping, and any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

 We came across https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-existing-tenant but we are looking for a bit more of a guided walkthrough, maybe a video or something with the steps included.

 Our current CISO area is consistently shooting other IT software requests in the foot. We have a current workflow where they are approving/disapproving software for use within our company, however recently they have denied things that would be free or alternatives to SnagIt (think ShareX or Greenshot), KeePass (they suggested LastPass Enterprise), as well as denied VLC with no available suitable replacement.
 Our IT teams are 100% impacted by these disapprovals and the CISO team are not keeping our asset mgmt team in mind, nor our users in mind. I'm currently not in a full sysadmin role but we do wear a certain hat in it.
 We've communicated that we want to get these and other software approved as enterprise solutions where the end-user can have 1-2 options for the most common requests we get. Unfortunately, they have legal and the privacy team involved which just seem to align with whatever our CISO says. I've never seen any of the 3 teams contradict. Keep in mind that they are all approved by our Chief Technology Office for security review.

 Hi r/sysadmin,
 Just wanted to report on an issue i had this morning in case anyone else runs into it.
 Sit:
 Brand new Dell T440 running Windows 2022. All OS and firmware updates applied (thank you iDRAC!)
 System is stand-alone on a LAN2 network leg. No other devices are on the same subnet other than the internal leg of the firewall.
 Installed domain services
 Promoted system to be a DC, reboot, etc.
 Issue:
 Ethernet was showing as public or private but not as Domain. (Single port , 2nd is currently disabled)
 Normal fix of restarting Network Location Awareness and Network list service failed (NL hang)..
 Multiple reboots did not work although i could always log onto the console using the domain credentials.
 ​
 Fixes tried:
 Turned on preference for ipv4 over ipv6
 Downgraded the network drivers, Upgraded the network drivers, played with Ethernet metrics (temp fix only)
 EDIT:
 Set NLA to Delayed start (did NOT help)
 Fix that worked:
 Set a dependency for DNS for the NLA service in the registry.
 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc
 DependOnService -add DNS to the list
 Reboot. Problem solved.
 However the system still says Metered (even though it does not appear to be turned on, can download, full speed tests, etc.). I found references to this problem but no solutions so far if anyone has any ideas.
 Hope this saves someone else some precious time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are undergoing a re-write of many of our corporate policies and I would like to propose a system for managing these. To date, they are strewn about many different emails, SharePoint sites and Teams. Obviously this isn't sustainable.
 I'm not adverse to buying new software for this, however I generally am not a fan of niche software that isn't integrated with the rest of our systems.
 An ideal system would allow for certain people to update policies, but most (or all) employees being able to see the policies. It must either integrate with M365 or just be a solution native to the platform. Ideally folks would be able to track changes to the policy with different versions to see what's changed, and maybe get an alert when there is a new or updated policy.
 I figure I could do most of this with SharePoint but feels like I'd be building a lot of it from scratch. Any thoughts on what works well for you? I assume there are a lot of people frustrated by this and a lot of people thinking to themselves, "If I could build this all over again I'd do it this way...." so come at me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, here is a layout of this site:
 ​
 3 poweredge 730's, ESXi 6.5
 A NAS Datastore using iSCSI
 1 isolated network switch for communications between the hosts/datastores
 ​
 Yesterday, one of our remote sites had the strangest issues, I am still trying to make sense of it.
 Around 10am, I got a message that one of the hosts had a ConnectionStateAlarm. I remoted in and checked vsphere and sure enough, one of the three hosts at that site had a connection state issue. I acknowledged the alarm and checked the VPN circuit. It was pegged out (some type of NAS backup was running, this is not unusual). I cancelled the backup and the circuit went back to a normal state.
 I was thinking that host 1 would come back but it never did. I tried signing into ESXi through the web interface for the host, but the connection would time out on the page after putting in my credentials and hitting login. Tried SSH and I would get a connection refused. Logged in through iDRAC, rebooted the host. It came up without issue.
 So then, this happens on another host, we will call it host 2. Same deal, same site. I also cannot log into ESXi. I ended up getting into the iDRAC and rebooting the host. When it came up, it resynced and all was well. 
 FAST FORWARD AN HOUR LATER.
 I get an alarm that the third host is down and that an HA Event had failed. I logged in, one of my datastores is inaccessible and the third host is now down. This one, I cannot even get into the iDRAC, web interface or SSH.
 I got someone that was near the site to go and reboot the host manually from the rack, it came back up without issue. As for the datastore, I went into the connection & multipathing screen and had to manually mount it back to the first 2 hosts that we rebooted.
 All is back up and no alarms. I had generated support bundles to have VMWare check on this monday. Wow what a Saturday.

Tasks communicate with each other by passing messages over the nodes' gates. I want to simulate a fault-tolerant mechanism where a node can fail and the system reconfigures itself by migrating tasks on the faulty node to other healthy nodes. I already developed an algorithm for migrating tasks but I want to test it with OMNeT++. 
 ​
 In the NED file, I have defined the network with the different nodes as submodules and tasks as submodules of the nodes (sub-submodules). But I can't connect the tasks with each other. 
 How can I simulate this behavior? Is there a better simulation tool than OMNeT++ for this use case?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this question we will explore the dynamics of two flows using the AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) and later AIAD (additive increase, additive
 decrease) algorithm instead of AIMD. Consider the topology shown in which two hosts A and B are sending packets to D through router R. 
 The bottleneck link in the path from R to D runs at 10 MB/s (i.e. 10 Megabytes per second). The RTTs from A to D and B to D are 100 ms. Assume that both A and B can
 communicate with R instantaneously and with arbitrarily large rate. Assume that each packet has a length of 1250 bytes and the buffer on router R can hold 200
 packets.
 Suppose that at time t = 0, host A has a congestion window of 999 packets, B has a congestion window of 0, and R’s buffer is empty. You should assume that packet
 drops are always experienced by the flow with more packets in flight. You should assume that each flow updates its congestion window after each RTT, decreasing it if
 any packet was dropped, and increasing it otherwise.
 AIMD: We first consider the evolution of the system when each flow is governed by AIMD, in which the congestion window grows by being incremented and shrinks by
 being halved (rounding down). In roundtrips 0 through 3, the system evolves as shown in the table below with host A exceeding the given congestion window size and
 accordingly reducing CWND to half in the next iteration. 
 Now, suppose that instead we are using an AIAD protocol. In this case, every drop decreases the congestion window by 5 packets (to a minimum of 1 packet) instead
 of halving the congestion window. What is the congestion windows size of host A at t = 300 RTTs? Give your answer in packets. 
 The solution states, it should be 300 but I do not understand why and there is nothing else provided.

 It also stops regularly between labels to think about what to do next.
 Should this device use port RAW or LPR to get optimal efficient printing speed?
 I also see some weird TCP handshake issues in the firewall logs. Not sure is it related to this issue...

 What book would be good / easy to understand on such TCP stack internals - mainly what current Linux/Windows deployments might be doing, so not ancient history but also not bleeding edge research?
 TCP/IP Illustrated, Comer's Internetworking with TCP/IP, Tanenbaum's Computer Networks, or something else?

 I am trying to use Microsoft Office (mainly Word, Excel, Outlook) on my personal computer, not for production purposes. I do not want to pay hundreds of dollars for a license. 
 I've purchased a Microsoft Office Home & Business for Mac 2021: Lifetime License from FatKidDeals (an Amazon affiliate) for my Macbook for $29.99. I assume this is a reputable site and the license is legal. However, they do not have the deal available for Windows.
 I've seen lifetime license deals on sites like CDKeys and ProductKeys. Are these legal? Are they worth the risk?
 Is there any other way to obtain an affordable lifetime license for Windows? I'm open to family packs for 1-5 devices as well since I have multiple devices in my home.

 And so I tried sending a message to my other phone (which uses a SIM card from the same network provider as the other, so I assumed they are on the same network) using the local IP assigned to it. I was expecting to receive the message on the device but didn't, that's why I suspect the reason might be because they use different cellular technology (one 3G and the other 4G).
 Please tell me if my suspicion is true or not. And guide me if I have done anything wrong.

 I've been working in IT for about 15 total years in some capacity. (Freelance and Professional or Contract) Education: Associates in Computer Science /COMPTIA A+ / Network+ / Security+
 I've been working in Data Center roles and lower level engineer roles for some extremely large companies over the last 6 years now and my salary has increased by about $19/hr from 2018 until now. 
 I started out at $11/hr in 2016 Most recent role - $33/hr by end of 2022
 About to start a new job in a week or two, but I got blindsided by another offer from a different company while I'm waiting for my equipment in the mail, sliding me about $15,000 more a year.
 I've been making between $55,000 - $72,000 per year through my last 3/4 positions I've held and have gained a lot more experience during these last few years as well. 
 I'm currently about to start a new job, I am being offered $70,000/yr and about to begin onboarding/training for this role before Feb 15th. However I was just offered another role through a different company, fully remote sysadmin for about $85,000/yr. 
 My questions are mainly... based on anyone else's experience in sysadmin work in the Midwest, should I try to aim for closer to $90k based on my experience? 
 Should I just shut up and take the money?? Or should I aim higher for somewhere between $90k-$100k?
 (This is my first time specifically doing work with a "sysadmin" title, but been performing the same work through other roles I've held in recent years)
 I've looked up some Glassdoor avg salaries for the title but it was a pretty wide range, something like 55k-120k/yr?
 If anyone can help me out with this I'd really appreciate it as I'm trying to pursue making a big change in my life and move towards settling down and building a family with my fiancee. Whatever role will end up offering more in terms of salary and job happiness will be more important to me.

 Clients are a mix of domain servers, non-domain servers, azure AD clients and local-account only clients with either no password or simple shared username/password combinations.

 I left a big corp network job to go to a smaller company for a "promotion" to network engineer with a few K more money. Now the company I left is asking me to come back. They are offering me more than I have now and a true engineer position. I have only been with the new company for 2 months and have never been a job hopping person. I loved where I left, but with some political work there may be some potential for the new company. Tho it was going from CLI to Meraki Dashboard. I am stuck as to what I should do to progress my career. I have an engineer I am working with now who has been here for 10+ years with no progression. 
 I guess my question is should I leave for even more experience in cli with my last company or should I just stay for now and try to change this companies' climate and maybe learn more meraki?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am about to get fiberoptic installed at a rural location. Mobile signal is unreliable at best and sometimes we lose electricity for days and with an elderly parent living there, access to emergency service is a primary concern. Especially as we will have to give up our copper line. 
 My understanding is that as long as we keep power supplied to the ONT, phones and networking in the house will work. My first instinct was to buy the beefiest UPS we can afford, but I have had a UPS die in a puff of smoke. It would be a cruel twist of fate if the backup battery that we installed to maintain emergency communications started a fire and harmed my mother.
 I notice that there are UPSs that are marketed specifically for telecom equipment, such as those listed here:
 https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/products/telecom/indoor/ 
 I notice that these are rather expensive given their output compared to UPSs sold for computers. Is there something special about them? 
 - For example are they optimized for providing lower power over more time? This would make sense for network equipment, whereas computer UPSs are made to keep a desktop computer going at full power for just enought time to shut down. Or would a bigger UPS designed for a computer simply last longer when powering low-power devices?
 ​
 - Might there be safety/fire precautions on these that aren't on regular UPSs? 
 - Any other reasons I might pay extra per watt of power output for one of thse "telecom" UPSs?

We get error 1747, the authentication service is unknown. Nothing we have tried has resolved the issue except not installing ActivClient. The most interesting thing is that machines that were loaded with 21H2 that already have ActivClient installed are them work fine if we do an in-place upgrade on them to 22H2. The issue only occurs on cleanly loaded machines. Has anyone ever seen anything like this, and is anyone running ActivClient on Windows 11 22H2?

 Anyways, I tried the classic pressing "mode" button during power-on. Despite me giving all my might and pressing/holding for upwards of a minute, the switch does not seem to enter the "switch:" prompt. It always boots normally. I tried different permutation of 5 seconds, 15, seconds, pressing mode when I unplug power, then continuing to hold when I plug power back in, etc.
 I explored other alternatives by breaking the boot. But that doesn't seem to work either - when I'm consoled in, using firstly PuTTY, then Teraterm and sending break commands didn't work either.
 When it boots, I do see a message: The password-recovery mechanism is enabled.
 But it continues to boot normally into a configuration of a password I cannot remember.
 Any guidance would be appreciated.

 It replied.
 Here's a step-by-step guide on how to migrate user profiles from a Windows Server 2012R2 to Windows Server 2019:
 Backup the old profiles: On the Windows Server 2012R2, open the File Explorer and navigate to the folder where user profiles are stored. This folder is typically located in C:\Users. Right-click on the folder and select "Export" to backup each user profile.
 Copy the profiles to the new server: On the Windows Server 2019, open File Explorer and navigate to the folder where user pr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to set up a lab environment for my project, which supports a decade-old legacy system. The objective is to create corresponding setup guides and compile the necessary lab setup resources together for the team's future use. Our repository hasn't been updated since the system's deployment. Right now, I'm working on the setup of a particular server in the lab, which was only introduced during the system's mid-life upgrade. As such, there were no setup documentation for it and I had to reverse engineer the existing server to make guides for it from scratch.
 One of the software deployed in the system is SharePoint Portal Server 2003. It took me a while to realise that the version deployed in production is updated to Service Pack 3, but I only have the base version's installer. I searched high and low and haven't been able to find the SP3 installer anywhere in my office's repositories. The official download link from Microsoft is dead too.
 Does anyone know where I can get this file (likely named SPS2003SP3-kb923644-fullfile-ENU.exe - KB923644), or where I can go to ask? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm still new to networking and haven't experienced too much with Public DNS records. 
 but for information, the design is that there are 2 DNS servers setting between the Router and the Firewall. The Router is in front so the structure is ISP - Router - DNS - Firewall - Internal Network. 
 This external DNS keeps the Host and only Host A files that lets the internet know that website A is IP whatever for the college. 
 I believe the DNS servers forward the traffic to Quad9 or something like that, not sure why, but if some one can assist to the reason, I'm sure its a verification method or something to proof that we are the actual college we are advertising or to tell other larger DNS providers know who we are if some one form another state tries to reach our website. 
 So on to my question. Is there a better way? I would like to move our records off site to something like cloud flair. However I set up a meeting with them and they said the minimum they covered was for websites that hit 1 million hits per month. Obviously its a community college in a rural area so we get around 17,000 hits. Then they wanted $20,000 a year. 
 Now I was trying to keep my cool, but choking inside, so I didn't get a chance to clarify, but I think they thought I wanted some of the premium features and such when really I just wanted to host A records so we had a cloud DNS and if that's just a free thing or if we have to pay a fee. I think it was confusion because the prices on the website did not match up to what they were telling me. 
 Can any one clarify if Cloud Flair is free to host records and all I have to do is just verify that we are who we say we are? 
 or really any better solution to external DNS hosting or is it fine the way we have it set up?

I’m a Network Administrator in the Marine Corps with 7ish years of experience and debating on leaving once my contract is up in a couple of years because I don’t want to move around anymore. I’m just worried I’m not going to enjoy what I do once I get out because currently I get to work on a lot of equipment and it’s honestly a lot of fun. I’m also curious if anyone has a role/job somewhat similar to what I do? For instance, at a typical training exercise I get to setup an equipment string supporting about 50-200 users which includes a Satellite Transmissions System or fiber connection and connect it to my router which connects via DMVPN to a NOC and pull services from there. I also get to setup/configure all switches to other offices (tents) to end devices and some encryption equipment and VoIP thrown in there as well. Usually it’s me and 1-2 other people doing all of this and we get a lot of time configuring which I enjoy. So I guess I’m just curious if anyone gets exposed to a lot of different equipment or do you mainly stick to a specific area of configuration? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Experts,
 We are looking to setup something unique and get two firewalls setup behind our Comcast EDI. The challenge we are having is we need to route are usable block of /27 to different WAN /29 address on two firewalls.
 Comcast has given us
 P2P IP:xxx.xxx.xxx.232/29 Gateway (.233) Comcast router Customer Layer 3 (.234)Customer Useable IP’s: xxx.xxx.xxx.235 – xxx.xxx.xxx.238
 and we have Usable EDI Static Range: yyy.yyy.yyy.225-.254 and this is 255.255.255.224 or /27
 I think that Comcast sends our Usable range to the xxx.xxx.xxx.234 address. 
 What I have tried is to assign the .234 to a VLAN on our Dell N4000 switch with routing enabled. Then I assigned .235 and .236 to WAN interface on each firewall.
 Our issue comes when trying to setup a route in the table to send yyy.yyy.yyy.226 to the .235 ip. We are going to have to send different usable to the different firewalls. The switch complains that the rout is invalid, which makes sense since its a different network.
 Lots of people suggest getting an EdgeRouter X, would that let me do this?
 Any suggestions on getting our switch to do this type of routing?
 ​
 Thanks!

 Edit: Here is a picture of the PSU: https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/static/media/9198938f-8c47-5a0e-82d9-6db6a62cd3f7/DAM-ccd92840-c3fa-4d5c-9c55-cf231e6069f4/out/2711.024.jpg
 Max input power: 100 to 240 VAC +/- 10%, single phase
 AC line current: 10.6A @ 100 VAC, 5.3 A @ 200 VAC
 AC Inlet Type: IEC320-C14 (high-line, 200 VAC), IEC320-C20 (low-line, 100 VAC)
 Issue:
 I have a 120V PDU that has NEMA 5-20 receptacles (L5-30 input). The PSU will not power on with a C13/NEMA 5-15 or C13/NEMA 5-20 cord. I want to use this PDU.
 I also have a 200-240V PDU (L6-30 input) with C14 inputs. The PSU works when using a C13/C14 cord in this PDU. I don't want to use this PDU.
 Question:
 Can someone give a quick explanation of these power requirements/specs on the PSU? My interpretation is that the PSU supports 120V thus a NEMA 5-15/NEMA 5-20 cable should be enough to power the PSU.
 Am I misinterpreting the specs or does the PSU have some sort of sensing ability to know that an IEC plug is not being used? FWIW, daisy-chaining C13/C14 into C13/NEMA x also doesn't work.
 Edit:
 I have talked to Dell about this and they suggested getting a C13/NEMA 5-20P cable. I did and it still didn't work.

 Our virtual machines are Azure Virtual Desktop and it seems like they recently just started. All Teams are installed with Teams Universal Installer" or whatever the name is, but even we are having difficulty updating the latest version because the older version and files are stuck on the VM. Like we CANNOT get them off no matter how hard we try.
 We have installed the latest version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. and Remote Desktop WebRTC Redirector Service installer.
 The errors we see on the VM for Teams:
  
Can't select any audio/video devices
 "Couldn't connect to AVD for media optimization, Audio and video quality may be reduced Talk to your IT admin"
  
Does Teams need to be updated? Does Team just suck? Is this a service issue with Microsoft?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have recently been trying to find out a deep dive into what exactly networking ports are. This is regarding TCP and UDP ports.
 Whenever I search what exactly are networking ports, I see explanations about how they are a way to identify a service. 
 I have not seen explanations on how this is achieved.
 When a server receives a request on port 22, the TCP/IP stack inspects the destination port, and sees the number 22 there. Is the TCP/IP stack configured in such a way that each port number must be associated with a certain service, like if the number is 22, then forward the request to the sshd service?
 After the TCP/IP stack inspects the port number, will it forward the request to the relevant service - sshd in this case?
 I have thought of ports as "gates" to remotely access a service. Each service has its own PID, but this PID stays local, so ports are a way to access these services remotely. We won't be able to remotely access the service by its PID. But we can access the service if there is a TCP/IP stack that does the forwarding of request based on the destination port number?
 The questions above are just my own explanation of how ports are bound to services, and how the TCP/IP stack assists in forwarding the request to the relevant service. If anybody has knowledge in this, it would be great for someone to share it.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/sysadmin!
 I can't wrap up my mind around this. Earlier this week at my workplace I had a iSCSI target from a Synology RackStation RS3614xs+ NAS (DSM 6.2.2-24922) suddenly disconnect overnight on a Windows Server. When I started investigating after noticing the issue, DSM tells me in the storage manager that "There is no volume in your system". 12-disk RAID6 is fine, alive and healthy, S.M.A.R.T. of all disks displays a "Normal/Healthy" status so nothing to worry about I think (only 1 disk mentioned 1 bad sector at the time after the sudden target disconnect). Storage pool is also operating normally from what DSM shows.
 I can still access the target, the data is still there but this volume "missing" in DSM is getting me a little worried.
 Every other RackStation NAS (configured with iSCSI/LUNs) we have currently running and everything I see on the web says that on a Synology NAS a LUN is located on a volume (like Volume 1) and not straight on a storage pool.
 I'm no expert in storage topics and still learning but everything I see in my investigation of the issue points in the direction that this is not a normal behavior. I searched on the web for a similar experience and cannot find cases where LUNs point straight to storage pool location instead of like an ext4 volume for example.
 What are your thoughts about this?
 Please let me know if additional context and details (even logs or output of CLI commands) are needed.
 Thanks in advance for your insight, and have a nice day!

 I’ve been tasked with updating our site Content Security Headers. We currently have a couple of old ones on there. Our pen-testers want us to get rid of the one header that is “script-src ‘self’” I figured I would remove that then add in our domain name so that way anything that comes from our site is approved. I have our active CSP headers so when I added our domain it is in a new CSP Report only. But I keep getting the error that the directive name contains one or more invalid characters. I’ve double checked to make sure there wasn’t an exception xtra space or anything and cannot get it to work. This is what I have now:
 Content-securit-policy Script-src ‘self’

 I've got two WAN connections in a failover arrangement:
 WAN1 FTTP
 WAN2 5G failover
 VLANs:
 1 10 20 30 200
 In the UI dashboard its not giving accurate info on how much data is flowing between the different vlans... is this normal?
 so lets say the sky glass is active and pulling 20Mbps I would expect it to show this via the IoT vlan but it does not.
 also the traffic analysis tab does not show hardly any data for any nodes connected. for example i have run about 10 speed tests and downloaded a 1.1gb iso from my pc, yet it only shows 7.86MB of data logged.
 is this just a bug with the EdgerouterX?
 TIA
 ​
 Edit: so this is apparently because the interfaces only show the overhead of the vlans and not total traffic.

 I've got a requirement where I think Postfix would be ideal I just can't find/remember the exact term in Postfix for what I want to do so would appreciate a little reminder 😀
 I need a Postfix box on an internal LAN to accept mail from the internal /24 and if it's for @domain1.com or @domain2.com to forward it onto a smart host (the smart host will accept and relay from the IP of the Postfix box so no need to authenticate).
 However if it's for anythingelse.com I only want it to relay it using the same smart host if it comes from certain IPs within the internal /24.
 So mail from 192.168.1.0/24 to domain1.com or domain2.com = accept and relay.
 Mail from 192.186.1.10 and 192.168.10.15 to anydomain.com = accept and relay.
 There are no local mailboxes in use.

 Last year I was hired by a company here Denmark to be an IT admin and recently I was given the task to build a troubleshooting lab for the Network/Security engineers.
 The objective of this lab is so that when they face a problem with a customer's device (which is in production), they can quickly spin up a VM in our lab environment and run tests on it.
 We will use a single server running VMware EXsi for the VMs.
 Ideally I would like to give the engineers the freedom to create their own VMs using some type of GUI (instead of keeping that extra administrative work for myself), but I also want to restrict them from creating a ridiculous amount of VMs, or assigning a ridiculous amount of resources to the VMs, and Ideally this would all have AAA (so I can know who created what and when).
 What tools do you recommend for a setup like this? This is my first time leading a project like this and I am a bit lost !
 Thank you in advance!

 I already opened a post, for another question. This one is partly a rant, but also partly a call for help.
 This is about an argument I had with my colleague. I don't know where he comes up with such ideas.
 We tasked to conceptualize a new ip address concept for our location. We have 200-250 employees, everyone with notebooks and smartphones. In total we come up with 500~ unique ip addresses.
 We don't expect to grow much, because we are limited by the size of our offices.
 We have 3 buildings, each with 3 floors. I rather expect, that we will build smaller branched offices in the future, if we ever fill up our current location.
 Thats all fine. Basic stuff. Thats like the 1,2,3 of a sysadmin. I did stuff like that in school and got tasks like this even as an exam …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just curious if anyone can share their solution to keeping their fleets laptops in laptop carts updated.
 We will have a small time frame coming up in the school system with no students or teachers.
 Trying to find a solution to-Have most of the fleet's Windows laptops always up to date with their patches and etc.(as close as possible)-Able to keep the laptops updated all the time-Don't need staff/us to run to every laptop all the dam time to update it ourselves this takes a really long time. There's just too many laptops
 Solution I was thinking- We will go to every laptop this time make sure we push the bios config to power on every Sunday- SCCM will do the updates for us just like how we always been..
 Any recommendations or advice as well from your own solutions that is keeping your laptop's updated in their carts? Any GPO's that we can push to the laptops as well. The laptops are always plugged with power via the usb-c power adapters. We have ap's in every room that has a laptop cart.
 Its just getting tiresome to do all hunt down the ones that hasn't been patched manually as the #of laptops is growing and its not all in the same building. Thanks for your help and any advice is welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a relatively new concept to me. I understand how load balancing will can be used to send requests to multiple servers so that one server is not overloaded. But the part I don't understand is how do you make the servers always be duplicates of each other? For example if it's cloud storage, one person edits or uploads a new version of the a file, how does the other servers know there was a change? And how do you make sure they are all up to date with the latest changes? 
 I don't understand how you setup the replication portion of it. 
 Can someone point me into he right direction to understand this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone,
 I seek for aid in conceptualizing a new network for my company.
 During my conversations with my colleague we came up with the question where to put the default gateway of our subnets.I remember that my old teacher back in school told me, to put the default gateway at the end of a subnet. e.g. 192.168.178.254/24 I can't remember why again. Something with growth and expansion of the network. I can't get it together anymore.
 Though, from my old companies I know that they all put their default gateway at the beginning of a network, e.g. 192.168.178.1/24
 What do you think? Is there an actual reason for the one or the other, or is it just personal preference?
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very weird question I know.
 But I figure if anyone has been around long enough in technology that remembers anything about this, its like Sysadmin and perhaps a handful of Guru's here. 
 So from 2018-2020 I worked for a Newspaper IT department in my first real IT job .
 To place our ads we used a certain program and boy howdy this sucker was old.
 I never got a specific timeframe on its age , I heard some staff saying they had seen a version of it or something similar to it when they worked in the 70's/80's, I knew support for it ended like in 2009 and the interface was pure keyboard based and looked like something something that would not have been out of place on DOS with its blocky text and minimal colors.
 I am fairly certain we were the last company in the world using it, we had to modify it to work on modern Mac OSX and windows machines , run it deep in wineskin.
 The thing was so old, that whenever it crashed or corrupted the staff just installed a fresh zipped copy on the affected workstation and it was so small that you could transfer it quickly, even on a Apple Remote Desktop setup, it transferred in like 10-15 seconds. 
 Now I am not sure if our versions name was changed after all the modifying or all the companies assets were barely online, but when I search for it (mostly to share with people to show them the older stuff I have worked on), all I get is info on cameras or wall mountings.
 ​
 Was curious if anyone knows what I am talking about and its proper name or even some screenshots of it in all of its DOS glory.
 Not a big deal, but I thought I'd ask

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone! I´m sorry for my bad English, I from Argentine and don´t speak English.
 I currently work as Sysadmin in Argentine Hospital. I am the first in the IT position in this health company. The basic infrastructure was made by two guys many years ago and today it's my turn to "professionalize" the area. Not a minor fact: It is my first job as a SysAdmin and after 6 months I feel ready to start putting everything together seriously.
 The service consists of the following terminals:
  
Forty (40) Personales Computers with Windows 10 (1 Standard user and 1 administrator user for restriction on each PC). 
 Printers and access points (At the moment I am not interested in this point). 
  
I need to implement a:
  
Ticket System (because currently I only use Gmail to manage orders.) Which do you recommend? Where possible free.
 A software for remote access to the terminals. I currently use TeamViewer. I was looking at Radmin, maybe TW will change it to Radmin. What do you think? I like the Radmin interface better and how little intrusive it is.
 
A software to monitor the network. Here I am adrift, any recommendations or advice? The network consists of a Mikrotik Router, a main non-manageable Switch and then an access Switch per floor that distributes to the terminals via UTP Cat5e. 
 
Any other point that they consider necessary to implement...
 A simple network schematic...
 
 What I appreciate most are the advice or experiences. I read in Google and use Udemy to learn right now, I survived out of necessity. But I want to start professionalizing myself and professionalize my modest system.
 Thank you in advance.
 ¡Gracias!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for an option for re-deploying some Surface Go tablets as wall mounted Spotify kiosks. I've tried the usual UWP kiosk powershell in Windows but Spotify is strange in that it appears it is now an plug-in for the xbox game bar UWP app. It can't be found in the GUI to set up a kiosk app, and if you try to run SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Spotify it just gets stuck in a loop until I remote powershell in and remove the kiosk setting. If you use SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Widget it displays "We weren't able to start your app." and an error code which indicates an operation was not supported.
 I've considered Edge fullscreen but the web-based can only cast to Spotify Connect devices they've previously registered and as this is at a school, giving access to an unauthenticated web browser is something I'd rather avoid.
 Another potential is BlissOS (Androidx86) but then I need to put in time to get that working with an MDM if it is even possible.
 If I can get it working, I'll design a secure-ish wall mount and 3D print as many as needed. (we have 30 of them) I was also considering using them for control panels for certain building automations (is there a more commercial focused option like homeassistant?) and also for using with Xibo for digital signage.
 Background: I'm the solo IT person for a special school, always looking for cheaper ways of doing things which make these kids' lives a bit better. The more I can save, the more I can spend on IT based programs which help their learning. If I had loads of money, I'd just buy iPads for this. Reason we have Surface Go is we're a 100% windows school, no apple, no Google Apps Suite Workspace.

 Is there anything else than needs to be done to make this work?
 Is there any method to view which user account or accounts logons are currently cached on a device?

I'm in a very large organization right now and don't like the sheer size and complexity of the environment just to get something done. I'm afraid a defense contractor would be the same simply because they're working with the military. 
 I don't have a clearance but don't think I'd have a problem getting one.

We don’t have a ton of servers that are doing a whole lot. Most of time time is spent on our network. I took over a role that has not been too well defined. My boss pretty much hired me not knowing my technical skills, and thought that if I didn’t do well technically than I could at least be the IT project manager. 
 I’m the only Sys admin, and there are two help desk guys who don’t know really anything about servers or networking. I take some escalations, but not many.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a hilarious scenario at a school I provide IT support for.. Its one of those things that happen in IT where if I were to tell someone they would instantly think it was bs. And in the moment you don't quite believe whats happening yourself.
 So, this school they have a 40mbps VDSL line. As you can imagine with over 200 devices on the network at times this is pretty slow. Today the download speed was 0.4 mbps with a 800ms ping. How they survive on this I will never know. I'm constantly trying to get them to upgrade to fibre but they just do not have the budget to do that. There network equipment is a mess too, they have a Dell Sonicwall router about 12 year old and Cisco switches from about 10 years ago. They recently upgraded a couple of switches to unifi and how have unifi ac pro access points.
 ​
 Today I was going round seeing if anyone had any issues in their classrooms and a staff member approached me asking why they had been asked to turn off ALL devices in their class. I walked around and everybody was turning all their devices off, it felt like apocalypse scene in a movie. The person who told them to turn everything off I went and asked her why this had happened and her response was "I needed to download a large file and the internet is too slow". I couldn't stop laughing. I had never heard of anything so outrageous in my life. The funny thing was, 75% devices dropped off the network and the speed was 2mbps download. 
 ​
 Its so hard working with schools to improve their tech when they quite literally don't have the budget to upgrade stuff. They upgraded their servers a couple years ago but that was because they literally failed constantly.
 ​
 Thought this story was too funny not to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context I am mainly a wireless guy (RF design/testing), with some light networking background. I am looking at rolling out a new Meraki 9164 access point deployment. It is my understanding that to use 6 GHZ and 802.1X authentication I am required to use WPA3-Enterprise encryption (Also see Meraki article titled "WPA3 Encryption and Configuration Guide". With WPA2-Enterprise I was able to use EAP-PEAP MS-Chapv2, but I am getting the feeling that PEAP MS-Chapv2 is not supported on WPA3 Enterprise? Meraki's article states:
 To use WPA3 enterprise, the RADIUS servers must use one of the permitted EAP ciphers:
  
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  
So I am hoping to find the answer to a few questions:
  
Does WPA3 Enterprise support only EAP-TLS?
 
Is this ubiquitous to all WPA3 enterprise deployments? (standards based requirement)
 If WPA3 Enterprise supports supports other EAP types, what are those? Source would be great!
 As I am not very familiar with EAP-TLS, does that mean I would be required to have Server AND CLIENT certificates?
 
Are there any straightforward guides to learning more about EAP-TLS and how to deploy?
  
Thanks for any insight!

 Would it make sense to create one Network SSID to apply to devices at all locations at once or is that even possible?
 The problem we are having is that we are running out of DHCP leases on our current wireless network and would like to sparse out users/devices so that more IPs will become available.
 Should we have a unique scope/VLAN created for each location separately or would it be possible/more efficient to have the entire wireless network we are creating for all locations being associated with just one scope/VLAN?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 In my assignment I have to design a network with following components:
  
Firewall (Fortigate) x 2 
  
ISP #1 (Primary) 
 ISP #2 (Secondary/Backup) 
 Backbone Switch x 2 
 Switch Stack (3 switches) 
 Network Printer 
 Server 
 Laptop - using WiFi 
 Access Points - 2 Units 
 
  
Configuration: 
 ● Both of the firewalls should be in cluster (HA) 
 ● Both ISP’s should be in active-passive mode with dependency with the firewall cluster. 
 ● Each device(server, printer, AP, laptop) should have its own VLAN and be isolated from the other devices. 
 ● Backbone & Stack switches should be on the same VLAN as the laptop. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I drew up this diagram: https://ibb.co/fxnWW51
 What is the best practice for this kind of network?
 Where i get confused is - where would you configure routing and interVLAN traffic? On Fortigate or core switches. In my research I'm getting mixed suggestions - Some say that core switches are for routing, when others say that core switches have to be as fast as possible and have minimal tasks dedicated to them.
 I would appreciate any kind of help, and sorry for stupid questions.

 We have a C9200L-48P-4X which has a single port, which happens to be empty, in an up state with a solid amber light. The switch sees itself as a cdp neighbor on this port, showing the same port ID for both sides:
 usnosw12-113#sh cdp n Device ID Local Intrfce Holdtme Capability Platform Port ID usnosw12-113 Gig 1/0/2 165 S I C9200L-48 Gig 1/0/2 
 There's no config on the port. I'm thinking it's just a repair case but I wanted to ask in case there's a chance it's something else.

Open Registry Editor
 Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RasMan\PPP\EAP\13
 Create DWORD key TlsVersion value FC0
 Gpupdate /force
 reboot
  
Done
 ​
 Weird problem.
 We have a couple users who snuck in and updated their machines to Windows 11 before we locked that down. We also have a group policy that we designed for Windows 10 that deploys the info for all the SSIDs across all offices to all computers. It is set to reach out to RADIUS to verify ID, so users never have to log in.
 This GPO works great on all Windows 10 machines, and according to our other SysAdmin, it worked fine for 11 until 22H2 dropped. Now, users see the network that was pushed by GPO, but it tells them they "Can't connect to this network".
 I can log in to one of the Win11 machines and manually tell it to get on the "Hidden Network" and give it all the info, and that manually configured one works fine.
 If I check the GPO on the Win11 machine, Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies and open the policy we created, then open the properties of the network, then go to the Security tab. I verify that it is using Secured Password (EAP-MSCHAP v2) as the Authentication Method and click Configure, but the EAP MSCHAPv2 properties window that pops up has the "When connecting: Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any) box unchecked and is greyed out. On the Win10 machines, though, that is checked.
 Given that, I'm assuming that the reason they can't connect is due to the Windows logon name and password not being pushed. Just not sure why the GPO isn't configuring that correctly in Windows 11.
 Any thoughts?

 EDIT: I have eve-ng pro 5.0.1-20, it's recently installed. I think I helped my ssd out a little bit with these fixes:
  
edited these two lines in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
  
​
 # max_binlog_size = 100M skip-log-bin 
 Since I have no plans on making this a cluster server for eve in the future I just disabled the binlog/logbin feature. This partially helped my problem, I noticed slightly less disk IO, but there was still a lot. It maybe decreased things by 10-25%. But the overall disk usage will not continually climb from the /var/lib/mysql/binlog.xxxxxx files.
 iotop showed this yet: 567481 be/4 mysql 0.00 B/s 551.38 K/s ?unavailable? mysqld [ib_pg_flush_co]
 ib_pg_flush_co was still writing a lot. So I did an strace of that process and it was doing io_submit about once a second. I just happened to google the very last option in the mysqld.cnf file "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2". A quick google suggests that it forces a write cycle once a second.
  
 edited "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2" from 2 to 1 (the default), and restarted mysql again.
  
EDIT2: This only worked temporarily. After a reboot of the eve-ng box the issue came back. and ib_pg_flush_co is still writing to disk constantly.

 We are planning on connecting two switches together with the QSFP-40G-SR4-S and I have to order the correct leads.
 Since its a transceiver to-transceiver that would make it a type B connection. 
 According to the Cisco webstie it says:
 QSFP-40G-SR4-S
 40GBASE-SR4, 4 lanes, 850 nm MMF
 MPO-12
 Does it mean that when Im placing an order for the correct lead, it should be 8 fibres, Type B Cross polarity and Female to Female or Male to Male? Please help... TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work help desk and had someone put in a ticket annoyed that Cisco WebEx was a startup program. He said he never used it, so I went ahead and disabled it as a startup program and uninstalled it. 
 ​
 He emails me back saying it still starts at log in. So, I used sysinternals to disable it. I continued to leave what was left installed and disabled as I didn't want to make a small complaint turn into a potential mess. 
 ​
 A program should not require sysinternals to disable a program at startup. A program should not persist after uninstalling it.

 Small-Medium sized org, internal IT. Small department. 
 I set a project to get an internal CA set up for an internal web cert. 
 After 3 days of connection reset issues, amongst others... (SAN!!!) - it's working! I did have to disable TLS 1.3 though as it was causing the connection reset errors. Looks like the handshake was being rejected. 
 Feeling proud as I've done this all on my own. 
 However, I did only set up a root CA (I know a subordinate is really meant to be set up) but we're tight on Server licenses and it's for two informational reporting internal sites accessed by a couple of departments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone,
 Our org currently uses AnyConnect VPN for remote access. We have it configured for the Windows pre-logon as well, and we instruct people to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer. Our reasoning was because things like GPOs and logon scripts seemed to "work best" or even possibly only work if the user signed into the computer while being "on network"(with the VPN active).
 I have the ability to switch our AnyConnect VPN setup to have our firewall point directly to Azure for MFA purposes, but that config does not support the ability to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer. Wouldn't that be a problem again for logon GPOs and logon scripts?
 What do other orgs do to solve for this that have users sign into a VPN AFTER signing into their computer instead of before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 Recently i've been hired as a server administrator for an IT company in my area. I got the job because my education background is in software development and they want to train me as a server admin + use my programming skills for powershell scripting & automation.
 The onboard training is totally fine, I'm comfortable in the M365 admin portal and AD seems straight forward enough, but where I have no actual training (outside of a brief course I took semester one) I was wondering if there are any recommended online courses? Through Udemy or somewhere else. When I was learning programming the Odin Project helped a lot with my understanding of the webdev side of things so I was hoping there's something similar for sys admin.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated, otherwise I'll just pick the highest rated course on Udemy lol.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've been at the same company for nearly 15 years, late 30's. My salary is at $110k which for here in Ohio has offered a good life. I've been debating back and forth about applying for other jobs to at least test the market to see what I'm worth. I'm a Senior Monitoring Engineer and work with tools such as App Dynamics, Splunk, DataDog, etc. My wife and I have a baby on the way (our first and only) so I've been pondering if I should explorer other options to increase my salary.
 However, things are going very well where I work which is a good thing. The company I work at has been very stable, work life balance is excellent with typically no more then 40 hours per week, remote 4 days per week, have 6 weeks of vacation, and the other benefits (7% 401k matching, health care is under $200 a month for a family, bonus is usually around $7k) are good as well. I've seen some other job listings in my field would offer a good bump in pay but I'm hesitant to even leave. I start thinking "Is now the right time to really leave with the way the economy is", and "my wife and I having a baby on the way, stay where it's been stable". On the other hand I also think "I've been here nearly 15 years, let's see what's out there and what I'm worth". Maybe there's no harm in at least applying for some of these positions.
 What would you do? How much is stability, work life balance and remote work worth to you?

 Do computer and user authentication require separate EAP-TLS Network Polices or can they share they same one combined? When I've combined them into the same policy with every combination of User, Computer and Windows groups, it didn't work.

That being the disclaimer..... the sales managers have said text your customers, the sales team did with great success and close deals.... Now they need to get away for a day or week for vacation or for health reasons..... We can't take care of the customer because they leave their cell phone at home. (I would too if I was on vacation)....
 So I am trying to get inside sales access to all their imessages for a small period of time. 
 I tried Verizon message plus, but deleting all history with a customer of a few years is a hard push back and you lose historical and disable imessage all together... Clunky. 
 I have found that if I take an iPhone with no service and hook it up to the wireless, sign into their icloud on the phone I can text! But I still have to deliver a spare iPhone to someone to cover..... I have thought about a virtual macos that people can remote into.... But before I reinvent the wheel again... Is there something easier? Anyone in my boat? Thanks redit kingdom

 I know the theory (mostly) and the commands, but what I'm struggling with is that I've been told that VLANs should each have their own subnet if best practices are followed which makes sense to me. 
 However as far as I'm aware you can't configure subnets on a layer two switch. It needs to either be a router, or a layer three switch.
 Bearing that in mind how is it possible to have multiple VLANs on a single layer two switch whilst ensuring that each VLAN has its own subnet. It doesn't seem possible to me.
 I asked my lecturer but found my questions leading in circles. The lecturer confirmed that you can't subnet ports on a layer two switch, but then when I said "So you can't have a subnet for each VLAN at the layer two switch then (unless you're only using one VLAN for all ports)?" and was told: "Yes you can". And repeat.

Little tasks like do X, then repeat 70+ times are good for security but there must be a better way. Unfortunately we are on windows so all the linux thing's I'm thinking of aren't going to work.
 X could be any combination of these; 
  
start/stop service
 place a provided file in a location (not shared folder)
 read & report contents of a text file
 run a executable
 pretty much anything you can do CLI
  
For example at the moment I find myself updating OpenVPN. Place the provided msi in Downloads, stop the service, run the installer, check for installer errors, start service, after 1 minute delay open the OpenVPN log and review for errors. The error review in this case requires a human but if it simply dumped the log file somewhere I can get to it on a orchestration machine, renamed it with what server it came from that would be perfect. 
 I'm searching and finding a LOT of posts about automating windows updates, but I think we finally have WSUS under control.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my situation. I had created a user's shared mailbox and I disabled the user because he quit his job. Everything was fine the mailbox was working and had all the emails. Then a month later I got the same person's job, so I created an AD user with the same name, assigned groups and etc. And what happened was that AD got synchronized with Azure and that mail also got synchronized and left empty. So do you know if there is a way to restore that mail somehow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running one of my first projects as a SysAdmin(well, as an Enterprise level SysAdmin, I've done little projects like getting a small office of about 15 people setup for remote work when Covid hit), and thats running a pilot program for migrating users from Windows 10 to Windows 11. 
 I've already created a guide for the actual process of setting up Win 11 on their new laptops, but I still wanted to create a little fact sheet of changes between Windows 10 and 11. This is for an insurance company, so the changes should be focused more on GUI changes rather than changes to things like performance or new widgets(for the most part, if the software isn't in our Company Portal, we don't want them installing it anyway). 
 I personally haven't used Win 11 that much(the project kind of got sprung on me short notice) so simply writing the differences I've noticed might not be too helpful and most articles I've read only give a nod towards look and feel changes then focus on things like gaming performance. 
 I don't mind doing the actual reading myself, so links will be enough, but if anyone has brief summaries of changes, that would also help immensely. Thanks in advance.

 I might need your insight here ! As we are moving out of sccm to WS1, our security department is quite demanding regarding our packaging standards.
 Basically, in our packages we might have "sensitive information" ( licence server , accounts , database ...) Plainly visible in scripts ( most of time we are using PSADT ) and they want us to encrypt / hide as much as possible these data. 
 File Encryption seems quite difficult to setup for such purposes (due to find a way to make the package usable through WS1, and decrypt it on devices !) , Hide through full encapsulation in .MST / MSI might cause tons of rework and aditiional loads... Any idea on your side ? Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we've got a bit of an annoying issue with some Windows 11 field devices. They use some in-built 4g connectivity when out and about.
 The issue is that when in patchy signal, the AOVPN tries a few times to connect and then stops trying to auto-connect.
 This appears to happen only for Windows 11 devices. There doesn't appear to be a GPO option to force the auto-connect functionality back on.
 Another issue is that we can't disable the option to untick 'Connect Automatically', so the user can untick it and the VPN won't automatically connect. Is there any GPO or setting that I'm missing which will help? 
 I'm aware that this is a 'minor' inconvenience which could be solved with User Training but management have insisted that these field engineers are dumb as bricks and will just complain so it's easier to just get the VPN to try all the time constantly.
 I'm looking into a scheduled task fired on Network Connection successful but wanted a second opinion. Any ideas?

 I have a scenario that I need to get some clarity on as I cannot find any real answers online.
 We have Macbooks that are on Apple Business Manager and the company also wants to enrol them into Intune to deploy policies and profiles etc in line with company security policies. However, they would also like the Macbooks to be able to sign in with AAD credentials rather than AD credentials. Is it possible to link ABM with both Intune and AAD, rather than Intune and then configuration profiles to setup directory utility for AD?
 I see articles around setting up a Federation between ABM and AAD: Intro to federated authentication with Apple Business Manager – Apple Support (UK) but then is this the same as this: Tutorial: Configure Apple Business Manager for automatic user provisioning with Azure Active Directory - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn 
 With the above, can we then still utilise automatic enrolment into Intune with ABM like this: Enroll macOS devices - Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager | Microsoft Learn

 ​
 We are making some changes to our environment in regards to allowing AAD groups to be synced on prem, basically so certain groups are mirrored across the board.
 However once we enabled group write back against a set of groups we started getting the following error.
 ​
 The sync rules in scope have a mix of Persistent and ExecuteOnce attribute flows for the same destination attribute: msExchMailboxGuid
 ​
 at Microsoft.MetadirectoryServices.SyncRulesEngine.JoinModule.ValidateAllApplicableSyncRules(IEnumerable\1 applicableSyncRules)`

 at ManagedSyncRulesEngine.Synchronize(ManagedSyncRulesEngine* , CCsObject* sourceCsObject, CMvObject* mvObject, SynchronizationOperation operation, Char** error)
 InnerException=>
 none
 Native call stack: 
 ​
 Not exactly sure what this is? I assume its to do with us pointing on prem AD to look at mailboxes in Azure? we had no choice to do this as our move to Azure was in an emergency response.
 ​
 Any suggestions, currently we are just wanting to get the basic sync between on-prem and AAD working until we can figure out the rest, but we get this error on most if not all users.
 ​
 Thanks!!

 I'm testing Winget with intune in our testing environment, quite a useful tool to keep software updated! In our production environment, though, we have a particular network which is HW firewalled except for some web addresses, so in that context Winget is not able to communicate externally. At the moment it seems to me there's no proxy support in Winget, so I was wondering if there's a simple solution on how to allow winget to operate also on that limited network.

 Since the Apple ID's that they are currently using are all created with their company emails. Will the only real change be that the accounts are changed from a personal ID to a company ID?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins, I need to run a sanity check hope you can shed some light.
 I've inherited an environment, I'm still discovering and learning about it. It's an on-prem bare-metal/VMware, public cloud is minimal and completely independant. One concern that I have is that I'm seen some odd DHCP reservations for productions servers.
 To give an idea, I've seen DHCP reservation for MS-SQL database server, Domain controllers (all of them), Application Servers, anything that seems to be a production server where many people connect to, it is likely to have a reservation.
 Then in some cases, not all of them, the server has a static IP address assigned, despite of having a reservation. And you probably guess it, the IP address statically assigned to that server is in the DHCP range where other Desktop computers are also connected. This causes that the DHCP report the reservation as inactive.
 From the other side of the fence the monitoring system which is simple doing ICMP every once in awhile detects that host is down. There are no connectivity problems in some occasions when I manually check.
 In some other instances the ESXi web UI is inaccessible, I've experienced myself a duplicate IP caused by one of my computers that took the exact reserved IP address which belongs to that ESXi.
 My question is simple. Is this a normal practice to heavily rely on DHCP reservations to manage mission critical servers IP addressing? My personal bias to decimate that configuration. Go back to traditional static IP addressing, pushing the DHCP range to leave room for server addressing.
 On what scenarios a DHCP reservation would make sense to keep when dealing with servers that run network services that should be available to employees.

But it's the data bit that I'm trying to work out at the moment. I will also have 2 other backups of my data, one on an external drive and one in the cloud. But I was wondering if I can update my OS without moving any data.
 I want to create a bootable partition in RAID 1 across x2 NVMe or SSD drives for the OS and have all my data on x4 High Capacity 7200RPM drives in a RAID 10 btrfs partition. That way, in theory, I can install a new OS, log in and have all my data still there on the other partition. Is this right/possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, hoping to get some pointers on a planned SharePoint migration. Mainly around Teams setup as each site will likely be Teams enabled.
 I understand there are varying degrees of complexity depending on depth of Teams integration but have narrowed it down to 3 options.
  
Setup each department with their own site and dump folders alongside General. No private channels at this stage but, if setup down the line, there'll be nothing in General for users who are added (I understand the new Shared Channel option fixes this but seems fine to just keep everything alongside General anyway. Users can't delete the General folder but can delete the contents).
 Setup one site and create Private channels for the various departments. Easier to manage from a permissions standpoint as we can delegate channel owners to add and remove members. Downside is limit on number of private channels per team (will probably be under that though). I can map private channels to File Explorer but the name doubles-up (can fix this by customising the desktop.ini file).
 Let SharePoint migration tool dump everything to one site and call it a day. Deal with permission changes as needed.
  
Also keen on references to other guides or scripts for checking file conflicts outside of the SharePoint migration tool. Been trying to research best practices for a while but the info keeps changing since the platform keeps evolving. Also saw a guide about using metadata rather than folders so they're accessible from more than one location but that seems like even more work/complexity.
 TIA

 What I have done in this case is install the WeChat UWP app from the Microsoft Store to at least limit it's access because UWP Microsoft Store apps are supposed to be Sandboxed.
 What has now happened is that the UWP app has been pulled from the Microsoft Store and the only one in there now is one which requires "Uses all system resources" and then prompts for Admin rights upon install just for good measure.
 I tried to outsmart them by using the wechat web app https://web.wechat.com/ and this worked for a while too. But now what happens is that when the user scans the code it then takes them a page which says that they need to install the Desktop app instead.
 This has been a blessing because now I have the justification to completely remove it from the computer and have it stay on their personal phones, under the threat of hijacking the entire computer.
 I just wanted to give others the heads up of what's going on.
 And also, to call out Microsoft for even allowing such malicious activity to occur in the Windows Store, when the original intent was to have every app Sandboxed except by special permission of having the app verified by them, which obviously they have not done by allowing an app like this to have full permissions and request admin rights to the whole system.

 I have an R740 Dell PowerEdge server with dual port 10GB Broadcom NetExtreme SFP+ Ethernet network daughter card where I've plugged in a SFP+ single mode fiber 10GB LR transceiver, brand name 10gtek part# ‎AXS13-192-10-Cisco2. I have connected a single mode fiber optic cable there and the other end on a quantum scalar library tape drive 8GB fibre channel connection(no transceiver needed there) but i see no link light status on R740's NIC. I performed a loopback test on the dual R740 SFP+ ports by connecting them to each other with same type transceivers of course and got green link lights. I'm not sure what to make of all this or where the incompatibility lies between all new equipment and accessories. The OS is Windows Svr 2019 and has all and the latest drivers. I'm certain the system doesn't have a fiber channel HBA as it utilizing the NDC card described. One of the SFP+ NIC port on the same card has an cat 7 ethernet cable connected also by transceiver and has no issues, status lights are green. I've tried swapping the ports I'm connecting the fiber but no luck. I'm very new with this type of networking and hoping someone more experienced can point out the obvious. Dell support says their hardware has no issues based on logs.
 I see someone here with a similar issue but their solution hasn't worked for me. https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/R740-Fiber-Module-issue/td-p/6089505

 We use them as a primary router that we sell as part of our WAN service offering, and the only real requirements we have are that it needs to support up to a 1gbps connection, support LTE and vDSL.
 We've been eyeing off the Cisco 900 series, but we're open to other options as we're quite flexible with what we go with.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on other models we could go with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All -
 I've been in the field for ~15 years now going through customers, VAR, and vendor life. I'm very well compensated and generally don't hate work.
 However, I'm very close to becoming Financially Independent (FI) /r/financialindependence/. I don't really feel like stopping work, but I'd sure love to not work full time. For someone who is CCIE level of skill what type of part-time opportunities might there be?
 I'm open to true PT or maybe working FT 6 months a year, maybe doing a contract part of the year then not working the other half. I was debating trying to reach out to some recruiters in my network to see if they get those types of opportunities'. I also considered teaching, but honestly it doesn't excite me a ton.
 Whatever I do I'd like to be able to take large chunks of time off to travel (2-3 months a year) and some decent PTO otherwise to enjoy time with my family.
 What options might you suggest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to setup LLDP on my Cisco 9300 switches to allow my Poly phones to determine their location for E911 on Zoom. I have only used CDP, and with the voice vlan, the phones figure out what vlan they need to be, and life's great. But, when I try to dial 933 to verify the more granular E911 location, it can't seem to sort out the MAC address of the switch it's connected to so it can be more precise.
 So far, I ran lldp run on the switch, and it seems to now be on. If I run show lldp neighbors, I get all the phones, APs, and other junk on the switch. But, the phone still doesn't seem to know what's going on. Running LDWin on a client machine to read the LLDP packets doesn't yield any results either. Either I'm getting erroneous results, or LLDP isn't configured correctly.
 Looking at the Cisco documentation, it looks like I may need to run lldp transmit and lldp receive on the specific interfaces, but that hasn't gotten me anywhere either. Oddly enough, the commands do not error out, but if I show the running config for the interface, those commands don't show up in the config. At the bottom of the post is the current interface config.
 I'm certain I'm missing something simple and obvious, but this is kicking my butt.
 Port config:

 The authentication popup from most of the O365 powershell modules - even the latest ExchangeOnline Powershell 3.0 - is actually rendered by internet explorer (Microsoft is an exception to their own forced deprecation), not edge, and cannot do FIDO2 keys.
 So, a password and MS Authenticator or another legacy MFA method that isn't hardware secured, needs to be an option for Administrators, the ones who really need the most security and should be using FIDO2. All because Microsoft is an exception to one of their own rules that they have assured the rest of the industry no one really needs exceptions to because re-developing for Edge is so easy and long overdue.
 Hypocrisy at its finest.

 Couldn‘t find Much on guidelines or whether its personal preference.

 I'm looking for a universal solution that allows for wireless screen sharing (i.e. presenting from a device to a large display in a conference room).
 To date, we've been using ClickShare since that seemed to be the most device agnostic solution, but now that a lot of newer computers (especially MacBooks) have completely gotten rid of USB type A connectors, we're finding it less suitable than it used to be. And, hard as it is to believe, we've actually had a non-zero instance of people leaving with the ClickShare buttons!
 MiraCast is a decent solution for Windows devices, but my understanding is MiraCast is completely unsupported on Macs.
 It seems like there are relatively simple solutions that can be made to work with certain types of devices (i.e. an AppleTV is simple for Macs), but finding a universal solution that works with Win/Mac (and ideally iOS/Android too) seems to be a challenge.
 In a perfect world, it seems like there ought to be some sort of lightweight software agent that doesn't require any client-side hardware (or admin privileges) and would work across all these device types. I.E. - post a URL in the meeting room - visitors go there to download the agent, which automagically connects them to the A/V system in the room. Does such a thing exist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I inherited this nightmare, it isn’t my creation. I’m just tasked with making this whole thing work and so far I’m at an almost complete loss on the best way to segment this mess. It’s a fairly large subnet class c /21 with everything (and I do mean everything) on a single network. One of the biggest hurdles that I’ve had is diagnosing where the current loops are due to the Unifi system meshing (if meshing is turned off, nothing works which tells me it wasn’t designed correctly to begin with). So I’m trying to come up with a new design that will use what I’ve been given (they went building to building instead of each building back to the core due to the costs for horizontal boring). I’ve got two actual routers (Cisco) and some newer Catalyst 9200’s which are capable of full L3 routing (full meaning they can use an actual routing protocol and not just static). 
 My first thought is to segment out each building with it’s own network and VLAN but I am at a loss on making it so everything can still get to everything (this is a live production/manufacturing facility so they cannot go down).The only way to really isolate the loops that remain (this network grew at rapid speed over about 20 years - things just kept being added on and not properly tracked) is to attempt to use the Catalyst devices as “border routers”. I’ve been working in this field for over 20 years and I can honestly say, this is the first network that hasn’t been a standard full mesh or hub and spoke design. So I’m reaching out to the wise folks on here to see if I’m going about this the right way or if perhaps someone out there has experience with such a thing and can give me some pointers. I’ve been removing every hub/non managed switch I can find as I come across them because they seem to quite literally be everywhere lol along with documenting how everything actually connects for future reference.

 Our current setup from top to bottom looks like this:

 Sagecom 5280 router doing the management, including a dozen or so reserved IPs, but not using the wifi portion of the router >>
 An older Netgear ProSafe 24 Port Gigabit Switch (unmanaged) which handles all ethernet connections, including >> 
 Synology NAS with VPN setup for occasional remote connections (pretty damn happy with this).
 Another unmanaged switch further down the line that was necessary to prevent me pulling additional ethernet cables quite a bit a way, that then serves:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been working at this medium sized corporation for a year now. It's all on-site, as they say they're a family business... That being said, a few duties of my job include, maintaining the corporate network, maintaining our cyber risk standards (updates, anti-virus, MFA, etcetc), and Helpdesk for other employees.
 What's interesting is that over the year, I've been introduced into a few of the other random things IT 'takes care' of.
 We have 2 restaurants in the building that both use an outdated POS system. The guy who maintained the backend left a few months back, so now I'm in control of adding food buttons, prices, taxes and making sure the numbers match in the reports. (That should be a finance dept. thing)
 I'm being trained in SQL, so that I can be a backup once our programmer leaves. But I really don't care for programming. We're looking into Interns/hiring so I don't understand why we just find someone who likes SQL.
 I also have to setup most of the meetings for the execs; Which I'm not really surprised about. Just annoying as it takes me away from what I was working on especially on their 'meeting days'.
 And, I've been making the graphics for a few displays in our employee break rooms that include whatever deals we currently have for employees, position postings, inspirational posts. We have a marketing\graphics team, but I think they don't even know about them.
 This seems to be a thing that happens in all departments though. My friend in Marketing gets the 'privilege' of driving the co-owner home when he has a fun night at the bar. Keep in mind the drive is 45 mins there and 45 back. And our AV guy has to change the movie that plays on loop in the co-owner's office whenever he calls.
 Overall it's a interesting place to work. Anyone else have some whacky side duties you got stuck with?

 Educating the users to go to Start, Clicking Their Profile and then Sign Out is too much for them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing a lab for a proof of concept using MPLS. I can get it running without issue if I plug the CE equipment into a gig port on the routers and do an xconnect from end to end. In the lab, not an issue, it just works. CE equipment on each end see each other as neighbors and L2 is good to go.
 What they want is instead have the customer plug into a switchport and then have the MPLS run on a router SVI from end to end, Router on a Stick style. They want it to be L2, so the CE equipment just sees us as a LAN. And they don't want to monkey with the client's VLAN tags...what goes in tagged on one side comes out tagged on the other. I can't get this to work in the lab.
 I've tried having the switchport as a trunk and just allow the VLAN associated with the SVI on the router. I've tried it as an all-in trunk. I've tried it as an access port. The CE equipment doesn't see each other.
 Am I missing something, or is this not possible? All of our gear is old and not getting any newer...the routers I'm using are 3800's, the switches aren't L3. Here's the port configs I'm using....
 Router 1:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/1.2050 description CE1 for VC2050
 encapsulation dot1Q 2050
 xconnect 10.30.30.254 2050 encapsulation mpls
 ;
 interface Loopback100
 ip address 10.30.10.254 255.255.255.255
 Switch 1:
 description CE1
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 2050
 switchport mode trunk
 Router 3:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0.2050
 description CE2 for VC2050

 xconnect 10.30.10.254 2050 encapsulation mpls

 During the past few months we made our first baby steps by deploying:
 - 2FA for domain admins (yes, I don't know why this was never a thing, but it tells a story)
 - On-premise password manager
 - Bitlocker
 - Changed some password of domain accounts that hadn't been changed in years
 ​
 This is all great, but it's not much. The management is quite strict about what security measure can be deploye, as it must not be too annoying for employees.
 What are the next steps to take? Annoying or not.

 Correct me if I'm wrong, but in order to deploy Defender for Endpoint, we will need to enable Co-management in SCCM in order to get the devices into Intune, and then onboard the devices into Endpoint via SCCM?

 We enrolled 10+ devices and they worked exactly how we wanted but we've been aiming to further streamline things so I've been tested by resetting my spare laptop.
 Unfortunately I've just started running into issues where my spare laptop and another (which just needed to be reset) that have successfully Autopilot in the past (and have had no hardware changes) have suddenly started failing to Autopilot and instead continue with the standard Windows setup.
 During the Autopilot process CTRL+SHIFT+D simply shows "User-based Azure AD Join - required error event data incomplete or missing"
 If I check the Event Log I can see
 "Event ID 704 - Autopilot downloader retrieved an empty profile for DdzZtdPolicyManager" where on devices it's been successful in the past we can see "Autopilot downloader retrieved a new profile for DdsZtdPolicyManager."
 Unfortunately I've not been able to find anything useful for diagnosing why we'd get an empty profile. I've tried completely removing the device from Autopilot and AzureAD and then using Get-WindowsAutopilotinfo -Online from OOBE to push the serial and hash again but I continue to experience the same problem. The devices are still present in InTune and have profiled assigned.
 Just wondered if anyone had any pointers for diagnosing why we'd retrieve an empty profile before I bang my head on a wall with Microsoft?

 I've been using both pfSense and Synology's OpenVPN server options. Both work great but there is an issue on the pfSense server: when I access with a device through the VPN, it cannot ping or see Windows machines, unless I disable the firewall. But when I use Synology's OpenVPN, I don't need to disable the firewall. I suppose there's a solution that can be applied on the pfSense side, without having to mess around with Windows Firewall rules, but I don't know what should I do because I don't even know why these Windows machines are blocking that traffic.
 My pfSense is currently set in this way:
 - 1 port for WAN.
 - 3 extra ports for LAN that are bridged to work like a hub/switch. This bridge is the DHCP server.
 - Firewall rules to allow traffic between the ports on the pfsense mini-pc to the rest of the network. 
 Everything works just fine but when it comes to openVPN, I have the firewall issue with Windows.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks for the help! 🙏

 I've run wireshark scans both inside and outside the network. Outside the network it appears to connect via UDP while inside the network it appears to connect via HTTP. Outside the network there is never any problems and the loading takes much quicker.
 Issues I have encountered are slow typing within the app, having to end the RDS sessions and then connect the users again (sometimes this even chokes at first time login), and of course users not being able to login at all. This also happens on completely random computers throughout the month and NEVER at the same time. 
 They can hit the RDWeb url just fine and download the RDP app just fine, and we can use all other websites/apps just fine. It's just getting in and STAYING in that is an issue.
 I'm thinking there has to be a feature that prioritizes who or how many people can continuously connect to this app at the same time or something on the network.
 I'm also thinking that it has to do with the fact that we HAVE to use HTTP instead of UDP.
 Is there anything else we can try to stabilize the connection? Would looking into some event logs on the PCs help?

 I've tried server manager from RSAT, server manager from all 3 of our brokers, yet I'm given the same message, and at this point I'm stumped. My google searches are telling me to add them in server manager, but that's definitely not the issue.
 ​
 As well, the rest of the RDS environment is working perfectly fine. All users are connecting to all of our sessions just fine.

However, I found a new career opportunity that I cannot pass up and put my heart and soul into the resume/essay to get in...and now I can't get my mind off of this potential career.
 Main concern is that I'll be "let go" or terminated since my company can terminate "at will" meaning they could probably easily terminate me from this contract once I tell them about my wishes to pursue another career. Supervisor and I are on great terms but are at no means close or friends. 
 To anyone with experience in this situation, how would you notify your supervisor of this new job you want to apply for and explain that if you don't get accepted, you would still be happy to keep working in the current position?

Understanding the basics of HTTP and how it works is essential for anyone working in web development, system administration, or IT in general.
 HTTP is a client-server protocol, meaning that a client (such as a web browser) makes a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data. HTTP requests and responses are simple text messages, sent over the internet using the TCP/IP protocol.

 I find snap being super annoying and less convient to automate around than my trusty old APT. 
 I mean it's faster to type AND EXECUTE apt update && apt install -y python3-certbot than to first install snap, and then install certbot. What's the benefit of snap?!
 Am I just set in my ways and should learn to use it or do most of you also think snap is garbage and an extra layer that's not really neccessary?

 I am involved in migrating on-prem infrastructure to 365/Azure etc for many SMB's, but I just cannot get Sharepoint online working reliably. It seems to work fine for smaller sites, but the larger the customer, the more problems they have with it.
 I am migrating on prem shares into Sharepoint - giving each share its own site. I then either deploy the share via Intune so that it appears in the Explorer sidebar, or simply have the customer "add shortcut to OneDrive" 
 The thing is, I'm constantly having OneDrive sync issues. Either it gets stuck syncing, doesn't sync everything, gives errors when downloading cloud files through explorer etc, and it's overall a very poor experience for the customer. 
 Doing things via the web browser is fine, but doesn't offer the old school functionality of accessing files via explorer.
 What am I doing wrong? It's driving me up the wall! The amount of times I've had to reinstall OneDrive/resync data is absurd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Totally at a loss here, so wondering if anyone else has come across this.
 The firm likes to send out a monthly newsletter (amongst other things), and to do this, they use Mailchimp. This is fine, I've created the relevant DNS records and such, and all is well. However, the way Mailchimp links images rather than embeds means that Outlook doesn't display images by default. The only way around this, that I'm aware off, is to set the sender in Safe (Trusted) Senders and Domains for all users
 I've done this via a PowerShell script:
 ``` Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName user@example.com 
 $users = Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox 
 foreach ($user in $users) {
 Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration "$($user.UserPrincipalName)" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add="mail.example.com"} }
 ```
 I have also try to only do one user, eg. Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration "user@example.com" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add="mail.example.com"}
 Either way I do this though, the change shows up when I look at junk settings in OWA or Outlook 365 desktop, but within 10 minutes, it's no longer in there, almost as if the change has been undone
 If I manually add the domain to my safe senders list, it remains there absolutely fine, so I don't believe this is some rogue setting or script that's clearing out the safe senders list

 does anyone use Unimus for daily reports, or is it even possible? 
 My idea is to every night push config for basic stuff, version, serial, hostname, IP address, etc.
 That is not a problem, but I don't know how to extract that output to PDF, CSV or some other format. 
 Only thing that I found was in notification options that send me when mass push config is done, and on what devices was successful and on what wasn't.

 I'm having some intermittend network issues with a client that doesn't show anything related in network device logs, so probably client related.
 In the past I troubleshooted those issues with a kinda throwing star looking physical tap device and a laptop. But is there a hardware PCAP device that someone could recommend that is easily attaced to a port mirror on a switch that captures all the traffic, saves it as a PCAP for troubleshooting using Wireshark and possibly even have a web interface of some sort to download the PCAP files from?
 I'm unable to find a good tool online.
 That would really makes this process a lot easier because we'd be able to ship this thing to a client preconfigured and they just need to hook it up to a switch.
 Thanks!

 I'm looking to do the MS Azure Administrator Course during my free time off work.I have setup a basic on premise Windows Server 2022 for the labs that require on-prem activities.
 The question is more on the Azure licenses required to "fully" go through learning lab scenarios.
 I have registered for a free Azure account and gone through a few initial basic labs scenarios. But as i move on to further lab scenarios, i realise there are many options not available to me.
 I have seen that there is this "Pay As You Go" subscription and also subscriptions such as "Basic (Which is the free), Developer, Standard" and as well as others such as "P1, P2, etc"
 As this is for self learning lab scenarios, I would just need the functions there. There wont be 1000 users using the full MS Azure suite. There will only be 1 admin and 1 test user for the scenarios.
 Can someone anyone who knows or have gone through the same situation as me advise what is the most "basic" subscription to be able to at least have most of the functions to complete the AZ104 course/labs scenarios.
 Thanks in advance!!

 ​
 Questions to those who used Azure Virtual Desktop in their environment. I am new to Azure Virtual Desktop, and have a few questions that I am hoping some of you kind people might enlighten me on.
 (1) If we already have some Azure presence, like existing vNet, can we integrate it with AVD?
 (2) If we can't integrate it with our vNet, what are other options (like using client VPN, things like that)?
 (3) From the cost perspective what are the options if we have general users and more power users What is a better way to organize those?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 i need some help on our rds hosts. Some specifiations:
 We have 6 RDS (Server 2019) and one Broker for about 220 user. All RDS have 16 Cores and 64 GB Ram and sitting on a full flash SAN. No GPU. All virtualized on Hyper-V 2019.
 Sometimes user reporting that the server feels slow. If i go to the user and look at his problem i can confirm this problem. The monitoring of the host itself seems okay. CPU wise we are about 20 % with some peaks, but very rarely over 80 %. RAM wise also about 60 %. Disk i/o and network are not real latency. 
 The problems for the users are mostly slow responding applications (not crashing) while moving the windows, latency on typing in different applications, and some other stuff. 
 For a small test i removed our anti virus (Sophos) but that does not help.
 If i read some old threads here on reddit most other people have much more user per server without issues. So it does not seem an issue on the user/server ratio.
 ATM i'm thinking about buying a hardware server with an GPU to test it. Hyper-V does not really support GPU partitioning or passthrough. We tried RemoteFX last year, but that does not really work.
 So maybe some of you have some input where i can solve my performance issue on these server.
 Thanks.

 The reason is I am using leaf switches between spine and core, and in the event of a spine failure I need the end client in the leaf to have its port disabled.
 For redundancy purposes. So let's say if one port would fail, I would need the other port to fail too.
 I am not sure if this is possible to program or there is this protocol.
 Switches are Catalyst 9300 and CBS350 X

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody,
 Brief context: We have(had) 2 DCs, but one got corrupted during a server migration (things seemed fine for a good while, I was sleeping post-surgery but my director and team member didn’t want to wait until the next Friday, also didn’t follow my migration procedure but it’s fine) and we ended up seeing SID errors in the AD resulting in newer user accounts being auto-deleted, etc etc.
 Troubleshooting went nowhere.
 Solution was: shut off DC2 and see if DC1 has issues by itself. It didn’t. Awesome.
 Now: DC1 is online, DC2 is offline but never demoted (and VM has no NIC config), DC02 (new VM) is a trigger pull away from backing up DC1.
 Questions: 1) If I add DC02 as a DC to the domain using “any dc” as a replication source, can I change this later? (Because I might like to make this “only DC1,” temporarily, which brings us to… 2) I want to bring DC2 online to properly demote it, but how can I ensure it won’t torpedo DC1 with bad/redundant records as soon as they reunite? Can I just (while DC2 still has no network config) set their sync relationship to be 1-way, give it network access again, demote it, shut it down for good? 3) Depending on 2)’s answer, should DC02 be held offline and not joined to the domain until DC2 is gone for good? Or is it safer to add it, test it, then shut it down while sorting DC1&2 so that, if they implode, I can just shut them down and bring up DC02?

We've been allocated the maximum available bandwidth, they have redone the firewall policies and available ports but still extremely weak connection with the outside.
 One thing that kept reoccurring in our conversations was their inability to maintain a stable connection while connecting to our servers and the fact that there is a loop in our network.
 My problem is that on local network everything seems to work perfectly fine. NAS file transfers are snappy, …]]></summary>

 ​
 I have a bootable usb that contains the OS for Dell Wyse Thinclient ( Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019 ).
 ​
 I have managed to clone the bootable usb locally using the Dell Wyse Imaging Tool, but I need to send this bootable USB to another location where I cannot send a physical USB thumb drive.
 ​
 How can I create an ISO of the bootable usb, so that I can send send that ISO to the remote computer, and from there, I would be able to use Rufus to create a bootable USB.

 Everyone on here seems stressed, overworked, and underpaid. I have a friend back at home starting his first full time firefighting paramedic job that tops out around $100k. Not to mention he’s keeping his part time gig so he’s going to be raking in around $130k-$140k a year. Also, as if that wasn’t good enough, he’s always able to play video games with me on his PS5 at the station while he’s not running a call.
 Am I getting into the wrong profession? I love technology and fixing things, but if I can get paid more to do a job that provides a better work life balance, I might have to consider doing that.
 Does anyone here enjoy their job? Is everyone here underpaid? Is this career just an endless pit of stress and boredom?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started running into an issue a few weeks ago where my domains' SSL wasn't being automatically renewed any more, and my certs started to expire, even though dehydrated was running daily as it should.
 It was running daily, but it was stuck: the process was still showing in ps the next day. Dehydrated and its helpers are all bash scripts, so I was able to throw set -o xtrace at the top to see what bash was running, and this was the offending block:
 cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` while ! valid_ip $cliip; do sleep 2 cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` done 
 This is a block of code in the Dehydrated helper script for Namecheap, that detects the running machine's IP. Except if the call fails, it gets stuck forever sleeping every 2 seconds and trying again. And as it turns out, the v4 and v6 subdomains to ifconfig.co were deprecated in 2018 and finally removed in January sometime.
 So the upshot is that v4.ifconfig.co/ip should be changed to ifconfig.co and your Dehydrated/Namecheap setup will come back to life.
 Also, set -o xtrace is a lifesaver for debugging Bash scripts that are getting stuck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a network with subnet mask as /22 (or 255.255.252.0) on all devices (and all devices are in a single network.)
 No sub-netting has been done (it was setup that from the beginning) and there are over 500 devices (User PCs and servers) Connected using L2+ switches (Cisco and D-Link).
 Frequently we find "LDB Loop detected" error message logged in our network switches even when there are no actual (physical) loop in our network and this message is logged in some switches and at random times. 
 After Auto error recovery timeout exceeds the set value of 60 seconds the port gets re-enabled and switches function normally without showing any loopback messages. During this entire time of event “No physical changes” were done to the network.
 I have checked all the switch logs and tried to find any physical loops in our network , but found none.
 I did a Google search to check if "large numbers of IP’s or devices can cause Loopback error " but could not find any posts regarding the same incident. One of the posts that I had gone through indicated that "large numbers of IP’s or devices" might not cause Loopback problem.
 My experience in Networking is limited. Any veterans could confirm if, 
  
Can Loopback error occur commonly if there are large numbers of devices in a subnet?
 Just wondering whether having a large single subnet (net mask 255.255.248.0) with 2000+ assignable IP addresses but with just 100 devices also causes Loopback error.
  
Any help is appreciated.

 I need to move the stubs without recalling the original file, but every method I have tried with Robocopy won't just copy the stub. I can't recall all the files to move them because I don't have enough room on my Pure SAN. I have also tried stopping the Archive manager services, but robocopy just throws access errors and copies over a 0k corrupted file.
 Is there a way to do this with Robocopy or better method?

I'd like to break this up to reduce data loss in the event we have failures and also to simplify our backups (VEEAM).
 Looking for advice on how I should separate this at the SAN level / VMware / Microsoft level ?
 My initial thoughts are:
  
10 x 10 TB LUNS
 10 x 10 TB DataStores VMF6 (I don't think vvols add any value but maybe I'm wrong ?) 
 Leverage Storage Spaces on Wiindows to consolidate the disks into one virtual disk ?
 Separate the data into separate basic disks and use DFS-N to present the share as a unified share ?
 
  
I have no experience with Storage Spaces but am quite familiar with LVM on linux so shouldn't be an issue. DFS I have a good handle on.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do networking in my day job, but I've been casually looking around at other infrastructure roles that are out there and a lot of them want CI/CD and Kubernetes. 
 Please correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is the having a CI/CD pipeline is primarily for if you have some kind of application that you're hosting and constantly developing. (And K8 is for managing all the docker containers running those applications). 
 Maybe I'm looking at this wrong, but I don't see how any of that interacts with a role where the primary task is maintaining and building a network. (And thus the dilemma (when it comes to applying for other roles) that I've never interacted with any of these things outside of youtube videos and playing around with small scale versions in my home lab) 
 I get the idea of treating your network configs as code and keeping them in some kind of VCS like git, but does anyone actually have a CI/CD pipeline for pushing networking config changes? How would you even write tests for something like that, that you could then put in some kind of automated pipeline?

Trying to convince my boss to abandon Cisco because I’m sick of them, so he wants to put together a list of alternatives. 
 After talking to our VAR and doing a lot of research, it seems like the top choices would be: Mist, Aruba, or Arista. Personally I’m leaning towards Mist, but curious to see what everyone else thinks. I like their management software and if they can actually reduce support tickets anywhere in the realm of what their salesperson claims it would be a huge benefit. 
 Any mist users out there? Or anyone who thinks Aruba/Cisco/Arista is a better option?
 Edit: to clarify, campus is how we refer to our corporate head quarters (mid-sized company with ~1k employees at HQ). We are not an actual college campus.

 We were cabling a server the other day and one link (10Gb fiber) just wouldn't come up on the designated port. We moved it to another port to test and still no light. However, it seems the test port was probably shutdown; as was the port we were trying originally. There was a mistake in the cabling documentation so they were plugging into the wrong ports.
 So I should just be able to fix the documentation and send the guys back out to cable it right? But I thought a port would still show some type of link lights if it was shutdown, which makes me think there's still something else broken if true.
 We did test the fiber cable, NIC, and GBIC on a known-working port and it all worked.
 I don't have physical access to this equipment to check for myself.
 Edit: this has been answered. Thanks!

 My question is - how does this happen? Can some endpoints prevent their hardware address from showing up in l2 tables somehow?

 But we have these CBORD devices that handle Student Payments (at Soda Machines, et al) and Card Swipy devices for CheckIn type things. When plugged into the Catalyst they work just fine. No PoE needed and they pull their reserved IP no problem. Can see it on the Catalyst CLI, can Ping it, everything is great. 
 Swap that plug to a Meraki switch and the port DOESN'T EVEN ACTIVATE. No link lights, nothing. As far as Meraki is telling me there is no device plugged into that port. I've tried multiple ports on multiple switches now - same issue. Works on Catalyst just fine, Meraki doesn't want anything to do with it. The VLAN in use is one of the most widely used VLANs but I still went up and down the line to verify connectivity. 
 Has anyone ever encountered anything like this?

 I hope some of you great people might be able to help. I’m conducting an experiment for my studies where I am measuring routing protocol convergence performance in a simulated and real hardware environment. 
 I am struggling to make sense of how to calculate the convergence itself. Do I ping the host on the other end of the network continuously, and then shutdown an interface and time a change or do I simulate a data packet through Cisco simulation during which I shutdown the port to see how the routing protocol reacts?
 For my simulated part I am using the CPT simulator. For my real hardware I plan on using a Wireshark. Has anyone any idea how to measure the convergence times? I have browsed through the net but not to luck so far. 
 Your help is greatly appreciated!

I have a site that typically has 80 users connected to the wireless at any given time. Daily total bytes pushed through the wireless is 1.4 terabytes (you read that right). As such, when I look at the speeds my clients are pushing, most are in the Kbps range, and some are in the low Mbps range (2-5Mbps per client). The site only has a 100Mbps pipe.
 Logically speaking, I have to imagine if my users are pushing 1.4TB through the wireless in 24 hours (site is 24/7), and the WAN pipe is 100Mbps, then the Mobility Express controller instance has to be rate-limiting the connections somewhere, independent of the maximum amount of bandwidth allowed per client slider under RF Optimization in expert view.
 Does anyone know, and if so, can you direct me to where I can tweak that? I'm getting slowness complaints from the site, but with 80 people using the wifi at that level of data, you kinda have to expect that no?

 The issue: password managers allow you to store things like TOTP (time-based) tokens in them. This is very convenient since you don't need to dig up a phone to log in, it can be auto-filled, and easily backed up. However, this is significantly degrading the security of having the second factor in the first place.
 Why it matters: multi-factor authentication is predicated on distributing security into multiple areas, so an account compromise requires significantly more effort. Typically, factors are "something you know" (e.g. a password), "something you have" (e.g. a phone or hardware token), and "something you are" (e.g. a fingerprint or other biometrics).

 I'm working on a moving project, we've rented a rack in a DC and want to move our whole infra there and I'd like to get rid of our tape library... I know they are immutable and great but I hate them and being the only guy that has to remember to buy, replace, store, and tag all the tapes is starting to suck.
 I've eyed this HPE storeOnce solution, we use Veeam for our backups, and the hypervisor is hyper-v (corporate decision) backups are running ok with a 3-2-1 approach, but as I said, being storeOnce with Catalyst kinda immutable I wanted to get feedback about this in order to hopefully switch to that instead of tapes. 
 My main questions are:
 - is the deduplication that good? I've read about a 20:1 ratio (for storage planning)
 - has the catalyst technology ever created issues in your environment? Have you replaced other immutable backup means like tapes with that? 
 Thank you!

 I hear a few people mainly in IT talk about how horrible their experience was while employed by an MSP provider. Does anyone have anything good to say about an MSP? Are they really that horrible? Just wonder if it really depends on WHO the MSP provider is. Just wanting to see the different responses thanks.

Obviously, there are great employers in bad industries, but those are the exceptions.

 We share two servers with a single user account among ourself for work. So having a way to figure out if someone else already has a active session to a machine will be great.
 I already tried using "qwinsta /server:serverIP" and "query session /server:serverIP". But both of these just return "No session exists for *". I tried googling more but haven't found anything solid. Also tried using "psloggedon \serverIP", this returns a list of users which includes the one we all use commonly. But every user has <unknown time>. This doesn't change even if I am connected to the machine or not. So not much of an help. If you guys know how to fix this or a workaround, it would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guys
 I work for a number of clients where we have used App-V as the primary packaging toolset for both traditional desktops and virtual clients hosted on tools such as Citrix and VMware. 
 With the support for App-V now gone and Microsoft's push towards MSIX I wondered what people's thoughts and experience around this is. 
 I did work on a client where we started using MSIX initially but found the feature set compared to App-V to be limited with an anticpitation that this would improve over time. 
 I've read the MSIX report cards that Tim Mangan does and see that the success ratio without additional tools such as PSF has a hit rate of 31% for MSIX compared to 90% for App-V.
 We are approaching a junction point in our application management stack and thinking of dropping Application Virtualisation in favour of using toolsets such as Winget and / or PSADT to wrap vendors installers. 
 Let me know what your thoughts are on this.
 Thanks.

 Basically I bought a machine for my home lab - Dell PowerEdge T40, with 16GB of RAM.
 I installed Win22 server on it, installed Hyper-V and a DC in that Hyper-V with 8GB of RAM.
 I wanted to create Windows Standard Core, and allocated 4GB of RAM but I got a message that says "Not enough memory in the system to start virtual machine".
 Now I thought since I have 16GB of RAM, a virtual machine with 8GB and another one with 4GB will run just fine.
 I allocated less RAM to my first machine, from 8GB to 4GB, and because it wouldn't install I tried again, allocating 2GB of RAM and it worked. I don't understand why it wouldn't let me use 4GB.
 ​
 Ammount of RAM on host - 16GB
 VM1 - 4GB
 VM2 - 2GB
 Host uses - 5GB
 So I have available 5GB of RAM.
 That being said, I don't understand why I couldn't allocate 2GB more to VM2.
 ​
 I know there is some allocation rule in HyperV I just can't find it, or I did and I still don't get it.
 How to calculate how many machines can I install and run with X ammount of RAM?

 This provider we hire would literally scour through EVERYTHING your company uses and touches … database/email/major applications/ banking credentials as well as the physical infrastructure and asset management and gives you the full good, bad, ugly on what is wrong security wise as well as inefficient structure or procedures to also show what can be done to automate and streamline management. And ideally this same company sells the services to execute too or there are recommendations on companies they take the results and offer services to fix and execute.
 Backstory: Recently joined a company as an executive and realize that its entire environment has been thrown together by a couple inexperienced IT support employees. No fault of their own, the company started mom and pop small business and rapidly exploded into a national player and these guys just kept the lights on. There is no asset management, no end point management, no understanding of how to streamline/control data, (literally zero governance), etc. To better know what we don’t know so we can add the right people to the existing team, we are hoping to pay lots of $$$$ to have a trusted company contracted to “fix” us up so we can take it from there.

 We don't want create from domain !!
 Soo , i create a user admin2 and a group Local Admins . At user i add in Administrator group and in Local Admins add at membres admin2
 Then i create a gpo : Edit ->Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Restricted Groups -> add group and then i add Local admin
 After in "this group is a member of" i add Administrator
 I went to the PC I'm testing cmd -> gpupdate /force
 I checked from cmd -> compmgmt.msc -> Local Users and Groups -> Groups -> Administrator and GPO works ok is apply . See the "AD\Local Admins"
 it is not possible to see only the name? Idk group name "Local Adminis" or only "admin" without "AD\..."
 Run with administrator write admin2 and password again working
 But I don't understand if at the moment the user is from the domain or is local .The question is if the user applies from the domain or is it local ? if it's local, how can i do it, there is another way?

 Just a quick query if someone could help. We’re currently moving our AD Connect to Server 2019. The server is in staging mode at the moment. 
 I noticed the first two initial Full Imports showed as:
 Adds: 997
 Updates: 327
 The subsequent delta syncs are OK. Before I move this out of staging mode, is there any concern? 
 these are the steps I followed: https://www.alitajran.com/migrate-azure-ad-connect/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow network engineers
 I am eager to develop greater networking skills and want to set up the most optimal and cheapest lab environment.
 For me, virtualisation is the best option for its scalability and variety. I have used both GNS3 and EVE-NG in the past (on my Windows computer with VMware Workstation/VirtualBox and even in the Google Cloud). I have enjoyed them both greatly but at the moment would choose EVE-NG.
 Right now I have a MacBook so virtualisation is not really an option for me since it is Silicon/ARM based. Google Cloud is too expensive for the amount of CPUs and RAM I need for a good lab (>24vCPU and 48RAM, also the resources are not always available in zones which is really frustrating). I could just buy a used bare-metal server for my virtualisation but I am not sure I will have room for it but it is an option I am considering.
 I need the to emulate different vendors so CML is not an option for me as well.
 Could you suggest the most practical and least expensive way to setup a lab?
 What has your experience been with it? Every little tip and suggestion is most helpful, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I'm new here. In short: there is a standalone server with Windows Hyper-V Server 17763. There is a VM with Veeam Backup&Replication, a VM with Windows Server 2019 (Active Directory), a VM with Windows 10, and a VM with Ubuntu (Samba). All machines in the test domain. I need to backup Windows Server 2019, windows 10 and ubuntu to a shared Samba folder. Ubuntu backed up without errors, but two VMs with Windows Server and Windows 10 back up with errors. Error example (from Edit Job->Guest Processing->Test Now):
 \green tick* Connecting to guest OS via RPC*
 \green tick* Testing admin$ share accessibility via RPC*
 \green tick* Testing guest OS connectivity via RPC*
 \red cross* Connecting to guest OS via PowerShell Direct*
 \red cross* Testing admin$ share accessibility via PowerShell Direct*
 \red cross* Cannot connect to VM*
 \green tick* Credentials and connectivity have been validated successfully for RPC transport* 
 What i tried:
  
From VMs (on Windows) the folder (\\NAME\admin$) opens normally with the data that i specified. I have tried turning this feature (Enable application-aware processing) on and off in the settings, the result is the same. 
  
This error is in the report:
 1) Failed to create VM recovery checkpoint (mode:Crash consistent)
 2) Failed to create VM recovery checkpoint (mode: Hyper-V child partition snapshot)
  
I tried using powershell to enable vss (vmicvss, vmicvmsession) settings on Windows VMs, it had no effect on the result.
 Changed checkpoint type from production to production-only in settings Hyper-V.
 Checkpoints from the hyper-v manager and from the hypervisor's powershell are created fine.
  
if any additional information is needed, please let me know. Thanks to all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Maybe there is an obvious solution to this that I don't see right away. 
 However, at my work location the inbound ISP connection is very close to some windows and a door. These could easily be broken into and if I place my network gear (NAS in particular) close to there, the thieves could just snatch them and be gone in like 3 minutes.
 Unfortunately, there isn't really anyothers placement inside the work location that is suitable for a serverrack, so I'm stuck with the options of
  
Mount metal rods across the windows and doors to prevent break in. This is not optimal because it's ugly as hell and will also trigger curiosity for the criminals who are looking. I would rather that my location seem inconspicuous.
 
Place the valuable gear inside some kind of safe that is also a serverrack. 
 
 Do you know of a product like this? 
 Any other ideas?
 I'm aware that if someone really wants to steal my gear, they will probably succeed. I just want to make it difficult enough for thieves to be discouraged or complicated enough to allow some time for security to respond to the alarm.

 i'm looking for a smartphone app for innovaphone IP811 on-premise. smartphones are 90% android, 10% apple, but apple not that important
 Mypbx-app 12r2 sr59 can be used to outgoing calls using company office personal number, and can be used for inconing calls using company office personal number mostly without call-forwarding
 any form of cloud is completely disallowed, my boss will ask if i'm sick if I recommend something cloudy.
 missing features are:
 a) boss seems to miss a list of incoming calls on his smartphone, he does not want to keep his boss waiting. 
 b) group calls do not work reliable, meaning five persons are assigned call group 70, all phones should ring when that number is dialled.
 what are options here?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in OEM pre-sales, so I don't have to deal with this shit directly as a customer, but we do partner with the various American service providers who resell our solutions and wrap managed services around it. 
 I've with providers in the past (as a customer), and I've alsoworked in pre-sales for a provider (Verizon), and from my experience,.. all of them are terrible... I can't avoid working with them, sadly, but if I have partner with one of them, I'd rather it it be the one who is least terrible.
 So, when it comes to AT&T, Verizon, Lumen, Specturm, and all the others, which one sucks the least? 
 My Impressions so far:
  
Verizon is horrdendous unless you're talking wireless-only.
 AT&T managed services are "ok", their systems are shit, their baseline circuit support is bad, but they have a good CSM & sales organization that helps alleviate the pain.
 Lumen - Never worked with them, I've heard a lot of bad shit, especially post-Level 3 merger... no clue where they stand these days. Seems like their managed services are bad but their circuits might be ok?
 Spectrum - Good circuits, no clue about the rest.
  
(Note: What I really care about is their ability to deliver enterprise-grade DIA circuits, as well as managed network & security services. Broadband is important too, but from what I've seen, it's something that varies significantly best on the location... and they're all about the same.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently migrated our last server to Azure. This was our file server which only served as file storage. Devices in the network would connect to the shares via a network drive. Mapped drives are setup with group policy. 
 We are connecting to Azure by a site to site vpn. Onsite are redundant Meraki MX250's and we have a meraki vMX in Azure. We have redundant 1Gb up/down fiber connections.
 File server VM specs: D2ds_v5 = 2cpu, 8GB RAM. Standard SSD's
 If I open a network drive on my computer and copy 30MB of files in one folder and paste them to another folder in the same network drive, transfer takes around 3+min. If I remote into the file server VM and do the same file copy and transfer locally it takes 2 seconds. I assumed file transfers would be a little slower since it is no longer onsite but this is much slower than it should be. It almost feels like Azure is throttling the read/writes or throughput. Anyone have any experience with this?

 "Hello Business manager,
 I hope you're having a good day. I recently switched banks and require your assistance in updating my new account information for direct deposits. Please specify what information should be included for upcoming payments.

 The business manager knew this was fake, because the person was at work 2 feet away from her on Jan 24th.
 The very next morning on Jan 25th Employee #2 comes to me (jr admin here) saying that employee #1 was logged into Employee #2's computer...this is highly unlikely (employee #1 does not work on this floor and she barely knows how to log into her OWN computer) and would be considered out of line in this job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All! 
 I’ve got 2x DL360 Gen10 2019 “standard”servers. Both setup as RAID 10. Server1 is setup as a Hyper-V server hosting 4 vms (2016 servers) and roughly 15 TBs of data including an sql server that is the bulk of the data. 
 Server2 is identical to Server1; processor, ram, partitions,etc. This is a fresh server, only Hyper V installed. I have not moved/copied over any vms or data data, just installed a the same roles and applied some updates. Figured over a weekend I’d save off the VMs and import them into server2 and robocopy daily to sync data. Would this work? 
 My mission is to figure out a way to have the “in production” server1 in building A sync or mirror to server2 in building B (fiber). In the event of a disaster I’d be able to move server2 into production and keep folks working. Servers are on the same domain, network, vlan and can see one another. 
 Is it possible to set server1 up to regularly sync everything including vms and their data to server2 in real-time or hourly/bi-hourly intervals using robocopy? I’m okay with daily, but hourly would be better. MS best practices? Not opposed to 3rd party software, but would prefer a free Microsoft option if available (limited resources). 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! 
 Tldr, sync 2 identical 2019 standard servers with 4 hyper vms for disaster recovery using robocopy to sync data regularly.

 The guys want to get better at documenting their work and we obviously need to get away from having all that info out of our lead tech's noggin. Most of our documentation is printed on paper and shoved into a file cabinet with the service info. 
 We'd like to be able to create circuit IDs for all of our paths and document all relevant info for connectors, patch panels, splices, buffer tubes, breakouts, splits, as well as important things like splice reports, OTDR reports, locate notes etc. 
 Could we use a tool like OpenDCIM for this, or is there something else we can deploy to get us started? If you've got any tips or advice to get me started I'd appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a confusing issue. I have a Win Server 2019 acting as a domain controller (PDC). From this server I am able to successfully ping all clients on the subnet, but I'm not able to ping the 1st hop Mikrotik Switch (crs326-24g-2s+rm). All other clients (including the server 2019 backup domain controller) can ping the Mikrotik.
 A tracert to the switch from the PDC server shows no connectivity, however the server is reachable from other clients connected to the switch.
 Tracing route to mt [192.168.x.y]
 over a maximum of 30 hops:
 1 * * * Request timed out.
 2 * * * Request timed out.
 3 * * * Request timed out.
 Thus far I have:
  
Rebooted the Mikrotik
 Rebooted the server in question (PDC)
 Changed ethernet cables
 Changed port the PDC is connected to on the Mikrotik to a port that another server 2019 instance was able to successfully ping from
 Tested ping from all other clients on the subnet
 Verified server IP is part of the same subnet as the switch IP.
 Disabled the windows firewall - had no impact
  
The PDC is directly connected to the switch. I'm able to ping the gateway on the other side of the switch, and am able to ping all clients connected to the switch.
 Network topology is quite simple. All clients connected to the Mikrotik, and a single router upstream connected to the modem.
 Any thoughts on how to re-establish pings from this server? I have a monitoring app that reports uptime from this server (I know...I know...shouldn't be on a PDC), and right now it is reporting the switch is down. This started yesterday. Previous to that there were no issues. No changes to the PDC have been made, which makes this even more confusing.
 Thanks everyone,
 Cal.

 I just finished a meeting with my manager where we reviewed the questionnaire from our cyber insurance provider. He seems willing to spend time and money on the security controls that we're currently missing. I've brought up every one of these in the past, but where before he would say "Too expensive," now his comments are, "That seems reasonable," and "Our contracts require us to carry cyber insurance, so we should implement this."
 I am going to be busy, but I am so happy.
 Did any else suddenly get full go-ahead to implement security controls after their cyber insurance provider made it the obvious choice?

 I just installed a pair of 9800-L-F in HA mode (RMI+RP). RP ports are connected back to back and TE0/1/0 from each WLC are connected to the core switch.
 When I disconnect the f.o. port from the active controller the other one takes control, and that's fine. The former active controller, however, have to reboot itself before completing the active to standby transistion (don't know why it needs to reboot but that's the way Cisco decided...): if I reconnect the fiber cable BEFORE the unit is rebooted, it will completely freeze. No output whatsoever on the console and the box is completely dead until I disconnect and reconnect the power cable.
 Has anyone seen this behaviour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I am getting tired of coming across unauthorised and unsecure devices on our network. I know NAC is the solution but our company is impotent and unable to sort out the management policy side of things to actually implement it. In the meantime I am scanning our network with various tools I have and kicking off devices that break the current policies I am allowed to enforce. Have been using Zenmap on Mac but was wondering if there was a better version or option out there that is free/open source? Perhaps something that can be installed on a server and present scans or reports in a nicer way? We have some other tools that can fingerprint but they mostly rely on DHCP relay to get info so are only useful for DHCP devices and don't see stuff on static IPs. Any suggestions of tools welcome. I appreciate this isn't cyber security sub but I am a network engineer and looking at ultimately discovering as many of these devices as possible to boot them off until management pulls their fingers out and allows us to implement NAC. Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for API support on a C9500-16X running IOS-XE 17.6.3, but I have also seen the same issue on v16.6 code and 17.6.4.
 If you have a trunk interface with enough VLAN allowed entries that the cli displays the list as multiple lines with the “add” option e.g.:
  
interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport trunk native vlan 99
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,4,8,10,30,40,50
 switchport trunk allowed vlan add 202,241,342,400,1101
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport nonegotiate
 end 
  
When I use RESTCONF to interrogate the config with a URL like:https://<ip>/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native/interface/TenGigabitEthernet 
 The results only list the final 'add' line - and lose the 'switchport trunk allowed vlan' line:
  // "switchport": { "Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:mode": { "trunk": {} }, "Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:nonegotiate": [null], "Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:trunk": { "allowed": { "vlan": { "add": "202,241,342,400,1101" } }, "native": { "vlan": { "vlan-id": 99 } } } } 
 It appears it doesn't see the information regarding the config line:
  
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,4,8,10,30,40,50
  
Am I doing something wrong? Is there another way to get this information or is this a bug?

 ​
 We need to find an analytics solution to monitor our campus network. It is a large campus with 20k+ devices being used at a time. We have Extreme Cloud IQ currently and we are using the wireless and NAC portions of the software. It makes sense to use the Extreme option since we already have other products, but if there is a better solution, I would like to know. I would also like to ask if this would allow us more insight into upstream routing information, as we somewhat regularly have routing issues between our two ISPs (I can add more detail if needed). Incase our basic setup is helpful in forming your answer, our core is Extreme Networks and our firewall is Palo Alto and we have a full 10gb network down to the switches. Our end-user numbers are ~18k and each has ~3 devices.

 So just a heads up to others planning on canceling: You have to fill out their Contact Form on https://support.lastpass.com/contactm and they will then call you (and try to convince you, not to cancel).
 To their credit, I got a call within 15 minutes.
 I hope I have saved others the time i wasted, trying to cancel on their Website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey.
 I have been looking at an issue again lately.
 The problem is that flow cache data in IOS XR does not contain src/dst AS, prefix lengths, etc.
 (I.e. all bgp attribute-download attributes)
 This is running netflow on an interface in vrf with mpls label allocation mode "per-ce".
 As per documentation:
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k-r6-2/netflow/configuration/guide/b-netflow-cg-asr9000-62x/b-netflow-cg-asr9000-62x_chapter_010.html
 ​
  
When the netflow configuration for VPNv4 or VPNv6 is applied in label allocation mode (either per prefix or per CE) then the IPv4 or IPv6 netflow do not capture the BGP attributes such as BGP nh, BGP AS numbers and prefix lengths; these attributes values are set to zero.
  
What is your take on this? I figure there must be someone else with the same architecture requirement who are facing the same limitation, who might have solved or worked around it in a way or another?
 If so, let me know what you did

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network guy here. I'm experimenting in a lab environment to test the feasibility of a DR strategy and a "make it or break it" caveat that I ran into is that I can't seem to find a way to tell windows to source requests that it initiates FROM the loopback adapter IP.
 Sure, it can listen on the loopback, and take in requests from it... but when I initiate a request FROM the server, it uses the NIC's IP address, which makes sense.. however I want to configure it to source all of these requests from the loopback adapter if possible, routing through the NIC.
 ​
 Example:
 NIC: 10.0.0.100/24 
 Loopback: 172.18.1.100/32
 If I am RDP'd into the server and go to https://www.google.com/, then run a "netstat -an | findstr 443", I will see this:
 10.0.0.100:52143 142.251.40.196:443 ESTABLISHED
 Where I'd like for it to look like this:
 172.18.1.100:52143 142.251.40.196:443 ESTABLISHED
 ​
 Does anyone know if this is possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Fellow Nerds, 
 I'm in search of a rough or direct equivalent to the watchdog daemon on Linux systems. 
 One Windows-based server I manage has an app that needs to run 24/7 basically, and it will typically lock up after a week or so, requiring us to remote into said server to restart the app. Not too big of a deal, takes a few mins. 
 I'm attempting to automate some such tasks in our org and I'm familiar with watchdog on Linux systems and was wondering if anyone knew of an equivalent service for Windows-based server platforms. Something that would simply ping the app or service every X minutes/hours and kill/relaunch the app if it doesn't respond, or if it's hung, etc. 
 My Google-fu is normally incredibly strong, but I'm not finding much for this one. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for your time gents and ladies.

Since the drastic bulk of my spam comes from Google's servers, either from Gmail or the Google SMTP or Google API send, if someone has found a way to hard bounce Google successfully, please feel free to share, thanks.
 My logs are filled with the following; Google is clearly resending on a schedule where it tries to deliver the hard bounced email for 3 days at increasing intervals - so I end up getting maybe 20 of these exact same Google retries - until it gives up whereas it should be giving up the moment it receives the 550:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, just a quick ramble and I am curious how others see this scenario since it is a very common one. We have about 1000 users in our environment, everyone works from home 3 days per week. The users connect to a VPN from home, just like almost every other company.
 We've had MFA rolled out for a long time with SMS authentication, but recently one of the C-suites was targeted in a SIM swap. We're now switching over to an authenticator-based solution which requires users to have an authenticator app on their phones. It has been going well, but we have a small handful of users (about 10) who are adamantly against using their phones for anything work-related. These users all have smartphones, so there is no technical limitation stopping them from being able to install the authenticator app.
 My ideology is that phones, like internet at home, or like transportation to and from work, are all things that an employee are expected to have. Everyone already understands that they can connect to their own home Wifi to then access our VPN and connect to our corporate network, and that is taking some bandwidth from their other devices. I'm not really seeing the difference between those two use cases as we aren't monitoring their phones, or adding any MDM solution to them. They could feel that way but I'd expect them to already feel that way by connecting a corporate laptop to their home network.
 I know most companies provide cell phones or stipends to employees for phone services if they are expected to use their phones for work purposes but no employee is expected to do anything besides receive a 6-digit code to authenticate when logging in to our systems.
 Management requested us to just set up a group for users who refuse to just leave their policy to only require SMS authentication.

 I am aware of the option to use one router as a CA server, I took that into consideration, but I wonder if I can create a CA on an ubuntu image so all the IPsec peers get their certificate from that server. Does anybody know any solution? Is it even worth it? Or should I just stick to the router option?
 What solution is used in a real-life scenario? I saw some equipment online like Fortinet FortiAuthentifier or something like that.
 Thank you very much! Have a productive week.

 I am wondering what is called user when buying CAL licenses. I couldn't find answers which are not ambiguous.
 Is it a physical user ? Or an active directory user ?
 For example, we have 5 physical users, they all have their own computer with their own users but there is a 6th computer being a 6th user in active directory but only the 5 same physical users have a use on it. 
 Do we need 5 or 6 in that case ?
 Thanks !

I'm a bit puzzled by the fact that even though they have a REST API (and also a Powershell API), there's almost nothing out there to be found when it comes to scripts, python modules, Ansible modules, etc. I know there is their Kemp360 product but that one seems fairly limited in regards to what you can do with it.
 So for those of you that have larger deployments (i.e. more than one cluster...), how do you manage them? Custom scripts? Point and click in web interface? Anything else?

 My outgoing IP appears on 24 blacklists including 0spam, Ascams, SORBS, Backscatterer, etc.
 The TXT descriptions of some of these lists show clearly that my IP is on there because other users of my IP have misbehaved. There are subject lines of emails in the last two weeks like "Manpower from Pakistan", "Our Loan Products", etc., as well as send dates (anywhere between 2013 and 2023) which have absolutely nothing to do with me.
 I have DMARC, DKIM and SPF all correctly set up.
 Yet, my emails sometimes does not get through to certain recipients so I'm sure there are deliverability issues.
 Is it normal that a PAID email provider like Google Workspace will be sending your emails through a dirty IP?
 Another thread suggests setting up an outgoing proxy Amazon SES IP. I'm technical enough to do this, but is it worth it? How do I know that it won't be polluted as well?
 Any other solutions appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we now have SentinelOne. Its supposed to be good but its behaviour engine is becoming increasingly annoying.
 Lets take Process Explorer as an example. Its a well know Microsoft app, yet Sentinel doesn't like its PROCEXP152.SYS file. Its a "SignedKnownAndVerified", it knows it came from procexp64.exe, I have put an exclusion in
 c:\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 Yet it ignores this and flags it as malicious every time.
 It claims the file is loading here:
 \Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 So we put in 
 \Device\HarddiskVolume*\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 A star wildcard. But makes no difference. Flagging it in the console as a false positive appears to do nothing to stop it flagging it again.
 Anyone else had issues with SentinelOne's behaviour engine?

 The role is for an IT officer, so not quite sysadmin, but it's basically a frontline role, troubleshooting peoples issues, helping with their workflows and teaching groups how to use relevant software. 
 A bit of background on me. I have no formal IT qualifications, but I love technology and I have spent a lot of my career helping people out with their tech and workflows, having had friends in the IT department at a previous job who taught me a lot. I spend a lot of my personal time learning things. I've learned HTML, CSS and Javascript, Adobe Cloud and I'm good with office and Excel and I can easily pick up new software. I know that I'm more than capable of the role. 
 I would really like to get this job, given a complicated personal life with my wife's health, the role is ideal for a good work life balance. Can anyone give me any insight into what they will be looking for and how I can best impress. 
 Appreciate any and all help. 
 Thanks.

 now i dont know how this sysadmin knows that hell is about to break loose because 5 minutes to having some tampers flare or managers being involved about the delay, he will quickly create the accounts or do the required system changes then dumps the information to me, and as soon as an alarm is raised he will divert all the anger towards me saying he is working on your issue or he has the details you need or he is the one supposed to do xyz -which would be technically true but i couldnt have done it for the past 10 days because i was waiting for the sysadmin to make system changes
 now im looking like im stupid, slow or without a sense of urgence yet he was the one sitting on the tickets for a whole week, and i now have a tonne load of things to do in small amount of time on top of what i already have to do

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New day, new rant.
 Starting yesterday, we officially stopped supporting any HP printer (except high end enterprise printers). A few months back it was only the printers with an "e" in the model name. Now it's everyone of them.
 Why?
 Because installing a printer used to be very simple:
  
do a dhcp reservation
 connect the printer
 install drivers
 (optionally) deploy it with policies
 ​
 (solve the tons of problems any printer had since the 90's)
  
​
 for years, it took 10 minutes to unpack and mount and 10 minutes of software/drivers installation etc....
 ​
 Now, unpack the printer still takes 20 minutes (top).
 Working with small offices and small (20-400 people) companies that actually use low-to-mid-range printers, installing them on clients has now become a nightmare.
 You have to use that f***ing "HP SMART" application, downloaded from windows store. It's impossible to do that on servers, you have to use a customer's pc. And don't even try to connect a USB cable before completing the in-app procedure!
 Then half of those printers... they just doesn't work.
 A few of them doesn't connect to their "HP Web Services", the majority are stuck with a "complete the configuration..." message. Resetting, reinstalling application, jumping on a single foot, running a marathon, get a new cable, cutting the cable, using it as a whip...
 Nothing works. Returning and replacing it with any other brand is just easier and way faster.

 I've also posted this on homenetworking, but hoping I could also get some input here
 Hoping I could get some advise here. I've recently bought a house that is yet to be build. The expected delivery date of the house is Q2 of 2024.
 The house is a project build and during the build we have option. One of the option is the placement of ethernet connection. You might be thinking, why not do this yourself? Well unlike traditional house building where there is an "empty pipe" in the wall to pull your own cable. This construction will not have this. The cables will directly be pulled in the wall during the build of the house. I'm not allowed to do anything while the house is being build until I get my keys. By then hopefully all the walls are in place.
 Here is where I need you…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey yall, I have been tasked with building suitable a network that mimics the ones used in urban areas. 
 What do I mean?
 So in my country they are using networks made specifically for densely populated areas for remote areas causing speed and performance drop in connection in rural areas. It involved redundant transmission routes. However, it focused on high commercial areas or the major residential areas of certain parishes. Where the return on investment was almost guaranteed, low geographic challenges and high value customers.
 Is there a topology/strategy I could implement that could work on a community level that would see a consistent network performance similar to urban areas that would be cost effective/not expensive to implement by a developing country that will positively affect low income/non-high value customers? 
 Also what simulation software I can use to test this infrastructure and how it performs to a different situations like high device count so we can narrow down a best possible infrastructure for a remote community?

 Is it a no-no to update it to "Systems Engineer", at least for the duration of the application process for this new role?

 The idea of having a self-hosted system that, if for some reason had to be taken down, could fall-back to a cloud-version sounds amazing.
 Some obvious caveats would include synchronizing critical file systems and services, but I'm curious if this has been done before.
  
What made me think of this in the first place is that I'm hosting my own mail server at home, but the thought of missing mail due to a hardware issue that could last a few days worries me. Would love to host myself, but fall back to something solid during harsh times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've noticed that with my company firewall, there are some web pages that are being blocked. 
 Most specifically login pages owned and operated by small companies. 
 Major Contendors like microsoft or adobe are not an issue, but smaller budget companies it's hit an miss on whether or not my firewall will let a login page load. 
 I've tried going into my firewall log files to trace the blocks and white list the Domains/ip's but even with those domains marked as enabled the loading screens fail to load. 
 However they work perfectly fine when I bypass my network and hotspot on my phone. 
 I'm running on the assumption that there's some secondary domain required for my whitelist before I can load the login pages correctly. 
 So the question is, can I record it? can I run some kind of tool on a web page while it's hotspotting on my phone to create a log of that all the web browser is trying to call so I can make sure the correct items are white listed in my firewall? 
 How would you go about resolving this?

 I'm the IT Manager for a local county. Our domain is appomattoxcountyva.gov We use Rackspace as our email provider. We are still receiving emails, but today at about 10AM our emails stopped sending, throwing this error:
  
host
 relay-webapps.rsapps.net[172.27.255.140] said: 550 5.7.26 550-5.7.26 This
 message does not pass authentication checks. Destination server has blocked
 your message. Please fix your domain DNS configuration, Thanks!.
 (ZD/67D1379) (in reply to end of DATA command) 
  
We haven't needed to touch our DNS configuration in about 5 years. 
 Nonetheless, I logged on to zoneedit.com to adjust our settings.
 I used MX Toolbox and it shows our SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records all to be in the green.
 Still, no emails are sending from our domain.
 ​
 Admittedly I know very little about these records, because like I said we've never had to adjust them. 
 Am I doing something wrong? I would be happy to share any additional information as needed.
 ​
 If you can help at all, I sincerely thank you in advance.

 One of our helpdesk guys was getting this laptop ready to use as a loaner. Unfortunately I've broken our MDT server temporarily so they decided to image it with our Windows 10 installer from VLSC. They imaged it, connected it to our network, and now we have a screen that think's it's needing to be joined to another company.
 https://i.imgur.com/cZ0WYYz.jpg
 I'm just curious if anyone knows of a proper way to get this taken care of. We're not attached to it. It's out of warranty, but we would prefer to give it some more life at least as a loaner or through our recycling company that repurposes some computers for local non-profits.
 We bought this laptop direct from Dell too, not a 2nd hand one.
 EDIT: Thanks for the recommendations. Have a ticket in with MS. Just waiting for someone to get back to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is also an issue with our 3560 switches.
 Copper switch with a 4 port sfp module. These ports can do either gig or 10 gig speeds. We have 1 10 gig sfp in each switch and we are using that as our uplink.
 Why is it that when I do a show run on the switch, I see both gi1/1/1-4 and te1/1/1-4, as if there are 8 total ports, when really there are only 4? Is there a way to configure it to only show the 10 gig ports?
 And the reason I am asking is because it is not consistant on all of the switches. We are using 10 gig on all the switches, but some show the 1 gig ports in the running config and some dont. And this is causing some issues for some scripts I am trying to run. So just curious if there is a command I can run to get rid of the 1 gig ports from the running config. When I do a "show interface status", I do not see the 1 gig ports, only the 10 gig ports.

Does the AP need to support any 802.1x features or does it solely just pass the traffic back to the WLC to proxy to ISE? Could the AP impact the authentication or does it have anything to do with radius in this topology. 
 ​
 ISE = Authentication Server
 WLC = Authenticator (Proxy to ISE)
 Desk phone = Supplicant
 ​
 Another question was were could reauthentication originate from in this. I believe it could either be set in ISE under authorization policies or on the WLC in the global config or per WLAN. Co worker seems to think the AP could also impact reauth.

 https://www.amazon.com/Access-Control-Supply-Converter-110V-240V/dp/B01MXY4FDN/
 and https://beseencontrol.com/
 The IT department only heard about it after they'd tried installing the software and connecting the controller to the network.
 The software is sketchy as hell. The business is based in China, there's no EULA or licensing, every reference to the software calls it something different and they're all super generic names.
 For all the red flags, I can't point to anything that proves it's dangerous. I really don't want to be the bad guy shutting down a project because I have a bad feeling. OTOH I am the company's security officer and I'll be responsible if/when this thing compromises our network or leaks sensitive information. 
 How do you handle this kind of thing without building a bad reputation?

I believe AI will eliminate those jobs but sysadmin jobs will be needed to be staffed by people. Also, higher level calls on server issues and PCs will also need onsite sysadmins. That's not even including server appliances, iot, WiFi, cyber security, and many others. 
 Companies have slowed cloud growth. Eventually we will see growth end and find that a lot of companies will continue with on-prem and private cloud servers over the massive outages from AWS and Azure. That will require hands on.

But somehow they expect me to work everyday including weekends. She went as far as kept texting late at night. So this morning she escalated to my manager as if I'm not doing my job. I understand this during business hours but it's as if they expect me to work over the weekend for something that's not an emergency and not responding to it results in an escalation and just making me look bad with management and not only that but it becomes retaliatory in the sense that they make a big effort to make me look bad and at the same time demand higher urgency in retaliation, like trying to make my life harder because I dared to not respond over the weekend.
 This is very usual at my company and the sad part is that company management sides with these bullies, because they're heralded as heroes of the company that keep moving it.
 Sorry for the rant, I just feel sometimes they feel we're not human.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, got a bit of a strange situation I stumbled upon. For reference this post deals with two separate sites that are unable to communicate with one another (or correctly at least). For simplicity I'm going to refer to them as Site A and Site B and the majority of the IT team including myself works at a different branch from the two.
 I first became aware of the issue when a member of the helpdesk team brought up that Site A can't communicate with Site B. Surface level this appeared to be true as he had run ping tests from the DC at Site A to the gateway at Site B receiving "Request timed out." response. However, Site B can ping Site A without issue... I assumed that this is some sort of blocking issue with one of the FortiGate's since one of the sites can send ICMP echo packets it wouldn't be a routing issue. But I see nothing related to the ping tests shown in the logs on Site A or Site B's FortiGate. I would run a pcap but the deployed models do not have onboard memory unfortunately.
 Then it started to get a bit confusing, I ran a trace route from a VM at Site A to Site B and it completed without issue. The sequence of hops was as follows: Site A VM -> Site A Layer 3 Switch -> Site A FortiGate -> Site B FortiGate -> Site B Layer 3 Switch -> destination IP.
 Out of curiosity I ran a perpetual ping test from Site A to Site B for 10~ minutes and shockingly saw a couple successful ping attempts among all the "Request timed out." responses (98% loss for reference). Site A is also able to communicate with all of our other sites without issue.
 Any advice or tips for this? This one is starting to make my head spin and I feel I may be missing something obvious.
 Edit: Forgot to mention - Site B responds to ping from all of our other sites without issue.

 ​
 Numerous times I've been given *link_to_wiki_article* around some of the systems I'm dealing with, how to access them, etc. only for the documentation to not cover it in the slightest, or to be so vague as to send you on a wild goose chase through nested folders of documents.
 ​
 There's nothing more frustrating than having people confidently tell you "follow the documentation explicitly, it covers everything you need!", only to immediately hit something not covered by the documentation and falling at the first hurdle.
 Adding to the frustration are quirks and such that I had specifically asked about because I suspected they may become an issue, only to be told "oh no, just do this" as per the documentation.
 *thing doesn't work*
 "Oh, that's not working because ____" (_____ insert thing I fucking asked about previously)
 ​
 Make sure you document the shit you assemble, folks.
 Especially if you're handing it over to someone and confidently pointing them to your incorrect or missing documentation.
 ​
 So far I'm counting about a week of wasted work from being led back and forth by different people that can't agree on the correct process, and it's really rubbing me the wrong way to hear "that's because of ___" as if I should just know already!
 If it's a known step, add it to the fucking documentation, you cretins!

There are a couple of ventilation shafts that I could run cables through, but they’re not along a corridor so I would have to punch holes through a tenant’s unit to grab the lines into corridors.
 But the elevator shaft is right there and would be so much easier. I have the tool to open the door and stop the elevator. If I run it through conduit it wouldn’t interfere with the elevator.
 Is that stupid dangerous? Have any professionals here run lines up a shaft? Is this a huge code violation??? Will I be featured in Darwin Awards??

 But what do you think? Is this true or BS? 
 The only thing I can imagine is that, if you are going for the application centric approach, so using whitelisting and contracts etc., that you don't need firewalls between each segment for east west traffic, obviously, perimeter firewalls are still needed.
 Correct?
 Also, if your ACI is based on a network centric approach, so no Contracts (expect a Contract to allow all) etc. then you would need 100% firewalls, like on any traditional network, right?

 So imagine you have a collapsed core design with 2 Core switches and 4 Access switches. (might add another AS in future)
 So I'd just connect every AS to each CS (so redundant uplink), run VRRP and L3 on the CS's, no need for STP (!WIN!).
 What benefits does stacking have in this setup? (Data stacking)
 -Do you not connect each AS to the CS in a stack?
 -you have a single SSH session to control the whole stack, fair.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time lurker, first time poster on this account, thanks for all the information shared. We have a corporate partner (CP) that manages an existing tenant. Meanwhile, we are our own standalone org and aren't required to use the CP's services. Being on enterprise M365 licenses, we've been able to use the Power Platform (Power Automate, Apps, BI, etc) with great success but we keep running hitting ceilings on what we can do without admin access.
 Some of those things would be account creation automation based on roles, dynamic group memberships, Azure AD (we have traditional on prem DC), SharePoint customization, use of Intune, etc. All that is cool, but when the C-Suite learned the CP can technically access all of our email, OneDrive, etc, they became very committed rolling our own tenant. 
 So here we are! We've been reading up on implementing a non-routable domain into a hybrid Azure AD setup, email management, MFA setup, what the a transition looks like for our end users, etc but we all know academic knowledge vs implementation experience are two very different things. Fwiw, our CP is supportive of the transition so bad blood and politics shouldn't be a factor here.
 What are your thoughts on best practices, things you would be looking out for, general advice given this scenario? 
 TL;DR We're moving away from a tenant managed by a 'provider' to our own in-house management, asking best practices, advice for setup, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I'm trying to figure out the average cost of having Dell replace a disk or a raid controller battery on an out-of-warranty storage array. Country is France.
 The only information I've managed to find is that in case of need, I'll have to pay a 450€ diagnosis fee before I can even get an invoice for the actual intervention.
 The bosses want to stop paying for the warranty extensions and are asking what's the financial risk in case something happens.
 Thanks in advance for any info on that !
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never expect much from Microsoft Support, it usually takes plenty of back and forth before you can ever make progress if it ever does happen. But my last experience with them left me dumbfounded.
 I raised a ticket for an issue that inadvertently affected all of our mobile users, and upon their first email to me I was told it would be escalated to their intune team. I recieved one email from intune support asking to provide relevant information, then radio silence for the next 3 weeks. I sent maybe 4 followups asking when I would get a response, but to no avail.
 Fast forward to today, I finally get an email from them saying they have been trying to reach out to me but I must be busy so they will archive the ticket. Scrolling through the email thread, yes they have been "trying to reach out", but all of their emails after the initial one to gather more info were sent to my email address except with the domain slightly misspelled. The thread is full of NDR's.
 I find it hard to believe that someone employed as an intune specialist would not realize that receiving NDR's that my email address does not exist would not realize that I'm not receiving the emails. And what a coincidence that they finally got my email address correct when sending the case closure email. I guess their reply button must have been broken and causing my domain to be misspelled on all the emails where they try to offer assistance.
 Anyways I'm just here to rant, after several days and hundreds of re-enrollments we have gotten things under control. My already rock bottom expectations from Microsift support have reached a new low.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work from home about 2/3rds of the time and spend the other 1/3rd in the office. When working from home I always RDP into my office workstation and for the most part I've had no issues. I have a 3 monitor setup at both work and home. The office workstation is almost 10 years old, and I'm attempting to upgrade to a newer box which is much better equipped but RDP access to the box is much slower, lags, and the most annoying thing is that upon connection the screen flashes black for a couple of minutes (but not every time) before finally settling down. Performance when physically at the box is good, definitely better than the 10yr old box. Both are in the same OU, Have the same Windows 10 Enterprise image, and have the same Group Policy applied. I've disabled the RDP hardware graphics acceleration which my research shows to be a cause of the flashing screen upon connection. I use RDP in the course of my daily routine on various devices and have never encountered an issue like this, RDP is generally something that just works and most of the time I can't even tell that I'm connected to a remote box. It doesn't appear to be a client side issue or a multi monitor issue, performance is consistent if I'm connected across the VPN or locally from any device and no errors are indicated in the event log. 
 For a number of functional and psychological reasons I need a physical box that I use both when at home and at the office. Do you have any recommendations on how to improve RDP performance on this new box? 
 Here are the specs:
 New:
 HPZ2 G9 i7-12700, 32GB ram, Nvidia RTX A2000
 Old:
 i7-3930K, 32GB ram, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660

 I have had a look at recent posts regarding this, but most are a few years old.
 In trying to find a replacement for our current IT Helpdesk solution, I have noticed that Microsoft have a pre-cooked IT Helpdesk template available for people to setup as a Teams SharePoint site:
 Template info can be found here.
 My questions are:
 Anyone out there currently using this? 
 How are you getting on with it?
 How comparable is it to other helpdesk solutions you have used? 
 How does the Microsoft Lists integration work with regards to logging, managing, and interacting with users? 
 Are email notifications a thing when tickets are updated/assigned?
 Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for insight!

 My set-up is a work laptop connecting via single USB-C to a Dell monitor, daisy-chained via DP to another Dell monitor. Primary Dell monitor has built-in usb-c hub with peripherals such as webcam, mouse, keyboard etc connecting to this.
 Failures - 
 1) U2419HC lasted about 18 months then usb hub stopped working. Video was fine. Tried swapping cables, using different laptop, no joy. 
 2) Dell replaced first monitor for U2422HE. This worked fine for 2 months then again usb hub died
 3) Dell replaced again, for U2421E. This has lasted just over 3 weeks, and again usb hub has died. Literally working for few hours in the morning, now no peripheral is detected. Multiple power cycles of laptops, monitors and unplug then re-plug usb devices to no avail.
 ​
 Are usb-c monitors known to have very cheap/flaky hubs ? 
 Could something I am doing be responsible for breaking the hub somehow ? I can't see how as my usb devices are nothing unusual - logitech mx keys wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, logitech webcam, Majority RS1 microphone.
 Any suggestions welcome...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a team of 12-16 Architects working locally in an office, with other team members in different countries and many users working from home from time to time.
 Several years ago, we installed and implemented Egnyte to combine local and cloud storage with a simple NAS. Since then we have migrated to their hybrid drive solution with an expensive ,windows server running the server software and a windows plugin on each computer serving files from the cloud or the server, depending on location. The search path for all files remain the same. A great server solution with hardware costs remainso nothing. Useful and straightforward, in theory.
 In reality: The service is expensive since we have a lot of server data (around 10TB) and the hybrid software makes the work in our CAD software very slow since each work session loads hundreds of files and the hybrid software/server solution becomes incredibly slow. In reality, we need to sync all folders locally even when we are on our LAN with a server.
 As an administrator without any professional knowledge of IT systems, it is near impossible for me to find other alternatives and compare the pricing and functionality. We will need to get out of this as soon as possible.
 Which Egnyte alternative should we look into? 
 (Sorry for the low-quality question.)

 I don't want to use Azure AD or a third party service (yes, I am aware it's probably smarter or safer). I have a huge handful of applications and services, both on and off site that require login (obviously) and we have the option of LDAP authentication. 
 Is it safe, smart, or even possible to have an LDAP server that faces the internet to help authenticate users?

 Also, this is for my home network, just i wanted to be more professional to setup a domain for 3 computers. Is this subreddit right?
 The story:
 Years ago, i setup a Debian vm to act as a domain controller in my home network, two W10 PCs and 1 W11 PC.
 Because Samba 4.9.5 (the latest for Debian 10) doesn't play nice with windows 11 22H2, I tried to install samba 4.17 from Debian-backports but i'm a linux n00b and I accidentally wiped the VM.
 "LOL, let's try again, let's restore the latest VM backup" - I told to myself.
 the problem is that the latest VM backup is one year old and doesn't have the W11 PC on it. If i rejoin the domain, will I lose the account on the W11 PC?

We have an in place archive with a retention policy that archives mail older than 3 months and it is increasing in size so we know it is working, but the rate of inbound mail seems to be greater than the mail that is being archived as the inbox size isn't decreasing.
 ​
 To help resolve this we've created a new inbox (which I will refer to as the Customer Service History inbox from here onwards) and we've asked our MSP extract all email sent/received before 01/01/2021 as a PST file to upload into the customer service history inbox - then they will delete all mail sent/received prior to 01/01/2021 from the live customer service inbox.
 ​
 Due to the size of the PST file our MSP is struggling to do this.
 ​
 We had hoped initially that we would be able to use the SearchMailbox PowerShell cmdlets to copy mail across inboxes rather than having to do a PST export/import but these cmdlets have been retired in Exchange Online and I couldn't find a suitable replacement PowerShell command that works.
 ​
 The industry I work in requires us to retain customer emails so we can't just delete all the old mail.
 ​
 Does anyone with more experience in this area have suggestions about what we could try?
 ​
 The ideal outcome is that:
  
The customer service team can still access old emails for complaints/compliance/legal cases
 The main customer service inbox stays well below 98% capacity (for at least another year)
  
​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Only locally saved files seem to have this issue. When opening Office files from a working network drive there's no problem. It seems like Office wants to check all present network drives before opening the file causing it to hang on the loading popup. If I net use /delete the drive, the problem is fixed instantly. 
 Has anyone seen this issue? I have been looking for a fix to disable this 'drive check' when opening apps or their files. 
 Yes, network drives are old-fashioned and I want to get rid of them too but it's a slow process as they're ingrained in lots of stuff at this company.

 Let's take AWS as an example.
 The question is: does AWS different data centers, distributed across a wide geographic area, show a considerably more stable connection, from latency point of view (RTT), than the connection of say a random client and server, connected across the same geographic area?
 For instance, if we measured the RTT between two data centers of AWS, one in Australia, and the other on the West Coast US, does that connection any more stable than say one client in Australia connected to a server in California?
 Or do these data centers have no unique connection between them whatsoever?

 I started managing a software deployment system and the current image is deploying multiple dotNet packages to a Windows 10 x64 image. How does dotNet Framework versions work, are they backwards compatible?
 We are deploying 3.5 SP1, then 4.5.1, then the patching automatically updates those.
 Would it be enough to simply deploy the latest dotNet Framework version and it would be backwards compatible?
 Or is this a bit like Java, where applications programmed for it expect a certain version and it has to be exactly that one, so you might end up with multiple dotNet Framework installations?
 Many thanks!

 we have a client that wants to refresh the WLAN infrastructure (Interasys) and bought two 9800-L appliances with X many APs. The appliances are directly connected to the ICX core switches with 4x fiber uplinks.
 On the WLC side the configuration is straightforward and consists of:
 - MGMT+RMIs in VLAN 1 (MGMT). Yes I know, it is recommended not to use VLAN 1 but that's the reality and the client can't change this right away and maybe does not want to.
 - 5 VLANs for SSIDs.
 - One VLAN (VLAN 10) for access points as per request from the client. The existing WLAN infrastructure is an old Interasys System with the APs on a separate VLAN and separate physical link to the core. We tested first with VLAN 1.
 - The uplinks are configured as trunk of course and on the native VLAN side …]]></summary>

 I need advice/solutions that can work with the ballsache that I have at the moment.
 We are running Jira 7.5, this uses basic auth to pull tickets for support mailboxes
 MS doesnt do basic auth, but our domain provider does
 So a solution that kinda works was implemented
 Basically, you mail itsupport@stupidasscompany and it gets forwarded to itsupport@seconddomainforsupidasscompany where Jira picks it up and logs a ticket for you
 Problems, Sometimes the end user (external clients) get a bounceback
 Bounceback shows client@stupidasscompany instead of client@clientsrealdomain. If the client mails the same mail, it goes through. Fails are random
 So verification is failing. I have disabled verification on the domain provider's side. But this hasnt fixed the issue
 Oh and our company makes use of 365 
 The bigger bosses dont want to upgrade Jira becuase of legacy costs... We cant move away from it as the company has managed to implement it in too many systems...
 Basically im screwed at the moment and would love some light in this tunnel.
 Please dont judge me too harshly. Im working with what i have

 I am hoping someone has a hint for me. One of our clients has a Dell SAN, which has an "access" LUN that is used for inband management connectivity. The LUN is published to all hosts, and that cannot be changed from the SAN (AFAIK).
 One of our people build two new hypervisors recently, both of which have attached this "access" disk along with the legitimate volumes they need. It appears in disk manager as a 20mb offline disk. Diskpart tells me it is set to be read only.
 The issue I can see is the system log being overrun with constant NTFS errors, all pointing to the GUID of this disk.
 I want to take this disk offline on the hosts, but not sure about any possible ramifications (it seems OK since it looks like some sort of named pipe style channel for use by the dell management utility), and not sure the safest way to remove the volume without affecting the other LUNs on the same iSCSI target.
 Does anyone have any hints or tips for me?
 Thanks for the help.

 i was wondering if someone could shed some light, Currently trying to create a bash script to alert me when a port is opened but not sure if im missing something on the script or if its because it not possible with the website https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
 ​
 #!/bin/bash ip=$1 port=$2 email=$3 # Check if an IP argument is provided if [ -z "$ip" ]; then echo "Please provide an IP address as an argument" exit 1 fi # Check if a port argument is provided if [ -z "$port" ]; then echo "Please provide a port number as an argument" exit 1 fi # Check if an email argument is provided if [ -z "$email" ]; then echo "Please provide an email address as an argument" exit 1 fi # Send a request to yougetsignal.com to check the port response=$(curl -s "http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/?remoteAddress=$ip&portNumber=$port") # Extract the status of the port from the response status=$(echo "$response" | grep -o 'Port [0-9]* is [a-z]*.') # Check if the port is open if [[ $status =~ "open" ]]; then # Send an email alert echo "Port $port is open on IP $ip" | mail -s "Port $port Alert" $email else echo "$status" fi 
 i tried to debug it and found out the response is = to nothing which therefor not going to the second part

 Thank you

 In case you haven't heard, Grafana and Influx are customer of CircleCI who recently announced that another one of their customers had an OAuth token compromised and has put all other CircleCI customers at risk. It has been recommended that all CircleCI customers rotate their secrets.

 I found this in my personal home lab when looking into package update failures for Grafana and Telgraf this weekend, and confirmed it was caused by the invalidated repo keys. You'll need to follow these instructions to fix it.

 We just deployed a new RDS broker running windows server 2022 version 21H2 build 20348.1487, the licensing runs on a separate vm, with two server session hosts. During day one of its use in the main environment to user terminals no one could connect and they would get just blue color(not BSOD) screens or black, pulseway monitoring would be showing the system online and offline repeatedly. we would have to hard shut down the server. The system would come up, users could connect and pulseway reported normal and show the below errors, then the system would run normally for some time but then it would repeat in the same pattern.

 A timeout (90000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the iphlpsvc service.
 then this would come up 
 A timeout (90000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the NlaSvc service.
 ​
 This happens every day since its deployment, and I can not find any rhyme or reason for it, it's the only system doing it, it is not the only windows server 2022 standard in operation. 
 Has anyone come across this issue before? I can't really find anything on this, it is easy to mitigate right now but the force shutdowns are going to take a toll.
 Thank you for any help!

 I grew up doing construction with my dad (kitchen and bath remodeling). I moved on from working with him pretty quickly, but at one point in my 20s I was making $572/week as a "Utility Assistant". This involved varied tasks such as helping the foundation crews break big rocks into smaller rocks, or pulling a softball sized wad of human shit and used tampons out of the building's sewage masticater by hand. For $572 a week.
 Most of my friends are still kind of in that world, or working similar physical labor jobs. Waiting tables, light construction, housekeeper at a hotel, retail, etc. I don't think any of them make over $40k, and they work really hard to get it.
 Last year I made $202k for doing basically fuckall. I sit in a perfectly climate controlled office in a $1500 chair while pushing buttons and staring at screens.
 I don't know. There's no real point to this post. The whole thing just feels kind of gross. 
 I miss my friends, but I'm feeling increasingly disconnected from them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I manage the IT of a small 25 person engineering company and the boss wants everyone being able to work at every desk and even outside of the office in a remote work setting. Because of this the users were already set up with beefy workstation laptops and docking stations at home and every office desk before I started at the company.
 The problem is that the CAD files are stored on a central fileserver in the office and when the users work remotely they work off an SMB connection to the office over VPN which results in extremely slow access speeds and file corruptions.
 I wanted to set them up with individual tower PCs at the office instead or at least a pool of a few PCs in the office and let them connect to those remotely with RDP. Though firstly the boss doesn’t like that option because he wants everyone to be able to work at every desk and secondly the test engineers complain about latency problems regarding their 3D work in programs like Revit and AutoCAD. For example they say rotating the view is too cumbersome over the remote connection. I’m currently testing parsec instead of RDP but that has similar problems and is quite buggy.
 So my question is, how do you make occasional remote work, preferably with laptops, work for resource heavy CAD users working from a shared network drive?

 I originally thought it was related to the shielded cable we used on the shop floor, or the zillion arc welders, or the multiple 480V conductor bars for any of the 10 cranes. 
 I posted a picture of it trying to arc-weld itself to its mounting hardware on the ui.com thread above (page 3), hooked to the biscuit jack with an UNshielded cable, homerun back to the grounded patch panel with the grounded STP insert for the patch panel, hooked to a Ubiquity enterprise 8-port 'enterprise' switch.
 With the ungrounded patch cable from the AP side the only thing electrical going to the AP are pins 1-8. One of those pins carrying PoE is bonded with the chassis, which I'm guessing is really a powder-coated metal. When you use the metal mounting plate and that is touching metal it makes a nice circuit, then the Ubiquity PoE switch shuts off PoE. 
 The AP works great with a grounded or ungrounded patch to the biscuit jack, just as long as it isn't touching anything metal. Swapped it out with an AP that was working fine mounted to a plywood sheet just to be sure it exhibited the same symptoms. It did.
 Doing my best not to rant, we spent a lot of time on this. The firmware roulette problems we had a couple of years ago on the UAC-PROs is still fresh on my mind.

 I got inspired lately from a post about a differences between a Cloud engineer and DevOps and as someone with mostly a traditional Linux System admin background i have found my self not enjoying so much my current role as DevOps Engineer which is focused more on a developer aspect and working on a project currently that its coming from a telecommunication company which i dont like their weird ways...or even worse the so buggy products that we have to deal.
 By said that i have told my manager that i want a career path focused mostly on Cloud and tools like terraform and Ansible. Like a Automation Engineer or Cloud Engineer...
 Do you think its a good choice for someone that doesnt enjoy development much, is all the way in for remote working and also hates the buggy products from telecommunications companies?
 When i first started working as DevOps i was feeling like it will be interesting and closer to system admin stuff but i feel disappointed now.
 Luckily my company hunts always new clients and projects so i have room to push my manager even to switch teams and clients, so i can work on stuff that i find beneficial for me.
 But whats your opinion?what stuff should i hunt to work for to avoid bad situations in work and achieve the career life i want?
 Also, I am someone that doesnt like abstract thinking or mathematical way of thinking and development so..hehe
 Do you think also for learning Green fields projects are better?
 So much questions and discuss topics that i have in my mind...

 I have Windows 10 clients and 2012 R2 servers. Was experimenting with UNC hardening trying to force encryption via the RequirePrivacy flag.
 I have a DFS namespace with 1 file server that hosts our shared folders. There is \\ourdomain.com\Data\RedirectedFolders and \\ourdomain.com\Data\Shares
 I was trying to force encryption on Shares. Shares has a target of \\fileserver1\Shares
 In my UNC hardening GPO I put \\*\Data\Shares and \\*\Shares and RequireMutualAuth, Integrity, and Privacy.
 When I open up the Shares folder (through a shortcut on the desktop that goes to \\ourdomain.com\Data\Shares or by using the actual file server name \\fileserver1\Shares) and do Get-SmbConnection in PowerShell, Encrypted returns False.
 I also tried with another server that hosts a specific shared folder. I put in the GPO \\*\ShareName and then on the client went to \\differentserver\Sharename and it still shows encrypted as False.
 Can anyone help me understand what I am missing? Is it possible to encrypt these connection via the RequirePrivacy flag?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a lab, so excuse any non-best practice stuff here, and thanks in advance for any having a look at this. 
 ​
 I need to do some policy-based routing on a Dell s50 switch running 8.4.2.7. I'm inexperienced with this in general and there's not a ton of info on doing this with Dell switches beyond the basic configuration guides.
 ​
 I've got the relevant configurations below. I've attempted to use a specific source and destination in the redirect list, applied/removed/reapplied the list in the vlan interface, etc. 
 ​
 I have a feeling I'm just missing something about how this works. 
 ​
 I have a switch with 3 vlans:
 Vlan 192 - 192.168.1.40/24
 vlan 10 - 172.16.1.1/24
 vlan 20 - 172.16.2.1/24
 ​
 ​
 I have 2 pfsense firewalls, one is in vlan 192, and is 192.168.1.1 and the other is vlan 10, 172.16.1.2.
 The switch has a default route pointing to 192.168.1.1.
 ​
 Everything works as expected in this configuration, but I need to redirect some traffic to the other pfsense firewall.
 I'm attempting to route any traffic coming from vlan 20 to 172.16.1.2 with the following configuration:
 ​
 ip redirect-list test1
 seq 5 redirect 172.16.1.2 ip any any
 ​
 interface Vlan 20
 description TEST VLAN 2
 ip address 172.16.2.1/24
 untagged GigabitEthernet 0/11-15
 ip redirect-group test1
 no shutdown
 ​
 Status output:
 ​
 switch#show ip redirect-list
 ​
 IP redirect-list test1:
 Defined as:
 seq 5 redirect 172.16.1.2 ip any any, Next-hop reachable (via Vl 10), ARP resolved
 Applied interfaces:
 Vl 20

There is no documentation what's so ever and I need to work out what's going where. My plan of attack is to check each cable with a cable tester and then hunt around for the node at the other end. There must be a quicker way.
 Was thinking about using something like lansweeper to documents everything, but I don't think it documents ports on the switch. The switches are HP Arubas. I may be answering my own question but
 Could I get a list of MAC addresses from the Switches and tally them with feedback from LanSweeper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project I’m in charge of which is due at the end of March. Now, all my ducks are in a row and I absolutely need my director’s signature on a proposal sent to us by our supplier because I don’t have the required signing power for a purchase of this magnitude. Inventory availability is an issue but there’s a hold on all of the items we need which guarantees us delivery if we sign by 4pm this coming Monday. Otherwise, we’ll lose out on substantial savings and instant rebates if we sign after Monday. Now, the last thing I want to do is go over his head to our CTO and I’ve asked him a few times if he was comfortable signing but keeps asking me to go back to the supplier and have them confirm the most minute of details which have no impact on him signing the proposal. Should I speak with my direct manager and ask his advice and maybe HE can push my director into signing it sooner rather than later? I want to deliver this project before the deadline and there are a number of things that need to be done after signing the proposal which are also incredibly time consuming (removal of old equipment, coordinating cabling, coordinating installations, down time, etc.). Even with roughly 60 days left, I feel like I’m still running out of time…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am hoping this is the right place for this because I am severely stuck. I will preface this with I have been in DevOps for 2 years and am comfortable in AWS, however networking in general is not a strong point in any way, so if this is dumb - I can take it. 
 We have a project which requires a site-to-site VPN from our AWS VPC to a customer who is running Cisco ASA. I have had the VPN set up in various ways because they keep changing requirements. However that latest requirement I am not sure how to handle. 
 Their statement is - "We look for interesting traffic on our router and when it finds it, it creates the tunnel and closes it when no longer used". So it sounds like a tunnel on-demand thing? Now, the only information we have are the endpoints in their network which we access through the tunnel. How do we send "interesting" traffic for them to create the tunnel if we need the tunnel to send our traffic? 
 I keep thinking that they didn't give us an important piece of information - like this magical endpoint. Or are we supposed to initiate the tunnel? It seems like a very chicken-and-egg situation that I am not able to wrap my head around. 
 As I said - networking neophyte here but desperately looking for some understanding of what he is talking about. So I know the right question to go back with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently found a very nice high capacity 2.5 inch PM963 for a good price that I mistook for a PM863, the SATA based cousin. So, this post is two questions.
 I wanted to possibly look into adapter options to see if I can get it to run over SATA on a basic adapter. My m.2 slots are full on my main machine, and I have no other PCIe slots. Would that be feasible? I'm unsure if U.2 runs on the same voltage as SAS. I've done a ton of digging on the matter and I can't get too clear of an answer. I've seen cheap adapters like this but I'm unsure if they'll do what I need:https://www.amazon.com/Wixine-Board-Small-Adapter-SFF-8482/dp/B08DLX9YD5?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1RV7R81U3FOKU
 Before I bought anything else I did want to see if the drive was working with what I already had laying around.I got a working T3600 with a working H310 for free last week that appears to have the latest software on it, but it couldn't see the SSD in Physical Disk Management. It had a SATA SSD in it for a boot drive and all of that worked fine before I went to switching things around. Although I'm quite certain Windows on the poor little Patriot SSD was corrupted at some point. RIP
 I could feel the U.2 slightly warm when it was plugged in which was a good sign. Physical Disk Management couldn't see it. I'm not sure if I need a new cable or other components to get this working correctly just so I can make sure the drive is good. I'm pretty green on this topic. Figured I'd come to the experts. I've done a good bit of research and asked r/IT what this even was to get the ball rolling in the right direction. I'm realizing how strange my request truly is. What would you do in my situation?

 I have setup the basic trunk but it seems to cause issues with my network.
 switchport mode trunk and switchport trunk allowed vlan [VLAN list]
 on both 10gb uplink ports
 Tried encapsulation, didnt work. I have trunked it with a 9300 and it works perfect with these commands so obviously it is something on the FS.com switch
 what am i doing wrong ? can anyone please help ?

There's a bunch of homeless around the area. I don't know what kind of circumstances in life led up to his condition, but it gave me pause for thought. 
 I like working in networking and IT. It would make me sad if I had to work another field. I'm just not sure how well I'd do in it without the use of both arms though, seeing as I need to type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am curious what the suggested best practice is for removing shared inboxes that used to be an employee regular mailbox. When an employee leaves the company, if the supervisor needs access to to their email account afterwards, we keep the user licensed and convert their email to a shared mailbox. We then remove the user license. After a month or so the supervisor will let us know that they no longer need access to the email and so we convert it back to a regular mailbox. As that user no longer has a license I assumed the inbox would disappear and senders would get a bounce back. Seems instead that the users inbox still exists and is receiving messages even though it is not licensed. I am not concerned with backups as we have that covered in another system. I am just curious what the correct method would be to remove the shared mailbox so that it disappears and users get a bounce back if they try to send to it. Seems like deleting the shared mailbox is the correct path?

 I chose schedule backup so I successfully backup the initial one (Jan 27). Then I forgot to stop the schedule backup so it was overwritten the next day ( Jan 28)
 And now I need to restore the server to the initial stae but cant no longer select the backup point on that day (Jan 27)
 Is there any way I can still restore the server on Jan 27 state?

Would you a) have the firewall handle the routing for all of the private vlans in addition to the NATing, or would you b) have a separate hardware router device handle the routing between the private vlans and then set the gateway of last resort to point to an ip address on the pfSense firewall?

 First time setting up two routers in a HA pair using the HSRP protocol;
 My ISP is providing me two links and two IPs (for each routers) plus a virtual IP. So far so good.
 What's not adding up for me is that they insist that the gateway IP I must use on the WAN side (first hop) is the same IP as my virtual IP (WAN Gateway IP == VIP). And of course my equipment is refusing to apply this config... "cannot use same IP as gateway for the Virtual IP".
 I read a bunch of documentation but I still cannot understand how that would work.
 Equipment is Meraki MX105

 in order to recertify my CCNP I plan to take the 350-901 DEVCOR exam. I hope you can share with me what one can expect in the exam while respecting the NDA of course. Here's what I mean.
 It is a well-known fact that CCNA and CCNP level exams do not use actual devices for the exam, not even virtualized OS. Configuration tasks are done in a mock-up CLI environment with limited functionality. How are DevNet exams in this regard? For any "implement script utilizing API X", is there a full-blown Python shell available, with help() and introspection? Is there any API documentation available, or is candidate expected to know all the different product APIs intimately?
 I have 10+ years of experience in Python and network automation, I've written 10k+ LoCs of Python for network automation, new Ansible modules, thousands of LoCs of Ansible playbooks and roles, integrated different vendors' products and APIs, I've worked with UCS/Firepower/Netmiko/onePK/NETCONF/etc, but I am not too keen on memorizing APIs of products that may become legacy next year. What are my chances of passing with limited study only to refresh Docker and look into Kubernetes that I never used before?
 Thanks for your replies.

 I’ll be in charge of a department to resolve issues for professors, set up new machines on the domain with sufficient apps, recommending/purchasing new devices for department/faculty/staff, etc. This department is mainly Apple with a few hits of windows computers. 
 My questions:
  
Anyone have tips and tricks as a new IT person?
 Any advice on setting up new computers? For right now, I’ve been setting them up with a local admin account, then adding the device to our Domain, putting my own AD credentials as admin, then installing apps such as O365, Cisco vpn, adobe CC, and such. It’s mostly manual work.. I’ve never scripted before but would like to get this automated.
  
Any advice is super helpful and I’m excited to grow in this role. Thank you!
 EDIT: I should say most of the devices I will set up will not be shared, but staff want to start using their AD logins instead of having local accounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I stumbled across a feature in Windows Server 2022 called SMB Compression which, according to my understanding, allows quicker transfer of files over your network by compressing files (if you tell it to). The concept seems relatively straight forward, I think in practice you can use SMB Compression by:
 • Using Robocopy with a /compress switch in your CLI
 • Mapping a network drive using Net using the /requestcompression:yes switch
 • Enabling this option in the Windows Admin Center on a File Server so file copying will default to using compression when end users copy to or from the network share folder on a server with this option enabled.
 My question is - is my relative understanding of this feature, more or less, accurate? Also when it comes to file compression, don't you lose quality when it comes to files such as jpegs, or does it compress the files to transfer them, thus lowering bandwidth requirements, and then decompress the files once it reaches the destination?
 Is this feature relatively esoteric? There really seems like no downsides unless the files stay compressed. Any admins out there successfully utilize this? Thanks all.

In other words - would you be interested in having your state/country offer you the ability to sign documents with your driver's license/state ID card? You set the pin/etc when you get your license, and then you could perform critical functions by using your certificate vs having to go into physical locations.

It's a great moment that can catapult me from L1 helpdesk(which I've currently been in for the past 3 years) to system administration. What are some tips that i should know to make the most of this or shine well -what i can think of right now is I should introduce scripts that will automate some tasks.

I feel like I have a decent level of knowledge in a lot of things. And I do know I lack some knowledge in others.
 I feel like I should be really going down a specific path at this point, whether it’s networking, security, Windows, etc. 
 Anxiety comes over me when I try to decide whether I should learn new stuff or really focus on one discipline. Which causes me to think I’m not doing the right thing, and then I end up frozen with worry.

While most regions and services had recovered by 09:00 UTC, intermittent packet loss issues were fully mitigated by 12:43 UTC.

 We are a team of three and we all work from home. One of the members of the team will disappear for hours throughout the day. This is not only affecting our team's performance, but also our mental health. Projects that rely on him have been delayed for months. He says he stays up all night to finish stuff, yet nothing is finished. He doesn't even do the bare minimum and our manager is aware of this. This has been going on for over a year now. We have to do double work because of him and we are both exhausted.
 My other teammate and I have both complained to our manager. Our manager says he is talking to HR, but it is very hard to let someone go. Nothing has changed so far. Our manager is a very nice person. A little too nice IMO.
 This guy finds creative excuses every time.
 We recently found out he is the owner of an IT consulting company. Do we bring this to our manager's attention? We feel like we need to confront him.
 Let me also say I don't want to leave my company. I mean if I have to, I definitely will. I've been through one burn out and I don't won't to go through another one.

 We have an online portal where our customers can log in with SAML. The portal has also contained our homepage - so both of these have been running on www.ourdomain.com. 
 We're now in the process of building a new homepage on a new tech-stack (WordPress). This will split our solution into 2: 
 - The new homepage running on www.ourdomain.com
 - The portal (with the SAML functionality) running on portal.ourdomain.com
 Here-in lies the issue. All of our customers have their SAML setup pointing af www.ourdomain.com - but in the future, our SAML setup will be hosted at portal.ourdomain.com. Is there a best approach to redirecting (or something else) the SAML requests to our portal and let this handle the login process? Or do we need to tell all of our customers to update their SAML configuration? 
 All of our customers' metadata is pointing to e.g. www.ourdomain.com/saml and www.ourdomain.com/metadata 
 If at all possible, we'd like to avoid telling our customers to update their SAML setups (as many of them will be using manual metadata). 
 Is there a smart way to do this with redirects / re-posts etc. that wont break the existing SAML setup by moving it to a subdomain? 
 Thanks a lot guys.

Microsoft 365 available
 Security is important (Can a 2-factor login be set up with Windows?)
 Insider Risk Management (tips, tricks, software)
 Easy update, patch management
 Group Policies (More tips, tricks?) (Is it possible with M365 or do we need an Domain Controller)

 Since everyone and every technology stack I know is capable of using NAT, I dont see much a use for it, is there companies out there who stricly use IPV6 only? I imagine even if they wanted to make their whole organisation IPV6 and disable IPv4 this would lead to some legacy systems not being able to work correctly.
 Am I wrong ? Can someone enlight me with the benefits in having IPV6 is that something it will become more implemented in the future you think?

 Now as only some clients are needed with a 5 Gbit Network to the Server I've installed a Zyxel Nebula 1930-10 Switch (8x 10Gbit, 2x SFP+).
 The necessary Clients mostly with 5Gbit USB (Qnap Adapter) are already connected to the Zyxel Nebula Switch. Should I replace the old Cisco 24Port with a faster Switch or just connect the old cisco sg200-26 via Uplink to my new Zyxel Nebula Switch? If yes: What SFP Module would you recommend? I see there are some no-name modules which can be flashed for common Switch brands.

Today in passing I made a comment about how with tax returns and the upcoming bonus I was told about its going to be a fun next month. My coworkers looked at me confused and chuckled "what bonus?" I explained what I was told in the hiring process and they said they have no idea what I was told about and they've never received that. Honestly pretty pissed and im hoping they were pulling my leg, might be looking for a new gig towards the end of next month.. Any tips on dealing with recruiters again? Any recommendations on a safe one to reach out to?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I was wondering if I can use power apps to make a form that would basically guide a user through submitting a change request.
 Basically, there are about 4 different type of requests. Each one can branch off into a few different fields. Some of the fields will ask the user to fill out an external excel file and attach it. For these fields I want to add links to external training documents so they know how to fill out the excel file. Some requests require 1 approver, while others require none or multiple. Some selections should even prevent a user from submitting the form because a change request is not required. 
 Right now this change request is requested through email so there’s a lot of user error with what people submit. I’m hoping a form like this can make it dummy proof. Is power apps the right tool for something like this?

I've been beating my head against a wall now for months fighting with Zayo and troubleshooting speed issues we're having with a 1G DIA circuit from them. We're colocated in a datacenter with them, and the uplink from their handoff to our gateway is SMF, about 50 feet away.
 Our gateway is a Ubiquiti UISP Console, which if you're not familiar, is 10G capable. So it's well up to the task. We also had similar speeds with both a UISP Router, and an Edgerouter X SFP. The SMF uplink is connected through a 1G SFP module.
 Running the built in UISP speed test, which originates on the gateway, we always get in the 200-300Mb download range, and 900Mb+ upload. I've gotten the same results from a laptop testing through WifiMan, SpeedTest, TestMy, DSLReports, etc. All the same.

 - Bit of protection for when things go badly
 - Legally required because Vyvanse script?
 Why not tell them?
 - Already been a bit hard in the last 12mo and am on a performance plan (silly stuff that I knew the risks of, already massively improving, no further complaints from boss for a while)
 - Already shared some personal life info when I needed to provide extra care for my partner having a MH crisis, and that didnt seem to really do anything positive at all.
 - hate sharing private info
 - Not believed and maybe ridiculed behind closed doors?
 - May not deliver the benefits I hope for and just continue to make them think Im shit.
 Ive kept things brief here but can expand if needed. For now, assume Im a pretty capable l2/sysadmin kinda person that has yet to need any sev 1 or afterhours/OnCall escalated because I couldnt handle the people and/or resolve the problem.
 Thoughts?

We only have a 1gbps link between sites and maybe 200 100GB VMs. Everything was working fine until.... we noticed our backup system. We noticed that it thinks the failed over vm at the new site is a new VM. So now we have two back ups of the same vm. Has anyone experienced this before? We do not want to vmotion each on over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! We built a NetMotion Secure Access server on our server VLAN (10.1.4.0), with the intent of having VPN clients reach out to a DHCP server and get an IP from a newly created 10.1.74.0/24 range. However, I'm trying to conceptualize how this would work with regards to routing and our firewalls. A couple of notes:
  
NetMotion, as far as I know, has no configurable static routing/VLAN assignment/etc
 In order for clients to get an IP from the desired range, we give the server an IP to use from it (10.1.74.5). The server sends DHCP requests using that address
  
With that said, I suppose my question two-fold:
  
How exactly would that work? If our firewall sees packets from the 10.1.74.0 subnet coming in on the server VLAN, it will block them, correct? Is there a logical way to allow access without creating a bunch of weird access policies?
 How do we configure routes for traffic destined for the VPN subnet? Would it be as simple as creating a static route that points to the server's IP? Any past experience I've had with VPN involved them living on firewalls that did all of our routing, so it seems foreign doing things this way.
  
Any thoughts you folks have would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a small company, I don't do networking as a career or anything but we hit a slow period of work and I'm a bit geeky so I looked into updating our old "server" and trying to get better than 100 megabit transfer speeds. 
 We were using an old PC running Windows 7 with a few hard drives in it that was being shared on the network and that was it, that's how they've ran it for like 10 years. I just Frankensteined a pc with TrueNAS on it, I went to our network closet and saw that our cabling was Cat5, sadly didn't realize it was only Cat5, not 5e, so we ordered a Gigabit network switch and plugged her in and.... No gigabit speeds. Damn. Still only 10mbps when transfering to ol Frankenstein. Now I'm talking to the owner about running new lines under the building with Cat5e or Cat6a. Owner is kind of down, Co-owner who is 20 years younger is less down and thinks its absolutely not worth it and will barely impact our workflow. 
 I've done a rough estimate on the plugs we actually use in the building, about 700' worth of cable so we'd buy a 1000' spool. My concern is the owners wife wants the building to be usable for the next person if they ever sell. When they built the place in 2006, they ran the Cat5 IN THE WALL using the "Home Run" method, where they drilled holes in every.. 2x4... and pulled the ethernet cable through. The owner is pretty sure they also stapled them to the 2x4s every so often. So there is no way of pulling them out. I think we reuse the current ethernet outlet spot, ditch the cable in the wall, and back in the "network closet" we shove the cat 5 cable in the wall and patch the drywall. Unless there is another use for Cat5 I'm not aware of that would be a good reason to get a dual plug and actually have both and make both usable. That would kind of solve both issues. Anyone have any ideas?

 I took over as IT Manager for a small firm about 6 months ago, replacing an MSP. We got what we needed from them and kicked them out, and now have no contact.
 One of my requests to the MSP before departure was to remove us from their partner portal, as I have no ability to do that from the tenant. Surprise, this was never done! I've contacted MS "support" through the O365 admin page and they've basically told me to go fuck myself and it's stuck there forever. For luck I've put in about 20 tickets on this, one actually got close. I feel like MS can absolutely do this if I fill out 700 forms and what not. 
 Is there any way I can get this relationship off the tenant? Every time I need to purchase licenses it gets in the way by two clicks, and I'm tired of being reminded that an MSP has us in their poral somewhere. Their access is neutered but it still feels like they're part of the setup when they aren't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am starting to plan out our Windows 11 Upgrade for next year and would like to know how you are upgrading clients from Windows 10 to 11.
 When we went from Windows 7 to 10 we deployed new or rebuilt devices but have upgraded Windows 10 in place for new feature updates successfully for the past few years (as everyone else in the world). I'm now desensitized to upgrading the client OS with an upgrade. Years ago that would have been heresy and clients would be upgraded with a fresh OS install.
 Are you treating Windows 11 as a Feature Upgrade and just upgrading in place or are you taking the more intense route of deploying a new device with a fresh image? I'd love to hear your thoughts and strategies.

I assume this would be something like PRTG or similar? Is there anything quick and dirty that doesn't involve an entire setup as such that can be used? I'm merely curious - trying to get and understand as many options as possible. 
 This is an area or skillset that I lack and want to get better at so any and all recommendations are welcome.

 PCI3 has a 8GT/s capacity or 8GB/s one way (16GB/s duplex) for a 8x slot. 
 There are PCIe3 cards supporting dual 100Gb cards which is 12.5GB/s, exceeding the 8GB/s limit. 
 Ignoring GT/s and encoding loss, how would one achieve these speeds on a single 8x slot?

 APC shipped us two brand new batteries instead of a warranty replacement for a small UPS. The battery pack is APC RBC 140, which appear to be for the Smart-UPS RT 5000VA. Instead of returning these two perfectly good batteries to them, they are telling me to drop them off at any random local recycler.
 I have absolutely no need for these. I'm not interested in spending any time trying to sell them. So, if you have a UPS/FedEx account and can send me a shipping label I'll send them to you if you have a need for them. Box is approximately 80 pounds, 30"x17"x9". Or, if you are in the Houston area you can stop by and pick them up. 
 Send me a private message if you want them. If not, I'll take them to a recycler next week.

 We are a small business and so far MSP was handling the ASA 5515 firewall. We have let go of MSP and I am tasked with managing the firewall. I don't have much routing & switching knowledge (CCENT years ago). This may change, we might bring in network admin to configure the firewall and I guess I need to learn on the way to manage it. I might have to get a CCNA. I am a fairly new sysadmin for mostly linux/AWS and some windows.
 Currently we have about 15 users that use cisco anyconnect on Windows workstations and 6 linux users that use openconnect debian package for VPN. The internet speed is 250 Mbps symmetrical. 80% of infrastructure would be moved to cloud. Which firewall should be suitable for upgrading ? PA-440 would probably the most expensive although I don't even know the ballpark of the cost. 
 Edit: We have four Ubiquiti USW-48 switches and one Dell Force10 S25. Two Unifi U6-LR access points. Less than 50 workstations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little background. I started at this place fairly recently. Just prior to me starting, their accounting department decided to move from some antique accounting software, to using quickbooks. The sysadmin before me set them up with QB desktop and with the company files hosted on VM at a remote data center (which is a couple hundred miles away).
 Big surprise, the previous guy apparently never read the documentation from QB that clearly states accessing a company file over VPN is a shit show. Its massively slow. Like often taking 10+ minutes for a company file to open. To make things worse, the accounting department is using quickbooks in an unusual way, where they have hundreds of company files that all need to be accessible to the ~20 accountants. So throughout the day theyre switching between files and literally spending hours waiting on shit to load. Also, this means quickbooks online is not an option, because you pay per company file, and the service would be absurdly expensive.
 My first thought was to set up a NAS locally and based on some testing, this works great. Its nearly as fast as having the company files on the host. But to throw another wrench in things, the accountants often need to work from home. The DC and ASA are at the data center, and when using VPN from home theyre tunneling all the way to this data center and then all the way back to our office. This is actually so slow that most of the time you cant even open a company file.
 I know the proper solution is to run QB in a VM and use RDS, which I could easily do at our data center, but for whatever reason my boss is vehemently against this option.
 At this point I kind of at a loss. Any advice would be greatly appreciated...

 They offer a very competitive raise (almost double what I am making now).
 I am just not familiar with this concept. The recruiting company is one with good reputation and reviews, however the 6 months thing scares me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi Gig Small Office recommendations
 Hi Networking! I’m primarily an AV engineer but a facility I work with is looking to expand their 10 gig network. It’s a small office, less than 50 users (currently somewhere around 20 but may expand in the next few years), with several file servers on premise and a couple internet accessible services (behind reverse proxy through Argo tunnel). 
 What we need: -10GBe access layer to the workstations. -high reliability -Ability to VLAN/ACL various devices for access to various file servers. So basically, nothing unmanaged. -Likely higher throughput trunks between servers and switches, and between switches. All our servers are equipped with 4x10gbe. Probably a good implementation of LACP and STP. -that’s it!
 What we would like: -centralized-ish management, ability to manage with APs would be a huge bonus. 
 What we don’t really need: -POE
 Currently I run Meraki at my office, and I think this would be perfect but the cost of getting several MS355-24X (otherwise a perfect switch) might be prohibitive, and the license would compound that. I also run an Aruba Instant On network (automod removed my post for saying where), and their 1960 12XGT looks very interesting and priced very well, but I haven’t used any of their multi gig offerings. I like the ability to integrate with their wifi6 APs at a great price point too. Also highly considering the Cisco CBS 350 12XT and CBS 350 24XT. 
 Just looking for opinions and thoughts! Thanks

 Where do you guys find time to learn and get familiar with new systems or systems you want to demo while staying up to date on Helpdesk-level problems? 
 Maybe it's due to my priority break down of things. Here's my list of priorities as an IT Manager/Sole Sysadmin.
  
Problems stopping production / customers production
 Urgent requests / Priority requests
 Upper Management requested issues
 General Helpdesk Issues (anything from a single spam email to ERP/CRM report reworks)
 Network Maintenance Issues
 Network Update / Upgrading projects
 Learning new material time
  
I'm not sure at what point it's enough volume to justify a second set of hands, but I can basically never get to 5/6/7 unless I work overtime hours.
 Does this make sense and has anyone else ran into this issue?

I traced the offices lines, plugged each respective line into the dedicated switches and plugged them into the ports I was told to in their firewall. 
 After everything was all said and done, I come back to the office and asked my supervisor "couldn't we have just made things easier by using one switch and separate the network using VLANS?". He responded "Well, if something were to happen to the switch, such as a shock to the system, the switch would reset & lose all configurations which would cause havoc". I was sitting there thinking to myself....well then by that reasoning, why everything else? Everything in tech is just as susceptible to that scenario. If you propose that scenario, then why even have managed switches? 
 I recognize that that is an extreme scenario he gave but how realistic is that? Has that ever happened to anyone? Are there way's to mitigate it? Redundancy? Make the switch pull the start-up file from external server? Please help me understand and educate me :) Thank you for your time!

However, we're having some issues getting schools that are interested, up and running which turns out to almost always be firewall / content-filtering related. Even giving it away for free, many schools just give up once they hit the problem.
 I'm hoping you can help answer some questions, as we've asked to speak to a couple of school admins who have deployed our app successfully to understand your world/struggles better, but so far we just get responses like "it's outsourced to X grid for learning, speak to them".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this issue started out as one site just timing out. The site worked on literally every other network. Had a colleague that is close by that also has a zayo connection test with the same behavior. Zayo of course is no help. Claiming it's not their network. Their tech support also called me at 130am that was fun. As time has gone on there have been more and more sites we have issues accessing. Seen at least 5 now that number could be higher as some teachers probably just don't report it and move on to something else. Have had the same colleague test those sites on their zayo connection with the same behavior. They all give some form of forbidden message. In the meantime I got our backup circuit setup in an sd-wan configuration on our firewall. So I just add those fqdn to the address group that is routed strictly out the backup circuit and they work just fine again. Has anyone ever had issues like this with an ISP? If so were you able to get it resolved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to move away from Zix since we already have the Office 365 e5 compliance add on license for our users. Our Security team requires the ability to revoke messages. With Zix this is easily done by them. However, Following Microsoft's best practice, we only have 3 global admins accounts. (2 users in PIM, 1 break glass). Our security team is not a global admin. Typically these revocations tend to be time sensitive and having our 2 global admins on call 24/7 for something ,IMO, as trivial as revoking an email is absurd. 
 Is the ability to revoke a message as an administrator really a global admin responsibility? Did anyone come up with a clever workaround this permission limitation? 
 Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/revoke-ome-encrypted-mail?view=o365-worldwide#step-3-revoke-the-mail
 Seems a bit silly when the Security Administrators role already have the ability to purge messages using Data Explorer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I am a rookie in the IT business and have a client with a very odd internet connectivity issue.
 At random times browsing the web becomes extremly slow networkwide. So slow that it timesout. At first I thought it was a DNS related issue but when using tools like ping/tracert/nslookup there is no problem. And browsing to google.se and doing google searches is very quick.
 Doing a speedtest shows nothing wrong there.
 ​
 And when I say random times I mean random times. The issue comes from out of nowhere and persists between 1-3 hours and then just disapears and everything goes back to normal.
 But has lately been occuring more and more. It used to occur once every month give or take. Now its more like every other day.
 The firewall used is a Zyxel USG FLEX 200 with latest firmware running in nebula mode and is not even a year old.
 DHCP server is on the firewall and DNS servers is set to 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8
 rebooting the firewall does not help.
 Almost all clients run on ethernet. I talked to the ISP and they could not see any issues on their end. 
 I dont know what else to test/troubleshoot and could use some ideas.
 Any help is appreciated. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I took some wireshark scans of our RDP app while I connected using my ip address and searching for the url of the app. We have two different networks on site. Network C is the main network, and Network X is the secondary network I have in my office to remote into other off sites.
 Once I captured the scans they appear to be completely different ways of communicating. I can see the the app on the C network communicates using HTTP 1.1 and it goes through a few hoops. I can see the app on X network communicates via DNS. The scans for X Network do not show HTTP linked to this app at all and the scans for C Network do not show DNS at all. The DNS method is much quicker than the HTTP method.
 My question is does that mean that the older C Network is using older/different networking protocols to launch/connect to the app? Does that mean that our newer X Network is using a DNS network to automatically connect the app each time making it quicker?
 I would post the scans but there's confidential information in the data.

After two days, every VPN address loses connection to virtual network for few hours. The next day, everything goes back to normal.
 I hope you can somehow understand problem description :p What could be the issue here?

 I can check permissions (after clicking advanced to continue so I can see them) and they're correct, no deny anywhere and effective access claims I should be allowed, but nope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 for Various reasons the specific Server has a Supermicro M11SDV-8C+-LN4F. It only has one PCIe x16 Slot. The NVME Slot is populated with the OS Drive, 2x 2,5 SATA SSDs are in a RAID-1 and this Server needs 1x SFP+ for 10GBit AND a SAS-HBA for an LTO-8 Tapedrive.
 Except using risers and splitters to make two 8x PCIe Slots out of the x16, there don't seem to be any way to do this... No USB to SAS (the Tape drive only does 60-70 MB/s anyway and i only need one single SAS Connection as well), 10 Gbit SFP+ USB-Adapters are only availble with Thunderbolt (or so it seems)
 Another issue is: The Server is only 1U. So trying to shoehorn a 2x Riser in to that case will be another issue entirely.
 Anyone got some ideas?

So, at our company I was tasked with finding a RMA software solution for managing defective products returns that we could implement locally or (preferably) buy a cloud solution. We don't have big requirements so the software should (at least) be able to connect to our existing local ERP, to get customer and our products data, should support/have built-in RMA forms for customers to send us their RMA requests and get RMA progress updates (optionally some sort of barebone ticketing system or simply sending update e-mails) and have scheduled or ondemand reporting capability for our management (so we can identify products with most defects, what are those defects, etc.).
 We are not a big company with only around 50 employees, but have quite a few customers (we manufacture products for customers) so the software solution should be a reliable one.
 Thank you in advance for your recommendations!

 I was about to order transceivers and an optic able from fs.com but then I looked at the "Connectivity Solutions" at the bottom of the product page and got a bit confused.
 I have a Mikrotik Routerboard with an SFP+ cage and a Netgear M4100 POE Switch with an SFP cage. I want to connect them using 1gb bidi SM transceivers.
 For the Mikrotik Routerboard I chose this one:https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/75335.html?attribute=10243&id=198431
 And for the Netgear Switch this one:https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/32768.html?attribute=10243&id=198433
 And I connect them using this fiber cable:https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/40446.html
 ​
 "Connectivity Solutions" at the bottom of the page suggests transceivers with reversed TX/RX
 Transceiver 1: 1310nm-TX/1490nm-RX Transceiver 2: 1490nm-TX/1310nm-RX
 I thought both transceivers need to have the same TX/RX for BiDi?
 Hope somebody can help me. Thanks in advance!

 ​
  
NinjaRMM - only 200+ third-party apps
 Atera - uses Chocolatey/Homebrew catalog, which I'm unsure about
 ManageEngine - has an impressive 1200+ catalog, but UI could use a refresh
  
I think the last two are good choices, but any other recommendations based off of my current requirements?

 So I’m working on certificate based authentication for our Wifi network. We currently have a policy which looks at an AD group and grants access passing through credentials.
 I’ve created a NPS policy for the certificate and in the logs I can see that’s working as intended.
 The catch is when a user does not have a certificate / isn’t part of the AD group they can still authenticate with their credentials. Do I need to add a Deny rule in? I can’t see the user in the logs at this point either.
 Send help!

We wanted Intune or a similar solution so we can finally move away from having to type in a users password (especially if they already work for us) and setup the laptop manually. Got rejected for it being too expensive for everyone. On my question on how we should move forward with this as setting up laptops manually takes a lot of time, time which we could use for productive work, they told us to just hire students.
 This will be fun when we up our workforce by roughly a third this year and have them all start working on the same day. This will totally work and we will totally won't have issues with this approach, because giving some random students laptops with little to no possible oversight who are doing a brain-dead task will work out.
 So any ideas on other solutions? We will have to deploy devices on a regular basis for all offices and a person having to wait 1-2 business days to work again (us shipping them a device from HQ or in that office a student being there setting up a device) is not an option

 The requirement is to standardize/centralize it, but allow users to edit to their specific details (if required).
 Seems copy/paste of a template seems to stump many users, and sometimes the images don't paste correctly? People then seem to make up their own crap.
 Do people use transport rules and AAD attributes? Can you use images with those? I'd imagine with TRs, there's no room for any of those people who the standard template wouldn't suit..?
 For signatures that reference external hosted images, do they run risk of not loading/displaying on the recipients email client?
 3rd party tool?
 Local PowerShell script? But then is it per user or machine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I normally deal with Cisco and ubiquiti. So this is my first run in with sonicwall. Client of mine has an office for creative marketing and they have about 30 people in at a time using various applications(social media,Dropbox,zoom,google meets) they have a shared gigabit connection from isp and dedicated ethernet is not an option unfortunately. They are hard set on keeping the sonicwall and they haven’t been able to find anyone willing to configure it properly for them so I offered to check it out. The issue they are having is during peak time is buffering,web pages not loading etc… I took a look into there sonicwall and there is no bandwidth management configured at all. Just one CFS rule for default content filtering. My question is there a straight forward way to set up bandwidth profiles or a global rule to limit bandwidth for each user? My guess is out of the 30 users a few are uploading heavily to Dropbox and saturating the circuit.

I help to manage a global MPLS network [BGP/ISIS/OSPF] and I'm the resident wireless/ISE SME. The thing I struggle with is that I could be much better than I am. I don't mean to suggest that I'm a poor employee, I get solid reviews every year.
 I guess it's just that I know I could be a CCIE level person but I just can't seem to squeeze that much effort out of myself. I study but it's for a bit here and there. I maintain a decent knowledge base but I find it so hard to push myself. Does anyone here relate? How did you energize yourself to study hard and lab stuff up to really drive yourself to a high level?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a systems engineer for a national healthcare company. We recently decom'd a data center and used a company to relocate a piece of hardware to another one of our datacenters several states away, and used a second company to take away the remaining old decom'd hardware that we no longer needed.
 I've handled nearly all of the quoting, selections, and coordination during this process. On the day for both companies to perform their duties, it was just a disaster. Neither company should've had the problems that they had, putting us in situations we shouldn't have had to be in. This is not the first time I've dealt with bad IT recycling companies...
 It got me thinking and throwing an idea around with a couple of friends. One, an owner of a small trucking company, and another who's a CPA and a part-time small business owner. We're thinking of forming an IT relocation, destruction, and recycling company.
 What issues have you had dealing with these companies? What kind if services are you looking for in such a company? Are you looking for such a company to quickly and simply haul away your old equipment, or do you have equipment of value that you no longer need, and want to have such a company pay some for it to be able to resell? Do you only care about certificates of destruction? Do you want said company to do all the labor, un-racking all your old gear and handle the entire decom/relocation process, or simply have them pick up the already removed hardware, ready to go at the dock? What's most important to you? If quotes of two companies were identical, what would make you choose one over the other? 
 It seems like there's a lot of players in the industry, but I haven't had a company provide these services without throwing wrenches into the works. To err is human, but a lot of the mistakes and issues I've seen are completely avoidable. I can do better.
 You wanna talk me out of it? Why? You wanna talk me into it? Why?

 I have a client that I am now the main IT personnel for, at a school, that needs VPN access using their Barracuda VPN Client.
 They can connect to the school.
 They get an IP Address, DNS Servers, and a DHCP server all listed.
 But they aren't getting a Gateway from the CloudGen Firewall.
 I checked the settings, and there is definitely a Gateway listed. I tried setting the Gateway to the same address scheme of their DHCP service, and to the IP Address of the LAN DHCP service. Both times, ipconfig /all showed an empty space where the Gateway should be. 
 Anyone have any ideas why the Gateway wouldn't show up at all?
 Thanks much!

 2) Is there anyway to get an email notification when there's errors? If it works as expected and shows if a user isn't syncing if there was a way to be notified it'd be great

 ​
 Also, writing this now, the internet comes from a main server switch that runs into a patch panel. Instead of: patch panel -> router -> switch should I do: patch panel -> switch -> router ?
 ​
 Also Also, switches would be on a budget by the company so can't spend even more than a few hundred for a switch most likely, if my only options for a managed switch are ones in the high high price range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, recently the business I work for has been having frequent outages with our ISP. I have been asked to come up with a backup solution until the other ISP becomes available in the area. We got a 5G Business Hotspot from T-Mobile. Connection is great and we only have between 50-70 essential devices online at any given time. 
 We just received the router and I am reading up on how to configure it properly. I will do my best to list the relevant facts about our network.
 ​
 Firewall is running Cisco ASDM 7.14
 ISP comes in through modem, routes to firewall and then firewall plugs to our LAN via Network Switches
 A Physical Windows Server provides DHCP for the network
 Same server is our DC as well
 ​
 I am wondering what I have to configure on the firewall to make sure it will allow the Hotspot to give internet connection to our devices without messing with their IP's or anything on the internal network.
 ​
 Maybe this is simpler than I am making it out to be and I just need to allow the external IP of the hotspot, disable DHCP on it then call it a day, but I'm not sure.
 They would also like me to configure it specifically just as a failover, so if the ISP goes down the firewall routes over to the hotspot automatically? But I am not sure if that is possible. Any help would be appreciated!

 I'm trying to decide whether or not I should even bother trying to have the conversation with someone in upper management that at least two of their senior people are about to GTFO because there's no need for them to be in the office. Managers, I get it - they should be there since they need to chat with people and be a face to management. Sysadmin and netadmin and secadmin under them? Probably not unless they're meeting a vendor, need to be there for a meeting with management, or need to do something specific on-site.
 I could see and hear in this morning's meeting that some people instantly checked the fuck out. I think that the IT Manager missed it or is just hoping to ignore it.
 They already have positions open that they haven't staffed. I wonder why they think this will make it better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AT&T offers a 5Gbps fiber Internet product with an ARRIS BW320 modem/router. The BW320 has a 5Gbps copper (5GBASE-T) LAN port. The Meraki MX450 has two dedicated SFP+10GbE uplink ports. Will the MX450 support an uplink connection to the BW320 running at the maximum speed of the BW320 LAN port (5Gpbs)?
 I know there exist 1.25/2.5/5/10G SFP+ RJ45 Copper Transceivers. If I use one in the MX450 will that give me a 5Gbps link to the BW320?
 Thanks.

Routers worked just fine without much issue but it took me a few months (on and off) of tweaking this and that and solving an insane amount of tiny little things for it to finally work, only for me to take my laptop somewhere else then bring it home and now the networking portion is all messed up and wonky again
 I tried EVE NG recently and I love how they have a bunch more Cisco options and it's easier to get the images but man, none of them work aside from maybe a router. After a bunch of tweaking I finally got a WSA to turn on and that's it. I've been trying for days just to get a freakin L2 switch on there. Thought I finally got one only to have the image be a router. Tweaked one thing and now it won't even turn on. I have to try getting experience on firepower and FMC and followed Rob Rikers tutorial on it and some of the EVE commands in the shell don't even work.
 I've spent i don't know how many months just trying to get a single dang simulator to work and it's been nothing short of a soul sucking experience. Wondering if I'm just an outlier here...

 So if you have been following my post you will know about the fight for porting numbers I have been in. 
 Well ATT rep for our company has been more than help these last 6.5 months. He has provided all the info and then some that we need. However some of our numbers still are being rejected. The rep had tried everything except dogging back to when att took control of our previous sip vendor (without a date, time etc.) from the sound of it and recommends new numbers.
 But management still is not budging and we are back at tracing the numbers and circuits. To the point it is interfering with my after work home life and me studying for my degree.
 I am more than done with project and desperately please for any ideas.

Our environment is a hybrid AD/Azure AD and due to the nature of our business we will likely remain that way for a long time. Our users are already logging in with smartcard but we are looking for something a little more modern. 
 With smartcard login already established we have all of the PKI, DC, and other pre-reqs in place for the key trust method. It seems like enabling this would be as simple as adding the Azure AD user to the Key admins group, and enabling the GPO on a few test accounts. 
 Reading through the docs i see MS is now heavily pushing the cloud trust method over the key trust. The big driver is simplicity without the needs for all the PKI and other setup. 
 Sometimes what MS pushes is whats best for them and not for the customer. So what are your thoughts with the existing PKI in place if you were doing a new WHfB setup would you go key trust or cloud trust.

 When we get internet connectivity, Teams go online and the user status get updated (available) and see also the status of other company users.
 At that time, if we receive a call (Teams to Teams or outside call), we don't get any notification and the caller is directly redirected to his voicemail.
 The user has set the option to "Calls ring me", "Also ring" to "No One Else" and If unanswered to voicemail after 20 seconds (default).
 To be able to receive a call, we have to call someone or close completely Teams and restart with internet connectivity.
 We opened a support ticket at Microsoft and they answered that it is by design and we should remove the option "Auto-start application" which is set by default and wait to have internet connectivity before starting Teams.
 Does it make sense to you ? Do you also encounter the problem ? Do you have a solution ?

 Event ID 14 - A RADIUS message was received from RADIUS client with an invalid authenticator. This is typically caused by mismatched shared secrets. Verify the configuration of the shared secret for the RADIUS client in the Network Policy Server snap-in and the configuration of the network access server.
 I've made sure the shared secrets match by creating a template then copying and pasting directly into the AP controller. I've also tried with a shortened shared secret in case it was an issue with it being too long (didn't think this would be the case as clients authenticate fine but worth a try) and rebooting the NPS server (after reading online this had sorted it for someone else).
 Any ideas what is causing this? On average there is an error logged every few seconds (30 ish RADIUS clients)

 Quick one, has anyone got experience with a good product for multiple staff members to remotely access only 1 or 2 machines from onsite/remote with both PCs and mobiles? Found out staff have been using a single TeamViewer account and Chrome Remote desktop via a single email to connect to these machines as they run status software for production. 
 Wanting to be able to add a layer of visibility and security from the IT side. Mainly being able to restrict users that are able to access, block access after leaving and also auditing whos connected to the machine. TeamViewer would work but it's expensive and they're an absolutely terrible vendor to deal with, any other ones also seem to be focused on both high user and machine count so ends up being too pricy.
 Anyone used anything they could recommend? Thank you

 I'm looking for a remote patch mgmt software solution. Basically, keeping local and remote devices (mostly win server and linux ubuntu/centos) up to date. I'm not looking for a full RMM, just basic OS patching, preferably a cloud solution with remote agents. I'm currently looking at:
  
Manageengine patch management plus pro
 Automox
 Sanernow
  
Any other names I should definitely take a look at?
 Thanks

 Except: as it turns out, the server-side iterations are designed in such a way that they don’t offer any security benefit. What remains are 100,000 iterations performed on the client side, essentially the same iteration protection level as for LastPass until only a few days ago when they upped the iterations to 350,000 for newly created accounts.

 Here are technical details about our other recent migration from Redis. Briefly, we became limited by the per-core performance of the new CPUs, and KeyDB proved to be an easy-to-use drop-in replacement (removing a performance bottleneck we were struggling with).
 On the other hand, it is quite a specific case and related to our willingness to minimise migration efforts (instead of using sharding, etc.). It would be interesting to see other experiences.

 Please excuse my limited knowledge.. I'm working for an editor who offers his app through RemoteApp on Windows Server 2019.
 This software generates Excel reports (through data injection in templates). When we set up those machines a few months ago, I'm 99% positive that, with no Excel installed on the server, when we generated an Excel file, the local Excel (on the users machine) was used. Today, this isn't the case anymore. Users connect to this RemoteApp through RDP.
 Would you know what I can edit to achieve this? Or is it just me who don't remeber correctly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First big mistake in the industry after 5 years being in this company.
 Long story short, I deleted a keyvault in Azure which was used by a production DB server to encrypt the databases. The keyvault did not have the soft delete feature as it was an "old" one, the feature was not enabled by default back then.
 Now the database is completely impossible to recover as the backup are also encrypted. We effectively have lost 4 years worth of data give or take.
 I don't know what will happen to me yet, I know that my boss is pissed off, the CTO is pissed off, and I am pissed off at myself lol.
 How do you cope with those kind of situations ?
 Details : 
 Just giving some context as to why I deleted the fucking keyvault. It had a funny name (not standard at all), with only one key, the key had the name of a server that was deleted since 2020. Turns out the DBA used the same key to encrypt the server that replaced it. 
 As I was trying to clean up our Azure subscriptions, because we have tons of unused resources, I thought this one was safe to delete.
 I immediediatly enabled both soft delete and purge protection for all our keyvaults after this mistake.

 I need to emphasise that for the type of system we operate, there is absolutely no advantage to this. It just means someone will be looking over my shoulder at a screen, rather than me sharing it right to their laptop via {insert video call provider here}

 I have been tasked to figure out why our on-premise GPO Password Policy isn't synchronizing correctly towards the user who have been synced to Azure AD. 
 After having read countless blogs and Microsoft articles I've come to the conclusion that it's unfortunately NOT possible to synchronize the "ms-DS-User-Dont-Expire-Password" attribute to AAD.
 I know you can set the password to never expire for ALL users within the MS 365 Admin Center -> Security & Privacy tab.. But what if I only want specific user accounts to never expire? 
 So my question is rather, is it possible to somehow let on-premise AD handle the "password never expires" for Azure AD?

 I have a task to migrate a Windows 2012 file server to a new Windows 2022 server. Most of the old folders I've move to AWS S3 glacier, but I have about 10TB of used data to migrate.
 I've tried 2 robocopy scripts and they skip so many files and folders. I'm using a domain admin account, but I see "access denies" and "The requested operation could not be completed due to a file system limitation"
 Here are what I've tried
 ROBOCOPY "\\server123\folder" "E:\folder" /copy:DATSOU /mir /mt:16 /R:0 /W:0 /np /XD DfsrPrivate ".trashes" /log:"C:\Robocopy Scripts\server123.txt" /v 
 and 
 ROBOCOPY "\\server123\folder" "E:\Newcastle" /mt:16 /E /ZB /XD DfsrPrivate ".trashes" ".TemporaryItems" /PURGE /COPYALL /b /R:0 /W:0 /NP /log:"C:\Robocopy Scripts\server123.txt" /v 
 This is just one folder I tested with so it's quicker.
 https://i.imgur.com/7sTRMTq.png
 It will be hard to give myself access to these millions of files as I'm sure that will cause issues, is there a robocopy method that will copy/mirror the source and copy to the destination and not worry about access permissions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Was wondering about MLAG configuration on Mellanox HPE switches.
 So I have two firewalls and two switches, they will be configured as MLAG.
 I found documentation on how to configure the MLAG: 
 https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/article/how-to-configure-mlag-on-mellanox-switches
 One thing I noticed is that the IPL link between the switches (I think IPL is equivalent to vPC in the Nexus world, but please correct me if I’m wrong) is that they do not trunk the traffic between the switches compared to Nexus switches. Here is a direct link to IPL configuration: https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/article/how-to-configure-mlag-on-mellanox-switches#jive_content_id_IPL
 Why is that? In the documentation, for IPL, it says that all: “All VLANs are open on this port. There is no need to configure that, as once an interface is mapped as IPL all the VLANs are open on this port”. 
 Does that mean that it is already a trunk port between switches that run IPL and there is no need for me to trunk the port-channel between the switches?
 This is my first time ever have my hands on with Mellanox switches, so I’m a little bit unsure how this really works. 
 Appreciate all your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently went into semi-retirement and moved from a consulting gig to a public college.
 I say "semi-retirement" because wow, the private and public sectors are crazy different. I took the huge pay hit, but started working somewhere really close to home, with a bunch of folks I like, and suddenly have people actually respecting my time off, be it a day or just after 5pm.
 I went from 60-80 hours a week and a big salary (not counting bonuses, SPIFs, and commissions) to making about half, but having more paid time off than I've ever had.
 I'm home at 5:05pm. Every night. Earlier if I jog.
 I drive my youngest kid to school in the morning, and pick them up after. My wife and I carpool again.
 I damn near killed myself for a lot of years, but I have savings for my youngest, and the others have finished their schooling.
 So, I quit the consulting in the Fortune 50 space and went to work at my local "podunk" school.
 Best decision ever.
 I took today off, and was invited to an important meeting by very high up folks.
 In my old life, I would have had to (at the least) find a way to call into the meeting.
 Today? Today they apologized for interrupting my time off. They put the notes from the meeting on my desk to review. 
 My direct supervisor texted and sent a Teams message telling me not to worry about the meeting.
 I feel like I'm in Europe. Yeah, the pay sucks, but the benefits are amazing. Medical is covered. Stupid low co-pays. Pension is set.
 I wish I could have done this sooner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is running phishing simulations (via third party) and every time a user clicks on a simulation link, we receive a high severity alert in our O365 console. The alert is obviously a false positive and states "A high-severity alert has been triggered. A potentially malicious URL click was detected".
 Screenshot of the alert: https://i.imgur.com/2A3BOBl.png
 A description of the alert states:
  
Generates an alert when a user protected by Safe Links in your organization clicks a malicious link. This alert is generated when a user clicks on a link and this event triggers a URL verdict change identification by Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It also checks for any clicks in the past 48 hours from the time the malicious URL verdict is identified, and generates alerts for the clicks that happened in the 48-hour timeframe for that malicious link. This alert automatically triggers automated investigation and response in Office 365. For more information on events that trigger this alert, see Set up Safe Links policies. 
  
We've configured Safe Links to bypass the domains and IP's of the phishing simulations but the alert still triggers. We are wondering if there is a way to bypass this alert for our simulations, but not our regular emails. It's a default policy under threat management alert policies so it cannot be edited. 
 Any assistance is appreciated.

 We have an old Netapp, it's end of life this month -- NetApp won't sell us a support contract.
 We're migrating away from NetApp to Azure, and while doing so, we stepped in it big..
 Client had not updated their domain controllers in several years, since before the kerberos/schannel changes in 2021
 After we updated domain controllers by applying windows updates, CIFS broke on our netapp ONTAP 8 units
 ​
 We've spent 3 days working without any help from Netapp -- i put in a pleading call to their sales with amex in hand asking for any sort of assistance to get this system online long enough for us to migrate away from it.
 ​
 I'm right now facing an issue regarding CIFS & netlogon 0xc000022
 Vfiler unable to authenticate due to denied access to CIFS server machine account in Active Directory - NetApp Knowledge Base 
 ​
 I think I get the gist of the article, thanks to the community forms that I do have access to.. "delete and recreate the AD account" -- and I think i know how to do this -- but I'd love to read the full article to see if any additional steps are required.
 ​
 I'll save my growing rant regarding paywalled kb articles for later..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, we're only including the Upstream device Hostname and the word "Uplink" <HOSTNAME> Uplink in our Interface descriptions. But I've been thinking about expanding this to include more L1 Information that easily gets lost in Diagrams and Spreadsheets.
 Some ideas:
  
Fibre patch lead connector type (e.g. lc/sc)
 Fibre patch lead tip (APC/UPC) [Optional, default would be UPC]
 Patch lead length (e.g. 3m)
 Horizontal Fibre type (e.g. om3, os2)
 Patch Panel location (e.g. <RACKID>-#RU)
  
The description would look something like this:
 <hostname> Uplink - pl=lc-sc-om4, tip=upc-upc, len=3m, hz=om3, loc=BB1-RU21 
 From the above, I can quickly tell that there is a 3m LC/SC OM4 UPC patch lead connected from $this device to BB1-RU21 which is a Horizontal run of OM3. 
 This could also be collapsed into a shorter form like:
 <hostname> Uplink - pl=lc-sc-upc-upc-3m-om4, hz=om3, loc=BB1-RU21 
 Does anyone think this is overloading the description of an Interface with excessive L1 Information? Should we be pulling this out into something like Netbox (We currently have no roadmap for Netbox). Or should be collapsed down into a Link ID and stored outside of the device configuration?
 Benefits I see:
  
Information is close to the hardware, less likely chance of being sprawled into Documentation that doesn't get an update
 
This information is presented directly in our alerts when the link goes down
 
No need to bring multiple different Patch-Leads to a job if the link goes down. Correct leads and connectors, each time.
 
 If you're doing this, would you mind sharing your standard?

Device on 0/1 is sending unregistered multicast traffic at IP 224.0.0.200 with a destination MAC of 01:00:5e:00:00:c8. Device on 0/2 can not see the multicast traffic. Is there a way with Catalyst switches to allow unregistered multicast to flood, or at least specify it to be allowed to go to 0/2?
 Steps I took
  
Disabled IGMG snooping globally on the switch
 Enabled IGMP snooping, and enabled the igmp querier
  
When I connect the devices to another switch of a different manufacturer, with the correct config, it works without issue.
 This solution might be similar on how to get mDNS to work correctly on a Catalyst 3750.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope this helps someone, we have been running down this very very frustrating path for awhile now. At first I did not believe it was isolated to the new machines our support team was deploying (Latitude 3310) but we have confirmed that to be the case.
 Issue: Users were reporting that during the day Outlook would become disconnected and refuse to re-establish connectivity without rebooting the device. Teams would also have similar issues. A reboot "fixed" it for a couple hours. In the AAD logs token refreshes were failing with server/proxy couldn't be found, so I was tracking that down believing it to be related.
 Resolution: I was in the office for the first time in awhile and went to one of our employees reporting this issue as well. I noticed his CPU fan was running non stop, and that really irritates me, so I found the service consuming it which ended up being part of the Dell Optimizer suite. This is "Intelligent AI-based features automatically fine-tune your PC for the best possible connection, audio and performance." NOPE, it sure isn't.
 Dell has a feature called "Express Connect" which seems to try and do some QoS style shaping but in real world simply causes nothing but issues. After uninstalling Dell Optimizer and its service (you need to do both) these issues have disappeared.
 TL;DR: Dell Optimizer does nothing to optimize and in fact causes issues that you'll be pulling your hair out on for awhile. Uninstall it and its service.
 ​
 Edit: After KNOWING the issue was Dell Optimizer I am able to locate countless reddit posts about the issue. I almost feel like we need some sort of KB of known trash. We don't reimage these because they are Intune/Autopilot machines going to random sites.

ISP tells us that two 1Gb connections will be significantly more affordable than the single 2Gb connection they offer. This initially seemed great because we have 1 group of traffic we want to use one of the connections and 1 group of traffic we want to use the other connection. ISP is using GPON and I suspect they will give me an IP address for the second connection that is in the same subnet as the IP for the first connection and thus would have the same gateway. Most PBR scenarios I've seen set the next-hop IP based on the source network, but in this case the next-hop IP would be the same for both connections. Firewall at school is an ASA 5516-X. I initially preferred to use just a single firewall, but I do have some extra 5506-X I could deploy if necessary, recognizing the 5506-X won't do the full 1Gb. I'm not completely familiar with GPON, but perhaps I could request the second connection have an IP in a different subnet? 
 Thinking a bit further, the school ASA in question currently has a VPN tunnel back to the datacenter ASA. I assume the school ASA is not going to establish a VPN tunnel to the datacenter from both of its IP Addresses, so I assume this is where a default route would come in and all traffic from both school subnets that need to traverse VPN tunnel would use the default route?

When I set these up I didn't configure anything special, they just worked. Was in the config looking to clean some old port channels up and was wondering if I needed anything else in here for the AP ports. 
 This is all on a single default vlan, nothing else special. What should I be putting on these ports config wise if anything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the near future I will get the task to renew the network hardware in the data center. So far we have two N5k with four N2k each as fabric extender in use. The two N5k are configured as vPc peers. Virtual machines and servers are connected with vpc to two different fabric extenders each, in order to create a failsafe and to be able to perform ISSU updates without interruption.
 We plan to replace the N5k with slightly "larger" Nexus 9300 and the N2K with slightly "smaller" Nexus 9300 as fabric extenders.
 Now there are three possibilities from my point of view:
  
 ⁠Rebuild the current design(Fex mode)
  
8 N9k 9300 are driven in FEX mode (like it’s described here https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/fex/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-2000-nx-os-fabric-extender-configuration-guide-for-nexus-9000-switches-93x/m-software-fex-mode-configuration.html) . 
 Two 9300 form a vpc domain and each of the two gets four fabric extenders assigned.
  
new topology: collapsed core (all standalone with back to back vpc)
  
2.1 Layer 2 only with back to back vpc 
 The two slightly larger 9300 models form the core layer (N9K_1 + N9K_2 )vpc domain 1 ).
 The access layer consists of 9300 pairs (N9K_3/4/5/6 + N9K_7/8/9/10 = vpc domain 2,3,4,5). These 4 pairs are then bound to the core layer with vpc.
 So every Access pair has a uplink to N9K_1 and one uplink to N9K_2
 2.2 layer 3 HSRP at aggression vpc connected with always 2 pair of Switches in VPC as access to keep up the portchannels on two switches for servers. 
  
VXLAN spine and leaf 
  
Maybe there are some more possibilities, then please tell me. What would you choose?

 The way I assume its done is by creating a vlan per room and adding a TV per vlan. On the wifi part configuring radius authentication and assigning different passwords for the different vlans, so when a client authenticates he ends up in the proper vlan.
 The thing is that this doesn't really seem very scalable to me. For small properties it seems manageable, but considering that there are hotels with 500+ rooms it seems little excessive to configure 500+ vlans across every switch (because of wifi roaming).
 What am I missing or this is the way it is done?

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring organizations”) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders about malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software—ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk—which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey /r/sysadmin,
 I've built a little cron editing tool with support for multiple crons.
 👉 https://tool.crontap.com/cronjob-debugger/multiple.
 For those of us still writing cronjobs I hope this can come in handy. I write them infrequent enough to not be able to visualise a few jobs at a time in my head.
 CronTool has been built together with the Reddit r/programmer community and it got a few novel features that (to my knowledge) you can't find anywhere else. To start, there's a view that allows you to visualise multiple cron jobs - or if you wish: your entire crontab file on a calendar!
 Many of the common crons need 2 or more cron jobs defined, for example:
 Run a cron at two different set times. e.g. I want a cron to run twice daily, at 8:30am and 11:30pm:
 30 8 * * * 30 23 * * * 
 (link)
 Run a cron every 15 minutes throughout the day except at 3AM:
 */15 0-2,4-23 * * * 15-45/15 3 * * * 
 (link)
 There is finally a good way to have an overview other those and I hope you'll find this useful too.
 Compared to existing online cron job editor, there are a few things this one can do:
  
✅ (obviously) calendar view
 ✅ support for L, W & LW values
 ✅ optional support for seconds & years
 ✅ support for the ? value
 ✅ support for the # value
 ✅ more help & documentation for first timers. Q/A with examples that need multiple crons, for example this one
 ✅ support for debugging multiple crons at once (see above)
  
Thanks for reading!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Currently, I have the need for an edge BGP Gateway, to peer with our 3 ISPs. Each provider has a 10 Gbps capacity, and are received on a switch, on SFP+ ports, except one of them that is connected to a QSFP+ port. For the BGP peering, will only accept a default route from each of the providers, i.e., we're not interested in Full-BGP support, the BGP peerings are there so that we can send a couple of IPv4 and IPv6 routes. For internal routing, we have an OSPF networtk with a routing table with about 7000 routes at the backbone.
 The thing is, our Mikrotik CCR1072 edge router is not scaling well, and we're planning on getting much more bandwidth on a couple of months. The current throughput is around 15 Gbps, and we're estimating that we will double it before july. 
 I'm thinking of getting a L3 Switch with 40G/100G uplink that could connect to the edge switch, and manage the 3 peerings on this new switch (as a BGP edge router), so it will also handle the traffic. What L3 switch would you guys you recommend? I'd like a switch that could handle, say, 80 Gbps of routing? Considering the 3 peerings, and the 7000 OSPF routes.
 We're also evaluating buying a new router, but Cisco and Juniper routers are basically too expensive right now, and checking out FS.COM I saw a couple of switches that could probably do the job, like this bare metal switch https://www.fs.com/products/69226.html. 
 Do you have any recommendations at a $10k-$15k budget?

 Just tried out an internet connect with 2Gbe speeds, but realized all my switching was 1gb only.
 SFP is fine for backbone links, but lots of my devices support 2.5gbe, so considering that as an option. So far it looks stupidly expensive though, like $120 for a 5 port unmanaged switch. Wondering if I'm missing something.....

 I´m sorry for my bad English. I from Argentina and I'm learning the language
 I work in a hospital in the area of ​​networking and it is my first job in that position. 
 I recently learned about Networking and put together a simple installation. IPS, Routers and Switches. In a room, on the first floor, place the Router (Mikrotik) together with the Provider's Modem and a main Giga SWITCH. 
 For each floor, there is a Switch inside a rack that is fed by a network cable to the Main Switch (First floor). Everything works correctly but I wanted to know if you can answer some questions so as not to make mistakes and learn from you: 
 ​
  
Is it always better if there are fewer Switches? 
 Is it better to use more wiring and do without Switches? 
 The more equipment in the middle, I understand that more failures could be generated in the network. this is so?

 I want to run a software which I don't trust too much.
 For that purpose I've set-up an Ubuntu machine using VM Workstation Player, while my host machine is running Windows 10.
 What worries me is that the software requires internet connection.
 Now, on the VM side I've set it to connect to a virtual network that was automatically created called VMnet8 (NAT).
 I've tried looking up ways to isolate the network further, but it seems that it's too complex.
 Are my network and host safe with the current configuration?
 Thank you for taking the time to help me here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello sysadmins, junior admin here,
 The company i'm working for wants to have every user registered to for MFA. Around 300 users. Company made the choice to also push toward Windows Hello (since we mainly use laptops and one per user). We have hybrid azure with on-prem ad, laptops are not yet Intune enrolled but are azure ad joined. Windows hello tested and it works. Also company don't want to "force" user to use personnal phone (app/number) so we plan to use TAP when users don't want to.
 We planned to help user enable windows hello using TAP/sms/app. Conditional access wil not ask for MFA when on premise (by ip) so it would be only when accessing cloud apps from home.
 But when i test it with windows hello enabled, when challenged for mfa, i can't chose windows hello as a method, Microsoft asks for me to register a MFA method (and redirect me to only authenticator app which annoys me since users can't chose SMS if they want)
 Any idea or best practice on how to achieve that ? Thank you, sorry if my english is a bit off

 I have the account password and previous password but not to the number linked to the account, which is crazy why a mobile number is forced rather than OTP. All account recovery options just fail because of this one single personal mobile number.
 Tried going through support reps and chats just to be told there's nothing they can do and to "just create a new one".. which means unenrolling every single Android device... Even though I can prove full tenant ownership, account ownership, can give or create proof of identity but nope. All the same crappy responses from the same script every single time.
 Does anyone know how in earth to speak to someone with a conscience at Google? It doesn't paint them in a good light if that's the only option and they can't help despite situations like these happen in business a lot. It's a shame there's not a question/rant flair!

The lazy part is creating a GPO "template" for the guest user, I was wondering if anyone had one that I could work from. The security/access level would be the same as a library or school.

A couple years ago I had to take an AWS training course for my school and came out with an associate level cert. Same for Palo. I have the certs but brain dumped most of it as I never ended up working with AWS or Palo in the real world.
 I’m not sure if I should put those certs on my resume. On one hand I want to show my future employer I have exposure to those technologies and a competence to learn AWS/Palo. On the other hand, I’m concerned i’ll be falsely advertising my skills and when in the interview it will be obvious those are “paper certs” that might bring into question my other qualifications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week a customer called me because <yesterday> they needed to install a brand new milling/grinding/IDK machine.
 The producer (german) gave them a form to fill with the network parameters for this brand new top of the line (way more expensive than a villa) machine. Filling the form I was skeptical.
 IP Address: <ok>
 Mask: <ok>
 Gateway: <ok>
 DNS: <ok>
 WINS: <what?>
 I thought of a "someone forgot to delete that row in a 20 years old document, maybe?" and I left that row blank.
 Fast forward to <yesterday>, I go to the customer and they were assembling a huge machine that does all sort of <I don't know, really, don't ask me.. I have no idea, I only know they produce metal bits> things.
 And they really needed a WINS server to communicate with the software installed on the management server. They cannot connect by IP address, they cannot resolve names using DNS, they really needed a WINS server.
 Obviously the guy assembling and installing the machine knew EVERYTHING about <how to work with metals> and absolutely nothing about what an IP address is. He only knew "how to insert those parameters in this window".
 He gave me access to the operating system of the monitor controlling that machine. Windows CE 5.
 I had to install and configure (well, only one record) a WINS server... in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had my first real life encounter with the 2038 bug this week. The situation was caused by a program we have that queries a domain registration API based on expiration date ranges. I had set it to query up to 15 years in the future (even though I know domains can only be registered up to 10 years in the future ... I wrote this thing 20 years ago so I don't remember why I added the extra 5).
 Anyway, 15 years from Jan 23, 2023 (calculated naively as 15 * 365) is Jan 19, 2038. So starting yesterday my query was breaking the API (internal error). The owners of the API identified the problem pretty quickly and confirmed it's the 2038 problem. I changed to query only 10 years in the future and they've now got 5 years to fix it
 I suspect we'll start seeing more of these random discoveries every January, with spikes in 2028 and 2033. Hopefully I'm right in thinking most of the problem code will just get naturally replaced in the next 15 years, but I know I've got a couple of old databases in production that will have to be fixed before then.

Oh, and encrypted backups from some of those services- *and an encryption key for some of said backups*
 And MFA for some clients for other offerings .
 If the original breach wasn’t enough to get you and your org off any GoTo products , then I would hope this is it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm only in my first year of being a sysadmin but I want to take steps towards a job that doesn't require me to wake up in the middle of the night. To me, sleep is worth more than any amount of money. I was thinking of some pathways.
  
Cyber Security: there seems to be a lot of job openings and remote too, but I hear they can have a lot of overtime. I don't mind overtime that much though.
 
DevOps: I feel like most of these positions are the same just better paid with some scripting.
 
Network Enginner: nope. I think they have it worse than me tbh. but yet again idk
 
System Engineer: Seems like basically a sr. sysadmin that implements stuff. they have the same on call bs 
 
SWE: idk I hear mixed things about it. I wouldn't really know where to start either. I was majoring in CS but I dropped out due to receiving my current position. my local schools hate ppl who work full time.
 
Cloud Engineer/Admin: same thing but cloud version. I guess I can get remote work with this at least.
 
 I was planning on going to WGU to finish my degree. Maybe I should just become a farmer. tbh my job isn't that bad but I just can't deal with the on-call (one week a month) and 24/7/365 support aspect.
 any suggestions or advice is much appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today i was attemting to enroll a users computer into intune via the Company Portal. I kept getting an error that the user was already part of the organization, despite the company portal not registering them or appearing in Endpoint manager.
 Well here's where the fucked part comes in...
 I broke the cardinal rule of make a backup before you make changes. 
 I deregistered the user from their AzureAD thinking they'd automatically re-join. But no I ended up locking them out.
 In my attempt to recover their files I realized that the BitLockercker key was never stored in Azure or their Microsoft "My Account" Page. 
 That's when it settled in that I really fucked up.
 My only option was to nuke their computer and hope they had backed up everything to Google Drive or OneDrive. But low and behold they didn't. It's company policy for them to store all their files in google drive and not store any files locally. Still I feel that I really fucked up and I spent 6 hours trying to recover their files and ended up nuking their machine.
 But lesson learned. Don't run dangerous commands on a users machine, and make sure all their files are saved in the cloud if I do have to run dangerous commands.
 I really hope I don't get fired. But I am submitting an Incident report tomorrow morning to the CEO, Co-Founder, and VP (users boss). Let's hope I don't get fucked too bad. All I got to say is there goes my bonus and raise...
 I'm also going to use this as an opportunity to implement better policy and training material so that the users are aware of the risks of saving data locally. If they had lost their computer they would have been in the same situation.

 We have a manufacturing facility that deals a lot with sand castings so there is a ton of really fine silica sand that gets everywhere. These din Rail Switches usually go inside a machine box that doesn't have the greatest filtration and will be exposed to quite a bit of dust/fine sand not to mention in summer months some pretty hot temperatures as we are are dealing with molten metal, furnaces, etc etc in a factory environment. 
 If anyone has experience with what I'm looking for please let me know what your go to is.

 I have an issue with a user not being able to save documents in any network locations
 Issue occurs when creating a brand new black document and going to save it to the file server https://imgur.com/a/sM7Fq1G (Doesnt matter what folder they choose, same error occurs)
 Same thing occurs if opening a document on the file server and editing/saving
 I have done the following
  
Unmapped/Remapped Network Drives
 DisableRobustifiedUNC Via Registry
 Reinstalled Office
 Checked permissions on file server
 Checked Security Groups
  
Nothing I do is allowing them to save. Suprisingly if he logs into the RDS Server with the same AD Account, the issue is not there and they can save/edit excel files on the file server without issues
 I haven't attempted to create a new AD account yet but that will be the last resort
 Does anyone have any ideas? Havent had any luck with reccomendations from forums n the like so here I am
 Thanks

I've heard this time and again, and still haven't found a good explanation, "In CLOS-style, leaf-spine topology, you wouldn't need expensive/high-end modular/chassis based switch to work as a spine, you could just put one of the plug-in/fixed-form-factor inexpensive switches to act as spine as they wont need to have all the routes installed in their hardware/TCAM table". While I understand the logic behind the spines not having to need to install all the routes in their hardware (for example, with EVPN, they would just need to save the next-hop leaf destination ), what does 'chassis-based vs fixed-form-factor' argument mean?

 No but seriously fun times.
 A customer is still using an MS-DOS based property management and accounting software. It runs on a pair of Pentium IV computers running Windows XP. Since XP has native DOS emulation, it's the latest version of Windows that will work. Both computers have a crossover cable connecting them with static IP addresses set, so offline and airgapped.
 The customer reached out to me because their HP LaserJet 1160 was having problems and they couldn't get anyone to work on it. They wanted a printer to replace it with, but wanted one with an LPT port. Long story short, I couldn't find any of those handy, but was able to get things working with a USB printer. Enter the Brother HL-L2300D. A USB-only printer that still has Windows XP drivers listed on Brother's website.
 Plug that guy in, install the drivers, share it, and then run
  
net use lpt2: "\hostname\BrotherP" /persistent:yes
  
Then I went into the DOS program and pointed print jobs to LPT2 instead of LPT1. Had to change the print processor from RAW to TEXT to get it printing, but print it did!
 It's not every day I get to work on something this old, and normally I just say "nah" to unsupported stuff like this. But it works... they have a hot/warm spare running, and don't need support from the vendor. So why not? I got them running and made them happy, and collected my check. Good times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading into some BT supplier notes and have come across their managed broadband. The whole connection is their responsibility up until the communications provider (CP). 
 PPP sessions are forwarded to the CP. At this point they say, it is the responsibility of "the CP to terminate these PPP sessions and assign an IP address to the session". 
 I'm not familiar with this process and would like to know:
  
Is this a complex thing to do? 
 Or is it abstracted away?
 
 Where can I find more info about this process?
  
Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!

 No default IP address for VLAN1 on these switches. Must connect via console first and assign one.
  
I have been given some old AT-8000s switches to play with; all factory reset to defaults.
 The unhelpful manual simply says "Enter the device IP address in the address bar and press <Enter>" without ever specifying what the default device IP address is.
 Does anyone know?

The vendor is Verizon and they've come in and installed their circuit demarc gear (ciena 3903) and dropped me off a Cisco Meraki router that the tech did not install and said it was up to us to install it. Verizon also provided me with a /30 WAN CIDR with one IP being Verizon's IP and one being my IP.
 My question is: do I really need to install their router for this installation? can i not just wire myself straight from the NID device to my palo alto firewall and just give the interface the IP information they supplied me, using the Verizon IP as the gateway? or am i missing something crucial here that I need their router for? 
 Thanks for any insight

 ​
 My GPO to push the 802.11 profile is set to auto-connect after-login and perform SSO with domain-creds. My concern is that because these PCs won't be connected before-login GPO won't process properly during login.
 Am I correct in this or will it connect immediately after login and then perform policy updates after? Should I explore machine-based auth and have it connect before login? 
 ​
 I was hoping to use machine-based auth for initial connectivity for domain-level services (SMB, RPC, Kerberos, LDAP, etc) and then user-based auth after login for full access - Just not having any luck on identifying if it is even possible. (Similar to machine-based auth for a VPN which gets you connected to the domain and then user-level auth to obtain access to all other resources)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a VLAN dedicated for equipment supplied by outside vendors that need internet access. All endpoints on this VLAN will be a device that will connect a VPN back to it's individual vendors home office to give them remote management access. 
 Most of these devices come with a fairly well documented list of access requirements for the VPN to function. Meaning that the vendor has provided all the information needed to lock down the connection. This is great! But, to me, it is kind of silly to go to all the trouble of locking down 90% of these appliances if the other 10% are not well secured, get compromised, and end up allowing open access to everything else on that layer2 subnet. 
 I already have the vlan/subnet locked down so that it has zero access to the internal network. But I would like to take it a step further by locking down layer2 communication in that vlan/subnet so that each endpoint can only communicate with the gateway (fortinet 80f) and outside internet. 
 Rough breakdown of my hardware in place it as follows:
 Internet > Fortigate 80f > mdf-access - Cisco 3850 > core-switch - Cisco Nexus 3548P > idf-access - Cisco 3850 > Vendor Endpoints
 Internal network gateways live on the nexus 3548p which also handles the internal routing.
 Guest and isolated vlan/subnet gateways live on the fortigate. No routing other than sending traffic to the internet. On the switches, there is just the layer2 vlan configured, no layer3 svi. 
 So, is configuring private vlans my best bet here? https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/a-quick-summarized-view-to-private-vlan-pvlan-x
 Or is there a better way to isolate layer2 endpoints? Am I overthinking this?
 Also, let me know if I left out any information that would be useful for a recommendation.

 Thank you for any thoughts or advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question for anyone who used NSO with CARE to automate STIGs.
 So we had call yesterday with a few guys from Cisco to discuss us potentially ordering Cisco NSO. The main reason for purchasing is to use their CARE product which will allow us to automate STIG checking and filling out the STIG checklists for us, among other things.
 During this meeting the guy referenced anislble alot and said that NSO using a lot of ansible playbooks to do these checks. Even when he showed us the output of some of the checks, i noticed that it is the same output that I would get from ansible. Everything from what it prints down to even the color it prints in.
 So my question. Everything that NSO CARE does for checking STIGS (compliance checks, differences between golden configs and all other configs, filling out STIG checklists, etc.), could it all be done with ansible playbooks? I have some experience with ansible and python, and I have my own playbooks/scripts that do compliance checks, check differences between configs, tell me what STIG findings are open, etc. The only thing I really havn't figured out how to do yet that I really would like to be able to do is automate filling out the checklists. Not sure if thats possible with an ansible playbook or not.
 TLDR: Is Cisco NSO with CARE worth the cost, or can I just do everything with Ansible?

 "Importantly, management should also take the opportunity to address excessive employee compensation. The median salary at Alphabet in 2021 amounted to nearly $300,000, and the average salary is much higher. Competition for talent in the technology industry has fallen significantly allowing Alphabet to materially reduce compensation per employee. In particular, Alphabet should limit stock-based compensation given the depressed share price."
 This is all about reminding employees who is in charge. All those worker gains in the last three years, yeah, we need to roll those back. Can't have the plebs getting uppity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am working on a project right now and there is a change in ip address space of the ISP, they are moving from x.x.x.0/24 (old address space) address to y.y.y.0/24 (new address space). Both ranges are currently rout'able through the existing gateways but after the end of this week only y.y.y.0/24 will be available for us to use.
 The current problem we are facing is that we already setup everything in y.y.y.0/24 address space in advance (interface, gateway, nat, security policy etc), but there seems to be some issue with NAT overload (trusted to untrusted) rules and we are seeing the issues mostly with SIP and RTP traffic. The issue is that even if we have configured ip y.y.y.y on the untrusted/outside interface and have a NAT rule for outbound traffic (to use interface), the firewall is taking the old ip configured on the outside interface (x.x.x.x). Not sure why it's behaving like this for SIP and RTP but most of the other traffic is using the new IP (y.y.y.y). 
 We verified if the traffic is hitting the correct policy using test and it's hitting the correct NAT rule and shows the correct translated address. But checking the active sessions using the show session commands shows it's not using the current interface ip but the old ip of the interface. We verified the output of the show session against the corresonding NAT rule and we can see the SIP/RTP sessions under that rule but using old ip as a translated source address.
 The firewall is on 8.1 version and upgrading is not an option right now as we are in a process of migrating the firewalls. Tried clearing the sessions, removing and re-adding the NAT rule, but this buggy behaviour exist. Should I disable SIP ALG/inspection and allow traffic through security policy?
 Apologies for the long post and any help is really appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a bit stumped on this. I have a 6tb volume on a Powervault MD3600i filled with mixed data. Two Windows 2012r2 servers are connected to it forming a failover cluster for a file server role. This has been fine for years, but now the role fails to bring the volume online due to a 'thread exit or application request'. I believe this is actually timing out:
 Having removed the disk from the cluster entirely, if I try to bring it online on one of the hosts directly, it takes a long time - 30 minutes+ while disk management is locked up. But you can see constant data being read on the iscsi interfaces before it randomly mounts. The data continues to be read but at this point you can browse the data etc. It's like it's scanning the entire content of the volume. 
 I can't figure out why this has started happening - it's the same on both hosts, plus another unrelated server I've mounted it on. I guess the issue is the volume, but once it's mounted everything seems okay with the data, and other volumes on other servers from the same MS3600i are cracking on with life. 
 Any ideas appreciated - I am perplexed.

 ​
 I'm at a loss here and maybe you can help. 
 ​
 I have a Logitech MX Master connected via BT to my PC. OS is Win10 Pro Build 19044. I'm using a third party BT Stick that works for all other peripherals I connect perfectly fine and did so for the mouse too - just to clarify it shouldnt be the stick imo. 
 ​
 The issue is the following: 
 ​
 Sometimes (I cant reproduce) the cursor freezes and I cant use the mouse anymore. Mouse is fully charged. To get the cursor moving again I need to either open - if it isnt already - the Bluetooth settings of Windows or if it is already open close it. This seems to reset a driver or wake a suspended driver or device. All movement and clicks the physical mouse performed while it wasnt working in Windows will then be carried out as if queued for later execution. 
 ​
 I cant find an option to disable energy saving and this just started a few weeks ago. Unfortunately I do not recall if it started after an update.
 ​
 ​
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

 ​
 2 - if I doing this process during working hours will it break authentication ?

 3 - I have ran the "Check-11Bissues.ps1" script from GitHub to do some prelim investigations. I am getting an warning related to the AZUREADSSOACC computer account.

 There are 1 objects that do not have msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes configured or is set to zero. When authenticating to this target, Kerberos will use the DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes registry value on the authenticating DC to determinte supported etypes. If the registry value is not configured, the default value is 0x27, which means 'use AES for session keys and RC4 for ticket encryption' - If this target server does not support AES, you must set msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes to 4 on this object so that only RC4 is used. (Please consider working with your vendor to upgrade or configure this server to support AES. Using RC4 is not recommended) - If this target server does not support RC4, or you have disabled RC4 on DCs, please set DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes on DCs to 0x18 or msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes on this object to 0x18 to specify that AES must be used. The target server must support AES in this case. Here are the objects that do not have msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes configured CN=AZUREADSSOACC,OU=Server,DC=contoso,DC=local

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 i just wanted to know what are the best practices for setting up a windows 10 image or .wim file and deploying that as efficient as possible for a small business of 25 users and little ressources. Im just asking because I'm curious if there are other better ways. I came from a company which had 3000 Users and we used Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for creating images and deploying them to specific PCs over ethernet.
 Right now at my new company this is not an option as it would be completely overkill for a small business and cost way too much. What I did instead is set up a virtual machine with windows 10 on my local computer, configure some local policies, install some software and create an image which I then deploy by using usb-sticks and using sample scripts from microsoft for formatting and applying the image. But is this really the best method? What I have to do for every PC after applying the image is updating everything, doing a domain or adding missing drivers which drives me nuts sometimes because sometimes the PC has network problems because of missing drivers, which I then have to add manually. 
 What I liked about Endpoint Configuration Manager was that you could automate all of these things. Drivers could be added to the task sequence and where loaded from a specific server which the PC connected to while applying the task sequence. Domain join and updates etc. where also all done while applying task sequence. What was left to do for the admin was just to check if everything worked after the PC finished and most of the time, it worked. Is there any similar, cheaper technology or method which can reach the same level of automation?

 I’ve spoke with Apple Support and got a vague “no not possible” answer, however, I feel like it might be, just the management would be on the Azure end.
 Essentially I’m working to get Apple Business Manager linked to Azure AD so we can take control of personal Apple IDs and reset passwords, etc. when users inevitably lock themselves out. 
 I’ve done most of the leg work and am now at the point of hitting enable…Speaking to Apple support, I explained that our end goal is to run this as a phased roll out slowly adding users and taking over their Apple ID, the support team said it’s all or nothing and any existing Apple ID that conflict will essentially have 60 days to move information over to a different account before we take control. 
 Is this really the case? Could I limit who/what the enterprise app can see so we can add users a batch at a time?

A third party is doing the actual migration and has carried out a pilot migration which has brought some issues to light, the biggest being that not everything has been migrated over. 
 Speaking to the third party we have established that they’re using ‘MigrationWiz’ to do the migration and in the help materials they specifically mention that some items are not migrated:
  
Calendar notifications
 Items that do not match folder types
 Bounce notifications
 etc
  
We are looking for a way to count the items in user mailboxes, excluding the ones that are not migrated so that we can verify what has moved over. I have found the PS cmdlets ‘Get-MailboxFolderStatistics’ and ‘Get-MailboxStatistics’ but neither really do what we need, has anyone done this before/got any suggestions on how we can verify what has migrated please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm working with Cisco and Arista VXLAN Fabrics. We usually build them for small and midsize enterprises. Sometimes bigger ones. For me, most DCs have around 50 switches. 
 But, after everything is finished and we take a look in the EVPN table, we find that they can get pretty big. Sadly most customers want "every vlan everywhere!!!11" which certainly won't help with scalability. As we have to add a VLAN to 50 switches, even if it's only used on 2 switches. 
 After we did dig a bit in scalability and how to minimize table entries (depending on BGP design obviously). We are not sure how big someone could scale a standard VXLAN EVPN Fabric. Someone told me "around 400 switchs, then it gets janky" another one said "we have 2000 switches in a campus VXLAN EVPN fabric, everything is fine". So, how far can we/you go? What are the limits?
 I'm not talking about the routing table of the switches, of course some switches will fill their tables earlier than others. But if you use switches with millions of possible entieries, where is the limit?
 I know already that the public clouds don't use a DC network like the ones we build. They have "software" on their servers for their fabric and don't have all that state in their network. It wouldn't scale that big.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 due to a new project we got a new password manager. Now we need to protect this data. 
 Now the data protection department came and said that it is very common in IT to separate "account information" (UserName and Password) and "access information" (IP address, DomainName) and store them in different systems.
 Plan would be the following 
 Account information -> PasswordManager
 Access information -> Tool X 
 The plan is then that the colleagues can look up the access information via Tool X for example "Greensystem has IP XX.XXX.XXX" and then search for the account information in the PasswordManager. Title: Greensystem, UserName "Test", Password: "123456"
 I am a big friend of security but have never heard this procedure of information storage and find the whole thing for colleagues who access 5-15 times to any systems simply much too inefficient. I can imagine that colleagues will soon go crazy like this. 
 What is your experience with this? Do you have any comments here? Am I seeing this wrong or do I need to do some more convincing here?

 I am wondering how you solve this case in your organisation.
 We have a hybrid AD solution. So we have on-prem AD which is synced with O365. So we administrate the AD on-prem and it syncs it to O365.
 If a user is inactive we change OU and disable them. In O365 the user will stay active but the login will be blocked. If the user has a email forwarding address this will be active too.
 This behaviour is because if a user will be accidently moved (we have a script from our ERP) to disabled OU that not all will be deleted.
 In O365 there is no section like "disabled users" only "deleted users", or do I miss something?
 The unhappy thing is that the email forwarding will still be active.
 How you handle this all? Do you block email forwarding at all?
 If we would remove the email forwarding on every move to disable OU there would be a case if the user was accidently moved to that OU.

 ​
 Quick story: i'm currently working as a junior sysadmin at a small company with 70 employees for over 1 year. (this is my first IT job, i'm currently 22 years old)
 Me and my IT Manager manage all the servers, the whole network and offer support to our collegues. 
 The last few months do have been really boring for me as there has not been a lot of work. All the server run smooth and in a 40 hour work week I have like 10 hours of work so i'm really bored. I already tried studying but a person can only study a certain amount of hours per day... 
 Recently though I have had a really good offer on Linked with a big company in my local area. They got a Sysadmin team with more than 20 people. 
 For me this is a very good opportunity as they are prepared to learn me everything from scratch. So I won't be bored as there is a a lot of work. I will even get the oppurtunity to travel abroad with our sysadmin team to maintain the server park abroad. They even offer the ability to earn certificates. 
 Not only that, my pay and benefits will also increase significantly. 
 My problem is now that I feel guilty about turning in my resignation as my manager will be left alone to manage the whole IT infrastructure in my current company. 
 ​
 What is the best approach to this situation and how can I turn in my resignation professionally? 
 ​
 Many thanks & kind regards!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 5 years at a small full service MSP, where I started with absolutely 0% experience in IT, and have slowly moved to a supervisor position and had been in talks with the owner for me to take over the company when he retires, I just got an offer with a 20% increase in pay and full benefits. I still have one class left before I get my bachelors and no security clearance so I didn’t think I would qualify for many jobs in my area but it turns out my interviewing went better than I expected and I’m just so damn excited to take the next step in my career.
 Any advice for working in the government sector?

 My employees are great and I do every I can for them. And I know that my boss has my back, and even his boss. But I work for a megacorp… go far enough up and my name means nothing. I’m an employee ID number and an expense on some MBAs spreadsheet. 
 I’m not advocating that anyone do subpar work, but I’m also saying if you get a significantly better offer strongly consider it, because if the bean counters could clone you, and ship your clone to a lower cost of employment country and maintain the same level of productivity, there would be 3 of you doing your job from a foreign country right now.

What I mean by "dead man's switch" is a buried Powershell or Python script set to do something if the IT guy is suddenly fired or their account is disabled. Is this just a tall tale or a unicorn?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT is an AMAZING study tool but maybe it's affecting my google skills. 
 The response I'm getting for "what if you don't know the number of hops away when configuring" (as part of a larger ChatGPT "conversation") is: 
 "You can still configure BGP without knowing the exact number of hops. It's possible to use a 'default' number of hops in the configuration or use a wildcard to match any number of hops. You can also make use of path explored by using the BGP traceroute command." 
 I know that you can change the ttl value as needed but when you don't know the exact number, do you just estimate (and/or purposely overshoot it?). 
 I like the idea of using traceroute to count the number of hops but on the internet I think some points can be blocked from being counted in traceroute (or may just the ip is blocked but you can count the "*" instead). I also assume that if there is any AS prepending along the way this number could be off. 
 Specifically, do you, in practice, just type something like... 
  neighbor 192.52.100.2 remote-as 65555 neighbor 192.52.100.2 ebgp-multihop 255 
 and just hope that the neighbor's hop count away is within the max ttl value?

 I am running 6.2.9a. 
  
a cursory search shows this to be a bug in this software version, but I do not have access to download a newer version.
 is there any other workaround for this bug? 
 does a write erase actually blow away the license? It is a standard 12 port 16G license.

 I manage a crew of seasonal temps—25 people or so, (summer months) doing customer service work in the natural resource field at remote rural sites. Age range is class of $current_year to old boomers. 
 Part of their job is data collection--we use cheap android tablets for this. results are cached and uploaded when they get to a network.
 For many years we've just let them use their personal phone for work related stuff. I'll text them if there is a call out and I need to reassign their task, or if there is a tornado for instance. It's been fine for everyone except the past couple of years HR has been making noises expressing their worry about the BYOD. We had a retirement in my chain and now I've got the big seat. (Change happens when change happens) anywho, New year—new policy! For my part the personal phone thing freaks me out--the main ones are workplace stalking/creeping and also protecting my staff from having their personal property taken as evidence.
 ​
 What should we do?
 ideas so far--
 furnish each with a company iPhone and company iPad. phone is for contact, iPad is for data entry.
 Furnish each with an iPhone and use it for contact and collection. Con of this is old people and fat fingers/data entry/battery life.
 furnish each with an iPad (cellular) and use it for contact and data entry. Con is they don't have a work number. 
 I briefed my leadership and IT staff on this and they were both supportive of whatever proposal i make. My boss is an apple fanboy. We've got dollars in the budget to roll this out. 
 other useful things:
 org has 500 people on payroll and we all use office 365 in a Windows environment. 
 I'll have a breakfast burrito.

I understand that you or a colleague at <company> is doing some research on server backup technology! I would love to learn more about your role.
  
I've mentioned before that my email address is not published anywhere and I've never shared it with any platform with permission to send me marketing crap, much less share it with others for marketing.
 You can imagine my annoyance when I receive unsolicited email from people trying to sell me things.
 The part that bugs me is reading between the lines. They know *someone* at <company> is doing "research" but not who. That tells me they're using ZoomInfo (from which I'm opted out but I trust gas station egg salad more than them) or a similar platform to scavenge information from people who brush past their website. 
 And not knowing who, they decided to shotgun every address they have available for the company. 
 The truly shit part is that I replied to the message with the very concern I mentioned here and got a 550 error bounceback that tells me they block direct emails (there was a link to a calendar platform to schedule an appointment in the message, screw that). 
 Of course this is the level of bullshit I expect from SolarWinds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Past few years I’ve been learning python while working as mainly a voice engineer. I have experience automating things here and there. Some examples of the libraries I’ve been using are: zeep/soap related, pandas, paramiko, netmiko, and recently napalm. I’m curious what the current pulse is like though, and where I should be pivoting my efforts to learn? Is a network automation job worth the hop(personal experience)? Is network automation worth skipping into? Personal experience would be nice to hear.
 I now have a collection of no starch books I keep buying and am here and there working through them - for at least high level knowledge. I’d like to better prioritize what languages in general that are going to be the next thing when it comes to automation. I can see AI being a critical component to integrate more and more with network automation, but I’d think this landscape would be bottlenecked with baseline comparison API requests than a full AI automated network. I have some ideas to do this currently that involves a hacky method, but I think it could at least give a POC. I digress. I think though, this bring up the matter of how much should I invest in deep learning, machine learning, AI if I stay on the network automation track?

 The AP's will run in proxy mode since the wifi network is completely separate from the corporate network and thus "local mode" from AP direct to RADIUS server across the LAN is not possible. 
 would it be deemed secure enough to have a destination NAT on the firewall to a RADIUS server in the DMZ, providing only meraki dashboard IP's and RADIUS protocol were permitted to access it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone experienced Dell laptops not responding to DOT1X Auth? There seems to be an issue with select models that will authenticate as long as you are active. Remove the smart card and be gone so long that is naps and subsequently seems to ignore the switch trying to do DOT1X Auth. Eventually the Auth is failed and the MAC is removed from the switch.
 User returns to reinsert smart card, wakes screen to log in, but no network connectivity. User has to reboot to acquire network access again. 
 Not all users or Dell models have this issue. It is an enterprise network, but I am told only 1 site is affected. Hmm

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question for the community is what's the advantage to buying the overpriced drives and RAM from Dell when I can get equivalent hardware for much cheaper. I'd rather buy a couple of extra sticks of RAM and an extra NVMe as cold spares and save thousands, but am I missing some advantage or gotcha? The SKUs I'm looking at are:
 400-BKGI
 370-AEVP
 ​
 Thoughts/suggestions?
 EDIT: Yes this is for a production system for our organization but we do want to not spend needlessly; specifically 2 Linux KVM virtualization platforms which will be clustered. I've done something similar in the past about 10 years ago and it all worked just fine. It seems Dell has to cover the SKUs we are purchasing from them so it could be a good way to save money. Thanks for all of the replies so far.
 EDIT2: For contractual reasons, we need to buy Dell servers. Bleghhh. 
 EDIT3: Super helpful responses, everyone. Thanks! We are mulling our options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And just in general how typically fragmentation goes? Ofc TCP is stream, but realistically I feel there is no way client/server hello get sliced midway through, since they are rendered whole at once, so there is no time for TCP to slice. Also there is nothing in the TCP buffer that is waiting to be send when connection is open. 
 (zero rtt is not considered. assume message does not exceed TCP segment max size)
 Edit: En-route to work, will answer everyone in an hour or two. A lot of useful info! Thanks everyone
 Edit2: Thank you, everyone. Yeah, there is no reason not to buffer incoming messages. I think these suboptimizations are just not worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a situation where there are 2 routers where 2 different ISPs terminate. Each one advertises our BGP prefix. On the inside, however, it's just HSRP. Outbound traffic goes to the VIP. When one of the ISPs goes down, if that particular router happens to be the HSRP primary the internet will go down. I can restore it if I increase the priority on the other ISP router, but this is a manual intervention.
 Is there a better approach than this design or anything that can be done to improve it? As far as I'm aware, HSRP has no ability to do anything like route path monitoring.
 Thanks!

 I'm a bit confused here. I've done span from port to port but not to a remote IP. Would anyone be willing to shed some light on how to get this done? DO i just do SPAN and point it to the upstream palo alto/ firewall that is running netflow monitoring?

 In the FTP graph, why is there such a high change of the interarrival time being high? I understand that in TELNET the time is usually high because its interactive and the user takes time to type, but in FTP shouldnt the packets just be sent quickly one after another. If the interarrival is high doesnt it indicate congestion

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to configure a pair of firewalls running Vyos, gw01 and gw02. Each firewall has a ptp OSPF link to the edge router, edge-gw01.
 gw01 and gw02 are configured with vrrp for the LAN gateway addresses (6 subnets). 3 of those subnets have a stateful firewall, so conntrack-sync is configured between gw01 and gw02.
 My problem is that both gw01 and gw02 advertise the LAN subnets via OSPF to edge-gw01, but for the subnets with stateful fw, traffic must go to the current vrrp master. 
 What is the best way to ensure edge-gw01 only imports routes for the LAN subnets from the current VRRP primary?
 EDIT: The vyous routers each have a /31 to the edge router. If I do nothing, the edge router sees two equal cost routes to LAN subnets, so there’s even chance that external packets hit the vyos that’s in vrrp backup state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm experiencing a strange issue which doesn't let me work with 25G DAC cables.
 So, I have Dell R740xd server with the following Network Adapter:
 Broadcom BCM57414 NetXtreme-E 10Gb/25Gb RDMA Ethernet Controller ( dual port )
 I'm using the following DAC cables:
  
SFP-H25G-CU3M
 SFP-H10GB-CU3M
  
The switch is Cisco Nexus 9K.
 So, when you connect 2 cables of 10G to the dual port adapter, everything work just fine, and both ports have links.
 But, when you connect for example, 10G cable on one port and 25G cable on the other port, only the first cable that is connected will get link.
 same goes for two 25G cables. if you connect just 1 cable of 25G, the port works fine (alone).
 The network card is high profile if it's matter.
 we have tried to replace the network card to a brand new one, same issue.
 I checked with Dell, no hardware issues found. I checked with VMware, no software / configuration issues found.
 I didn't check with Cisco yet.. maybe there is some kind of limitations on the network adapter? am I missing something? the cables are not supported?
 Edit: After I limited the port using "speed 10000" the port came up, but as 10G.
 Thanks!!

 I believe that they do not have any other methods so far and I do not think they are trying to ban calling over Wi-Fi, and it is likely a side effect.
 However, even using a VPN to bypass the network restriction, calling over Wi-Fi still does not work. Why is that.?

 #2: Preventing data leaking is one thing, but I also want to prevent malicous USB attacks. I can set autorun bans, auto AV scans, but have you tried a forced formatting rule etc..? I know McAfee had such a feature, that it forced you to format the usb wether you wanted to use it.

Eg permission to connect only when the end user is in the specific domain, has a certificate from an internal certificate server or something similar?

 We are experiencing difficulty sending emails using certain email clients (such as Mail in MS Windows or Thunderbird) due to our email provider blocking certain regions. Our credentials and port settings are correct, but we are unable to send emails. We discovered that our region is currently blocked, but we were able to resolve the issue by submitting a ticket and getting our specific IP added to the provider's whitelist for our region. Is it possible to set up a relay or other solution to allow users outside the office to send emails?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I am still relatively new to the Azure Cloud and everytime I thinkt that I have an understanding, I learn that I don't understand anything at all. 
 For a small deployment I need to make a VM public. I know that I can simply use a public IP and it is done, but then I have a self administrated host exposed to the internet and that might not be the best idea. 
 Of course I could always use an Azure Firewall, but this is quite expensive and destroys the budget. Is there any way to have a small Internet Gateway which does the same as an Azure Firewall, but for small deployments?
 What about a load balancer, can I give it a public IP and use this one to NAT to my server?? Or is this a big security risk as well? 
 How do you do this in Azure?

 We currently give laptops out to emplyees without doing anything. When a laptop arrives, we start it once, so we go past the initial start-up, activate BitLocker, setup a simple PIN and give it to the emplyee. 
 The problems:
 Its very very hard to force the employees to use tools like KeePass for PW management or even our own WIKI. Also, I am worried about security. I am thinking about settings up an admin account and a user account, which cannot install anything. 
 How are these things usually handled in bigger companies?
 I would also like to hear how you force your employees to use the tools? How do you handle passwords?

 I have no idea, what I could do to solve my problem.
 In the company, I currently work for, there are several iPad users who want to access their personal folder (stored on windows file server), which is shared through a restricted access. 
 The end user has no permissions to see the content of the folder above, but the "own" one.
 Maybe it's a bit easier to understand, if I show you an example:
 \\SERVER\USERHOMES$\JOHNDOE
 None of the users can see, what's inside of USERHOMES$, but they can access their folder JOHNDOE with special permissions. 
 I've seen multiple threads that reported, that this kind of file sharing isn't possible through the native "Files"-app on iPad OS 16 or earlier.
 Do you guys have any idea?
 A third-party app would work, but we prefer to use native apps.
 ​
 Thanks in advance,
 Pacman

We have approved the firmware in WSUS and can see it in a state whereby it's ready to go. When checking for updates on the client side however nothing pulls through, however doing a 'check online for updates', the PC will happily draw the firmware down from the internet and install. Any thoughts on what else we can check server side for WSUS? The firmware versions on WSUS are identical to the ones the PC draws from the internet so it's a strange one.

 We are a somewhat small organization and are planning to buy a physical servers and use them as have VMWare vSphere 8 running on that with different VMs of Windows Server 2022 Standard.
 Regarding the HW Specs and application stack hosting
  
We are purchasing: CPU - 128 Cores
 We require: CPU - 78 Cores
  
The architecture requirement will be 3 production servers & 1 staging server
 Server 1 - 16 cores
 Server 2 - 8 cores 
 Server 3 - 32 cores
 (Staging) Server 4 - 32 cores
 Will we be able to spin up the VMs without having the proper coverage of licenses, I was informed by the deployment team that it only requires activating the server licenses with a single 2 Core license pack on each server VM and that we can still run the VMs without having the additional Server Core licenses purchased additionally. Would that be the case? As we are only buying 2 core license pack for a total of 16 cores of Windows Server 2022 Standard.
 *Disclaimer, I am not managing the server, I am advising on hardware purchasing/approval/compliance for the respective deployment team. This is my first instance of approving and not too sure on the Server Core licensing requirements. Of course compliance will be looked into, just wanted to know practically if what was mentioned above by deployment team is correct.
 Thanks

 Newly appointed IT Manager here. I'm a one man band coming to the end of several projects I managed over the last 6 months, including Intune MDM configuration / deployment, Cyber Essentials + accreditation, and an 80 page IT policy written from scratch... 
 I am now planning for the next 6 months. Does anyone have any advice on what you'd be doing off the back of the projects above? Any recommendations in terms of what I should be focusing on for the company? I'm considering getting a 3rd party in for some pen testing (customers often request evidence of this), researching and planning for ISO27001 (not sure if we're quite ready for this) and also looking at a device renewal scheme. 
 Literally any suggestions at all welcome - infrastructure improvements, security improvements, more accreditations for the company, employee education and training, more attack simulations? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I've played around with using windows update for this, it goes well since it does a lot in the background. But starting the update isn't always easy because it only shows up if there are absolutely no other updates available.
 Using an iso to upgrade is easy to start, but it takes a long time because the user can't keep working.

 first time posting here, but don't know where else to go.
 Did an migration from redirected folders to Onedrive, i did the following steps:
  
Set the policy to redirect the folder back to local user profile
 after a week, disabled this policy so that users got the files back in their own profile.
 enabled onedrive sync to upload the files to onedrive.
  
so far so good, all files migrated, fileserver can be disabled, however, there are still users accessing the fileserver, but no files, only the root directory's. 
 but the redirection policy is disabled, and if I turn of the fileserver users report their RDS sessions slow down.
 ​
 if you look in computer management you can see users accessing the root folders of their redirected folders, but nothing else, very strange behavior.
 ​
 Fileserver is on server 2012 r2, all other servers are on 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 ​
 we are a company distributed in 3 countries cca 3000 employees. We have to upgrade our WiFi controllers and APs on 2(smaller) of the 3 locations. Our network is currently entirely on Cisco.
 - 2 locations that are smaller ave cca 30-50 AP+ 2 controllers(Cisco 5508) - subscription expires this year
 - The main location has 216 AP + 2 controllers(Cisco 5520) - subscription expires end of next year
 On the smaller sites our subscriptions will expire. We will have to upgrade our old hardware. The problem is that management wants to change vendors. The IT(network) team wants to stay on Cisco. From our standpoint we would also agree to Aruba. But management wants Ruckus.
 This means that the vendor we chose for the smaller locations will also be coming to our main site with more than 200 AP.
 Does any one have any experience between the vendors Cisco, Aruba and Ruckus or any other enterprise vendor for a company of that size.
 Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
 best regards

Never mind all of the other more important fires I have to contend with.
 To make it even more ‘awesome’, the standard operating procedure that should have been developed by the team - who normally supports the appliances - wasn’t really put together until it felt like I asked. then they push me closer to the front to pioneer something that I don’t normally support, while waiting on others to be done with rack space so I can batch things.
 So, I pretty much said f it. At some point, you either care enough to not lose your job, or you learn as much as you can at the cost of losing your job. So I saw this as a glorious moment to try and automate it, even did it on my own dime. I figured it was worth the risk and it sounded fun. Well, I kept running into stupid little problems and my stuff got delayed. oops. But I learned sooo freakin much. The write up was worth it. I’m sitting here on significant amount of code that I’m pretty happy about, even with the remaining debugging. If I had got fired I would have shrugged, maybe felt a little worried but with unemployment.. I might be pretty happy about the prospect of real learning I could embark.
 I get some people really emphasize on the job learning, and I get it, but at some point you just hit a wall and you really have to fight for it or move to a management spot.
 Managers want you to be efficient, even at the cost of you learning marketable skills. Don’t buy into their landscape they try to carve for you- unless you share the same vision.

 Basically our sysadmin is on vacation, and I am the only person beneath him. Anyway, one of our domain controllers in a remote location was rebooted over the weekend. I can't ping it and I can't RDP to it. 
 I know it's online because I asked one of the guys in the office to take a picture of the monitor the DC is connected to through the comms room window lol. And the rest of their office is able to connect to wifi.
 In the past during a similar situation, I was able to fix this by getting someone to restart the Network Location Awareness service (just a random fix I found on Google).
 Sorry for the noob post, I know I deserve to be downvoted to oblivion but I'm panicking as I need to do some work on this server today.
 Thanks

 If i understood properly, first you create a RAID group, for example you make RAID 5 group and now you have 10TB stoage, so now you can create 10 LUNs, each is 1TB, and we make these LUNs so that Hosts can see it as logical disks that they can use?
 If this is true, than what are volumes for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I am currently working on an RDS environment for a client and ran into a bit of a snag. 
 The short version is that the server broker for two RDSs running Win Server 2022 no longer want to load balance people to the second RDS. When disabling additional sign ins for RDS1, users get an error saying that there are no more servers within the server pool. I will note that previous to the issue I will get into, it worked otherwise. 
 The context to all of this is that while working on RDS2 I accidentally installed a broker on the RDS. After it was installed, I uninstalled it but afterward the RDS licenses were not working. After getting it paired back up with the licensing server RDS2 appeared fine but the broker refuses to load balance to it. 
 As of now, RDS2 can be RDP'd into directly via IP and there is no issue. While going through the broker though it places all users on RDS1. I previously tested it by signing in multiple users and I got as far as 10 users on RDS1 before I stopped. It just appears that something broke within the broker itself but I have no idea where to start. 
 I am very new to the sysadmin world and I have tried literally everything I could research. Are there any additional ideas I should try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: I feel like the quality of this sub is degrading because people can’t stop being dicks to each other.
 Back in the day, we used to have mailing lists (e.g. Groupstudy), IRC chat, and web forums as avenues for network engineers to have technical discussions. Today the only visage left is Reddit and arguably Discord. More so, though, it seems the general attitude of everyone has changed from “Let’s discuss this, and I can help you clear up your confusion” to “I’m right, and watch me prove you wrong.” Sometimes this manifests itself as negative comments, but more often than not it’s downvotes.
 Now I don’t know about you guys, but I’m not on this sub for fake Internet points. Instead, I’d rather have meaningful conversations about networking, where I can potentially teach others about aspects of technology they don’t already know, and likewise, learn new things myself. Unfortunately, though, I find that pretty much no matter what people post, the peanut gallery is right there to shut them down.
 Three separate threads I replied to over this weekend with what I would consider helpful answers were deleted by the OPs, because they were getting hammered with replies to the effect of “wow you’re fucking dumb; go read your CCNA books again”.
 Is this really what we want to portray to people trying to get into this industry? Two mantras I’ve always told my students over the past 20+ years are that “the more you learn, the more you realize you don’t know”, and that “there are no stupid questions, only stupid people.”
 C’mon people, we’re better than this. Aren’t we all working towards the same goal of global communication?

For the next few years i don't see us swapping out Meraki access points and or the SD-WAN. A big issue we face at the moment is visibility in the switch space with no central management. 
 I have had limited experience with Aruba, however the AOS is simple enough and the switching has been solid from what i have been told. I have not touched CX
 I have plenty of Meraki experience, mostly good besides the shortcomings of their firewall product.

 I found this post with my same question but the solution was to use DHCP to point the phone to the correct VLAN - which unfortunately won't work for as we need to utilize different VLANs. 
 Has anyone had experience with this?

 Please see the attached topology. I have configured 2 VC between PE01 & PE02, each connected to one switch over 2 trunk links each side. All VLANs are allowed on the trunks from the switches and I am able to ping from one switch SVI to the SVI of the switch on other side of l2vpn using both vlans. But spanning tree shows both switch are root bridge for each vlan and none of the ports are being blocked. l2vpn is configured in port port. Why is this behavior?

 Oh, and does Microsoft have an official education platform these days? I haven't done this in over a decade so I don't even know where to start. This seems like the right place: Microsoft Certifications | Microsoft Learn

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys
 I'm just trying to figure this out - but almost everything I'm seeing on the web is coming up about server editions, rather than the underlying hardware.
 ​
 I've been asked to start the process to getting us compliant and certified with Cyber Essentials (not +) - and it's come to my attention that their recently installed DC [done just before I joined the team] almost every piece of hardware in there is EOL.
 Despite the hardware being EOL, they're all running the latest editions of Windows Server.
 Does the hardware support lifecycle bare any relevance to Cyber Essentials, or are we genuinely expected to recycle our servers every 4-5 years?
 I'm mindful that our SAN - which is only managed internally but is on a subnet that can make outgoing Internet access - may be considered in-scope, and this was EOL in 2020.
 Has anyone undertaken this task? Do we have to rebuild the DC with newer kit after only 7 months just to attain compliance?
 ​
 EDIT: Worth noting our DC is where our VPN is hosted - as well as all of our core servers. Our office premise have a site-to-site into the DC. 
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/networking, I'm working on a (next gen) firewall solution for a data center (expected ~15k campus users).
 The specs require physical firewalls as opposed to virtual. 
 Vendors I'm currently looking at are: CISCO, Forcepoint, Checkpoint, Palo Alto, Fortinet
 I need to suggest 3 vendors based on technical and commercial viability (budget isn't that tight, but we'd prefer a cheaper solution if the difference in quality isn't really all that). 
 I've been looking at their documentation and data sheets and they all seem to have practically the same features, more or less. 
 ​
  
Is there any clear winner among these? What differentiates them in terms of features and performance? They all seem to have the core capabilities of an NGFW: Packet Filtering (Layers 3 & 4), VPN, Stateful Inspection, Application Visibility & Control, Threat Intelligence, IPS.
 Relevant 3rd party benchmarks I'm looking at: Gartner and Cyber Ratings. Should these suffice? Which one should I prioritize? I've heard Cyber Ratings is more relevant since they actually test the hardware.
 Any other reliable sources that can help me evaluate and choose?
 I've heard Palo Alto is the gold standard, but is pricey (they reached out and said we can negotiate), and Fortinet is the most cost-effective and up-and-coming vendor. Is that true? 
 I'm currently leaning towards Forcepoint, since they are making some compelling arguments. They seem to have the best Firewall performance. Some of the main points they mentioned about their NGFW's include: 
 Best malicious signature detection, therefore best IPS/IDS. Apparently this is the most important metric to gauge a firewall's performance?
 Active-Active clustering for high availability 
 Best in the market to protect against evasion attacks
 
  
​
 I would highly appreciate any and all insights based on your experiences and research! I know there's a lot I wrote down, but really need the help. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently redesigning our OU structure and I feel we might be opting to go for a less than ideal OU structure that was proposed by a co worker given our requirements. I personally feel his has unnecessary OUs for the sake of having OUs and was only suggested to make our to AD look "tidy".
 Main Design Considerations:
  
1200 Users.
 10 different locations.
 Users are rotated between departments and even locations somewhat frequently.
  
GPOs currently include:
  
Folder Redirection depending on location
 Proxy GPO depending on location
 Printer Mapping depending on department
 Shared Folder Mapping depending on department
  
Co worker design: Currently there is a general OU for all PCs so I assume he's planning to keep that as is
  ->Location A OU --> Finance OU --->Marketing OU (which contains only users and shared folder) --> HR OU -> Location B OU --> IT OU 
 I had suggested that we keep a simple flat structure: 
 -> Location A OU Users objects of users belonging to location A -> Location B OU Users objects of users belonging to location B -> Computers OU --> Servers ---> Location A ---> Location B --> Desktops ---> Location A ---> Location B 
 The main reason for such a simple layout is due to there not being some major difference across departments that would require separate OUs. The main difference between departments at locations is their shared folder mappings and printers, which can be managed by groups instead of OUs. My main concern is that due to the frequent staff rotation, persons are going to have to be moved to the new location OU and be added to their respective department groups every few months to receive their location and department specific GPOs. Is there a structure that gets around this or is just a problem that should be solved with automation?

 I'm currently delivering free training on the full CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 20 modules and I will creating a dedicated video for each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since each video covers a whole module after all.
 I add time stamps in each video for you convenience if your only looking for something specific in a module or only want to refresh on a certain topic so please feel free to make use of them.
 There will be 22 videos for this course, the first is just the 6 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules with the actual course.
 The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+ and the other courses I deliver sho…]]></summary>

 this might be silly for you but I really could't find a way to solve it.
 Our small office is like this: All computers > our switch (TP-Link TL-SG2428P) > neighbor unmanaged switch > ISP router.
 ​
 * we couldn't change this topology for now !
 ​
 Everything is running for our users, but I am concered that our computers and theirs are in one network, and this is not good for security in the first place.
 ​
 So I have tried to create a new vlan for our computers, but the result is disconnection from internet !

 Each thought is valued : )

Still, I have never migrated an Onprem location to the cloud. Since I came to my current position where I have been for over a year as an Azure Cloud Admin, we have been on a merger freeze (the company usually buys dozens of small companies a year) and thus I have no experience there. This new job will focus a lot on mergers to the cloud and I wanted to see what are some things that need to be done to onboard an on-premise environment into the cloud or some literature/video for how-to's would be awesome. And just some general tips to ace this interview, usually pretty nervous in interviews.

 I’ve been struggling with this one.
 AD join Azure virtual desktops are failing to join the domain when deployed in the host pool or even manually I get the above message. 
 Things I have checked:
 DNS server in the VNET, set to custom, all matches the domain controller and can ping it.
 Disabled the lockout GPO for the admin and still getting that message.
 Any idea why I’m still getting that error message? What am I missing?
 I appreciate any thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Cisco Catalyst 2960X switch that has a single drop going to an inconvenient location. At the end of that single drop is an unmanaged, 8-port desktop gigabit switch. That switch is unmanaged, but passes tagged frames through it unmolested. There are six devices on that switch that don't know how to emit tagged frames themselves, and need to talk on the same VLAN. That's obvious - switchport access vlan 57 would do the trick.
 But there's one device there that needs to be on VLAN 69. It can emit tagged frames, so configuring the port like so would seem right: switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 57 switchport trunk allowed vlan 57,69 
 But, the conundrum is this: how do I keep devices other than the one that's meant to be talking on VLAN 69, from doing so on that port? It seems straightforward to use a MAC access-list, except that there doesn't seem to be a way to apply it only for frames tagged for VLAN 69. The devices on VLAN 57 are subject to change, so enumerating their MAC addresses is a giant pain.
 What I'd like is this - permit any host to send untagged frames, which end up on VLAN 57. Permit only one authorized host to send tagged frames; if they're tagged for anything but VLAN 69 then the allowed vlan config should take care of it. Is there a straightforward way to do this on a 2960x without either enumerating all the authorized devices for VLAN 57, using dot1x, or putting a managed switch down there?

 I'm done with my nerves and I hope to find help here. I hope, I'm right in this sub. I have 2 Exchange accounts - the first one is administrated by the IT department of my current employer. We recently started a small business and set up an own M365-Instance. So far everything seems to work properly.
 Currently we have only 2 active users, some external contacts and some groups. Now the strange behaviour:
  
When searching the directory from my iphone - everything is fine - I find the items
 In the "people"-tab, I can see all groups, contacts and users (Outlook Web Version)
 BUT: No matter what I type in into the "To"-Field in Outlook (Doesn't matter if Mac-Version or Webapp) I always get the message "No results found" - It doesn't matter, if I use my own name, the Account of my coworker or any of the groups. The result ist always: No results found
 If I use the same browser/mac client for the M365-Account of my current employer, everything can be found, as soon as I type in the "to"-field. Even if I hit the "x" to remove them from the suggestions, the entries from the directory are always displayed instantly
  
Please tell me, that I am just to stupid to find the right settings to activate. I searched for hours now :-(
 Thank you in advance.

 Anyone seeing similar behavior? Got any insight as to changes MS may have dropped that broke it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, long story short I got laid off last month after working help desk for a couple of years, before that I've had various somewhat-related IT jobs. I picked up a few CompTIA certs while doing help desk and started throwing my resume at everything with a pulse since my layoff. Lo and behold a small Healthcare company brought me in for an interview for a Sysadmin position (my dream job), something I felt highly unqualified for but thought hey what the heck! Well apparently they liked my resume, and I interviewed well enough, that they offered me the position! My feelings of elation and optimism were quickly replaced with dread, "what if I completely bomb it"?
 My last job was basically me working tickets from helpdesk and SOMETIMES using RDP to connect to servers to restart services, and perform various minor tasks. It suddenly dawned on me that I actually have pretty much no experience Administrating Systems! Cool! This is the most I've ever been paid, and it's a great IT position in an area where these jobs are few and far between (20 minutes from a small suburb in West Virginia, yay I live in the middle of nowhere). 
 Can some of you guys give me some encouragement? Or give me some confirmation bias that I'm going to get fired on Week 1? Anyone else find themselves in a role like this with a similar story? Thanks guys.

I've written close to 13,000 lines of code in powershell over the years so I feel pretty confident in it. For whatever reason, I just assumed that git always needed a command line interface to work with and that it wasn't worth the hastle to use. I thought you had to install a linux subsystem on your windows computer just to even work with it. So I just opted to store my scripts on onedrive and would just use ISE to edit scripts all the time. 
 Last night I decided to see what all the fuss was about with visual studio code and wow I feel like an idiot now. You can literally just have a version controlled, central repository of scripts, all in a nice GUI at your fingertips on any computer. Don't be like me, it's honestly pretty easy.

 New to network automation, I want to make sure my lab and processes are as close to the real world as possible. Currently I have a jinja2 template and variable file per device e.g. R1.yaml / R1.j2 , my inventory is through netbox api.
 Any update to the host yaml file triggers a ci/cd pipeline to do pre-configuration checks/validation, and post configuration checks/validation.
 This is cool with my small setup but how would this scale in a large enterprise ? My initial thought would be to have a yaml file for every single device ? What's the proper file structure that scales well ? How are you guys in the real world doing it ?

 Thanks!!

Currently, we use a SCCM task sequence and it does the job, and we've been able to customize quite a bit of it. However, I feel Intune might be a better route but from what I understand Intune doesn't push the update out to machines. Instead the policy can be used to customize how a machine behaves for windows updates that are pulled in another fashion, WSUS for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Small IT team covering everything, knowledgeable on networking but no expert.
 I'm trying to plan how to best configure a second L2 network link between our two sites without inadvertently creating a network loop, and where I cannot use spanning tree.
 We have two sites, each has connectivity via upstream provider which is part of the same organisation but separate (so we manage our own networking but don't have access to the upstream network), and we also use a bonded 2 x 1Gb Q-in-Q L2 tunnel over the upstream backbone connection to carry shared VLANs between sites.
 I now have a 10Gb dark fibre linking the sites directly, which I've initially configured with a single access VLAN to test connectivity but want to now configure as a trunk and gradually move the internal VLANs from the existing link to the new, ideally keeping the old link in place as a backup, or for less important traffic. The Q-in-Q tunnel strips out spanning tree packets. While I would remove a VLAN from the existing tunnel before adding it to the new link, I can't do that with the native VLAN 1, which would be present on both links and, without STP, would likely cause a loop.
 To further complicate things for me slightly, I'm running older Cisco kit at the first site (3850s at the core) and Ruckus at the second site (ICX 7650s) so configuration isn't just a copy/paste. Each site is its own spanning tree domain, so I'd be wanting to enable bpdufilter on the links anyway.
 Would setting the native VLAN on the new link to something other than default VLAN 1 solve this? Or should I bite the bullet, configure all the VLANs on the new link and simply shut down the old and enable the new, and be ready to switch back if it doesn't come up as expected? Or is there another approach? I'd prefer to do some more testing first, running the link as a trunk carrying a couple of test VLANs, but not causing a network loop is more important!

 I noticed the emails from the blocked domain are still delivered to the SaaS solution. After reproducing the issue, I came to the conclusion that blocked domains (and maybe more of the security?) are bypassed when mails are forwarded to outside the organization. 
 I created a ticket with Microsoft, but no response yet. Have you guys ever seen something similar?

Are they being fast and loose with this wording, where it's encrypted in transit ONLY outside of the physical fax machines involved?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, you read the title well, here is the context: I got some kind of lab (so don't worry it's completely legal and supervised) and I have to exploit anything I can imagine and an IMPORTANT thing is that I only have access to CMD on this Windows XP machine because I have accessed through a msfconsole exploit.
 So I think I've changed "Administrator" password with net user Administrator 123 (and just in case I: net user Adminstrator /active:yes) and now I don't know how to log as this user on CMD prompt because there is not a su root command in Windows (at least to my knowledge).
 Could you advise me what to do? I need to log as Administrator because only this user can access to a restricted file with data I need to go on.
 Or should I try some kind of privilege escalation stuff?
 Any case thanks in advance!

 I have an issue which I was not able to solve.
 EdgeRouter (Lite v2.0.9-hotfix.5) with Eth1 - static IP address ( public) and 5 VLANs on Eth2 eth2.100 to eth2.105.
 Internet (masquerade) works well on all the existing VLANs, excepting the latest addition eth2.105 (10.0.5.0/24).
 Nothing goes out to the internet from this VLAN eth2.105.
 5003 MASQ eth1 saddr ANY to 81.x.y.z
 proto-all sport ANY
 on the edgerouter I captured the icmp ping packets coming from a host to 1.1.1.3

 No reply !
 I have a S2S tunnel to this location and I can reach out to all IPs belonging to this VLAN.
 I can ping from the VLAN subnet Edgerouter management interface.
 Any advice how to further troubleshoot?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From RFC 1122:
  
When a connection is closed actively, it MUST linger in TIME-WAIT state for a time 2xMSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime). However, it MAY accept a new SYN from the remote TCP to reopen the connection directly from TIME-WAIT state, if it:
 (1) assigns its initial sequence number for the new connection to be larger
 than the largest sequence number it used on the previous connection
 incarnation
  
Why would you ever allow this?
 What if the server accepts the new SYN for a connection in TIME-WAIT state, and then the server starts sending data so fast that the sequence number wraps, and now there could be a duplicate segment from the old connection with the same sequence number? Is this not possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Maybe it has been asked before, sorry for bothering you in that case.
 We have a backup solution that has 2 copies of every backup: One on-site, the other in another physical location. Backup network is in it's own VLAN and the secondary location uses a physical server as iSCSI target for an immutable storage partition. 
 How do you guys accomplish off-line backup?
 Tapes can be used offcourse, but in a previous job they used tapes and the units were unreliable, therefor the backups as well and the job of chaging the tapes, well one should think there would be better solutions nowadays.
 Do you consider cloud storage as off-line backup?
 Do you use other smart solutions to make sure your backups cannot be reached from your internal network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: I'm a few cocktails in, so forgive this post.
 For nearly two decades I've been IT for what started as a family business, but grew into something significantly larger. Because the family member who started it was allergic to the optics of nepotism, I wasn't an employee, but rather encouraged to start my own business. Background: I hate Windows. My training, experience, expertise and history is in *nix servers, but my family had a business and needed IT help, so I helped. And what started as remotely helping make choices and advising a local technician (who would reformat a Dell PC with a legit license with pirated Windows because it had the settings he liked) resulted in a nearly twenty year stint as a "consultant." I even moved all the way across the country to help. At first, the family business was too small for a full-time IT Guy, so I wasn't hurt when I wasn't hired on ... I just found other clients. But of course the demands and the work expanded to fill the available time - even though the contract didn't keep pace.
 Anyway, I never wanted to be a Windows admin. I never wanted to do this for a career, and finally - as of today - I'm done. 
 Next week, I start a job doing what I used to love doing - we'll see if I still like it - but for now, it's a real relief to be done with email problems, Microsoft licensing, and fucking printers. I'd have written more, but the sub has a rule against throw-away accounts. 
  
Drink a glass with me, /r/sysadmin, here's to actually having benefits, getting paid what you're worth, and doing what you like to do.

 Wondering if anyone can help with a precision t5600
 the PSU was replaced from a 635, and got a 685watt instead... Now at boot pre-post there is a prompt saying the power supply is not the one originally configured for this machine blah blah blah. Press F1 to boot, f2 for setup, etc..
 How can I get ride of that prompt? Are there pins or something I can jump. There is nothing in the bios that will allow me to turn it off, like you typically can on a consumer bios. 
 I can't seem to find anything online...
 Essentially need to remove it as every time it boots/restarts it prompts that and needs F1 pressed before it continues to boot which will make it useless as a headless server. 
 Thanks in advance
 Pic of the prompt for reference.

Is there really any other valid purpose to PVLANs? The experts all seem to suggest that this is tied to layer 3 subnets but it's not like you can't have devices in different VLANs part of the same subnet as it is. As far as I'm aware, the only real purpose of 1:1 VLAN:subnet relationships is for better organization/consistency across L2 and L3. 
 EDIT: Got my answer here. Thanks so much for helping me understand this all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 I'm trying to set up an old IP cam that used to connect seamlessly to an app, until the manufacturer (foscam?) decided to discontinue the ddns.
 The manufacturer recommends using p2p to connect using the provided UID, but it doesn't seem to work at all, so my other option should be port forwarding or, of course, a VPN. However, my isp has me under a double NAT and doesn't allow me full network or router management. The only thing they can provide me is port forwarding the required port of the cam's ip.
 I know port forwarding an IP camera, specially an old model is a security concern, but since this is for eventual surveillance during specific hours or days and the camera would otherwise be off, how much of a risk could this pose? Is there any way to keep using this camera?
 Thanks for any help or suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We noticed on this new Dell Mx Blade architecture, that it supported two ways of partitioning a NIC. One was SR+IOV, the other was NPAR. When you are in the BIOS, you can select one of the following options:
  
None
 NPar
 SR_IOV
 NPar+SR_IOV
  
We are having a devil of a time understanding the true differences (and advantages/disadvantages) between SR_IOV and NPAR (different standards, but they accomplish roughly the same thing? why?).
 Even more confusing, is the "NPar+SR_IOV" option. Why would someone select both, versus one or the other? Does anyone understand this technology, the Use Cases, and why one would choose one versus another?

Thanks to the helpful comments, technical knowledge and support from this sub over the years I've been able to be great at my job and vastly expand my skillset, and helped me get this far. 
 After 9 years my manager, our IT Director for our small team of 4, is promoting me to IT Manager. (Actual title is 'IT Network Infrastructure and Security Manager'). 90% of what my job is now, all our sysadmin duty basically, except actually having the title and salary for it as I've slowly taken a lot of the reins over from my director over the past few years. A bit more autonomy and less red tape for approvals. The biggest thing I will have two desktop support people under me, our existing one at another site, and I will be able to hire my own desktop support to assist me at my site, which will be GREAT since I am the solo on site IT for our site which is also our corporate HQ. This is a big step up resume having experience with reports and having a manager title... something good to look forward to! 
 25% raise right off the bat. 38%-44% if you factor in bonuses being written into my contract. 
 Thank you again.

The last time a project like this failed, I had to lock and confiscate the phones of multiple execs when the waste and failure was exposed, but this time bomb probably has at least another year left before it goes off and people get fired. And they've been misrepresenting all of this in meetings and demos for the past few years.
 I'm in the clear (completely different department, no connection to app dev), but this is going to end with people way way above me getting axed at some point. 
 What's been the biggest project or planning f***up you've seen before?

 I was thinking about putting all the gateways in one place, connecting them to a single switch, and load balance all the traffic over those gateways. This way all my users are on the same network internally and they aren't handicapped by the limitation of just 1 uplink connection.
 Can I do this? if so, any recommendations on hardware?
 If not, can you recommend another way to add up 10 or so connections to behave like 1 up link?

We also periodically went into the office when vendors came by to do training or demos. Usually this training included a paid for dinner at an expensive restaurant. Having a $150 dry aged ribeye on the vendor’s dime meant that absolutely no one had any issues coming into the office for a day or two every couple of months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know it's often repeated how leased line is superior because of being dedicated as compared to broadband which is a shared medium.
 Lately I've been seeing in few countries, there's an option to opt for multi gig broadband which is possible due to fiber getting widely adopted.
 The biggest case for leased line till now was it can't go beyond 1gbps as Gpon is limited to 2Gbps. But the Xgspon is has started to be used, nokia has 25G pon. Huawei has its own version of 50G pon plus 100G pon has passed the standardization.
 So the question is does it really matter to use leased line if the same can be delivered effectively with 10,25,50 or 100G pon. I'm sure it's capacity will too rise in future.
 I kinda find it ridiculous that businesses pay huge amount for leased line when such solution are available. Now obviously not every ISP uses these latest version. But I wanna know am I missing something?

I'm pretty good at getting people up and running in minutes usually. I don't have any ticket back log. I just feel like I'm wasting my time. My stress level has been pretty bad lately and cause some medical issues (Dr thinks this)
 Is one person enough to handle all this? Am I just being a cry baby? I haven't spoken to anyone about this. I think in my mind they just think I sit around and play WOW all day and i'm afraid to speak up. I'd like to hear from similar people. If you don't want to post then please DM

So far my experience with it has been poor as I have found their documentation for getting the devices setup to be very lacking and I would not consider this a "Simple device setup" as their marketing says. 
 I talked to a few of my other networking friends who are Cisco fans but did not like it either and finding any other reviews has been helpful. Before I write this off as a half baked product idea from Cisco I thought I would ask if anyone here had a different perspective on it, if you had it running with any larger deployments, if you found their setup to be as confusing as i do.

 Also, I'm scouting at other places and currently updating my LinkedIn... I'm getting a lot of recruiters messaging about an IT Manager position.. Again a problem since I have no managerial experience lol.. any suggestions for a title?

 ​
 I'm hoping someone can help me out with this as Microsoft support is useless *sigh. Several people in our company are having connection issues with the outlook desktop app. The web app works just fine but every time you connect to the desktop app you receive an error "Cannot connect to the exchange server"
 It doesn't matter where the person is connected from as it happens at every location. Has anyone ever experienced this?
 I tried all the basic troubleshooting steps. Such as resetting the router, Uninstalling and reinstalling Office 365, updating Office 365, Signing out and signing back in, Disabling Zscaler.
 I've ruled out Zscaler as the problem as I've ran a computer without it for 24 hours and still nothing happened.
 ​
 Thanks for any advice and help.
 UPDATE: With Microsoft support help I was able to restore a few people's functionality. We used the restore Outlook cmd.
 Run in administrator mode:
 DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
 sfc /scannow
 I still have a handful who are not able to use the application still even with this.

 Configured Space—Total amount of space available on all of the configured volumes in the Storage Center.
 Allocated Space—Amount of disk space allocated on the disks for volumes plus RAID overhead. (Not used in Storage Center versions 7.1 or 7.2).

 ​
 We have active/active tunnels to a VNET in Azure, which belong to the same zone. We do not have ECMP enabled hence our routing always goes through tunnel 1.
 The app which runs in this has issue every time there is an azure maintenance and traffic is switched to tunnel 2.
 I read in the knowledge base that a session is defined like this:
  
On a Palo Alto Networks firewall, a session is defined by two uni-directional flows each uniquely identified by a 6-tuple key: source-address, destination-address, source-port, destination-port, protocol, and security-zone.
  
When you enter the below on the firewall
 show session id 1234567 
 You get an output confirming the above, but also mentioning the ingress/egress interface.
 ​
 My question is:
 Are sessions also binded to the ingress/egress interface? Will a non-SYN TCP packet be forwarded to tunnel 2 during the Azure maintenance, or would the client need to create a new session?
 ​

 So - I want to use Endpoint Manager (Intune whatever) but I am certain that it requires a Business Premium or E3 license at least.
 This is expensive and perhaps not the best solution for some customers - small to medium business size.
 To add more complexity in would be cool to use this in a multi tenant environment.
 So my question - is there a way to manage win 10 and mobile devices without either BP or E3? within Microsoft 365 administration - with licenses such as Business standard or exchange online?
 Or is it a matter of swallowing the Microsoft license pricing and get it over with?

 I already had DMARC checking enabled in Barracuda email protection which will check DKIM and SPF if there is a DMARC record. If there is no DMARC record, then nothing is checked. I thought it would be good to add DKIM so that DKIM is independently checked only if the sending domain does not have a DMARC record.
 DKIM has only been enabled for 48 hours and I have already had to whitelist 10 different domains. I could see this reaching over 100 in a couple weeks. We work with a lot of small companies and I am guessing that's why they have no DMARC or DKIM records. Starting to wonder if having this enabled is worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Friday everyone.
 I have a scenario, and I'm hoping someone can provide some insight. We are migrating an on premise Exchange 2016 server to exchange online, using CodeTwo Exchange Migration. I am assuming since this isn't hybrid, we can gracefully uninstall Exchange server and remove it from Active Directory.
 However the catch is that we will be setting up Azure AD sync soon after. This primarily to setup MFA on the RD Gateway, using the NPS extension. I've set this up before successfully with an existing tenant, matching local AD UPNs to exchange online mailboxes. In that scenario though, a local exchange server never existed.
 Long story long, can I perform the exchange cutover using 3rd party tools, decommission the exchange server; then setup Azure AD connect? Could there be issues with managing the mailboxes in exchange online once Azure AD sync is setup, even though we were not in a true hybrid Scenario?
 Please let me know what you all think, and if I need to clarify any details. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am trying to view all the emails sent by someone in my organization to an external address. Message trace is not an option since it can only go 90 days back. Management needs a report that shows all emails and not 90 days back.
 I tried using eDiscovery but it pulls nothing every time. It does not pull any email whatsoever. Is there a PowerShell script that I could use for this? Does anyone know a better approach for this?
 Edit -- Content Search is not working for me. Not sure what I am doing wrong but it shows no results. 
 Content Search Conditions:
 Search - mailbox: [email@mydomain.com](mailto:email@mydomain.com)
 To: externaldomain.com
 I also tried using keyword -- participants:externaldomain.com.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 maybe someone has encountered a similar behavior as we ... 
 We had the issue that during a bios update on the server , the Nexus 5k disconnected the FEX were the server was connected.
 The issue happened on different 5k versions with different Server hardware - only common piece is a broadcom card.
 According to Cisco TAC the issue is that the server NIC is sending massive amount of Pause frames during the bios update which is causing the 5k to disconnect the FEX to save the Nexus CPU from overloading ..
 ​
 This sounds just strange to me - why should the NIC send pause frames ... we did the BIOS update on about 400 servers and it happened only on 2 machins.
 ​
 The update killed both FEX where the server was connected - so it killed all servers which were connected to both FEXs.
 ​
 Just wanted to know if someone has seen something similar

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I have 3 domains in one azure tenant.
 spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com
 spiderman.com
 batman.com 
 I have created 50 users with UPN spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com. 
 99% of all those users will have [user@spiderman.com](mailto:user@spiderman.com) when we go live.
 Some of them will have same 'accountname' but other domain. 
 e.g
  
UserA is created as [fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com)
 With E5 license assigned. When we go live, i'll change the users UPN to [fanta@spiderman.com](mailto:fanta@spiderman.com) 
 
UserB is created as fanta@batman.com
 With E5 license assigned. 
 
 Since my fallback-domain is spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com and other possible attributes in the tenant might be connected to this domain. Can my practice cause any problems? 
 Reason why I am worried is 
 UserA
 [fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com) will obviously have [fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com) as an SMTP adress in exchange. This account have "Identies" in Azure AD s[pidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com). 
 ​
 UserB
 [fanta@batman.com](mailto:fanta@batman.com) will only have [fanta@batman.com](mailto:fanta@batman.com) as SIP and SMTP adress in exchange.
 But this account also have "s[pidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com)." as identities in Azure AD. 
 E.g "Identities" in Azure AD. Even If I create the user as [fanta@](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com)batman.com the Identities in Azure AD is spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com - I believe this will change if I change the fall-back domain or the primary domain (?) 
 Is my practice a problem? Is there any best-practices or workarounds by not creating an other tenant with batman.com as domain (?)

 I figure this must be a fairly common scenario but it's something I've rarely if ever encountered. We're a small business so I can't really hide behind buerocratic processes. And I expect to be seeing these people in person later due to other work making it even harder to duck the question.
 (I don't know or need to know the reason why. I don't think the user is being immediately sacked; I've been told their PC and other logins can stay active.)

 One thing I've encountered is if I disconnect a network cable and reconnect it straight after, the authentication on a windows client fails. I need to leave it about 30 seconds or so and then try again.
 I don't see anything on the NAC suggesting it is even making a request, so I've a feeling there's maybe a timeout or cooldown on the switch for reauth? Would that make any sense?

 I have two Linux servers in Azure. The first is a database server and the source for an outbound connection to the remote server. The second server is a StrongSWAN VPN server that we route to in order to get to the customer. Because of the customer’s VPN requirement, I have setup a routing rule on the database server that our Maximum Segment Size (MSS) is 1360:

 Anyone else encountered an issue with getting failed login attempts when connecting to a Hyper-V VM via FCM or Hyper-V and sometimes intermittently via SCVMM? 
 The issue I'm currently seeing is when I connect to a VM from a management server which doubles up as a DC I'm getting a failed login attempt from the Hyper-V console and even after putting the right credentials in, it is still failing. It is not doing this entirely for all VMs. If I try from another management server (another DC) It is allowing logins just fine and can see the VM console to enter the password for the VM. I can login just fine to the Hyper-V hosts with the same account and can migrate VMs etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 After the Rackspace ransomware incident in December, I migrated my email to Microsoft 365 because I didn't really have the time to explore other options. Now that I have, I want to free myself from both Rackspace and Microsoft altogether.
 I have numerous reasons for not wanting to stay with Microsoft which I won't get into as it's not really relevant. My issue is more of a technical one.
 So, I'm planning to migrate to a regular IMAP provider and have been able to enable IMAP for my M365 account, but with MS disabling basic auth I can't use imapsync to migrate the email due to it having issues with OAuth.
 I'm not above setting up a local IMAP server and converting my PST file(s) to Maildir if that's what it takes, but I'd rather find something that will just copy everything across and not require any user intervention.
 So I guess my question is whether anyone knows of something that will allow me to do this.
 Powershell script, bash script, installable applications, anything that works and which is NOT "Copy everything across manually".
 I run Linux at home and Windows at work, and I'm ideally looking for something fully functional and free. I'm not against paying for software, it just feels like a waste paying for a license for a program I will use once, as this will be a one-time thing.

 My question: If I use foo.com as my internal domain, what should I point the public (registrar) nameservers to?
 Of course, I have internal resolution working perfectly well already regardless of the public nameservers, since I control internal (local) dns, but I’m interested in what people here consider best practice for the public nameserver value. Should I point it to my internal (private) IP to ensure any stray queries from my networks are resolved? Should I point it to an empty zone in a public nameserver?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I received an email which has some attachments destroyed. I assume that some SMTP gateway destroyed that during spam or antivirus scanning. The message was completely recompiled (I know the sending tool and the original MIME encoding was completely different). I want to help the sender to identify the bad device and wonder if it is possible to identify the vendor of the gateway by the used MIME boundary?
 This are the used boundaries:
 boundary="----=_NextPart_000_7D6C_01D92C30.D0148B80"
 boundary="----=_NextPart_001_7D6D_01D92C30.D014B290"
 Sadly, the header does not give me any hint about the gateway because I do not see anything in the received fields except the last outgoing IP. This device seems to also remove anything previous.
 Due to a google search, I think it may be a Checkpoint firewall, but is there some experience about such headers?

 Network Architect here - I finally deployed some PA firewalls (basic ACLs before) to separate SCADA and Enterprise, which currently shares the same hardware but on different vlans. 
 Right after finishing this, I've been told they want IT out of the network itself and want to manage it with some Rockwell branded Cisco switches. My team would be in charge of the firewall and that's it. This... Seems like a bad idea to me? They don't have network experience nor Cisco experience and it's about 40-45 switches they'd take over. 
 For folks with SCADA or PLCs in your environment, do you manage those networks? Do the plant operators? I'm looking to see what the SOP for this kinda thing is. I've no qualm if they want to use these switches but I feel like you'd want the people who know how to manage and monitor them to... do that for you?@

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello;
 I'm looking for a simple ethernet port tester, something that will simply show if the port is connected to a switch and determine 10base-t or 100base-t (not necessary to tell if gigabit, but would be nice) or if the port is being used by an analogue phone or PBX... 
 I'm currently using a Test-um TP-100... it's small and I carry it around with me in my laptop bag. Much quicker to simply 'whip' it out and test the network jack to see if it is connected, than booting up the laptop and seeing if there are network lights. It's really quick to check all the ports in a 48 port patch panel to see if there is anything plugged in at the other end.... 
 I want to purchase a second unit... because it seems that the TP-100 is no longer available. What is everyone here using?

 So I’m working on untangling a bunch of shadow IT at an org and I’m hoping you guys can give me some insight on how you would handle announcing this to leadership, execs, and dev team that think they need local admin rights and Global admin rights to 365?
 What type of solutions are out there that might help some of the pushback I receive or justification questions I might want to ask?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is technically my first time posting here and just want to get your guys feedback. I’ve been with this same company for 12yrs and I have seen a lot of changes over the years of my employment there. When I first joined it was a non-public company, my previous boss was great, I had time to research on certain projects, put in extra time (not because I had to but I wanted to). Within the years of employment, I’ve seen the company become Public, I’ve been promoted several times, made a name for myself (all the execs know me) and now a manager leading two different teams. However, I feel that it has become more stressful. For me personally I’ve also had things change over the years, I got married back in 2020 to my best friend and we now have a newborn (Baby Girl). I just returned back to work last week and I’m currently struggling on getting back into the groove of things. I’m use to sometimes staying late just to catch up on some work or go in on the weekends to help with maintenance that I can’t necessarily do during the week. You might be asking, why am I doing this…? Because of staffing issues. Yes, I lead two teams but they are a small team and most of them have just started within last year. At this moment, I feel like I’m slowing down and I cannot possibly stay late anymore nor work on the weekends as I use to. My fear is loosing my job due to performance as there are a lot of projects but I feel like staffing is an issue. The one thing I’ve told my employees repeatedly is that Family comes first, no matter what.
 Just thought I’d share on here to get your guy’s thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for an engineering company that is testing some cellular modems. These modems need to hit internal systems for testing. The IPs of the cellular modems change frequently - within restarts or days - so having a trusted IP list in the access list won't work. Most of the services being hit from the NAT rule require some sort of authentication. However, this is for test engineers who have no reason to consider security. Along with that, they may be testing on an OS or services that have known vulnerabilities. 
 I've been contemplating this for a few days and the only thing I can think of is to put the test VMs on a small private VLAN so their at least contained. On top of that, I figure I may as well add a list of trusted IPs based on the cellular network they are using to at least be somewhat explicit on the access list. However, with my ignorance of how their systems work, there is still the possibility of a bad actor exploiting some vulnerability and possibly getting some sort of foothold and/or company IP. This would be a very targeted attack, but I have to consider the possibility.
 Does anyone have any experience with supporting something like this or have a better idea on how to enable the engineers to get their jobs done while still keeping the company internal network secure along with any IP on the test systems?
 TL;DR: Engineers need to have cellular modems connect to systems on our internal network. My thought is a basic NAT rule allowing any outside connection to that IP:PORT for port forwarding to their systems which I put on a private VLAN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company uses SaaS software since we're primarily remote work, before I joined there wasn't any process in place to check to see if the vendors we utilized actually protected our data. Now part of our software vendor vetting/onboarding practice involves getting either a copy of a SOC2/ISO27001 audit report or having them fill out a vendor security questionnaire so we can get a good idea on their data handling processes. I'm going through our backlog of vendors and requesting these of them so I know where we stand risk wise.
 Every vendor I've reached out to has supplied a SOC2 Type 2 or ISO audit report after throwing an NDA my way. However in a first, I've gotten this email back from a certain collaborative tool vendor.
  
Hey /u/by_frozenriver, Thank you for reaching out and addressing your request!
 SOC 2 report can only be shared under NDA (which is signed with Enterprise customers), so please let us know if you’d like to evaluate it for your company, and we will gladly pass your request to our Sales team.
 We're glad to inform you that the option to download a SOC 3 report is available on our website. We'd like to point out that diagrams in SOC 3 report are publicly available as a preview, the actual files in high resolution fall under the Security review that we conduct for Enterprise customers only. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused here, but as per our internal Security Policy it is not possible to share the docs in question with non-Enterprise customers and that is not something the Support team is allowed to share at all as we do not conduct Security reviews.
  
I've reached out to them to see if they'd fill our security questionnaire in that case. But still, what a weird practice. Pay for the product (on it's highest tier) and then we'll show you that it's safe?
 Definitely going to be looking into alternatives before this annual commitment is up.

 Right now they use Cisco access points whose authentication is done using the user information in Active Directory. It uses LDAP to do this. The company wants to replace the Cisco access points with the newer Netgear ones, but they still want it to use LDAP to direct authentication. I’ve looked at the user manuals for the new line of products at Netgear that they have listed right now and they seem to only be able to do authentication through the cloud, or by setting it up with a RADIUS server. 
 Are the newer products just not compatible with LDAP, or am I missing something? I’ve seen that the older models could connect to LDAP via the WC7520 or WC7609 controller but I don’t know if that’s still the case with the new access points. I’ve contacted a representative at Netgear but they haven’t got back with me.
 Am I at a dead end?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to solve this for weeks now: 
 Problem A) NFS connections on my network are barely usable, starting slow then slowing down even more until almost no more traffic passes trough writing/reading from NAS and/or other clients. SMB on the other hand works almost flawlessly though. Problem B) Every traffic from within the network actually doesnt seem to be steady and this behaves in a repeating pattern: it goes from fast to mediocre or even halts every few seconds goes back to full speed and then repeats this behavior after a a few seconds. It’s the same from outside the Network, downloading or uploading from/to the entire network: Client will actually see these interferences aswell.
 After everything I’ve tried I think I narrowed it down to UDP and probably one of the two switches in the network. IPerf between peers and/or NAS or other clients or servers: everything seems fine - except for UDP. Cant establish a connection. Netcat UDP works between all machines except one though : on that specific machine Netcat only works exactly ONCE and then loses (or closes?) the connection immediately. I had good NFS results with a test-share on the NAS when I explicitly disabled UDP + I don’t allow Sync - resulting in up to 1GB/s read and write to the NAS. (SMB is at about 600MB/s) MTU is 1500 everywhere. Turned off Auto-Negotiation and Flow Control everywhere. 
 Any ideas what this could be? In case I observed correctly, I can rule out the following: cables and/or NAS by now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm especially interested in feedback from this crowd since I imagine many of you have pushed out large scale distributions of thunderbolt docks - possibly varying models and brands.
 I dipped my toe into the waters of thunderbolt starting 4-5 years ago with the Dell WD19. I only got around 10 of them in place, but every single one of them would periodically stop recognizing that they had an ethernet connection until the user unplugged and replugged the dock and then rebooted their laptop.
 Then around 3 years ago I rolled out about 50 Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Gen 2 docks with matching X1 Carbon laptops. It seemed like around 50% of those docks ALSO had similar issues, dropping ethernet occasionally, as well as USB devices no longer being recognized, and HDMI outputs dropping their signal. Again, easily resolved with a reboot of the laptop and maybe a power cycle of the dock... but frustrating my users. Since then the reliability rate seems to be much improved... about 90% of those docks are fully reliable now running on Lenovo's latest 3.1.81 firmware plus Intel's latest thunderbolt drivers/firmware. Though oddly, the remaining 10% are unreliable despite all of those same updates.
 And so I've moved on to replacing those remaining 10%, and have mostly been replacing them with the Caldigit TS4... which is obscenely expensive. But (knock on wood) so far with a limited roll out, I've yet to have any user call me about an issue once the initial setup and firmware update was done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen alot of hate spewed at Cisco ACI. Personally, I've never was interested in deploying it, as I prefer building networks based on strictly open standards where possible versus a vendor black box solution. That's just my design style. 
 I recently came across a thread about ACI while doing some research on the product, in which /u/bmcgahan asks critics of ACI to provide evidence that ACI is dying. 
 Curious about this, I did a simple linked in search on job roles for proprietary technologies like NSX and ACI on Linkedin within the United States. Here are the results:
 ACI NOT Cisco - 4,344 
 Nexus Dashboard - 3 (All from Cisco)
 Arista CVP NOT Arista Networks - 4,145 
 NSX - 1,533 
 Apstra NOT Juniper Networks - 5 (3 of those were from "Juniper Apstra" so it's really 2 jobs)
 EVPN - 385
 VXLAN - 743 
 ​
 I feel like you all owe /u/bmcgahan an apology. Cisco is a vendor people love to hate on. Yes their licensing and certain marketing practices are despicable, but there seems to be a market out there for ACI, contrary to what people are saying. 
 After this brief search, I plan to spend some time to learn more about the solution and see where the opportunities might be.
 Edit: Also to be fair and for context, Cisco is a behemoth of a marketing machine with many more feet on the ground when it comes to sales, so naturally their numbers are expected to be bigger. It doesn't mean other vendor solutions are better or worse.

 I did a Wireshark capture, and I can see that both peers change the keepalive, after the spoke send a new keepalive and doesn't get an answer, I see a bunch of TCP retransmissions and the spoke sends the keepalive notification and resets the connection:
 And in the other site, is the same thing both sites change the first keepalive, and after that, the hub sends a new one but never gets a reply. And reset the connection.
 https://ibb.co/TMsVGpw
 The strange thing is if I do a ping from spoke "bgp peer ip" to hub "BGP peer ir" I have 1 to 2 percent of packet lost. I thought could be an isp issue, but even if I increase the hold timer to 10 min I get the reset.
 would be any other reason beyond a poor internet connection?

 Something is bugging me because I cannot find a solution to my problem. 
 I have a switch template that I put together which includes SNMP v3 config. 
 The issue I've got is that I want to have in the template, the encrypted SNMP v3 credentials and not plain text. 
 For the life of me I cannot find a way of doing this. 
 I've tried using an online SHA1 and AES128 generator but the AES128 generator asks for a private key, and I have no idea what that would be from the Cisco switch perspective. 
 I'm hoping I'm just overlooking something here. 
 Does anyone have any ideas or pointers? 
 Thanks.

 Say you're an MSP and have a primary and a secondary location, and all managed services are available in an active-passive way. Typically how will the networking move from primary to a secondary location if the primary were to go down? 
 In my case we have very old architecture: internet->router->fw->core and not much else. I'm assuming i need something like SDWAN to take care of this?

 Is there a setting to change this?

 We have two workstations in our office with the exact same specs. Everything. The only difference is I'm running Windows 11 and the other one still has 10 on it. We both connect to a TrueNAS server in our rack via multimode fiber (LC-LC) using the same network cards and SFP+ modules. HOWEVER, when I copy a test file of zeros i get about 450MBps read from the TrueNAS server (it writes at 1.1GBps always) - dropping down every 7-8 seconds consistently to 200MBps or less, while the other workstation consistently reads AND writes at 1.1GBps using the same file. This has been tested with 10 and 90GB versions.

 I've been using a little powershell script to grab console images of VMs running on my Hyper-V hosts for a while now. I recently ran into needing to be able to flip through them a little quicker than I could with my script. So, I decided to throw together a small interface to take quick peeks at running VMs. This is definitely a super niche tool, but I figure if it's useful for me, perhaps it will be useful for someone else too!
 Here's a quick gif of what it looks like.

After three weeks that I felt like I was failing constantly, not being able to focus on the important tasks and being overwhelmed with the sheer tasks to do, my boss is finally coming back on Monday. 
 That said, I attended company dinner today. Before the meal, the CEO and the higher ups thanked the whole staff for the successful last year. The junior CEO started with some basic things and then suddenly goes: " and we got a letter in our complaint box. I want to read it to you". For those who don't know what a complaint box is, it's a box where you can file complaints anonymously. I was shocked when the Junior read the message out loud and the first thing she said was my name. My whole body tensed up. Then she continues "I want to thank you for your help. You are always kind and you solve all my problems. I whish the company would give him a extra reward"
 I was not expecting that at all. It never happened to me before. It gets even more surreal. As the clapping the toned down, service department leader stood up and said: "On that note, i want to add that he is alone at the moment and has a shit ton of work but he even worked late yesterday because I needed him to set up something for me"
 This feels so great. Some people actually do care for and notice the effort I put into my work. I think this will be forever engraved in my memories. Has anyone of you similar experiences? Does that happen a lot? It really does make a difference if you get praise from people around especially on days I fell like I suck hard. I myself will start praising other people more often.
 Edit: Thank you for the rewards. Very kind

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry I'm going to be ranting a little bit, but perhaps we can also start a discussion.
 I recently had to work with a bunch of RJ45 connectors that had boots as shown in the picture:
 Awful boot
 And it was a somewhat frustrating experience. Not TOO bad, but I must say that is the dumbest connector boot design ever, and it's really popular for some reason.
 Here's why it's terrible. The flaps on the sides. I understand they are there to prevent the tab getting snagged on something. But they're not actually guaranteed to work for that because something can still technically get in between them and snag the tab.
 But by far the worst thing about them is that you cannot easily press the tab and release the connector. It's actually quite annoying, even when you figure out the best way to do it, you still can't quite get a good push on the tab and it often feels like you're scraping the connector as you're pulling the cable out.
 Every other design has realized this, so they have the anti-snag thing go over the tab so you can press on it directly and release the cable, also guaranteeing the tab will never get snagged. Easy, sensible, works. But whoever designed this boot was too stupid to realize this, did they even test their creation once? And then for some reason it caught on and is now quite a popular design.
 Am I missing something? It's terrible, right? I know I'm overreacting, but what are you gonna do... first world problems.
 Edit: Reading the comments, I guess I this is actually one of the nicer designs when you consider how god awful some of the other ones are, ending up under the tab or hardening over time... I just hate not being able to easily get my finger in between the flaps to press the tabs and now I see that it can be so much worse... LOL. Why isn't there a good design that just works that the industry can converge on.

 Networking has been my bread and butter for years. I took some time out to dabble in cybersecurity tool integrations, however the only time I was really happy in that role was working with the network shops on the customer side, helping them configure, troubleshoot, and sharing knowledge along the way. So I decided to make a move back into networking. The welcome was warm and I quickly found a new home.
 So my question for the field - is GNS3 still the hotness when it comes to network modeling and plain old CLI practice? I need to get smart on Cisco DC in a hurry, and already targeted CCNP DC since the new environment is heavy on Nexus 9k infrastructure with a sizeable SAN. All of the campus networks are Catalyst 9k. I have dabbled with Nexus in the past, but only at a very basic level so I need to explore the advanced features and nerd knobs.

 Also, the "neighbor x.x.x.x route-server-client" line doesn't show up in running config or persist across reboots, but I'm guessing that's an IOSv bug and unrelated to EVE-NG. Any hints on either one would be appreciated.

I got into computers because I failed at drawing squares and circles ( wanted to be a graphic designer but didn’t have the patience) and computers were the only thing i was any good at. That and I was mislead by the belief that at some point in my it career journey I would be able to work and not have to talk to people (I’m a bit of an introvert). 
 Now that I’ve been in IT for the past 15 years, my dreams of not having to talk to people have gone away but if I could I would work for a single company instead of a MSP, and to find a company who’s willing to invest in me as much as I would invest my time into their IT infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to setup freeradius to provide LDAP auth against our AD server for network devices (Cisco).
 I've been able to bind to AD and provide basic auth, but I can't seem to get group's working.
  groups { base_dn = "${..base_dn}" membership_attribute = "memberOf" membership_filter = "(|(&(objectClass=group)(member=%{control:Ldap-UserDn})))" cacheable_name = "yes" cacheable_dn = "yes" } 
 From my understanding, this should populate an attribute called LDAP-Group with all of the groups a user is a member of?
 I would then go into my site configuration and add some logic/statements to provide different replies in post-auth based on what's in that attribute ?
 I've scoured the net for working examples and attempted to copy/modify them with no such luck.
 I'd love to know how I can output the users groups to console while running freeradius -X as well... just to troubleshoot a little further (make sure the groups are being returned correctly).
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of our PCs are connected to our domain with passwords managed through our local AD server and synced with Azure AD. For those accounts/PCs, when logging into the device, the password is case sensitive and using incorrect capitalization will cause the login to fail. However, it has come to my attention that for at least one of our machines running Windows 10 Pro (21H2, 19044.2486), which is connected to a consumer Microsoft account, Windows accepts the login password regardless of the case of the letters. That is, if the Microsoft account / PC login password was BlueCyber, a user could login with bluecyber or BLUECYBER or bluEcYbeR.
 Everything I've read makes it sound like that shouldn't be happening. Is there a setting somewhere that controls case sensitivity checking on Windows 10 with login via Microsoft accounts?
 This isn't a huge vulnerability, but it does mean passwords are weaker than we otherwise expected because it effectively eliminates 26 characters from the character set.

 My script aims to mitigate that by supporting as many applications that I can.
 You can find details on it here:
  
https://github.com/TheAlienDrew/OS-Scripts/blob/master/Windows/Microsoft-Endpoint-Defender/
  
Upon navigating to my GitHub repo, you'll find information on using the script, using the Intune version, and how to generate shortcuts (from unaffected computers), to add onto my script.
 At this time, there are roughly over 130 supported applications! (including support for 32-bit, 64-bit, and user app installs!)

 We have a problem whenever a Teams/Group (and thus SharePoint) is created from Teams, the SharePoint is created in our original SharePoint language (not English) even though our organization's "preferred language" is set to English. Unlike when creating a SharePoint from the admin portal, from Teams there is no option to set the SharePoint language.
 This is already bad enough, but apparently it's seems impossible to change the language afterwards:
  
Site Information -> Language settings shows " The default language for this site " but it cannot be changed.
 Powershell set-unifiedgroup -language does not change anything
  
The main problem here is that whenever a folder is shared from this SharePoint, the email will be in the wrong language. Anyone have any idea? The only option seems to be to delete the SharePoint and create a new one from the admin portal...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My institution uses a self-hosted open source web-based digital signage solution. I need a computer that:
  
Boots on power loss to a full-screen web browser
 Has enough specs to play a YouTube video smoothly in a web browser while outputting 4K resolution
 Can be remotely rebooted, take/view screenshots remotely, and preferably see basic stats like IP address or CPU utilization
 Doesn't have a recurring revenue model, but a fixed one-time cost
  
We have traditionally used Chromeboxes for this, but their security updates expire after a couple of years, and the future of Chrome Apps is up in the air. Chrome Apps are the system that Kiosk Mode uses. We don't know if this is going to be possible anymore come 2025.

 The situation now is, that a S***storm is coming my way from higher up, and there is still no contact from Microsoft... I have no idea on where to start , the situation is a little tricky. our HQ is in the US while R&D is in Europe (but for regulatory reason, I need to get in contact with a US sales rep) 
 Does anyone have/had the same issue, and how to overcome it?

 I need to find a solution where i can run the script from my USB drive without actually knowing the path to my USB drive.

 I am trying to delete the download Folder of all my AD Users (About 4k) once a month.
 My Solution would be running the following Script once a month through the Task Planner on the Server:
 $profname = Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users -Directory | Select-Object -Expand Name
 ​
 foreach ($name in $profname)
 {
 $path = 'C:\Users\' + $name + '\Downloads'
 Get-ChildItem -Path $path –Recurse | Remove-Item –Recurse
 }
 Is there maybe a better solution (Maybe from windows Directly) for this? The Profiles are saved on the Server.

We are having an issue where, when users connect to our network (both wired and wireless), it takes several minutes for devices to be able to browse the internet. DHCP info is assigned and websites are pingable straight away (both IP and URL) but initially nothing displays in the browser.
 We moved the SVIs from our core switch to our new firewall over the weekend and are now supposed to be using our SD-WAN provider's DNS. However, this issue still persists when using Google DNS. The issue also happens when a machine is moved to a different desk but on the same VLAN.
 Pings and traceroutes seem ok, I just can't explain the delay in being able to browse web pages. Could it really be DNS?

 Ive been trying to find an answer to this but my google fu is lacking, I thought I would ask for opinions
 Currently, we have domain group accounts (domain\serveradmins) listed within the local adminstrator groups on tier 1 servers
 we are using LAPS on the servers for the builtin\administrator account
 I'm trying to understand whether it would be best practice to remove domain\serveradmins for the local admins group so the builtin\administrator is the only account with admin perms
 currently I can't get WAC to manage using the windows > LAPS option but thats another story
 what accounts have admin pems on other peoples servers?
 thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a TED talk if you prefer the format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am-XbS0y0hE
 Anyway, I've had a pet theory for a while now that sysadmins are selection-biased towards higher than average ADHD. 
 Sort of inherently the 'problem solving/ticketing' pattern that's common to a lot of sysadmin roles, along with occasional needs to hyperfocus ... seem to slot in very nicely with people with ADHD - not that it's not a problem exactly, but a lot of the core traits and coping strategies are well suited to this type of job.
 Maybe it's just me? I mean, after a spate of therapy and treatment for depression and anxiety, I've been referred on for ADHD assessment. I've just set the ball rolling on that now, because ... well, I know self diagnosis is something of a dubious thing, but over 20 years in the profession I'm increasingly believing that "this is me". 
 But I've fallen into an ecological niche in the business world that suits my brain. 
 Because my 'coping strategies' are also ... genuinely beneficial for a 'sysadmin' role. Being great at analysis and problem solving helps me cope with really poor memory retention. I often can't remember things from the previous day, let alone week, but ... that's ok, because I can get to the same place and continue quite rapidly. Working off tickets means my retention doesn't matter. Hyperfocus on something that interests me is amazingly useful when it comes to understanding how all the pieces of a complex system mesh together. etc.
 There's also some things I just know I can't do though, and I avoid those.

A go straight through, B go 1-12 on one end and 12-1 on the other. C swap pairs so 123456789 10 11 12 goes 21436587 10 9 12 11 . What I can't find any reference for anywhere, and I've spent nigh on an hour googling and reading, is when to use which? The plan is to run ONE cable direct between MC2207411-SR4L across the room for validation and testing, with no keystones, no patch panels, no fiber boxes or splitters, and a big spool of unused optical cable sitting on the floor tucked away in the corner. So the over all polarity between two MC2207411-SR4L, is it A, or B? (I'm relatively sure it's not C)

 Image of the notification:https://imgur.com/SceRvwu
 We do use this service but only have it set-up for adult content and have not adjusted any of the settings for it at all. I can't find any rule that should be blocking s3 unless it got lumped into the adult content category by Microsoft lol.
 It also does seem to be actually blocking random images on websites I am visiting (that use S3 to host those images)
 These blocks are not showing in Defender protection history on our machines and they are also not showing in the Web content section of security.microsoft.com either (not certain how long this takes to show data). I've received about 15 of them in the last hour so I am hoping this isn't the start of a fun Thursday morning tomorrow.
 Maybe I am being a little gun shy here after last Friday, but I was curious if anyone else is seeing this or have any other ideas on places for me to look? 
 --EDIT--
 Thanks for the confirmtion
 The issue appears to be related to Edge Smartscreen blocking connections to S3

 Background- our company builds custom automated work cells/manufacturing equipment. We have a customer who has 20+ of our systems and the HMIs are Rockwell PanelView Plus 7 Performance Series A terminals that run Windows CE 6.0. Due to Windows CE 6.0 being obsolete, Rockwell has phased out Series A and introduced Series B terminals that run Windows 10 IoT Core. Now, with series B terminals- IPP printers are supported.
 At the completion of each product run, a report is generated on the HMI and a screen capture print is sent to the printers via network. It has become extremely difficult to find a modern printer that is still compatible with the drivers available on Windows CE 6.0. With the introduction of the Series B terminals, our customer now needs to maintain multiple printers- ones for the old Series A terminals and ones for the new Series B terminals.
 Is there a print server solution available that would emulate older printers that the Series A terminals can send their print job to via network using an existing Windows CE 6.0 printer driver, then convert and re-transmit the print job to a modern printer (IPP)?

 I hate it in my DC when I have anything EOL. Inevitably, something always slips through and no matter how much I scream and shout, it has to stay for some ridiculous reason.
 I'm visiting a site where instead of balking at something I found under the covers, I was actually amazed. Thrilled actually - something that was so old, but still a necessary part of our infra. I was doing an audit of a sites IT and was taken to 'another' computer room. In there, sat a guy next to a Concurrent. This is a mini-computer that was installed in 1987 - and it's still going and needed to support some legacy equipment we supply out in the field which is still in use (and has one of these sitting next to it). I haven't seen a real-time computer with a built in 6250 tape drive since probably 1990 and it was incredible that this thing was still chugging like a champ.
 It's isolated of course, but the tech on it is probably immune to attack anyway as who the hell out there can hack a machine which no one out there even knows it's OS.
 It's a testament to the company, to the guy who's operated it for 35 years and the fact that they have adapted it to operate using modern tech (SD cards) and keep it going. We have more out there as well that our techs find ingenious ways keeping alive, even after the parts are long gone.

Recently, my company replaced 2 of our network cabinets and tidied up our connections by pulling unused connections out of the cabinet and wrapping them in the ceiling. Now management wants to disable the ports that are not being used for security purposes. One thing we want to still be able to do is use our network tester to plug in to a port in the facility to trace it back to the network port in case someone moves to a different location. How can I do this but still keep people from just plugging in and it working? My fist thought is a vlan that is not configured and is just Disabled so we can still track it but they can't access anything until we activate it. Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I was wondering if any of you work in high-density compute and if this is a common thing. It's probably called something that I can use to google more examples and learn about it. 
 All TOR-leafs connect to all leafs in their row
 All row leafs in a pod connect to the pod's spine
 All pod spines connect up to the super-spine.

This results in X amount of employees basically reaching out at once to support desk or project member (a high cost resource) for very low-level troubleshooting. Repeat for each client rollout and it ends up being an exponential amount of time spent on negligible tickets for end users. 
 As a way to reduce client call-ins following the "go live" date: I was wondering if there was something in Azure AD like group policy that could be configured on event (example: attempted basic authentication AFTER go live date) to trigger a notice with custom instructions on who to contact internally if they are confused? Can vary as simple as a "call HR" note to maybe a how-to document we would put together specifically for that client. 
 We were looking at the "nudge users with registration campaign" option, and though this is helpful it is beforehand. I know the actual prompts from Microsoft will walk them through it, though looking at option to add even more specifics if clients need more direction than MS article offers.

 It used to be you'd want TWO diff accounts. One you use daily, and one that has all the rights (domain admin, etc) that you'd use for special occasions to make changes. 
 Other recommendations are getting away from two accounts and using only one account per tech, but they are delegated everything they need access to.
 When the techs go to a workstation to install or make changes to a pc, I don't want them using their "privileged" account for obvious reasons. All the sudden that machine, potentially with malware, has keys to the castle.
 Being a smaller shop, everyone does some admin stuff here and there. So a tech may have to add/remove users, change passwords, create a group policy, manage file/folder permissions, etc.
 I dont want to hinder their jobs and I def dont want to be called every time they come to a roadblock where they have no rights.
 What works for you?
 Do you still have Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins under the Builtin\Administrators group?
 Are your privileged accounts a member of domain admins?
 Do you push out security groups to workstations that your techs are a member of? Is that their privileged account or regular account?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! We have a bunch of mobile devices that operate on a private 4G network (VLAN 405, 10.1.18.x/24). Long-story short, these devices transmit/access sensitive info and we'd like to make sure their traffic is handled as such. We are setting up a vendor VPN server that will encrypt traffic between those devices and the traffic's destination. The VPN configures an always-on virtual NIC and virtual IP on these devices; the assignment pool can be any of our choosing.
 Our firewall has a subinterface for VLAN 405, which is on a /30 network with the cellular provider's router. That then communicates with any devices on 405. My question is, if these devices now get fancy new virtual IPs from a completely different range (let's say 192.168.1.0), how will traffic flow be affected? Will I need to create a new VLAN and/or subinterface in addition to new access rules in order for traffic from these devices to continue to be allowed? Or can I just configure access rules to allow the new range on the existing subinterface? My apologies if this is a trivial question, I feel like the answer is on the tip of my tongue while also feeling thoroughly confused.

 ​
 update: I really appreciate getting me to lean back towards update everything. (So sorry to folks who maintain WSUS.) good thing Azure Automation and Log analytics exists. I'll entrust Microsoft for drivers and not look back, going to the vendor page should a problem to troubleshoot arise to get their copy of the drive.

 The host responded 4 times to 4 TCP SYN probes sent to destination port 24567 using source port 53. However, it did not respond at all to 4 TCP SYN probes sent to the same destination port using a random source port. We use CloudFlare as our CDN
 When I test using tcping it shows both port 53 and 24567 both being closed. The report is stating that the source port and destination are different. How can I test similiarly to the scan with source and destination ports different?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team has been tasked with blocking traffic between wireless clients. For our local sites this has been fairly simple as we can enable P2P blocking for the group of APs and be done with it. Unfortunately for Flex Connect sites, this function only works on a per AP basis and is a known limitation. This means that a client on AP1 cannot talk to another client on AP1, but can talk to a client on AP2.
 I've been experimenting a bit with private Vlans as I have a theory that if the APs are in isolated Vlans then they cannot talk to each other and the P2P block should work for the APs themselves, but testing has been slow and there's doubts this could work for our environment on a larger scale. 
 Curious to hear what solutions your teams have come up with to enable client isolation. 
 Thanks!

I could be using the wrong terminology so feel free to correct me! I am the only one in my dept, and I have 2 and a half years of IT experience.

 I have a few printers & wyze cams that I want on their own network, along with business owner laptops and maybe manager devices. For this I was using a netgear 4 port with wifi which works great since I have 4 hardwired (ethernet) printers in total. I may need to add a printer soon.
 I have a separate Linksys wifi router that I use for guest wifi, but it has no QoS as far as I can tell.. I really need to bandwidth limit this somehow, because modern devices and laptops are saturating my 100/10 Spectrum business cable to the point that music streaming is glitching out.
 I'm looking at Ubiquiti but everything in the stack that would serve my needs is sold out? wtf? Tp-Link omada and a secure router seems to be another route. I just need a simple setup with QoS on guest wifi and reliability and guaranteed bandwidth for actual biz needs.
 What hardware can I get actually order and get right now that won't break the bank and will stand up to 12+ hours a day of medium to light use?

 I just reached a new level of Bash proficiency. I've been trying to learn more Bash "carving" using awk/sed/cut/head/tail. So, with very little Googling, I just used a grep/awk/sort/uniq/grep -Ev combo to search a DNS server log, only output a few of the most relevant columns, and remove as much clutter as possible. Here's the sanitized version for those who are curious:
  grep 192.168.2O4.263 /var/log/server.log | awk '{print $4,$5,$6}' | sort | uniq | grep -Ev 'google|gstatic|cloudflare|stripe|wpengine|youtube|doubleclick|instagram|facebook|twitter|tiktok|fontawesome|in.gov|live.com|ytimg|zdassets|zendesk|bing|skype|microsoft|office.net|office.com|msedge|office365|windows.net|azure' 
 It was pretty fun to chip away at the rock to find the gems hidden beneath.
 Oh, man! I'm still geeking out about it!

 If you could list a few that would be amazing. Just to clarify, it's not an Internet or a WAN connection, just a linked fire patch panel that links to comms rooms together via 100gbps Fibre.

 I posted here about a week ago regarding a design decision for a customer and got a lot of great feedback.
 Now, I been thinking about another aspect of the design and my brain won't let me understand the logic here, here is the design: https://imgur.com/gyI2ihY 
 Network setup: 
  
2 fortigates, HA active/passive. 
 2 switches, will form MLAG with the firewalls. Will also run VRRP and vPC between the switches.
 Three servers connected to both switches
 SVI:s (default gateways for the VLANs) will be terminated on the firewall
 Internet will terminate on the switches. 
 Only one ISP circuit, they will handoff two ports from their wan switch, each physical cable will be connected to each switch.

 Now to my question, since the SVI/gateways for the servers will be terminated on the firewall, how will I then configure the VRRP on the switches? The way I've been configuring VRRP before, I always configured the SVI:s and VRRP on the same "equipment" (switch/router etc) if that makes sense.. 
 So for example, let say we have vlan 200 and a subnet of: 10.200.10.0/24 and I want to configure VRRP on the switches:
 SW1:
 Interface vlan 200
 ip addr 10.200.10.1/24
 vrrp 1 ip 10.200.10.99
 vrrp 1 prio 120
 preempt
 etc... 
 SW2:
 Interface vlan 200
 ip addr 10.200.10.2/24
 vrrp 1 ip 10.200.10.99
 preempt
 etc...
 Now, this is if the SVI:s would be terminated on the switches. But I would like to terminate the SVI:s on the firewall and not on the switch. Taking that approach (terminating SVI:s on the firewall): from the switch, I will just create a L2 VLAN and trunk it to the firewall. 
 ​
 I know of course that I do not want to terminate the SVI:s on the firewall, I could just terminate the SVIs on the switch and then run VRRP on the switches as well, but I would like to know if what I ask is doable, if so, how and why? 
 I could overthink this but please, help me to understand it. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been semi-involved in a ticket related to the public facing phone number for one of our grocery stores. According to the ticket, the customer would call the liquor store (physically attached to the side of the grocery store but has a different address), but the call will be sent to the grocery store instead. The customer tried this a few times before eventually giving up and driving to the liquor store. This is when we finally got word of the issue. It turns out, this customer was calling 411, asking for [Business name], and getting routed to a register phone in the grocery store. The register phone would then automatically forward to the office since it's not able to take outside calls.
 ​
 So, my dear Sysadmins, I ask you....when was the last time you (or someone you know) used 411?

 The text also says this:
  
This is a general problem and can happen any time the sender does a write, which is smaller than the window scale factor.
  
What is that supposed to mean? If in the example instead of sending 40 bytes and then 5 bytes, you instantly sent 130 bytes (window scale factor 128), it would result in window retraction right?

 I am installing about 6 POE Reolink Security Cameras for my dad's restaurant.
 2 cameras will be mounted outside and 4 will be mounted inside.
 Based on some research, I am told to stay away from CCA material as they can cause issues with CCA cameras. Can anyone guide me which material I should get for my applications? The wiring will run in a drop ceiling and above a kitchen. Also I will probably have some short runs outside (maybe around 10-15ft) and we live in the midwest (USA) where it gets cold so do I need any specific type of cable material for that? Trying to stay in a budget so budget friendly options are appreciated but want to do it right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 I have a set of questions that i cant seem to find a detailed answer on so im hoping i might get some information here. In short im taking a 08R2-DC migrating to a Esxi 6.7 hosted WS2016 VM where i would like a "fresh start" on rearranging the older AD. 
 ​
 I currently have an active AD/Forest that im preparing for a migration over to Microsoft Server 2016, im in the process of cleaning up old objects and folders but im running into issues deleting items that haven't been active or used in quite some time. Im getting a "you do not have the sufficient privileges to delete "intern 15-16" or this is protected from accidental deletion - yet im currently using the domain/sysadmin account.
 This AD has seen several owners prior to my hire 5+ years ago and im trying to strip the AD down to everything minimal in the sense of active users, computers and basic object folder - not extra clutter. I feel getting the AD somewhat back to a fresh start would be easier in the long run, all the permissions and groups need to be revisited as there are groups for folders that a "S" would appear in what used to be a user - it annoys me.
 If i can confirm these arent marked for "accidental deletion" is there a way to remove them or even set back to default an AD object tree? I dont know if i can afford to create a new AD on the WS2016 or if its possible to migrate only specific workstations or users from the older DC. 
 ​
 I do plan on rebuilding all the file folders on the File Server with correct permissions moving forward but im trying to leave as much of the old infrastructure behind as i can without having to migrate over a potential issue. 
 ​
 ​
 TLDR; is there a effective way to cleanup old AD DS permissions and broken paths in AD to prepare for a Migration to WS2016 smoothly?

Do I give the vm a second ip and manage the vm from the vm subnet while the users access it from their subnet and either the host or the vm firewall blocks access to ssh or any unneeded ports to that service on the client subnet.
 Do I go to the firewall level and allow access to the services there. 
 Something I haven't mentioned.
  
I feel like it's the second option or something I haven't thought of not totally sold on the first option unless it's the way to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have set up a new printer (HP DesignJet T1700).
 It is installed on a Windows print server and I have installed the HP driver. (via TCP/IP-Port)
 I can run the driver on the print server when I open the printer settings.
 ​
 Now there is the phenomenon that some users install the printer and everything runs, others get only the "Microsoft enhanced Point and Print driver", even if I change this manually then, this driver remains selected anyway.
 Anybody got some print server experience and is familiar with the problem?
 Thanks for any pointers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked on a couple of local ISPs now and realized neither of them have a proper way to store equipment passwords, usually it is just a spreadsheet with all equipment login and passwords. This approach poses a security risk, given that if this one document is leaked, the entire network is compromised. Another problem I've seen is that usually they just distribute the admin password to everyone working on the NOC, and so we've encountered a few people doing misconfiguration and also the need to change the master password once that employee leaves the ISP. I've thought about implementing a Radius based approach, where every user would get their own login and password, but I do not know of any "radius manager" (let's call it that). So, what is the approach used by your company, what are the recommendations and what are the pros and cons of each method?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For background, I have been a Windows engineer for 20+ years at this point, all the way from helldesk up to consulting engineer with some architecting experience (its mainly infrastructure based but am expanding my skillsets). Currently I am working a lot with AWS and Azure technologies alongside my Windows experience. I have been messing with some Raspberry Pi devices at home (Pihole/Retropie) for a while and got it into my head to learn Linux to go alongside my Windows knowledge. I have been learning it in my downtime off and on for a while and had been enjoying it. 
 Recently we got a client who was using Linux and I was wanting to get more involved. I threw myself into the learning and last week I gained my CompTIA Linux+ certification. During this I realised that really enjoy working with the Linux OS. I am now getting involved with more Linux stuff at work and want to keep going on this side of things. I started thinking about what else is good from a corporate perspective for Linux qualifications. My current thoughts are Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator into Red Hat Certified Systems Engineer, but I don't know if there are other/better options than this?
 Thought I would ask you knowledgeable lot to see what opinions you can offer…

They have the label of "Private Document", but my understanding of Office 365 is a global admin can easily view, even outright modify any and all content, which is leaving me confused. The reason I ask is mainly because I make use of the storage space and other services provided for sometimes things not exactly strictly work related (hey, free and I'm not the one paying), so I want to get some clarification on that point.

 I'm helping a customer who currently has a NAS with a few network shared drives that are synced up to their respective sharepoint online communicationswebsites. The problem is that files are not synced down to the shared drive from sharepoint online, but files are uploaded automatically from the network drive to sharepoint online. 
 Is there anything to do about this, or would it be wiser to just close either sharepoint online or the network share down and tell the users to only use one of them?

 I have come across a problem I am trying to solve and am completely stumped by it. 
 Our estate is mostly Windows 10 ent 21H1. We have had multiple users report that our IT service desk webpage keeps opening itself randomly. 
 This morning, I went to see a user and do some digging. In front of me she started typing an email, pressed shift+A and the IT helpdesk web page opened. She closed it, and then went back to her email and pressed shift+A and the helpdesk did not open. Each user reporting the issue says the same thing. There is no consistency as to when it does it or what key combination causes it. 
 I have searched the registry for the domain of the helpdesk without the https:// or trailing slashes and nothing came up.
 I have checked all desktop shortcuts for keyboard shortcuts on the helpdesk shortcut, but the user did not even have any shortcuts to the helpdesk in their profile anywhere. 
 The user I was with went off on the ward to sort some bits out whilst I dug into the issue, and I asked the other user in the room if they had the same and they said they have had it happen randomly to. It happens on different computers and it does not matter if they use the ward generic account or their account, it happens either way. 
 ​
 Has anyone come across this or got any ideas as to where else I can have a look? The bit that has thrown me off is the keyboard combination that triggers it is not static. I am sure I have had this happen to myself as well.
 Thanks!

 So is exactly what the title says. This company took a dip in terms of not having their shit together on the customer care side of things as the person that was previously there fucked up bad (that was said to me in my 2nd interview) so now they want someone who will clearly know how to do the following :
  
Create an easy way of managing tickets
 
Create Documentation on what to do for each situation step by step (with flow charts of business processes if I can) and SOPS (standards operating procedures) 
 
Further refine their FAQs (so as to lower users logging tickets when they can just troubleshoot themselves & find a fix that way too instead of creating extra tickets.
 
Know how to utilize SharePoint in creating Response Templates
 
 In their words they simply want it to be a specific way that if 2 New people had to join the company under me, all I would have to do instead of helicopter-ing around them, is literally show them this system of documented procedures and what processes to follow in order to know what to say and who to go to for what information.
 I'm freaking out because whilst I have managed teams before I have never had to create any processes and document stuff.
  
Are there any easy Softwares out there to automate Documenting procedures and processes or make this easy to do (free ideally)? 
 
Are their any easy resources to easily learn how to create or custom make SharePoint into a central point of information? 
 
How do I wing this post? Any words of encouragement will be really welcomed, I can feel the imposter syndrome tingling lol
 
 Any and all advice is welcomed too! 
 Thank you so much for reading! 
 I will reply as soon as I get a chance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My business asked me to create and develop a new Microsoft system which usually requires a Microsoft partner to integrate and lots of money. 
 I went away learnt the system, created multiple integrations with dashboards and workflows and mimic their current system they used so that everything looked similar. 
 I’ve had no support in building it out as they did not want to spend the money. I created a bunch of processes that are connected to the new system which have been successful. 
 I eventually rolled the system out to the whole business, I was task to train 100 people individually, and also teach the internal staff how to use the system. 
 The business has now done a backflip on their decision and realised that the usability of it is too complex and is wanting to pull the project. 
 When I rolled out the project two weeks after I was given multiple project leads that the business deemed important. I felt that during that time I was not able to give the respect my work deserved over the last 12 months. 
 The company realised they have under resource me, but now I feel like the last 12 months have been a complete waste of time. I feel like I’ve been set up to fail. 
 Don’t get me wrong I learnt a lot of stuff. But now almost all of it won’t come to fruition because they’ve decided this is not the right direction for the business after launch. 
 Any advice? Has anyone else been through something like this?

 ​
 In a Company i Support we get some really strange errors from our clients.
 Suddenly after a restart the Search bar and the Windows Start ( Logo) wont work or is not clickable anymore. I cant see any point that triggers this behavior ( Updates or so ) . These Notebooks are Intune controlled. All are rolled out on the same profile. 
 In the last 6 month we hat like 6 Clients with this problem . If you log in with another account on the same machine everything works fine. The only solution to it by now is to clean reinstall Windows.
 Does anyone had/has the same issue or maby knows a fix to this ? 
 Thanks in advance.

 (Diagram) In our network we have two facilities and a fist full of remote cabinets. Every cabinet has a link to each facility, and both facilities have a connection to each other. Each facility has its own connection to a separate carrier and we have one ASN. The traffic originating from these cabinets must reliably make their way to the internet, with the key risk being a link from cabinet to one facility going down.
 Me, a caveman, thinks I should spec out the high level as:
  
Install layer 3 switches in the cabinets and facilities. Set up RIP.
 Install BGP routers at the facilities, set up VRRP and BGP.
  
Is this the right mindset? Are there smarter ways to handle this?

Obviously the two vendors are wildly different when you look at price-for-performance... but taking price out of the equation, why is it that we generally prefer Palo Alto around these parts?

 I currently have to buildings that I am trying to bridge with a P2P wireless network ( 50 meters ). Both sites are running their network without any current VLANS set. I am trying to work out how to get the default vlan on each site onto its on VLAN at the remote site so I can configure the WiFI Ap's on each site to have a SSID for the other building.
 Site 1 Site 2 VLAN 1 <===> VLAN 1000 VLAN 2000 <===> VLAN 1
 I have managed switches at both sites. Ideally i would like to have an additional subnet at each site and route between the two locations but I am told one of the applications in use does not support server communication on a different subnet so I am stuck with a odd layer 2 stretch situation.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on how i should approach this?
 Thanks

 I want to connect another n9k (will eventually be another vpc pair but budget/ supply chain issues). The other n9k is at another data center (same company as colo, fiber exists between colo and let’s call it dc3).
 The 2 pairs are ebgp peered physically and ibgp peered between vpc members. 
 Plan was to use data center providers network between colo and dc3, add third n9k and have all 5 switches meshed in one /28 segment so we can run vxlan to the 3rd site. 
 As soon as the server provider started making changes to one leg of the fiber, all 4 existing n9k switches errored out UDLD. Ports wouldn’t come back up until the transceivers were physically disconnected and reconnected.
 Went all around the world with TAC. They blame the transceivers. Cisco branded ones are on the way and I intend to try again with the new ones; however, do I disable UDLD on the affected interfaces before I try it? These 2 diverse path runs connect the Colo back to hq and redistribute routes to eigrp to (a much larger networks core) and to the internet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to make sense of a weird issue we’re seeing. A group of client machines reach out to a server on a TCP Port. The application recently stopped working, and analyzing the network traffic reveals that there is no response back from the server. Just seeing a multitude of SYNs from the clients, and never any SYN+ACK from the server.
 We set a SPAN up directly on the server’s ports and see the SYNs egressing towards the server, and no SYN+ACK ingressing, we effectively proved traffic is making it all the way to the server, and the server is not responding to the traffic.
 After a while the ticket comes back to us saying the app owner had a call with the support vendor and they found nothing wrong and wanted the network checked for blocks.
 Same situation on second look, all SYNs no responses. This time we did some troubleshooting on the server itself and NETSTAT showed an anomaly. It showed ESTABLISHED connections with all of the clients trying to reach it, on the port they’re sending on…
 How is this possible? For NETSTAT to show ESTABLISHED on a TCP connection, it means there had to be a 3-way handshake, right? Or will it show established just if it receives SYN and (thinks) it sent out SYN+ACK?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I got a troubleshooting case, where a new Juniper ELS switch replaces an old Cisco switch that connects to a Cisco 877 router.
 The traffic was not forwarded properly due to: - IP address of the SVI on the 877 is bound to the MAC address of its first interface (Fa0) - Both the Cisco switch and the new Juniper switch connects to the 877's Fa2 port (cable swapping only) - The Cisco switch managed to learn the MAC address of the SVI - The Juniper switch only learned the MAC address of the real interface (Fa2), causing all possible ARP replies to and ARP requests for the 877's SVI IP failed to be forwarded properly
 I have tried setting static MAC (of the SVI) on the Juniper's port connecting to the 877, however the traffic still fails to flow.
 Have yet tried static ARP on the hosts behind the Juniper.
 What else should I consider in this case?
 
 One more thing I have tried, is that setting an IRB interface on the Juniper switch (192.0.2.3/24). Still results in a failure

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am a one-man IT department that handles the assets of a small scientific supply company (~30 employees), owned jointly by four different people. I've been doing fine on my own, but recently, the company hired a new warehouse and shipping specialist to handle shipping and receiving packages as well as to keep track of inventory for the whole company. 
 In about three months, this person has engineered a situation where now the company is dependent on her to run the business: every time we need the get the materials to build the stuff we make, we need to go through her to get it. She did it under the guise of improving company operations and keeping better track of inventory, however, I strongly suspect she is far more interested in gaining control and power within the company. I am extremely creeped out by her. 
 Now she's is targeting my department. She has been demanding that I hand over my inventory of computers, servers, networking equipment, etc. I think she wants to engineer the same scenario with me, where if I want to deploy a new computer/server, I have to go through her first. So far I've resisted these demands, mainly due to security, as I don't want the information of our sensitive IT infrastructure to fall in the wrong hands. But the other main reason is that I'm just flat out creeped out by this person. 
 I've been with the company for longer than she has, and I have enough clout with two of the owners who are siding with me. Two of the owners are siding with her. This is a very interesting dilemma I'm finding myself in, and I wanted to ask my fellow sysadmins on what are your thoughts? Is it customary for non-IT people to manage IT inventory? Should I fight this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm very excited about the prospect, as there's a lot on paper about it that I would enjoy. But I'm wondering what it's actually like from those who've done it before.
 From what it was explained to me, the job would involve a lot of meeting with c-level management and senior technical members of the customer's network team, helping to understand their environment and making recommendations/designs of how a specific vendor's product would help. I'd also then be responsible for creating and giving presentations about what our recommendations are, creating detailed designs and implementation plans and then be the primary technical POC during proof-of-concept implementations. There would be lots of client interaction, lots of face time, and at least 20% travel with the rest being fully remote. Lots of creating documentation & designs, and then sometimes assisting (at a high level) with implementation.
 All of this sounds great to me, at least on paper. It's the stuff that I love doing, without as much of the drudgery of day-to-day tickets. I spend my entire day already elbow-deep in this specific vendors products anyway, so if anything I'd have to go even deeper into their product offerings across the board.
 The compensation numbers being tossed about are . . . uh, generous to say the least. And that doesn't hurt the appeal.
 My questions are:
 1. What are these jobs actually like, and what makes someone good at them? 2. What's the best way to communicate my soft/non-technical abilities that I think would make me really good at this, such as being a good presenter, public speaker, and explainer of technical topics, without sounding like a blow-hard?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a guy that connects to a meraki client VPN - once he connects he's had all sorts of strange issues. To start out, and it might be the issue, whoever setup this network set it in a public range. 192.158.x.x
 Once he connects, he can ping the servers ip address and it gets a response (192.158.x.9) but he cannot Telnet to the same address.
 I'm on his home computer remotely, once he connects to the VPN, i lose my connection and don't get it back until he disconnects. He also can't get to the website to initiate a new connection but CAN still connect to other things on the internet.
 I ran wireshark on the server and can see the ping requests and replies but I see NOTHING when attempted a telnet connection. I've completely turned off the firewall on both machines to see if thats the issue, and it didn't help. 
 a "powershell test-netconnection" to the server on port 23 fails
 I've connected to his VPN using the same settings from my computer and I can telnet to the server just fine.
 I've connected to his VPN using the same settings from his old home computer and I can telnet to the server just fine.
 I've restarted and ran windows updates and it still doesn't work. I checked the firewall rules on the meraki and its set to allow all. There are some OLD 1:1 nat rules having to do with port 23 but that shouldn't have anything to do with a vpn connection.
 ​
 I'm stumped. I don't know why this machine wont work and a machine on the same home network works fine connecting the same way. I've spent 4 hours on this so I'm sure I've missed some things in this write up

I've added the DigiCert root and issuer certificates to our NPS server, created the RADIUS client and connection request policy, and set the network policy to use the NAS port wireless auth method EAP other certificate, and set the Issuer CA as the cert for the EAP. However, I'm currently struggling to find a guide on how to create a Wi-Fi profile on Windows 11 that will pass the correct device certificate to the AP and NPS servers. I'm also wondering how to maintain certain functionalities from the previous username and password authentication, such as the ability to place devices in different VLANs based on their Active Directory group membership. One suggestion I received was to use unique OUs in the certificate and have the NPS server validate and use these for network policies.

 I have been advised that I need to implement port based security in a secure enclave, and recently got a Netgear M4300. 
 I have a L2 network with 8 clients and a management computer, and was hoping to achieve this just using mac address ACLS i.e. only the mac addresses of the existing machines connected to that L2 network can communicate, anything MAC not listed is dropped.
 Is this possible - i'd rather not make this setup more complicated?
 Thanks

The current network uses AD and has an on-prem domain controller, but we are completely re-doing everything. The caveat here is that my manager is adamant against using Active Directory or Azure. The alternatives he has suggested would help manage user sign on to devices, but do not help with the more technical aspects (like group policy to disable USB ports, etc.).
 My manager also wants to move a lot of stuff to AWS, so if there is an AWS service that is like a cloud-based Domain Controller (aside from setting up a Windows Server EC2 instance) that can manage on-prem devices that might be "acceptable" for him.

I feel like these days students must be pressured hard into cyber programs at universities. As important as security is to me and our companies IT operations department, in a new person I would prefer a traditional IT degree and certs such as Azure, CCENT, Net+, Linux+, Sec+. yeah you know how to use Snort and Kali linux to do web app penetration, and can hack some aspects of AD, but do you really understand the fundamentals of AD, o365, networking, linux, Vmware&Cloud, or do you just plug in scripts your instructor gives you. I think colleges may be taking advantage of students, making them think they will land some high flying pen testing position, then they find themselves falling back and applying to sysadmin and wonder why they cannot land a job.

 With modern access switching gear (Cisco 9200, Juniper EX3400, etc.) is there any risk of a DDoS attack affecting the switching gear if I have my two internet connections for a branch land on the access switch before going to our router? It can be assumed the internet connection is less than 100mbps.
 I was proposing shift to doing this as opposed to landing the internet links directly on the router but my supervisor is concerned about DDoS risks?
 Most of our internet links are less than 50mbps symmetric, though there are a few slightly bigger circuits, but I can't fathom how this could possibly be an issue on a switch with a data rate of 300+gbps / 250mbps throughput. Any input/thoughts/resources would be appreciated!

 So over the last week i've used ChatGPT successfully to:
  
Help me configure LACP, BGP and vlans via the Cisco iOS CLI
 
Help me write powershell, rust, and python code
 Help me write ansible playbooks
 Help me write a promotional letter to my employer
 Help me sleep train my toddler 
 Help improve my marriage
 Help come up with meal ideas for the week that takes less than 30 minutes to create
 Helped me troubleshoot a mechanical issue on my car
  
Given how successfully it was with the above I decided to see what arguably the world most advanced AI to have ever been created wasn't able to do........ so I asked it a Microsoft Licensing question (SPLA related) and it was the first time it failed to give me an answer.
 So ladies and gentlemen, there you have it, even an AI model with billions of data points can't figure out what Microsoft is doing with its licensing.
 Ironically Microsoft is planning on investing 10 Billion into this project so fingers crossed, maybe the future versions might be able to accomplish this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While interviewing 3 months ago for Cloud Engineering type positions it was a clear expectation of mine that wfh was a requirement. Want me in the office a few days a week for an intro period (if they’re close enough) sure thing, no problem.
 So I’ve been going in 1-3 days a week for the past 3 months. As I’m approaching my 90 days, I brought up that I’ll be switching over to full wfh. My manager was like “well….the board walked through the office the other day and really didn’t like all of the empty chairs, so they’re pulling back a bit on the wfh conversions for newer employees”. He noted we’ll just have to submit a conversion form and hope it gets approved.
 Now, I’ve never been one to like hold something over someone’s head, but this position had 140 applicants, took them 6 months to fill, and it was me.
 We have an additional new hire starting with my same title frommmm Texas….sooooo I’m being discriminated against because I just happen to live close?
 I want to approach my request as respectfully as possible, but at the same time, I’ll leave. 140K a year or not, I’ll find somewhere else. 
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be a rookie question. Please be gentle.
 Currently have a ~20km link that has a 40 km QSFP+ transceiver connected at the far end. When a Optical Light Meter is connected it reports -2.8 dbm, but local connected QSFP+ reports -8.2 dbm. Close to a 6 dbm difference.
 Should you trust the reported light levels received at the SFP/QSFP transceivers? (i.e. show interface diagnostic optics etc...)Or the reported light levels reported by a connected Optical Light Meter?
 edited: fixed a few details on the distance on transceiver.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ideally, I'd like to run esxi and multiple VMs on top of it. My current hardware is HPE ProLiant Gen 9/10 servers. Each of these servers have 8 bays for hard disks. I've got a mixture of SATA SSDs, SAS HDDs of various sizes in them. 
 And recently the disks started failing, mostly the SAS HDD disks. And I assumed that they must be bad so was planning to replace them with SATA SSDs but I realise after a quick google search, I may have been on the wrong path. And I asked a question about the disk failures here and the answers only provoke more questions in my mind. 
 As a novice who just started out on system administration, I'm now wondering what's the best disks out there for what I'm trying to do and what's the best RAID configuration for what I'm trying to achieve?
 I understand that there are countless ways of doing what I want to do. I also understand that if I opt for external storage (with vSANs?) I might be better off as the resources are pooled together, I'd like to understand how I can do it better with what I have (by may be replacing just the disks) and also a future plan when the budget allows to strengthen my infrastructure. 
 A colleague recently told me that disks fail for whatever reason and if they're in warranty you just claim from supplier or you buy a new one. Although arbitrary, it doesn't sit well with me. There must be reasons and best practices that the industry follow. I'm only trying to find that out. Can someone please help me out? 
 Thanks in advance.

 Can anyone suggest a simple piece of software that could log their ID's when they log in and record the amount of time the machine was in use by them log it and allow me to review that data say after a week to find the culprits?

We've already had to whitelist IE on this particular computer, but the upcoming changes suggest it's gonna get yote by Microsoft soon.
 The buttons are so they can quickly order supplies et al, and also logs them into their UPS account for them. They do not have the login details anymore, and UPS support has been... less than stellar. (Downright awful.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins. I work for an MSP subcontracted to a customer and I'm struggling to find a solution to managing access for the guest wireless.
 The customer have a Wi-Fi network set up for guest use using Meraki NAT so it doesn't touch the LAN.
 Previously they had a preshared key that was given out to guests who came to their office. This worked for a while until people started complaining it was mega slow. I log on to Meraki cloud manager and find there was more than 100 devices connected to this SSID. This network is also speed and bandwidth limited to preserve resources for LAN traffic on the APs. It looks like people had been using the PSK to add their own personal devices to the guest wireless thereby slowing it down.
 Before Christmas, the password was changed and it was decided it it was only visible to IT staff who enter it into guest devices when they arrive, but this is far from ideal for a number of reasons.
 I have also suggested changing the password every month and only giving the password to the receptionist who then gives it to the guest. But there are concerns from management the receptionist will just give it out to anyone and we are back where we were before.
 I did look at the Meraki sponsorship option for the guest wireless but this has no reporting feature and no way to authorise specific people who can be sponsors. Again, this is a problem because people will just start authorising their own devices, with no way of seeing who is doing this.
 All the APs are various Cisco Meraki models.
 How are you guys managing guest wireless in your workplaces?

 Issue: The issue appeared two days ago, every attempt to log on steam application failed with the given error "failed to update" due to connectivity parameters. at first I attempted to check the diagnose, but there were no indication of connection time out whatsoever. Some other applications that share significance or that rely on the internet connection also can't update or work online while some can. There were couple of weird things that left me puzzled, I tried to get on google chrome, while it let me access the internet, could download stuff on it, However, when I tried to get on Mozila or other indie browsers i ended up with "No Internet" error. When I used Jdownloader for example on google drive I couldn't access it but when I used bittorrent I could download stuff from it. So through trial-and-error approach my leads were to try and stop dns client via group policy which was impossible because I couldn't even click on the stop or pause button. I also attempted to flash ipconfig via cmd, renew it as well but it didn't work. What else I tried was to controlset1 and change its value to 0 in the regedit, I also attempted to manually enter the proxy 8.8.8.8 ip in the internet settings, none of it worked. So I'm truly hoping that I won't need to reboot my pc fully once again. (I have to note that my firewall, avast were shut down during the process.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I am seeing some very strange behavior when changing an IS-IS metric.
 The metric change is happening on a interface connecting to another DC router. The connection is to a transit router that provides internet connectivity to the connected DC.
 So, metric change on R1(DC2) connected to transit router (DC1)
 When I change the IS-IS metric on the interface of the router, it is causing what appears to be routing issues for a customer in DC1. The customer route to its destination does not pass through or depend upon routing in DC2 and connects directly to the transit in DC1. Traceroutes before and after change show this.
 So, how can a IS-IS metric change on a router interface have any bearing at all on a couple of routes through a completely separate infrastructure?
 I'm stumped :)

 I found fraud in my org and reported it up the pecking order. 
 Nothing changed for a few weeks, but then Friday I get a call. they’re dismantling my team of 5, and I am now the sole owner of the system with fraudulent data. 
 As of Friday, I initiated a data freeze in that system until those that made the fraudulent requests fixes the inputs on their end. 
 Prior to this, I was just the oversight on this specific system, to report to my manager whenever something differed from our standard. 
 Am I being scapegoated? Are they promoting me? Should I run, or ask for more money?

I have a RAID0 disk that I boot esxi from and I'm scared to lose that disk (like I lost another boot disk). I realise now that I should have at least specified RAID1 so I'm planning to do that but I need advice on the best way to go about this. The current boot disk is a HDD and I'd like to move to SSDs. How would I just failover to the new RAID1 configuration without issues? Thankfully I have empty bays where I can plug the new disks in for this server so hopefully this is not too difficult? 
 I also have a RAID5 configuration on a different server where I've exhausted all the storage bays and one of the disks failed. Now, the problem is that all these disks are HDDs. I know that I cannot setup an array of HDD & SSD in one so how do I go about replacing these? To be specific, I have 8 1TB HDD disks on this server and since then I've been able to purchase 1TB/4TB SSDs disks so I'm trying to find the best way to upgrade/fix the issues as I've found HDDs to be less reliant. 
  
Thanks in advance.

 I've just been charged with managing my companies SharePoint directory. A bit of context, we are a small Construction company running in different states. We have all of our construction job files via SharePoint. These are creating using Team Sites that have a Job number associated with them.
 This is a two part question:
  
Is it possible to create a SharePoint site that lists the active sites in a list/directory of sorts?
 If so, is it possible to seperate that list to specific states and have each sharepoint site for that state listed under it?

 We have evaluated as alternatives:
  
Cisco WSA (previously Ironport): My brain starts bleeding when I look at the GUI, NEXT!
 FortiProxy: Does not seem to be a very popular product but it might do what we want although we probably have to restructure our ACLs and the price tag looks +/- ok
  
Any other alternatives coming to mind for stuff that is readily available in EU?
 Reqs:
  
HA (active-passive is ok)
 exceptions to group-based rules must be easy to implement (e.g. add/remove categories for a user/group)
 Category/URL filter
  Application Control (e.g. make sure that protocol used is HTTP if that is what is expected, and not someone tunnelling SSH)
  SSL inspection
  HTTP basic auth (LDAP bind) yes, LDAP bind
  some people need to authenticate, others are just authd by their IP range
  also supports FTP/SSH filtering
  (optionally) can be used to protect DNS service i.e. filter DNS to the Internet
  
No, squid is not a solution. We need some enterprisey product with a GUI, "official" block lists and all that.

 For the internet they do not use DHCP but put manual IPv4. We do that so that people don't come with their own PC and start using the bandwidth. I've heard that for DHCP you can only filter using MAC adress but might as well stays in manual.
 My question is can DHCP ONLY gives an adress to devices in our domain?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to create a network of linux vms for running some workloads like databases, applications, monitoring infrastructure.
 In a previous iteration of such a network, the vms were not connected to the internet and therefore did not require any kind of firewall etc.
 Now, requirements have changed and I need to connect the network to the internet. The datacenter hosting my infrastructure has simple virtual networks and a simple firewall which can be configured on that network.
 Because the amount of servers I have to manage will now grow beyond 20, I can't keep using IPs for everything as obviously this will probably lead to misconfigurations etc.
 My main question: Is OPNSense an appropriate choice for my scenario? It seems that I will be able to use not only its firewalling and NAT-capabilities, but also its DHCP and DNS features in order for me to move from IPs to proper hostnames. As a hardcore-beginner in networking, I am not able to assess if this a typical, valid use case or I abuse a system that is not for that.
 Disclaimer: I am a total networking noob. I mainly work as programmer and have worked a lot with Kubernetes (as a user, not cluster admin) and therefore know the theoretical backgorund of all involved protocols and the OSI layers, but I lack the practical experiance...
 Thank you for your time and opinion ;)

 So the task is to make site-to-side VPN tunnel from Fortigate with static IP to the Cisco that has Dynamic IP. These devices locates on different countries.
 Location A:
 - Fortigate 100E
 - Static WAN IP
 Location B:
 -Cisco IR809G
 -Dynamic WAN IP
 - LTE network
 ​
 How should i configure this? Cisco using DDNS and Fortigate as normal ? 
 Thanks for responses.

 TL;DR: I ran a scan against the three million most visited domains and discovered that the Ukrainian MoD, MIT, <REDACTED> University, University of Miami, along with 1000+ other domains had mistakenly used the “+all” SPF mechanism at the end of their respective SPF records – effectively meaning any public IP address can send SPF authenticated emails on their behalf. These results were validated through emails I sent to myself from a select number of the affected domains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a Unix-based environment, when transferring data via rsync to a remote host (via ssh), the identity of a known remote host is verified by checking if the public-key fingerprint matches what is found in known_hosts. A somewhat analogous practice in a Windows-based environment is transferring data to a remote computer or server via robocopy (e.g., robocopy .\local\path \\secondhost\another\path ...). In the latter scenario (for sake of simplicity, let's say on the same network), is there an equivalent protocol/procedure that is used/can be used to verify the identity of the remote host/share? Or are the DNS responses normally assumed to be trustworthy?

 Getting rid of MSP so have to manage IT now. That would involve getting network and performance monitoring, security monitoring, helpdesk etc.
 Mostly migrated to AWS, everything Linux based, dockerized mostly or SaaS. Migrated from MS SQL server to PostgreSQL.
 We have reduced our on-prem VM footprint to 6 VMs (VMware ESXi 7) on two Dell R730 and one R620 servers. Among the six VMs are two domain controllers. One is 2008 R2 and another one is 2016. All FSMO roles are on 2008 server. Each DC also has DNS, DHCP roles as well. We have Office 365 Business Basic, on-prem sharepoint server, quickbooks running on a 2016 Windows Server.
 End goal is to have SSO with AWS and other SaaS services like Jira Project tracking, Bitbucket, Mimecast, Office 365. I want to use AD FS for this. Is this the best way to go for SSO ?
 Definitely replacing the 2008 DC to 2022 (fresh install) but should I upgrade 2016 server to 2022 as well? Are there any better approaches to architecture here? I am open to better solutions.

 Cloud ain’t cheap..so maybe just having a redundant outgoing network connection works? But that’s not always a clean way to do things either. Server goes down = no after-hours alerts of issues.

We have spent a lot of time identifying sites that don't work in Edge native mode and are required to be added to the enterprise site mode list. We have identified many sites and most work fine in IE11 mode. So, this is working well for us.
 However, we have no visibility of how many users are still launching IE11 directly potentially due to a site not working in edge. We would like to be able to audit where anyone is launching IE11 and find out why then remediate if required. We tried using MECM Software Metering but found that when a site loaded in edge uses IE11 mode then iexplore.exe is launched making this worthless.
 I've reached out to Microsoft, but they just suggested we use the Disable IE Policy and wait for users to complain. Not ideal in a hospital environment.
 Any suggestions would be appreciated.

 Ive inherited a new network that’s just been setup, with a new windows DHCP server. I did not setup the firewall but did setup the DHCP server.
 We have all our subnet/VLAN scopes imported to windows DHCP. For example, wired (20), wireless (30), security (50), etc. 
 However, that leaves our APs. Whomever initially setup the firewall configured all the APs to the DHCP server on the Palo. 
 What is the best practice in this scenario? Create a new sub interface/VLAN for the APs and migrate scope to windows DHCP? Put them on the wired Vlan? Or get all DHCP off the firewall and create a new scope just for APs?
 Perhaps the engineer setting up the FW was using the Palo dhcp until the new dhcp server was active?
 We would preferably don’t want the FW running dhcp. Is there a technical reason why the APs were put on the firewall DHCP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, long story short. 
 We’re a new carrier that was reassigned a 16-bit ASN by ARIN. 
 Fine and dandy, until we see that there is an IRR record for a /24 being announced by Level 3 still. Level 3 is Lumen (CTL).
 I called their Tier 3 support and their Pro NOC. Not a single person knew what BGP or an ASN meant. 
 Trying to explain BGP and an ASN to the highest possible support at Lumen is ridiculous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to figure out why a FD150 credit card processing machine can't connect and obtain an IP address via Wi-Fi on my network. It works using a cabled connection. The network diagram is here. When I try to connect to Wi-Fi it never obtains an IP address. I can, however, turn on the hotspot on my Pixel 6 Pro and it will connect. The hotspot is set for WPA2-Personal
 ​
  
The FD150 supports WPA-AES, WPA-TKIP, and WPA2-AES. I’m not trying to use anything other than WP2-AES
 The WAPs support WPA2-Personal, WPA3-Personal, and WPA-Enterprise. I don’t have/want a RADIUS server, so enterprise is out. I’ve set the WAPs to use WPA2-Personal.
 My believe is that WPA2-Personal and WPA2-AES are the same thing. WPA2-Personal uses AES.
 I’m trying to connect the credit card machine to VLAN30. Other PCs using that VLAN via a different SSID, but same WAP have no problem obtaining an IP address and accessing the internet. I have tried the FD150 connecting to the same SSID as the other PCs – still doesn’t work.
  
I’m working on a method to Wireshark the Wi-Fi packets but finding an adapter that supports monitor mode is not as easy as I thought it would be.
 Am I wrong about the equivalence of WPA2-AES and WPA2-Personal
 Does anybody see anything I’m doing wrong that I’ve missed? I’m sure I’ve forgotten some detail
 Anybody have a recommendation for a Windows or Linux Wi-Fi adapter that supports monitor mode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, NIST standardized new algorithms to replace RSA and EC / DH (the public key algorithms that will break easily once quantum computers are stable). Has anyone been able to get an answer from MS about when AD Certificate Services will implement anything quantum-resistant?
 At preset, YubiKeys with the native smart card functionality of Windows is the most effective way to require multi-factor for logging in as a domain administrator (common insurance thing), without off-prem dependencies and basically no cost beyond the keys themselves. Smart cards depend on PKI so they need to be updated to post-quantum eventually.
 Once RSA and EC become unsafe and/or forbidden, this could be a widespread issue, especially if Microsoft decides to disregard NIST standards in AD CS to leverage this to force everyone into a full AAD migration. Has anyone been able to find any hints about their intentions yet?

 But my issue is they're sending from amazonses and other legitimate providers, seemingly from domains that appear legitimate but aren't, so as not to end up on any blacklists. I've had about 20 different domains offering various "investment advice" and each has a barebones website, so far I've had The Daily Recap, SMHNews, Manhatten Winner, Jeff Clark, Market Minute, etc etc etc... if I even touch the unsubscribe button we get 4 more of these emailing the user.
 So far I've been trying to find commonalities between the emails but they all use large providers and change their wording just slightly (ie "This ad is sent by..." to "This opportunity is sent by...")
 I've got some pretty aggressive regex which catches 90-100% of it most of the time but then come the wave of new "providers". I hard bounce in the hope Amazon/Sendgrid/etc will shut these accounts down but to no avail, I think they have created 99% of their own accounts so a 1% bounce rate doesn't affect them?

 Could you just put a tone on the copper coming from the office and just use the buttset to look for the tone through all the CCBs?

 I'd like to connect them directly to the PA. Currently port 3 is set as an L3 port and holds the gateway IP address. Do I need to set both ports as L2? Or both as L3?

I've followed the config guidelines provided by HP and PacketFence, made allowances in our firewall for 1812 and 1813 which allows the communication. PacketFence is tied into our AD for authenticating against.
 The issue I'm seeing is that when a user tries to authenticate, it accepts regardless of the password, but only for my team's groups user names. 
 My experience and education has been primarily network hardware related and some monitoring software, and my server background is limited so I'm kind of floundering here for a solution.

 ​
 What's the best disk cloning tool that doesn't cost the earth? what do you use and recommend?
 Looking to replace about 10 mechanical hard drives with SSD's. I suspect bitlocker is enabled on most of them.
 Ill probably have 3-4 a month after that too for a good time.
 In descending order i want to
 Deal with Bitlocker especially where the user has no idea that it's turned on or what it is 
 Direct clone a users drive including permissions etc
 use it to deploy a windows 10 image
 Create backup snapshots (nice to have)
 Verify drive health (nice to have)
 ​
 any suggestions? Free is good but I'll take a paid bit of software if it's extremely easy to use
 ​
 thanks in advance

 I created an ISO file to install windows on different PC with different pre-install APPS. the thing comes here:
 I created a second ISO file the same way but it has grown in storage. the first ISO has 11GB and the second 16 GB. How can i do it so that i'd be a normal ISO. 
 The steps were:
 1) i Installed windows 10 from iso to a VM,
 2) i Install some apps, and sysprep the VM
 3) Open with Windows PE, and create an Image of the disk. Windows.wim file was created.
 4) I turn the wim file into a ISO file. And that was it. 
 I read the sysprep doesnt eliminate users but I wanted to ask if it's possible that the increase in size is about the users.
 Can you help me?
 Thanks a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firstly, Background Info.
 So I'm working at a college as, debatably, the only IT guy and I've got 150 students who just started here. A whole bunch of them have Nintendo Switches and I also have one at hand, however they will not connect to the internet through our "WPA Personal" Ubiquiti SSID. (Nintendo Switches are simply incompatible with "WPA Enterprise" which we use for our main Wi-Fi network) They connect to the network with the password but throw back the message "Registration is required to use this network" when trying to connect to the internet. I HAVE done research but I can't find any actual solutions. Other Universities appear to collect MAC Addresses from the students and just add them manually which is no problem but I haven't the slightest idea where to do this after gathering the device's MAC Addresses.
 I think either our WatchGuard firewall or RADIUS is causing the problem but maybe I've missed a setting in the SSID setup I really don't know. I have full access to every server, everything. I just haven't a clue what to do with the Nintendo Switch's MAC Address to get it to connect to the internet :(
 Currently, I have a test "Nintendo" SSID on the nearest access point to me which I plan to use to troubleshoot the issue further. If I can get it to work here though I'll push it out to the other 80 access points.
 Willing to follow any guidance and answer any questions. I hope someone has come across this before. Mobile phones and computers have no issues connecting.
 P.S Let me know if there are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of thing...

 users computer is running windows 10.
 The emails end up correct in webmail, phone etc everytime 
 We have tried EVERYTHING.

 Same behaviour. 
 I've tried to check everything on the users Attirbutse, to see if there are any mismatch spelling, any wierd proxy adresses - nothing. Its all clean

 1) When I do a manual AzureAD join it using the users account, it creates the new profile as a local admin. Is this the right way of doing it but then just logging in as Global Admin and setting them back to standard user?
 I don't have a spare license just for a enrol type account, so think doing it as user is the only way.
 2) Since its a new profile for AzureAD does Forensit tool work for migrating? (like it does with domain accounts)
 3) What's the order in which this should be done? If I remove from the on prem domain first before AzureAD joining then we lose access unless I set local account

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So if the whole purpose of CG-NAT is to combat the lack of IPv4's why does it seemingly having its own firewall settings for port forwarding?
 Every customer on the ISP already has their own router and internal firewall for ports and of course like so many people that hate CG-NAT their own port forwarding rules, so why can't the Dynamic public address just have all ports open so that what ever traffic is coming through would work as if their was no extra layer...
 Am I missing a big chunk of how CG-NAT works here, are Ports a big part of how NAT works?
 so a follow up question... If CG-NAT Needs ports to translate from Public - WAN - Private Addresses why couldn't we send a packet with the private address alongside the Public one that the router can read thus allowing for private port forwarding rules to work through the Carrier Router
 Note: I'm a complete networking novice talking out my ass hoping I understand at least 30% of what I'm talking about... So please be gentle...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rather simple and also complicated matter I'm running out of ideas for, so here's the scoop;
 I have a few users with disabilities which impairs their ability to type on a keyboard and use a mouse, they can do it but very slowly but that isn't the issue. The issue is the Windows change password screen which obfuscates the password text, so whenever they're trying to enter a new password they lose track of what they've typed in because they can't see the characters, get frustrated, and give up.
 So what I'm looking for are any "Alternate" methods for user password updates?
 I should add this is on an Active Directory Domain, and despite being a very big corporation actively block Azure Active Directory domain join so that rules those features out. We do use Okta for SSO and Identity, which in theory could work with password writeback but it's still a bit cludgy as the local computer must sync with the domain while connected via VPN, meaning an account re-login.
 (Under normal circumstances this would be a non-issue, but I wouldn't be making this post if it was)
 The very minimum I've got working as a happy medium is to enable Windows Hello PIN logon for their local machine, but that doesn't help when it comes to their corporate AD account and any screen/menu where a password cannot be easily entered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got failover cluster running a set of Hyper-V VMs and the HDDs in the pool are running on 5-6 years old. I have a new batch of drives installed, and mapped in the same NAS enclosure ready to go.
 I'm looking for advice on the best way to migrate all of the VMs to their new home in a way that doesn't involve me manually rebuilding every VM configuration. If it was just 1-2 VMs I'd just copy the VHD over to the new drives and use the VHD as the storage for a new VM but I've got quite a few of these to move and I'd like to know for the future as well.
 Downtime is expected and perfectly fine, I've just never done this kind of migration before and want to make sure I don't do anything unnecessary or leave myself open to forgetting a config (My predecessor did this forgot to assign more than 1 core to more than a dozen VMs and no one noticed for months lol)
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am thinking of migrating a company from ADFS to use Azure AD as the primary IdP. What are like the cons of this because everywhere I've read, using Azure AD Connect is basically the new way to seamless SSO and auth and ADFS is outdated. Users already have E3 licenses and I feel like syncing between On-Prem and Azure is way better with AAD than ADFS. I'd love to get some input before I proceed. Perhaps there is compliance reasons or migration issues or something, but I feel like from my research AAD Connect is the way to go.

That only means that there are no more free IPv4 addresses that can be assigned to an organization. But not every IP address is in use. ISPs, hosting providers and other organizations have IPv4 reserves that are not actively in use. 
 Is there an estimate on how many IPv4 addresses are actually in use / are free?

 But when not at work the work PC must be turned off(we turn down the electricity at the evening in the biz ,for safety). So the key issue is syncing. so remote desktop won't work.
 Would using Google drive for all the data(including desktop and download folders ) and chrome sync, and local versions of office(not possible to use office 365) would work well ?

 Network Engineer for a Municipal ISP. I was doing some research on replacing our DHCP servers running on Windows Server with ISC Kea servers.
 How are you securing the access layer and authenticating CPE DHCP request?
 We are using XGS-PON. Currently, when a CPE sends a DHCP request, it just hits the DHCP relay agent and gets assigned an IP from the DHCP server. I'd like to implement some type of DHCP authentication, perhaps using RADIUS.
 What are your thoughts?

The plan was to transition the IT infrastructure support including compute, virtualization, storage, backup, all operating system support and network to Infosys. They figured they could complete the transition in less than 6 weeks. It's been almost 12 weeks and it's a disaster with just a few days left before most of the employees are let go. Most of the new contractors lack basic IT skills and any real fundamental understanding of how to manage the various platforms that power a $5+ Billion company. Some people have been retained(after applying for new positions) to preform the work of forklifting our 7K+ servers and applications to the public cloud. They are Fing around at level 10 right now and are fixin to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm volunteering with a smallish local preschool/elementary school with their internet services. They currently have an expensive Meraki firewall, Meraki switches, and 12 wireless access points. They also use VOIP for their main phones. Overall, it's a fairly simple system, just designed for teachers and administrators to use (not students), and for their phone service, which needs to be able to prioritized. There's no internal website, no guest access, no cellular backup, no real filtering needing, etc.
 They are being asked to pay over $5,000 to renew their Meraki license and in the short term, this is a tough request for them, especially as the Meraki hardware is over 6 years old, if not older (the switches are nearing end of support dates), so it may need to be replaced soon anyways.
 It seems that they could get by with Ubiquiti or Aruba Instant On hardware for much less, and work with a local IT company for support on a much cheaper level if they need it and I'm no longer able to help.
 Am I looking at this wrong?

 Regularly, when colleagues call with a problem and I pick up the phone or go to the employee's desk, a mysterious IT miracle happens. 
 The problems are gone, everything works and the employee is stunned.
 Most of the time they say things like, "That's not possible, I've tried it dozens of times and it didn't work. Now you're here and it works!" "It didn't work a moment ago!" "What did you do?"
 This "phenomenon" (for which I unfortunately don't have a name. I am open to suggestions here.) really fascinates me.
 Of course, it could simply be that my colleagues just want to annoy me.
 I will probably never know, but I wanted to find out if it happens to you too.

 Here is a link to the certificate's general tab: https://i.imgur.com/eMQF8xo.png
 Is this an indicator that my server has been compromised? Before the holidays, on December 14th, I fully patched our server and ran multiple vulnerability scanners including the Exchange HealthChecker script and no vulnerabilities were found. This certificate or any other indicators were not present.
 Here are some steps I've already taken to check for IoCs:
  
Checked AD and no administrator accounts or groups were created
 Checked SonicWALL logs and although I'm not the best at reading them, nothing stands out
 Ran full malware scans using BitDefender GravityZone, KVRT, and Hitman Pro with no hits on any of them
 Checked for new GPO settings
  
​
 EDIT: Thanks to u/axweld. The cert looks to be associated with the Dell ISM. I'm still looking to see if there is a way to prevent the cert from being seen as invalid, but my question above was answered.

 I’ve now been told by our MD that he wants to get rid of all security groups and add every user individually to files and folders, he also wants it go as far down as file access and not folder. So you can access a folder but not all documents in it.
 They have no understanding of what I do at all, this is something that I fundamentally disagree with but am fighting a lost cause.
 It seems he worked for a company before that was like this , where all Users had visibility of properties.
 What’s everyone’s thoughts on permissions? Am I the one in the wrong state of mind?

 I’d also been exposed to CI/CD processes and automation. I’ve done shell scripting for many many years in order to keep an eye on the environment and we were looking into tools.

 im learing about ssl/tls certs at the moment. I read a few articles, but they state very different things in every article.
 One article says there will be a warning in your browser if certicate expires, that the connection is not secure anymore. I know this error, if a website forgets it there is this typical browser warning that my traffic is not encrypted. But if i accept the risk i can still visit the website. Yes still bad, but not a 100% outage as i understand-
 Another article says there can be outages, but didnt go into detail more for some reason. What is meant with outage in this context technically? When i can still visit a site with accepting the risk its not a 100% outage right? 
 Maybe this is refered to some backend service when there is a expired ssl certificate? I read a story where Epic Games had a real outage of services because of exp ssl cert. Is something like this meant when talked about outtage?
 What is technically happening when there a outtage cause of ssl exp? Maybe a dumb question but im still learing :)

In this way I can just have my team members dealing with stuff that actually requires privileged access. I’d look to bump my l1 guys up to l2/l3 in terms of access/skills and look at using an agile self management approach for all operational techs where they all have the same knowledge and can do the same jobs creating a bit more speed of delivery, greater ownership and a better end user experience as a result. I’ve read a bit about this approach and think it could really work well in my own org but interested to discover how it works in practise from folk working in teams that work this way and from senior it execs who have put in place a similar methodology.

 Scenario being:
 ​
  
host connect directly to ISP router and get's DHCP from there.
 host can ping the 2 routers and the virtual IP as well, and vice versa.
 Tried with different hosts and various interface configs.
 ISP is using two routers for redundancy, one being Fiber and the other being LTE.
 When Fiber is up, the host can ping the internet.
 When Fiber is down and LTE is up it cannot ping the internet, the router is a cisco C881.
 The LTE has a default route created to direct all the traffic to the LTE interface
  
​
 After the troubleshoot we identified that the culprit was the command "ip route-cache cef" on the vlan that for some reason was not letting the host get to the internet.
 ​
 Mind you, i don't have much knowledge on networking, right now i am studying for CCNA.
 So if someone could explain what can cause this and why i would gladly appreciate.

They're pretty technically competent and have set up most of this themselves. But for the Mac user auth stuff, I'm not sure where to go. The environment is pretty simple, I think. It's certainly simpler than my home environment anyway.
 ​
  
Proliant ML30 G9 running TrueNAS Scale
 NUC7 i3 running Server 2016 (domain controller / AzureAD sync)
 UniFi AP's and switches, running RADIUS auth against AD for wireless
 7 users
 5 Mac Studio's
 2 iMac's
 iPhones and iPad's.
  
They also have 8 licenses for M365 Business Premium.
 In a perfect world, they want to sign into the Mac's via the M365 email "like you would in Windows". The Proliant is getting replaced, likely by something that will hold 8 drives, either QNAP or TrueNAS. The domain controller also has to go. RADIUS auth is meh, they could take it or leave it.
 They did look at Apple Business Essentials, but a D&B number is needed, and for whatever reason, they are refusing to give theirs to Apple. I know them well enough to know that they will burn down the building before they will budge on that. Which is a shame because Azure AD federation.
 They also don't want to mess with an MDM like Intune. Simple central user auth for both the clients and the file server. That's it. Except Mac.
 I looked at Jump Cloud and it seems like it might work, but I've always just bound Mac's to AD and moved on with my life.
 Does Jump Cloud seem reasonable or are there better options for what seems simple enough?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in a little business company as sysadmin. The total amount of data to backup would be... about 2-5TB. I'd like to ask you suggestions on how should I setup backups, considering we currently don't have a cloud environment.
  
Are tape-based hardware backups still recommended today?
 Do you need an active license with the provider to be able to recover from tape backups? I'm totally new to this, I wonder if I read some nonsense around the net.
 Do tape-based backups need to be brand specific? Eg. Dell servers with Dell backup, IBM with IBM...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I'm wondering how my fellow sysadmins manage / store / use passwords and what are your practices. 
 Do you use just one password everywhere? Do you use a password per site? Random? Or derived from something you can remember? 
 And where, if anywhere, do you store those passes? Do you write them down on sticky notes then stick them on your monitor? Into a text file? Or do you use one of the plethora of password managers out there, and if so, which one and why? 
 Myself: Used to use LastPass until a couple years ago when I exported everything, wiped everything I had there... And moved to a self-hosted Vaultwarden server + Bitwarden clients on my devices. 
 It's completely free (discounting the RPi at home I use for other stuff as well), I get to keep all my passwords somewhere I know of, and as I only access the Vaultwarden server over a Wireguars tunnel (without exposing anything else to the public internet), I daresay it's also decently secure. And completely free! With all the good jazz like "Military grade encryption" (lol), multi-platform, 24/7 access.

 I could go into advanced permissions and try and mirror the permissions that show on a new volume though I also think I should be able to do this using ICACLS but I can't find a definitive syntax on how to do it.
 Problem as I think I see it is ICACLS can reset down a folder tree from a parent but there is no parent for the root of the volume to inherit from.
 Does anyone know please?

 So this picture is of the app backups, they were restored from a shadow copy as per the title. But when I went to restore the apps, I entered the correct encrypted password using adb and it didn't restore? I think it's corrupted.
 I entered ./adb restore app.backup
 Any ideas on what I can do? Has the encrypted password changed or is the whole file corrupted?

I have 4 high risk apps that i believe could have been flagged even as suspicious but nope the AV says all is good 
 i have done indepth scans of my phone and SD card and yep no issues 
 the only use that im having for this app is the time based call filter which i haven't found anywhere on the playstore in any app 
 google play protect is buit in and already scans apps and on top of that Samsung's device protection(powered by macfee) which is also built in scans for malware also so do i really need another AV app 
 lastly do these mobile apps scan for android malware only or they can also detect windows malware

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there
 Wondering is anyone familiar if this Active-Passive template from Fortigate (below link), updates UDR's in Azure on failover ? .. Or do the firewalls themselves choose an active cluster member , therefore at any point in time there would be only one firewall responding to load balancer health checks . 
 I'm not a fan of updating UDR's on failover which is another Active-Passive option that Fortigate provides, should Azure be in some weird brown out state and UDR's / Public IP's fail to move - and have noted the requirement to use SNAT'ing on the Active-Active Fortigate template when using Expressroute etc.
 Hoping that the below template is reasonably simple in terms of failover, whereby the moving pieces are just the firewalls themselves electing a primary cluster member to respond to the Load balancers pointing at it - but not sure.
 ​
 Wondering if anyone has experience with it?
 ​

 I originally posted this to the wrong community here: https://www.reddit.com/r/lossprevention/comments/10c4cye/dlp_with_jupyter_notebookdatalore/ Re-posting here as it seems a bit more appropriate.
 I am looking for some advice on possible solutions to allow ML developers to access either Jupyter Notebook or Datalore in a secure environment while enforcing DLP to prevent sensitive data from leaving the environment. We access the environment via AWS user VPN which then traverses a site-to-site VPN to the environment. We considered using AWS Workspaces for this, however it does not play well with our external IDP. This has us back to the drawing board on solutions.
 First, I'm curious if anyone has personal experience with this using AWS AppStream and what up/down sides came with that. What I am unclear about is if I can use AppStream to connect to a Jupyter or Datalore instance running on-prem across the S2S tunnel or will it only work with SageMaker in the AWS VPC?
 Second, I'm open to any other solutions. What was attractive about VDI and AppStream is that we can control copy/paste and file transfer. But, with workspaces and our current IDP we can't get MFA enforcement working.
 Thanks in advance for any help. Happy to answer questions if my goals or explanation are not clear.

 Yesterday i just found myself in a position (due to an emergency) where i've become full time paid sysadmin for a small company, and i need to basically redo everything in the network and have a properly secure environment. 
 The setup is relatively simple, 5 workstations connected to an Avid Nexis storage server, 2 NAS units, one from synology ( and one i forgot the brand), and old Macintosh used for archival to LTO tapes and everything is connected trough a switch. 
 I kindly request some advice on where to start to properly fix up the network ( everything currently is on default passwords) and how can i identify all possible network connections such as FTP servers, network shares, so on and so forth, is there any kind of software than can find these sort of things? 
 Also i was requested to make all the workstations non admins ( windows 10) and to create a separate admin account, how could i make it in such a way that i can provision settings to all machines from a "central" machine, so i don't have to go to each machine and do changes in case i want for example change all their desktop wallpapers to a blank gray, so on and so forth. 
 Sorry if this is long winded and seems like something simple, but i've never done anything like this and i would love to get some feedback and help from people that actually know what they are doing!

My Signature ([jblow@contoso.com](mailto:joe@blow.com)).htm
  
The email address is case sensitive.
 For whatever reason, a lot of our org's email addresses (accounts) are capitalized on first and last initials, so [JBlow@contoso.com](mailto:JBlow@contoso.com).
 So you can copy the files to %appdata%\Microsoft\Signatures all you want, but unless the email in the file name matches exactly the case shown in the email account, Outlook won't find them locally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently took over IT for an architecture firm with a very simple AD environment. Their domain and file server are 5+ years old and are due to be replaced. Instead of spending a few thousand dollars on upgrading the aging hardware I'm considering migrating them to Azure AD / Intune as they have mentioned moving to the cloud. This could be beneficial from a management perspective as well as no hardware costs and potential hardware failures.
 Their current setup:
  
Domain Controller - Windows Server 2016 
 Used for very basic AD functions and DNS (DNS would be migrated to the Fortigate). Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.
 
 File Server - Windows 10 machine
 Microsoft 365 Business Standard licenses - Outlook & Office apps
  
I am unsure of the best practices when it comes to migrating everything over smoothly. The client heavily uses AutoCAD & Revvit and stores all of their files on the file server, so its unlikely file storage would be moving to the cloud but I would likely upgrade the file server or replace it with a NAS. They use Fortigate VPN to occasionally reach the file server from home to access these files. Will I run into any issues if we keep the local file server and move them to the cloud?
 Would you recommend migrating this client to the cloud and if so what would be my best course of action? From what I've gathered it sounds like a fairly simple process, upgrading the Microsoft 365 licenses to Business Premium, setting up AAD, Intune and Autopilot, either saving their profiles with Profwiz or wiping their devices, joining to AAD and letting autopilot do the work. Am I missing anything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have the following scenario:
 I have 2 servers without an extra storage appliance. One server should be productive and the second one should be a backup node with asynchronous replication. The hypervisor will be MS Hyper-V on Windows Server 2022.
 I plan to connect both servers (they will not be in the same room) with a Broadcom 10/25GbE over glass and two 48G port switches with 4 x SFP+ 10G uplink connected via glass to each other. The exact switch model has not yet been determined. 
 The HBAs in the servers have two ports, both of them will be used. 
 The clients will be connected via the 1G ports on the switches.
 ​
 On the hyper-v will run services like fileserver, dcs etc on vms.
 ​
 Will this work and did i forgot anything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title: IT Manager - however, I feel like it's more accurate and honest to call myself a systems administrator because I don't currently manage any humans. This is a solo IT gig.
 Current salary: $81k (yes, I know it's low by most people's standards in HCOL areas)
 Experience: 21 years, 13 at current job
 Location: US Midwest (city of ~100,000)
 Job situation: 130 staff, soon to be 140. 5 locations with most of the staff at the primary location. Very little remote staff, mostly onsite. This is technically a 24-7 operation (overnight is minimal) and I'm expected to be generally available to answer calls, but nights & weekends happens rarely...like maybe once or twice a month I'll get a call (very chill place). We are a Microsoft / O365 business with an on-prem 2-node Hyper-V cluster that runs 9 VMs. Pretty standard SCCM, WSUS, DCs, fileserver, certificate services, SQL, Sage, UniFi networking gear, and I manage the PBX. We outsource printers and AV systems. Otherwise, everything gets squished into my job, which I honestly like (I know some of you are ready to pounce and tell me I'm nuts). Also, I don't want to leave this job & only plan on working a few more years. My gut says $90-100k
 Edit: should have included that I've researched salary ranges for my area. Sysadmin with 15+ yrs experience range in my industry is $84-126k.

 Nothing fancy and hopefully inexpensive. Does not have to be free. 
 In the past I have used:
 Microsoft CRM
 Salesforce - (Too expensive)
 ServiceNow - (too bulky) 
 It would be good if it had integration with Teams, so people can open tickets using Teams chat, or emailing in or using a website to fill out specific information.

 so: Managed Switch Port ==> Unmanaged Switch ==> Router ===> endpoints...
 I think the unmanaged switch will flatten the traffic between our managed switch and their new router. Are there any adverse effects on the managed network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 a months days ago, I read about rport in an administrative magazine.
 rport.io
 And yesterday, one of my coworks came to me, and told me about that thing again, and that some of his collages that are working for an MSP are using it, for customers that don't have Itune or anything like that, and don't want to pay for it.
 So I was wondering, Is anybody using it as an alternative to other RMM Tools?
 Are you using it on Servers or clients? And do you use it to access infrastructure on client side? 
 And what is your opinion?
 Thank you for your opinions :)

 We use a bunch of tools at work which have audit logs (office 365, nextcloud, whatever), and I've cobbled together some tooling to fetch all those audit logs and store them in a centralized DB for easy access and reporting.
 This works reasonably well, but requires a bunch of scripting on my end to integrate new tools, and I'm lazy.
 Are there any solutions which can tackle this problem for me? A bit of googling didn't turn up anything interesting, but maybe there's a specific term for this of which I'm unaware?
 Thanks!

 I have to create a domain account with higher privileges, and I'm not able to set up MFA for this account, but sometimes it will be needed to use the account for RPD sessions etc.
 However, my idea was to set up a script, that generates a new password on the DC for this user, every 10 min or so.
 The same script would run in my password manager to create the same password at the same time. So I'm trying to implement a TOTP like thing there.
 My problem is, that I have to set up some kind of shared secret, so the generated passwords will be the same on both sides.
 And that's the point, is there a way to do this, by storing the initial seed somewhere on the DC where nobody can access it? Since seed + script = access
 Is there maybe another solution for this kind of problem?
 ​
 Thank you all

 I am part of a small business that got our leader's laptops for work. We currently have them set up with Kaspersky Endpoint Security Cloud and using Scalefusion for MDM/remote access. The computers are all set up with an Administrator account and a user account. The leaders only have access to the user account and we used the administrator account for any installs that need an override.
 We have both Windows (dell) laptops and MacBook Airs.
 We use Google Workspace for our files/email.
 We are looking to leave Kaspersky and go with a different AV vendor but are not sure of a good option. We also went with Scalefusion because they had an option for remote access with being able to track the computers and make sure they are up to date etc.
 I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on anything we have missed currently and if there are any better options.
 I was looking into Eset Protect Advanced and Splashtop instead of our current setup, but I believe I would be losing tracking and the ability to lock computers down if lost.
 Please feel free to ask any questions or let me know if you have any thoughts or ideas.

 Yesterday, I did a firmware update using Dell tool downloaded from Dell directly, and also a Windows Update. I suspect one of these removed the Boot Record for Windows. It has already happened twice in the past like a year ago, and I don’t remember how I fixed it those times because the troubleshooting process was long, chaotic, and grueling—with multiple dead ends every time. None of the googled solutions were working.
 The drive itself is still getting identified just fine, but booting into it does nothing. Before this happened, boot selection (the one that you access by hitting F12 on startup) had two records for the drive: the drive itself and Windows Bootloader. Now it’s just the drive itself (“UEFI I: PC SN520 NVMe WDC 512GB, Partition 1”)
 How do I repair the Windows Bootmanager entry? I would appreciate any help.
 Thanks

 Fast forward a few weeks, I've got an offer in hand. It's 5k more than my current base salary. I am still reviewing the other benefits, but the allure of the institution is a big big draw. There is also the potential for significant career growth.
 On the other end, I feel personally indebted to my current boss for various personal reasons; he's the reason I have the job I do currently. We are already understaffed at my current job so leaving would put some people I care about in a pretty crappy situation.

I woke up this morning like any other morning and while scrolling through Reddit in bed, I saw the first few posts of the problem being reported. That sure was a wake up call. 
 Thanks to the OPs, commenters with solutions, and others chatting, I was able to "fix" and reduce the impact of the problem before everybody starting showing up. My org has tens of thousands of devices and employees. This problem would have been a nightmare to handle. Thankfully, because of those posts and comments, I was able to stay 2-3 hours head of Microsoft's response, which saved us. It's very rare, but we were able to set up full resolutions and responses before users started to call us with problems. Overall, we had a few thousand devices impacted, but it only ended up being around 35% or less of our total fleet. Still bad, but it could have been sooo much worse. I know I can't be the only one in this boat.
 Talking with multiple Microsoft employees (Support, fast-track, devs), they asked me to link to the Reddit posts that I quietly brought up when I said it was a global issue. Congrats to those OP's! Your posts have been seen by everyone! It looks like Microsoft is currently working on solutions to help with impacted shortcut files so only time will tell at this point.
 Again, big thank you to everybody, from the OP's to the people leaving comments. Even the lurkers up voting topics. Today is one of those days where I'm thankful that a community like this exists. If you had this problem at your organization, I wish you a speedy recovery. If you didn't, enjoy this time to relax before the next big problem comes through. Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company just got bought some software that requires 5 linux servers to be spun up. One for an NFS and then 4 nodes. I think the nodes will only be used to host runtime engines. We currently only use Windows for our servers and nobody on my team has any in-depth Linux experience. 
 My only experience with Linux has been Kali, Ubuntu, Tails, and Parrot. Do any of y'all have a favorite Linux distro to use as a server? Anything that would be useful to a Linux novice such as myself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a HA pair of fortigates in a load balancer sandwich design (A/P) in Azure, after trying to understand the methods used to perform a 1:1 NAT, there does not seem to be a dedicated guide that goes through each specific step to set this up. 
 First question is regarding HA and the use of the SDN failover. Is this really needed or can the Azure Load Balancer on the external side perform this?
 Next question is when I have attempted to configure this on the External load balancer to NAT to the Gate's secondary private IP addressing to a new address, this does not seem to work properly.
 Would love to try and understand how this works exactly and how to properly configure this.
 Thanks!

 However, I was attempting to trunk the two switches to allow devices on Juniper A to talk to devices on Fortinet B all on the same .10 network (not jumping to vlans yet). when I configure the trunk interfaces and connect the ports, networking starts failing. Juniper A devices cannot seem to talk to Fortinet B devices at all, and Fortinet B devices start dropping packets among themselves. The trunk ports are configured in the same was as those going to the firewall which seem to work. 
 Juniper Trunk Configuration:
 [edit interfaces ge-0/0/0] native-vlan-id 1; unit 0 { family ethernet-switching { interface-mode trunk; vlan { members [ 1 20 ]; } storm-control default; } } 
 Fortiswitch configuration has port 1 configured as a trunk with native vlan as 1 and allowed as 20.
 I'm also not sure if this is a loop issue but the STP setting is enabled on the fortiswtich, and RSTP on the Juniper
 Juniper:
 # show protocols rstp interface all; 
 Any ideas how I can get this working so devices on each switch can communicate with each other?

 -----------------------------------------------------
 Having an issue with 2 servers that have external disk shelves connected to them. Each server has close to 60TB of data stored on these external shelves. They're in production, and actively serving customers. The two servers and all 6 shelves are covered under a support contract with HP.
 On December 14th I opened a ticket with HPE Support using the serial # of one of our servers which is under support contract. After a month of back and forth regarding firmware / BIOS updates required on the servers, and sending numerous AHS logs, and doing a bunch of un-related troubleshooting, the support engineer tells me that they can't do any more and I have to open a case up using the disk shelf's serial number.
 Why couldn't you fucking tell me that at the beginning!! Instead HP support wasted a month of our time. Days between responses on a ticket that is marked as "Critical Degraded". Stressed us out over the holiday's causing several of us to have to work over the holiday's to run CHKDSK on the volumes, and worrying that our data might get lost. All so they could turn around and tell us to open a ticket with the storage team instead.
 God damn HP, you fucking suck. Never EVER will I buy HP hardware or products again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, 
 I work in a cloud environnement and a client of ours has a backup server where he paid for 5Mbps only. So for the WAN interface of the client toward the server in output i applied some shaping. But we have a monitoring console sending ping and those ping started to get insane latency (3000+ms) and 60 packet loss as a result. So i wanted to exclude ICMP packets from that shaping policy. 
 ​
 Now, this is on a Cisco Nexus 3048 and the config might be a little bit different than some of you are used to. At least that was the case for me. 
 ​
 Anyway, onto the configuration : 
 ip access-list ipExclude 
 permit icmp any any
 ​
 class-map type qos match-all ipExclude
 match access-group name ipExclude
 ​
 ​
 policy-map type qos ipExclude
 class type qos ipExclude
 set qos-group 2
 class type qos class-default
 set qos-group 0
 ​
 system qos
 service-policy type qos input ipExclude
 ​
 class-map type queuing DILITRUST-OUTPUT
 match qos-group 2
 ​
 ​
 policy-map type queuing DILISTRUST-COS
 class type queuing DILITRUST-OUTPUT
 bandwidth percent 50
 class type queuing class-default
 bandwidth percent 50
 shape kbps 5000
 ​
 Interface Ethernet1/12
 service-policy type queuing output DILISTRUST-COS
 ​
 Of course, this doesn't work and i tried multiples things but i just don't get how it doesn't work. ICMP packets should normally be tagged with the qos-group 2 and all the rest of the traffic with the default qos-group 0 and therefore, not be shaped as per the first class DILITRUST-OUTPUT once it matches on it. 
 ​
 But no, it doesn't work. Any network engineer here might have an idea?
 Thanks!

 I would like your opinion about two design that me and a colleague made for a customer. I did design 1 and he did design 2.
 Proposed design-1
 Proposed design 2: https://imgur.com/Eu1tsbn
 The customer have: two fortigate firewalls, two switches and three physical servers for their new network setup.
 Basically, the only difference is the internet connection between my design and my colleague design. He preferred that the internet terminated on the switches instead of the firewall compared to my design (internet terminated directly on the firewall). Unfortunately, he could not explain why (yeah I know.. he said that he have seen lot of customer going for design 2) and I've been trying to research about this but no luck.
 I would like if someone here know why the design 2 is preferred more than design 1. I know that it all depends on the requirements etc.. but just in general, if you would look at both designs, which one would you go for and why? I'm curious and would like to know both the pros and the cons for both design.
 ​
 Appreciate all your answers.
 ​
 EDIT: For whatever reason, I have issues naming the links from imgur so I will just post the URL for design 2. Apologize for that
 EDIT 2: there is only one ISP link and will just be a default route to the ISP (no BGP). The firewall are in HA mode, active/passive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a fairly unique and complex question, to me anyway.
 Essentially Site A (main site) has a decent number of workstations on the company domain. The interesting thing is that the networking (and firewall) is provided by a different company with the core being in an entirely different locale. The good news is that in our building, we have a switch in the basement with a few ports that assign WAN IPs. 
 Using this, I set up a pfSense firewall and hooked up to WAN and LAN. At Site B we have a UniFi USG4. I set up an IPSec tunnel between the two, and got as far as being able to resolve the Windows domain from Site B, and ping the (real) LAN gateway but not any further. NO domain controller traffic was able to pass. 
 Basically my thoughts were that since I have access to both a WAN IP, and the local subnet that 99% of our Windows machines are on, I had everything I needed to create a tunnel from inside of the other company's network and get our Site B network connected to resources that Site A uses WITHOUT asking the other company to make any changes. (No I'm not doing anything illegal, nor will this cause issues)
 Am I missing something? Or is it just simply not possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not good at Cisco switches, but I need to configure somewhat redundant configuration on two C1000 switches connected to a Comware distribution switch. The idea is: Cisco switches are connected to the rest of the network by Port-channel1 which carries only one tagged uplink VLAN, and connected to each other by Port-channel2 with 2 VLANs: uplink and "user" VLAN. I put the user VLAN in MSTP instance 1, the upstream is in default instance 0. For now spanning tree is blocking uplink port in instance 0 and I can't figure out why. It should be blocking Po2 according to plan. 
 SW2#show spanning-tree blockedports Name Blocked Interfaces List -------------------- ------------------------------------ MST0 Po1 
 Could you please give me some advice?
 The network diagram is here
 Important config parts:
 SW1#show running-config
 ! spanning-tree mode mst ! spanning-tree mst configuration name axia revision 1 instance 1 vlan 192 ! spanning-tree vlan 1,816 priority 12288 ! interface Port-channel1 switchport trunk allowed vlan 816 switchport mode trunk spanning-tree mst 0 port-priority 192 spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 64 ! interface Port-channel2 switchport trunk allowed vlan 192,816 switchport mode trunk spanning-tree mst 0 port-priority 64 spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 192 !

 I just by coincidence read about it. Microsoft is changing from using the Windows root store, to a build in trust list, starting with version 110, and the GPO will be removed in 111. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnote-stable-channel#version-1090151849-january-12-2023
 We have a lot of internal tools we use, all validated by our Windows CA root cert. 
 Am I misreading this, or what are you guys doing about it? 
 We of course use public CAs for our DMZ/public stuff, but internal websites, it's so nice to create a certificate for 10 years. 
 Have have been lazy so far and Just need to get with the page and start using "real certs" or ?

 We have one of our stakeholders that is fixated on this one solution for her team, which will connect and integrate to one of our business critical systems. This system is one that me and my team are responsible and own. She doesn't really come from a technical background, but my former boss (left the org) told her 3-4 years ago that this solution isn't going to meet our needs or work well. We're being forced to integrate it and have serious concerns about performance/stability impacts. The vendor's implementation team doesn't seem all too concerned and during one call the consultant started whining like a child that we were delaying the roll out. She seems to be siding with the vendor and pushing aside any of our concerns. It's just a frustrating and stressful situation overall and one of the many drivers that's causing me to consider new roles.

Am i using the right cable? I have a USB-RJ45(?) and a Serial-RJ45(?) cable. I guess it's not really RJ45, as it doesn't fit. Or can i use a normal network cable?
 
I have the MAC of the device (printed on the back) but not the IP to connect to. Can i scan for the correct IP or is there some kind of default?
 
Anything else i should know, handling switches?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, our small computing cluster has 3 computing nodes and 1 file server. The file server has around 70TB data to be accessed by the 3 computing nodes. All of the 3 computing nodes have 3 4TB SSDs which are now idling.
 Currently the computing nodes use NFS to access files on the file server, and all the servers are connected to a 1 Gbps network. Is there a proper way to create a "pool of cache" from those SSDs so that there is no need to always access files from the file server? Or is it even a correct solution, or should I just stay with local SSD cache?
 I have tried to set up GlusterFS with those SSDs and FS-Cache on top of GlusterFS but it caches nothing.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a vaguely technical project manager (so apologies if some of the terminology is wrong) and I’m curious about what a future enterprise network might look like. Today we have a fairly traditional on-prem design. 2 data centres, some public facing services, VMware, F5 load balancers, mostly Cisco everything else including core switches.
 At each site we have MPLS, and local internet breakout from the same provider as the MPLS. We have Cisco L3 edge switches, and Cisco wireless access points managed via controllers at the DCs. All internet traffic goes out via the local break out, not over the MPLS.
 Most of our end user and public facing services are already in the cloud, with the rest moving over the next 3 years. And the data centres will reduce to a couple of racks of legacy internal and public facing systems.
 Endpoint security will be on the devices (zScaler), and the view is that the office network will end up no more trusted than any other network.
 At that point in 3 years time, my questions are why do we need a WAN, why do we need core switches and routing or expensive MPLS circuits? Then why do we need L3 edge switches?
 In my simple mind we would need reliable managed internet access and WiFi with a management platform. Not even sure if we need much wired Ethernet except for printers and a few other appliances. Everyone has laptops and we don’t have desk phones. Mostly normal Microsoft Office based workloads.
 So would we effectively be no different to a rent-an-office location? What equipment and management tooling do they use? Still Cisco?
 Thanks for indulging me!

 I was doing some troubleshooting the other day and noticed something very strange. One of my ping replied reported a "time" value exceeding the TTL value. It's my understanding this should only ever result in a timeout error rather than a reply, correct?
 It only happened on one of the pings, so maybe this was some weird one-off bug, but I figured I'd ask in-case I am misunderstanding the ping reply information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm in a hard spot likely due to a lack of fundamental knowledge in a particular area so I'm hopeful one of you can explain the issue I'm having enough that I can find the right language for seeking help.
 The scenario is pretty simple. I am using Python to automate configuration commands to Adtran OLT network devices. Currently, the app mostly works in the sense of being able to issue commands to retrieve information tables for parsing.
 The problem I'm up against is when I start sending commands back to apply configuration changes, something very weird happens with the CLI which I can replicate exactly through my Gnome Terminal by pasting the same commands that break in the automated interactive shell.
 Here is an example of the command set where the problem starts:
 enable config t shaper “interface gpon 1/0/1@1/4/1.gpon channel 1” 1@1/4/1.gpon rate 500000 exit shaper “remote-device 1@1/4/1.gpon_0” 1/4 rate 500000 exit exit 
 For reasons unknown to me, once the space after the second double quote is sent, the shell does something weird and the command breaks as invalid.
 Here is a visual example of what happens to the CLI in Gnome Terminal which is essentially the same result I see with the automated shell as well: https://imgur.com/a/Id8snAA
 The automated shell is currently using a vt100 terminal type if that helps any. For the record, the command examples provide have been tested directly through a shell on a macOS computer and they work as intended there so the command format is where it should be.
 Any takers on what I'm missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So.. this isn't a gotchya question. It's legit.
 On current revisions of Windows, 10 and 11:
 January 10, 2023—KB5022282 (OS Builds 19042.2486, 19044.2486, and 19045.2486) - Microsoft Support 
 There is a vulnerability in WinRE, that if unpatched...
 🔃 Security Update Guide - Loading - Microsoft 
 What kind of security feature could be bypassed by successfully exploiting this vulnerability?
 A successful attacker could bypass the BitLocker Device Encryption feature on the system storage device. An attacker with physical access to the target could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to encrypted data.
 Are there additional steps that I need to take to be protected from this vulnerability?
 Yes. You must apply the applicable Windows security update to your Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). For more information about how to apply the update, see Add an update package to Windows RE.
 Are both offline images and WinRE in a running environment affected by this vulnerability?
 No. Only a WinRE image on a running PC is vulnerable. This can be any time a recovery or reset operation is invoked from the main OS.
 ​
 So:
 1) JUST the CU doesn't fix it. You have to patch WinRE. Most people won't do this.
 2) Since the Windows Recovery environment is not encrypted/protected, someone could just 'replace' the WinRE.wim file with an 'old, bad one', and exploit this vulnerability, even if you patched 'your' device.
 Have any organizations/anyone else spoken about this? It seems to have effectively slipped under the radar, and while it would be 'hard' to exploit, maybe, and 'hard' to replace a WinRE environment... it's not THAT hard.
 I'm not saying "go 3rd party", by any means, but this seems... bad? Maybe I'm mis-understanding/reading it, but this seems like, for the current Windows revisions, a 'permanent' issue.

 ​
 I have a server with exim on it, it works fine most of the time but it sometimes (once a week or two) it just stops functioning. Now I've found the the issue and the fix, but I can't find the cause...
 The issue is the /etc/virtual/pophosts file just dissapears, it gets removed for some reason, and the fix is to just create it once again, simple as that. 
 Problem is even though exim has ~550 pages in it's documentation there's not a single mention about the pophosts file. After some digging I found that this file contains the IP's of user's that already authenticated, but nothing about the file deleting itself. Has any of you ever encountered that issue before? How do I even troubleshoot an issue like that?

maintaining, upgrading and deployment of 20 desktop applications through AWS Appstream once a week
 SME for those applications, contacting escalated customers (tier 3..I'm the last resort), figuring out root cause and fixing them
 use data analytics to discover and solve widespread issues, for example, getting a splunk report showing how many customers have resource issues that cause performance problems for desktop customers.
 discovering and reporting defects, ensuring that we can reproduce them before sending to development.
  
There are many more things we do, as our team has become a kind of dumping ground for things no one else wants to do or can't figure out.
 What job out there can I equate to what we do? I'd like to start looking for positions elsewhere that pay way more for the stuff we currently do and or go to my HR with information showing that the jobs that we do should be siloed under a different name that pays more.
 Like right off the bat the app stream stuff, I looked up and there's something called an appstream desktop virtual engineer and they make 100k!! 
 And that's just one of my responsibilities. So I definitely feel like I'm getting shafted here.

 Also that it can make an IPsec tunnel would be nice.

 It is going to be used in Denmark where 5G data is really cheap :)

 Also can I license Windows Server 2019 with 2022 license?
 And can somebody tell me a real price of Windows Server Datacenter 2022?
 On official Microsoft page it says 6,155$, but I'm finding prices as low as 30$. Is this real? It's all kind of confusing. 🤯

 Whilst not logged in Windows Defender->Operational, if we try to do a quick repair of Office we see that Windows Defender Exploit Guard has blocked the creation of .lnk files
 From what I can see, this appears to be the "Block Win32 API calls from Office Macro" ASR rule malfunctioning, potentially after the installation of AntivirusSignatureVersion 1.381.2140.0
 Is anyone else seeing similarly? 
 One one machine I've changed that rule to audit rather than block and Office repair has since been successful and the creation of .lnk files via our powershell scripts is functioning again..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am wondering about the best practice for a scenario that has been causing problems. 
 I am working in an IT department of a university and in each classroom is a desktop computer for the teacher and it has all kinds of physical equipment for distance learning.
 The computers are domain joined of course but the problem is that the sample rate on the soundcard needs to be at 48khz for all the software and equipment to work correctly.
 When teacher (domain user) logs in to the computer the first time the sample rate is always at 44.100 so it needs to be set manually to 48khz in the soundcard settings. But once it is set it will be correct next time this user logs in.
 So this only happens the first time each user logs in. 
 The soundcards are not the same in each classroom so we are not going to take care of this by some group policy.
 I know about the default user profile settings, but the computers are all on domain but with different soundcards between classrooms. So what I am trying to figure out is the best practice if I can log me in on the computer for the first time locally, set the sample rate to correct settings and then every other domain user that logs in after that will get the same settings. 
 Thanks

 We have already thought about different variants, how we could proceed. Important requirement: For validation reasons, the shares must be accessible under the old DNS name.
 ​
 Variant 1: Inplace Upgrade to 2012
 We do an inplace upgrade to 2012R2 and all shares etc. should still work. The inplace upgrade worked fine on our test server. 
 But our two file servers have a problem with it and run into a never ending bootloop after the upgrade. 
 ​
 Variant 2: New server
 We set up 2x new servers, change the hostnames on the old server. Mount the partitions of the old file servers, import the shares from the registry of the old servers and in the best case everything works fine.
 ​
 Variant 3: DFS
 We replicate the shares with our DFS server. As soon as we are 100% sure that everything has been replicated correctly, we shut down the old file servers. However, I am not sure how we can make the shares accessible via the old hostnames.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I started working at my current employer there has been a lot of patching and fixing various security holes. Guy before me was tech savvy but not comfortable with server environments etc, the age old tale. Without going into too much detail, we have a department which does a lot of development. Until recently, all of these employees (approx 15 people) all had local admin rights (users added to AD group, GPO set said group as local admin on all workstations). Obviously we don't want that many admin accounts, even if they only have those privileges on workstations and not servers etc, let alone people who do not work in the IT department. 
 As you may have figured out, this caused some outrage among the developers. We are not big enough yet to have a "functional" helpdesk and utilize LAPS in an effective way so I'm still walking around approving installs. However, so far that has only happened once since this change was applied. This makes me believe 1. they vastly exaggerate the amount of times they do things that require admin privileges (no surprise) and 2. This is more of a "hurt ego" situation where they are more upset over being "downgraded" than it is an actual issue. 
 Do you think I made the right call or is it overkill? 
 TL;DR: Developers lost their admin rights and are upset. I think it is a major security hole to let an entire department have admin rights. I believe they are more upset of having been "downgraded" than it actually being a problem, but I'm doubting myself. 
 Thank you!
 P.S I am the only one doing IT and we are >100 people in three countries

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have an Azure AD Domain Services instance running which resides in its own vnet. This vnet is peered with our site-to-site VPN vnet. Traffic is allowed between the vnets and routing gateway is enabled.
 We are able to domain join VMs from the site-to-site vnet to the aadds vnet. However we are having difficulties domain joining an on-prem server over the site-to-site VPN. When trying to domain join we're getting a "DNS name does not exist." error. 
 The DNS servers x.x.x.5 and x.x.x.4 are set in the ethernet adapter options and we are able to ping these IPs. However, pinging the domain fails. We have flushed the DNS and restarted the server several times.
 Does anyone have a clue what might be the issue here? Thanks in advance.

It worked the same day as the change and half the next day. This is affecting only this user and I've tried everything that usually solves all the Outlook issues but no luck this time.
 ​
 What I tried:
 - New mail profile
 - Checked that "Offline mode" is off
 - Deleted .ost file
 - Repaired Office
 - Reinstalled Office
 - Cleared Credential Manager
 - Reset the users password
 - Ran Outlook in Safe mode
 - Ran SCANPST on the file
 - Ran the Support & Recovery Assistant
 - Logged in on OneDrive
 - Opened Word/Excel to verify that the correct user is logged in on other Office apps
 OWA works..
 I also checked the sign-in logs in Azure and no obvious errors in there, they are approved and succeeded during the time I tested. If I load the old mail profile Outlook opens but is disconnected, if I create a new profile it stops at the "Loading Profile" and after ~5 minutes I get:
 Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook Window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The attempt to log on to Microsoft Exchange has failed.
 Any tips from the Exchange gurus?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, it finally happened. We have a customer who is running two windows servers that have all of their roles bare metal. Remote server is Fileserver, domain controller, app server, FTP server, print server... you name it. Local is a DFS target and a "backup" DC. 
 We all know this is not ideal. I know. Well sometime in the last 30 days, my domain controllers stopped talking to each other. Remote is PDC, other is onsite. They are in separate sites in active directory. The onsite one is out of sync and now can't authenticate against the PDC. So all shared resources (printers, mostly) no longer work. Nor does DFS replication. 
 We got lucky on this one. After getting a manual printer mapping going, and trying to do it the 'right way' to repair the link I said screw it. I demoted the onsite DC, removed from domain and then re-added it to the domain. I learned a lesson there. Also the lesson to set a monitor for the log events for if this issue happens again. 
 I'm hoping that my RCA of this will finally convince my boss that they need to break out the roles to individual vms and (if I'm really lucky) get a 3rd DC vm spun up... or just move the app server to an Azure App, remove on prem domain and just do local printer mapping. (its like, 8 users.) 
 Anyway, happy Thursday!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our terminal server has Microsoft 365 apps for business installed and usually behaves well otherwise.
 A handful of users have secondary mailboxes in a separate 365 tenancy with Business Standard licensing rather than our Business Premium licensing which means they can't use that license in the terminal server (no shared computer activation).
 In the case of these users, they get prompted for modern auth each time they sign into the terminal server, but the session will then persist during that session between launches of Outlook. If the option is selected to sign into other apps, the other apps will keep that session in future Windows sessions while Outlook does not.
 It seems to be something related to the cross-tenancy situation, but finding information about this has been difficult.
 We've tried downgrading the modern auth for these users by setting DisableADALatopWAMOverride to 1, however the prompts continue regardless.
 Does anyone have any extra insight into this issue?

 I currently have a Windows Server instance with AD DC and DNS installed that I use for home configuration and testing. I would like to deploy my own Software Center or Company Portal for home use. It will be used by my family as a way to easily install their most commonly used applications. It will also work great as a way to learn how this software works.
 From what I understand, Intune will potentially be replacing SCCM so I believe that's the software I would like to use for this test setup with my home server.
 Is there a good guide on how to install and setup Intune so that I can get Company Portal working? That is, unless you guys think I should go with SCCM's Software Center instead.
 Thank you all for you insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started a help desk job with zero training and I’m the only person for 4 weeks. 
 They are asking me to issue replacement computers for the staff. The staff wants all their old files, web browser favorites and everything to be the same on the new computer. 
 I’ve been copying the user profile with /c$ and remote into the two computers for the transfer. 
 from one computer to the next. But it’s usually like 60 gigs and takes forever. 
 They have their own file share drive. Which i shouldn’t have to transfer/copy 
 Is there a faster way? I assume the only thing I should have to transfer is everything that’s not in their personal drive ?
 I’m lost here lol Definitely regret taking this job

 Not sure what the best approach is. As is users in our organization use over 4000 different pieces of software. No way I have time to review all of that.
