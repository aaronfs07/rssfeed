I have never really been happy with the Schitt, so I was curious if any one here had any reccomendations for a new DAC. I do not do anything too crazy, mainly just listening to music when I get woken up at 2 am and am in troubleshooting mode, or catching up on documentation at home. I thought I would ask here instead of one of the Audio sub-reddits, as I am looking for something sensible, not something insane

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is making me scratch my head. I've got a lovely IKEV2/IPSEC tunnel setup between an AWS environment, and onprem. Both sides using Strongswan as the endpoints. Routing rules are applied in the Strongswan instances via iptables.
 The onprem side is behind NAT, so the required ports are forwarded. Everything works great, but what I cannot understand is, how do my other network devices know how to find the tunnel? Presumably packets destined for AWS must be directed to the Strongswan VM which in turn knows the route, but by what mechanism are packets arriving at the Strongswan VM in the first place?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, they've got above-ground fiber between my building and main building at work where I started recently. 
 They said after a storm the fiber stopped working so they are using ubiquity wifi external antennas instead to connect the two buildings.
 After I replaced a couple of smaller unmanaged switch in my building with a new larger managed switch I poked around and found the fiber to copper converter wasn't getting any power. Found the plug the power brick for the converter was dead.. Plugged it into another plug and got power.. Yay
 So now I get the the copper cat 5 plugged into my laptop and get the hoped for activity lights blinking and the gigabit connection light as well.. But just get unidentified network on laptop
 I Plug it into the switch instead
 The switch shows the port change to UP state and I again have activity and Gb connection
 Port shows its up but no ip or any connection info/network.
 Still have to investigate the other side the fiber connects to the switch in other building But, it gets a connection and there is all lights blinking as if there is traffic flow 
 Not sure where to take this beyond checking other end connections. 
 Even if signal sucked due to messed up fiber, if it detects a gb connection and shows traffic, I should have at least spotty network connection no? 
 Any suggestions welcome! 
 Thank you!

 Debian 10
 Client:
 Windows 11
 I use my file server as a no-authentication access terminal in my computer room. I'm not worried about someone one coming in, joining the network, and downloading my stuff. If anything, being able to easily do that is great since the few times people do want to do it, those people have no idea what a hard disk is, more or less what Samba is.
 I've been using Samba for years now, but I heard that NFS has less overhead and wanted to try it out. It was easier to set up and get running. It took me longer to get Windows set up to read the share then to make the share.
 I did the anonyms registry for User and Group since I'm not overly concerned about security.
 Now the issue (in windows) is that if I leave a window (or a panel in Double Commander) pointing anywhere in the share and then come back after a minute or two, it hangs for about 8 seconds before resuming.
 Is this normal for NFS shares, or did I misconfigure something?
 The feedback from windows mount;

 Site goes down completely, so no visibility inside at all. Spent some time coaching the service desk to get some trace routes and pings from the users, photos of router status LEDs and checking with the ISP for known service outages in the area.
 Too much time goes on we decide to just get a contractor / tech hand out there to console me in to the router via a remote connection to their laptop.
 There are four built in switch ports on the router and two of these are configured, one for LAN and one for WAN. I'm consoled in now, router is not dead, good. But WAN interface is down. I can see LAN is up then I notice another port that is up and is not configured.
 Check logs, it came up about the same time the WAN went down.. I ask the tech to move what ever is in that port to the WAN and.. boom, sites back up.. someone had literally moved the WAN cable into another port!! WHY?
 I tell the tech to ask them who has been in here (comms room) today, who was in here at the time network went down, why are they moving cables.
 The site managers response was "well the wifi was running slow and that happens sometimes and what we do is we just move this cable from one port to another it comes good again".
 WHAT
 No, seriously, in a technical sense it is completely impossible. I even reviewed config backups for a sanity check. There has only ever been one WAN port. What the heck man. 
 ​
 TLDR site manager troubleshooting site wifi decided to move the WAN connection on their router to another port.

He's planning to spend a bit of dough getting our systems aligned with the systems they setup for other companies. They want to host our websites, software, and applications instead of using google and aws as we've been doing. I guess they want users to be logging into hosted computers as well. I'm not thrilled with the mgmt style and I think they're just trying to load their pockets but... I'm interested to see how they migrate and implement the different technology.

 I've been making notes of these Windows updates errors and they all have something in common, I can't seem to fix them and get the systems back into a state of functioning updates. No matter what I've tried they persist and prevent some or all of the updates from installing.
 there are the errors that change like 0x80070424, 0x800703ee etc...
 I have tried running all malware antivirus scans and there is no foul play to my knowledge.
 Here's what I've tried:
  
Running dism to repair it (even with a extracted new windows image file)
 Running sfc /scannow
 installing window from flash drive on another pc and hard reset and everything
 Cleaning the C: drive and temp folder
 Removing old updates and trying to re-run updates
 Manually downloading window
 3rd party programs like reset windows update tool and sfcfix
 Updating/uninstalling/reinstalling Microsoft's redistributables and runtimes
 i have reset pc for like 6 times
 Ive tried running the troubleshooter, and running a windows update repair
  
I'm fresh out of ideas and I've been researching these issues for 3 days
 I wish there was some way to fix and is there any fix to this problem and thank you in advance please

 One Windows 11 PC ("Win11") and one Windows 10 PC ("Win10") on a LAN. Accounts under the same (admin) name ("Userguy") on both devices. RDP is properly configured on both devices, and a login preset (Username: "Win10\Userguy", password: "3xample") has been set up on Win11 to login on Win10. These credentials work when entered manually.
 Issue:
 When trying to RDP from Win11 into Win10 from a shortcut or selecting Win10 from the dropdown in the RDP interface, the login always fails and a window opens to enter login details. In the window the default user name reads "Win11\Userguy" instead of "Win10\Userguy", which then has to be entered manually again, and the right password. Which work fine. But even when saving these credentials, the next time the issue happens again.
 Edit:
 After doing a manual save of the preset, it now seems to properly save the username ("Win10\Userguy") but the login still fails and I am dumped in the Windows Security dialogue ("Your credentials did not work") which asks me to enter the correct credentials. Now the default username reads "Win10\Userguy" but if I just enter the password I am returned to the Windows Security dialogue ("Your credentials did not work"), and only after using "More choices" and entering the credentials again (username and password) does the login succeed.

 The server feels really solid and quick when its running and setting it up we've had no issue. However at some unknown point it's started taking a crazy long time to boot, like 40 - 45 mins. It just sits on the spinning circles forever although you can access file shares on it during this time and some other functionality is working.
 I've checked the logs and a large number of the services seem to be timing out while starting. There doesn't seem to be a pattern though and they are all kinds of different services covering different things. When the server finally does boot, the following services are stopped:
 Distributed Transactions Coordinator
 Diagnostics Policy
 Network Access Policy 
 But if you click to start them, they seem to startup without issue and once it finally loads it all runs without issue and seems 100% fine.
 The server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, File/Print and NAPS roles.
 It's an absolute nightmare to debug because I make a change then have to spend 45 mins waiting to see if it works. There doesn't seem to be any errors other than the services are just timing out with the error "A timeout was reached while waiting for <service>.
 Anyone seen this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have suggestions for an outlook add-in that would help manage all the daily alerts that come in? I’m thinking something that could summarize alerts from a system, but if the number, or type of alert changes from the “normal” then we get a high importance email, otherwise something that would summarize the nightly alerts. I don’t want to set up rules necessarily, because I don’t want them all to go, I just want fewer I guess. Or a summary of the ones we do get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've been searching around this section for recommendations on storage switches to be used for iSCSI SAN traffic.
 My environment is fairly easy with gigabit ethernet HP 2530 switches for SAN to Hypervisor connectivity.
 Usually I have 3 VMware hosts connected to two HP 2530 switches and going to compellent or powervault SANs.
 Our environment is mostly HP/Aruba and it would be easier for me to work with.
 I'd like to have 1/10GbE capabilities and 24 ports per switch should suffice.
 I've inherited this network so how it currently is configured with the existing 2530s was not my design.
 I do recall when working with VMWare support, we realized that the buffer on the 2530 was too low and was potentially impacting some performance.
 I guess I'm am not entirely sure what I should be looking for. As I have the option to standardize our sites, I think using Aruba will still be a good option, but I'm all ears.
 Ethernet or SFP should be fine, I would be looking at deploying 1gb while we wait for hardware for 10gbe connectivity.
 Any suggestions on what I should look into? I believe that buffers are critical for SAN switches but aside from that, I'm not sure.
 Thank you

 I've used both shareX and greenshot- sharex felt way too clunky and I hate that the region selector for greenshot is a transparent green- completely unnecessary imo. 
 Is there a better alternative? I know I could use ctrl+win+s, but I hate that I don't have a way to auto redirect the output to my desktop as a png, instead it goes to some random-ass folder that I have to dig for.

Problem is the wireless and FortiAPs. Users randomly complaining about wireless drops, slow speed, poor handoff between APs. 
 Have worked with fortinet tac and have upgraded firmware, adjusted settings. Problem is each tech has different opinions on what settings to use. No combination of firmware/settings seems to be correct. A change may correct one issue but then either introduce a new issue or make a pre existing issue worse. 
 I am getting to the point where I want to throw in the towel on fortinet wireless and swap to another product line. 
 I know I am going to get lots of different answers. Which wireless vendor is best for simple Wi-Fi network deployments? Trying to get something where I can set it and forget it and stop getting complaints from users on a weekly basis.

 I hadn't touched gotomeeting since mid 2010's, and what it is now is too overwhelming for the guy I'm trying to help. Back in the day, it was just "Open thing, here's the meeting code, click ok till we're in a meeting, hit share screen, hit give control." Now it's prompting for accounts, has the whole zoom presenter-isms, attendee popups, and overall so much noise that I couldn't guide him into actually getting his screen successfully shared.
 So like, before I have to get in the car and drive 3 hours to go setup a RealVNC server on this guys box, do you have any better tools to recommend? I'm not on his network/not vpn, his machine is Win11 Home (no inbound RDP). Absolute minimum popups/clicks to get into the meeting is like my only concern, they panic whenever anything pops up, at all =p

 But before anyone stopped to consider asking for an API exception for bots and apps, were just protesting by having subreddits going dark temporarily/permanently on the basis that we wont have some third party app and accessibility features. which is not effective without negotiating for special app/bot exception for the API alongside the protests.
 Unless all these protests are secretly to keep API free to allow for free LLM training. Who is really behind the mass protests as AI has not been mentioned at all in the big subreddits protests/going-dark posts.
 99% of people don't realize the API changes are meant to disallow big AI conglomerates to easily scrap reddit to train AI on our data for profit
 I dont want my data to be used to train a LLM, only to be charged to use this LLM when it comes out.

I've had to fight my way around getting the domains transferred to other hosts this week so wanted to drop a note out as a heads up for others who may be in the same boat but not realise it yet.
 They are a reseller of enom.com for .com domains and they would help for those. For .co.uk Nominet will assist with getting you access to your records.
 If you are impacted, good luck and may you get records migrated with minimal fuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope you guys can help. 
 I'm going to struggle to explain this, but ill do my best.
 We have the below set up 
 Cisco Router -> Fortinet -> 2 x Aruba -> 2 x legacy netgear switches 
 I'm aware that the Fortinet is set up as DHCP server which give out a range 10.157.....
 but when I connect to the Netgear switches they hand out 192.168.000 
 I think the netgears switches are running a DHCP service on them which is handing the 192 range out, but my question is 
 Why are the Arbuas not pulling an IP range from the netgears and or vice versa?

 I've got a share (Data_Shares) with around 25 sub folders inside it and currently everyone has access to all sub folders. How it works is Domain Users grouo has access at Data Shares top level and all sub folders have inherited permissions. 
 But now i want to make 5 secure folders. Do i just disable inhertiance on these 5 sub folders, remove DomainUsers group and add security group (with correct users in).
 I have access based enumeration on Data_Shares so it's going to hide the folders for anyone not in. Just want to check that's the way to go disable inhertiance on the selected sub folders?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to find a solution to a weird issue I've been having for a few days now, and this is my last hope. I've got a pair of SRX340 firewalls which I acquired in order to replace a pair of dell R330 boxes running PFSense. The goal here is to use them just for an IPsec tunnel into our GCP environment.
 As a precursor, the current PFSense boxes are in operation with one GCP tunnel each, sharing a GCP VPN gateway. When I run an iperf test over them, I can get up to 600mbps per tunnel. Plenty for what I need.
 However, when running a simple configuration in a test environment using the Google community guide for SRX devices, I'm only getting ~230mbps of possible bandwidth over the firewall. To be clear on this example, it's one SRX340 with one tunnel to GCP, dynamic routing, a gigabit WAN connection with a static IP on ge-0/0/0, and I have a laptop plugged into ge-0/0/1 on the device to run iperf3 over. Without the SRX340 in the mix, I can get 930mbps iperf3 over the internet to my test VM in GCP.
 My issue is with the 230mbps number. The SRX340 is rated for up to 733mbps of IPsec bandwidth, and I'm running the configuration given as an example in the Google guide. I just can't seem to break that speed barrier. Am I missing something or is this what I'm to expect out of an SRX340?

 Tiny resume:
 Reedit is changing its API price (up to 20 million $ per year) to the third party apps that offers accessibility to ddisabled people, no ads, no porn, and also it offers better tools for subreddit moderation, things that the official reddit app doesn't.
 Basically the blackout consist in going "dark" 2 days, from 12th to 14th. (or indefentely, some communities like r/ProgrammerHumor prefers to go dark indefentely)
 I hope this doesn't break any rule, if so mods please feel free to delete my post but at lease consider what people is gonna vote. 
 Since we are sysadmins, i think we could join this blackout, we know how much painful can be this type of things irl, so i think we could join them.

 I am facing a terrible delay when connecting from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 20.04 via Windows Remotedesktopconnection. My download speed is 60-80 Mbps and upload 20-30 Mbps. Ping to the remote machine says 25ms. I've tried to do some configurations on Remotedesktopconnection window such as colour depth, bitmap caching etc but no success. Writing code has a delay of 0-0.5 seconds and opening folders with >100 images takes 1-3 seconds. Opening or just dragging a single image takes 1-3 seconds as well. I do not own the remote machine so changing configurations over there might be limited. Is this sort of delay a common issue when trying to connect a windows 10 with a ubuntu 20.04 machine? Should I consider switching to windows as well for my remote system?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Seeking opinions. I'll keep out some of the details to keep it short. I need to get a redundant/backup internet carrier at a very important site for our small/med enterprise. It is a warehouse location. The wrinkle is that we are leaving this site in approximately one year, but up until that time it is crucial that if one ISP dies another is available. Our current provider is actually the cable company, who has an enterprise fiber division. The only other provider in the building is the legacy RBOC who has fiber.
 I have been getting quotes through a telco broker who works with multiple different companies that use the RBOC as the last mile/loop, but they either refuse to quote 1 year or the pricing is very high (over $1000) even for speeds like 50 or 100Mb. I have looked at satellite internet services which seem too slow. I have looked at 5G broadband, but my hesitation is that they seem to offer no guarantee as to speed or performance. The fine print literally says there is no minimum speed. I need at least 50Mb up and down to run the business in the event of a failover. Another option is business (not enterprise) class cable modem, from the same provider as my current service. I inquired about redudnancy/separation between the two services, they did not get too deep into detail but admitted that they did potentially share some of the same equipment.
 So what would you do?
 A) Get the wireless broadband service, and hope it doesn't suck horribly when needed
 B) Get the cable modem and hope the services don't ever go down at the same time
 C) Bite the bullet and try to convince ownership that we should pay the $1000 per month for the backup service, which is more than we pay for our primary service. The internet in this location has not gone down for at least 5 years, but if it did and we didn't have a working backup it would definitely cost the company more than $12,000 if it was down for a day.
 Thanks

 I've been playing around with Netbox to demo, and I've been importing our addressing and VLANs. My concern is with how VLANs are handled. It seems like it's not possible to say "vlan 1 is globally Desktops,' for example, and have all org-wide site-specific Desktop prefixes be assigned to, and appear under, the same VLAN object. Is this correct? 
 Right now I have (for example) a "site_vlans" vlan group for multiple sites, and an individual "vlan 1" assigned to each group/site. This is all well and good, but suppose you have 100 VLANs and 10 sites. Are you required to maintain 1000 VLAN records in Netbox? Seems unwieldy.

 Currently we're using Kerberos and the CIO wants to put a RADIUS server instead (+ 802.1X.)
 I've a given solution but for my thesis and as a beginner I'm trying to figure it out why would we replace kerberos by a RADIUS.
 And more I search and more I'm convince that Kerberos is better ??
 (info we are 250 people)
 For now I found that :
 Kerberos in highly secure, provide two factor auth, SSO
 And for RADIUS honeslty I mainly found that it's "easier" to manage, no really technical advantage.
 I'm really trying to have an critical POV about this to justify the need to replace kerberos, and first I tried to answer the question "Why would I build up a central server with all credentials ?"
 Because it's what mainly I understood about RADIUS and I thought I'll found instead "this is an hyper secure proven solution" and not just some "easier to manage" stuff.
 And I'm bewildered... 
 Maybe I'm wrong or not considering the real need ?
 Thx

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Friday everyone, 
 So, I manage a hotel's Wifi service. A recent change I made for them was to set their QoS bandwidth cap for their free GUEST wifi network to 10Mbps. After applying the update, I went to the hotels lobbies to test it out with my laptop. Interestingly enough, I'm getting on avg. about 4-6Mbps speeds and I'm also seeing that it will fluctuate from 5Mbps, then burst to 8Mpbs, then back to 4Mbps and so on and so on. I'm assuming this is normal behavior you see when you've placed a bandwidth cap on the wifi network, but I'm not 100% on this. If not, let me know.
 When I'm on the casino floors, I'm getting correct QoS speeds (The property is a hotel & Casino), I'm also seeing burst here and there but overall speeds are right on the money.
 Currently using Cisco WLC3504 with Cisco 2802i APs.
 This might be an easy answer for some of you Wireless Cisco ninjas. I appreciate any thoughts and inputs you might have.
 ​
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am working in a company which develops safety-critical application. The company (railway operator) which uses our system in the field wants us to join their already deployed MPLS network. In this case, we need to share the network infrastructure with other systems like CCTV, IP phone etc. Otherwise we are going to install our closed loop for communication between control center and remote equipments, which is a general approach we have taken so far. Our concerns for sharing the common network devices with other systems are bandwidth, latency and security.
 As far as I know CCTV data is prioritized in MPLS QoS. Can our safety-critic data be prioritized higher than CCTV packets?
 Also in case of a failure in other subsystems, may a technician misconfigure the MPLS router in a troubleshooting process so that our routing configuration also be affected badly?
 I remember that with RSVP, pre-defined bandwidth can be allocated to a specific tunnel, can we rely on that?
 The good side of entering to MPLS network is that we don't need to spend a great amount of equipment cost to deploy our separate network. Also we won't need to worry for failures and maintenance.
 In case we decide to involve to MPLS network, we need some commitments from operator on bandwidth reservation and max latency we are going to experience, right?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am hoping to get some feedback on how to improve my HA setup between my active/passive FortiGates, and a Cisco Nexus vPC pair acting as the layer3 core. 
 Here is the topology with relevant config:
 https://i.ibb.co/hcmxVTs/Forti-Gate-Nexus.png
 Each FortiGate has two interfaces configured in an aggregate (ports 2 and 4). FortiGate1's ports 2 and 4 are plugged into Nexus1's ports 1 and 2. The same is done for FortiGate2.
 When I added the second Nexus, I initially tried connecting port 2 from each FortiGate into the same Nexus, and port 4 from each FortiGate into the other. However, this caused unexpected behavior. I can't exactly recall what happened, as there were a number of issues I was troubleshooting during this time.
 Fast forward a few months, I noticed Po5 was down on Nexus1, and Po4 was down on Nexus2. I removed these port channels and quickly realized this caused an outage.
 I have an opportunity for a maintenance window this weekend and would like to improve this setup if possible. Would anyone who has implemented a similar topology be willing to expand on their HA configuration?
 Many thanks!

 I have a service running in VLAN1000, lets say it's a webserver. I have forwarded 443/tcp from my WAN interface to this machine, and it works fine from the outside.
 From VLAN5, however, it doesn't work properly. It requires either split horizon DNS or hairpin NAT. I'm currently using split horizon DNS, but that only works for machines were I can control DNS, which I can't for some computers. It also doesn't work with some services just using IPs.
 I'd like to implement a hairpin NAT rule which works with my dynamic WAN IP. I can't find any relevant documentation on this, but I'm probably missing something obvious.
 How do I implement this?

 I've been able to get a VPN tunnel established between an ASA 5555-X with Public Static IP Address and a Cisco RV320 which has a 4G LTE (Verizon) USB modem attached. It completes Phase 1 and Phase 2 setup of the VPN tunnel but I'm not getting any data to pass. The ASA side show #pkts encaps and #pkts encrypted counters increasing but the #pkts decaps never increase from 0.
 The RV320 shows its IP Address is 100.121.189.168, however that is not the IP I'm using to establish the tunnel. I'm using the address that I see when going to ipchicken.com. Of course, the RV320 doesn't have the best debugging/logging capabilities.
 Any ideas if this is possible?

 As an example, if I were to go give permissions to a shared mailbox, when I go to delegation and add, it completes and I have to close the window out, if I also need to apply send as permission, I have to go back into the mailbox to do so where in the "classic" admin center, everything can be done in the popup window without closing anything. This function is no longer available in the classic admin center.
 I know it's a minor annoyance and yes, I do use powershell more often than not to accomplish some of these tasks, I know Microsoft is gonna Microsoft but some of the changes are just so annoying. I think things like message trace are better here but overall, I don't know what they were thinking with some of the changes.

If there is an issue with a specific subnet a 3rd party contacts these groups/users to notify them about a problem with their subnet. What do you guys usually use or would recommend using for this? 
 We are currently looking at Nautobot as it supports Infoblox integration. But as far as I can tell it does not support users/groups for subnets either. Currently we are using an old database with basically all manual entry which is less than ideal.

 I've got users using various versions of outlook (some as old as 2010...) but they have periodically asked me if there's some alternative to rebooting their computer to address extreme sluggishness in outlook (e.g., just clicking on a new message has a big delay).
 These computers have tons of available memory and and restarting the app doesn't help so I suspect there's some windows service I need to restart which outlook if relying on that is causing the issue.
 ​
 Do you know what service it is?
 I'd prefer not to tell people to reboot their whole computer to address this issue
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 ​
 In the era of WFH and remote connections, I wanted to put this idea out to the community.
 ​
 What do you think of an auto-detecting VPN client? (or an auto-detect feature built into the vpn client)
 ​
 What I was thinking was:
  
The VPN client when connected would work as its supposed to with routing policies and things of that nature
 When the VPN client is not connected it would monitor traffic based on policies and rules and when it detects that the system is attempting to connect to a resource on the destination network that is only available through VPN it would prompt to connect
 The idea is that people would be able to stay off the VPN and only initiate a connection when its required.
 Further it would reduce IT helpdesk tickets because rather than logging an IT ticket when they can't access a resource, only to find they haven't connected to VPN, the client application would pop up with a notice "looks like you're trying to connect to your workplace, would you like to connect?"
 The user could click yes or no and if they click yes then it would initiate the connection sequence (prompt for password, mfa, etc.)
  
​
 what do you guys think? let me know in the comments

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who had admined Teams phones, you'll know that even with autosign in there are times the devices sign out. Users press buttons, bad updates happen, or in some cases they just seem to randomly sign out. Every teams admin I've ever talked to usually starts by confidently saying they don't have that problem before coming back later in the conversation and saying something similar to "Well we did have a few devices sign out but that was because the password expired" or similar. 
 If you're familiar with Kari's law the basic premise is that there can be no barrier whatsoever to dialing 911. If it's a phone, you should not have to dial an outside line or take any special action to dial. But if you look at a teams phone, every single one says "Sign in to make an emergency call"
 How is that legal? I genuinely do not understand how, or how people are getting around this. Surely if an organization is using teams as a phone system with physical phones they're non compliant with Kari's law? 
 What am I missing? Even with auto sign in there isn't a way to 100% guarantee a phone wont get signed out. 
 I get that there's other issues here that need to be addressed. The need for cellular backup in case the internet goes down, or backup power for the phone system. And yes, I fully understand 'most people just use their cellphones', but I'm specifically wanting to address teams phones in this context because the way I see it, there's no way to be compliant with Kari's law unless you have someone physically checking each and every phone multiple times a day, even if it's in the hallway rather than being assigned to a user.

A 39-year-old Florida man pleaded guilty Tuesday to selling hundreds of millions of dollars of counterfeit Cisco gear to unsuspecting schools, hospitals, government agencies, and the military.
 According to the US Justice Department, between 2013 and 2022 Onur Aksoy, based in Miami, founded at least 19 companies in New Jersey and Florida and launched 15 Amazon and 10 eBay storefronts from which he peddled "tens of thousands" of low-quality or faulty networking devices gussied up to look like new or official Cisco equipment.
 The goods, imported from sellers in China and Hong Kong, were often loaded with pirated Cisco software and packaged within Cisco boxes bearing Cisco labels and stickers. Documentation was also made to look legitimate, the Justice Department said.
  
I'm sure it will only be a matter of time before some of the big name suppliers start using this guy as a scare tactic to funnel sales back their way.

 Looking for help of the collective group as something surely has to exist already for this…
 We have an operations team that is 24x7. They respond and action to various alerts. My team has developed very detailed process on how to respond to these alerts (ex. device down). The process is currently documented in a flow chart and we’re looking at next steps to bring this to our Operations Team.
 I’d love to be able to have something that is user input driven - I’m imagining something web-based that prompts them for Yes or No / Choice A or B type inputs and then leads them to the next steps.
 For example…device down…. Is there an active change being performed by the Network Team or vendor? (Yes/No). Based on the selection the next input would be something like… IF No… Is it a single device down or multiple… and so on.
 I’d love this format over something like an incredibly long word document with anchors.
 Here’s an example of something that I found - albeit maybe really out and outdated(?) - that paints a picture.

 And the answer was, at a quick glance, pretty OK. (below). Given chatgpt's ability to make plausible stuff up, I'm not sure if this is a great thing or aa world of pain lying in wait.
 When dealing with an oversized transaction log file in Microsoft SQL Server, the following steps can be taken to address the issue when the shrink command does not reduce the file size:
  
Check the database recovery model: Ensure that the database is in the full or bulk-logged recovery model. If it is set to the simple recovery model, the transaction log will not shrink.
 
Backup the transaction log: Create a backup of the transaction log using the BACK…]]></summary>

 I have a 2012R2 server (Last one in production with update planned prior to soon EOL) which still has Flash Active X installed. KB4577586 has been set to install in WSUS for all device groups and has installed succesfully on all other servers and endpoints. 
 I've also tried manually downloading from the Microsoft update catalog but when ran i'm told "this update is not applicable on your computer".
 Anyone else had similar? Recent updates continue to install no issue including all monthly and the recent quarterly security roll-ups.

 I asked if he was only going to block it for a couple days as part of the blackout but apparently he got the permanent block approved by the VP. It won't be accessible on their internal network or their guest wifi, and he's expecting to piss off a few people with this change.
 We discussed setting similar blocks in our home networks for a couple days and seeing how we do - thought that might appeal to a few people here since it looks like this sub will be staying up. You might also consider setting up blocking at work as well if that's plausible. I work for a giant megacorp so I'm not even going to try, but having worked at some small places it's definitely something I would have put forth there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I stumbled over the new features that Microsoft tries to implement in Windows and Office 365. 
 Especially the "new" Outlook app. The "new" app looks basically Outlook.office.com but as a Modern app. Most Add-Ins didn't work like online and in general the app felt worse then the Web app. 
 A few days ago I heard in a webcast, that Microsoft probably does not continue the development of active directory which could result in an push towards Azure AD.
 Today I read about upcoming changes to the explorer and the "Home menu" looks like the start Menu from Microsoft 365. 
 This all feels like Microsoft wants to force users to get in touch with the existing cloud infrastructure and wants to push the cloud services more than only migrating Server VMs to azure. 
 This scenario is quite unrealistic, but I think this could be happening more in the future. 
 Does anybody feel the same way?

 Wednesday, a recruiter cab called me to asks if I was potentially interested in new offers. I told yes, then he told me he has a DevOps offer. So, I am working as system & network admin since 2.5 years in my company (its my first job, i'm 24). The thing is they were looking for an experienced DevOps, which im obviously not.
 So, they anyways wanted to meet me, yesterday eve I went to the company (~150 employees), they told me they were considering taking me as mid-time DevOps & mid-time sysadmin at the beginning to help me getting skills on DevOps, and after some months if needed, I would be a full DevOps.
 The point is they have also needs on sysadmin side, and Im pretty much experimented on sysadmin, so all of this sounds fair to me, the business looks nice, great office, great work schedule, everything.
 Does this offer sounds really fair? Is it a redflag? Is there something I should really be care of? Whats you guys opinion on it? (I am really about to accept)

 I have an issue with opendkim. The problem is that it allows emails without attachments from the sender, but it blocks emails with attachments from the same sender. The sender is using O365.

 So my question is: If I pass my CCNA test, should I start looking for a job that needs a network guy or stay for a year or two so employers don't question why I'm hopping my job so fast? 
 Thanks for your advice

 So I boot via USB and chose recover, it takes about 2 hours to scan the USB for a recovery file, it finds it and then when I say to execute it I get error "The system restore has failed. No disk that can be used for recovery can be found"
 Now the internet has a variety of answers, from WSB is deprecated and won't work, all the way to attempting to partition and format the drives exactly as they were.
 Second issue, I don't know how to determine how many partitions and exactly their sizes. 
 Can any of you syswizards help me out here?
 I am absolutely trying to avoid manually installing and rebuilding of the server due to so many 3rd party integrations and exe.

 I'm assuming they're just scraping job sites and trying to make a quick buck, but does anyone go for these jobs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello readers,
 I have a AS5400XM Gateway (old, very old, lol), that is currently password locked. There's no documentation whatsoever. Whether it be online or at work. I use SuperPuTTy and am reverse SSH over an AYSYNC line. I have absolutely no idea as to why I'm not able to break into ROMMON, first off, the unit boots really fast lol, and second there is no text direction in the CLI telling me what break combination to use. 
 ​
 I have one last idea and that is am going to use reverse Telnet over the AYSYNC lines and use the "Special Commands" drop down in SuperPuTTy.
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated! 
 ​
 THANK YOU!!

I am reminding myself of the various switches that make DCDIAG spit out useful things and in the course of doing so, stumbled on documentation about ADREPLSTATUS which looks like a handy-dandy tool for just this kind of thing. 
 But, as Murphy would have it, Microsoft's article about it opens with:

 I had on my calendar to do this in August around the 3-month mark but with the uncertainty of my continued presence on reddit I'm going to do it now. 
 I realize I'm still in the "honeymoon" phase but so far I'm loving every aspect of the new role. The hours are flexible, my boss and the team is amazing, I'm learning a ton, and possibly most of all am taking a huge step forward in my career.
 I won't say there haven't been challenges, going from a company of 80 to one of 350k means a lot of bureaucracy. Still waiting for some higher-level access to my laptop but at least I have an Azure VM I can work in with full admin rights. 
 I will also note, probably unsurprisingly, this is the first week I've felt like I can actually contribute to the team. I setup an Azure VM for one of the offshore folks and was able to do a DB restore and push to Azure SQL for some mock data.
 Anyway, yeah that's about it at the moment. Happy to answer questions if I can without doxing myself and all that happy crap.
 Oh, and I will re-iterate from the last time, the outpouring of support from this community was amazing and I truly appreciated all the positive comments and good will. 
 Cheers!

 I have been tasked to write up an “IT Security Overview” to educate a potential new insurer. I have an idea where to start but I could easily make it way to complicated. I am good at that. My idea is to focus it at c-level execs so I can use it for more than one purpose. 
 Some Items I want to include but not limited to
  
 VPN vendor 
  vendor list in general
  MFA status on all services (internal and external)
  Server and Windows Versions
  what outdated software/hardware we have (none)
  Our backup strat (mediums, encryption, testing schedule)
  potentially ACLs on VLANs and VPNs?
  past infections/any data loss (none)
  software update schedule 
 maybe even as far as what firewalls we use. 
  
Does anyone have any other thoughts?
 thanks for listening!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I was managing multiple systems using remote desktop. The desktop I had to use only had one monitor so I had to keep switching between my local desktop and the remote desktop windows. A really annoying issue with this type of setup is using keyboard shortcuts (combinations) in windowed mode for remote desktop is the short cut (i.e. Window+R, Windows+E, etc...)would apply to the local desktop instead of the remote host.
 So I decided to take a look at the advanced settings for RDP and found a setting that I don't remember being there last time I looked (many years ago), and under "Local Resources" > "Apply Windows key combinations" was the solution to this annoying issue. There you can select the option to apply the keyboard shortcuts/combinations to the remote computer, instead of "Only when using the full screen".
 I figured I would share, because I mentioned this to some of my teammates and they didn't know about this setting either.
 Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the Gold award!

 I was looking at the networked devices the other day at work and came across a Chevy Suburban hopping between access points. My two thoughts were, "I really need to change the Wi-Fi password" and "Cars can connect to Wi-Fi now?" I blocked it from the network without a second thought.
 Today I get a ticket in saying, "If you have the time today, my picture frame isn’t on the wifi anymore.
 I was just wondering if you could fix it." I tried throwing in the password to no avail. It just wouldn't take. I reset the device, turned Wi-Fi off, nothing. It finally clicked that the digital picture frame was being listed as a Chevy Suburban in my connected devices! It was a quick switch to unblock it, and I got a nice lesson in Don't do stuff without knowing what you're doing.

The server needs to be retired and I need a way to copy over all 18 TB of data to a new machine. My options are migrating the data to either a new Windows Server or a Synology NAS.
 The old server has only about 1 TB of space left, so P2V tools like disk2vhd wouldn't work (assuming that the VM has to created on the server itself). Veeam is also not an option, since its client doesn't support the old OS. I looked into Synology's "Active Backup for Business", but I've never used it and I'm not sure if it would work.
 What do you think is the best option? I'd really appreciate some advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks, I’m a networking novice and just looking for some help troubleshooting an issue I’m having with the network I maintain/administrate for an event production company. Network is fairly simple with just a handful of VLAN’s, RSTP, DHCP reservations/assignments, and IGMP snooping. 
 Now, onto the setup; switch (Cisco CBS-350 8 port switch in a touring enclosure) has just two VLANs active: VLAN 11 and VLAN 21, with VLAN 1 being the native VLAN as per Cisco standard. One PC on VLAN 11, and one device functioning as a ping responder on VLAN 21. 
 The problem I’m having is the pc on VLAN 11 is able to ping the gateway for VLAN 21, as well as ping the device on VLAN 21 (though the ping only makes it TO the other device, it is not able to be sent back to VLAN 11). Problem only seems to arise when the PC is provided an IP with DCHP, when the PC is set to static IP in the same range I’m unable to ping the gateway of other VLANs. Feel free to ask any questions about the setup that I may not have answered, I’m sure I missed some things. TIA.

Up until now I have used Raritan, but they seem to be completely unable to deliver any devices.

 I would like them to have dual LAN ports for resilience, Dual PSU and connect to the Console port using a standard CAT5 with no adapters. Up to 48 ports.

We already have 3x /24 public IP blocks on hand but some of those IPs have servers assigned to them already. my question is, do i still need to acquire another /24 block just for bgp use or can we use what we currently have? i guess i'm stuck on the 'advertise' part. my thinking is we're advertising routes a'la ospf, but to the world this time. 
 i apologize if this sounds elementary. i'm working with a contractor overseas so i'm basically the remote hands and in charge of fulfilling requirements, etc. this is my first time working on bgp as you can tell.

 ​
  
Advertise 1st /24 + /23 ISP-A
 Advertise 2nd /24 + /23 ISP-B
  
Would the longest match prefix rule be considered ahead of BGP best path ? In this scenarios ISP-A is Cogent and ISP-B is Lumen. Would advertising the /23 provide failover in the event one side was lost ? One last thought, would the IP range being owned by the end user vs it being leased from a providers range impact this. Say you leased the /23 via Lumen and its part of /16 supernet they advertise via their own AS. This is just a hypothetical although I did once see something similar to this in production and did not have chance to verify if it actually worked as intended.
 ## ISP A - BGP # Inbound: Default Route # Outbound: 30.0.0.0/24 30.0.0.0/23 ## ISP B - BGP ## # Inbound: Default Route # Outbound: 30.0.1.0/24 30.0.0.0/23

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to replace a Netgear GS748Tv4H1 switch that's been in production since 2012. It has worked well (with the exception of a fan replacement a few years ago) but I recently deployed a new batch of workstations that have Intel i225/226 ethernet ports. For some unexplained reason, these computers will show "Network disconnected" unless I manually set the link speed to 10Mb. My troubleshooting process has narrowed it down to some issue with the Netgear switch. Anyway, management has approved a replacement switch, and I was rather hoping to find something that has at least some 2.5Gb ports as the PC's with the i225/226 ports all support that speed. Most of the cables have already been replaced with CAT6 already.
 No fancy networking scenarios here, just a single location of 40 or so mixed devices and the only requirement is LACP for the link aggregates on two Windows servers and a NAS. I will have to replace the WiFi setup as well so the 2.5Gb ports will come in handy for that and POE would be a plus but not a requirement. Having researched for the past few days I've come up with these:
 Juniper EX2300-48MP (16 x 2.5 GbE ports)
 EnGenius ECS2552FP (16 x 2.5 GbE port)
 FS S5800-48MBQ (48 x 2.5 GbE ports)
 People seem to have fairly positive things to say about the Juniper and I'm leaning that way (if I can find it in stock anywhere in Canada). However, I'm just wondering if I'm getting myself into a much more complicated situation that requires support contracts and subscriptions to cloud things and other enterprise-y stuff that I don't need. I abandoned Cisco years ago because the beancounters didn't want to pay for the yearly support contract and I couldn't get any firmware updates after that. I did have an account rep at CDW that I would go to for info but seems they're ghosting me. Am I fine just purchasing the hardware or should I really try to find a different VAR to make sure I'm getting everything I need?

 My reasoning is that commercial VPNs, like NordVPN or others won't work, as they typically have the same IP addresses and can be detected that way.
 The home VPN, however, should in theory not be distinguishable from a "regular" connection.
 Is my assumption correct, or are there other factors that could give out the information that a user is connected through a VPN?

It suggested I also add a memorable number to the end of my password so I decided to just put my current age. For some reason, finally using a password manager felt like a big moment. I remember making that password vividly. I remember exactly where I was, what the furniture looked like, etc.
 Now every day when I enter my master password I realize how much time has passed. I'm coming up on a decade since and every time I get further from that number, my mortality sets in. I can't believe it's been a decade from that point in time. I would not recommend it.
 Which brings me to my main question; how often do you change your master password if at all? Any system for doing so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My head of security wants to explore virtual desktops specifically for contractors, to reduce the need for us to ship expensive laptops to contractors that require access to company systems, which is what we're doing now.
 I haven't explored the VDI space in about 10 years, though I'm familiar with some of the more common solutions like Windows 365 and VMWare. However I haven't worked with any of them or tested any of their offerings recently.
 The basic idea is that these contractors don't need a specific operating system since almost all of our services are web based, and we'd issue them a low(er) cost device like a Chromebook in lieu of a Macbook if they actually needed hardware, or they could access the VM securely via a personal computer.
 Can anyone comment on modern solutions?

 They will not provide us a list of devices and firmwares and instead work with auditors directly. It is kind of crazy.
 But the question I have is all of our 20 or so locations have ancient dumb Cisco ISRs (1900s I believe) - these are all on a MPLS network that go to some kind of Fortinet gateway in their data center.
 Each location has a simple flat VLAN (they refuse to budge on this), so these devices don't really do any routing, the gateway/MPLS would handle all of that.
 Still I am wondering what kind of vulnerablities or risks this might bring.
 We and other orgs are leaving them for a SD-WAN+ZTNA/Zscaler setup, but that won't be for some time.

 Now all of a sudden several users are complaining that SSO does not work, regardless of using Chrome or Edge. It doesn't matter which user logs on to the computer, SSO still will not work, and the user has to type in username and password.
 If we run "gpupdate /force /target:computer" on the problematic computer, SSO works just fine.
 If user restarts computer the same problem occurs again, until "gpupdate /force /target:computer" is run again.
 Configuration is correct,
  
Integrated Windows Authentication is enabled
 
Automatic logon only in Intranet zone is enabled on the Intranet zone settings (user settings GPO)
 
The urls of the websites belong to the intranet zone
 
 Does anyone know what could be causing this intermittent fall out of SSO, or if there are tools that can be used to troubleshoot/log the reason why it's not working, when it stops working? 
 Clients are running Win10 Enterprise 21H2.

 Have a client that houses people with mental health conditions. Some of those people have suffered through scams ending with them losing thousands of dollars to people pretending to be women. 
 Asking here and a few other places. 
 Do you know of any resources or technology that could help prevent or react to this type of situation? 
 They're using personal devices on a personal network with little supervision. Don't know if there's a technical answer here or if we're just stuck with reinforcing on the social side.

 After years of battling with the Marketing/Graphic department and their 20 To of data. I installed Photoprism in Docker and showed the Manager the logic of looking for a tool instead of our flat file server windows 2019. the file server have a basic setup, shares, NTFS, and a lot of folders et sub folders. lots of duplicates...
 Ideally:
 selfhosted software
 open source able to connect to the NTFS share to index
 multi users with rights access
 capable of handling videos, pictures, RAW photo format, adobe suite format
 auto tagging, duplicate finding tool, poll system, etc etc
 project management solution or link available with one? ( i know it exist some software special for marketing people where they can push automatically their photoshop (adobe suite) file to a portal and create workflow for approval by the other teams 
 thanks a lot for any idea

 recently set up a VPS server with Windows Server 2022 featuring 8 CPU Threads, 8GB RAM.
 Using it for trading and stuff, so nothing wild performance wise, this is also reflected in the task manager with around 20-30% CPU usage and 50-60% RAM usage.
 But nonetheless, if accessed via MS RDP, it's almost unusably unresponsive and laggy. Sometimes things don't react to mouse clicks at all but as I said, the apps and stuff run smoothly, it's only the GUI.
 Is this a limitation of RDP, are 3rd party apps more suitable (like AnyDesk, TeamViewer and stuff). Or can RDP be tuned?
 Internet connections are fast (100 and 400 Mbit's for me and server) and the server is not too far away from me.
 Thanks for your help!

 we have a fairly simple configuration for Kuberntes ingress: aws alb receive in 443, forward to 80, and then move traffic to nginx ingress controllers that has services on the 80.
 up until now i never had a problem like this one, snipeit its driving me crazy, the only thing i can get from its ingress is a gateway timeout, and this happens only for its url, all the other applications are working
 log from the ingress controller:
 networking nginx-ingress-nginx-controller-x7j7v controller 2023/06/08 10:50:09 [error] 857#857: *22661 upstream timed out (110: Operation timed out) while connecting to upstream, client: client, server: snipeit.staging.k8s.domain, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "upstream", host: "snipeit.staging.k8s.domain" 
 pod of snipeit doesnt log anything sadly, im using the latest image since i have ARM cluster.
 thats my "proxy" configuration for snipeit, but i tested really almost everything and im starting to thing is a strange combo.
 APP_ALLOW_INSECURE_HOSTS: "true" APP_FORCE_TLS: "true" APP_TRUSTED_PROXIES: "**" APP_LOG_LEVEL: "debug" SECURE_COOKIES: "true" APP_URL: "https://snipeit.staging.k8s.domain" 
 here the ingress configuration:

 also for refernce im using this chart. ; thank you in advance for whatever info you have.

 I'm looking into moving most of our project files into the cloud but after googling a bit it looks like a 50/50 risk where latency will be an issue because of how large they are. I bumped into azure file sync and wondering if anyone here has any success/fail experience with that? Also any testimonies where going to Azure for Autodesk programs would be great. FYI we do use bim collaborative for all new projects but have a lot of legacy projects that mgmt refuse to move over.

 It is the first time I have looked at the switch (SG-500-52) since joining the company and the current manager doesn't know the password. We don't have any records for it. As a result, I am trying to run through the password recovery process.
 I am connected via DB9 into switch console port, DB9 to USB adapter into laptop. The adapter shows up as COM3 on device manager. I have followed the instructions for the baud rate, data bits etc but everytime I connect via Putty I just get a black screen.
 COM3 shows at the top and if I unplug the cable I get an error message. I have tried multiple different baud rates and a couple different drivers for the adapter cable but no luck.
 The only other thing I can think of trying is power cycling the switch whilst connected but I am not allowed to do that during office hours. Any ideas besides this?

 thanks for reading!
 I have an application running on a Windows Server with does not support any authentication at all. Therefore I build an IIS reverse proxy in front of it which is using Windows authentication. Everything worked fine until a new addon was installed to the application. Now, I am always sent back to the Windows authentication pop up when trying to open the addon page and gives me a 401 error although entering the right credentials. For me it looks like there is some kind of username / password coming with the link to the new module which kills my authentication.
 As soon as I change IIS from Windows authentication to Anonymous authentication it works.
 Here are the IIS logs (anonymized)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So what I'm looking for is something that emulates the functionality of say MDT or FOG Project but that's entirely mobile, can be run from bootable media/local storage and doesn't require a server-side application that client devices have to interface with (preferably, the image files can be stored anywhere and then copied to storage media that is connected to the devices that require imaging).
 This would be used exclusively for imaging devices with Windows 10/11 Pro and customising the images to include the usual suite of client/environment specific additions: drivers, applications, Windows configuration, etc.
 The closest solution I can think of is NTLite but this product goes WAY back and I have no idea whether it's at all relevant, well-supported, still works with Windows 11 and there are security concerns with tools like these given most of them are closed-source. Also, from what I can tell it's exclusively an image-editing solution, so the imaging part of the process still has to be done manually via making bootable USB drives with Rufus for example. I don't believe there are any similar solutions out there that can for example, image devices on the same network from a image repository stored on local storage?
 We have a number of clients with no on-prem server hardware that have fairly unique, extensively-customised OS images with a plethora of industry-specific software on top of that, and they are an absolute time-sink to reimage whenever one of their PCs/laptops is having issues and/or they purchase new hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello i have a problem with my service "Job-Status". I'm a beginner so if i do something wrong don't hesitate to tell it to me I have a poller on CentOS7 and the target is a Windows Server with Veeam running on it. Here's my command : 
 /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_centreon_nrpe -H X.X.X.X -p 5666 -t 120 -u -m 8192 -c check_centreon_plugins -a 'apps::backup::veeam::local::plugin' 'job-status' ' --filter-name="" --filter-start-time="" --filter-end-time="" --filter-counters="" --ok-status="" --warning-status="" --critical-status="" --warning-long="" --critical-long="" '
 The result : 
 Status information CHECK_NRPE: Received 0 bytes from daemon. Check the remote server logs for error messages.
 The snmpwalk work from my poller to the vm. I can telnet the VM from the poller on the 5666 port.
 I tried looking on the web but i don't find any solution directly related to centreon so i don't find any good solution. Thanks you all.

 This is a real long shot, I'm at the end of all my support options! Banging my head against the wall because I am clearly missing something obvious.
 I have two ASAv's in different locations, both with the same split tunneling setup. We have a internet based service that we use OKTA for Authentication and recently implemented a CA policy to restrict out bound networks from accessing.
 What we have discovered is that Location A seems to show OKTA our DC Public IP, Location B it see's their personal public IP.
 If you have a corporate IP you are routed internally to an on-prem appliance to authenticate. This doesn't happen in the other location, you are simply blocked.
 If my route of traffic is to an external internet based application surely OKTA wouldn't see my corporate DC IP. So how on earth does it manage to?!
 Gosh please help, tried explaining this to OKTA and got nowhere,

 Currently we have unifi in the uk, but across the rest of our sites in europe we are using meraki.
 In one of our uk sites we have 30 unifi access points and we plan to add another 10, however we would like to move to meraki eventually.
 If i put 10 meraki ap's into the uk site and configure them the same as the unifi (ssid's, vlans etc) will i have performance issues?
 we don't have the budget to do a full lift and shift, so it would have to be staged if this will work.

 A few observations is that there is a huge disparity between bottom range vendors and top range vendors in terms of price, and that there is a corresponding disparity in terms of tool functionality and Trust-center maturity. Top tier vendors offer some cool functions, but the increase in price was hardly worth it.

 I am looking for free alternatives to Anydesk and Chrome remote desktop. Teamviewer says I should buy a license because I use it often. Anydesk is pretty robust but there is a noticeable lag, which I don't see on Chrome remote desktop. Unfortunately, one of my computers is connected to an new network where I can connect only through proxy. Chrome remote desktop doesn't have an option for proxy manipulation and changing it through the whole system didn't work either. 
 I tried NoMachine but I kept getting problems with the proxy. I gave up since I saw a lot of negative reviews about being slow.

 Long story short, I've received a SNMP-related task and don't really know how to conclude it. I don't have a networking background, I'm mostly a programmer. I'm running Oracle Linux, for info. 
 I need to implement SNMP v3 communication between the user and an agent, which I was able to do and is working as expected. I would like to add an extra layer of security using certificates, and this is the part that I am having issues with. I can generate and sign the certificates just fine, but what should be the content of snmpd.conf? It seems that all I try, the SNMP commands work either with or without the certificates, and I'm not able to find a conclusive example. I feel I'm missing something, any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Odd question but googling has left me with no answers. 
 We currently have O365 and force MFA on every account. Users have downloaded the Microsoft Authenticator app and have added name@companydomain.com to it. 
 Works just fine for logging into O365
 We are about to roll out MFA to the new payroll system but in testing when adding the account via QR code (name@companydomain.com is the login) a second account in the Authenticator is not created and now the onetime passcode that cycles for that account works in both O365 AND the payroll system. 
 How and why?
 If I force a re-registration on O365 it breaks the payroll MFA
 If the user deletes the account from the Authenticator and adds it back it breaks the payroll MFA.
 I would think the onetime code for O365 and payroll system would be different unless they are somehow communicating. 
 Side note: there’s ZERO integration between the two systems. One is managed and maintained by HR and the other is IT.

Long story short the 9300 wasn't about to find its way out of the network the core switch at the site could ping the 9300. They were directly connected via fiber. The 9300 didn't work until I added a static route to the core switch. "ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 "core ip" ". My qestuon is why I do i need to add the default route when I already programmed a default gateway on the 9300. The 3750 has no issues with understand the exit point but 9300 needs that static route when it's only a layer 2 device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I already know the answer to this question. I was having a discussion about design with one of my bosses and I think we are in a disagreement about security best practices and practicality of implementing this type of design. 
 I think its normal to have your data VLAN, voice VLAN, WiFi/Guest VLANs, IOT VLAN, server VLAN, and perhaps others as needed. I also think its normal for a lot, if not all, of this traffic to hairpin to the local firewall. This may add a very slight amount of latency, but its worth it because of the added security letting the firewall inspect, monitor, and log traffic. 
 I think we have fundamental disagreements about network designs. I think hed prefer everything to be as flat as possible, but that is extremely messy. And makes troubleshooting difficult sometimes. As well as implementing changes on the fly. If data and phones are on the same subnet, you can run into QoS issues if you just start throwing on SSL inspection. 
 Anyways, my point is this type of design should not be considered "over-engineered" for even a small to medium sized business. MAYBE a mom/pop shop with 10 employees, a DC, a file server, and a couple printers its overkill. But, otherwise as you start to grow you NEED to take these things into a consideration otherwise it becomes a mess.

I'm all for adding a little spice to the machines but you would have thought being such an expensive device ($3-5k AUD EACH) that they'd at least clean them before sending them out.
 Just wondering whether this is us (Sydney, Australia) or whether we've been feeding down from a bad batch of machines for the last 6mo. We're about to start direct-to-user'ing them with Autopilot and it doesn't exactly make it feel like a great experience. Never had this issue with any other vendor.
 EDIT: pictures of one we received this morning - you'll note the device hasn't been taken out of the plastic wrapper yet

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, sooo, yesterday I got burned really really badly on a Palo Alto pair that I'm migrating traffic across to. Long story short, it was a mistake my end, I had a NAT rule where I wanted it to NAT to the interface address of the outside interface and I had it built like this....
 Original Packet: Src Zone: Inside Dst Zone: Outside Dst Int: e1/1 Scr Address: entire 10/8 range Dst address: any
 Translated Packet: Src Translation: dynamic-ip-and-port Address-object for outside interface IP Dst address Translation: any
 The problem was, the address-object on the translated packet was what is on the outside interface, including the subnet mask of a /28!! Which royally messed everything up! I'm guessing that it was proxy-arping out for all the addresses in that range/subnet and it ended up killing our current live outbound firewalls!
 What I SHOULD have done is have another address-object that was the same address but on a /32, is that right? That's what I have now, but holy fuck am I scared to switch it back on! Even when going through a change!
 I noticed you can set it to translate to the interface address, interface and IP Address as well? Would this do the same as above when I mentioned about what I should've done instead?
 The PA NAT is definitely a different concept when coming from an ASA and Firepower world! And I lost a lot of confidence and have been pretty hard on myself ever since that happened yesterday and not seeing that!
 Would I be alright doing either of the 2 revised ways mentioned?
 The reason why I switched this particular NAT rule on was that its meant to be a catch all for PAT to the interface address, we have a large routed range that is natted to specific public IP's and they're currently live on the ASA's, so I can't enable those specific ones on the PA's yet, so I needed a way to get the outside interface working to test a few VM's in one of the lower end environments

 I already have a Linux Server with Ubuntu image and can ping to the routers with the Cisco Vios image.
 The issue is that I am getting this error, % Unrecognized command

 However, this is a recognized command on the Cisco Vios or the switch but not the router image.
 Is this an issue with Cisco vios image (vios-adventerprisek9-m.spa.159-3)?
 Is there another Cisco router image that is recommended to enable ssh?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On an existing Cisco BGP configuration I want to add a new BGP peer as backup and remove an old one:
 router bgp 54321 bgp router-id 9.9.9.9 neighbor 50.50.50.50 remote-as 7777 neighbor 50.50.50.50 description peer1 neighbor 68.68.68.68 remote-as 7777 neighbor 68.68.68.68 description peer2 neighbor 68.68.68.68 ebgp-multihop 255 ! address-family ipv4 network 9.9.9.0 neighbor 50.50.50.50 activate neighbor 50.50.50.50 weight 300 neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out neighbor 68.68.68.68 activate neighbor 68.68.68.68 weight 100 neighbor 68.68.68.68 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 68.68.68.68 prefix-list deny-all out exit-address-family ! ip prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK seq 5 permit 9.9.9.0/24 ! ip prefix-list default-route seq 5 permit 0.0.0.0/0 ! ip prefix-list deny-all seq 5 deny 0.0.0.0/0 
 Removing 68.68.68.68 and adding 12.12.12.12 it would look something like this:
 router bgp 54321 bgp router-id 9.9.9.9 neighbor 50.50.50.50 remote-as 7777 neighbor 50.50.50.50 description peer1 neighbor 12.12.12.12 remote-as 7777 neighbor 12.12.12.12 description peer2 ! address-family ipv4 network 9.9.9.0 neighbor 50.50.50.50 activate neighbor 50.50.50.50 weight 300 neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out neighbor 12.12.12.12 activate neighbor 12.12.12.12 weight 200 neighbor 12.12.12.12 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 12.12.12.12 prefix-list deny-all out exit-address-family 
 Questions: 
 Why does only the primary peer has "prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out" is this a misconfiguration on the original setup that missed the advertised block on the secondary peer?
 Same question for "prefix-list deny-all out" on the backup peer
 Shouldn't both neighbors have the same config except for weight (300 for primary)?
 EDIT Forgot to add, the new peer is directly connected and shouldn't need multihop so I removed that line

With Unifi switches and AP's. We used to have old cisco switches with a pix firewall.
 Another direction I am being pushed toward is using a Cisco ASA with "Cisco Business" switches.
 For unifi I am concerned about the ability to properly segment the network especially if Layer 3 functionality is required.
 We will need separation for a few things.
  
Keycard entry/door controller. This will only want internet when updates are necessary.
 Security camera VLAN for cameras and DVR.
 VLAN for Employee PCs Laptops Phones.
 Guest VLAN for Guest Wifi
 Possibly an IOT VLAN? (if not placed on the other guest network.) for the Thermostats, Ring Devices Etc.
  
Will Ubiquity/Unifi be able to handle this and keep it secure? Anything I should be concerned about or aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Deep (quick?) question! I’m trying to size servers to host a network monitoring solution and I need to « guestimate » how many sessions per second (on average) you can see going through a 10GBit/s (RX/TX = both direction between two IP addresses, whatever the protocols over that) in an ISP network, a small Data Center network and the network of a Large Enterprise. I know it heavily depends on how many equipments are behind those, but… 🤷🏻‍♂️ - I’m starving for real life data ;-)
 And I know every network is different, but that would help me a lot if you could quote average and peak usages for those kind of networks you might have seen on 10G or even a 25G or 40G network (both North-South and East-West). 
 I looked at research papers, but… I just couldn’t find anything useful. Sometimes I find data on flows per second… but that’s not the same thing and extrapolating numbers isn’t really easy. 
 Can someone (or several someone) help me out on this one or point me to the right direction/ressource?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/
  
Background: Reddit is starting to charge for their API, which means that open-source reddit clients will likely cease to function next month.
 In response, hundreds of subreddits are going dark to remind Reddit that their website is only as valuable as their user's content. And the users want to be able to use open-source apps.
 Can /r/sysadmin join this protest by going dark for 48 hours, starting on June 12th?
 Edit While this subreddit is dark, users can still share and read about critical outages on /c/sysadmin on lemmy as a backup/alternative in the fediverse.

 [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
 This forces powershell to use TLS 1.2 and everything works fine again.
 Just thought I'd share in case your sendgrid emails aren't working - that's likely the culprit!

 We are in a such situation that Aruba TAC basically made everything worse so far.
 We have a customer case that made bracnch users to can't take IP from DC.
 Long story short, I saw there is L2 tunnels between branch and DC clusters. Since the team that commissioned this have no idea about loops, cluster *tunnels* had no redundancy, and one branch cluster member at a time can't connect to DC.
 TAC made tunnel redundancy with full mesh tunnels. No VRRP used anywhere. The problem is since SSID VLAN connected to same L2 domain, network has now big problem, loop.
 I'm looking for solution, since branch load balancing has no issues so far, and SSID not bridge on branch, we need solution for DC side.
 What do you think about ,we should use Aruba tunnel groups, Branch primary tunnels goes to physical address of first DC cluste member and secondary goes to second cluster member.
 Or
 We just use VRRP for branch destination and DC source. I saw a Airheads post about VRRP standby never use this tunnel unless VRRP active realy goes down. So far no loops.
 Any help would be appreciated

 These devices are constantly on the network sending out information to an application. At one of the facilities, the device stopped sending info. So of course we get called. We cannot ping it, can't access the web interface, nothing. The screen on the device itself is still showing good info, it's just not sending it over the network anymore. We get the person on-site to reboot it and it came back up.

 I've created the necessary layer 7 profiles, my question is, what and where would be the best places to apply them?
 At the moment, I'm thinking about putting only the URL based ones on outbound "any" rules and leaving the Anti Virus, Spyware and Vulnerability profiles off since logically they're only really meant for inbound attacks? I guess you could make a case for potential filed that are downloaded and thus the Anti Virus profile would be useful then. Initially I did think about apply all 4 mentioned above there to "any" rules and have the same 3 applied to any rules coming in on the hosted firewalls.
 What are generally, the best ways to do it in everyone's opinion?
 Thanks

 There are no "unused" domains that are available, all domains in question have had previous owners. Can this affect deliverability? What if the previous domain owner used it to broadcast spam?
 ​
 I myself don't send any unsolicited (or even solicited) marketing emails. We basically only respond to customer inquiries within minutes or days at latest. In other words, almost none of our outgoing mail is not a response to an earlier, incoming mail from the corresponding sender.
 However, since it's a support email address, delivery is very very important so we don't want to risk hitting a spam folder with customers then complaining that they haven't received a response yet

 The real question I suppose; does the client now require an Intune license in order for 365 to store Bitlocker keys?

 I have a router set up t get time from and upstream router ad they are sync'd up at a Stratum 2. 
 I am trying to get all my servers below my router to point to my router as their time source. Would I need to have the "ntp master" command in my router so the servers will be able to get the time from my router?
 ​
 This is a Cisco shop with Windows 2019 servers
 I have the ntp keys and the servers configured on my router as well as the ntp source which is my loopback0 interface. and when I run a show ntp status and associations I see that we are sync'd with the servers. I just need the Windows servers to get their time from my router.

 I´m concerned by the use of ChatGPT in my organizations. We have been discussing blocking ChatGPT on our network to prevent users from feeding the Chatbot with sensitive company information. 
 I´m more for not blocking the website and educate our colleagues instead. We can´t prevent them for not accessing the website at home and feed the Chatbot with information.

 What are your thoughts on this?

 I have experience setting DHCP servers before but have never done anything like this before so any resources and guidance or alternative solutions would be helpful 
 I was planning to use ISCSI following directions in the below video but in the comments it said that only 1 client can boot at a time 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_elwqBKIlLI
 The link below says that using ISCSI it can diskless boot multiple client but i cant find any resources or guides on this
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/iscsi/iscsi-target-server
 The goal is to have the clients boot up with a fresh preconfigd os with preinstalled applications every restart 
 Im currently looking at ccboot or dds+ but of course ill look elsewhere first since i need to pay for it
 The server is a HP proliant dl380p gen8 The PCs is a mix of models from HP & DELL

 I was wondering who of you got some good software approval requests processes? Maybe ITIL compliant, maybe not?
 I find the process hard, as there are many factors, costs/cybersecurity/the technical pull for maintenance etc. 
 We do have a good process for big systems, such as CRM etc. but for the smaller ones, time and attendance, task management, plug-ins etc. are a bit complex to handle and results in long approval times for the users, and a lot of no's.
 I was thinking about a software technology board, and to try to shift as much decision power left in the process so the first evaluator can make 90% of the decisions, but I would appreciate if any of you want to share your experiences?
 We are a global company with 800 users.

 Anyway, these are the pages I mainly got my information from:
 https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/MLNXOFEDv471001/OVS+Offload+Using+ASAP2+Direct
 https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/l/architecture-guide-ready-architecture-for-red-hat-openstack-platform-version-16-1-flex-2/sr-iov-ovs-hardware-offload-with-vf-lag
 ​
 My understanding is: VF LAG means two physical ports / physical functions on a card are getting bonded. And then virtual functions of that bonded interface are passed through to VMs.
 And using SR-IOV, the kernel offloads that stuff to the NIC.
 Is my understanding correct?

 I feel like a lot of "stable release" software is starting to behave a lot like beta software and basic functionality is thrown under the tracks just to push out unnecessary updates.
 I was thinking this is was just in gaming, a model where you release a broken piece of software that is somewhat usable only after 6 months of updates but you get your money because people are... people... but I start seeing it in a lot of software nowadays that gets a major update that breaks it for months (looking at you HP and DELL).
 From broken video (dear intel choke on broken always-on dynamic contrast) and audio drivers (waves choke on that out-of-a-barrel-echo) on 1000$ laptops to BIOS settings that don't work properly ??? And crashes in software that was very reliable years ago from big companies like Cisco and Adobe.
 What the hell is going on here ?

I've gotten plenty of (targeted) spam emails and calls, including to my personal cell (last one was from ADP... really? really?). I'm sure y'all get them too. Some of them even say "I got your details from LinkedIn" but they're using details that LinkedIn never had. They're likely getting your info from one of the big B2B services out there. So I went and compiled a quick list of 11 of the largest B2B databases, with the links to their opt-out/delete pages. 
 This is especially useful if you're in CA, but should at least work if you're in the US or EU. All of them will require your (business) email and some other details to process the request, and some are more solid than others. It's also a good idea (if possible) to see what they have on you before requesting the delete -- that's how I found one of them that had my personal cell # attached.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was tasked with building out a new HQ site and was curious as to what folks on here would choose for hardware options if they had the opportunity to greenfield something. I have been a staunch supporter of Arista in the datacenter but the 720 series just don't seem to make sense from a price to performance perspective (7 - 10k for a 24port POE switch...) . I really like Juniper's EX switches and the mist APs have been solid when I have deployed them in the past. However I am already deploying Fortinet / FortiAPs at other locations. I ideally wanted to avoid Cisco and have no experience with Aruba. I was thinking a mix of FortiGate FW \ AP's and Juniper Switches (POE and Access) would probably work but would be curious to hear what other folks would opt for and why. Lets say for this exercise the site is 25k sqft over 4 floors with a comms room on each with structured caballing between comms rooms and to the floor ports. Cable runs for the AP's are already done. The Site will host about 100 - 150 users at peak. All you have to do is choose the hardware configure \ install and manage it. Oh I suppose for external connectivity you could have dual DIA at the site with SD-WAN or P2P circuits to local DC locations if that makes any difference. 
 ​
  
Switches - Juniper EX (POE)
 Firewall - FortiGate 100 or 200f HA
 
Wireless (APs and Controller if required) - FAP-231G (FortiGate as the controller)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the beginner question, pretty inexperienced with certificates.
 We're using PKI/ NDES and Intune/ SCEP. This is set up and user/ machine certificates are flowing to the clients just fine. The user authentication is working fine as well. The issue I'm seeing is machine authentication failing on the login screen. Our NAC (ClearPass) is stating the object cannot be found in the identity store (local AD), which makes sense.
 Is this configuration possible? What would need to be adjusted to make this work?

I've tried every combo of BIOS settings for them (disabling secure boot, etc..). Formatted both in NTFS and ExFat
 Try to boot using Hiren Boot CD? It loads the first frame, but you can't move or select anything
 Try to boot using Windows Media Created USBs, freezes on the first screen
 Try to boot using Windows PE to build a new image, it gets stuck at wpeinit (Initializing). Can't go any further.
 I did confirm it can boot to other situations like a Ubuntu .iso. So I don't think it's the USB file system.
 The laptops in particular are Surfaces 4 and 5 and probably other models. Does anyone have a good idea of what's going on here? I can't figure it out from my coworkers, nor the internet.

All of them were outside salespeople, using their mobile phones with Outlook. So, they saw the name and not the email address so they responded. Then, and this is the new one for me,they received a text message asking them to call him. Their outbound email signature includes their cellphone number, but two of the salespeople who got the text message had not replied to the email.
 They all quickly figured out it was not the owner, so nothing bad happened. What bothers me, other than the contact list leak, is the text messages. A bot campaign sending out phishing emails is not unusual. But, sending text messages is a new one.
 Anyone seen this before?

I'm running into a weird issue for just my machine so far, where it will send my computer certificate but not user. The deployed GPO is basically the same as wireless which works fine and is the same as other machines/users that also work fine, on the same switch (9300L) to the same ISE nodes (2.7) and machines are running Windows 10 22H2. 
 Windows event logs don't show any errors, but I can confirm with a pcap on the workstation that only the machine cert ever leaves it.
 I cannot for the life of me figure out why I can't get it to send my user cert only over wired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Have you tried turning it off and on?" is a common thing IT guys get made fun of for saying, but I mean we kind of deserve it. If it works, use it! I think it's funny that other professions ALSO turn it off and back on, they just don't want to call it that. Like once my mechanic told me to fix an issue with my car we needed to unplug the battery for an hour and then hook it back up. I said "So ... turn it off and turn it back on?" and he was like "no, no, not like a computer" and I just said "suuuure."
 Well this weekend I learned a new one. Saturday evening my heart started racing for no reason. I put on my wife's FitBit and my heart rate was 124, well over the 80 it should have been. I ended up in the ER, and told me my heart was in AFib. Normally when you heart beats, the top part of your heart beats first, then the bottom part beats. In AFib the top part of your heart doesn't beat, it just kind of flutters. For me this meant the bottom part was beating much faster to try and compenstate. 
 I had to have a procedure, and the doctor described it as "We are going to put a tube down your throat to get a better view of your heart, then we are going to give you a drug that will stop your heart for a moment, then we will shock your heart to get it started again, and it should start beating normally." I said "So... turn it off and turn it back on?" He didn't know what to say so I said "It's ok, I am very familar with this process." 
 So there you have it fellow nerds. There is nothing that can't be fixed without turning it off and turning it back on.
 (FYI, the procedure went well and my heart is back to normal. Also I ordered a smart watch that can detect AFib.)

 I have Barracuda Firewalls in Azure VMs and today everything behind that firewall just failed.
 After hours spent on the phone with support. it turns out there was geo update that labeled a certain ip address as coming from Hong Kong. this was an incorrect update. And if you are like my business and block all traffic from certain regions (in this case Hong Kong) then good luck getting in. for the longest time we were scratching our heads as our firewalls appeared functional and fine yet the only way we could communicate with them was through the azure serial console.
 ​
 Solution
 We created an outside VM in our azure environment that we could run the barracuda admin console on and thus make the corrections and exempt the IP address.
 ​
 Barracuda literally learned about this as we called. so, if you call you may have a smaller wait time than I did. thought I'd share the knowledge in case anyone needed it.

 I have recently started taken on additional responsiblity someone who is a co-administrator for a Zabbix monitoring solution. 
 Right now I have run into a wall and I dont entirely know how to solve it, ive tried google, looking up the MIB with google, infact ive wasted the last six hours on this and I need some advice.
 We have a bunch of Juniper SRX 320 routers using VDSL Cards running JUNOS 21.3R1.9 .
 Now I am trying to pull both Bit rate values from the VDSL card using interface pt-1/0/0
 > show interfaces extensive pt-1/0/0 | match bit
 Bit rate (kbps) : 79999 0 20000 0
 The ifIndex of the interface is 539 and running an MIB walk I was able to identify the MIB that corresponds to the 20000 value (the upload speed)
 >show snmp mib walk 1 | match 539
 ifIndex.539 = 539
 ifDescr.539 = pt-1/0/0
 ifType.539 = 97
 ifMtu.539 = 1492
 ifSpeed.539 = 20000000
 ifPhysAddress
 ifAdminStatus.539 = 1
 ifOperStatus.539 = 1
 ifLastChange.539 = 17347
 ifInOctets.539 = 29758270
 ifInUcastPkts.539 = 495971
 +900 more lines ive gone through.
 ifSpeed.539 = 20000000 - This is the value that is the upload speed of interface pt-1/0/0 and I Was able to get the OID (1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5.539) and pull it into our Zabbix 6 instance and its monitoring it just fine. 
 But I am HARD stuck at finding the MIB / OID corresponding to the value 79999 so I can also track the Download speed. I can not seem to find it anywhere. If I run an SNMP walk for that value it turns up nothing. I feel like im missing something and im now at bash head against wall territory so if I could get ANY advice that would be great.

At my work, I typically search for any networking terms or concepts that I am not aware of and most of the time, I come across the website Network Lessons. Material is good and informative. Is it worth the subscription or $390/Year? I already have INE subscription which I use for video courses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow, Datadog's sales are getting aggressive. Anyone else experiencing this?
 I keep getting calls from Datadog on my personal phone. They must have scraped it from the web. It's pretty obvious I'm being targeted due to my title. Nobody else at my company is getting these calls. I never requested any info from them either.
 I've already told them we use a different stack and aren't interested in changing. Datadog is WAY too expensive for us already and I've read enough billing issues and "getting bit by the dog" posts on this subreddit dealing with DD on top of that.
 I mentioned that there is one monitoring element I haven't found solution for (big mistake). I work in the robotics industry so I threw him a question about if they had solutions for ROS monitoring. He said no. Ok so I tell him I'm not interested and hang up.
 Two weeks later I get an email from the DD sales guy saying he discussed my needs with a developer and wanted to see if i was interested in what they came up with. They basically began trying to sell me on software that was hacked together after 2 weeks and wasn't even listed on their website. I'm good. No thanks.
 Months. no more calls. Ah peace.
 Today. The cycle has started again. Maybe a new guy. Idk. Told him I'm not interested. This time I keep my mouth shut about ROS.They obviously still don't offer it publically. He sent me a calendar invite anyway. He said if you can't make it or if you're not interested, just cancel. Fair enough.
 Ok, so I just cancelled that meeting. Now I'm getting emails about me cancelling and trying to reschedule. 
 I don't get it. I don't want your software. I already said no on the phone and email multiple times and cancelled your meetings. I have an option to reschedule too but, I didn't. Take a hint.
 Probably going to block them if this doesn't stop soon. I've never had to do this before in my career with any vendor.

I get along well enough with my manager and the sr admin on site. The Sr admin likes me but is already pushing for me to get brought on full time. I've gotten good feedback from them so I know that I'm doing something right.
 It doesn't feel right that the sr admin is already pushing for me to go full time after only a week. I don't even know what would come of this, the manager seems a little resistant to this but I imagine that's because it's only been a week. I can't tell if anything is wrong or not but I could use some sage advice. I think if I got it, it'd be a good opportunity for me to be a jr. I came from a background of Helpdesk / Desktop support with sysadmin duties mixed in so I have a lot of experience with what they do and I could use more.

 iperf3 -c 10.96.140.101 --udp -b 100m -bidir 
 If I remove "-bidir" it lost 0.5% 
 I believe it's correct behavior, it's verified new infrastructure, but I can't explain to myself why. 
 Any thoughts, why that happens?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that the solution is to get the framework updated for these ancient internally hosted sites and portals for them to be free of IE dependency. However, the answer is always "there's no budget for upgrades. Please continue to support". Access is becoming increasingly unreliable no matter how many IE Mode settings are tweaked on my end or the vendors end.
 External vendors are being given my contact information by procurement and purchasing departments and being told to contact me and I will fix it. I'm getting 2-3 requests a day from different people, knocking down my door screaming about how this needs to be fixed right this minute.
 I am not an applications person, the one applications manager we had left years ago. I am not sure how to approach this from a technical or professional perspective. I cant wave a magic wand and make incompatible technology suddenly work, but I also can't simply throw my hands up and say "Sorry, not my problem".

I wasn't aware that you could run a personal and work account side by side using the same email but the issue we're running into is when they're logged into the browser on their work account and attempt to open a SharePoint document in the desktop app it prompts for authentication so they'll type their email address and then get prompted to choose between the work or personal account. Once they select work, the account is signed in but the document is blank and eventually gives an error saying the document cannot be opened. 
 ​
 I've verified it's any document on SharePoint opened in desktop app, even if downloaded and then opened locally. We've removed the personal account from her machine (this particular user's is not domain joined unlike most), changed the primary alias on the personal account to a bogus email in hopes it wouldn't recognize it and removed the company email, turned off "auto sign in to microsoft apps" to revert them back to local account, reinstalled office, signed out of M365 on both accounts on browser and cleared cookies, tried various browsers and banged our heads against the wall for a long time. Has anyone ran into this issue? Does anyone know how to get out of it? Closing the personal account apparently can be done, it just requires contacting MS support which if I have to I will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks,
 After about a year of asking for our manager and dept head to give us an actual policy of what on-call entails and not just "work with the team to make sure any off-hours issues are resolved", we finally have it in writing, and it sucks. 
 We are expected to respond to all issues that come in 24 hours a day during the 7-day stretch we are on call. All issues have to be answered within the 0-2 hour SLA, including those reported by slack, jira ticket, email, and phone call. This is in addition to our normal 8 hour work day.
 The volume of calls generally isnt that bad (2-3 per day), but its the SLA bit thats chapping my rear a bit. To meet this expectation I'd have to set an alarm on my phone to wake up and check slack and Jira every 90 minutes or so. And on top of that we are to answer any helpdesk calls that come in regardless of time. 
 Aside from the question of legality in my state (I'm asking a friend who is a lawyer about that), I wanted to get the opinion of folks on here. Is this even remotely normal/acceptable?

 I have a peculiar situation at work where we once used exchange server 2003 back in 2009. And our primary DC was on windows server 2008. 
 Nowadays, we have our domain controler synchronized with azure every half an hour and we want to upgrade it from 2008 to 2019.
 So both our dc and azure are aware of the old 2003 exchange(now offline). Since our mails are on microsoft exchange atm, if we do the upgrade im afraid that something might go wrong since i dont know if both of them are aware 2003 is out of service.
 Is there any way to know for sure? Thnx

 I've worked here for just under a year, I'm 25 and started right after finishing school.
 First week I started I had an auditor call me since an IT-audit was due. Never heard of it, had to power through.
 The old IT guy left 6 months before I started. Had to train myself and get familiar with the infrastructure (bunch of old 2008 R2 servers). Started migrating our on-prem into a data center since the CEO wanted no business of having our own servers anymore.
 CEO called me after-hours on my private cellphone, had to take an old employees phone and use his number so people from work could call me. They never thought about giving me a work phone.
 At least I learned a lot and am free of stress. Have to sit here for the next 3 months though (termination period of 3 months).

 The requirement is to build a SQL environment using Windows Server Failover Clustering. This will be a two node SQL cluster (active/passive) running on across two virtual machines.
 My question is what licensing will be required. The company has SA, so from what I've read only the active node needs to be licensed. Just looking for some guidance on what I need to get the company to pay for. Would SQL Standard edition, and licensing for the cores on the virtual machine for the active node?
 Sorry for the simplistic questions, I'm new to SQL and I find microsoft licensing very confusing.
 Thanks for any assistance.

 Occasionally, we get issues that crop up. Sometimes it’s a SPF issue, sometimes a port issue on a device. Rarely is the issue a cable. 
 But I’d like to be able to independently and confidently be able to test a cable and rule that out when issues come up. 
 I know Fluke testers are the industry standard. But they have them ranging from a lot of money up to a ton of money. I don’t know what I need. 
 Can someone lay out the options and benefits/shortcomings of what I need for occasional troubleshooting? I don’t see this as on par with needs of an installer who has to certify multiple runs at once with cable serial number printouts. But testing here and there is more likely the use case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 It has recently occurred to me that part of job of IT and sysadmin is gaslighting users. Not intentionally. However over the years I have found that users will generally tell you a problem only for you to try it and it works. There have also been times where you make a change on the network, something you think won't be affected is affected and you undo that change. Instead of explaining the process of what you did (because either the user wont care or understand) you say, it's fixed. Or there have been instances when you kind of made a stupid mistake and instead of admit your mistake, you quietly undo the thing and the user is puzzled as to why it started working again. 
 I have been in IT for about 15 years in numerous roles and still carry a passion for it. I will passionately explain things to people if they will listen. For some reason though, I have found due to the environment and nature of IT, people either don't take interest or done care so you are sometimes left to look like you just performed magic and it is now working. 
 I am just wondering if anyone else feels the same.

 I'm no longer mad at Cisco I'm more philosophical about it. I can't be mad at a lamprey for being a lamprey, it's just in their nature to survive by providing very little and then continuing to take and take and take, forever. Cisco, sadly, is running hell's bell's to turn into that kind of company, right after Microsoft. Unlike Microsoft, though, Cisco is NOT a monopoly. Monopolies like Microsoft are government regulated and slapped down when they get too greedy. So, they don't do disgusting things like release HARDWARE products that stop functioning if you stop paying monthly subscription …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The company I work for has an Azure only environment. 
 We disable a user when an employee leaves the company (we never delete it), removing the license. 
 What we want is that an email goes out saying that the employee has left the company if someone tries to send the former employee an email. 
 I am trying to set up a catchall mail that sends that autoreply following these instructions (almost)
 https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30462.office365-catch-all-mailbox.aspx?fbclid=IwAR0DOO6wZRZvJaLRa5SHaaINP8a4BAzuDJ8AiGDlqXuarLVIFY9jrDpLrcs 
 I set up a distribution group (not dynamic) with an email address [disabledusers@contoso.com](mailto:disabledusers@contoso.com) , I also set up an shared mailbox employeehasleft[@contoso.com](mailto:userhasleft@contoso.com) with the OOO autoreply. 
 I set a task in our offboarding lifecycle workflow to add the user to the disableduser group. 
 I changed the accepted domain (in exchange - mailflow) to InternalRelay 
 I set up a mailflow rule 
 "Apply this rule if
 Is sent to a member of group 'disabledusers@contoso.com'
 Do the following
 Redirect the message to 'employeehasleft@contoso.com'" 
 But this thing is not working. 
 Is there no simple way to do this? I feel like I'm using "old" on prem solutions for my Azure only environment. 
 Thanks so much for your help guys

 Recently started a project to make sure Bios/Firmware updates on all of our Dells are up to date. I am using the ADMX files from DCU, in GP I have the settings as follows...
 "What to do when updates are found... Download and install updates."
 and for update settings I have tested multiple different settings and none of the have worked, originally I had it set on Automatic updates, but they wouldn't update. Then I set it for a specific time daily, I set it for 7PM last night on my test computer. Come in this morning and see it says it checked for updates last night at 7PM but the last time it updated was 3PM yesterday. So why will it not update automatically?

Many managers, including my own, hinting that it would be a shoe-in 
 3 days leave, came back and was off sick with gastric flu for 5 days.
 Found out yesterday that they filled the vacancy without telling me it had gone live or asking if I wanted to apply
 Questioned it with him, oh it’s a totally different role, no it’s what I’m actually doing right now!😡

 I've recently started moving all our users with admin rights to the Protected Users AD group.
 We've had no major fallout from this after an extensive testing period but one issue remains that I haven't been able to find anything about anywhere.
 We use a couple of Windows Server systems as print servers. We would like to manage them (print queues, permissions etc.) remotely using printmanagement.msc run from an elevated mmc.exe. When connecting to one of our print servers (Windows Server 2019 systems), the account is immediately locked out.
 I can see no unusual events when this happens (4769 [requesting kerberos service ticket], 304 [granting kerberos service ticket to a "Protected Users" member] and ultimately 4740 [account locked out]) and can't think of a reason why this would happen.
 Have any of you seen this before? I'd be grateful for any imput!

 ​
 I have a 3750 connected to a 9300 and it's capping out at ~300mbps, with inconsistent speeds overall on iPerf.
 ​
 There are not policies on either switch. Both endpoint ports are on the same vlan and communication works fine, just the bandwidth is poor.
 ​
 I have updated both the 9300 and 3750 to the latest ios yet this hasn't fixed it.
 ​
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas what it could be? (I cannot get rid of the 9300 at the moment)

 What I also noticed that if a Service Instance is inside a port-channel or a bundle-ethernet they suddenly can be monitored, is this correct?
 So, correct me if I'm wrong, if I REALLY wanted to monitor those service instances I can configure a port-channel with only 1 physical interface and I could get it working?
 FYI all of this is on a few ASR920 Cisco routers.
 How dumb is this? Is there a better way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've got a real head-scratcher here. We have a user called Tim (not his real name) who's calendar seems to be causing some major problems for other user's Outlooks clients. When the other users have Tim's calendar added to their list of shared calendars, their Outlook grinds to a halt and uses 40% of the CPU and causes total system instability. Every 5 seconds or so, it says "updating Tim's calendar" in the bottom right before disappearing again. This continues constantly as it was affecting one user for over a week until they reported it.
 The only way to fix this is to remove Tim's calendar from their Outlook completely - simply unchecking the box to display it doesn't work.
 The weird part is not everybody who has Tim's calendar has this issue, it seems to be 3 users out of about 10 who need access to his calendar. But all users who have this issue have Tim's calendar in their Outlook, so I'm fairly certain the issue is actually to do with Tim's calendar rather than the user's outlook clients..
 So far I have tried; • Quick and full repairs of Office on both the user's and Tim's devices • New Outlook profiles for both Tim and affected users • Removing all offline and cached items from Tim's Outlook calendar • Checking Tim's calendar for any recurring meeting going for excessive lengths of time
 I'm honestly a bit lost as to what to try next so any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been on some networking assignments lately that could really benefit from the ability to detect what IP settings a particular switch is using. We have one netool.io at work, but it's still in the grasp of another coworker. I'm wondering if I can potentially get the same performance from various Linux/Windows applications as I could from a netool.io. 
 Basically, I would just like to be able to plug into a switch cold and figure out what net address/subnet/vlans/etc. are currently configured. nmap and netstat are useful, but I haven't been able to reliably log into a switch in a timely manner yet. 
 I'll be heading back to Google shortly, but are there any online sources that explain specifically what netool.io and PockEthernet do? As I previously stated, it'd be really nice if I could just equip my laptop (or, ideally, my Samsung phone) with the tools necessary to perform the same function. 
 Any other ideas/reading/etc. for performing these sorts of tasks are also appreciated. 
 Thanks!

 15 x P40 disks were allocated to this VM - With read-caching
 A storage pool was created using these disks to create one 30TB drive for SQL data files. (There is a separate pool for SQL log files)
 Now, the column size for the data file storage pool was created as 3.
 What does this actually mean? How does this affect performance?

 there's a problem in our company with Microsoft Teams, especially with the chat feature.
 I think that Teams is a wonderful tool to use and can help us to boost our productivity at work. Unfortunately, some stupid colleagues use it to chat to each other, also creating groups. Now that the HR noticed it, they want me, as the IT admin, to disable the chat for everyone.
 I think that this approach is not the right one, firstly because there are a lot of people using the chat in the right manner, and secondly because a tool like Teams doesn't make sense without a chat, for me.
 Now the question. Is there the possibility to restrict in some way the ability to create groups for some people or to talk to each other? I really can't disable the chat for everyone, otherwise our dinosaurs colleague will continue to use the email as the tool to chat, send files, etc.
 Thanks!

 I have always used Exchange at previous jobs so far, but at my new employer Kerio Connect 9.4.2 is in use. And I am still trying to get used to it. Now I have 2 questions: 
 1.When setting up a mail account, we do document the default password assigned to each account in the process, but many users change it later. The problem: if a user falls ill, we would like to add an absence note for his mails. The easiest way to do this would be directly in the user account, but to log in there I would need his password. Is there a way to set up an out of office notification in the dashboard with the admin account as well ? 
 2.Sometimes it is also desired that another user simply takes care of the account of the sick user temporarily. The easiest solution would probably be to simply give the user the sick user's credentials...if we know them. Well, in Exchange it was comparatively simple: You simply gave the substitute access rights to the mailbox of the sick user and could then set up his account in Outlook, even without knowing his password. With Kerio I haven't found such a possibility yet. Is there such a possibility to give another user access to a mailbox ?

And there is a VPS with pfSense without a LAN network - only WAN. I need to combine office networks via IPsec so that they can see each other, but with a centralized connection via VPS with pfSense (this is a prerequisite). The problem is that the old Zyxel routers do not support either Routed IPsec or OpenVPN, so you need to use only IPsec.
 I don't understand how to configure IPsec on pfSense VPS without a LAN network, and what Phase2 policies to prescribe so that office networks can see each other.

 Looking to potentially implement some more effective phishing/email attack testing against my end users.
 I'm just wondering what people are using these days.
 The main things I am looking for is that the templates are actually good, more resembling spear phishing then your general blanket generic phish, or easily converted to resemble them. Things like if it were to masqueared as a onedrive shared file it looks legit. The ability to replicate things like O365 MiTM attacks and more complex attacks would be great.
 I trust pretty much all my users to spot the obvious low effort phish, but recently due to how public the business is we get a lot spear phishing. We stop 99% of them but have had a few incidents where people have clicked through onto them, and frankly for the ones that have gotten through the various filtering I don't blame them. They were good phish emails, branded up, using peoples names, and coming from legit domains it looks like our business would have dealings with leading to legit looking phish pages.

I'm hoping there might be someone here that better understands Aruba's wireless solution to help me make a bit of progress.
 I've ran into an issue where with our branch locations, even though traffic can traverse between the controller and the AP, it can't establish a IKEv2 tunnel. Due to this it continuously has the AP reboot. Related, it seems that the tunnels continuously renegotiating eventually overloads the VM and causes it to drop. Both of these issues seem to be resolved with disabling CPSec. (Which the TAC recommended as a remedy)

It's a full key man dependency with all the admin accounts etc sitting with me. I've argued against this for a long time but the business doesn't "have the resource" to hire a second or train an existing person to be the second.
 Now for the processes, that's all documented and ready to be given/read, however what do I do about admin accounts? For some products we have specific admin accounts, but I'm unable to give passwords/access because the person who is replacing me hasn't been hired yet, so doesn't have an email address I can give those details to. 
 For some products, we don't have specific admin accounts as its licence based (tight company) and the admin just resides with me. I could make someone else in the team an admin but they won't have the foggiest what to do with it and when the new IT bod comes along they wont have a clue how to transfer admin rights.
 What am I meant to do in this situation? How can I best facilitate an actual handover of administrative rights and privileges

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I am working towards an FSRM solution that triggers an email alert and action when a blacklisted ext is uploaded on all of our File Servers. I tried a whitelist approach but this will not work in our environment.I am pulling the blacklist from the famous https://fsrm.experiant.ca/.
 ​
 I have been back and fourth with our infosec team and my own research on what is the best course of action if a user does upload a blacklisted file type. Most people online say to do an SMB denial, some want to do a network kill switch, and some want to lock/disable the user account.
 ​
 The Infosec team did agree with my research after I suggested an SMB denial and disabling the AD account but after further research I feel this may not be the best solution. Reference here:https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6pq2uv/help\_with\_fsrm\_command\_to\_disable\_ad\_account/After I sent this new information, they decided to advise that we utilize Sentinel One's logging and then it can escalate from within S1 and then we can kill the network from the console or re-enable.
 ​
 What do other Sysadmins do for this?

 Here's a brief overview of our deployment plan:
 Scope: Total 4 sites (1 HQ and 3 remote)
 DNAC Cluster: We will have a DNAC cluster with three nodes located at our headquarters, ensuring high availability and redundancy.
 WLCs and PSNs: Each site will have two Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and two Policy Services Nodes (PSNs) to handle wireless connectivity and authentication.
 ISE PAN and MNT: At our headquarters, we plan to host ISE Primary Administration Node (PAN) and Monitoring (MNT) nodes for centralized management and monitoring.
 Integration with DNAC: We're integrating the PAN node with DNAC using PxGrid to leverage the capabilities of both platforms.
 Site Details:
 Each site consists of Catalyst 50+ switches, 300+ Catalyst Wi-Fi 6 WAPs, and 2000+ users.
 HQ and Remote Sites are connected over the Site-to-Site (VPN.
 We are working with a partner who will assist us with the design and deployment, but I firmly believe in the power of community knowledge. I know that the insights and experiences shared by professionals like you can significantly contribute to the success of our project.
 Additionally, we are considering deploying SD-Access, do you recommend its implementation in our deployment.
 So, I kindly request your suggestions, tips, and best practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I just installed an IDF in an outbuilding. I installed a switch with a single Aruba AP. The AP comes up on the controller and even claims to have 5 clients with assigned IP addresses--2 of which are this laptop and my iPhone--, but none of them work.
 So rather than dumping my whole env on you guys, can you teach me how to fish? It looks like the traffic is blocked somewhere, as if the VLANs were aligned from point A to point B, i.e. AP to access switch to core switch to router.
 Current config:
  
MDF Core Switch: I have the Wifi VLAN 92 Untagged Tagged on the trunk port to the IDF (#51).
 IDF Access Switch: I have the Wifi VLAN 92 Tagged Untagged on ports 17-20 (with WAP in port 19) and Untagged Tagged on the trunk port #28 (SFP).
  
Context:
  
Here's a network diagram and a sample of my VLAN config on the Core Switch.
 Core switch is TP-Link T1600-52PS.
 Access switch is the smaller 24-port version: TP-Link TL-SG2428P(new generation has diff model numbers, this used to be the T1600-28PS)
 VLAN 86 is Mgmt, 92 is Wifi, 99 is wall jacks (I didn't pick 'em: hold your applause)
  
Update 9:54 PM ET: I had the Tagged and Untagged labels backwards. Sorry for the confusion. Obviously, I don’t know what I’m doing.

I wear so many hats here at this company sometimes this leads to some of systems being a set it and forget it so it’s hard to be razor sharp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sure there is a reason for why we need RD and RTs separately. Reading up only gave vague distinctions but I haven't got a convincing answer why on a real deployment, we would want RD and RTs , 2 different entities, to distinguish routes. Is my understanding correct here:
 Say, you have 2 tenants, say Coke and Pespi, each with say, a number of departments (accounting, sales, etc) connected to a DC. You would have separate RD for each tenant on the router there at the DC. (Route-leaking from Pepsi to Coke is a different concept that theoretically would only need RDs ?). 
 Coming back to question, we would want export and import RT configured, because, say one satellite office of Pepsi only has a sales dept (with import RT B) and wouldn't routes from accounting dept (RT A), hence, RD: Distinguish a tenant, RT: export/import: Only import routes from a particular 'group' of routes even from the same tenant. Does this sound correct?

So is the subscription measured on the OLT port so say you have an XGSPON (10 gig port) and you spilt 1/64 do you sell each customer like say 300 meg and say that's oversubscription rate of 100 present ? What is a typical over subscription rate? Is that bandwidth to each subscriber limited by the how may time you split or is configured on the port?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the company I work for was bought out, all the great stuff happened, benefits cost more, no raise, no real good news for normal techs and all. We usually work on call in a rotation, work from home that week, and we are able to monitor everything and work for OT pay. Now its being rumored that they will not pay OT rates, still want us to work afterhours/on call, but their fix is to let us leave early, which is just offensive. Is this a standard across the board? Is this legal? When my rotation comes up, if I am asked this I don't think I can comply honestly, because it does not feel worthwhile to have my whole week sidelined, and potentially working afterhours (usually i hit a few calls but probably around 3-5 hours extra during my rotation) at my base pay, just wanted some kind support or some kind of resource or baseline so I know what I am potentially going to be walking into. Thanks!

I'm planning to move one power supply to a new UPS battery backup. If I unplug one power supply, but the other power supply remains powered/unchanged, the switch and all its modules should stay completely online right? I only ask because in the past I had an issue with another brand chassis switch when I unplugged one of the two power supplies, several modules in the chassis powered off unexpectedly. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm super frustrated and don't know where to go next. On Thursday last week, we started having intermittent issues with our Comcast fiber service. As an example, we cannot get to finance.yahoo.com or secure.bankofamerica.com . HTTP/S , ping, trace route all fail. Some folks across the US cannot connect to the VPN (and some can). I put in a ticket and they blame our firewall (Barracuda). So, I put in a ticket with Barracuda, and they say it's an ISP issue. We then plug a laptop directly into the fiber switch to bypass Barracuda, and still having Internet issues.
 Trace route always times out after hitting 96.110.117.181, which whois says is comcast routing.
 I then took our comcast cable connection going to our secondary network and plugged it into our firewall. I set it so that it would be the primary gateway instead of our fiber gateway. Traffic works just fine (it's just slower). When I do a traceroute through the cable gateway, it takes a different route and does not hit 96.110.117.181.
 Comcast support keeps telling me the problem is our equipment and don't want to seem to acknowledge the issue is their routing.
 Am I missing something here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 In our project we use PLC to control field devices with remote IO modules. This communication between PLC and remote IOs is handled by the PLC proprietary Ethernet protocol for SIL4 (safety integrity level).
 For troubleshooting reasons, we need to analyze the packets flowing between PLC and remote IOs so we set the port mirroring option in communication module of PLC. We can see other protocol packets with their respective IO IPs (i.e NTP) or ping packets. However, we can not capture the application data packets (UDP) with Wireshark. We tried port mirroring from both COM module and managed switch (to eliminate COM module mirroring feature bug) but no chance. Neither setup could capture data packets. Managed switch we used is Ruggedcom.
 Is there any restriction/limitation in port mirroring to not mirror the proprietary protocols or something? Are there anyone used this feature in industrial Ethernet environment?

 My manager is an actual workaholic who quoted that this morning. I am pushover so I just nodded, and also because he has 20 more years of experience, and is an authority at this job. He makes ridiculous amounts of money, and seems like his focus has always been to advance himself, make tons of money, (which is nice when you're not coming off as an selfish prick telling folks to miss important family events). He also works late nights, and seems like is happy to do so. How do you even deal with these type of people? How do you even support these environments? His boss seems to be fine that he is still doing late night events after so many years, and it's funny to me that for all the work they put in, not once on how to actually build out a team and delegate properly. ugh.
 Edit- I also want to add, that I also do late night maintenances, but I couldn’t make a maintenance event few weeks ago due to family gathering which they were aware about. Manager was upset that I couldn’t make the event hence the post

 I work in pro-av but I'm also our resident network engineer. I purchased a Fluke MS2-KIT back in 2012. It's been great, but right now I am needing to replace several of the remote IDs and the #1 cap. 
 I know this means I need the MS2-IDK27 set and the MS2-WM. Both of these are very expensive replacements considering the cost I paid for the kit back in the day. I realize the same kit is almost double the cost now.
 I am considering moving to the LinkIQ kit, but I am wondering if there are better or more economical options that may or may not be Fluke. 
 I am obviously not going to put the money out for a DTX or full certification kit as this is a personal purchase. 
 What are you all using?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've heard time and time again that the best-practice for monitoring tools is to only ever be alerted on things that require action from an actual person. 
 I agree with that philosophy, it makes crystal clear sense. Here's the thing though: my workplace does not abide by that whatsoever, and it is intentional. 
 I've been trying and failing to clean up our SCOM environment since like March. 
 Every time I've approached my team and my boss about turning off an email alert that isn't actionable, I'm always met with "no, leave that on, I'd rather get the email than turn it off". 
 Every single person on my team receives hundreds of non-actionable alerts every single day. If you need information from a specific timeframe, you check your email alerts. Right clicking and 'mark all as read' is an every day occurrence. 
 Sending a message in Teams that says "you're about to get bombarded by emails from what I'm working on, just ignore them" is an every single day occurrence. 
 When we patch, we get thousands of email alerts that we have to sort through the following Monday every month. 
 I've tried telling my team that these alerts can be condensed into dashboards in SCOM where the information is just as accessible and your inbox stays clean. But they'd rather receive the emails. My boss is extremely clear on her stance that she'd rather get hundreds of non-actionable alerts per day and manually sort through them. 
 Do other places actually not do that? I'm putting a lot of effort into learning how SCOM works and how we can organize the data from SCOM to not rely on constant email spam. But my workplace wants the comstant email spam and has instructed me not to get rid of it. 
 Do you guys actually operate with the philosophy that emails should only be sent if an action is required?

I'm looking for more of a vendor agnostic fundamentals of network design and architecture.
 How many years experience would you say is required for this transition to take place?
 Because there is no Masters Degree is "Network Architecture" - what resources would you say give the best "education" in this pursuit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 First of all, thank you for your valuable input and time.
 I'm a rookie sysadmin working for a fairly small company, and I've recently been tasked with exploring database rack monitoring. As someone with no prior experience in this domain, the vast amount of information available can be quite overwhelming.
 Overall i'm looking for a not too expensive setup to monitor our racks with a motion sensor and camera. 
 We rent multiple racks in different data centers, and our manager wants us to monitor these racks 24/7. The monitoring system needs to operate effectively in various environmental conditions, such as cold/hot temperatures and low/high light sources. Ideally, we'd like a camera to activate and record video on one of the rack's servers when motion is detected. Additionally, we plan to dedicate a VM to manage the camera(s). Our requirements are relatively straightforward; we primarily need a camera to record any access to our equipment. 
 I've come across several recommendations from other sysadmins, with APC solutions being frequently mentioned. The NetBotz Camera Pod 165 appears to be a suitable camera option. However, I'm unsure if it can be used without a NetBotz rack monitor. I've also noticed suggestions for the Unifi camera solutions.
 Those solutions are extremely expensive for what we need to do. 
 ​
  
Would it be possible to simply use a webcam managed by the VM ? 
  
​
  
Are there good open-sourced project you experienced sysadmins are using for this particular use case scenarios ?
  
​
  
Which camera / webcams would be best suited for simply monitoring access to our racks? 
  
​
 I'm truly fresh out from school, we've done some image processing projects in python so maybe in the worse case I could improvise a cluncky script that launches everytime the VM boots up ?
 Apologies for the novice question, and I greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you can provide.
 Best regards,
 Ben

 Here is a screenshot of the issue from control panel: https://i.imgur.com/xajRxuv.png
 Basically GPO deployed printer is copy-pasted with the identical name many times (usually only 20 actual print queues) but now there are +200 duplicated entries. 
 What I have found out/know so far:
 - Issue seems to be limited to Xerox printers. The HP Printers seem to have no issue and are deployed the same way
 - The used printer driver is "Xerox Global Print Drivers PS" version 5733.1100.0.0 Typ 3
 - Medical environment. Many users per PC.
 - Afaik the issue is company-wide (50ish PCs). Not sure how wide though.
 - The device manager do NOT list the offending printer queue.
 - In Windows 10 menu -> Devices the printer is listed (several times) as "Driver not available".
 - If opened in the control panel -> printers you can not interact with it beyond 3 options: Remove device, troubleshoot device and (if I remember correctly from the client pc) properties.
 - Full Windows environment (Both client and servers).
 Tried searching the issue already and found out it seems to be a xerox-specific issue but don't really know where to start and still am kinda a rookie in many regards.
 Anyone had the same issue somewhere and know of a resource to fix it or to identify the problem better?

Just added 2 new printers, iR-ADV C359, and when we switch to PaperCut the control panel just goes to a white screen and won't load the app. We can still access the local menus such as 123.We have upgraded the server to the latest version (22.[something]) and also deployed the updated .jar file. 
 The server reports the printers are at 1.3.0.This seems to be a bigger issue than just my 2 new printers, anyone having this problem, and any workarounds?
 So far our vendor hasn't been much help.
 ETA: vendor assures us that the printers are supported and that the reason they aren't on the supported list is because they are too new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the UK, if it matters (240V).
 We have a new Eaton UPS that should be hardwired (9PX with extended battery module) Our server room has two 16A supplies, presented as "commando" female sockets (2P+E, IEC 60309).
 The user manual states a cable cross section of 4-16mm2 or 12-6 AWG, which seems oversized. It's possible to get up to 10mm2 as a flexible 3-core cable, but is it right? One end is terminated directly into the terminal block of the UPS, and I was hoping to have the other wired into a 16A commando plug so I can plug it in to the socket.
 (The electrician will be making the connections at each end, but have requested we source the cable and plug).
 I'm happy to source the 10mm2 cross section cable if it sounds right and would fit in a 16a connector. Length is a few metres between UPS and socket so cost is not an issue.

 We've been using Veeam for a couple of years (on-prem backup server), and IMHO it's been working quite well.
 But one of my co-workers is sceptical to the whole concept of having all our files, e-mails, etc stored on an on-prem server - in case it gets compromised, then we have a huge problem. So he does have a valid point, even if we have done everything possible to avoid this (separate network, server is only accessible indirectly, etc). 
 So currently, we're running the backups manually (boot server, run backup, shut down server again) once a month or so.
 Now that our Veeam licenses are about to expire, we are considering not renewing the licenses and live without backups and rather rely on the various safety features in MS365.
 What would you guys do?

 I'm no sysadmin, currently more of a very low level support. Think google workspace administration, sitting down with a coworker if they switch from Win to Mac to explain some basics for example, and the omnipresent "why is the printer not working", that sort of think ...
 My question for you guys is - where to read about a "proper" business IT setup? By that I mean how things should run in a professional setting, compared to private users. I know local accounts are not the way to go, nor is setting up 20 devices in a row manually, or purchasing one MS Office license at a time, running MDM ... but where can I learn about the correct procedures?
 This place can get confusing. I can read and try to understand what ADDS is, or GPO, PDQ inventory, FOG deployment, and a bunch of other terms, but it doesn't help much for the overall picture
 If you got a moment to help out, thank you.

 I am a IT tech working on becoming a sysadmin myself. A step in this plan is solving an issue with outlook. 
 My company uses Salesforce to collect and synchronize email signatures on outlook.
 Ever since we started deploying windows 11, We have been facing a comfort issue for a lot of users. 
 The issue is the salesforce signatures synchronize on outlook and appear under signatures on this device. Though the signatures appear here we are unable to select them in the choose default signature block. 
 We are using outlook version 2304 on window 11 22H2. 
 If anyone has any lead for a solution I will be forever grateful.

 This isn't very actionable as it requires us to manually harass end-users into improving their passwords/password re-use, only for them to make the same mistakes a few weeks later and show up on the report again. 
 Can anything be done, at the very minimum, to automate nagging users to have a better score?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around the end of April, some of the mailbox rules in Outlook stopped automatically moving messages to their appropriate folders in my inbox. These rules have worked unchanged for years. I've tried recreating, enabling/disabling, deleting Outlook program files associated with mailbox rules but nothing in my googling or help from Microsoft has resolved my issue yet. Microsoft 365 support is still investigating.
 A couple weeks ago I noticed an Exchange Online transport rule not working as it has in the past. It looks at sender domain, if the sender if outside the org, and dmarc=pass, dmarc=bestguesspass in the header of messages to determine if the message should bypass spam filtering. Now it appears it won't bypass spam filtering if the message is sent to more than one recipient, even if the rule is a match. I find this strange since the rule doesn't check recipient information at all.
 Anyone else experiencing any shenanigans with Outlook rules or Exchange Online transport rules?

She noticed that after connecting via rdp, the resolution on the desktop PC changes, but when she changes it back to the previous setting, the image is still off and there are some parts that are completely cut off like the taskbar. Turns out opening up the intel graphics control panel and changing the setting to "Adjust to screen" (or something like that iirc) fixed it. 
 Is there any way to prevent RDP from messing with these settings? If not, at least some way to automatically change them back when the computer starts up again.

 Sometimes, you luck out and stumble across an extremely simplified solution to what seems to be a complex task, and it absolutely rocks your world with how easy the task just became.
 Many times, these solutions are considered "common knowledge", and you scratch your head whenever someone around you has their mind blown.
 The thing is, what you may think of as common knowledge is something that someone else in the same role as you has never heard of. Yet.
 If you're like me, you've failed up into your current SysAdmin-ish role by pure random happenstance, tenacity, failing better (meaning that you fail, learn, and move on to the next more complex failure, learning again, and moving on... you get my drift), and turning a hobby into a career. You drink from a firehose your entire professional life and earn your scars through pure experience, frustration, and one or two nervous breakdowns. I'd spare anyone that last experience if I could.
 Drop your wisdom in here so that others may benefit. It doesn't matter how simple you think it is. If it's something that changed how you perform a task, or it redefined a process, please share.

 I'm currently facing an issue with VMware Horizon 8 and instant-clone image publishing, and I could really use some assistance. Whenever I try to publish my instant-clone image, I encounter the following error message in Horizon:
 "Publish Error:
 Fault type is AGENT_CUSTOMIZATION_FAULT - Internal template vm-542704 customization failed. Error description not set by agent."
 I've already attempted a couple of troubleshooting steps, but unfortunately, the problem persists. Here's what I've tried so far:
 Removing AV software: I thought that the AV might be interfering with the publishing process, so I temporarily uninstalled it from the system. However, this didn't resolve the issue. See here; https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90781 
 Using sysprep instead of clone: In an attempt to overcome the customization failure, I switched from using the clone method to sysprep. Despite this change, the error message still pops up.
 I'm now at a loss for what to do next. Have any of you encountered a similar error while publishing instant-clone images in VMware Horizon 8? If so, I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have to help me resolve this problem.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

 I have to configure OSPF neighbouship between my MLS (multilayer switch) and my VPN concentrator for redundancy reasons.
 The issue is that the VPN concentrator's public IP address is in the subnet of a secondary IP address of the MLS as illustrated in the following diagram :
 https://prnt.sc/DhSexwCBLcdz
 From what I know, OSPF only sends hello packets from the primary IP address. Meaning that even if I declare the 10.10.20.0 network in OSPF and make the interface active, VPN won't receive any OSPF hello packet.
 What is the best way in that situation to form a neighbourship between these two devices?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We occasionally have a development update file that we need to give customers to fix issues with the software we provide.
 I've been looking at the options of sharing from the OD, but I'm not keen on the Dev sharing a file direct from the OD via email. (He is under a business use case and special group to allow him to do it btw) Ideally I want no connection from user to Dev OneDrive.
  
 It seems the best option I can find is to have some kind of sharing site he is allowed to upload the file to, then the customers gets an email with a time limited download.
  
 So questions.
  
1) Does anyone know secure sites that would fit the bill?
 2) Is there a way to build something like a simple download site in AWS? We could put up something in AWS if needed. (Not my area but we have some knowledge)
 3) Does anyone have any links that they could point me too for what's need to make that in AWS?
 4) Or any other suggestions

 ​
 my hoster told me that he will end his service till the end of the month. I am running quite critical things on this service. I am able to get by backups in a .img.gpg format by the hoster. Now I need a VPS-Service where I can upload the last backup in this format to move without long downtime.
 My current setup is
 4GB RAM
 2vCores
 200GB storage
 100 Mbit up/down
 Located in Germany
 ​
 I could take some more RAM, storage and vCores. But it is not necessary.
 Are there any (pricey) services that are capable of this setup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve posted a few times and I’ve seen many others bring up that a lot of us may be misclassified as exempt when you should be non exempt. 
 The DOL has information that in my reading would be hard to argue that any IT position is non exempt, falling under the professional exemption. You need college/training to support IT systems and as long as you’re paid the minimum - how would you argue a position is non exempt otherwise?
 https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17a-overtime
 I tried searching this sub (I didn’t look very hard or long) and didn’t find any posts of people saying they were able to fight their exempt status.
 Have you seen or heard of anyone fighting their exempt status?
 Edit: Here’s an example of someone winning but their job was more helpdesk, not sysadmin https://www.dkattorneys.com/publications/personnel-exempt-flsa-overtime-requirement/ We as sysadmins have some say in the design of IT systems.

I want to avoid opening up the entire 49152-65535 range to all my end user devices so that they can just enroll in a radius WiFi certificate.

 He reaches out to our ISP to schedule a call to discuss a new location and instead of coordinating it for a time I’m scheduled to work, he schedules for a day I’m not working, acknowledges I’m not working in the email and another team mate (who knows nothing about our network) can join. 
 Later, he asks me in person to join if I can. I thought about it but I didn’t even get the meeting invite and no, It’s not urgent, It’s my day off. Waiting two days to have the call wouldn’t cause any problems. 
 I think he’s expecting me to work more than my 40 at this point on a regular basis. I don’t and I will fight to not to or be compensated with additional time off. We’ve already been short 2.5 people for almost a year and I’m behind on everything - I’m at the point where only the squeaky wheels are getting grease - 95% of my time is spent on helpdesk and I’m even falling behind on helpdesk tickets.
 I was looking for a new job but stopped to see how the new boss would work out and if he could get us back on track. Concerned, I might need to start looking again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advice here. So I am a younger guy currently working in helpdesk trying to move to a full sysadmin role. At my company, Head of IT has always encouraged me to grow. In my performance review last year, he said he wanted me in a sysadmin role by Fall of this year. My company offers a bonus/certification program that pays for and gives bonuses for passing certain exams. So I have been taking advantage of this program and getting the certs as others have done. Others have gotten these certs and no one has ever batted an eye about it. In the past 2 months, I have been doing a lot of studying and got 4 certs on our in our certification program. On the last 3, my boss has been really slow to respond about them and follow up with HR/Finance so I get the bonus. Now, after my last cert I got, he emailed me back quickly saying to stop getting certs for now and he needs to talk to the CTO about it. Someone on my team got the exact same certs and they were praised for it, but when I do I am told to stop? I am just trying to grow into the role that I want at this company and I am confused as to why he wants me to stop my growth. I mean I understand if he doesn't want people taking advantage of the bonuses and then leaving, but I have been with this company the entirety of my career in IT (I am young so not that many years). 
 I understand I am in a unique situation and I don't know if other companies offer things like this. Any advice? Am I overthinking? Should I ask him about it? All feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading.
 Edit: I don’t believe that it is budget or cost related. There have been other people in the past who have gotten certifications that grant bonuses that are double mine, and they were encouraged to keep going. I am leaning more that it is him wanting to protect the company and from people getting a bunch and then leaving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Work for smaller ISP that has recently started doing more B2B service. We’ve been whitelisting the few public IPs for port forwards to our ordering and provisioning systems and creating the tenant/admin account and allow those businesses/admins to complete all their own onboarding for their users. This is quickly becoming not scalable though. We are planning on setting up an SSL Web VPN page on a Fortigate with bookmarks to the individual services they need to access but trying to find a solution for the Fortigate VPN accounts. 
 Ideally we would create the single new admin account for the business and then allow them to create all their own users as they hire/fire. Trying to figure out the best solution for a Radius/LDAP server for the Fortigate to use for authentication that we can configure each tenant on and allow them to build/remove users without seeing the other tenants obviously. I tried to look at FreeIPA and it’s use of realms but that doesn’t seem to work as I expected it would. 
 Our current internal Radius server is just TACACS fed by a MySQL backend which is fine for us to run SQL query’s for the couple of user changes we have per year but that’s obviously not ideal for this B2B use case. 
 Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Microsoft released a patch to fix a Secure Boot bypass bug used by the BlackLotus bootkit we reported on in March. The original vulnerability, CVE-2022-21894, was patched in January, but the new patch for CVE-2023-24932 addresses another actively exploited workaround for systems running Windows 10 and 11 and Windows Server versions going back to Windows Server 2008.
 The BlackLotus bootkit is the first-known real-world malware that can bypass Secure Boot protections, allowing for the execution of malicious code before your PC begins loading Windows and its many security protections. Secure Boot has been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet the software's system requirements.
 An attacker who successfully deployed BlackLotus on a targeted system could obtain complete control over the OS boot process—giving them “almost the same capabilities as firmware implants, but without having to overcome the multilevel SPI flash defenses…or the protections provided by hardware (like Intel Boot Guard),”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I seem to have a bad habit of jumping from the frying pan into the fire when accepting new roles these last few years. Examples are:
 ​
  
Roles listed as fully remote and put as fully remote in the contract, and then told two months in I need to relocate immediately or be fired
 Multiple managers fighting over what tasks I should be assigned and asking me to convince my managers to allow me to work on things or be dismissed (why did you hire me then?)
 Asked to frequently travel and told I will not be reimbursed
 Onboarding consisting of being given an employee ID and the phone number for the help desk; team leads too busy to do onboarding but will ask for status on projects I don't even know about, etc
  
What kind of questions can someone ask during the interviews to try and suss out these kind of crazy situations? I understand this is a time of complete chaos for a lot of companies and onboarding in our field is always a bit sink or swim, but this is well beyond what I'm used to. One question I'm planning to ask next time is "can you describe your onboarding process?" and "who will I report to? Are there multiple individuals I am expected to report to? If so, what strategies do you have to ensure alignment between their priorities?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm in the middle of migrating our current WAN facing firewalls (ASA and Firepower) to Palo Alto 3320's. With Firepower, the concept of "trying" (because, Firepower) to block a URL is a case of putting the URL on the rule, then block/allow depending. At the moment, I've mimicked the Firepower structure, in the sense that I've created the URL Category entries and applied them to the Security Rules. Apologies for not having this completely accurate, but I did a POC last with Palo Alto and I remember that it wasn't as straightforward as building out the rules like I have currently. There where "dependencies" and other categories involved in order for it to work. I've forgot exactly how I went about perfecting it in the end. I think I had the URL rules setup like I do currently, but I had a catch all for low risk categories etc... at the bottom, so the rest of the webpage URL's can be downloaded to.
 I know the rule setup in Palo Alto isn't as straightforward or "obvious" as say, Firepower, I know Firepower sucks overall, but I need to wrap my head around the best way to structure rules for the Palo again.

 Here's an example. I have been tasked with setting up a new server. Currently, a large amount of employees use software that relies on a server. We're planning on replacing the server. I was wanting to use DNS to point to the new server using the old server's name to avoid having to reconfigure a large number of computers and applications.
 My coworkers don't like the idea. They would like to update all the computers and applications instead. I'm concerned about missing some computers and having upset employees.
 In addition, I proposed that we could update all the applications with a new name for the server, but use something more generic than the servers name so that when we do this next time, we won't have this problem. My coworkers didn't like that either.
 Am I wrong? Do I need to rethink my strategies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I installed EVE-NG after having massive issues getting Cisco FTDv and FMCv running in GNS3. I managed to get both VMs up and running, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to get connectivity between the two devices. 
 One issue is that when I built a "network", and drag connections to the FTD/FMC, it does not provide me any options to declare "which" interface I want to connect to. If I could do that, it would not matter which network I built between them, it should work. I don't need internet access from the VMs, I just want them to talk to each other. 
 Now, this is not that big of an issue on the FMC, as there only seems to be one interface connected, and I have put it on the same network as the FTDv. 
 But I think the core issue is.. From the look of the interfaces, both devices are using loopbacks as the interface connected to switch in EVE-NG. I don't want to change the IPs on those interfaces, for fear that I lose the ability to console into the devices, which is currently working through the EVE-NG web console.
 ​
 On both FMCv and FTDv, both eth0 interfaces are configured for the desired management network. But the Transmit/Receive statistics on these interface show they are not connected in EVE-NG. So, given I don't seem to have the ability to specify which interfaces on the VM I want to use, how on earth do I connect the two eth0 interfaces in EVE-NG?

The more I research them, the more I am convinced that they are really just like big (e.g., Tier 1 AS) internet service provider (ISP) networks. Cloud service providers (CSPs) face the same challenges and appear to use fundamentally similar technologies, except that they might be more "agile" in adopting new tech such as the latest flavor of SDN. Both do traffic estimation, traffic engineering, many CSPs also use MPLS tunnels like many ISPs, etc.
 Thus, my question: What are differentiating factors between a CSP WAN (think Azure's OneWAN) and a large ISP network?

 My motorcycle is a bmw adventure bike, it's quiet and polite. It's very very far from some loud nasty Harley or dousche sport bike. I have Kevlar "chinos" and plain black protective mid tops(think converse is but just all black with a tan sole). I can leave my jacket in a luggage case on the bike too. 
 So I should pretty much look the normal part when I'm interfacing with them, I'm just curious if they saw or it came up if it might come off poorly or reflect against my company. 
 I'm probably over thinking this and I'm sure it's fine, I just would like to hear other people's thoughts. The big motivation I have for this is two fold: I get milage reimbursed and my bike gets like 60mpg VS my explorer getting 18-20mpg, so I'll make out good on it. Secondly, I just like to ride and every mile on the bike is a good one.

 I was able to setup and deploy a Mac Pro from ABM and assign it a profile in Azure. Setup went smooth and it pulled down all the required apps and management profile. One of the required apps is our company portal.
 When I open up Company Portal it tells me it hasnt been set up for corporate use yet and to begin setup. It then wants to download and install the same management profile that was installed during automatic enrollment so it fails and I can't use company portal.
 When I check azure it shows the device has been enrolled and is compliant so I'm at a loss how to bypass this check by company portal. I even tried to go and assign it through portal.manage.microsoft.com and that didn't help.

 If you work on a team that rotates weekend shifts, do you get the following Monday off? We only have a couple weekend shift per quarter and all generally work 9-5 mon-fri.I'm working my first weekend shift and realizing they expected me to come in Monday.
 That's 12 days in a row unless I use my personal PTO(which i did for monday). That's not illegal it just seems insane and it is literally the legal limit in Cali. I've worked drive troughs, shitty retail, waited tables, gone from help desk to sysad in one org working very hard... I've been in the Army Infantry...
 Other than deployment and 1 BIG exercise per year for training, I don't think I've ever been expected to work 12 days in a row. Is this normal? I know tons of orgs rotate weekend shift, just curious if you get comped on the back end or not.

 If you had to transfer, say, 1 PetaByte from your office in San Francisco to another office in New York, how would you go about doing it?
 My guess is there are 2 ways:
  
use rsync to transfer over the internet.
 
clone the data onto a HDD, and fly it across to New York.
 
 The first solution is cheaper (depending on your ISP) but may require plenty of time, weeks and even months (correct me if I'm wrong).
 The second solution might be quicker but slightly expensive.
 I'm wondering if anyone here has some experience with this?

 Scrub admin here. I'm having issues with getting kerberos auth to work with a Postgres RDS instance. Followed official AWS guides on how to enable it. Enabled Password and Kerb auth on the instance, linked it to a managed AWS DC, created users on the db ([user@bone.dog.woof](mailto:user@bone.dog.woof)), and added them to the rds_ad group (user I'm trying to log in as exists on the DC as well). I then threw in the krb5.ini file under C:\Windows that points to the domain/realm. Issue is when I try to connect with domain creds via pgadmin with kerby enabled, I get a SSPI context error. Using dBeaver, it's KDC_Err_Client_Revoked.
 Using Windows to accomplish this not Linux if that's important to know.
 Anyone have experience with this before and know what I'm missing?

 We have a user that works remotely sometimes as well at the office, and some of the time when connecting through RDP the machine rejects the password when connecting remotely. When this happens, we try connecting the user locally and it works fine, try again remotely and it fails. 
 The odd this is sometimes when this happens, when we try a different machine/location sometimes it will work sometimes not. But if we reboot the machine it seems to work fine
 As far as I can tell from Event Viewer there does not seem to be any errors generated when this happens unless there is some other logging that I need to turn on.
 These are both Windows 10 machines and all updates are done, and outside of the common check username and password are valid I am not finding anything specific to this.
 Any thoughts?

 In a small setup (3x VM servers and 1x SAN), why not do this? The switch can handle different MTU/Jumbo Frames per port, VLANs etc (so all storage networks can be on their own VLANs). In the virtual chassis setup it means no chance of config differences between switches. Controller A of the SAN could go to Switch 1, and Controller B of the SAN could go to Switch 2, so full redundancy.
 The VM servers would have 4x ports per server - 2x of which would be for VM traffic and their associated VLANs, and 2x would be for the SAN traffic. Again would go between switches, so a single switch failure would have no downtime.
 Can anyone give a good argument on this setup on why this shouldn't be done?

I started looking up practice questions, however, and noticed there's a lot of questions that were absolutely not covered by the study material I have. Are these older / no longer relevant questions or is my study material simply lacking? For example: What is the basic unit of framing in SDH and the bit rate for its transmission? I just did a ctrl+f on my study guide and there are only 3 spots that SDH is mentioned and none of them describe the bit rate.
 Obviously I can Google the answers but there's a LOT of questions on those online practice exams. I can already pass the provided practice exam. Actually I took the provided practice test before even reading the material and I passed, barely. I expect now that test would be easy. I'm just worried about questions not covered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got tons of certs. I've got experience working in a data center. I'm currently employed, meaning I have the basic soft skills needed to hold down a job. I get tons of interviews whenever I'm looking to advance my career, so I'm clearly a desirable candidate. But I never get past that first interview. Usually it's the standard "you'll hear from us" and that's that. But one dude who interviewed me for a night shift position at an NOC actually said to my face he didn't think I could do it.
 So, you've already interviewed 5 other candidates whose retinas aren't scarred, and I walk in with a dog and dark glasses. Everything you know about me comes from my resume, which up until this point has put me on the same footing as the other 5 candidates. How do I sell myself?

I've been out of forums for a long time as reddit has served it's purpose for various communities such as /r/sysadmin and /r/MSP.
 So now seems like as good of time as any to check out some forums as a good potential replacement.
 So what else is out there? Obviously I can search around, but rather get good opinions so not to waste time creating accounts on forums that may suck.

 I did this a few times, verifies it perfectly. Contacted support 2 days ago. The case was then escalated and died. Opened a new case this morning, and escalated again. I do not expect to receive a response.
 MigrationWiz went to crap recently. What gives?
 Anyway, if anyone has any insight to resolve this issue kindly let me know as of right now I am SOL.

 The NICs are both Intel Corporation 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection (Lewisville) (rev 04) &
 The switch looks like a TP-Link TL-SG1008D (looks like it, haven't got physical access to it currently).
 I am only getting 30 MB/s which seems very slow. I tested the disks and they are both over 100 MB/s.
 This seems rather slow. The box is not doing anything else significant. I used iotop.
 My guess is it's the cables can remember where they came from but it may have been eBay or Amazon.
 Does this sound likely or is there something I have missed? I'm thinking of getting replacements from somewhere repeatable in the UK like eBuyer or https://cpc.farnell.com.
 What do people think?

 My business currently has me as the IT manager, small team of 3 and a development manager, team of 7. 
 The development manager is leaving and I’ve been offered to take over the managing of both teams. Now I know nothing about development really, at most I use powershell and cli etc. 
 They’re going to bring in a product manager below me to assist in deciding what new features to target and speccing it out, so most of my day to day would be people management and escalation in terms of the dev team. The IT team is going to get an apprentice at the bottom end to help move people up to fill any gaps when I’m not doing my day to day. 
 So two question’s really 
 1- has anyone managed a development team with minimal knowledge, and do you have any info or tips? 2- what would this role be called? Seems like a chance to bump out my CV a bit so want to make the most of it. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I primarily do web development, but recently a long time friend asked me help digitise their legacy workflows as they deal with a lot of paper. 
 I've got them setup with Google Workspace and will be helping on board them with a CRM for client management, as they do work for their same pool of clients a minimum of once a year. But I will also be installing and managing four new Windows 10 office PCs (HP Elitedesks)
 Can anyone please advise any best practices to help secure and manage these computers. I'm not local to them, so will be able to do onsite visits every couple of months, but it won't be like popping around the corner to help them out. So anything I can do to help manage them securely remotely would be appriated.
 I've moved them away from Office and Outlook to web based GSuite. The CRM will integrate with GSuite through the browser. File management will be primarily scanned documents and saved PDFs going onto Google Drive and the CRM. 
 Browsers will be Chrome, probably managed through Google Workspace, uBlock origin installed. 
 Password management either via Google password manager or Bitwarden. 
 Remote support is currently provided by Teamviewer, but I don't' think they're on a paid plan, so I'm sure that will get cut off soon, and so I'll give Chrome Remote Desktop a go unless an alternative good value solution can be suggested?
 Not sure if I should be doing any special configs with Windows?
 Is it worth having a dedicated AV in an office environment in addition to Defender? If so, what are people using?
 Any advise or links to best practices guides would be appreciated on how to approach a small business deployment like this. Thank you

 I want to put it in printer vLAN, but i can't find documentation on what ports are needed
 i found documention for canon business printers, but i guess i won't need all of these ports and i only want to allow the necessary minimum
 ​
 has someone experience with canon selphy printers in this regard or with canon printers in general to guess what the bare minmum ports for printing would be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using a Hyper-V to simulate a network, as I'm building a Group Policy from the ground on up. I have three VMs:
 FS Windows 2019: Network Adapters
  
DCComm [for 'Domain Controller' Communication only] - 192.168.5.15/255.255.255.0/192.168.5.2)
  
My DC: Network adapters 
  
DCComm (192.168.5.10/255.255.255.0/192.168.5.2))
 MyPVT (Communication Between Clients and DC) (192.168.4.10/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.2))
 Ethernet (Auto Assign IP)
  
MyClient: Network Adapters:
  
MyPVT (192.168.4.150/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.2))- Used to access the Internet, through the DC
  
The idea is to use Group Policy Management Console on MyDC to create a folder and copy files to MyClient. I tried first by using a share on my host network, which did not work. The share was going to be USB attached storage from a router, and my DC could not see that.
 I then created a second Windows Server 2019 PC strictly for file shares (detailed above as FS Windows 2019). I deliberately put those on another network (using another virtual adapter) , thinking this would prohibit direct access by the clients. Both DC and FS servers can ping each other, and my DC server can access the share folder on the FS server, but Group Policy is not copying over the files. The folder created correctly.
 To create the folder, I'm using the path: User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Folders and created a folder here with the action being to Update.
 For files, User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Files. Same thing, I'm using the Update action.
 Again, the Folder creation worked, but the file copy did not. Why not and how can I fix this? Any ideas?

I have been in IT for 20 years and been through layoffs, mergers, outages, software roll outs, you name it, which never bothered me.

 How do people stay sane will all the security incidents happening around the world?

 I wonder what year this company works in. For those who aren't aware besides the obvious Win95, you can't even get MCSE anymore from Microsoft.

 But, essentially, I don't treat or think of the IT department in the same business model as the GeekSquad or any other tech service provider. I try my hardest to avoid calling anyone in the organization a "client" because I don't want to encourage this service provider/recipient dynamic. As far as I'm concerned, my function in the org. is to keep the information technology systems and processes working, NOT provide value to you in the form of "customer service". In most situations, "good customer service" and the necessary protocols and SOPs go hand in hand. When they don't, STOP going up the chain of command or berating my "dedication to quality service" because you didn't get what you want, how you want. I am your fucking co-worker doing my part to keep this shit floating, not someone you hired to do as you want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I’ve been trying to implement option 156 in KEA DHCP as outlined in this forum : 
 https://www.shoretelforums.com/forum/shoretel-tech/administrators/650-how-to-configure-option-156-in-linux-dhcpd
 The option has been defined as a string , and I set CSV to true, as I want multiple values to be sent to the clients.
 Unfortunately KEA doesn’t accept “array of strings” as a valid option and will not start.
 After removing the array line, predictably , only the first value is sent to the client and it appears to be a decimal string not a string the same way it was configured.
 Based off this guidance 
 https://ftp.ripe.net/mirrors/sites/ftp.isc.org/isc/kea/1.5.0/doc/kea-guide.html#dhcp4-custom-options
 I am hoping to specify the option as a “record” and specify multiple data types and pray it accepts it.
 Unfortunately I feel this won’t work because “When array is set to true and type is set to "record", the last field is an array, i.e., it can contain more than one value ” will probably just complain about an array of strings again.

This might be a stupid question, but could GoBGP automatically advertise the route if I attach a new KVM device to the bridge? Or do I have to manually advertise the routes via GoBGP cli? If it's automatic, I would really appreciate a working example. I picked up GOBGP because it seemed really easy to use, but would FRR offer me more debugging functionality?

 Sorry if this has been asked a million times.
 I'm quite new to BGP, I know that iBGP doesn't change attributes mainly the next hop. How do Large ISPs generally configure their BGP networks?
 Would they have hundreds of routers within an iBGP AS, using route reflectors, changing editing the next-hop IP and injecting null routes to bring the BGP prefixes into the routing tables
 Or do they have hundreds of small iBGP AS's with 5-6 routers inside all linked together using eBGP?
 The first way was how I did my EVE lab, but was getting tricky/lot of work to implement (around 15 routers).
 Or do they have another method that I haven't thought of?
 Thanks

 I am a little confused and am just looking for some thoughts or feedback on an issue. I have a client that uses an iPhone 6 to stream Pandora in their workshop. The issue is, I can see the device is connected to the Unifi AP (U6-Pro) but the traffic going to and from the iPhone is... Pausing? Pandora loses connection and requires someone to turn the screen on and then it starts playing again.
 I have been pinging the device for a while and I can see there is traffic for a few seconds, like it's checking in, then nothing for another few minutes. Now if someone actually goes and plays Pandora again it will ping for several minutes then the ping stops followed by the music, still connected to WiFi.
 My thought is that there is some kind of "WiFi Pausing" feature that doesn't disconnect the WiFi but pauses the connection? It looks like it's only 2 iOS devices doing this, all other devices remain consistently pingable.
 Device is iPhone 6 on iOS 12.5.7 - No Power Saving Options are on and the Phone is constantly plugged in.
 UAPSD is off
 Thank you in advance!

I understand VNID is what distinguishes a VLAN on a local switch (so each VLAN is given a L2VNI which is the VNID). The VNID is what is needed to distinguish routes when a leaf advertises any type EVPN route to the fabric. But if EVI and VNID are same, why should there be two terms?

For example, if I have a contractor who needs to allow access between two endpoints, he doesn't necessarily need to know anything about those endpoints except their names (to select them from an object-list), configure the required ports etc in a web-form, then the software will determine where policies need adding, and add them.
 Assuming there's already a source of truth configured, and I just need the ACL configuration and deployment bit.

 I have a question about what certificates I should have on a new pair of HA Palo Alto 3320's that I'm setting up, these are severing as our hosted WAN firewalls, we'll be doing SSL inbound inspection on them.
 The main caveat is that the hosted servers that users go to when they go through our hosted NAT rules, are all F5 VIP's, normally, I would just be putting the servers pub/priv key pair of the firewalls, but since none of them are technically where the user goes to when they establish an SSL connection, the F5 VIPs acts as the destination for the NAT rules whenever the hosting IP's are connected to.
 It may seem like an obvious question, but in this case, don't I just use the pub/priv keypair that are on the F5 client SSL profile instead of the servers certificates themselves in a normal instance?
 One bonus question as well, for the decryption policy on the PA, am I right in saying that the scr zone would be the outside, scr ip "any", dst zone (the relevant next hop zone) and the dst ip as the private IP, being the VIP, not the public IP that users will connect to? (I guess the same sort of question applies to the NAT and security policy rules to, that's how I've currently set it all up)
 Thanks all

Currently, it's possible to create a bond with only a single network defined, and CentOS allows this. I can see how this might be useful during a configuration process, e.g. as a means of keeping bond settings around to copy from while configuring another, etc., but that's just UI sugar.
 Is there any use case for keeping it this way? We're trying to figure out if we want our GUI to even allow it. Our product owner thinks that CentOS accepting a single-interface configuration at all should be considered a bug in linux.

 This might be a stupid question... We are trying to upgrade from Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.9.1 to 3.10.3. I have never done this and documents explain how to backup 3.9, uninstall it, then install 3.10 and restore the backup into it. But doesn't explain which version to use that is available on their website? We are using a VM to run out Prime Infrastructure at the moment and are going to use VM for the new version. Which version of Prime Infrastructure do I need? I see these:
  
Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.10 ISO image for the physical appliance. Run, openssl dgst -sha512 -verify CiscoPI3.10.pem -signature PI-APL-3.10.0.0.205-1-K9.iso.signature PI-APL-3.10.0.0.205-1-K9.iso from the command line.
 Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.10 OVA for the virtual appliance
  
From the names alone, it tells me I need to download #2. Is that correct?

 We all know the (somewhat crazy) requirements to run Windows 11. One lesser know requirement (possibly new) not documented (yet) by Microsoft is the size of the EFI system partition. For those curious, the EFI system partition is what computers use to boot and talk with UEFI BIOS. Pretty important to have.

 We own a small commercial building with a little more than 48 ports in the building. 15 or so go to our own company, and the rest of the building is for executive suites that we rent out to tenants. One tenant may be solo, and another may be 3-4 employees. So whatever product we use needs to be able to isolate the tenants to their own secure network. Beyond this, fairly intuitive interface, good security, and any other bells and whistles that may be beneficial to an executive suites building would be great.
 All that said, they are suggesting Sonicwall. I get the sense that this is just who they've been using for a long time. They speak highly of the product they put out... but I did a little reading on a few posts and found they don't have the best reputation compared to others. Maybe in those instances it was for larger clients with different needs... I don't know these devices are a little outside my expertise :)
 Our building is pretty high end and I'd like our networking capabilities we offer to tenants to reflect that as well. Is Sonicwall a good choice, or are there options that we should definitely consider over them?
 Thanks for any and all feedback and opinions.

It was a mess; completely unproductive environment. They had extreme difficulty doing, or even understanding, the most basic of tasks. 
 Since they have to login and out so many times, they do not log out of servers - they lock their sessions. This makes them vulnerable to a Mimikatz attack. 
 Help me see the light. With UAC and SentinelOne/ CrowdStrike,etc. is there any benefit whatsoever to running two logins these days?

 I'm currently on Windows 10 with 16gb ram for the majority of my task force. The CAD users have 32gb.
 I recently made an in-place upgrade to W11 and saw that it use quite more ram. Idle, I sit around 6 to 8gb of ram consumed. This made me think I might have to upgrade everyone to 32gb (or 24? I feel this is an odd number).

 I manage the WatchGuard. Remote side IT manages the Cisco ASA. 
 We've had Cisco TAC and WatchGuard Support involved extensively and they can't figure it out. Initially they thought it was a stuck SA instance, but remote Network Admin has checked that this time around and are not seeing anything like that. 
 We have a total of 6 active tunnels, 5 out of the 6 are working flawlessly and are stable. The 6th one, the WatchGuard will SEND from my end, but does not receive anything back from the ASA. 
 I've been through my config a dozen times and cannot find anything that would be preventing return traffic. To me, it feels like the ASA might have a broken return route back to the WatchGuard's network on that specific subnet. 
 I am aware of the reputation WatchGuard has in this subreddit. Replacing the WatchGuard is not an option and I really think WatchGuard has made some stellar improvements over the last 5 years or so and are solid UTM Appliances. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 My background is more sales and marketing and I have never done this before. I am in effect looking (initially) to "white label" the BT product which I believe is possible. 
 Any guidance on this or consultants who can help are welcome :) 
 Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's an ongoing debate around our office about the need to skill up on containerised workloads. As a mid-market MSP the only thing we run on-prem in a container is a DNS filtering service. Across our entire stack and customer base I cannot find another application for containers. Yet obviously there's lots of talk about this being the future for a lot of applications.
 So my question is anyone running containerised workloads (Docker, Kubernetes, and the sort) on their on-prem infrastructure? If so what kind of things are you using containers to accomplish? Did you write applications in-house that you now host or did a vendor/ISV provide them this way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm inheriting an absurdly unmanaged environment of devices, somewhere around the 100 devices number and there is a large diversity from a couple of Win 3.1 and 2000 devices all the way up to w10. But most of the fleet is a mixture of w7 and w10 (enterprise). As well as the obligatory smattering of Linux devices here and there (mostly RHEL based). 
 The environment is also an 'offline' environment, generally with no direct or proxy Internet access (though I could configure a proxy if absolutely needed to) I'm looking to start tidying up the fleet of...shit. and I've never actually been the one to stand up config tools like SCCM/configmgr, Ansible, Puppet etc. 
 I don't really like the idea of SCCM due to cost the relatively small environment. So am considering tools like Ansible, Chef and Powershell DSC. 
 I like the idea of PowershellDSC as most client endpoints already have the powershell required as well as the native powershell management. And the environment is primarily Windows.
 But it doesn't seem to be used my most people over other config tools.
 Ansible on the other hand seems to be almost the defacto option and is better supported in the community. 
 I'm generally hoping for any feedback or opinions of the two options if anybody has experience of both?
 Another option could be Ansible for POSIX/*nix and DSC for Windows. But this seems like overkill

 I work in an organisation of around 7000 people with around 200 people in the IT department. I'm tasked with improving/sign-off on our naming standards, so far we have (see picture):
 low level account: john.smith@contoso.com
 Active directory privileged accounts using RBAC:
 T0a-smit001 (domain controller and tier 0 assetts)
 T1a-smit001 (Tier 1 assets such as application servers)
 T2a-smit001 (Tier2 assets such as laptops) 
 O365 admins: [jsmith@contoso.com](mailto:jsmith@contoso.com) (non synced account)
 Azure AD infrastructure, 2nd tenancy: [john.smith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:john.smith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com) (non synced account)
 We have more cloud environments coming along... 
 The question I have is what's the best way to manage the naming standard?
 Ideally I want something that's easy to see purpose at a glance, without screaming administrator.
 I'm also getting pushback from people saying they have too many accounts\passwords to remember.
 Also, do you differentiate the account name for things such as contractors and 3rd parties?
 Advice appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for some advice on how to progress with an issue I am seeing for the company I work for (UK based with a .com address).
 It looks like the company that hosts our DNS records has gone bust. Our site and DNS records are available, but all the services for getting into our domain are unavailable (although the host site is still up) along with their telephone number and any ability to log tickets. We have tried looking online for options andcan see a number of comments on sites saying they appear to have ceased trading. Looking at Companies House (register of UK companies) they are overdue and it looks like they may actually have gone under.
 My question is what do we do now? The records are still avaialable and working but we need to get them migrated to a service that we can trust and make changes to. We can't get through to the host to open a request to do this though. I was thinking of reaching out to ICANN as this is a .com domain but I am unsure if there are any other options available to us here.
 Has anyone gone through this before that can give help/assistance on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started working at a manufacturing facility about 5 months ago as a system administrator (or, that's what the position practically is). They basically brought me in to get their systems upgraded, propose projects for development of their infrastructure, and conduct maintenance along with upgrades of software (along with helpdesk).
 There is a database (SQL Server) that is used for collecting sales information for customers. One of the upgrades I am going to be doing is upgrading the version of SQL Server being used along with the Windows Server version being used due to EOL of the server versions.
 Originally, I was going to be conducting the regular maintenance plan of getting software upgraded to latest versions along with some hardware upgrades.
 However, after analyzing the data in the database, I noticed issues that exist within the data itself, including redundancies, inconsistent data, and other issues with improperly built databases. My understanding is this is a database they've been using for years. Based on my experience so far, there have been issues they've had to deal with for a bit because of how the system is set up.
 Something I've been doing is looking at how their database is set up and recreating it using the database normalization techniques to reduce the issues we've been having (on a separate server of course). Along with this, I developed a web based application as a way to interact with this database. 
 I presented my ideas to my supervisor regarding my work and showed what it's capable of. He seemed really interested in it and is going to be meeting with me to discuss it further.
 I've heard the horror stories of lower employees having their work stolen or credit taken by their supervisors. Should I be concerned about this? Part of me wants to go beyond expectations in this role, but I've been told to not do so by others. Should I stick with doing regular upgrades in my role?

However, with the growing number of assets and additional controls expected from the accounting team, we’re now looking for a good cloud solution.
 With so many options and due to the fact that providers adopt different pricing models (some charge by asset, some per user, others per site) and also don’t publish pricing on their websites, I was wondering if you guys could help me with some basic info about the solution you are using:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 we have a fair number of people departing in a few months (education environment) and so we'll be disabling their AAD/Microsoft 365 accounts soon. I've been asked if it's possible to export all data (Onedrive for business/Outlook/Teams messages/Sharepoint Online sites etc.) for some of these users, in case they want to access it in the future.
 As I've stated, since this is an education environment, none of these users had access to any data that would be considered confidential, secure, or anything like that. From what it looks like, there's no way to export this data, neither from their end, nor from the admin center. I did find something about using eDiscovery to do it, but we don't want to use additional licenses or software to do any of this, especially since this won't affect our operations at all. If need be, I'll just tell the users to export their messages and download all their files manually, but seeing as many of them have upwards of 50 or even 100 Sharepoint sites (mainly due to MS Teams, but also manually created groups), I can't imagine this will be wildly popular.
 Ideally, we'd like to know of a way for the users to be able to export their data by themselves, but I imagine that probably doesn't exist, so is there a way to do it from my end without requiring a ton of manual work?
 Thanks in advance for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a sysadmin for 6 years and started with a new company several weeks ago. It's a similar role on paper but the environment, architecture, procedures and policies are very different. I'm having to refamiliarise myself with some basic skills and knowledge that I was educated on during uni but never had to apply in my previous role and also learning 100% new stuff which I feel like I probably should have already known? I feel like I'm pretty slow with the tasks I have been assigned and I'm feeling pretty dumb and useless. 
 My previous job was fresh out of uni so I don't know what it's like to start as a 'skilled professional' at a new company. Is it normal to feel like a fish out of water when you start with a new company doing a similar role or am I just an imposter that got lucky?

 I need to monitor the veeam services on a vm windows server via my centreon poller on centos but there's a problem, the centreon commands return this error: "Status information UNKNOWN: SNMP Table Request: resourceUnavailable (This is likely an out-of-memory failure within the agent)".
 Here's my command /usr/lib/centreon/plugins//centreon_windows_snmp.pl --plugin=os::windows::snmp::plugin --mode=service --hostname=xxx --snmp-version='2c' --snmp-community=xxx --service='Veeam Cloud Connect Service' --warning= --critical=1: --state='' --regexp
 I have already succeeded on other vm quite similar to monitor services so I think it is a problem with veeam. Does anyone have an idea please? Here to answer any question. Thanks a lot.

 ​
 I have a windows computer that perfectly receives it's address from a windows DHCP server in our network. 
 When booting into a Linux OS with a live bootcd (USB) like Ubuntu, Debian, EndeavourOS, ... it all works perfectly and i receive the same IP from our DHCP server. 
 However, on the same computer i tried installing Arch Linux and i booted off the install medium like a normal Live CD but i never get any ip address.
 Arch sees the network card and indicates the interface is up but there is never a response from our DHCP server itself for this OS.
 MAC address is correctly detected and is correct in the DHCP server as well, that never changed.
 The following link shows you the DHCP request for Arch linux and EndeavourOS (Based on Arch).

 Does anyone know why this happens and what i can do about it to solve this ?

 Many thanks !

 I'm working on deploying Hybrid Join for our windows computers in order to reduce the amount of separate logins users have to do for teams, onedrive, M365 services in browser etc. So far this seems promising.
 I'm searching for a way to find information about the tokens available within a session.
 For now, all I have is the "SSO State" information listed with dsregcmd /status. One thing I noticed is that the AzureAdPrtExpiryTime changes when you modify the Prt e.g. by adding and MFA claim.
 Could I get detailed information about which claims and accesses a user has at a given moment, either on the client or in the AAD console? This way I could performe detailed troubleshooting in the event of an unexpected login request.

 Been trying to find if this is even possible. We have a problem with end users directly contacting our helpdesk on Teams. Our helpdesk personel is getting somewhat annoyed by pointing users to the correct way of creating a ticket.
 This will of course not solve the issue, but some users do not know... and some do not really care. So it would at least help and inform the users.
 Is it possible for an administrator to submit a custom status message for a group of people in Teams? We would like to have the ability from the administrators perpective to change this message for all helpdesk users at once.

 We recently got 30 users joining our organization and we want to enroll them in Intune / Autopilot. Our first step is upgrading their W11 home edition to pro so that we can apply the Windows 10/11 Enterprise E5 license and enroll them.
 ​
 We have contacted our Microsoft partner we currently get our licenses from and they quote 180 euro for a W11 pro license, retail pricing is 150 euro and the grey market (CD-keys, G2A, etc) is 15 euro. I have read that Microsoft volume licensing is an option but we don't have access to that.
 The grey market option is attractive however I am worried that the keys might get deactivated in the future.
 Which option would be the best to upgrade 30 users from W11 home to pro?

 The backdrop for this question is that our AD is, when you go way back, originally from 2001. As such it's seen its fair share of server-versions all the way up from WinSrv2000, and I'm still finding remnants of such ever now and then in the form of old built-in accounts, various groups and even the odd dead server or two that hasn't been properly removed from the domain.
 How do people deal with this? Basically set up a new domain within the same forest and move what you want/need over, or do you spin up an entirely new forest with a new domain and then migrate things?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past March our company entered a contract with a provider that provides us with Microsoft E3 licenses. Along with this came some professional services that helped us finish an initial Intune rollout. 
 On call 4of6 with our rep, I casually asked about the impact of a domain loss and name change on our tenant. I fully expected this to be a softball (I was hired on as a level one guy), and that my VP or anyone in our C suite would have posed this question at the beginning of our contract. 
 My rep paused for a moment, knowing our situation with Intune, our current DC, etc. He basically said we might as well not even finish this call, and mentioned how little time we have. My heart sunk.
 Since starting at my company I have been trying to get us onto a more modern platform, one that is easier overall for our users.
 With all that being said, doing double MS e3 licenses for 7 months is a non starter for our leadership. 
 Problem: we have ~650 PCs on old DC, most of which are remote and our VPN solution is a) sophos ssl b) not widely used
 My proposed plan: New DC: All new/current gen pcs are enrolled We redistribute devices on new domain Users continue to use old e3 resources on devices (office licenses) until we are ready to roll out name change and new tenant
 We have to be out of using our old name and tenant Jan 1
 My question: is there any easier way than this?
 Just about anything is on the table as long as I can tangibly point to a labor savings, and make it as easy on our users as possible. We can probably even talk about switching back to o365 and use those savings for some other solution.
 Thanks for taking the time to help a bit with this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I am currently stuck trying to get an additional subnet advertised and talking to Cisco AnyConnect users. I have limited knowledge of ASAs (have mostly worked with PA's in past).
 Here is how the subnets are being defined in access-list.
 #show run access-list VPN-SplitTunnel
 access-list VPN-SplitTunnel standard permit 10.36.41.0 255.255.255.0
 access-list VPN-SplitTunnel standard permit 10.101.0.0 255.255.255.0 
 The problem is after a user connects to the VPN, the new route does not show up in Windows route table.
 Where else do I need to add a route, so the users can receive the route.
 TiA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm not sure what open source package would suit my needs. We have a team of employees and volunteers spread across a few different business locations. They occasionally move from one location to another, and they tend to have very similar questions that our talent managers answer for them. I'm thinking something like resource management (or customer management, but used for employees?) along with a help desk. Are there any web-based solutions already built which might help us manage this? Preferably php/mysql?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got to the office this morning and someone from Finance asked me, "Yo X, is our ERP up yet?" I was confused. "What do you mean, it's up?" She replied, "You know, our ERP is down since 7.30 am."
 I checked and sure enough, our ERP was down. I panicked and started troubleshooting. The server was up and running, and the network was fine. I didn't know what else to do, so I blamed our vendor. I sent them a WhatsApp message: "Hey, what did you guys do? We can't access our ERP." They replied, "We didn't do anything."
 I was at a loss. I continued troubleshooting, but people were starting to get angry and impatient. I remembered that our domain had expired on May 28, 2023, and today was June 2. The domain provider had auto-renewal enabled, but it was attached to one of our directors' credit cards. I called him, but he was still asleep. After 16 minutes of trying to wake him up, he finally renewed the domain. He mentioned that he forgot to change the card detail. 
 I waited patiently for the domain to come back up. My phone could access the ERP, but my laptop still couldn't. I was about to start troubleshooting again when one of my managers said, "Have you tried restarting DNS?" I did, and it worked! Everyone was happy, and we hugged and celebrated.
 Just to share you my little achievement on Friyay morning

 Im looking for recommendations on a solution that can retrieve and store logs from office365, salesforce, and our firewalls. I was looking at Datadog, and betterstack but not sure how well and how the pricing works. 
 For example: - The audit logs or sign in logs for all users in azure active directory. 
  
SharePoint auditing as well like document editing, deletion, etc
 
Firewall changes, logons, etc
 
any changes made in Salesforce
 
We also have other applications that we may be able to work with vendors or their API that we would like events logged

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically what the title says. I've had days where I got about zero sleep the previous night, for one reason or another, and I know that I'm not going to be a very useful human approximation at work. I've debated calling in and using a sick day, but I've refrained from doing so for two reasons:
 1) It wouldn't help me feel any better. When morning rolls around, that's it. I can't nap during the day without completely spoiling sleep the next night unless I'm actually sick. I'm not going to be able to do anything, so I may as well feel miserable and get paid instead of feeling miserable for free.
 2) We've got a small team, and I wouldn't want to let them down. I really like my compatriots, and if I'm out then my share of the work gets dropped square in their laps. If I can grab that phone call from the capo di tutti capi, that lets everyone else keep their concentration on what's important.
 I know that these sound contradictory, but it's a matter of taking the smaller tasks that don't require as much brainpower - stuff I've done a hundred times and is mostly muscle memory at this point - and either passing the challenging stuff off or sending bland updates that extend my deadlines.
 Basically, I'm asking for advice/anecdotes/etc. Thank you.

 For PowerShell, you'll need a function:

 I legitimately use this when troubleshooting some kinds of connectivity issues, and want a simple controlled test.

Majority of L3 task lands on your plate as there is no other L3 tech. Yet the overlord still expects average 10-15 tickets completed per tech each day, so you're forced to handle L1 and L2 to meet your quota. 
 Clients will snap at you believing that with a click of a mouse you should make miracles happen because you work for Magical Solution Provider but unbeknownst to them it's a place where Most Sanity Perishes. 
 Breaking point is near so you request for new L3 techs to be hired and gifted with a response from the overlord "sure that's already in the process." 
 They will hire a handful of new minions and to your surprise...only ONE new L3 that deals only with onboarding and the other new condemned souls now come to you for salvation with issues they can't handle. 
 You will be asked for your input to diagnose a problem, which you will give but yet be asked "did YOU fix it?"
 You sit and stare at your screen with realization you're happy on weekends but severely depressed during the weekdays with ideas of stepping out at lunch time and never returning. 
 Have you been in the same spot and what did you do?

 After that some of our users can not access the company website.
 They still can access any other website, however they can not access our company website. 
 And I found that all users who are having trouble are using Comcast as the ISP. 
 I did flushdns, delete cache, open with a different browser, modem/computer reset. but it didn't work. 
 When I reached out to the Comcast customer service, they only talked about Modem Status. 
 Any Ideas ?

 First 'proper(?)' job in IT, was working for a UK Telecoms company as Customer Service for many years before this role I took late last year.
 The role is IT Service Delivery Administrator. In case that flags anything up for anyone, I know of ITIL, not studied it myself but my manager is going to put me up for it as our new HoIT is keen on adopting a structure pointed more to ITIL than it currently is. 
 So currently, some of my roles and responsibilities include (but not limited to):

Current equipment per location: EdgeRouter 4, UniFi Switch 24 (non-PoE), single UniFi NanoHD AP, 5G failover router, ~4-10 desktops, ~4-10 VoIP handsets, ~2-3 network printers, ~15-20 WiFi devices, camera NVR, traffic counter, digital signage, credit card machine.
 Current Specs: Internet varies from 200Mbps to 1Gbps (max) symmetrical fiber, 6 VLANs, 2 WiFi networks, port isolation. Locations are completely independent -- no interconnection between locations, no VPNs, no internal file shares, etc). No servers -- all hosted services and applications. No printing over WiFi. Short throw for AP's -- long range not needed but WiFi speed is a priority. ~6-12 PoE capable devices: VoIP handsets, WiFi AP, traffic counter. Router cloud management - UISP via Ubiquiti (free). Switch/AP cloud management - UniFi controller via HostiFi ($50/mo).
 Current equipment has been pretty reliable overall. Never had a router go bad. Occasionally an AP/switch will disconnect from the controller and will have to be re-added via SSH.
 Would like to get a next gen firewall, PoE switch and WiFi 6 for each location, all cloud managed. Open to cloud firewall-as-a-service but don't know much about them. Stick with Ubiquiti or not? What products/stack would you recommend?
 Have looked at Calyptix AccessEnforcer, Fortinet, and am intrigued by Firewalla Gold (bought a demo unit but haven't plugged it in); Meraki Go line looks interesting. Open to suggestions.

 I am working on redesigning the network layout in the local government building where I work. We currently have 3 network closets, the Basement and most of the first floor go to the IT office, The Tax office has its own network closet with a cat5e connection back to the IT office, and the 2nd floor has one also with a cat5e connection back to the IT office.
 I want to make a change and have 4 network closets with fiber links all back to the IT office
 finance (Basement)
 1st floor
 Tax
 2nd floor
 My question is what would be the benefit of having a fiber switch in the IT office connecting all the switches together VR just connecting the switches' SFP ports 
 Switches I will be using.
 JetStream 28-Port Gigabit Smart Switch with 24-Port PoE+ (port amount may very) 
 Fiber Switch
 TP-Link JetStream TL-SX3008F V1 - switch - 8 ports - managed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I entered the technology field in 2020, working as a dev intern. I've always had a passion for computers, networks, and programming, and shortly after, I started working with DevOps. Since last year, I have been working as an AppSec Engineer.
 Although I enjoy the technical aspect, I see it more as a hobby. Honestly, I have never felt completely satisfied working in this area, and I have always aspired to move into a management or consulting role once I gained more experience.
 I enjoy working with people and I am quite sociable. I hold certifications such as CCNA, Security+, and CySA+. So my question is: am I still too inexperienced to transition into pre-sales?
 I often read that this role requires a lot of technical knowledge, but when would be the ideal time to make the change?
 TL;DR: I have 3 years of experience in tech (1 year as a developer intern and 1 year in cybersecurity). I am not satisfied with the technical work and want to transition into pre-sales. Do I still lack enough experience, or is it possible?

I don't see how redundancy is offered by having a secondary IP in that if the interface goes down, we loose both the primary and secondary IPs right? Is there something I am missing?

 Has anyone had any experience with building IPSec tunnels on Palo Alto firewalls and then trying to send multicast traffic through them? Specifically I am talking about the Speakerbus appliance used in the securities/stock trading industry. We are having the absolute worst time where nothing we try works. We've tried GRE over IPSec, changing MTUs, convert rules to Any/Any, reviewing logs but nothing seems to be giving us a clue as to where traffic is being dropped. 
 Could definitely use some help/advice.

 I would prefer one that can do segmentation on the LAN and separate rulesets per Vlan or interface. Cloud-managed would be nice too.

 I've recently acquired a couple of AHA374b GZIP accelerators for my personal servers. These cards were released a while back by Comtech's AHA Products Group and boasted impressive compression and decompression speeds.I was pretty excited about the potential they could bring to my setup.
 Unfortunately, these cards have reached their end-of-life/end-of-service status and Comtech is unable/unwilling to provide any access to the related software and drivers.I'm in need of:
  
Linux, Windows, and Open Solaris reference drivers with source code
 Drivers and Plug-ins for Apache Web Servers
  
I was wondering if any of you had experience with these accelerators and might have these resources archived or know where to find them. I understand this is a long shot, but any information or assistance would be greatly appreciated.
 Also, if you've used these accelerators or something similar before, I'd love to hear about your experiences – the good, the bad, and the ugly!
 Thanks in advance!

Disabling DSC may have some negative impact to high-end, end user environments that are running 3 or more displays with higher resolutions or refresh rates such as 4k and above.

 As of right now, the Samsung Book3 Pro looks like the biggest bang for the buck. For about the same price as 11th and 12th gen laptops from Lenovo and Dell, I can get a 13th gen EVO laptop from Samsung with a better screen and webcam (they'll be using webcam quite a bit).
 I will say, I do personally own a Book3 for home use and really like it but it does come with a ton of Samsung bloat. But, that's nothing a reimaging can't fix.
 Has anyone delt with Samsung business, particularly their laptops, in their environment? If so, what has your experience been? Reliability, warranty replacement, support, etc...

 I might be late to the 100G train but here I am. I have a NAS shipping with 100G Aruba HPE 100Gb QSFP28 MPO SR4 100m Transceiver SKU# 845966-B21
 From my research this is has an MPO-12 connector. 
 For the switch side, I had purchased AMQ28-SR4-M1 transceivers (10Gtek, I already have good experience with their 10G model) which apparently have an MPO-8 connector.
 Following further research, I found out that MPO-12 has 4 fibers in the middle that aren't used, thus only 8 fibers are needed.
 My obvious question is, do these 2 transceivers work together? What type of cable is needed?

 Kind of embarrassing but anyway... why spam?
 Info:
  
This is the first time I sent an email to the specific person's email address (maybe attachment and first time sending flagged it, or my wording?)
 I have DKIM, SPF, and DMARC active. my (self hosted email) uses MailGun for outgoing mail. 
 I was curious if it may have went to spam possibly when I didn't hear back for a few days, but I get DMARC reports daily and double checked the report on this message, all passed.
  
dmarc - https://imgur.com/aLUuKxp
 I never had any issues with MailGun's rotating sending IP addresses (in dmarc report). Sent other emails recently to new addresses with attachments and they replied no problem. The only thing I can think of is maybe his I.T. admin has Outlook spam settings set ridiculously strict?
 I set up mail open/click tracking, which may help a a little (assuming receivers don't have images blocked by default), but still curious why this may have happened.
 Thanks and I appreciate any ideas you share

 As it's on an ancient environment the people who know about it have long gone so we're doing a bit of homework first and we need to determine what's actually using the DCs to work out what the risk is.
 I'm not overly concerned about the actual domain authentication itself as that'll generally just work itself out, I'm mainly concerned about LDAP and DNS - is there anything else i'm overlooking here?
 I can turn on the LDAP event logging to identity anything doing LDAP queries, not so sure about capturing DNS queries though...the Windows stuff will be fine, it's weird stuff like Wireless Access Points and other appliances i'm concerned about.
 Any other stuff i should be on the lookout for?

 I have an HPE msa 2050 sas on which I have configured a sas connection with 3 hosts. Connections in the host tab showed up automatically. I connected the machines one by one (first the first port from controller A to the first host, port configuration on the device, then the first port from controller B to the first host, port configuration on the device, and then the next server). Connections look fine. From these hosts, I created a FOC group on the hpe msa 2050 and mapped the drives to this group. Then I set up a cluster failover on Windows Hyper-V 2019. Cluster passed the verification without errors, disks from the array connected without a problem, migration between machines works fine, but one thing worries me, when I run the get-initiatorport command in powershell on node 1 and node 3, it shows me nothing, while on node 2 it shows me all connections. It seems to me that on each server should be visible two connections and not all on one host. 
 Can someone confirm to me if the configuration on HPE is good or has anyone encountered something like this and is it normal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, we have a Logitech Expansion Mic for Group and we're struggling to set it up. The cable we need is 5sm too short. Are there any cable extensions available for it? Because from what I've seen, a 10-meter cable costs $150 USD. Is there any cheaper cable or extension that I can use?

room account has been license explicitly and not using any grouping.
 license expiring soon
 purchase new license
  
My plan is to create a group and assign the license to the group in bulk. then once successful, remove the existing license. However, i understand that to avoid service interruptions, removal and assignment of license should be done on one command. Will i be running into some issue if i add first and remove license later?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team is currently trying to roll out passwordless MFA but are having issues with some users trying to enable phone sign-in inside the Microsoft Authenticator app. For some users, it works like a dream straight off the bat. For others though it is a real pain in the arse.
 We are going to the security info page to add an authentication method (Microsoft authenticator app). Once added we then enable passwordless phone sign-in. The app displays a two-digit number which is entered in and then the phone is registered. The app shows that passwordless sign-in is enabled. However, when a user tries to sign in for the first time, they receive a message stating 'something has gone wrong on our side'. 
 Phone sign-in is then disabled and the user needs to re-enable phone sign-in to try again but this process seems to repeat after every login attempt, and we are unable to see why in the sign-in logs. 
 Users have either a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license or a Microsoft 365 Business Standard + Azure Active Directory Premium P1 License. They are also put into an MFA enablement group which is linked to a CAP. As I stated at the beginning some users it works like a dream, with no obvious differences in user setup. I would appreciate any insight you may have.

 Long short, we had a dr situation, new host has arrived, we have moved over the drives from a backup, but as the system cant have much down time, its about 24 hours out of date.
 So i attempted to use robocopy and a few others which all seem to fail and have the same issue. File path lengths and names.
 System has about 30 shares on it with stupid long paths, all of these programs tell me it cant copy because of length, there does not look like a way around this like there is with newer os version. 
 Can anyone advise a way around this.

 im facing a really strange behavior with Server 2022 and RDP connections.
 Im running on VMWare ESXi 7.0 U2 with Server 2022 Datacenter. The problem occurs randomly on the servers and can be mostly forced by decreasing the hardware of the server to the minimum.
 Once i connect the following screen appears:

 checking the logs showing me a strange messages which not occour when the login succeeds. For eg:

 On several hosts i moreover faced the problem showing a disconnected user using 50% of the CPU. Once i kill the high CPU process the session is killed
 https://imgur.com/a/VdQsxKa
 I appreciate any feedback or ideas to solve the issues. I already tried may things to rule out the problem such as deploying the image from a new clean iso, setting up the vm without domain join etc. Nothing yet helped me the locate the source of the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi gang,
 Apologies if this is not quite on topic. We have an internal application. One function of that application is generating PDF reports generated in Crystal Reports from data in an MSSQL database. This is a fully automated process, no interaction required.
 At present the function calls an SQL query, gets a list of reports to generate, then starts generating them one at a time before 'printing' them to a PDF file with the file name changed. This function currently utilises PDF995 which is slow and at times unreliable.
 This application (currently 32-bit written in VB4) is about to get an update to .NET and as part of this transition we want to move away from PDF995 and to something else we can 'print' a PDF to and specify the output file name as part of the process.
 Wondering if anyone here has a similar set up or knows of one, and can recommend a replacement software product. I'm open to anything be it subscription or a once-off, as long as it's regularly maintained and patched. TIA.

 iSCSI Boot
 Previous version: v3.1.80

 https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-au/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=gxj5g
 iSCSI Boot
 Previous version: v3.1.80
 Current release: N/A
 Similarly for the latest "Intel NIC Family Version 22.0.0 Firmware for I350, I354, X520, and X550" also released 10th Apr 2023, where the previous version was v3.1.80 and current is N/A.
 I have firmware upgraded a "Intel(R) Ethernet 10G 4P X710/I350 rNDC" and a "Intel(R) Gigabit 4P I350-t Adapter" and confirm that the iSCSI Boot Option ROM disappeared after upgrading versions 20.5.0 >> 22.0.0 on both cards.
 I would imagine that iSCSI Boot is still supported perhaps, but how would one configure it and see settings? It's strange that there's no other mention of this at all in the release notes, other than the current release being "N/A".
 I am not currently using this functionality but have in the past. It's quite concerning when features just disappear with no explanation or justification!!

 So much for "never". What am I misunderstanding?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have been asked to assist with configuring some SPAN/RSPAN ports, and while I've done some basic SPAN configuration before, this project is quite large. The project covers 4 different facilities and quite large networks. We're still a little ways out from configuration, but I'm trying to do some homework so I'm more prepared when we get to configuration.
 The basic SPAN/RSPAN stuff seems fairly simple and straightforward, but I guess what I'm struggling to find is any documentation or literature on how to properly "place" SPAN and RSPAN ports/configuration. Mostly just some considerations or best practices for properly and efficiently designing a SPAN/RSPAN configuration. If anyone has any resources, please share!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I was hoping to get some opinions for a situation I can't seem to explain to some of our datacenter folks.
 I help implement and maintain our company's large private backbone/MPLS Network (let's call this out enterprise environment). We have two Datacenters utilizing Cisco ACI with 100G DCI between them. I'm not a data center guy, I'm a transport/radio guy.
 My task is to properly connect the MPLS environment to the two Datacenters. (Currently only commented via legacy DC equipment at one Datacenter only) this task wasnt completed by our senior in 3 years they had to do it and now that person is gone so I'm up.
 My thought is to connect to each DC via EBGP where my MPLS nodes are AS1 and the DC environments are AS2-5 (vPC pairs with separate AS numbers. Idk If that's good design, I didn't set it up and I don't know DC/ACI. I'd almost think each vPC pair would share an AS but have separate AS per DC.)
 Regardless, I'd set route policies to only allow DC to DC traffic to traverse the DCI and any user traffic. From DCA site to DC2 site would traverse the MPLS backbone.
 What general approach would you all take to this? I can provide more details if needed just let me know. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client that has their Office365 tools in a cloud instance with whitelisting. In order to whitelist IPs for our remote workers we have to split tunnel that MS Traffic in to exit our ISP for the whitelisting. 
 I'm using Palo Alto Global Protect and domain forwarding to accomplish this since there are regional IPs all over and VPN users all over. 
 I've basically added every domain found here: 
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams
 This seems to work for the whitelisting, I can see the traffic come in and out and it satisfies the client logon. However active Outlook and Teams sessions seem to go offline and can't show online anymore. I've gone through all sorts of logs and captures and so far I haven't been able to narrow down what and why this is happening. Nothing is getting blocked so the only thing I can think of so far is that there is some traffic that is getting missed (either not on the urls listed above, or direct IPs not getting DNS resolved) and splitting the traffic between two egress points causing the session issues. I'm trying to get something setup to where I can test and capture myself so I don't have to rely on client interactions but for now I thought I'd see if anyone has run into this issue. 
 I'm wondering if there are less domains I can split just for the login and leave all the others.

Fwiw, we are running the 2021 edition. If anyone has any insight on where this is possible, I'd appreciate it.

 I'm playing around with my datacenter lab environment and stumbled upon a problem. Lets say my ISP gave me the IPs 192.0.2.10-192.0.2.20 in the 192.0.2.0/24 subnet (192.0.2.1 is the gateway).
 I want to route 192.0.2.11-192.0.2.20 over 192.0.2.10. Sadly I cannot add a route to the gateway statically or with something like bgp. 
 If I assign the IPs to the router, it doesn't forward the packets because they are (from the routers perspective) at the destination.
 If I use KeepaliveD to fill the ARP Cache of the Gateway and then remove the address from the interface it works until the cache gets cleared. 
 The Router runs VyOS (a Debian based Firewall / Router). 
 Any Ideas and Tips are welcome :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got an email sent to our former Network Administrator from a CDW email address over the holiday weekend that sounded like a catch up / sales call request for a phone meeting. I responded politely to advise that the former Administrator was no longer with the company in our IT department and that we were perfectly happy with our current adobe creative suite licensing in the portal and had no plans to add additional licenses or remove any currently allocated licenses. Thought that was the end of it, I periodically get this type of email from current or former vendors we do or have done business with in the past. I got a response with another email that had been CCed telling me to refer to the linked items for our licensing agreement and that this was not a sales email and the meeting and Audit are required.
 Apparently they haven't been doing audits the past seven years and now they're doing them again.
 We only have a small number of licensed users with the full adobe creative suite which is licensed through their portal user accounts, and each user has a single activated computer or laptop (marketing team members who do graphics or video editing).
 Has anyone been able to professionally and politely tell these guys to go pound sand?
 I didn't care much for the prickly response from them. Had they worded their original email different and told me it was time for a mandatory audit to begin with I would have responded accordingly. The times they requested for possible dates for the meeting fall during my vacation cruise and I handed it off to our IT director to schedule and have the meeting.
 I am pretty sure this isn't a scam, but it sure feels that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For energy saving reasons, we use Wake on Lan on our backup server so that it's only running when it needs to. This one and the main server are connected to a managed switch and both systems are in the same vlan. We have this setup at two different locations, only using different parts.
 At one of the locations, we discovered that network speed in that vlan slows down drastically when the backup server is shut down. After a lot more testing, we found out that this problem occurs with any NIC that is connected in 10Mb/s mode (tested 3 different systems, turned on and off, and manual 10Mb/s and 1000Mb/s mode, both full and half duplex, same problem every time). It's a KGS-1604 switch from KTI Networks. At the other location, using a TL-SG108E from TP-Link, we couldn't reproduce that behaviour.
 Sure, we could just replace the switch, but we're just some 10th graders from Germany, doing some tech stuff mostly for fun and getting some knowledge in IT along the way, therefore we don't exactly have a lot of budget. Most of our hardware was gifted to us or bought very cheaply from neighbours.
 But even if this is not fixable, we would like to know how this could even be?
 ​
 EDIT: Yeah time to say goodbye to that piece of shit, thanks for your advice guys, guess I learned a lesson today: NOT to buy THAT old hardware, no matter how cheap it is.

 We have been dealing with some issues regarding throughput on our 6e APs, leveraging the 6GHz spectrum. We are using a mix of Aruba 635 (2x2) and 655 (4x4) APs. Each AP offers 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz. We are also using the Cloud controller (Aruba Central, on v8.10.0.6_86193, tested with latest 8.10.x as well).
 We've configured a test SSID as we have begun deploying more 6e devices. We're seeing roughly half the throughput on the 6GHz as we see on the 5GHz radio with the same clients, running speed tests and iperf to local destinations (as well as Internet Speed Test reflecting the same). We see this throughput loss across 40MHz, 80MHz and 160MHz wide channels (it scales up as you'd expect with the increased widths, but we still see ~50% loss of throughput compared to 5GHz). …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old slingbox that tries to reach out to the internet for connection to download configuration data several times a minute. This configuration data will brick the slingbox so it is not wanted. 
 I see two solutions. One is to have a packet drop rule at the firewall to drop all these packets from the slingbox. I’ve tried this and it works but I hate the excessive logging. 
 The second solution is to set a dummy gateway in the slingbox gateway field. Unfortunately the device would not let me set 127.0.0.1 and I had to pick a unused ip on the lan. This works great. Nothing is logged on the firewall and I can access the device from the lan as I don’t need internet access to it. 
 So my question is from a network perspective. I’m assuming the dummy gateway on the slingbox to an ip not used on the lan will create additional arp request looking for it every time the slingbox tries to connect to internet for its bad config data via that dummy gateway.
 What would have the least network impact. The dummy gateway method or using the real firewall gateway and dropping all packets to internet?
 I’m assuming the dummy gateway method would free up any logging and load on the firewall but at the expense of broadcast additional arp request looking for the unused gateway ip. 
 So what’s the better solution?

I've read that it's difficult to tell a good traffics and the bad traffics in TCP/UDP fragmentations attack.
 Is it possible to drop any incoming traffic to a certain IP that's fragmented in Mikrotik Router? We want to find out if the service will still work correctly or not if we dropped fragmentation traffics to said IP. I've tried to google this, but either it's not common practice or i'm not googling enough.
 My english is very limited so i might have used some uncommon terms there but i guess it's still understandable.

The thought is to push the mundane, low hanging tasks to the help desk and keep me doing the architecting and high level tasks.

 I've been tasked with setting up some VLANs for a customer environment, and they use exclusively a digital phone system on their workstations instead of having physical phones on the desk. My general understanding is that in a setup with a physical phone you would send untagged traffic from the workstation and tag the voice traffic from the phone, and then they'll stay separated over the trunk link back to the switch, but I'm unsure how to implement this when it's just a single link between the workstation and switch - is it even possible? 
 Any tips would be greatly appreciated :)

 So my question now is, how would I go forward with rolling out this update to my users? 
 I don't want them all to download the GCPW client themselves and install, neither do I want to do it for them manually, one by one. 
 We have no device management where we can roll out software. All our computers are just set up as a normal PC. 
 Would it be smart to write a powershell script that will download the GCPW client and install? 
 I pray that you, the sysgods have a solution, thanks!

 Description
 A core will fail to exit CC6 after about 1044 days after the last system reset. The time of failure may vary depending on the spread spectrum and REFCLK frequency.
 Potential Effect on System
 A core will hang.
 Suggested Workaround
 Either disable CC6 or reboot system before the projected time of failure.
 Fix Planned
 No fix planned
 Despite what they say, the problem actually manifests at 1042.5 days. The TSC ticks at 2800 MHz, and 2800 * 10**6 * 1042.5 days almost equals 0x380000000000000, which has too many zeros not to be a coincidence.
 Note that your server will almost definitely hang, requiring a physical (or IPMI) reboot, because no interrupts, including NMIs, can be delivered to the zombie cores: this means no scheduler, no IPIs, nothing will work.
 Either disable the CC6 (as you did with the Zen CPUs IIRC), or just reboot the damn thing, it's been three years already, you're missing out on a lot of security patches.
 Please read erratas before you start digging, it'll save you at least a day of debugging :(

From my understanding this is layer 7 stuff and a layer 2 switch would be oblivious to it. However, we're having issues after a server was moved, it's pingable, you can access port HTTPS which you get a "Page Forbidden", but that is the server replying at the end of the day. My argument is that the switches are configured properly, all servers are pingable, anything else would be at the application level, AKA on the server.

 Since they will not be installed on a physical servers and not even on the local on premises network, we cannot use the somewhat low cost YubiHSM that you can plug into a physical USB port. AWS has a Cloud HSM that we may be able to use with a EC2, but it’s about $1300 per month.
 So, assuming using an HSM is not possible, what can you do to secure the private keys as much as is practically possible? Just lock away the offline root, limit the network connectivity to the enterprise CA to minimums needed to function and limit the accounts that have access to the online enterprise CA with permissions to view or export the private keys (local admin rights)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I’m trying to disable Windows sign in using PIN and leaving only the username and password but everything I’ve done so far doesn’t seem to work. Long story short, client recently enabled Azure AD sync and all of their PCs started asking for PIN set up upon sign in next morning. They don’t want to use PIN and only a password and I’m not sure where PIN requirement came from.
 I assumed it was due to Windows Hello for Business feature in Azure AD so I disabled it. Only 7 computers have been set up with a PIN and I’m trying to switch back to passwords.
 The computers are unmanaged in Azure. I have tried disabling all policies on affected machines that have anything to do with a password (Logon PIN, Windows Hello for Business). Also disabled “sign in options” registry key.
 After doing all that upon login certain users are still prompted for a PIN. I think it has something to do with Azure since they are Azure AD synced and my admin account is not so I never getting prompted but I just can’t find what’s enabled.
 Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I've run into an interesting/potentially alarming discovery at the office and I wanted some opinions. I'm primarily a SysAdmin but I do have my CCNA so I'm not entirely useless with networking. Our previous NetAdmin left ~2 years ago and we've (I've) been slowly uncovering everything that's been done here as necessary. To say it's over-complicated is an understatement (~100 subnets for a company of then 40 people, not including the /30s for OSPF PTP).
 Background: Our ISP provides us a /30 as well as a /27 that we specifically requested. The /30 subnet is terminated (is that the proper term?) on the ISP's hardware: they provided us x.x.x.124/30, the gateway is x.x.x.125 on the ISP hardware and our IP is x.x.x.126. The /27 is terminated in our hardware connected to their hardware: with block y.y.y.160/27 our hardware has y.y.y.161 and acts as the gateway. x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 are on separate VLANs routable via a VRF.
 The question: is there any benefit to using VRF in this situation? Or is there any benefit to the subnet being terminated by our hardware rather than the ISP's hardware?
 Side note/question: These IPs and the VRF are configured on a switch, not a router and/or firewall. I've further discovered that both x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 provide console access to the switch PUBLICLY. I've since closed that via access lists, but are there any other security concerns regarding this situation?
 Flaired this as routing but it could qualify as security. Thanks in advance!

I sent out a phishing sim a couple weeks ago and now the users are all hyper sensitive. I don't want to misclassify ham as spam...used to be a big problem when we used Bayesian filters if we trained them wrong.

Hand jira related task since i am the global admin. I am getting more frustrated with day passes by.

 We host internally a document management system and the creators of this system offer an externally hosted solution to allow us to share our documents to customers/3rd parties via a web portal (in loose terms).
 Now I've been tasked with configuring this (I've already voiced my concerns that exposing anything to internet is a bad idea but here we are). 
 The system sits inside our lan, behind a watchguard firewall, internally it's running IIS, I need a real world address to resolve to this internal website (i have a dns record setup pointing to our edge IP), I only want to allow one IP external address (or DNS) incoming to access this web server (hoping to make it as secure as possible).
 Would a simple 1 to 1 nat rule suffice, or is there a better smarter way of doing this?

 RANT WARNING: 
 We use Teamviewer for remote support as well as patch management and remote scripting. 
 Converting clients to the newly updated interface is longwinded when it works, but lots of our devices have failed to update with no explanation as to why. 
 The clients listed in the management console application only seem to show up half the time. And often assett lists fail to load anything at all. 
 Adding to all this the navigation is very unintuituive. It took me 5 minutes to find where to execute a script. It is done from the list of company devices and hidden under a drop down, not the remote scripting tab (why??????). 
 Congratulations TeamViewer, you have turned a mediocre patch management system into a terrible one. I'm open to change, but your UI is now utter garbage. 
 Thank god our contract is up for renewal in a few months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My whole career has been in IT. Started out repairing computers in 1991 and worked up to an IT Manager overseeing a large public organization’s infrastructure. I'm basically just a "crusty old Cisco guy" when you get right down to it. I'm likely older than a lot of folks on here (51) with about five years left before I can retire. I'm curious to know if anyone in my shoes has ever made the switch from IT to a "real" job? 
 We have an Energy Manager position opening up later this summer. My degree (from 1993) is in Electrical Engineering. I've worked on enough Facilities projects over the years that I could likely put together a good enough functional resume to at least sit an interview. Honestly though, as weird as this sounds, I'm not sure what people outside IT really do? The thought of not being responsible 24x7x365 for umpteen thousands of end-users seems a bit surreal. Not thanklessly fielding after-hours calls, giving up PTO because of unexpected issues/projects, or measuring success with anything other than network uptime all seem like foreign concepts to me. 
 If you've left IT after a substantial period, what were some of the things that surprised you? Would you share some of your experience with me on that transition? Thanks in advance to anyone that responds and hope everyone has a good day.

Someone had gotten a phishing e-mail and asked if it was legit; spolier it wasnt. So i quickly respond to him: «No thats a phishing email, just report it.» Not thinking about it anymore, maybe 1 hour goes by or so and i recieve another e-mail, me not paying attention manage to open the attatchment from the previous mentioned e-mail. It took 1.1 ms to register what i had just done, it didnt even manage go load up before i managed to close it.
 Seeing as i have no idea what was contained in that file i had to go through the entire checklist
 Virus scan
 Reset passwords of other accounts which have been used on that computer/browser
 Check network logg
 Check registry logg
 Reinstall Windows.
 My biggest fear was that i was logged into Intune on an admin account if they could have hijacked the session.
 I sent the contents of the file to someone who could deobfuscate it:
 It just redirected you to a phishing website, no hidden malware.
 TLDR; Opened a phishing attachment and had to reset a lot of passwords and reinstall windows.
 Always pay attention, missclicks happen. And always delete emails containing phishing files/malware.

The problem now is, that as soon as we set a shared Mailbox to auto connect to User Mailboxes the Shared Mailbox connects to the Users Outlook Profile, but than starts requesting a Password even if the user has full access to the Shared Mailbox. If we turn off auto connect for that Shared MB and add it manually to the Users Outlook, there will be no PW request at all. We tried, cleaning old PW locally and also recreated the Outlook Profile without any luck. The same happens also with a non domain/non Intune Managed Private device. Anyone has an idea where that behavior is coming from? Thank you very much guys!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have just moved from our old VMware stack to our new Dell Azure HCI stack - everything has gone well ( We used Veeam Instant Restore to move VMs) however - I've hit an issue and I am struggling to find any answers.
 We have some CAD software that's MAC Locked and also protected by a USB dongle. I know how to sort this in Hyper V but I am having zero luck getting USB to work. The Dell servers are all in Lockdown mode for IdRAC - Not sure if this disables USB. Additionally, I cant find a setting to allow USB passthru in Windows Admin Centre. I've tried connecting with Hyper-V manager directly to one of the nodes but this fails.
 Any Ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't gone too in-depth with proper foresight into getting our Active Directory into tip-top shape. Now we need to really revisit how we have structured our AD OUs in a much better way. From a top-level OU structure, we are planning to have the DC site location with the structure as -
 Site-Location:
 OU Level 1- Building/Office 
 OU Level 2 --Department
 OU Level 3 ---Users/Computers
 We have some challenges here and not sure if the above structure will work:
  
Some buildings/offices may have a mixture of different departments that exist in other buildings/offices in the same site.
 Some users may be in multiple departments, so should we create all department containers in all buildings/offices as a pre-step to avoid extra work in the future?
 Some "special category" computer group policies we have applied to specific department machines which should not apply to all departments, would it be wise to create OU Level 4 for these machines? Specific policies are for example: Exceptions to Windows Screen lock-out, Allowing phones to be tethered to CPUs, Allowing USB access. This would create the GPO mapping side to be a little more tedious for us. So trying to prevent as much work as possible here.
  
Any suggestions on proper structuring from AD Veterans would help. Thanks!

 I am in the process to learn MS Azure SC-300 Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator for my certificate and i was wondering:
 Almost everyone I know uses username + password + 2fa code at once OR username + password > 2fa code.
 Lets say a hacker tries to get in with username and password. Since the 2fa comes later, it is possible for him to know, if the password he brute forced is right or not...?
 Why dont organisations do username > 2fa code > password?
 So they wont know if the pw was right or not and 2fa code is changing all the time anyway?
 Thanks in advance.

 Good morning everyone! Let me pic your brain. I have a situation where we need to access (provide support) to different customers but many of them refuse to have an active connection.
 Let me explain better, we need to be able to dial into windows machines on our customer networks but they refuse to have a site to site VPN, client to site, team viewer, RDP etc… they want to have an in demand solution where we only access when they allow us to. Quick support isn’t an option as we cant control the device per se. Wouldn’t it be cool if we could do that natively?
 I am trying to get my head around it but any ideas would be more than welcome

 ​
 I have an strange issue i cant find much information about on the internet.
 I did a dhcp / print server migration a couple of days ago on 2 locations.
 Exported the dhcp settings with powershell and imported to new one.
 DHCP is working fine , and clients are getting IP:s from the new servers.
 The servers are authorized and i can see them in the list of authorized servers.
 After the migration i cant see any scopes anymore (this worked before migration) , only on one location (1 out of 6) and thats the head office dhcp server.
 Red "Stop sign" over the dhcp server and says "There are no items to show in this view".
 I can see the scopes locally on the server but not from my own computer with RSAT tools.
 ​
 I´ve tried running as different users / run as admin.
 Rebooted servers.
 Reauthorized DHCP servers.
 ​
 But still no luck. Anyone know what could cause this?

 The CALs are purchased based on the number of users and devices accessing your servers regardless of having 2 servers of the same OS or older or 2,000 servers, correct?
 Then server OS licenses are based on the number of physical or virtual CPU cores in each server with a minimum of 8 per server? However, if you are running Windows Server Datacenter, you can buy Datacenter server licenses based on the number of physical cores on the host machines and that covers an unlimited number of virtual guest copies of the OS running on the hardware?

 My question is this -- would you allow a CEO to send to a standard contact group a few times a year... and then create the contact group and let them go crazy? Are there restrictions you would put on this? Would you insist it go through a marketing email campaign manager due to risk of reputational damage?

I inherited this system with no documentation, no backups, all the classics on here.
 I was fortunate to talk to some members of another institution similar to mine just up the road, and they offered for me to visit their site for a bird's eye view of how they run things (thank God they took pity on me). I'm trying to make a list of things to ask and not ask - I don't want to burn bridges by being invasive and I don't want to walk over and say 'teach me everything', but at the same time I want to make sure I can benefit from this experience.
 If you had the chance to tour another IT environment and learn from it, what would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had the good fortune to get interviewed by a few recruiters over the past few months and the ones who didn't push me through all said the same thing. I don't have experience working on a team this big. Which really sucks and shouldn't really be a factor. I have 11 years of IT/sysadmin and web dev experience.
 I've been a jack-of-all-trade type for about 9 years between two companies and my consulting on the side. I also have sales b2b experience for 4 of those years. I know how to pick up systems and processes really quickly and easily. I am currently teaching myself full stack development and cybersecurity concepts (since I want the CISSP by the end of the year). I have always been employed and am a good worker, yet these recruiters treat me like some unemployable person.
 The problem seems to be that I don't have a structured IT career progression and a lot of it is self taught. Mostly because I was the guy the incompetent managers hired to fix things. Yet somehow I am not getting this picture across to recruiters or they don't believe me when I say I work well with others. I know that there is some disconnect between my experience and what companies are looking for. I do believe it is the fact that I have never been in a company that was larger than 500 people. This seems to have hurt me in my job searches. Even though there was diversity, teamwork, irate end users and all that comes with any IT job.
 Is there any advice out there for a sysadmin who is looking to gain exposure to technologies at a large company? I am not dumb and I can handle sysadmin work, but why do the recruiters not want to hire you if you weren't in THAT specific industry? Using THEIR specific tech stack?
 Are they not understanding that the things I've done match their requirements (but on a smaller scale)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see a lot of vendors offering NaaS (Network as a Service) where the hardware, software, licenses, configuration, and refresh cycles are consumed "as-a-service" .
 ​
 NaaS sounds like a threat career, but I'm wondering how others feel.
 Does anyone with first hand experience either at the consumer of NaaS or the vendor mind sharing? 
 Is there still a role for a network engineer at a company that consumes NaaS? And if so, what does that look like?

 My work is divesting company A, 300 users. Company B will not be providing SharePoint admin rights to give me the ability to migrate the data with a third-party tool. I need to work on an alternative, either export the users OneDrive data to an external drive or export to Company B Azure blob storage, I've never tried this. I will be happy to hear any ideas.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accounting received a legitimate email from said third-party stating the invoice is due, then a few days go buy and they receive the exact same email again only this time the from email is off 1 letter, for instance instead of accounts.payable@xyzcompanies.com it's accounts.payable[@xyzcompanie.com](mailto:walt.disney@xyzcompanie.com). Everything else is identical, even the email signatures. There was also about 10 other emails copied so at first glance it's not really noticeable. After reply this was followed up by we changed banks, plz see attached for new banking info and then accounting paid it...
 We use o365, mfa is enabled and we even do semi-annual training with knowbe4 to be aware of this type of stuff. Now IT is being asked to investigate but honestly there's not really much we can do from here. The spoofed domain was recently registered and all the mail records are setup correctly so it slipped by all the scanners. Email also had a warning in the body that we add to be cautious as this is coming from outside the company. 
 Now we are wondering how a scammer intercepted the communication and was able to phish it. We've seized everyone's laptops that were involved and locked their accounts. So far nothing suspicious, no message rules, no unknown logins, no malware. We are wondering if it's on the vendors end but even if it is I don't think you can really hold them responsible
 I guess this is just a warning to ensure your user base is well-informed about phishing. If anyone has any tips let me know. They are already trying to reverse the transfer but it's been weeks since it went through. They didn't even know until the legit vendor followed up a month later and said the balance was still unpaid. 
 Said vendor also isn't a small fry and is a multi-billion dollar global company. Crazy someone can register a domain 1 letter off.

 My supervisor is leaving. He was in a managerial role and did all the paperwork and reports and meetings. He covered me when I took trips, and was my backup when I needed to bounce ideas or troubleshooting around.
 I, the net and sys admin, do 95% of all IT related tasks, and we lost our low level techs over a year ago, but we positioned in a manor where I can pretty much run the place alone. It's not a lot of work.
 Their isn't enough work for two techs of my skill level IMHO, and the management stuff is signaling that the IT reports, etc of the managerial role can be scaled down. 
 So, idk what to recommend to the business, and quite frankly I'm stressed out. Can I run the place myself? Sure. Do I want to do that and never get a free thought to go on vacations unbothered, etc. No. But there isn't enough work for two techs. If I brought someone else on we would be twirling our thumbs and it would turn into a revolving door of techs I'm sure.
 What do I do here? Is an MSP an option? Do they help with windows servers, help desk, and Linux servers? I have zero experience dealing with them.
 Do I hire abother tech and we just shoot the shit most of the day? I'm beyond stressed over this, and considered polishing my resume myself but the company really needs me and I really like the people who run it, it would be hard for me to do that to them.

 Does anyone know if ethernet-to-fiber converters can be used with plain old telephone service? Obviously, there are physical differences between RJ-11 and RJ-45.
 I purchased Primeda-tronic 2 Ports RJ11 Telephone and 10/100Mbps Ethernet Over Fiber Converters that worked for a few months, but I believe one of the converters has given up the ghost.
 Any information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I'm wondering what options others have come up with for this? We have been accessing the user's files via the admin center and web interface, but it's just so clunky to do it this way when they have a large amount of stuff out there. The MS Sync method has given varying levels of success as well.
 I've seen third party tools that offer Onedrive cloud connectors like Filezilla and such, but they only give you access to the Onedrive of the person logging in. I've seen feature requests for these to add the ability to access the Onedrive's of others the admin has access to, but it looks like there is a technical issue to doing this?
 Does a good solution exist for admins to get at the contents of User's Onedrives without having to mess with the web interface download?

When connected to a Loadmaster and looking at the statistics, I am trying to understand what the Total Conns means. Is that just a connection for an individual service, port, user connection, etc? It is a total connection over 24 hours? The ask is because I do not know why some of my numbers are so high, when the system is a test system and not heavily utilized by more than a few people, however the total connections is over 2000.
 Seems Kemp questions are pretty vague here in this sub, but I am hoping for the best. If I should post this in another sub I can do so. Thank you in advance for any help.

Pretty easy to understand, but I’m stuck on one concept and the class materials are not explaining. So, the Physical Active Router handles ALL of the traffic, including ARP requests, which are first sent to whatever router the host is connected to. What if a host is physically connected (through the topology that might include some switches) to the router acting as Standby? The book/class doesn’t mention it, but is there a requirement that there be redundant L2 paths for hosts so they can potentially reach ALL routers participating in HSRP?

 I kind of want to take on a side project to leverage some Cisco API to identify potential bugs related to upcoming changes across a large array of platforms and IOS/NX/XR versions. So I guess this post is for one of two things.... has anyone done anything similar to deal with one-off bugs that would be hard to identify in a lab environment before changes, and 2.... is there a solid Cisco API that I could parse against a keyword or software function (eg: BGP, SNMP, etc) and a list of device types/versions to try and proactively identify these types of issues? I'll be using Python, but language/nuances don't matter too much as I know not everyone here is super familiar with code.... more looking for if anyone knows manual methods or data sources/api's they've leveraged in the past that I can put code to in order to make a web front end that does these checks for us prior to changes.
 Thanks for any info!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My apologies in advance if this is the wrong area for this kind of problem or if it's too simple.
 I'm an old dinosaur who used to set up office VPNs about 15 or 20 years ago. These were simple VPNs which allowed remote users to access their documents at their office.
 The method back then was to set up a vpn connector on the laptop, point it to the public IP, and set up forwarding for a couple of ports in the router. Then IIRC I'd set up permissions in their account on the server.
 I've been called upon to set up a VPN for someone, and it looks like things have changed remarkably. Whn I search in order to bone up, most returns are for commercial VPN companies who are focused on providing anonymity on the web.
 Has my method of creating simple VPNs become completely outdated? I assume that security issues and methods are very different nowadays.
 Are there any good resources out there to re-learn basic VPN principles and best practices? Perhaps as I've gotten older my search capabilities have dwindled, or else I'm so hopelessly out of the loop that I don't even know what to search for within the context of small office VPNs. If anyone can steer this old coot in the right direction I'd greatly appreciate it. Again, I apologize of this question is not appropriate for this group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying to apply Voice, Video, and some critical data QoS to out network. I've done the research on how to create a class-map, policy-map, and how to apply the policy-map to the interface. However, when I try to apply the policy-map, it is getting rejected with error message:
 "Invalid queuing class-map!!! Queuing actions supported only with dscp/cos/qos-group/precedence/exp based classification!!!"
 I've tried using both dscp and cos just as the message is saying, but the policy-map won't get applied to the interface.
 class-map match-any VIDEO
 match protocol rtp video
 match cos 5
 class-map match-any VOICE
 match protocol rtp audio
 match ip dscp default
 policy-map QOS-POLICY
 class VOICE
 priority level 1 percent 25
 class VIDEO
 priority level 2 percent 25
 This is the class-map and policy map that is currently configured. Our switch is Cisco Catalyst 9500-40x. Is there switches that can't accept certain QoS configurations? I've read that the interface supports certain QoS traffic and this is the result of the interface i'm trying too apply this to:
 TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 Model: C9500-40X
 Type: SFP-10GBase-LR
 Speed: 10000
 Duplex: full
 Trunk encap. type: 802.1Q
 Trunk mode: on,off,desirable,nonegotiate
 Channel: yes
 Broadcast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Unicast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Multicast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Flowcontrol: rx-(off,on,desired),tx-(none)
 Fast Start: yes
 QoS scheduling: rx-(not configurable on per port basis),
 tx-(2p6q3t)
 CoS rewrite: yes
 ToS rewrite: yes
 UDLD: yes
 Inline power: no
 SPAN: source/destination
 PortSecure: yes
 Dot1x: yes
 Breakout Support: not applicable
 Is the interface compatible for the QoS?

 I work for a smaller organization with one main location and a few remote employees scattered around the United States. We rarely have visitors in our main location, so communication with clients is done completely through email and video conferencing. 
 Most of our consultants and executives are well beyond the age of retirement. The only exception is my boss, who is the CTO. We've had this issue where the CEO struggles to handle Teams, Zoom, or Webex calls. Sometimes he unplugs his headset, or mutes himself and thinks his entire computer is broken.

 I'm trying to find a configuration which will allow me to use IPv6 prefixes from multiple ISPs. I've tried configuring multiple prefix delegations on the gateway router, and the end-devices receive IPv6 addresses from both ISPs, but the traffic ends up being black-holed (I'd love to know why, if anyone can tell me).
 My current gateway is an Edgerouter 12, but hardware isn't a blocker if I need something more advanced. I have familiarity with PFSense, Cisco and a bit with some other vendors.

 line vty 0 2, line vty 3 4, line vty 5 31 
 Then others will be 
 line vty 0 4, line vty 5 98 
 And some other ones too with random numbers.
 Is there an easy way to reconfigure these so that every switch is the same? I know the commands to do so, but Will I lose ssh connection and have an unreachable switch if I delete all the vty lines and then configure new ones?
 I need to change the session timeouts on all the switches and its tough to push a config change out when all the vty lines are different.

 Now what the hell would that be? I don't know. According to Google- "The role exists to ensure that the company consistently delivers, and the customer consistently receives, excellent service and support."
 Sounds a lot like customer service rep to me.
 What is up with this trend of calling every role an engineer??? What's next the "Service Delivery Architect"? I get that it's supposedly used to distinguish expertise levels, but that can be done without calling everything an engineer (jr/sr, level 1,2,3, etc.). It's just dumb IMO. Just used to fluff job titles and give people over-inflated opinions of themselves, and also add to the bullshit and obscurity in the job market.
 Edit: Technically, my job title also has "engineer" in it... but alas, I'm not really an engineer. Configuring and deploying appliances/platforms isn't really engineering I don't think. One could make the argument that engineer's design and build things as the only requirement to be an engineer, but in that case most people would be a very "high level" abstraction of what an engineer used to be, using pre-made tools, or putting pre-constructed "pieces" together... whereas engineers create those tools, or new things out of the "lowest level" raw material/component... ie, concrete/mortar, pcb/transistor, software via your own packages/vanilla code... ya know

 I have a pair of S5232F-ON running OS10 10.5.5.3 configured as a VLT pair.
 The manual is pretty vague on DHCP snooping - it says all you have to do is configure "ip dhcp snooping trust" on the uplink that faces the DHCP server, and then enable "ip dhcp snooping" globally. I've tried this, and as soon as I turn on DHCP snooping globally, attached systems can't get DHCP any more. As soon as I turn off snooping, DHCP works again.
 Support say that as no bugs have been reported with DHCP snooping, it must be that I've misconfigured the switch. This is entirely possible but not very helpful!
 If anyone knows how to make it work for sure, I'd be very interested.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
 I am currently a Telecommunications technician at a data center and have been working on trying to move my career foreward. I think I am mostly looking for any ideas, tips and tricks, and/or a curriculum on how to best make the move into network engineering or a similar field. I love the trouble shooting part of my job but the long drives to my work place and the physical wear and tear on my body are starting to beat me down. I have an extremely strong knowledge on anything layer 1 and have been working on passing a JNCIA cert. However I feel that may be a waste of time. I am toying with the idea of reaching out to a recruiter and seeing what they could find me and see if any companies are willing to take on someone like me to train up. 
 I was originally a fiber splicer technician working ISP and OSP, until I got my current job. However I feel my current title is very undescriptive of what is expected of me. I work closely with our in house Cloud, Neteng, and syseng teams and have picked up small bits of knowledge along the way. I've attempted to move into the department but management of my department has a hard time working well with others and is seeming to be blocking me. I would love to get work that can be WFH at least part of the time as I now have a one year old and want to be around more than I currently am. ( I work 5 days most of the time, 10 hours with 4-5 hours of travel depending on traffic. ) Any and all advice would be welcome. Thank you all so much. 
 TLDR: Telecommunications technician with layer 1 experience looking to move into the Networking field. Looking for thoughts and opinions on how to make the move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I'm running Proxmox with one physical interface, eno1, and two virtual interfaces, vmbr0 and vmbr1. vmbr0 is bridged to eno1 for a few VMs/containers to sit directly on my LAN. vmbr1 is a private Proxmox LAN and is NAT'd through vmbr0 to access the internet. I have a web server on 10.1.0.5:443 and have a DNAT rule in iptables to achieve port forwarding:
 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.1.0.5:443 
 The problem is that when traffic comes in from the bridged devices, this rule ends up applying since it's coming in on vmbr0 and then getting forwarded out. How I can make this rule apply only to packets that originally come from eno1 or distinguish it in some other way? I'd prefer not to just put exceptions for each individual bridged IP. I'm still pretty new to iptables so any help or clarification for any misunderstandings I may be having is very appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am a solo sysadmin for roughly 60 users across two sites and I am in the process of migrating all workstations from MacOS to Windows. Due to budget constraints, our migration is slow. We have ~80 workstations and started replacing one every month in July of last year. The reason this is relevant is that we are going to have a mix of MacOS and Windows for a while and processes can't just be switched over.
 Here are a few questions that I have and any advice would be greatly appreciated:
  
Because the office is primarily Mac-based, domain administration tools (AD, GPO, etc.) have never really played a major role except for email (on-prem Exchange server). This gives me the perfect opportunity to rework the domain setup to my liking regarding policies and organization. How have you approached this in the past? 
 
Some of our users have only ever worked on a Mac so they would need training right from the basics on working with Windows. How have you handled user training on the new OS? Are there any good user guides out there that cover Windows 11 from the basics and would be easy to navigate for tech-illiterate users? 
 
Due to the sometimes huge process changes, I find that a lot of users will try to tweak the new processes to emulate their MacOS experience, often making their Windows experience a lot more complicated and increasing frustration. How have you helped users adopt new processes and help them see that the new processes, although different, are more efficient and will make it easier for them to do their job?
 
 I know this is a pretty lengthy post, but I really appreciate any responses to my above questions.

The migration itself went fine, we set up a Hybrid and moved everything over gradually.120+ somewhat mailboxes but than the issue; 250+ GB of Public Folders and around 9000 folders at that time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We are testing conditional access MFA using the following policy: 
 Users: Specific group
 Cloud apps or actions: All cloud apps
 Conditions: All trusted locations (Our HQ)
 Grant: Require authentication strength: Custom strength
 Session: Sign-in frequency 30 days
 Session 2: persistent browser session
 The custom authentication strength is almost everything enabled except FIDO2, cert based auth, temp access pass (multi-use) and all of the single factor auth options. 
 This all works quite well for most of our users in the testgroup. However we do notice some bugs or issues.
 1 user needs to re-authenticate OneDrive every day. Sometimes in the middle of the day after a few hours of active use.
 Another user is seeing pop-ups in windows that the account in use has issues/ is broken.
 We also noticed that this user also needed to re-authenticate his workdevice, even though this is an Azure/ Intune joined device. 
 The question:
 Is there something in the authentication strenghts that we need to enable/ adjust?
 Or
 Are there any known issues with the conditional access grant 'require authentication strength'? 
 Before the switch to 'require authentication strenght' we used the origional: 'Require multifactor authentication' for our MFA tests. This worked fine and as excpected.

 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks!
 Formerly in our company we had like 10 employees before I got here almost 2 years ago. Now we are 4 employees (including me). 
 The situation at the workplace
 I am focusing on everything IT-related. They have set up a domain network with 4 windows machines and one windows 2012 R2 server. The employees login through the domain meaning its dependent on the server to work. 
 - Every employee has access to the other employees computer (except for mine)
 As some of you know Windows Server 2012 R2 is about to reach its end of life and so does the software we run on it. 
 ​
 Suggestions needed
 Why even bother logging in through a domain at all? Why cant I just setup each computer individually with local accounts? Going with a server is just overkill and its just consuming alot of power (and is also getting very warm in my office). The software that the server is providing with the other users basically just needs a visible-over-network folder. Meaning I can just "share" a folder in the network with a smaller, not so hot running but modern computer running windows 10 and just share the folder with the other windows 10 machines. 
 I think the server solution for us is just too much work and pointless in our current situation. Are there any concerns about turning the logins of my employees into local accounts?
 I didnt know who to turn to and reading this reddit has helped and inspired me alot for my workplace and I really hope it fits with what the community is about

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I've been trying for some time to configure Windows 10/11 to work in kiosk mode while also running Docker service and containers in the background. Here are my considerations so far:
  
Containers in Docker Desktop on Windows 10/11 are user-specific, not system-wide.
 How can I run containers that I started on one account while configuring kiosk mode for another account?
 I generate kiosk configurations using Windows Configuration Designer from the Windows ADK package.
 Microsoft's documentation in this area is extensive, but it doesn't cover running background services or containers.
 Apart from Docker and containers, I want the kiosk to launch Windows Classic Apps by specifying the path to the executable file, which I have already tested.
 I don't want the Docker Desktop window to be accessible to the kiosk user.
  
Any additional recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a customer that uses windows 11 to access an L2TP vpn. The configuration worked up to about 10 days ago, now it does not work anymore. 
 The vpn is configured as split tunnel, so internet traffic stays out of the vpn.
 He connects to his wifi at home, then to the vpn, and after just a few minutes (or even just one minute) his internet connection dies. It seems to be connected but he cannot do anything on the internet and of course inside the vpn too.
 He connects to his wifi hotspot on his phone, same issue
 He connects to his home router via a network cable, everything is fine.
 So it seems that when he uses wifi and the vpn, his wifi somehow dies, traffic just stops.
 I have tried setting up a win11 PC the same way (he's VERY remote, so I'm not going to his home, I must solve this remotely) and my win11 PC has the same problem. 
 Googling "win 11 wifi l2tp vpn not working" or something similar gives no meaningful results, so I'm here asking if someone else is experiencing this issue.

 I have tried every possible combination of SFP module, tried to configure the ports in many ways but nothing seems to work.
 I wanna ask if in your opinin it is possible that these switches are just not compatible because I have tried replacing both switches, one at the time, with various ones and always worked except in this one condidion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked with investigating the options for on-call alerting software for my company.
 We already use incident.io to manage any incidents themselves, and track metrics and trigger alerts with DataDog, both of which are integrated into our Slack workspace to send messages to a custom channel. But neither currently support sending out either SMS or phone call alerts to an on-call engineer (and we can't wait to see if they are building it). If everything else was A+ I would accept app/push notifications, but using the mobile phone network is first choice.
 The reason I bring up those existing systems is because a lot of tools out there (PagerDuty, BetterUptime etc) cover a lot of the same bases as well as the on-call alerting, so we'd be paying a fair chunk of change for features we have no intention of using. I saw a recent blog post about PagerDuty alternatives, but from my reading many of the listed products are covering the incident management portion (like incident.io), but missing the actual alerting via SMS or phone call (out of hours, when we can't expect engineers to be paying attention to the work Slack).
 This needs to be a SaaS solution, because we want to be able to alert in the case that our entire platform on which all our own stuff is hosted is having issues. Given that we're entirely in AWS currently it also shouldn't go down if AWS has issues.
 What products are other people using? Would you particularly recommend or warn against using it, or is it just 'good enough'? Is there anything out there that really focuses on the callout schedule and actually calling people out, rather than all the rest of the management and tooling around that?

 To give more context : I'm the sole IT in a 100 users company, basically manage everything, but I joined just one year ago and I have no history regarding this, I started as helpdesk and climbed my way so I don't exactly know best practices regarding this. 
 My initial idea was to unplug it and store it in a safe place so that I can reuse it if any disaster occurs, but I feel like it's a waste of resources. I could for instance make a complete test environment which I currently don't have (I only have test machines and systems for very specific things). 
 I may also try to use it as a lab, for instance to test new things (learning a bit more about Proxmox which I think may be enterprise-ready for some time in the future, already use it privately and would like to try on on high-end machines).
 Same thing happened with my previous ESX hosts, I basically unplugged them and stored them even though they are still perfectly functionning. I budgeted their replacement and didn't have enough rack space to keep them on, so I stored them safely. 
 Anyone care to give me general advices on what to do with them ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 Seeking the hive mind as i've exhausted most other options here.
 A users Excel always hangs for 5 - 10 seconds when closing, the file can be on OneDrive (Local), Network Share or even a blank workbook. It sounds pretty trivial but its actually very frustrating to work with.
 This is a new Windows 11 machine (4 months old), it's a pretty well spec'd workstation for office use.
 - The behaviour is not repeatable when starting excel in Safe Mode. 
 - The behaviour is repeatable with no Add Ins enabled.
 - The behaviour is not repeatable when using another user account on the PC (domain joined). 
 - Office is the latest version.
 - Tried many small online fixes (Disabling hardware acceleration etc etc).
 What else does Safe Mode disable that might be causing Excel to hang like this?
 I've yet to do a fresh install of office as i feel it probably wont make any difference.
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks

 I recently made the tough decision to quit my first job as a sysadmin, and I'm seeking some advice to validate whether it was the right move or not. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I want to provide all the necessary details.
 I started this job about two months ago, excited to kickstart my career as a sysadmin, after 2 years stuck in the helpdesk. However, things haven't gone as planned. My primary responsibility was to develop and roll out our CRM system, which initially seemed like a fantastic opportunity for me to learn and grow. Unfortunately, the project got stuck due to platform issues, and no one seemed proactive in resolving them or assigning me other meaningful tasks.

 Over the weekend I pushed out a group policy to define the "Log on as a service" permission to some service accounts. This cleared out the settings on an application server that had this value defined manually by gpedit.msc
 I was under the assumption that my policy would have added my accounts in addition to any preexisting ones but I was obviously wrong.
 My issue is, I have other domains to roll this setting out to with applications I'm not fully aware of.
 Is there a way for me to query servers in my domains to find any servers that have this setting defined manually in gpedit as rsop.msc doesnt show the manually defined ones.

 Now exactly 30 days after changing the host name the trust relationship between the AD and the new FS failed. I logged in as a local admin and reset the computer password using PS and everything worked again.
 How do you guys do it? How long do you wait to change host names after a migration? Did you experience something like that and will.it happen again after the next 30 days? Should I remove the machine from the AD completely and rejoin it anew if it happens again?

 At the moment I have about 500 laptops that are fully Azure AD joined and managed from Intune. In two months 500 new laptops will be ordered that I would like to use as a hybrid. So then they are Hybrid Azure AD joined with MDM Microsoft Configuration Manager/Intune.
 The new laptops come with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed.
 Normally I install all new equipment via Microsoft Configuration Manager which includes an local AD join step. The machine then enters Azure via Azure Active Directory sync. The machine then enters Intune via Cloud attach in Microsoft Configuration Manager.
 What is your method of getting machines with a pre-installed (Pro or higher) OS hybrid?

 I am currently examining the DDI market and would like to know about the existing standards and trends. Specifically, I am interested in cloud-based solutions or cloud-managed options available.Currently, our organization lacks an IPAM system, and DHCP and DNS functions are handled by the AD DCs. In addition to Infoblox, BlueCat, and EfficientIP, I am curious to know about other notable players in the market. (I would like to avoid Infoblox due to its high cost.)
 I am not looking for an overlay solution to manage DNS and DHCP on the AD DCs. Rather, I am interested in a separate solution that can remove the DNS and DHCP roles from the AD DCs entirely.
 Objective is to streamline infrastructure by separating the DHCP and DNS responsibilities from the AD DCs and consolidating them within a comprehensive DDI solution. Solution will be internal only, no public facing DNS, split-horizon, etc..
 EDIT: Looking for enterprise solution with vendor support, no DIY with Netbox and BIND/KEA

However, we have a mixed setup, with some resources hosted in the cloud (such as O365 and various Web SaaS apps) and others hosted on-premises.
 To provide some context, we currently utilize Azure AD with Business Premium License P2 for our authentication and access management. We have also adopted a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy, allowing employees to use their personal devices to access organizational resources.
 However, due to compliance requirements, employees are only allowed to access O365 applications if their device is registered with Intune and Conditional Access policies are applied.
 How can SASE help address our specific needs and challenges in this mixed setup? We are aware that SASE combines network and security capabilities into a unified cloud-based solution, but we are uncertain about its applicability to our situation.

 "I have noticed that not only SPF and DKIM, but DMARC record has been added to your domain's settings as well. Kindly note that Wix does not support DMARC records.

 We are looking at the possibility of jumping from one WLAN MSP who has been with us for a very long time to another, newer one. The older one has provided a decent quality of service but has been very expensive with respect to WLAN/LAN costs for clients in the building. The building I work at is a very large campus (over 700k sqr ft), and I am not in a position of leadership, but I'm being dragged along for observational purposes, opinions, etc. My supervisor is a finance person, and I am the only in-house IT Manager/Network Engineer person on site for these systems. I would love to bring it in-house and build out a department, as I feel it is silly to jump from one MSP, gut out all that past experience and knowledge of the building/know-how on dealing with clients, and going to a new one. I've been reading non-stop about design and management, but I was wondering if people had any advice on how to approach this, resources I should read up on, questions I should ask, etc. I won't lie, I'm nervous about this whole ordeal. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company is in the process of rolling out MS Teams to the organization. The direction is currently to deploy a MS Team to each department and then use the underlying Sharepoint site that is created automatically for that Team and customize it as their department Sharepoint site. So the department would be able to use the MS Team for Teams functions and open/link to the Sharepoint side underneath for all their departments Sharepoint needs. The Sharepoint would have permissions customized for different libraries and would also have things like Meta tags customized, etc. 
 Here is the kicker. Every event, training and MS rep I have ever spoken with has said the cardinal rule of Teams is you do not make customizations to the Sharepoint underlying a MS Team It is more of the engine underneath and you use Teams to drive the car; however, a new vendor we deal with contradicted that and said it is fine and using the underlying Sharepoint is the way to go. So I am doing somewhat of a sanity check. 
 So I am trying to crowdsource some real world examples of if/when this will cause issues. My opinion is we should be spinning up a separate Sharepoint site for each department but if I am wrong I would like to know know as well so I can grow. 
 I did some searching but couldn't find many concrete ways that utilizing and customizing the underlying Sharepoint site for a MS Team would cause issues/break things but I wanted to do my due diligence before we set out down this path if it is the wrong path.
 So I thought I would reach out to the community and see what everyone thought. 
 Cheers

 As much as this sucks, the place was pretty toxic and once I find a new job I'm sure I'll be much happier. My question is, how do I handle the question of why I'm looking for employment? I feel like telling a prospective employer that the job had a very negative impact on my mental health to the point that I started to make mistakes is probably not the best move.
 I've never been in a situation like this, so I would love to hear any advice. I actually have a phone interview later this week, but still shell shocked over the whole situation, and I'm not sure how to even talk about my current employment status.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am working on AD/Group Policy cleanup and organization and I've come across a few GPOs that are extended to our child domains.
 This is a bit new to me since the last two environments I worked out of did not follow this practice and would re-create the same GPO for each child domain.
 IE, If the parent root domain has a GPO for specific server configurations, that same GPO is re-created in each domain within the forest. A fairly manual task but leads to the creation of the GPO settings locally on the DC of that child domain.
 Now, I'm working with multiple GPOs that are extended, which is nice but I'm not entirely sure if it's ideal. I can't recall where I have read that this is bad practice and I can't narrow down why but I came across this Microsoft AD Design Considerations and Best Practices article that indicates it's a normal thing to do.
 AD: Design Considerations and Best Practices
 Based on the Microsoft article and it being semi-recently updated, I'm assuming that extending GPOs across domains is a normal practice?
 I'm more curious about the performance impact.
 On one of my child domains, I search my sysvol\child.domain\policies folder for a UniqueID of a GPO that is extended and I do not find it. This means that the computers need to reach out to the parent root domain for that policy, correct?
 While when I search for a locally created GPO UniqueID within the child.domain\policies folder, I find it obviously. 
 ​
 Any ideas or thoughts on this approach in managing GPOs on multiple domains within the same forest?
 Thanks

The windows clients received via Intune Putty and a shortcut pointing to Putty containing the IP address for the connection. Now we might have to update the IP address in that shortcut, so the plan would be to deploy a superseding app (the shortcut is deployed via script as a win32 app), but this of course will take some time, and I was thinking if there's a way to improve this kind of update. This time we can't just move the old server ip address to the new one as it will be still needed on the old one. What would be a good solution to connect all the clients to the new server without intervening on the clients?

 I’m pursuing a networking career and currently working as a field support technician (my job mostly involves tackling escalations, configuring/installing network devices and occasional server hardware installation or troubleshooting).
 I acquired my CCNA last year and I learned heaps from this certification.
 I really enjoy networking and would like to work toward getting the CCNP in the future. I understand there is a core exam (ENCOR) which needs to be passed before undertaking a concentration exam. I have very basic scripting knowledge but like idea of network automation and hoping to spark serious interest to this area.
 I may not know enough to properly make a decision on which specialty field to take for the concentration exam, but hypothetically speaking, if I were to choose the DevNet Professional for the concentration exam, would it make more sense for me to take the DEVASC exam rather than ENCOR?
 I would likely enjoy studying for the ENCOR exam since the topics appear very important to know and interesting but because I want to strengthen network programming, the DEVASC exam look nice as well.
 Btw I’m not in a rush to get CCNP certified, it’s something I would like to study slowly in addition to working full-time.
 Open to everyone’s opinion and advice!

 Then I start doing interviews and I couldn't really answer most if not all network questions. It was a eye opener and I believe it was because everything I learned was self taught, (googling, help command, reading past sailors notes, and good old trial and error). 
 My current gig title is a system/Network admin where I do software installs for ships and make sure no problems arise during the process. Not a lot of network problems pop up.

 There will be 22 videos for this course, the first is just the 6 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules with the actual course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I have multiple client users who have developed problems with network drives (DFS shares). The only thing that changed on their system was a forced W11 update (not my decision). Whenever a user opens a folder on the shared drive, it's extremely slow and crashes Explorer.exe after that, or it hangs in the "Not Responding" state. This behavior is present while in the office or with a VPN from their home network. This issue is not present for everyone, only for a handful of users.
 What I've checked and done:
  
Checked that network speeds are fine -> Everyone is getting 100+ Mbps up and down.
 
Checked that system uptime is not crazy high.
 
SFC and DISM returned no issues.
 
Cleared Explorer cache
 
Made explorer run each window as a separate process.
 
All Windows updates are installed.
 
All "Lenovo System Updates" are installed.
 
Unmapped all drives and remapped them again.
 
Made sure that Defender are not scanning the network drives.
 
 The only thing that I've found out so far is that unmapping the drives fixes Explorer's slow speeds and crashes. These users rely heavily on these drives for their everyday work (Sharepoint migration is in the works but isn't going to be done soon).
 At this point I'm kinda out of ideas, can't even find anything to try. Does anyone know any fixes for this?

 I've recently landed my first sysadmin job and while I'm super excited about this opportunity, I must admit that I'm still very green when it comes to sysadmin skills.
 Since I have a considerable commute to work, I thought it would be the perfect time to dive into some books or handbooks to download on my ebook that could help me level up my knowledge in this field.
 Whether it's a comprehensive guide to Window/Linux administration, network management, or security best practices, I'm open to any suggestions that can help me become a more competent sysadmin.
 I'm looking for resources that are beginner-friendly, providing clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. It would be great if the books cater to both Windows and Linux environments since I'll end up working with both at some stage of my career.
 Additionally, I'm interested in hearing about any online resources, blogs, or podcasts that have been helpful to you in your sysadmin journey. Any supplemental learning materials that can be consumed during my commute would be fantastic!

 I am looking for a tool to keep an inventory of computers complete with their components and ideally also with the software installed on them. Preferably a cloud solution to keep everything online.
 At this moment I found 2 good options but maybe you have something else to recommend.
 1 Option is Snipe IT (https://snipeitapp.com/)
 But that's only for inventory. I have to add computer specs manually.
 2 Option is PC Doctor Toolbox Remote (https://www.pc-doctor.com/solutions/toolbox)
 There I can add computers to an account and have everything I need at once but not as a list. I am not sure about this solution, won't it consume too much computer resources when transferring everything live?
 Thanks for your answers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm having an issue with a Windows Server 2019 VM.
 The environment:
  
Single Host VMware ESXi 6.7.0 build17499825
 4 VM Windows Server 2019
  
Only one of the four VMs started to crash, no changes were made to the VM.
 This VM has some administrative software that is used by end users.
 What is happening:
  
VM works, I can connect through RDP
 Rdp connection closes unexpectedly
 From VMware console, I can see the VM is still on but in the Sign-in screen the network icon has a big red X on it.
 When I try to enter credentials, it just keeps loading forever
 When I reboot the VM, it loads until I see the Windows logo and then it restarts automatically
 After three times it goes in recovery mode
 Tried all usual stuff from a mounted Windows Server ISO (chkdsk, sfc scannow, dism, rebuild bcd... nothing works)
 I restored the VM from backups and then I took a snapshot from VMware
 The issue is that I can't check Windows logs to find out what happens during the crash as the VM becomes unresponsive. I can only revert to the snapshot.
 When I revert to the snapshot I can work inside the VM until the crash happens again.
 It seems that before the crash there are no error logs in the Event Viewer.
 I think it could be the software installed inside this VM that triggers the crash but I cannot get proof.
  
EDIT
  
I created a local user joined to local admin group
 I was able to log in after the network crash
 I can see that under Control Panel there are no network cards, it does not matter how many network cards I add from VMware ESXi
 It seems like a driver issue, in Device Management I see a lot of unknown devices with warnings 
  
Any ideas?
 Thank you

 Now i dont know if this is a possible thing im still new to Windows Server, but assuming it is
 We get lots of password reset requests from our users and i've seen that senior system admins have said this is not a priority it can be attended to in 4 hours they are not in a hurry
 but to me it's just a few clicks and the user is back on their workstation in no time it doesn't take time
 So i've been thinking why not give users the ability to reset their own domain passwords just like google, facebook etc allows us? it should spare us time to work on other things and gets the user back to production in little time

 I see a lot of "seemingly" good positions with decent wages.
 But recently a ton of them have for applications to send it to a email....nearly all of which have a generic domain, be it Outlook, Gmail, even a few old Hotmails in there.
 ​
 The consensus I get from others in the field is that if a company is too cheap to have its own domain, then there IT budget is likely a mess.
 But I am curious how cheap they are .
 Tried googling domain costs and I get different answers, some saying .net domains are like $3-5 Canadian to buy, others say .com are $15-20 Canadian to buy with another 20 or annually.
 Others say its $500 dollars.
 I get estimates all over the map, just curious what is a standard domain name initial buy and the annual fees and see how cheap a lot of these companies recruiting are.

Earlier we had some problems with certain networks in esxi not being able to reach the gateway and rebooting the switch resolved the issue, leading me to think it was an issue with an incomplete arp table. 
 The issues from earlier have now reoccurred with networks that were not experiencing the problems earlier. Has anyone seen this before in this or other l2 switches?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 This might not be a good fit for this subreddit, but I'm curious whether any of you have heard of a Microsoft's recent offerings to protect the data stored within SQL Server databases, 'Transparent data encryption' (TDE) and 'Dynamic data masking' (DDM).
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view=sql-server-ver16
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking?view=sql-server-ver16
 My place of employment is investigating whether one of these methods might be useful to protect the data within some of our systems. 
 I'm not a DBA, I'm in an app support space, but I'm about to seek our vendor responses to either of these methods. As far as I can tell, with either method of encryption, the app is none the wiser, it's completely ignorant of the protection of the data in the same way that Windows apps are completely ignorant of the presence of BitLocker encrypting a HDD.
 As I say, this might not be applicable to this subreddit, but I'd love to know of anyone familiar with these technologies and if so, any gotchyas or caveats or horror stories.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was going through a few guides to configure FFrouting on linux, and I see that for most things one would need to manually enter the vtysh shell and input commands there. I would like to make a script for this, but how do I get my script to either enter the vtysh mode and then input commands/run commands in privileged mode without accessing the vtysh like a normal user? I haven't been able to find any method to do either from a shell script, I tried looking at how people would do it on Cisco hardware and see EEM scripts mentioned, but I don't know how to adapt them to my situation.
 I am very new to configuring routing protocols on linux and writing scripts for such purposes, sorry if this sounds like a stupid question. Thanks a bunch!
  
Edit: Found the solution! I'm really stupid for not noticing this earlier, but you can use vtysh -c and chain commands, just like you would use sh -c to chain and send commands to the POSIX shell from a different shell. Same concept, explained in the mention of its options on vtysh.
 Thanks everyone, I'll keep ansible in mind for next time!

We are in the process of removing all the servers from one of our locations and this CA is there. In the past, it seems this were used by local web apps for our organization. However, we have moved towards using another CA in another AD forest for our web apps as we are obligated to use the new CA in another forest. The only certificates that are currently active, non expired, and issued are our domain controllers. 
 Can i go through the decommissioning and not transferring certificates to other AD Forest CA without disruption (i have no access to other CA)? Will this adversely affect our domain controllers? It seems like the domain controller certificates are elements to a Windows environment implementation and would not impact Windows Domain services, etc if I decomissioned properly.

 I found out last week that my employer allows us to use our own devices for work and so I'm thinking I'll start using my Linux desktop.
 I've been wondering what terminal app those of you that drive Linux for daily work use, meaning how you organize your device connection profiles, ssh credentials, etc. Do you simply create command aliases for devices? Or do you have let's say folders for locations, that hold one file per device in that location? Do you use build-in password managers?
 I'll use Tabby as an example. It has built-in password vault, connection profiles can be organized into folders and it also has a quick-command dialog (ctrl-shift-p), just like vs-code does that quickly allows you to browse through the saved connections or (for example) save output to file, etc.
 Is there a network admin-friendly terminal in Linux or do you guys just use the standard terminal app?
 Thanks for any suggestions!

 The OT networks use several different OT protocols, but a lot of them is "pure" L2 unicast and broadcast traffic (Profinet RT looking at you). I do not want to have interference between the OT networks.
 My gut feeling is telling me VN is the way to go, but since there is a limit in the amount of VN's, I do wonder if there are some other solution?

 In real life I've jumped jobs 3 times in 16 months trying to find a company worth being at.
 Legend has it (before my time), most of the old knowledge walked out the door and the owners brought in a bunch of new people. But it's the blind leading the blind. Like they are 100 tickets behind in support cases, customers are yelling at the support e-mail boxes every day, features are delayed, and nobody can barely train me to help at all on our software (Service desk is below my role but I'd do it just because they need it) because hardly anyone knows what's going on.
 I am grateful for the job but there's also something to be said for being proud of your workplace and, that I am not. Low-key can't see how they possibly are surviving much longer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if wrong sub please direct me to the right sub for this question then
 So basically I've been thinking about this and still don't quite get it. Take a standard Windows 10 Pro OS for example. If the BIOS isn't locked by a password, you just enter it and boot into a USB drive containing a Windows Password Recovery software and bam, you got access to the admin account since now you got the password to it. If the BIOS IS locked with a password, then you take out the CMOS for a minute, put it back in, now the BIOS has been reset and you can enter it again without any password, and now rinse and repeat what I've said earlier. If Bitlocker Pre-boot PIN is enabled, then you can just crack Bitlocker with a software like John The Ripper (but that's way more complicated than just using the software itself, there's many extra steps to it and it can take hours even, but I'm not going into that coz that'd take too much time and space). So Bitlocker doesn't protect someone from knowledgeable people like IT forensics (working for the police), a BIOS password also doesn't. Windows also includes a lot of telemetry by Microsoft by default, so if you're super paranoid, then again it's not a good OS.
 I could go on and on about the many different exploits of the Windows OS. Why do companies still use Windows Enterprise as the OS on their workstations (unless we're talking servers but here I'm not; I'm talking about the workstations employees use, on their company laptops etc)

I created a PS script to copy the .exe to the machine, run install and put a validation file on the C:/folder so SCCM can figure out if it has run or not. If I manually ‘Run Script’ for that machine it will work fine. I created a package to be able to create a schedule/required install and it always prompts for elevation when the endpoint tries to run the script. If I take that same script and copy it to the endpoint and try run it, it won’t run because the script is not remote signed. I am unable to set the execution to unsigned or bypass because we have the GPO set to only allow local scripts and remote signed. I’ve tried this as a domain admin and get the same result. We also have used the PSAppDeploy scripts before with no issue and those have stopped working too. I’m quite certain that the -bypass in the script is not working now either when it tries to run. We have been running this same setup for years and have not had this issue before. There is one code sign cert on the endpoints from ‘Microsoft’ that did expire a couple weeks ago but I don’t know where that came from or how to renew it. All the certs on the SCCM server are valid (but none of them are a code sign cert). We do have a CA and I’ve tried to create a code sign cert to push but I haven’t gotten that working yet. Any ideas as to why this would all of a sudden be an issue or how I can get this working?

 I''ve recently accepted a position as senior system engineer for a big company. 
 I've been in the role for 10y+, multiple small, medium and big firms, but what've found here is singular (for me).
 In every company i worked for, we used to have some kind of sandbox envoironmanet, some old vmware vsphere or cluster or cloud of some kind available for the only purpose of checking new technology, thinkering around, stay on the edge somehow. Here there's nothing like that: all the envs must always stay in a "working" condition, and every new implementation must be approved, analized, and green lighted ON EVERY ENVIRONMENT.
 I talked to the management about that and they agreed it could be important to have a destructable and rebuiltable envs for study purposes, something agile, but also it's not prioritized: it's literally the last entry on the to-do list.
 Here it comes my question: there's some kind of literature about the importance of having this kind of things? Something that would help my needs climbing the to-do list. 
 ​
 TLDR: My bosses are totaly ok with me standing idle if there's nothing "broken to fix", I'd love to them to provide us a R&D env for playing. Looking for some literature to back my request

 Our MSP set up an autopilot policy for us, it’s been working fine but doesn’t remember the last user signed in. Users therefore have to enter their username every time they want to unlock their machine. 
 For the life of me I can’t find where this setting is inside the settings picker. I can find “Interactive Logon Do Not Display Last Signed In” but this is not enabled. 
 I’m hoping to avoid having to rebuild the entire thing just to sort this out, so hopefully somebody has an answer!

Yesterday there was a storm in my area but I disconnected the router out of electricity before the storm started. However, after the storm, my router started behaving weird. After that, only the lights of Power and WLAN were turned on. However, if I turn on my pc, and this router is connected through an ethernet with it, and I navigate to 192.168.1.1 -> status -> Refresh, the ADLS, Online and Telephone lights start turning on one by one and my Wifi works perfectly again. I tried physically restarting the router but no luck. Basically, WiFi works only when I have my pc, connected through an ethernet with my router, turned on and have the router refreshed software-wise from 192.168.1.1. Before calling the custom support, does anyone stumbled upon an issue like this and do you know what could be the cause? Could it be that my router is broken or some signaling/networking issue is present?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm trying to achieve a situation where I can generate a persistent ssh host key every boot. My (custom) initramfs is build into the kernel which is signed and securely booted with my own PK in TPM.
 In the initramfs I have build tpm2-tools, dropbear and cryptsetup alike for decryption of the main rootFS, based on TPM2 PCRs/LUKS.
 Now in case any of the PCRs change the rootfs will not mount and I will be in a situation where I'll have to ssh in and decide if I want to accept any changes in the PCR registers and add a new unseal policy to allow luks decryption which more or less works fine.
 The challenge comes that I do not store dropbear ssh host keys in the initramfs, figuring they would be readable from the signed efi kernel by taking out the bootdisk and thus would allow mitm/decryption of my ssh session while manually logging in to fix the pcr/luks decription.
 This makes it so that I get the obvious warning that the host key changed everytime I ssh into initramfs.
 My thinking is there should be a way to get, or more likely generate, a fixed host key from TPM/PCR to feed to dropbear that would not live on the boot disk.
 Anyone have any suggestions how to do this? All TPM/ssh examples I find are for the easy solution to store client keys, not the host key...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have a few weeks of international travel coming up soon, and trying to see if there is a good way for me to just bring one laptop but isolate the company stuff and my personal stuff via dual boot.
 We have a company issued Lenovo laptop, fully managed by Microsoft Intune. I also have a personal Dell laptop, I can add that to my authorized device and access company resources.
 Brought two laptops last time I traveled and it was a PITA, hence wanting to bring only 1 laptop this time around, but want to make sure I isolate the company stuff and personal stuff completely.
 Thinking about the following options:
 1. Bring company Lenovo, install a copy of Windows into a portable SSD, and boot from the portable SSD when I need to use it for personal. 
 Pro is I can disconnect the SSD physically when I don't need my personal stuff to isolate it. 
 Concern is if the company will be able to scan my personal data without me booting into the company copy of Windows(such as BIOS backdoor), and if it allow me to boot from portable SSD (this one I can test out).
 2. Bring my Dell laptop, install a copy of Windows into portable SSD and add it to authorized device to access company resources.
 Pro is I think the company control for personal device is less than corporate issued device, or at least they claim it to be.
 Concern is my personal data will be in the internal SSD and they may scan it if I boot from portable SSD and not remove the internal SSD.
 3. Bring my Dell laptop, install the company managed OS into internal drive, and install my personal OS into portable SSD.
 Probably the safer way, but more work and more PITA.
 ​
 Wonder what you think would be the best option in terms of data isolation from company IT admin perspective, appreciate any input you may have

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably my biggest issue for 3rd party tech support. When your ISP has a device that has either packet loss or high latency issues.
 Currently our ISP's device has higher than normal latency. It's a solid 70ms. I have tested pings from a few remote work buildings, my house and other tech houses. They are all the same. Every hop up to that point is low. Averaging below 20ms. But this last hop is always 70ms. It's the ISP's device in our building that connects to our firewall/router.
 Every trouble ticket we create with them goes nowhere. They say it's fine. It's fine for web traffic and stuff. But for VPN's that users run windows file copies over it sucks! Due to the Windows SMB protocol acting like trash the higher the latency goes.
 Wish I knew a way to get it through to ISP's for these kind of issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my JG962A, after unplugging the unit because the power cable was blocking a new Synology Cable Arm, upon restoring power I've recently started receiving this PoE Alarm message:
 Trap <pethPsePortOnOffNotifiction>: PSE 4, IfIndex 5, Detection Status 1 (or Status 3)
 This happens on every port that is capable of using PoE. I've tried a firmware update, factory reset, and then leaving the system unplugged for over 5 minutes.
 Is there anything else I can do to resolve the issue?
 (Edit: Clarify the two different Status # & PoE works when testing with Fluke)

We need to be able to control who logs on (aka, who contributes to the monthly bill) and have monthly data caps. There would be 10-20 users. From what I've researches we need a router or switch with a built in radius server, or need to make a stand alone radius server.... while I could cobble something together, It would be nice to have a commercial off the shelf system, that a non tech savvy melinial could manage.... anyone have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got 4x pm9a3 U.2 Drives setup in a raid 0 as a a scratch drive.
 I will run an FIO speed test and normally the first time after building the raid/booting it will get the speeds it should around 25gb/s and maintain it as long as I let the test run.
 If I stop the test and restart the exact same command it will only get speeds of 11gb/s most of the time, although sometimes I can restart the test once or twice before it will drop.
 Write speeds are always fine at around 15gb/s even when the reads are stuck at 11gb/s
 I have tested the drives individually and they seem to remain stable at around 6.5gb/s, using the same commands, regardless of how many times I start the test.
 To make things even stranger, if I only create a raid of 3 devices I get the ~18gb/s it should but then the speed will drop to 11gb/s with this as well!
 Example of raid command I am using:
 mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md/nvme --name=nvme --level=0 --raid-devices=4 /dev/nvme[1-4]n1
 Using the FIO commands from here, although I have tried tweaking them but doesn't seem to help.https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/benchmarking-pd-performance
 It has to be formatted as xfs.
 It is a dual socket 64core epyc milan system, all drives are connected to the same CPU.
 I am at a loss, any ideas?
 EDIT: Was messing with it and decided to try removing the sudo from the command, and suddenly it went to full speed again, then when I tried to run the command again, back to half speed.
 Seems anytime I change the user running the command it will work the first time, this is WAY over my head!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently posted my issue about a SQL server logs rapidly growing with no Google-able fix found. A fix was found, and it turned out that a replication to a data warehouse server was broken, and the data failures were logged and never released. We killed the replication properly and the log reduction was instant.
 The only change I made was migrating the data warehouse server to our new vmware environment (new hosts, data stores, vswitches, everything) from the prior vmware environment shared by my SQL server. 
 Would this have been my issue? That the migration broke some non TCP-IP connection? Or was this coincidental?

 I’ve been tasked with looking at ONIE switching for our 2 rack colo deployment. 
 The reason for ONIE is a management push but I am hesitant and pushing back. 
 While I can see the benefit for larger networks, I don’t know that there will be enough resources to manage it at the current moment or if it makes sense. (If it is easier than I think it to be please share your experiences) Also licensing costs. 
 This would be a 1G Fiber uplink for the first year then it would bump up to 10G on year two. 
 Ideally it would be great to future proof it to an extent. (SFP28 of SFP+ as an example.)
 EdgeCore and Dell ON series are switches that have come up frequently during my research but have not had direct experience with them in the past.

 Do you guys know about any software or tools that I can use to roll out apps, require updates, deploy network profiles, and see battery health and disk space available?
 The summer camp I work for recently acquired a fleet of laptops for some classes and activities. I told them that it would be a good idea for us to be able to manage the laptops from a central location to be able to keep an eye on all of them and keep them ready for classes.
 I have been looking at open RMM and MDM solutions and have tested MeshCentral and Fleet but I am wondering if I am looking for the wrong products.
 Ideally I am looking for a solution that we can host on-premises without requiring a subscription or license, or a service we can rent that would cost less than a few hundred dollars a year for about 100-200 devices.
 Thanks and sorry in advanced if this is the wrong forum or the post is not formatted correctly.

 I noticed that some Event ID numbers change over time, like Microsoft changes them with Windows updates for some reason?. 
 For example, 4624 LogonType 7 was used 1 year ago or so, now it is not used. So I now use 4738 to check if a user signed in entering the pw.
 I'd appreciate any insights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm currently running a more or less consumer computer at home with Hyper-V Server 2019, with two Windows VM's (one is a Domain Controller) and five Linux VM's. 
 Now.. afaik Hyper V Server is discontinued, so there will be no 2022 version. Support for it though will continue until 2019, so this should be the issue. My question tho is:
 What should be better?
  
Hyper-V Server 2019 with two Windows VM's and five Linux VM's
 Windows Server Core with Hyper-V role and two Windows VM's and five Linux VM's
 Windows Server Core with Hyper-V & Domain Controller roles, one Windows VM and five Linux VM's.
  
Any ideas?
 About the third option: I rarely encounter an issue where my Domain Controller VM isn't reachable or up, which could result in auth issues with my Hyper-V server, which is part of the domain, so both bundled together would more or less elminate the issue.
 I know there's already this thread, but this is now 3 years older and is about Windows Server with Desktop, so a lil' bit different.

 CLI with priv levels wouldn't be a solution. I need something more user friendly and easy to read. I tried playing with https GUI but i can't seem to make priv levels to work. I managed either readonly or full access. I tried to define a priv level 5 that would allow some commands, in CLI works but in GUI it doesn't.

buy a license, activate the windows in a VM in hyperv. Can run the machine for years or destroy it next month, create a new VM, fresh install, activate. As long as you are not attempting to run two VMs with same license you are good.
  
What I suspect
  
Once that VM is activated you better not "lose" that VM. The license is tight to some HW ID of that one VM, reinstalls can be done on that one machine.
  
What I fear
  
Oh you cant even use the typical win pro license in hyperv. you have to buy windows server 2016, 2019, 2022,.. special license with whatever cal sublinceses for machines/users that would connect to that machine

 I know a little about everything but I don’t know if I know enough about any particular sets of skills. I’m also scared I have learned bad habits from being solo for so long. Everything I’m looking at job-wise either seems too advanced or too entry-level. 
 Just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar spot and what the outcome was.

Netsuite is on the hard sell to sign the paper before the end of may as it’s “the best prices you will get all year”. Is that true?

 At first co-workers were doing very well in identifying the phishing tests and seemed to like the phishing alert buttons convenience. But I think the button has now become TOO convenient. 
 Most of the phish alerts I get are not phishing emails, some are emails that we are sending for employees to do cyber security training OR they are emails from things they have subscribed to, so now the button is being used like its a filter for emails they just don't want to read. 
 Should I just send out a mass email explaining the importance of using the phishing alert button correctly? Re-do training? or just be happy they are using it at all? 
 I mean, it doesn't take that much time for me to see that most of the alerts aren't important, but it does take a bit of time to go through them all to find the actual phishing attempts. 
 ​
 TLDR: Employees are spamming phishing alert button for emails they don't like, should I re-do training, send email, or care at all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, We are a UK SME who has recently been subject to a phishing campaign where the attacker has cloned our website on similar domains and sent our mailshot to attract victims. UK authorities are simply not interested at this juncture as we can not prove any financial loss, but he got pretty close recently. I keep issuing takedown request on these domains which has been relatively prompt, but the lack of interest from Instagram and UK mobile providers has been disappointing to say the least. I get the impression this will go on ad-infimum until we are significantly more proactive in our defence.
 Obviously, this is not the forum for legal advice, but from a technological perspective has anyone experience of or alternatives to Domains tools Iris Detect to monitor for lookalike domains please? Indeed any other UK specific advice would be very welcome.
 Many thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We market a software solution that runs in the cloud or on our infrastructure for most of our customers. One of our customers (very large for our situation) insists that if we want to continue the collaboration we need to migrate the service to their servers (excuses about standards and regulations, middle management and users want to expand, IT is blocking us, senior management is labile). The problem is that we are afraid for our intellectual property, because their IT department (4x bigger than our whole company) is doing similar things to what we offer to the market. 
 So I wonder, is it possible to encrypt a virtual server running on someone else's physical server in such a way that the owner of the physical server cannot bypass the protection?
 They run VMWare EXSi, we run HyperV, and my knowledge of VMware is quite limited, so a detailed explanation would be appreciated.
 Thanks!

 Most have been removed from the original company portal when it was given to me, but occasionally they forget and it's pain in the ass. In other situations, the original company no longer even exists and all the equipment leftover from a take-over is stuck in limbo.
 Are there brands that are particularly troublesome and not as safe or easy to wipe for resell?
 To name a few I have:
  
Aruba - I'm told that transferring the license from locked aruba equipment can be particularly difficult even when 
 Cisco
 Meraki - Someone mentioned the are essentially bricks?
 Ubiquiti - I'm told as long as these are fully reset it should wipe their portal information out
 Juniper
 Peplink
 Netgear
 Fortinet
 Tp-Link
  
I might be missing some others.

I am being told by Nokia that the 7360's will only allow the proxy to be configured to remove the SSM source that the settop STB sends to the OLT, and change the IGMP joins to *,G joins, and therefore we must do IGMP translations on the edge routers to get them back to SSM IGMP joins, and that is the standard for NOKIA and all ISP do it that way.
 Anyone doing this today and not doing it this way, or doing it this way?

 So in Q1 this stupid OKR was set to "reduce running costs by 10% by the end of the year" by a management who doesn’t have any idea how things work in IT. They complain that we have too many subscriptions, claiming that surely there are a few that aren't essential, without even knowing which tool does what. At the end of the day, it's more about workplace politics than facing the reality so we had to keep that OKR and "see what we can do." (rolling_eyes)

Recently, Apple and Samsung have started using HEIC as a default format, and it's driving our claims folks nuts since there's no easy way to open them without the 99 cent converter (which, since it's needed to be purchased from the windows store per user account, has been a fairly unattractive option). 
 The only work around we've found so far is providing the few folks who handle the incoming images with a copy of GIMP, but it's far from an elegant solution when there's a couple dozen images needing to be converted one at a time. In addition, we're starting to see the format pop up more often with remote folks sending in photos of forms with PII on them, so online converters are completely out of the question. 
 Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant or consented to by any user in the tenant. You may have sent your authentication request to the wrong tenant. 
 I've tried a combination of looking on CodeTwos troubleshooting forums and install guides and most of them are for installing the paid software and creating an app registration in Azure. Even if I create an app registration in azure for CodeTwo and assign the permissions the guide says, I don't see a way to connect that app registration to code two since registering an app automatically generates an app ID that's different from the one displayed in that error message with no way to change it. 
 My question is, how am I supposed to register an application in Azure that isn't in the Azure App Library when I can't assign the applications identifier to that registration, as well as not being able to change the identifier of the application because I didn't make it. (All the guides on how to change an app ID seem to be to the tune of "adjust it in the code") 
 I was looking into it potentially being a misconfigured consent issue, since we don't get the "The app needs the following permissions" and "Consent on behalf of your organization page", but I'm not exactly clear on how to enable that either. 
 Any help from the hivemind is greatly appreciated.

 The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the server olddc$. The target name used was cifs/OLDDC.TCH.local. This indicates that the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client. This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Ensure that the target SPN is only registered on the account used by the server. This error can also happen if the target service account password is different than what is configured on the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for that target service. Ensure that the service on the server and the KDC are both configured to use the same password. If the server name is not fully qualified, and the target domain (.LOCAL) is different from the client domain (.LOCAL), check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains, or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server.

After the interviews, was told they want to make me an offer and we negotiated a salary that we both agreed too. Was told almost two weeks ago that everything looked good and they would work on getting an official offer letter out.
 Since then, no offer letter has been sent. I've emailed both the IT and Hiring manager and have gotten no response. Fearing the worst.
 Anyone else have something similar happen to them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR
 I work as an online developer for a large tech company (+20k employees worldwide).
 As a basically Windows-only shop, how difficult is it for a company like this to allow and authorize Linux dev machines?
 I imagine there are security considerations (patching/updates) and other stuff. Is it reasonable that they give us a "hard no" on this request?
 Background (if you want more details):
 Many of us prefer to work in a native Linux environment, but this is not authorized by our company. Since pretty much have free reign over our dev machines, some of us have installed Linux in dual boot. Others use a Linux bootable USB.
 These actions aren't authorized by IT, but so far, our local IT guys have been sympathetic and have adopted a "don't ask, don't tell" kind of attitude, which works for us.
 Many devs don't want to risk it, and use WSL. Most complain about it all day (stability, perf, etc..)
 We'd like to stop working in the shadows and get official authorization from our IT dept. We're wondering if they're just "lazy/inept", or if supporting Linux in a large company like this is prohibitively complex/expensive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upfront - I'm underwhelmed by antivirus and EDR providers. Perhaps I'm suffering from working in a small company (just 100 endpoints), so maybe the products are better than my experiences so far.
 We are with Cybereason, currently on NGAV but due to replace with EDR in September. The support has been awful. For example, Cybereason is currently detecting itself (coreminion.dll) as being Malware (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/). But only on one machine. I've seen other examples of legit software flagged on a handful of our endpoints, but not on most. It's just so wildly inconsistent, despite everything being in the same policy group, updated, and so on.
 Crowdstrike - looked promising, but awful sales experience. I've been blunt about how our purchasing decisions are made (we have an annual budget - if it isn't in that, it's not happening) and given windows when it's good to speak (i.e. two months before I confirm my budget for next year!). This doesn't stop me being harassed by calls and emails, including one rather embarrassing "My manager said I'm in trouble for giving you this price, but I can honour it if you buy now!" call.
 Watchguard - support was absolutely appalling, and their Panda EDR client trashed our Linux laptops.
 So, two questions:
  
Have I just been unfortunate with Cybereason - are those on the EDR or MDR solution finding a more pleasant time. What is your feedback?
 Are AV providers just shitty, or is it because we're such a small account? Would we be better using a MSSP? I'm wary of MSSPs because I've worked for a few MSPs who have tried their hand at security, and I'd not trust them anywhere near our small estate.
  
I'd be grateful for thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never understood how this could be possible, maybe you folks have some ideas. It's not an issue at present but a problem I never got an answer to. We would see this usually when a specific firewall model was about to fail and starts acting buggy and shortly after totally dead (needing reboots and dropping connections the weeks leading up to failure sort of thing). Seen the exact scenario at least 3 times with this hardware.
 Anyhow when the FW would have it's issues devices on the LAN would also stop working bringing, basically the entire switch is affected for locally hosted programs that typically continue to work when internet is down otherwise. We replace the FW with a new model all is fine of course, but it's alwaysbleft me confused.
 My question though is how is the L3 firewall/gateway managing to screw up a dumb switch for L2 communication? I understand while it's having issues internet may not work but this phenomenon feels like it violates everything I learned about the OSI model?? 
 I can only think something with ARP getting messed up or basically FW overloading the switch and basically DoS it? 
 Simple flat layout. Single LAN/24, dumb switch, no VLANs, nothing crazy configuration-wise

 Have any of you smart folks out there deployed these CBS350 switches from Cisco?
 I've recently deployed a 2x CBS350-48FP-4X stack and the CPU is pinned at 100% during production hours. There's a 2x CBS350-24FP-4X stack in the same location with an almost identical config and that thing is fine.
 I usually work with IOS derived devices but this seems to be an "ROS" device and the usual 'show process cpu sorted' etc commands don't exist.
 This problem exists on 3.2 and 3.3 (the latest as of writing this) firmwares.
 The stack is based in a hub office and the config isn't complicated, it has 9 APs, 2 firewalls in HA, 2 routers in HA, a couple of door entry controllers, a cctv dvr, a couple of ACLs and 1 static route. There are no cameras plugged into …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am struggling a bit to find the fastest way to delete mail from people's mailboxes when there is a security incident. For the past two weeks we have had multiple comprised users falling for phishing. We have monthly simulations, have phishing set to aggressive block in M365, various endpoint lockdowns, external header flagging, external banner flagging, the MS setting that says, "you don't regular get mail from this person, etc." We also block many top level domains in DNS filter, block new domain, etc. If anything the complaints from the execs and users are "too much email security."
 Despite all this, stuff comes through. M365 will alert us but unless it is in quarantine, I can't find a way to easily delete it for box that it exists in. What 'sometimes' works is
 ​
  
Connect-ExchangeOnline
  
Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName <your UPN> * New-ComplianceSearch -name "suspicious emails" -ExchangeLocation all -ContentMatchQuery 'subject:"suspicious"' * Start-ComplianceSearch “suspicious emails” * New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName “suspicious emails” -purge -purgetype SoftDelete/HardDelete
 This is cumbersome and does not always complete due to powershell errors and/or our team rushing to get it done fast. Last night it would not accept the 'purge' argument for reasons I did not determine. I also need to set the security to "winrm basic" to run this and then change it back again when done.
 reference https://www.codetwo.com/admins-blog/new-compliancesearch-new-version-of-search-mailbox/
 I am also trying to delete from Trace \ go hunt for this message" \ "advanced hunting" and though I find the mail and take action to delete it, it does not appear to delete.
 What I am looking for is to the fastest way, ideally through the GUI, to locate all mails from a sender and /or subject and delete.
 Thx!

 I’m looking to find a good solution for storing secure documents. For clarification, these are not physical documents. These are things like word docs that have all of our server configuration information; data center documents with our network diagrams, firewall info, etc.; and even documents where we keep things like vendor account information. 
 I know with 365 we can set document restrictions, but that just doesn’t feel like enough. So, what are you all using to store these sensitive documents in a place that can be set up with access lists for team members? Any and all suggestions welcome at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Been struggling lately with a project. Everything is behind NDA with too small group knowing about it and it's starts to affect the performance. There is just too much to do in a small time window, that I'm getting the feeling that we have to either:
 a) attain more people to help on project
 b) postpone some aspects for later implementation, but that would be seen as bad plannig on my end 
 but..
 a) C-level don't want to involve any more people. Straight up no, just drop the topic.
 b) Deadline is set. There is some serious $$ involved and I'm sure they would rather fail partly and fix it after the deadline.. but that would be my problem to fix later on , while they will put the blame one someone else. 
 Another idea was to persuade most of project members to my ideas, but that takes time, which is running out. My question is how do you find a workaround in those situations and go with how you propose? 
 P.S. and please, no "CY@/leave as see what they do", cause in the end, when the milk was already spilled and you get the blame or bad looks it's already too late, since there seems to be distrust whether you are capable of working on bigger projects..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m considering changing part of my approach to how I manage filtering of DNS and web requests. 
 I currently have EDR software installed on all workstations and DNS filtering software in place, however, I still see phishing from the plethora of new TLD’s. In particular, the whole .zip and .mov TLD debacle got me thinking.
 Don’t get me wrong, the spam filters GENERALLY catch the phishing, but they’re not 100% and I really like defense in depth.
 I’d like to change to whitelisting TLD’s instead of blacklisting. Obvious I’d need the usual suspects like .com, .gov, .mil, national domain’s etc. I’d probably also add some of the newer ones that actually see some legit traffic like .museum. 
 Has anyone done this? What lessons did you learn and what pitfalls should I watch out for?
 Thanks!

Any reason why this is happening? Is it on the server end? Or something is wrong with the client.

 It's the same thing with exporting a VM. Anything on the mountpoint is slow. Anything on a mapped drive is really fast and it's tested on different hosts in different sites. 
 It's the same situation on a cluster in a different site and MPIO is configured as per the SAN vendor's documentation.

 I also have a massive wealth of knowledge in Hardware both Consumer and Professional (Servers, Blade Servers etc.) 
 As for trying to find out about requirements internally I don't think I'm in a position to ask about that considering how new I am.

A previous admin has changed all the passwords and unfortunately didn't sync them correctly, which means all the passwords weren't saved. I have found a video on YouTube where someone can reset passwords by opening a case and switching off a button on motherboard of a printer. I don't really know if that can work but I suppose so. Any other ideas would be appreciated, because a technician wants 200 dollar pro printer and we don't have that much money. Thank you all

 Yea sure. I never logged on to it as i thought it was actually managed (this was my mistake)
 Since it was 2012r2 (we are in the process of upgrading) i logged on today with my admin credentials... and they don't work. I check the documentation and find out that there is a password. 
 Obviously .\administrator.
 Turns out:
 The server is not joined to the domain, no windows license configured, just one dns, local administrator, no antivirus, UAC disabled, no antivirus, last windows patch january 2020, anydesk installed.
 A poster for worst practice.

 Q1. Colleague access 365 services from personal devices, we control access by in tune MEM. With additional policy’s around OS levels. Colleagues require to authenticate one a week with MFA. Would it be fair in saying on the day of the audit only devices that have accessed info on that week would be under scope? If so what testing do they actually under go. We allow iOS, andriod and windows devices to access info this way. 
 Q2. The requirements are that os levels be up todate, but looking more in to requirements is it fair to say that andriod 11 would be complaint Os as this is still recieving support ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm looking for some sort of routing-protocol or other function/mechanic that can solve my following problem:
 I have an HQ and a side-branch (SB). They are connected via EtherLink (~ 200km distance).
 Basically all VLANS are L2 transparent connected between both sides, giving me the same IP Address-space, WiFi-Networks, etc... over both locations.
 All inter-VLAN Routing takes place on the Core-Switch at HQ. Internet Connection is also only at HQ. Any connections to the internet from SB goes through HQ.
 In the event that the EtherLink goes down, Inter-VLAN routing at SB is not possible anymore. How can I make Inter-VLAN routing possible at the Core-Switch at SB in the case that the EtherLink to HQ goes down? Internet Connectivity is not a requirement in this case.
 €dit: I should mention that I'm using a HPE 10504 as the Core@HQ and a HPE FlexFabric 5940 as Core@SB. Other switches on both sides are all HPE. Mostly 5510 and 5130.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I hope I can have help around my question as I am fighting on for days. Forgive me my broken English also.
 Due to organizational matter, In my company we need to see/list in udadmin into our license server only the devices connected, not the users. Surfing for days around the net I understand that it probably depends on the License Type and on how are installed.
 The strange thing is that a couple of those device we have are already listed like this and they connect/show as device (thin clients) without listing the username as well. For the rest we use also windows laptops as well so we have a mix. We own a Citrix On-Prem server where the employees connect to their desktop via ICA/Receiver.
 Is there a way to re-install the license and associate it per device and not per user on the physical machine? Any hints? Citrix Inc. seems like to be very conservative and limited about it, and I couldn’t find much around the net.
 Thank you! 😊

 Let’s say replacing the system is not an option and running a new cable is not an option, what are some ways I can extend the wireless network? The solution doesn’t have to be super cheap but would want to keep it under 500/600. 
 Are there any decent Wi-Fi extenders or something out there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planning network config for a small company - setting up one office in the UK and one in India, will have 1-2 APs at each for now (max 5-6 users at each). No on-prem servers, everything in the cloud. 1 Gbps symmetric fiber at both sites.
 Easy management is key, as I will usually be thousands of miles away from either office (and overseeing IT is maybe 5% of my job) - so a single pane of glass for routers/FWs/APs would be great if possible.
 Somewhat budget conscious - would be great to avoid hefty subscription costs if possible.
 Among prosumer-ish stuff, I don't trust Ubiquiti beyond their APs, and TP-Link Omada likely won't be acceptable in this particular application.
 Thoughts on Engenius, which seems to have a single pane cloud solution with their ESG510 gateway + APs?
 Or I guess could give up the single pane and do, say, Aruba InstantOn for APs and something else for FWs (maybe Fortinet FortiGate 60F/70F?). Any other reasonable FW options?
 Any other ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a former DevOps guy, and bought some commercial real estate. Looking to setup wifi and network across a 25k SF multi-tenant building. Cinderblock walls that are concrete filled, so signal doesn't travel well between units. Looking for suggestions on best "cheap used enterprise" hardware to look at. Don't have much experience with Cisco, Aruba, Arista, etc. Read dozens of threads and can't tell whats legit and what's a Ford vs Chevy thing. Tried using 30 Google WiFi routers in topology described below and it failed horribly. Tenants are mom and pop so just needing basic wifi across the building plus extensive security system cause building is in the ghetto. 
 Cat6 to each unit from roof, forming wired backbone of one hard-wired AP per unit into 2-3 48 port POE switches. Add more wireless APs in each unit to form a hybrid mesh network without have to run more Cat6 everywhere. Wired backbone would also contain dozens of POE security cameras. Wired backbone would have a few switches spread geographically aross the building (left, right, center) and all connected by SPF uplinks.
 I want to avoid licensing fees and recurring costs. Ideally I can buy cheap enterprise hardware on ebay/offerup, link it all up, write a script or two for configuration (or click some buttons on a web portal) and be done. If need to expand, buy more of the same used gear then plug and play to expand the network. Don't want to worry about getting bricked out because a vendor discontinues some cloud product or because my license expired or I didn't buy from approved vendors. Also confused on the internal vs external wireless controller -- seems like sometimes thay is part of the AP and other times it is seperate?
 What brands/models do you all recommend and why? Give me a shopping list that can get it done as cheap, easy and robust as possible. I like the idea of buying used in bulk and then developing a scalable I can replicate on any future building I buy.

 One vendor has some shady AF tactics by sending us depreciation notices for competitors, for products we're even evaluating. There's some other mud slinging shenanigans that are just underhanded and not professional.
 The second doesn't meet several of our core criteria, so they're already disqualified, but have the best price. 
 The third bone head is borderline harassing my staff calling and texting several times a day. We're a slow decision making process because of the cost, and won't let up. Then he drops the bombshell that he's desperate to make the sale because he'll lose his job if he doesn't close with us.
 Now I'm left with an ethics problem that may disqualify this vendor. And the swarmy sales guy makes me want to ditch the first. Ugh... I don't ever remember purchasing being this hard. 
 Now what do I do?

 Thought I could just ask my friend who also has ssh access to the server, turns out he didn't even setup an ssh-key even tho I told him to do so before I closed off password authentication.
 none of the oracle cloud control panel's console shell or run command option were working for some reason
 I freakin make a recovery instance, detached the boot volume of the broken server, attached it to the recovery instance, fixed the config, and then re-attached the boot volume where it belonged
 It may not sound like much but I'm just 17 and have no professional courses or certificates when it comes to oracle cloud (or any other cloud) and sysadmin.
 I feel so confident on my sysadmin skills.
 After this I don't feel like a kiddo when I say that I'm a decent sysadmin.

 So here is a situation, after 3 years of different admins doing shit they didn't document, it is my turn to have fun. I recently got promoted from help desk, because 2 admins left.
 And here comes the fun part.
 All Managers are in DA group. There is a Local Admin policy but it is linked to whole domain. Admin rights are given using restricted groups policy.
 My plan to fix this mess is to create 3 groups. Workstation admins, Developers, Server admins. Also 3 policies one to link to workstations OU, second also to workstations (but restrict it to apply only to developers Desktops) and third to server OU.
 I will create separate accounts for administration and add them to groups.
 Workstation admins will be 2 of our helpdesk guys, I will also give them righs to add PC to domain.
 Developers will be all Developers (don't ask me why, they cry to the management if they don't get admin rights. And they love them more since they make money)
 Server admins will be me, 1 colleague and CEO
 And I will leave only Domain Administrator in DA group and restrict access to all machines except Domain Controllers.
 First question is do you think that this plan is good? Do you have any other advice?
 Second question is, since a lot of members of DA group and Local Admin group are already logged in to some Workstations and Servers, and they won't lose admin access on those machines untill I restart them. What is a best way to remove them without reboot, but also apply new policies?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine a situation where one is setting up a small network. There is to be some sort of physical server on the network with a VM running a webserver or mailserver or something that is exposed to the WAN. Obviously one should set up a firewall in this case. The physical server still has much memory and CPU time which is unused.
 As far is security is concerned, which one is better: using a dedicated physical firewall machine or adding a software-defined virtal firewall? Which is standard practice? In general, are security-oriented network services best kept physical for more guaranteed compartmentalization or best integrated into the SDN for simplicity (or something else)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seeing the other topic about emails reminded me of this happening last week. 
 User tells me an email to a government agency never made it there in time, and that it is going to cost us funding money. They want me to go look in the system and see if it ever left Exchange. They had sent it the week before, closed up shop and went on vacation.
 Check Exchange, and sure enough it did not go through on the day in question, but on the day they called me. So it looks like it didn't leave the mailbox, went into outgoing, they prematurely closed up the machine before it sent and went home. I explain this to them, and they tell me that because they use a Mac, and heard the "Swoosh" sound, they knew it sent.
 Wrong. I have the proof that it didn't send. Here's the proof.
 Not good enough, they had me expand the parameters, check the system again, so I did. I humored them. It's then that I notice that the email had a second recipient: The sender.
 "Did you CC yourself in the email as well?"
 "Yes Mikash33, I did."
 "I see. Did you receive the email before today?"
 "No, I didn't."
 "OK, so think about that for a moment; You sent this very important email to them and yourself, didn't get your copy, and didn't think to check if it sent until a week later?"
 Silence on the phone. Checks watch, 10 seconds go by before I bust out: "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

 Imported with no errors. When I search for the name or IP using the search tool, it returns no entries. If I try to then manually add the name or IP, it errors telling me it exists already. If I try to add the name to an existing group object - it is not available to select. 
 I delete the entry and can manually add the Name and IP and everything works fine. CSV import would be great for 50 and 60 new names and IP's rather than the manual GUI host by host.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technology stack for quick reference, it is an industrial network environment:
 Serial Network (20 Modbus slaves daisy-chained on RS-485) > Modbus RTU to TCP Converter (Port 502, static IP assignment) > Unmanaged OT Network Switch, /23 subnet with about 200 devices total, mostly Gigabit uplinks.
 After several years of happy and uninterrupted operation (it is a Datacenter), the Serial devices being Mastered by the converter had lost communications all at the same time. Initially, a soft reset of the device had re-established serial as well as TCP communications.
 Within hours, all of the serial devices lost communications again. Several different configuration changes were tried to no affect. A TCP/RTU testing utility was unsuccessful in establishing communications to the slaves via the Converter (failed on handshake), but the Web UI for the converters was still accessible. Soft reset did not help this time.
 Ended up changing the statically assigned IP configured on the Converter to a different address, same port (502), on the same subnet. Comms started working, everything stabilized.
 It is still working but I don't understand why.

 I myself watched as the company I wrapped up my long career up with, a company with billion dollar annual profits, slowly but very steadily chip away at every benefit from healthcare to office conditions over the last several years. Looking back I was glad to have been there "during the good times" and was sad to see newer, younger coworkers not even have the frame of reference to understand just how much they were getting screwed and commoditized despite not actually being commodities. 
 In hindsight some of the primary reasons the company got away with it was their "thousand small cuts over time" approach, and the total failure of employees, especially the older and more senior ones, to collectively push back in an organized fashion. I'm not saying to Unionize (and I'm not saying not to, either), but it's clear that todays Fortune 500 companies operate under the exploit and push until something breaks model of staffing and operations, just as they do with most everything else. And if you're quiet and kill yourself to make moving that goalpost successful for the company, then it will probably be at your expense.

 I've come across a problem with our D-Link DGS-3120-48TC switches. We have three stacked together and I had set one port to a VLAN (L2 Features -> VLAN -> 802.1Q VLAN Settings) and also enabled the guest VLAN on that port as well (Security -> 802.1X -> Guest VLAN Settings), so that a device that doesn't get authenticated by 802.1X, it automatically gets put into the guest VLAN. 
 Now, I removed the guest VLAN setting and wanted to configure the same port to a new VLAN while also removing it from the first VLAN. This, however, shows the error "The guest VLAN member port cannot be configured." This only happens when trying to assign it to VLAN 1. Every other VLAN works, but I need the PC attached in VLAN 1 x)
 Has anyone stumbled upon this as well and can lead me in the right direction?

 I am working with a customer and am having an issue where devices are requiring a reboot in order to register back online intermittently. The devices are PoE + and require 30Watts to each one but that does not appear to be the problem as the customer sent back information that leads me to believe that cant be the issues (switches are definitely not overloaded). Below is the switch info along with the commands they are pushing to each port for the device before we install them.
 Cisco enterprise 3850 switches
 description **PA System**
 switchport access vlan 5
 switchport mode access
 no logging event link-status
 no snmp trap link-status
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
 I am by no means a network guy but could a standard QoS setting be causing a problem here? These are PA notification devices so they need to be set up to take priority over any other devices on the network incase of emergency. Could there be some kind of shut down due to inactivity possibly? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

New POS system at a remote location, network blamed for equipment going down for several days. Turns out to be a licensing renewal issue on their end. No apologies for their mistake. It ended up happening AGAIN at another location later.
 MDM system stops allowing certain IT staff to enroll mobile devices properly. "Must be something you did on your end" - ends up being a change they made on their end.
 SSO for a third-party app stops working randomly one night - "Must be a network issue on your end" - spend hours trying to troubleshoot and nothing our end changed, turns out to be a bad coding change on their end.
 Outlook add-in for large CRM stops working for certain employees, but not others. "It's your Outlook version" - prove that it isn't by having a user with access to all orgs try all in the same instance of Outlook. This is still a pending issue and can't get them to accept responsibility.
  
I know I'm preaching to the choir here but I'm so sick of it. Wasting all kinds of time trying to prove to first level support dumbasses that read scripts all day to let me talk to someone who knows what the hell they're talking about. Even escalating just leads to more dumbasses that won't accept responsibility for issues.

The only problem is the company that makes the software wants us to run very old versions of Adobe Reader because of compatibility with their product. I don't know if it's laziness on their end but not being able to update our PDF software is a risk on our end. I know the normal response is usually get another vendor, but trust me when I tell you this is not an option.
 I'm worried about PDF attachments that come through email. I am really at a loss how to handle this. Keep AR at older versions but protect against email attachments. Just saying it makes me feel stupid. I know the answer is "you want to keep a vulnerable version of AR but you want to security as well?" I hear you. I'm just looking for possible solutions right now. How would you guys handle this email issue? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not a cryptography expert, nor am I a sysadmin. But I'm playing around with PKI (mostly mostly client auth/sign), but I think a relatable example that most sysadmins will get is PKI use for S/MIME.
 Yes, you can pay $50/email address to some certificate authority, but many will also roll out their own PKI. It all depends on the use case of course, do you just need non-repudiation for internal use, or do you want outside recipients to verify emails.
 But it's 2023. Let's Encrypt lets you get DV certificates for free, but those certificates only support TLS server/client authentication EKUs.
 Why can't we have free validated S/MIME certificates (and other types of certificates)?
 Why can't we have our own CA for a domain, and have our "local root" signed by a "real" CA just like any other intermediate CA, so we can generate our own certificates that work on our own domains? Servers would need to also serve intermediate certificates that are under our control so the chain can be fully built since those links are missing in browser/computer root stores, but that's just a few extra bytes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've a 4 mikrotik CRS317-1G-16S+ setup, configured as two pairs of switches.
 Each pair has MLAG configured between them and hardware nodes are connected to one port in each via LACP. This is replicated with the second pair in another rack and then the two pairs have a 4 line LACP bond to connect them. All of this is a standalone isolated network.
 My hope for this was a complete redundancy with zero downtime, as our use case is really sensitive to that and any network downtime can cause major headaches.
 Overall this solution seems to work reasonably well and survives reboot of up to 2 devices (one of each pair) at the same time. There however often are small network down times of 1-4 seconds when one device goes down or reconnects after getting back up.
 Is this normal? I've not been able to experience these technologies on one of the more expensive brand devices, so I can't compare, but I'd generally assume bonds are meant to mitigate perceivable network down times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A client has 3 licenses of a software which are shared on 5 computers. According to the license it is ok to share those licenses (up to 2 users per each license), however cannot be used simultaneously.
 Obviously the users forget to close the software one they are finished and just leave it running in the background, thus blocking others who need to launch it on their computers.
 Is there a way to detect when a process has been idle for more than 15 minutes, so that we can then run a command to kill the process from memory?
 I tried using PowerShell but it seems that there is no property which gives how long the process has been idle.
 Maybe someone out there knows of a software that can reliably monitor a specified process for this type of scenario.
 Thanks!

 The errors we are getting before it hangs is: ID 129 - vhdmp and ID 51 - disk
 We have implemented the REFS fixes that Microsoft recommends to no avail.
 Nothing have been changed on the server since this error started to occur (it have been running for approx. 3 months)
 Some info about the server: Windows Server 2022 - updated to latest Microsoft SQL 2022 - updated to latest DPM 2022 - updated to latest.
 The DPM disk is 40TB and is running through Think system raid 9350 card.
 Anyone that can point me in the right direction?

 Fortinet 60f or 80F is what I've been leaning more towards. What are you thoughts? Price is a main concern for owners, but quality is most important in terms of up time. This will be self administered and i'm a techy guy but we're not doing anything fancy on the network.
 Just lots of traffic of all kinds, nothing huge data file wise, just mainly lost of secure web traffic for our cloud hosted CRM/ERP/ETC.
 Will need to add about 4-6 Wireless AP's throughout the building so also something that has a Wireless AP solution would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys
 I have a strange behavior with a system I added to my Windows Server Hyper-V Failover Cluster in Server 2022.
 The servers have nearly the same configuration - the CPUs are a Intel Xeon Gold and Intel Xeon Silver:
 Cluster with Server 1 and Server 2 (the new Server).
 Behavior not working:
  
VM is on Server1 and I want to Live Migrate to Server 2
 not working, because of "processor specific features" - but the CPU compatibility mode from the VM is activated
  
Behavior working:
  
If I shutdown the VM and do a fast failover from Server 1 to Server 2 it's working and I can start and work with the VM
 
If I do then a failover from Server 2 to Server 1 it's working
 
A switch back from Server 1 to Server 2 is working as well
 
When the VM is on Server 2 I can restart and shutdown the VM and after starting again I'm able to live migrate to Server 1
 
 At this point it's not working anymore:
  
When I shutdown or restart the VM on Server 1, I'm not able to do a failover to Server 2 (see behavior not working - processor specific features)
  
Server1 and Server2 have the same Hyper-V Manager settings and I already tried with a new, from scratch, installed Windows VM.
 Where is the difference? Why is the normal failover working as long as the machine is moved in shutdown state and failovered while it's running until it's shutdown/restart on a different server (Server 1).
 I found something about Bios/Driver differences but since both servers are not equal, I have differences.

We use a mix of VMware and Nutanix AHV which means Cohesity is out of the mix due to lack of full support for AHV.

 We already have Veeam so we know what that offers.
 Large Hospital and have about 1000 VMs with 150 Physical - more to be onboarded soon. Need on-site and cloud storage for backup copies.

The situation is that the client has a piece of software that is mission critical to be online from 10am-10pm, and the license key is currently a parallel key that is plugged into a parallel pci card in their current system. I only have a few days on site and need to find a workaround, I have that pcie x4 slot and USB basically are my only options to figure something out. Our newer stuff uses USB license keys and we can convert this one but it wouldn't get done fast enough. Lastly I am in Anaheim so I have access to all of Anaheim and LA which may help my odds finding some adapter card or something locally thanks everyone.

 I'm wondering if anyone has tested a method to perform a remote wipe, as we've spent a lot of time on the issue and have had little luck.
 We've been using Graph API calls, like the one below, experimenting with different commands and payloads. For 90% of our test cases, we've had the same result: the system is partially wiped, with most of the data left on the device, and after reboots, the user is presented with a login to the Admin account, not OOBE.
 We've tried many variations of the API call and have even checked the API calls from the Intune portal using dev tools, but all our efforts have produced the same, unsatisfactory result. Our problem seems to apply only to Windows 10 devices. A few tested Windows 11 devices were wiped successfully.
 calls used: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices/XXXXXX/cleanWindowsDevice or /Wipe with different payloads etc. Also non-beta calls fails.

 After extensive trial & error, I'm starting to suspect intermittent internetconnection.Speedtest is pretty fast, ping is ok, but when in teams-meeting we have also experienced small hickups and even disconnects. So I'm thinking her wired connection is kind of bad quality, drops the connection, hence device goes over to wifi, and back, and back, and back. Resulting in Outlook to start flipping.
 Any particular application where I can the user have to run a log for a few days and see what's happening on her machine?

 I already made my first post with a question about MS Defender for Endpoint about a month ago, since I have to do a little Presentation about it. 
 I am facing a new problem, which I can't solve on my own (at least it looks like that). But now to my problem: 
 I want to know each possible column which I can get on Vuln. like CVE-ID, Description and so on. I was able to open a trial account with my student email and it works fine for MS Defender for Endpoint and Intune, but I can't get access with the same acc to PowerBi and to Azure. I used an other Account to get Azure (and tried to set up some test vm´s), but I am not able to onboard them into MS Defender for VM. 
 What do I need ? 
 I got a report example about some Vuln. which I can't reproduce with just using MS Endpoint and MS for Cloud and I would need a report with a few different (test) vulnerabilities, that are active, closed or in remediation with ALL possible columns. I tried every report feature in the application itself and I would like to know if there are more columns possible if I for example use the PowerBi Interface ? Its really hard, since the Documentation is not really precise in a lot of things like states etc.
 Sorry for my not very accurate English ... and also, if I did not understand sth. right - I am new in this field and not very experienced. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, just looking into an issue a client noticed on their RD environment and I cannot figure out what's happened.
 Basically 1 user has taken up 3 of the RD licenses (CAL's) If you open RD licensing manager you can see the licenses active on an individual user bases, but then 1 user has 3 assigned to himself. The only thing that stands out as odd to me is it shows slightly different uppercase/lowercase characters for each of the entry's. for example:
 CompanyDomain\joe.blogs - Issued on 18th may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.Blogs - Issued on 15 may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.blogs - Issued on 03 may 2023 - Active
 Notice each entry has different capital letters. this is a replica of how it shows in RD Licensing manager 
 1st entry has no capitals
 2nd entry has capitals on both names
 3rd entry has 1 capital on the first name and all lowercase second name. 
 They have 20 licenses in total, all active but 3 are assigned to this 1 guy
 user is only logged into 1 server at the moment of 3 RDS servers. RDBroker shows this is also the case.
 I can see in our RMM system they have more than 1 workstation. PC in office and laptop for remote working. Is it possible they've been given multiple licenses because they may have connected in from multiple workstations at some point? doesn't explain why he's got 3 when he only has 2 workstations if that were the case.

 Just wanted to hear from anyone with a similar experience. Was handed a laptop with my new role last October to which it's a 7 year old lenovo with Windows home. November last year even after an SSD and ram upgrade to 8GB (from 4) still struggling with cpu. I've had to turn off noise filtering a little while ago in teams to make it usable during long meetings. I have an email trail since November asking for a new laptop screen and dock stating the reasons and its been stalled ever since, every meeting catchup with manager there's a different excuse or blame on the further delayed merger talks. Latest is I've got a complaint on background noise in meetings which I argued I can't switch on teams noise filtering due to ongoing cpu usage. Told to move my office at home or tell my family to be more quiet. I'm at my wits end and looking for a new role as my boss is a cow. Today's advice from manager was to create a work profile on my personal laptop, as we all need to make personal sacrifices. Kind on makes me think I should go back to an MSP, respected in my last few. Maybe I should invoice them for use of my laptop?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week a department put in an incident saying an email was not delivered and because of that it cost the company a substantial amount of money and they are saying the email system messed up. The email SME did his research- it was Exchange- no external email. Someone internally email an attachment to a DL and none of those people in the DL claimed they received it, but mail flow and Exchange Reporter said they did. We were able to show who sent the message and when it was received by all the people in the DL which are internal as well.
 Fast forward to today and that department is sticking to it’s guns that the company email system messed up and the email just “disappeared”
 Really?! FFS are users this dumb? Not one but FOUR in the DL? What more do you want I thought? I was told by my leadership to find hard proof the message was there. So I did.
 I gave my adm account access to the mailboxes and logged into each one and found the message. The person causing the most stink- I found the message in their recover deleted items and it had been deleted four minutes after it was received.
 Now the department is blaming us because the file doesn’t have the right content- sorry that is not even remotely the IT department’s responsibility- please find another way to spin it how you f**ked up and don’t blame IT!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say your organization is multi-cloud, or in a single cloud provider with considerations to go multi-cloud.
 What are your present day criteria to determine where you'll place a new workload? For example:
  
Which cloud provider and which region? What are the metrics or drivers that will motivate you to consider more than one provider? Or a new region within the same provider?
 Is the proverbial "we always want the cheapest" criterion still dominant in your decision-making strategy?
 What will deter you from using a pre-existing region or a cloud provider, other than survivability and site reliability? Is it capacity or bandwidth, or could it be latency?
 Other than the age-old "proximity to the edge" or "proximity to the end users" that were dominant factors a few years ago, are there new emerging considerations that you're applying lately when deciding where to put a new sizable footprint?
  
I'm sure you'll think about greenfield (brand new project, no restrictions) vs brownfield (where this new workload has to coexist and work together with legacy infrastructure). If your analysis is made simpler by considering a branny-new slate for a new project, how would you approach it?

 Like to read see below: For some specific reason we use this, I am new~ish to the team so don’t roast me just yet, but I have been getting complaints from day 3 that this process fails. When asked if it ever worked I get a “yea?”. It’s happening across multiple different systems across multiple networks. The only constant is windows 10 is the OS connecting to the servers rdp session. All the windows 10 are a base image to a bunch of vdi pools, the servers are scattered across networks and these vdi are used to manage it all. The user can have admin access to one or both side and get this. It seems to be 99% of users, like 1 person can get it to work and it’s pissing his peers off.

He's very green, still in college. He has some programming and database experience from school. We have decided it probably wouldn't make much sense to throw him on helpdesk as it would take just as long as the internship lasts to get him up to speed. Not saying he won't do troubleshooting, just not the entire time. 
 If you were an intern, what are some things you wished you had picked up in the sysadmin field that maybe you didn't during your internship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have LAPS setup and configured, but we’re having a disagreement internally about how to best retrieve the password. If we’re trying to avoid using privileged domain creds on a desktop, what’s the most secure way for a tech to retrieve the password? Whether we launch ADUC or use a Powershell script from the tech’s local desktop, we still need to auth to the domain.
 LAPS solves the local credential cache issue, but if the machine is compromised in some way (keylogger etc) then elevating to the domain to retrieve the password still potentially exposes these accounts.
 How are you all dealing with this? Not allowing techs to elevate from their local machines and using an isolated bastion host instead?

When connecting a Dell R720 server directly to the switch, with 10G fiber ports, there is no network traffic.The scenario is as follows: Dell R720 (NIC: Intel(R) 10G 2P X520 Adapter) + Dell R640 (NIC 1: BRCM 10G/GbE 2+2P 57800 rNDC) connected to Dell S4128F. In the image you can see the active server connections on ports 13, 14, 15 and 16, on port 25 a DAC cable is connected to another Dell S4128F (redundancy) and on port 27 a 1Gbps cable is connected to interconnect with a Dell 6248 (legacy network). Basically I need these servers to have a 10G network working.Thanks in advance.

 I need your opinions based on your experience or criteria about how do you will split and make those domains.My main concern its how do I made the peerings between domains. Should I use eBGP? BGP Confederation?? Bear in mind that the current topology has all PEs with an iBGP peering against a pair of route reflectors

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, 
 Long time lurker, first time posting. 
 I've got a bit of a situation that I thought I had a solution to, but am now stumped. Please excuse any ignorance or lack of detail. 
 The scenario is, we've got a location that just had a 3rd party install a Fortigate FW needed for remote access to their devices. Said firewall needs direct internet access. Normally this vendor would use an LTE device to accomplish this, but the location is out in the boonies and service sucks, so that option is out the window. 
 Our current ISP has a Ciena fiber hand off with two 1 gbe ports (will come back to why this is relevant), one of which is being used to connect to our firewall for Internet access. The demarc for this fiber circuit is in a separate building from where the 3rd party Fortigate fw is located. The two buildings are connected via mm fiber and use Brocade/Ruckus switches. 
 My initial thought was to run a link from the open port in the handoff, to our switch in an access port with a newly created vlan in building one, and trunk the vlan across the network to building two where the Fortigate is located (access port again) and assign the interface on the Fortigate one of the IP's from our block. Well, that was the plan until I just got off the phone with our ISP, where the indicated that that open port is actually for an entirely new circuit that we would have to add to our account. So, I'm back to the drawing board. 
 As I eluded to early, we do have a block of IP's (/29) that we can use so I'm sure there's a solution, but I'm not sure how to achieve that. While I was only the phone with the ISP, they also indicated that in order to use that block, I'd have to have a L3 device to handle the routing of said block. I don't think leadership will agree to purchasing any equipment for this as things have been extremely tight. 
 Apologies if this is all over the place, it's been a hell of a day, and not just for the problem above. 
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. My company will be having a new ISP line installed at a new site and I was shown what the IP details were by my colleague. I'm quite confused! This is my first time being involved in this sort of stuff so I'm trying to understand as much as I can.
 In our other offices we have ISP circuits where we have been given a /29 IP range and we just assign the IP of our firewalls from this range and point the default gateway to that of the ISP router so it is a lot simpler.
 Now it's LAN IPs and WAN IPs and I've no idea how they relate to our current setup which is:
 Firewall (DHCP,NAT) > L2 switch > ISP router
 I know we need a router that will point all traffic to the ISP default gateway, that much is clear. There is a /29 range for the LAN side and a /30 for the WAN side.
 The way I see it is that we have to use 2 IPs from the /29 for the firewalls and another IP for the router interface facing the firewall. Then from the /30 range another router interface (pointing to the ISP router) will be configured with an IP and then a default route will point to the ISP's default gateway.
 I think that our setup will then be:
 Firewall (DHCP,NAT) > L2 switch (ISP failover) > Router > ISP router
 Am I on the right track with this or am I completely misunderstanding?

 I said only the network admin and system admin should receive privileged accounts and I got it wrong because the CISO should have also received privileged roles. I've worked at a number of companies and not once has a Chief anything Officer received any sort of admin permissions; they only dictate policy, budgets, etc.
 What are your opinions on this? Do the executives at your companies perform admin duties?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been struggling to bring up Private Peering on an ExpressRoute circuit delivered via Zayo. I've dug around for examples configuring this on a Nexus 9K and I've pieced a few things together, but I haven't been able to get a BGP session up. I appreciate any insight you might share.
 On my side I have 1G service delivered from Zayo into an eth port on a Nexus C93180YC-FX running NXOS 9.3(10). Zayo indicated that I should use QinQ and they're delivering the primary on VLAN A, secondary on VLAN B.
 My QinQ-fu isn't strong but at a high level my understanding is that I should be receiving S-tags A and B and using C-tag C, which is what I've configured for VLAN ID in Azure. Do I have that backwards? Microsoft's routing examples, though for IOS-XE, seem to indicate the reverse.
 I am consulting this article for configuring QinQ on the 9K.
 My issue is that all of the documentation I'm reading is around multiple inner tags with one outer tag. I believe I need the reverse. I've tried both the Configuring VLAN Mapping for Selective Q-in-Q on a 802.1Q Tunnel Port and Configuring Selective Q-in-Q with Multiple provider VLANs examples. I enter the first VLAN mapping switchport vlan mapping vlan-id-range dot1q-tunnel outer vlan-id and when I try to enter a second mapping with the same inner VLAN ID I receive an error about a conflicting mapping for the inner VLAN already existing on this port.
 Other info:
 I tried a configuration with just the primary to see if I could get BGP peering but nothing is coming up.

Unfortunately, it would only be rolled out to individual users based on documented need or general age upgrades (i.e., all new computers will have a 2.5G NICS, but they won't upgrade current computers). I am not due for an upgrade for a few years, and I won't be able to justify a "need" for the faster connection. But I want it.

 Laptop also has a 1G RJ45, and a second identical USB-C port.
 I think I need a new hub, but I can't find a product. Does this product exist: * RJ45 in (2.5Gbps or higher) * RJ45 out (for phone) * USB-C to computer (network and monitor) * USB-C to monitor (displayport passthrough)
 Power supply from the hub isn't needed. I may be willing to omit the RJ45 out to the phone and just forward it to my cell.

 At this point, are the two included/onboard DisplayPort ports enough to run two monitors and I can stop ordering desktops with the GPU and save the money?

 The apps were all made available to "All Users." Some I made available for enrolled devices, some I made available with or without enrollment, just to see if that made a difference. Still, nothing is showing as available.
 Also, what's the difference between "Available for enrolled devices" and "Available with or without enrollment?" How would someone access the available apps if their device isn't enrolled?

 One computer executes it fine. The other says "unable to execute" (even as root)
 I have check the fstab file and the mount is the same. Both do not have firewall enabled. What is blocking one computer from executing scripts? Is there a place to check if the overall file system has a noexec? Because looking at both computers theirs are similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, curious if anybody has an idea what could be causing the following error that I am seeing in the logs of our 9000 series Cisco switches:
 ​
 Examples (from different Switches):
 "%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 1 R0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed."
 "%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 5 R0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed."
 "%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 1 F0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed."
 ​
 This log pops up after a reboot in about 50% of the 300 or so C9000 Switches that I have polled so far. All Switches are running 17.03.05. A few have been upgraded to 17.06.05 for testing but the log error is apparent in both versions. So far, I have polled C9200-24T, C9200-24P, C9200-48P, C9200-48T and C9300-48Ps. All models show the log. Some are standalone switches, some are stacks with up to 8 switches.
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings all!
 We have a b2b direct connect setup with another tenant (both sides), and until recently it worked fine, we could create shared channels and upload files there and sync those files to devices using the sync option.
 But since a few days ago (maybe even before, not a lot of people use this option and edit the files online) users from the other tenant (and ours on their shared channels) started having issues with syncing files from a shared teams channel to their pc.
 They can access and work on the files in the browser or through teams, but can't sync the files to their pc, they either get an error that says: "sorry onedrive can't add your folder right now, you might not have permissions to this folder, or it may belong to another organization", or when they click sync (either from teams or from the sharepoint site it self, it doesn't matter) it starts the onedrive app, flashes a blank window and closes the window, and nothing happens.
 What is the issue here? we didn't change anything on the tenant or shared channel setup, it just stopped working. We tried it from both sides and its the same issue. Did the direct connect mess up somehow? is it a onedrive app issue? We tried all the usual stuff like reinstalling the onedrive app to the latest version, cleaning the cache, even new installs of windows, we tried different users and new/old groups/channels. I've opened a support ticket with microsoft, but thought someone here maybe had the same issue and managed to sort it?
 Any advice would be extremely helpful!
 (also sorry if i opened this topic in the wrong reddit site, feel free to point me in the right direction :D)

Let's put a number of five (5) TVs.
 Some of our personnel are worried about internet-specific bandwidth. I recommended that we downgrade the stream quality to preserve bandwidth but limit each TV to 5Mbs max. Obviously, that is going to be 20Mpbs out of 1000Mbp. At max out usage is about 80Mbps at peak times. Meaning there is quite a bit of headway.

 Have you ever achieved installing quick assist on Windows Server 2019? We’ve managed to install it yet it won’t launch..

 The goal: Print black labels with white text using my Zebra GX430t.
 The problem: I can't seem to find a way to do this using Zebra Designer 3 free version. The solution using Zebra Designer 2 is not very good.
 The details:
 I have a Zebra GX430t with 76x127mm direct thermal labels. I am able to print perfectly well using the Zebra Designer 3 software by adding black text, objects etc. These print absolutely fine. What I want to do is to print exactly the same kinds of labels but with white text on black background rather than black text on white background.

 We've been using Gravityzone endpoint for the past month now. A common alert we see on reports are PST trojan alerts. The trouble is it occasionally deletes the users entire PST file, and of course most don't know how to check their quarantine despite being shown how to many times...
 Is it worth turning off scanning of email archives? I only use webmail myself, and most of the spam filtering should be done by Google first before arriving in Outlook, so I doubt this is a feature our users will need.

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/13qhtwe/powershell_script_for_automating_intune/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-24T10:36:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 If you're managing a large number of Azure-joined devices, you're probably well aware that manually enrolling each one into Intune can be quite time-consuming. To streamline this process, I've put together a PowerShell script that automates it.
 Here's an overview of the script's functions:
 Creates an MDM Key: The script generates an MDM key if it doesn't already exist.
 Enables Automatic MDM Enrollment: It sets up automatic MDM enrollment using Azure AD credentials.
 Generates Necessary Registry Keys: These keys are essential for the enrollment process.
 Initiates Group Policy Update: It forces a group policy update using the gpupdate /force command.
 Defines Enrollment URLs: The script assigns the required MDM enrollment URLs.
 Automates Device Enrollment: It calls upon deviceenroller.exe to automatically enroll the device in MDM.
 You can find the full script here: https://github.com/fKryptek/Intune/blob/main/EnrollToIntune.ps1
 As with any script you find online, I highly recommend reviewing it, tailoring it to your needs, and testing it within a controlled environment before deploying it on a larger scale.
 I'm interested in hearing about your experiences with the script, as well as any modifications or improvements you might suggest. If you encounter any problems or have questions, please let me know.
 Looking forward to your feedback.
 If you'd like to buy me a coffee for my efforts : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bobbyhalford
 P.S.: Keep in mind, the effectiveness of this script may vary based on your Azure AD and Intune setup. Always customize and test in your own environment.

 The issue we have is SELF does not have rights to read or “write to personal information “ Which stops the correct enrolment of MDE as it needs to write a certificate to the personal store on the server. 
 Anyone else have this issue or would mind checking perms on their computer account object see if the default view has more than “change password” and “special”
 I want to change the perms but don’t want to bork the server. 
 My lab server has has normal permissions to SELF such as “Create All Child Objects” “Delete all child objects” “validate write to DNS host name” “read personal information “ “write personal information” “special”
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Picked up a new envornment in the last 6 months and trying to understand why we have a fair amount of CPU resource avaiable, but still high CPU ready times in our Preprod resource pool. I THINK it's due to how our resource pools are configured but not 100% sure.
 We have 2 resource pools: Prod and Preprod.
 Screenshots on how they're setup: https://imgur.com/a/k62Po8S
 What I THINK is going on: 
 Although we have "enough" CPU resources within the cluster, because preprod is set to low, it'll never be able to contend with prod.
 However, if I set Prod to High, and Preprod to Normal.. I'll still have a 1:2 ratio of 4000 to 8000..
 So I'm not sure if that'll solve my problem?
 I'm also not sure if I should set a CPU reservation / limit closer to what the actual usage is?

 So I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my chances of applying for Network Engineer role (again).
 My situation is kind of different from the ‘normal’ network engineer career path. 
 I had started as a junior network engineer as my first IT job(i got quite lucky) then after 3years of experience i got my CCNA certification. But due to a position limit for network engineer at our company my manager had asked me to change to Helpdesk engineer since we were lacking in that area. So now i have just over a year of experience in helpdesk as of now.
 Currently i am working towards my CCNP but i would like to ask what are my chances of getting a job back in as a network engineer? Since normally people go from helpdesk to network engineer. Will this be effect my chances of going back to network engineer?
 Any feedback on my chances and what i can do to improve my chances will be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been using Lansweeper for 5 years now, apart from the Helpdesk lacking many features and possibilitys and the mail notifications being a bit unreliable, it did it's job for a relatively low price. Asset Management was also not the greatest, but it was on Premise and again, did it's job "good enough". Deployments were always a bit messy. 
 With the recent changes Lansweeper made to their licensing structure, we are definately not going to pay premium for a Cloud Solution that doesn't do much better in the other reagards. 
 So basically: Are there any alternatives? 
 Price doesn't play that much of a role anymore, things have changed considerably and the IT-Budget got a pretty heavy bump (although it's still not absolutely massive and we are still only 4 people in the Team, so it has to be something that's relatively easy to learn...)
 Main point is: It has to be On-Prem. ITAM with connected Helpdesk would be something very nice as well. All i have found was ManageEngine, but i've not found any user stories about it :D 
 Any help would be appriciented - thanks! :)

 I'm having trouble understanding the benefits of SFTP over something like transfer via HTTPS to an s3 bucket. With s3 we can have multipart file transfers up to 5TB over TLS 1.2/3, and manage auth with iam + sigv4.
 I'm wondering what benefits SFTP provides/why is it used today other than historical/legal reasons. Is SSH more secure than TLS 1.3? Is ssh based file transfer faster?
 Again, sorry if this is dumb,
 Thanks

During the majority of this time I’ve been operating heavy equipment for my civilian job, its pretty good money between 80k-100k a year depending on how much over time I chose to work. During this time I’ve accumulated bills like a house, wife, car, ect… in my military career I’ve gone over seas 3 times totaling about 2 years and some change of time spent in country working as a sys admin. This last deployment I really decided I wanted to pursue IT as a career. While deployed I got my Sec+ and started looking for jobs back home in the Chicago area. I’m struggling to find a job that pays enough to support my wife and current living expenses. I am willing to take a small pay cut to get started in the industry. I guess my question is does anyone have any guidance on how to proceed or what I should do. 
 Note: I absolutely hate my current job. 
 And I still have an active security clearance if that helps

I checked the page for the keystone jacks, and come to find in the specs it says “gold plated brass connectors”… I’m not a professional or anything but I do know that connectors that are not pure copper can have issues carrying POE current (such as CCA)… I’m trying to figure out what the issue could be, and I’m wondering if the interface medium could be the culprit before I start tearing everything apart and ordering new stuff. I would assume these “ubiquiti pros” wouldn’t recommend a product that clearly doesn’t work with the POE powered APs, but stupider things have happened.

I can't ping from one to the other, but both show the int is up/up. On the A side, I reset counters, and notice that my RX packets and bytes exactly matches my TX packets and bytes. Also odd, I see the A size in A's LLDP neighbors table, showing in/out port to be the same. B side sees up/up, but BGP is down, and B can't see anything from other side (no lldp either).
 Has anybody ever seen a carrier disconnect a circuit by making it loop back to itself? (Lumen, in this case)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I had a company reach out to me after viewing my resume and gave me the song and dance stating they felt I would be an amazing fit, my experience is exactly what they need, blah blah blah.
 The job was for a systems engineering/architect position 
 In the email they told me to select three days that would be good to interview and a bit more about what I do.
 I responded and sent the days they were asking for a went into more detail about my job, related tasks, but kept it quite brief so to save the rest for the interview.
 Well the first day I put on there was for yesterday and I heard nothing, so I sent a follow up email asking if the interview was still occurring and the day ends with me still hearing nothing.
 So I looked up the company the following day again to make sure it is a legitimate company, which it is, just to make sure I wasn’t getting messed with.
 Why ask to interview me just to ghost me and not have the decency to at least tell me something.
 The job market is tough enough as is for most people, companies that do this do not make things any better.
 Is this common?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any way to "translate" or "map" a device's IP to a different IP in a L3 switch without NAT capabilities?
 My situation is: I'd like to avoid changing the device's configuration and I need to connect several (about 30) devices with identical IPs configured, while having no IP conflicts and being able to access every individual device through HTTP.
 For example, have the "192.168.1.1/24" in port 1 become "192.168.10.1/24", then have "192.168.1.1/24" in port 2 become "192.168.10.2/24" and so on... And then access the device in port "n" through "192.168.10.n/24" from another device, which would actually be correctly configured as "192.168.10.40/24".
 Or maybe there's a way to use the router's NAT configs and VLANs somehow? But I don't know if the fact that all the devices being configured in the same subnet would allow me to assign them to different VLANs, as far as I understand, each VLAN in a L3 switch should have a different subnet. I can't picture it. Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I know it's not a typical use case but I figured I'd ask the experts.

 This is a two part question.
 What would be a use case to have employees authenticate to AD before using company guest Wi-Fi services. I see some enterprises deploy two guest (no internal access) Wi-Fi services, one for guests and one for employees. I would like to know what benefit, other employee tracking, would be achieved by authenticating employees for guest Wi-Fi and opening the dmz to internal for this sake.
 The second question is whether any NAC product can authenticate guest Wi-Fi employee access locally via email confirmation sent to company email, I.e. by giving a temporary email only access during authentication so that the confirmation Code is received to the user on his corporate email. This is to avoid AD authentication and punching a hole from dmz to internal AD servers.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,My company is on the way to complete the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process. One open and hotly discussed point is the logging issue.I am a big friend of "GrayLog" which we have been using for a long time in the free version. However, our IT security officer says that a protection against manipulation of the log events cannot be guaranteed. The product variant "GRAYLOG SECURITY" would fulfill this requirement, but due to the licensing of the complete Elasticsearch stack with the machine learning features and the "top-notch-enterprise" requirements on the base system (Oracle DB etc.) this is unfortunately too expensive for us.I found this method on the net to write a signature in each event and validate it again on readout (https://community.graylog.org/t/graylog-for-integrity-log-hashing/15570), however this is obviously not enough as a user with admin rights could easily manipulate these hashes.Has anyone ever done the GRAYLOG FREE task as ISO/IEC 27001 compliant logging and can give me some hints on how to implement this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 Some people here may understand the situation we're in.
 Basically, we have singular users working in remote parts of the UK (literally miles from the nearest mobile tower), where mobile dongles/sim hubs just do not work. The users have relatively low bandwidth usage, they mainly use SharePoint for Word and Excel collaboration, possibly some infrequent Teams calls. 
 We've had quotes in the past for installing leased lines (far too expensive and takes far too long for the cable to be laid; 3-6 months for a 12 month project) 
 Basically, we've tested StarLink (the standard residential edition) and it's an absolute godsend. It's relieved such a massive headache for the onsite user and from me from a sysadmin perspective. 
 We don't need the business edition, it's far too expensive (£2400 for the kit and £240 p/m) and we don't need the bandwidth or speeds. It's literally 1 person in a cabin working from 1 PC...
 Should we continue down this road or do you think we could encounter issues in the future using the residential service? I do feel it's slightly amoral? 
 Thanks guys

 I have three switches (QNAP, FS, and SuperMicro), each with SFP28 (25Gb) ports. The ports works fine for connecting to servers, both using DAC cables and fiber with transceivers.
 However, I am unable to get any two of the switches to connect to each other via SFP28 ports. The ports on both sides act like nothing is connected to the port. The switches do communicate fine via RJ45 ports.
 Any idea what I'm missing here? Seems like a really basic thing to do (using SFP28 ports for uplink).

 The TOTP "server" could be self-hosted, and users could be told to use Google Authenticator, Authy, etc. If banks didn't want to do that, they could build a TOTP client in a day into their apps.
 Why is it that if a bank supports TOTP, it seems they can only do phone or email authentication? 
 AND, for apps on my phone that require passwords but log me out periodically (CHASE), it would be great to see in the app a warning for days left in session. I didn't always keep a copy of my password database in my phone, and so I could be across the country and suddenly be locked out of my bank accounts.
 TLDR - Bank 2FA seems to blow, with no indication as to why, and their session management also sucks.
 If anyone has insight, let me know. I figure this is appropriate for /r/sysadmin because I have been in the field and wonder what is holding the security teams back from doing things correctly at these institutions.

 I wanted to get some advice on an odd issue ive been running down for a while. 
 In short, I have a medical clinic with an older Xray machine with a Linux workstation. Basically getting a lot of TCP resend requests from this device when communicating with its local PACS server ( same location, both connected to the same switch). Further investigation with packet capture, I see at the point where it fails i get a TCP ZeroWindow reply from the Xray machine
 Its my understanding that the TCP window size should be negotiated between the 2 devices in the initial SYN, and should Match. However the Xray machine shows a window of 50000, and the Server its communicating with shows 64240 for the window size. 
 Is there a way on Server 2019 to set that window size? I found regfixes that were for server 2003, but did not work. I also turned off autotuning, no change. 
 The Xray machine is old, so I'm suspecting that's what we are running into, but I wanted to confirm if I had any options to set this on my server side.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am trying to understand the benefit of VLANs and how they work still. Hopefully I can clearly and concisely explain my setup and confusion.
 In this example network topology, there is currently zero VLAN or network segmentation. We have one WAN feeding a Fortinet Firewall, with the Fortinet configured for DHCP relay pointing to a 2012 R2 server. This server only has one scope that all devices live in. The scope is 10.10.8.1/22 (but only handing IPs out from 10.10.8.10 - 10.10.9.248). Then the Fortinet is feeding a few miscellaneous switches that are essentially dummy switches all daisy chained together feeding them. There is zero configuration on them.
 So now I have a new HP 1920S switch I would like to integrate. And I would like to segment 36 out of the 48 ports of this switch into 3 different VLANs that cannot interact with our main 10.10.8.1/22 network. The groups being VLAN10; ports 1-12, VLAN20; ports 13-24, and VLAN30; ports 25-36, while using port 48 as a trunk for the 3 VLANs. This "trunk" (HP terms) is being fed into the piggybacked dummy switches. But when I test the isolation of these VLANs by plugging in two devices across two different VLAN segments, I can still ping eachother. This is where I think my lack of foundational network knowledge is hurting me...
 Even though I have 3 different VLANs configured on the switch, do I also need to create 3 different DHCP scopes to truly separate the various VLAN traffic from each other and the rest of the 10.10.8.1/22 network? If so, how do I tell the relevant VLAN traffic to be assigned to these new particular DHCP scopes? Is that done through more configuration in the HP switch, itself? I am trying to determine if I setup VLAN incorrectly and it's not behaving how it should, or it's setup correctly and my understanding isn't correct.
 I hope this makes sense. Thank you for any input!

We have a customer who is trying to abandon their old network that consists a lot of FR/HDLC/PPP interfaces. They are currently connected to a channelized STM1 interface of a Cisco ASR9000 router. The core network is running MPLS but they want to move the connections to the newer ASR9900 routers while they convince customers to move to ethernet and they no longer want to introduce legacy circuit types into the 9900 routers (not sure if there's any module that still supports it there) The interfaces consists of L3VPN and L2VPN doing interworking. Are there any suggestions here on what device we can possibly put in to migrate those legacy circuits into a separate box so that we just connect that box into the ASR9900 as ethernet? There are suggestions that we use an ASR 1000 as the CE for these connections. Any other products outside Cisco shop? Thanks in advance.

 Hi folks, 
 I replied to a post here a while ago about how I collect laptops and rebuild them for foster kids and families in Denver, Colorado, USA. I had a lot of private messages sent to me asking how to help but haven’t been able to post till now. 
 I have been in IT officially for about 6 years now and after I had one foster child who kept punching my laptop when he got mad at a game, I thought that maybe other foster families had this same issue and needed a repaired laptop or a laptop for the kids. I worked with my office building and started collecting any desktop/laptops that were in the basement Tom be recycled, made about 100 systems - then the pandemic hit and the demand went up. 
 I’ve been able to rebuild about 400+ laptops on my own (windows, Mac, a few Ubuntu set ups) and distribute them - but we’re running low and the need keeps growing. 
 If anyone wants to unload systems for tax credit through a registered 501c3, we can accept donations and send you a blank form for tax write offs, and even make a post thanking you on linked in for free marketing. The goal is that you and your company win, and the kids win. 
 Though I expose my identity a bit doing this, here is a LinkedIn link where you can search the history of this charity I run and who I partner with to know it’s legit.

 No pressure, but if you can help, there are lots of foster kids and families in our area who could use these!

When using the latest "Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -Online", I eventually got the "806 - ZtdDeviceAlreadyAssigned" error. No big deal, dummy me did a typo on the serial number. Well, I went through Intune Enrollment and also verified in MS4B that this device serial number does not exist. Looking in AAD, it also verifies the device is in Autopilot but I cannot find it to assign a new tag to the device. 
 Since the device hash is clearly registered but cannot find it from the serial number (and no the mobo hasn't been replaced), how can I find the device to assign the necessary group tag?

 testing our first move, on one site we decreased the TTL on the oracle\dyn side, and set it low on Amazon side. so do we then go to our domain host and add the amazon dns servers, or do we instead remove dyndns and THEN add amazon once we see the TTL updated?

 I am trying to implement so that separate admin accounts can promote themselves to Domain Admin when they need it temporarily. Is there is a way to do this?
 Or is the best way to create a master domain account locked down to only login into the DCs that perhaps the IT manager could promote the account or maybe do the domain admin task required.

 Thanks for any advice.

 Hope the Reddit Gods can help me out with this one.
 So I have one switch with two ports aggregated and using LACP. They connect to a stack switch with two members, to one port on each member. The two ports on the stack are also a part of a LAG with LACP enabled.
 My question is should one member of the stack die what exactly happens after the LACP timeout occurs on the other member?

 I hope someone here can point me in the right direction where to start because I have been trying but cannot figure out what's happening:
 Issue:Both my MacMini as well as my MacBook have problems connecting to my Private WiFi (Guest WiFi works fine). Once connected get assigned an IPv4 Address but loose it right away and assign themselves an IPv6 Address. The IPv4 Information in the macOS Settings is empty. Once I click on "Renew DHCP Lease" it gets assigned an IP again and Connection works for around 10 seconds before it disappears again.
 Setup:Devices: MacBook Pro 2015, MacMini M1Network: Ubiquity Unifi Dream Machine, Connected via WiFi to main Network, already opened a ticket with support but they told me the logs look fine and they cannot find anything. The Devices appear as offline in the Unifi Interface despite being connected.
 Is this a Unifi Issue or a macOS Issue? Where can I start to look for fixesThanks so much in advance for any help!!

They’re not joined to a domain and he has everyone’s passwords written down. There’s no ticketing system. No group policy. No system images. No software deployment tools. No standard computer that they’re ordering, just whatever seems good on Amazon. No naming convention for devices. He’s got users in AD for their email address but besides that, pretty much nothing.
 I’m trying to take a deep breath on this stuff as I know these changes take time, but I’m not used to an overhaul like this. My gauge in the company is that they aren’t going to want to spend money to make changes because it has “worked” for this long. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should prioritize and approach this?

 https://northwave-cybersecurity.com/threat-intel-research/analysis-of-new-active-malware-mediaarena-pua
 We have several hundred machines in our environment that we confirmed have it installed and we are trying to find a way to remove it. I've drilled down into the registry and found the uninstall string but the one it lists basically just deletes the key.
 cmd.exe /c reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\PDFPower /f
 Has anyone found a better way to uninstall it via script? As I'm not confident that actually uninstalls the app and it just removes it from being listed in the registry and programs/features.
 If you're dealing with this you're aware is sets your default search engine to one their own (AASearchpoweronline). Is resetting edge settings enough to fix that?

 ​
 pretty straight forward i want the hostname to be resolved to that static IP however , adding a New Host always assumes that i want to add a FQDN for that machine . which in my case isn't i just want to add machine called Linux1
 ​
 I tried and created a new FLZ named only Linux1 and then added a new entry and left the name blank so it inherited the domain name which is Linux1.
 But still no Luck , when i try to ping Linux1
 ​
 Ping request could not find host Linux1 .Please check the name and try again.

 The question may sound stupid, because there are a lot of articles and videos showing how to do this. But it doesn't work for me.
 What I did:
  
I set SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable
 Rebooted my computer
 I've run Wireshark and was surfing a site I want to see a traffic for
 Stopped Wireshark. The log file isn't empty.
 In Wireshark, I went to Edit/Preferences/Protocols/TLS and for input field (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename I set path to file which I've set path to in SSLKEYLOGFILE variable
  
After all that I see following in Wireshark: https://ibb.co/qBm0Kc3
 I use Windows 10 and Wireshark 4.0.5
 How can I fix that?

 I think have reached that point or about to reach that point where you no longer care about working extra hard, pleasing users and execs, going the extra mile, being innovative etc 
 Reason? it seems like my efforts are not recognised and rewarded 
 To be frank if i start working according to my job description now i will be seen as slacking because i have normalized working extra hard and going the extra mile since day one, taking calls on weekends, after hours, lucnh time etc, speedy resolution of issues (its now 3 and a half years now as helpdesk IT technician)
 To be fair as well i have not increased qualifications on paper but i have upskilled on the job and taken up extra tasks which were not initially on my job description -specifically im now somewhat of a lite system admin because i have been opened to some administration tasks and given rights to several systems 
 The companies, systems and users to support has grown a lot in the past 3 years and the parent company is on track to launch new companies who we will all support 
 Still the paycheck is the same as it was 3 years ago.

 I am trying to figure out the best way to make it so that they cannot access certain sensitive pages, such as ‘analytics’, ‘gigs’, ‘settings’, etc.
 I am tech savvy but I have absolutely no clue the best way to do this? I was thinking about a virtual desktop service where they log in to a user, and that computer has some great programming that blocks those URLS, but that may be a bit glitchy, i’m not sure.
 I need advice on the best way to do this?

Where I'm at now uses those Surface Hub look-alikes and their built in microphone sucks. Management refuse to implement an actual microphone solution and just blame the bad audio on f/w and this and that.
 I looked around and I have never seen anyone tried/done that, connecting a CPW90 to a PC. Does anyone here had any experience?
 I am thinking if a generic DECT receiver / base station will be compatible with it.
 Or, does anyone has recommendations for products with similar form factor (1 base station, 2 wireless microphones, similar price tag is a big plus)

 We have finalllyyyyyy gotten some test lab hardware.
 So now i am playing with 2 nexus 9k's and have upgraded them to 10.3.3.F ( in production today we are running 9.3.10 ).
 And the most wanted feature has been commit and rollback like we have on XR's.
 With the conf dual-stage that is now a thing on nexus'es running code 10.1(2) or newer.
 What are your thoughts on this, and also have you guys used it?
 Main thing that annoys me a bit, is that it doesn't replace configure ( conf t ).
 And also that you cannot do a config banner, to remind people that they should use conf dual-stage

 I'm a Sr.System Admin at University.
 We create an Azure AD account for students that serves as their email address, and SSO which allows login on public terminals in the library, access to various applications such as MS Office, PeopleSoft (student information system) etc.
 Students and Staff also bring their own devices to access all cloud-based SaaS products and applications on and off-campus
 On-campus Macs and PCs are managed using Azure Mobile Device Management (MDM). 
 My questions are:
 - Within the premise, students can connect their personal devices using wireless which only has internet access. Do you apply on the boarding checklist or MDM before granting access? We use SAML authentication.
 - Outside the premise, is it feasible to register thousands of devices into an MDM and implement a compliance checklist? Any tips and suggestions to apply to security measures to protect data and information?

 I have installed latest CU (2023-May) on my servers. 
 But , tenable is still reporting this vulnerability to us. 
 But , the MSQM service is still running on the servers and port 1801.
 I honestly thought patching will disable it after patching.
 Has anyone manually disabled MSMQ service and closed port 1801? Any issues afterward?

 Not sure where to start. A bit of background, Our organisation uses office 365 for emails, teams, and excel. We save all our files onto Egnyte. 
 We have an excel spreadsheet with high level financial projections for project invoicing (45 projects) then we have a seperate excel for resourcing planning, and finally each project has 3 excels for document control management and project deliverables. All these are saved on Egnyte. 
 I’m looking to hire someone to create a digital data dashboard for each project to see the high level data in one place that’s currently spread across 100 excel sheets. I want to reduce the amount of manual data transfer and human error in data input between various seperate excel files duplicating the same data. 
 I understand a lot of this data might need aggregating into a dataset saved on the cloud and then additional applications used to process and present the data such as power bi but I do not know the order or priority of setting an outline brief for someone to price the work for our organisation. 
 Any help would be welcome. 
 I am open to radical changes in the way information is structured and push towards cloud based office 365.

 Been working as a network admin/engineer for the past 7 years, based primarily on Aruba WiFi & Switching/Arista Switch/Cisco Routing/Palo Alto firewalls & SD-WAN/F5 load balancers & also Splunk. 
 I have been presented an opportunity for a role as a senior network engineer. The role is based on Fortinet SD-WAN/Firewalls, Ubiquiti WiFI/Switching. Company consists of a large number of sites, though the sites are small in size, so Ubiquiti makes sense for their business requirements. 
 Something that is making me hesitant, is the fact that this company is using Ubiquiti WiFi/Switching & doesn't sound like there is much of a solid plan to move away from this to an enterprise solution. The cash for this role is more than what I am currently on, but I am a little concerned that by taking the role, my skills with enterprise equipment will squander, and it will be hard to move into a more enterprise role in the future. 
 I use Ubiquiti equipment at home, and it is fine, but not sure I'd use it an enterprise setting. 
 TLDR: If I take a role working on Ubiquiti equipment, will this tarnish my resume/skillset?

The two users swore that they never called these people and one was a current customer and the other some random person.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to start assembling some quotes for NTP appliances for our Small-Medium Enterprise environment. 
 I want something that can pull GPS time, and Internet NTP, and maybe FM radio time. 
 We currently use our core ASR routers and I want to shift that responsibility off the routers (so they can just be standard NTP clients) and onto something with a precision hardware clock. 
 We are financial services, but have no requirement for PTP, So I just need NTPv4. 
 I might upgrade from a standard clock to an OCXO style oscillator, but we don't need Rubidium precision. 
 I'll probably buy four appliances.
 One in each data center, one in each major user site.
 Our data centers have historically difficult GPS reception, so I don't want to put all four in the 2 data centers. 
 The Symmetricom / Microsemi / Microchip S600 appliance is one product we'll get quotes on. 
 The Meinberg LANTime M1000 is another contender. 
 The Meinberg SyncFire 1200 feels like an updated M1000, so I'll explore that further as well. 
  
What other products in this space should I be looking at? 
  
Microsemi's Domain Time NTP client for Windows (and other OSes).
 Is this something worth exploring, or should I just leave Microsoft's w32time alone?
 I hate the way the PDC-emulator is the only device that feeds time into the rest of the domain.
 It violates the inherent resiliency of the NTP protocol's design. 
  
As always, the wisdom of the great collective is always appreciated.

 Basically the PD uses a third party (FUSUS) that goes on our network and has access to certain cameras over IP and a read user of the camera. Device needs internet access and access to 5-6 specific cameras.

 The problem appears when the consultant wants to share a folder from the SUSE Server with a Guest account, but in my domain the Group policy that allows that is disable by default. They say SAP established that is imperative to make the change to work.
 They gave me a microsoft KB (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/guest-access-in-smb2-is-disabled-by-default) to disable that policy and the shared folder works, but its an insecure practice and no one recommend it.
 It appers that the top management is going to push for this to happen.. Is this really the only way to do it as they say? can it be done in a more secure way? do i cross my arms when a ramsonware fuck things up?

 These are instructions for how to update java on your server. Ya know, java, the software with new and amazing critical vulnerabilities every other week. Well, BMC's solution for updating java for their java based software is that you need to hand edit dozens of files, registry keys, and environmental variables every single time. And because its java and it updates constantly you'll be doing it over and over. You'd better hope to god there were no mistakes either because remedy also generates hundreds of logs in improbable locations containing what might as well be alien hieroglyphs. This issue is one of hundreds of problems with this software. 
 One time I had to get a developer on the line (which took an act of god and over a week) because I followed their own instructions and it blew up my system. He told me the support article in question missed a critical step that would always blow up your system if you didn't do it. Apparently, updating the support articles was an ongoing project.
 My company is currently trying to switch vendors and I will do everything in my power to make it happen. If you have this software god help you.

 The one that is my main priority has over used 300 switchports and 11x 48-port patch-panels. There are 2 racks, one with 6 patches on the top half and the other with 5 patches on the top and switches on the bottom half. There are cable organizers on the racks but they are overflowing and literally will not fit a single cable more.
 I have never taken on something of this scale before so I want to make sure I'm not getting in over my head.

 So, I'm in the middle of driving my morning IT operations meeting and I'm getting Teams calls and messages from HR. ADP is “not working” and ADP is on the phone with HR saying that it's a problem with our firewall.
 HR wanted me to join the call but I told them I didn't have a problem statement from ADP to warrant IT involvement, but I'd investigate. I asked a few questions, gathered some errors and application behavior from HR, and then gathered some observations from some people on my team.
 Notable symptoms: people in HR couldn't access some company personnel management features in the mobile app or web portal, users at home couldn't access all features in the mobile app. Similar issues affecting multiple platforms on different networks.
 I informed HR via Teams that our firewall isn't selective like that and the information gathered offers strong evidence that it's something on ADP’s side that changed.
 Well, I was right. Sort of. Root cause? Accounts Payable failed to pay our ADP bill.

 Digging through the logs it was caused by slidetoshutdown.exe and upon recreating the scenario and testting with my touchscreen tablet and a test VM I was able to recreate it.
 by holding the power button on the tablet to trigger the local slidetoshutdown if you're also full screen RDP to a Windows machine it will also launch slidetoshutdown.exe dragging that window down will shut down the remote machine.
 can't find a gpo to disable it, not keen on replacing the exe, trying a disallow applocker rule for now.
 crazy that this is the first time I've heard of it happening considering how easy it is to do accidentally.

 What tools are available for this and does anyone have any experience in doing this?
 What else do we have to test? (I'm sure everything will be fine anyways since there won't be too many users initially and total users will still be 500-600 max for the site in the long term but still need to test).
 We have 3750 switches as access switches which are temporary (will be replaced by 9300s when they arrive). And nexus 9k switches as core in a Cisco 2-tier deployment with 2 gig redundant links back to the data center (which is like 10 miles away).
 Edit: can iperf be used for stress testing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have any good resources for best practices on a outdoor IP camera topology design? We are running into issues today with being able to reliable provide connectivity to cameras in large parking lots or fields (multiple acres). 
 Cameras installed on the exterior of the building are fine as we can home run them to our MDF/IDFs and the distance are typically under 100m. Where we run into issues is with our PTZ cameras on the outer part of the property which are typically over 100m from the closest MDF/IDF. Additionally, these cameras for the most part have a 60w/90w PoE requirement. 
 While each camera is over 100m from the closest MDF/IDF they are sometimes within 100m of a few neighboring cameras on poles/property edge. 
 We've gone down the rabbit hole of ethernet extenders, PoE extenders, fiber converters with PoE injectors, P2P wireless systems (separate from our wireless deployment), and they all are hit or miss. 
 Should we be looking a ring topology and deploying small outdoor PoE switches on the pole and connect as many cameras as we can, and the daisy chain of that switch via fiber to the next one? Or should we deploy a couple of edge switches in NEMA cabinets on the ground and feed as many cameras as we can from them?
 Appreciate any insight, experience, or resources anyone has for a situation like this.

 Why does this work without any VLANs setup on the switch and router?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a systems admin for a medium-sized org, and not super familiar with AWS, but wanting to know actual best practices for the scenario below. Please forgive the inexperience behind the question:
 Basically, our Dev team is moving a lot of dependencies for their apps away from local resources and more into our cloud environment. Currently, our media team writes directly to an on-prem FTP server and the dev team pulls the data from the FTP server and loads it into an S3 bucket. We have an application that pulls the content from the S3 bucket (as far as I'm aware). 
 Our lead dev asked if there was a way to connect our local network to an S3 bucket in AWS so that we can have our media team write their stuff directly to the S3 bucket rather than the local FTP server. I'm more familiar with Azure, so I had to do some digging as to how to make this happen. My initial thought is setting up a VPN to our VPC in AWS, but I may be way off on that. However, our IT Director is on an 8-week leave, and from a strategy perspective, I'm not sure if I'm the right person to make the call, as I'm still fairly new to the org.
 From what I've researched, there is a way to mount an S3 bucket to a local Linux server. My understanding is that the local host would act as a proxy that would eliminate the need to manually move the content into the S3 bucket.
 Am I off on this? For those who have had a similar scenario, could you please share what you did? Telling the dev team to kick rocks until our director gets back to have a more broad design discussion is not out of the question, but I figured I would do my homework before I did so.

 I've also seen solutions like printlogic which could be a good alternative however we also have an EFI Fiery printer.

 My PKI setup (which i inherited) consists of an offline root CA, an enteprise CA and another server with IIS for the http CRL availability.
 My Root CA CRL is expiring soon so i wanted to renew it.
 What i did:
 Fired up the Root CA, published the new CRL, copied the file to my Enterprise CA, used the command
 certutil -f -dspublish Root-CA.crl
 command completed succesfully, then copied the same CRL to the web server, restarted IIS.
 What happened:
 On pkiview i see that the CDP Location2 (the http) one is ok
 the cdp location 1 (ldap location) still shows the old CRL expiring date, it looks like it didn't renew it.
 i do this every year and last time i didn't have any issues.
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks for the help.

When i connect my Lenovo laptop or Dell xps 13 laptop I am able to use ethernet port without any issues including other features of thunderbolt port but i get connected to native vlan.
 When I go to windows and add vlan id to the network adapter, I do not get an ip assigned and it shows as unidentified network. If I had one laptop to use with the dock, I could have kept the port as untagged. I have the latest firmware on the dock along with drivers on both laptops.
 Previously i was using USB c dock and was able to use the feature without any issue. Any idea what can be the issue? Hopefully its not the dock, contains realtek ethernet port.

 We were having an issue with installing Feb 2023 .Net for Windows Server 2019 and also some Windows Server 2019 CU's. Fixes that we found online included the below, none of which worked: 
  
Running sfc /scannow (never runs, always says a reboot is pending, even when we found a fix around this running sfc /scannow did nothing
 Running various DISM commands that were recommended didnt't get us anywhere
 Tried extracting the update /cab files and installing them individually using DISM
  
My colleague found a fix which I am sharing here:
  
Take ownership of the following registry key then delete it:
  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\DriverOperations\0 2. Reboot the server - Sometimes the server will go through in percentages so let it be till it's completed, it can take 5 or 10 minutes 3. Try installing .Net Framework again - Upon a reboot, Windows will indicate with a "We couldn't complete the updates" message that it couldn't install the update but it will continue installing it anyway 4. Install the latest CU - After a reboot it will be stuck on "Working on updates: 100% Complete" for 7- hours so leave the server to finish updating overnight

 I have a c-level user who just had his XPS motherboard replaced (2nd time in 18 months). After logging in, his Outlook, Teams and OneDrive are not connecting. Error is https://i.imgur.com/2QxOJCr.png
 The official Dell doc on this issues says to rename C:\users\<userdir>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy, then reboot. But this isn't working. I have also renamed the other folder in that article, with no luck. 
 I've done a lot of googling on this issue and most responses say renaming the AAD folder above and rebooting fixed the issue.
 The TPM module is working according to powershell "get-tpm". 
 Anyone got any other tips to try? The last resort seems to be re-creating the user profile.

 What options can you advise if on the client side we want to see a simple window with online chat, and on our side the system with tickets, some information about the client (mail, country, etc.). If there will even be some metrics and a way to measure them - great. In general, free and more or less working analogue of Zendesk/Jira for text messaging.
 I'm thinking to do it via bot in Telegram, but I'm not sure if it will be convenient if there will be more than 100 clients.

 Most of the time I'll 'Run as Administrator', UAC prompt pops up, enter my admin credentials and no problems, same with RDP I'll enter my credentials to login and connect in (not run as admin in that scenario, just a standard RDP process)
 However every so often with no pattern I'll open a UAC or RDP prompt, enter my credentials and click OK and they just completely freeze up, UAC will eventually quit out after 5-10 minutes without opening anything, if I try and interact with the RDP prompt it sometimes comes up with 'Credential manager UI host is not responding'
 If I simply restart my PC it all works fine for a bit again before breaking again hours/days/weeks later out of the blue
 I've rebuilt my PC (I say PC, it's actually a VM) several times from scratch and it always comes back to haunt me eventually, happened with various Windows 10 builds and now I'm on Windows 11 22H2 but still the same and I've checked I'm fully up to date with Windows Update
 Does anyone have any ideas as it is starting to annoy me!

 Previously I was a system engineer working in a devops environment, apart of sustainment and test team. I enjoyed this position because I was always learning something new, and the work was never stagnant. I ended up leaving to finish up my bachelor’s in a remote position.
 Now having completed my bachelor’s, and even before then, I have lost all motivation in this role. The overall company environment isn’t completely horrible but it is severely lacking( the people are nice). Overall the lack of job motivation has also pushed into my self learning. In my previous role, I always had the urge to self learn to stay on top of the environment I was working on.
 I feel like I’m stuck in this role. In the past few months I have had overall positive interviews but no bites. Usually because my clearance is still processing or lacked skill in one area leaving me has the “silver trophy winner”.
 Tl;dr: Current role I lost all motivation, but feel like I’m stuck

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we're having a weird issue where some of our Windows Servers are jumping back and forth in time. 
 The worst example is one server jumping several years into the future(!) messing up our databases and applications running. Most of the servers are on vmware esxi hosts. I cant find anything in the OS logs that points to what exactly is the cause of it. Time-sync between host and VM is disabled as well. 
 ​
 From one server where it recently jumped three days into the future before reverting to the correct date and time some hours later:
 ​
 Event viewer logs Kernel-General Event ID 1:
 The system time has changed to ‎2023‎-‎05‎-‎18T09:39:30.714000000Z from ‎2023‎-‎05‎-‎15T00:23:08.061881200Z.
 Change Reason: An application or system component changed the time.
 ​
 No snapshots are taken in this time period that could be the trigger for the VM to synch time with its host. Has anyone seen this before or could guide me in the right direction?

 So I bought the cable and some pass through connectors as I heard they were easier, None of the cables I made worked so I looked back at the advert for the tool and it says not compatible with cat 6, I've now read they are thicker with staggered connectors. Am I ok to carry on using the tool I have with cat 5e rj45 connectors but cat 6 cable as I don't need the full 10gbs. I was just going to buy another crimping tool but most of the Amazon adverts say they are suitable for all sizes but how can they be if the Cat 6 ones are staggered 🤔 Thanks.

I was looking to push DFCI settings via Intune, but our devices are from Dell but all enrolled manually (Hardware Hash uploads), or by converting Hybrid devices, so the DFCI isn't available to us direct. We have access to things such as the TechDirect setup at Dell, so wondering if there's a way to 'confirm' device ownership to allow this?
 Long shot and not the end of the world if it doesn't work, but I thought worth asking!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have 4 office buildings dotted around a yard, currently using Netgear Orbi 6E but due to the fact the buildings are more than wifi range apart (though connected by wired LAN) the satellite nodes cannot communicate with the primary gateway node. That means I can't update them in place, I have to disconnect them and bring them into the same building to run updates. I think it's also causing satellites to inexplicably stop working every few months until they're restarted.
 Is there any 6E mesh system which doesn't mind if the nodes can't talk to each other over wifi? I'd really have expected just being on the same wired LAN would have been okay with the Orbi but no such luck. I don't really mind if it's consumer, the Orbi experience is very consumer despite being marketed to businesses. Wifi is secondary to ethernet in our offices, I just want a system that doesn't require frequent manual interventions.

 One of our servers, running Windows Server 2016 Standard, is having issues communicating with our Domain Controller (same OS).
 DNS is fine, with all the usual ping tests showing no issues:
 Ping server
 Ping example.local
 Ping server.example.local
 Signing into the problematic server is intermittently slow, with the following error messages being present:
 The Security System is auditing a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN 
 E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2/2611a202-62d5-4d03-923f-feb1cf81e719/EXAMPLE.local 
 with error code "There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. (0xc000005e)". --- The Security System is auditing a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN 
 ldap/SERVER.EXAMPLE.local/EXAMPLE.local@EXAMPLE.LOCAL 
 with error code "There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. (0xc000005e)".
 I believe we have isolated it to the security update KB5011233 - after uninstalling and rebooting the server on Friday, it worked fine; however it was reinstalled over the weekend and the issue is now recurring.
 I've looked online and tried a few fixes, but so far aside from uninstalling the update, I haven't been able to fix this.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

 I come to you to get some advise and opinions, maybe some insight, on who should be the owner of a shared folder. We had the issue this morning with someone who didn't have access since we couldn't properly re-inherit the permissions to the subfolders.
 The issue was that some folders were owned by User A, Creator of some subfolders, and not by User B, Owner of the Main shared folder.
 Normally it looks something like this. See picture below.
 Imgur Picture
 In my experience the Owner usually is the local Administrator or the group "Domain Admin". For now we have put "Domain Users" and we have added each user (not like on the picture) manually. Meaning that we don't yet work with an AD group that gets assigned to each user for access instead of each user is manually added.
 So my question is the following. Is it ok to leave "Domain Users" as owners or should be put "Domain Admins"? Is it maybe a security issue or cause other problems? It's been years since I've done it myself and I don't remember who I put as owner on those cases.

 ​
 - No Send Limit (Unlimited)
 - Test Send Limit (5)
 - Default Policy (500)
 ​
 1) Scoped a user to policy "Test Send Limit" and sent out 50 mails. User was restricted from sending in the Security Portal and an alert was triggered. But mails could be sent out half a day later without problems and the user was still blocked in the portal.
 2) Scoped a user to policy "No Send Limit". Multiple days passed, so enough time was given for the policy to be active in M365. Suddenly, user was restricted after sending out 500 mails as if the default policy applied. This can never be because the default policy has the lowest priority and therefore explicit policies always take precedence.
 ​
 This was raised as a ticket at Microsoft and escalated and I did supply them lots of information over multiple weeks. I never got the resolution to the problem and at some point they just stopped answering my mails.

 Since OD / SharePoint Online has been introduced in this company there has been a weird problem around.
 If I upload a file about 500MB or bigger to the cloud, synchronize it's directory to my local storage and then try to open it, I get the error "the rpc server is unavailable".
 The second try it always works and I've already checked/tried the following points:
 · Firewall
 · Tried different networks
 · Checked that the following services are up & running: -Remote Procedure Call (RPC), RPC Endpoint Mapper & DCOM Server Process Launcher
 · ipconfig /flushdns
 · Can't trace the network traffic because OD's traffic is encrypted
 The problem affects all clients in the company and I've never had it in any other OD/SharePoint environment, is anyone familiar with the issue and may even know the cause / a solution?
 Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

 The value had changed to "Microsoft managed" in our case because we had disabled it before 5/17. Now that it's been set again it sounds like it will stick, but this was pretty sneaky. We disabled it in order to shunt people to the full Microsoft Authenticator, which has a couple other key features.
 ​
  
Updated May 17, 2023: Today we are starting rollout for Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) to enter GA! The Microsoft managed value of this feature will be changed from ‘disabled’ to ‘enabled’ on June 9th. We have made some changes to the feature configuration, so if you made an update before GA (5/17), please validate that the feature is in the correct state for your tenant prior to June 9th. If you do not wish for this feature to be enabled on June 9th, move the state to ‘disabled’ or set users to include and exclude groups.
  
Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) is a feature that allows your users to complete multi-factor authentication for their work or school account using Outlook on their iOS or Android device. This feature will be enabled on June 9th for all tenants that have not disabled it.

 Got a customer in the process of migrating from their On-prem file server to SharePoint. They use Adobe Acrobat pretty extensively and would like to use the Adobe SharePoint online integration so they can save directly to SharePoint locations from Adobe. I've created a custom MSI installer with the Acrobat customisation wizard and got that working to enable the custom Adobe save and open experience.
 Wondering if there is a way to add SharePoint sites using this tool or a registry edit so that the SharePoint site file storage locations/accounts are preconfigured on install.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 I'm currently leading a project in my mid-sized organization, where we're undergoing a transition from Slack to Teams. The project was assigned to me recently, and we have a tight timeline of just 2 months to complete the transition. 
 However, the company has historically been resistant to change, and some executives have already expressed concerns about the switch. As a relatively new member of the company, I don't have much experience with Slack, but I've been entrusted with leading this transition.
 While I believe that people just need time to adjust to the new system, I wanted to reach out to the community for advice. 
 Are there any important considerations or potential challenges I should be aware of during this transition period? My goal is to ensure a seamless migration and minimize any disruptions to our workflow.
 Additionally, I'm curious to learn about the similarities and differences in features between Teams and Slack. Are there any features that exist in both platforms? Furthermore, I'd greatly appreciate any insights into unique features offered by Slack that may not be available in Teams.
 Thank you in advance for your guidance and insights!

 Hey folks,
 Quick question. Setting up some cabling (up to 45m of cable) which I plan to with two 10GbE NICs. Thinking of going with SFP+ slots for possible future fiber upgrade.
 Noticed something though: SFP+ modules seem to indicate a range limit, usually 30m or 80m max. Is this a SFP+ thing? Or do regular NICs have this too, but just don't advertise it?
 It was my expectation that with a normal 10GbE RJ45 NIC and proper cat6a under 100 meters, 10GbE links could be established. Now I have doubts about that being a thing or just a theoretical limit which are not feasible with normal NICs (and them just working under 30m too or something similar).
 Any advice, insight or recommendations would be awesome.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/networking!
 I'm a junior sysadmin/hobbyist working on a script and ansible suite for managing an automated lab infrastructure in a VMWare environment and am now looking for some input on E-W traffic design! (Preliminary note: As of current design, for any edge router 1-8 internal firewall 'zones' can be implemented and any one internal firewall 'zone' can be a mirrored DMZ of an internal zone. Any firewall in turn can manage 8 different portgroups connected to an arbitrary amount of hosts. All backdoor management is through an isolated private vlan.)
 In the first image I've connected the edge router to two portgroups, one for internal traffic and one for dmz traffic. Any firewall-router belonging to one of these two categories would be connected to one of these two portgroupps. https://snipboard.io/oSHWN5.jpg
 In the second image all firewall-routers have been isolated to their own portgroup, connected in turn to the edge-router. https://snipboard.io/oIU4r1.jpg
 My question is: What would be best practice with consideration of system internal traffic and separation of duties? Would you want the edge router to route internal east-west traffic if it delegated to different firewalls? Or would you want them on a shared 'uplink' portgroup and subnet and do the east-west traffic by themselves? Spontaneously I'd say that the edge-router should primarily be concerned with North-South and internal traffic is to be managed on the internal firewalls, but then again, I have little to no experience. Would these be easier to manage as well rather than muddying the waters to have the firewalls do *some* firewalling in regards to internal EW traffic and the edge router do *some* of that as well?
 I appreciate any input and thanks for reading. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting onboarded to be the senior admin at a small company as the existing admin is set to retire soon. They sell software which basically consists of a desktop app (office workers) and a mobile app (field works) with a back end in SQL.
 Most all our customers are small as well without dedicated IT depts. So if a customer chooses, our company will host their SQL & Web Server in a cloud VM, give it a public IP, and let the mobile app and desktop apps connect there rather than the customer hosting it themselves.
 Last week, I was being shown how we buy and license SQL for a new implementation. The guy showed me we get SQL standard and enough CALs to cover each office user, plus one CAL to cover every mobile user, because the app connects to a web server first, then to the SQL server, so SQL would never know that there's multiple app users.
 Granted MS licensing is convoluted, but this is not how I understand CALs. Every mobile user, even though the app is connecting to a middleware, needs a CAL right? Yet this is how they've sold their software for the past few years.
 Not sure exactly what to do now that I've seen this? Bringing it to the attention of owners potentially puts a target on me as overstepping and being a threat to their business model? I'm not even sure how to bring something like this up. Usually big problems are things that are visible like failed hardware. Owners might say "It works - I don't see the issue" and I don't blame them - it's hard to understand.
 Fixing it and just eating the license cost could be difficult given this company's size. Re-quoting customers that have been live for years on our software telling them they're not compliant seems equally impossible. Yet this is my living and I kinda need the company to do well so that I can do well. I feel like I've walked into a time bomb that was impossible to see from the outside.

They talk a good game but are lazy with failure to complete simple tasks fully, they constantly watch YouTube videos and suddenly minimise when I walk by but often too late so I can clearly see what they are up to and when I try to explain a task fully they constantly interrupt and don’t start talking about something totally irrelevant to the task. 
 It’s also coupled with 30 minute trips to the toilet that I cannot ignore as the bathroom is opposite my desk. 
 How would you deal with this individual, ideally I would like to replace them with someone who actually cares. 
 I have notified HR but need to gather a good approach to this too.

I have gone DND on Teams to stop all the popups in the corner of my screen while I focus on the task. This is something I’m very capable of dealing with; I just need everyone to go away for 20 mins.
 Phone call comes through to the office.
 Manager: Hi, what’s the problem?
 Me: Sorry? Problem?
 Manager: Why have you gone DND on Teams?
 Me: I’m working through an issue and don’t need the constant pop ups. It's distracting.
 Manager: Well you shouldn’t do that.
 Me: I’m sorry…
 Manager: I need to you to be available at all times.
 Me: I am available, I’m just busy.
 Manager: I don’t want anyone on DND. It looks bad.
 Me: What? It looks bad? For whom?
 Manager: For anyone that wants to contact you. Looks like you’re ignoring them.
 Me: Well at this moment in time I am ignoring them, I’m busy with this thing that needs fixing.
 Manager: Turn off DND. What if someone needs to contact you urgently?
 Me: Then they can phone me, like you’re doing now.
 Manager: … … just turn off DND.
 ... middle micro managers: desperate to know everyone's business at any given moment just in case there's something they don't know about and they can weigh in with some non-relevant ideas. I bet this comes up in next weeks team meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teams on Android is usually pretty stable and straightforward so it's surprising to see this issue. Even MS support, from my continued discussions with them, is baffled.
 Essentially, we got a user reporting that he doesn't have the option to select Bluetooth from the list of output devices. He just sees device and speaker. Issue started back in April.
 We can confirm the following with the user:
  
On a recent BYOD Android device -- Galaxy S22 Ultra running Android 13.
 We have no MDM in place to enforce a certain version of the app.
 Headset is a Sony WH-1000XM4.
 Can confirm the headset is detected and functional in other apps, e.g. YouTube, Audio Recorder, and Phones.
 Tried a cache clear through system settings and the Android settings itself.
 Tried a reinstall of Teams from the app store.
  
Not really sure why this would be happening and MS support feels the same way too.
 I'm thinking about having the user download an older version of Teams. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

 So I'm new to cloud support and our workflow is mostly in managing the server of our clients. Sometimes, we have a new client and they want to migrate their files from their current server to their new server(where we set-up and manage).
 My question is what is the best scripting language to compare old files to new files. The software we use is filezilla and sometimes filezilla doesn't fully transfer the files especially if it's a folder within a folder. But the main thing here is what is a good scripting language to compare files (size disk) & (contains) from old server to new. Because I checked the files manually and it's taking much time. 
 Thank you everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: an email migration was done to Office 365(exchange online).
 I set up a user with the outlook mobile app on their phone. They report however that emails only start to populate in the outlook app on the phone after opening the outlook desktop app that is profiled on a machine we have for the user. I have not been able to see this in action. Initially I thought it might have been the focused view. Turned that off and confirmed that emails were no longer missing. However, the user is reporting this happening again. I checked exchange properties and confirmed active sync is enabled and even detects the phone that is set up. Just posting here in case I am missing something to check or if y’all have run into this before. My guess is that it’s something with the client(mobile phone) as I have set up other users on their mobile phones and similar reports have not been heard. Thanks in advance for any advice/commentary. Just a bit paranoid is all since it’s a very important user.

 What is the right software for a 6-7 person project-based business? 
 We currently use a very small collection of sharepoint lists tied to a power-automate app to create template project folders/files in our teams/onedrive environment + project tracking using Microsoft Planner (all to varying levels of commitment to the digital system depending on the employee). Outlook basically handles all the rest of our customer interaction tracking.
 I have been casually looking at Odoo or Netsuite with the thought of doing a slow rollout myself starting with my projects and slowly rolling out to the other 5 employees. But this is so far down my list I wouldn't even say its totally on my radar. 
 That being said, if outlook is moving toward this "new" view, with all of those features missing, this may move way up my priorities list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for an MSP, with my title being Jr SysAdmin. It’s a completely unearned title, given that most of my day to day is typical help desk shenanigans, but my position is unique in that 90% of the company does remote work, 9.9% does on-site onboarding/infrastructure building, and I’m part of the 0.1% (as in ~3 people) who works on-site full time for a client.
 Well, the client wants to end the contract. CTO is a paranoid fuck and never wanted to give the keys up to any of his systems for us to work with, one of the reasons I was told is because I’m not part of their ethnoreligious group, so I’m considered an “outsider”. Fine, whatever. But everyone else at the client loves me. I get great customer feedback, my metrics are great, and even my supervisors are always singing my praises because of all the on-site techs they’ve sent in the past, I’m the only one who’s stuck around and been consistently good at the job.
 So the contract is up June 30th, and my company informed me that they won’t be keeping me on past that. They’re going to let me go despite a perfect record. I’m assuming it’s because I make $60k a year for what’s basically a glorified help desk, but I digress. 
 I don’t know why I’m writing this to be honest, I’m just frustrated as hell. I’m a Marine Corps Reservist, so that makes finding a civilian job harder. This also comes right after I signed off on a new apartment, and I have 3 weeks worth of obligations family/military wise in August. Fucking wish I never did IT, this shit blows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, fellow Redditors.
 We're currently facing some challenges with our large-scale mixed deployment of Switches and Wireless Access Points from Cisco and Aruba, and I'm hoping to gather some valuable insights and suggestions from the community.
 Our network infrastructure consists of both Cisco and Aruba devices, and the main difficulties we're encountering are as follows:
  
Different UI: Managing the network becomes a bit of a hassle due to the varying UIs. Aruba uses Airwave, while Cisco relies on DNAC. This disparity in UIs makes it time-consuming for us to navigate and configure both platforms efficiently. 
 Lack of Central Management and Monitoring: We're struggling with the absence of a centralized solution for managing and monitoring devices across both platforms. It would be ideal to have a single management system that allows us to seamlessly control and monitor both Cisco and Aruba devices.
 Single NAC Solution: We're in need of a Network Access Control (NAC) solution that is compatible with both Cisco and Aruba devices. This NAC solution should be fully functional and comply with standards such as RADIUS and TACACS+. Specifically, we're looking for features like MAC profiling for dynamic MAC registration, BYOD portals, and guest portals. Additionally, it should support both wired and wireless 802.1x authentication and provide administrative authentication for Aruba and Cisco devices.
  
Open to any suggestions or recommendations that can help us address these challenges. If you have faced similar situations or successfully integrated Cisco and Aruba devices in a mixed deployment, your expertise would be greatly appreciated!
 Please share your experiences, or any solutions you might know of that could help us overcome these issues. Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the second time in about 8 years of running a pair of LTM VEs under ESXi (vsphere cluster with Dell M640s, all dual-attached 10GE ports on VDS), I had one LTM VE "lose" its control plane but the data plane was still forwarding packets. The peer noticed the first one wasn't sending heartbeats, so it tried to acquire the resources and tell the first one to release resources. The first one stayed online, and the result was both were stealing each other's TCP sessions, causing random session resets, until I forcibly rebooted the first LTM VE node.
 This could have been prevented if the TMOS supported either sending a 'power off the peer' command to VCSA, or if the ESXi/LTM-VE combination was capable of having a watchdog configured, where the hypervisor would reset the VM if it failed to receive any watchdog heartbeats after some period of time.
 Are either of these possible? We're running TMOS 15.1.x, but can upgrade to 16.x if we need to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Sorry if this is not relevant to this sub-reddit). I want to simulate a network with N number of nodes, could be Ubuntu or any VM that are connected (virtually of course) and have some open-source routing daemon running on them (I am thinking FRR ?) that supports BGP. I would then like the nodes to advertise their loopback IPs to the other nodes (could be all eBGP sessions) and then, say a head VM that can monitor these BGP sessions on all nodes every hour or so to make sure the sessions are all in Established state. I wouldnt want to use simulators like NS-3 or so and wanted to create the VMs and the connections between them on my own. Any suggestions if this is possible and where I should start looking from? Since I wouldn't need GUI for controlling these VMs, I am thinking using something like kvm to launch multiple VMs on my laptop and then take it from there? Also for the open-source routing daemon, does FRR sound good? Thanks

They are way cheaper, compared to Fortigate and Cisco; which makes them quite attractive for a small business that just needs a solid firewall with VPN support- and without a lot of money for networking equipment... With that being said, the firewall will be protecting pretty much all the company "value", represented in a couple of source control servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a setup like this: snipboard.io/TrJVaH.jpg
 In the first step, let's assume two separate DSL lines going into two separate routers (VyOS machines). Both DSL lines provide public WAN IP via DHCP. VyOS boxes are configured to use NAT. On the inside VRRP is used for router redundancy.
 Now my concern is is NAT and its connection tracking. When a router handover occurs, all the connections will slowly have to time out (I believe). Is this the best that one can do?
 Now here is VRRP connection tracking sync. But I don't see how this would help since both boxes have a different WAN address. So even if all connection tracking is synced, responses from the internet will fail on handover because responses are sent to the old WAN address.
 ​
 The only way how I see this working if the internet somehow sees the same WAN for both routers. How can this work?
 Question 1: Let's assume we have no own IP network but only the two dynamically assigned WAN addresses by the two ISP. Is the sketched setup (without connection-tracking sync) the best that can be done?
 ​
 Question 2: Suppose we do have a /24 that is routed by the two ISPs. Now the public IPs are, say, 192.0.2.100 and 192.168.0.2.101 respectively. How would would one build a redundant router for an internal NAT network with that config? 
 The only way I can see this working is assigning the same public IP to the VyOS machine (some sort of "multicast") but that's of course not permissible. Or add another box in front of the two VyOS routers that performs NAT. But then there's again a single point of failure and no point in having redundant routers behind it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, so I was always the guy who told everybody that SA Lifetimes should match on both sides of IPSec tunnel.
 That was until last week when I was troubleshooting periodic downtimes on a tunnel that I just moved from ASA to our new Palo Alto. Remote side is a Virtual Private Gateway in our contractor's AWS VPC.
 They were occuring at random times when rekeying Phase 2 SA.
 Sometimes the tunnel was up for two days and then suddenly dropped. Sometimes it dropped after just 3 hours. (Phase 1 - 8 Hours, Phase 2 - 1 Hour)
 The worst thing was that only Phase 2 SA went down and the AWS endpoint wasn't able to deal with that so it always meant that nothing could pass through the tunnel until the IKE SA expired or until I cleared the SAs manually.
 Finally I got some time to troubleshoot and enabled debugs on PA. I also requested logs from the guy operating the AWS infrastructure (not a networking guy).
 After I had a look at these logs, I figured out that sometimes it would occur that we started rekeying the Phase 2 SA at the same time which eventually caused the new and the old SA to get deleted on PA.
 I ended up changing the P2 SA Lifetime so it's longer than configured lifetime on the other side and I have no problems since because only one side initiates the rekey now...

 With all the layoffs happening right now, I'm wondering if its safer to stay at my current company or jump. I feel like its very possible we may have layoffs coming next year and I know a lot of companies do layoffs by "last in first out"
 I feel like if I jumped jobs I could make way more money (like a lot more, probably 50% more), but not sure if that would open me up to less stability. I live in LCOL so while more money would def be nice, I'm not dying or anything. I also work 100% remote and am not open to anything not 100% remote. I feel like there isn't much room for advancement at current co, but the job is relatively chill most days and the benefits are good. Current co does offer decent severance also from what I've heard if layoffs did happen.
 I feel like I probably want to jump eventually but not sure if the timing is right. Would suck to change cos, then they announce massive layoffs and you're the first to be let go, since they just hired you. Any advice would be appreciated!

 I have 1 dedicated Windows 2019 DHCP server on a intranet setup. Sometime yesterday, my DHCP server is being flooded with BAD_ADDRESS entries. My clients are connected via lan port and no wireless connectivity is enabled. 
 Have tried removing the BAD_ADDRESS entries but they keep coming back almost immediately after deletion. 
 What could be the possible cause?

 We are experiencing issues with all the Macs that we updated to Ventura.
 Users are connecting via SMB (2.1 and 3.1.1) to our main fileserver (Server 2019) because we have a mixed Windows/Mac environment.
 This have been performed pretty well last years. But after upgrading several Macs to Ventura all the users with Ventura complaining about very poor performance with Quick preview. Sometimes it takes 20s to load a 20kb image. 
 Opening the file is not a problem and the image is loaded instantly, but the preview is not responding well.
 When the same users are working on our Archive server (Synology NAS) with SMB, they are having no issues.
 We even reinstalled several devices, but no luck. All the Monterey are not having any issues.
 I can’t find anything on the internet that may help resolve our issue. Hopefully someone here has the golden tip.

 So for some reason a department thought it was a great idea to include a 4.8Mb .gif file in their mail signature. This results in their emails being huge and it is quickly becoming an issue (no big surprise)
 Obviously we will send out a mail telling everyone yo not use any sort of .gif or .webm in their mails. At least not as attachments.
 &nbsp
 So my question is, is anyone blocking something like this? Would,it make sense to block .gif in mails if they are abive 250Kb or something? Any other suggestions.

 One of the healthcare Mobile apps used by Doctors provides instant messaging and voice services and some clinical notifications via integration to or EHR servers. All servers (App and EHR) are located in our premises in the internal segment, and we publish one port (xmpp) to the internet where the mobile app connects to.
 When doctors are at home, the mobile app gets instant messages only, no voice capabilities are enabled over the internet, as this is a regulatory compliance thing. 
 On premise, as standard security practice, all doctors personal mobile devices are in guest WiFi vlan, isolated from the internal resources. There is a requirement to open up the guest Wi-Fi vlan to the mobile app servers in the internal segment to enable voice services. Now I’m totally against this, and the mobile app does support any MAM integrations, but would like to understand how admins deal with and secure access to similar business mobile apps.

 I'm looking for a way to run containers simply like using Docker but safely using virtualization while keeping it performant as possible.
 I came across to two project that caught my attention:
 a) KataContainers
 b) Firecracker
 But I'm really confused about how they work, what are the differences and what is more performant. Would appreciate if anyone help me to clarify that.
 KataContainers looks simple. You can easily configure it as Docker container runtime. If I understand correctly, firecracker-containerd enables you to do the same as Kata, right? If so, what are the differences between them? What are pros and cons? In what cases should be one used over another? Which one is more performant?

The main problem is that I have is that i just get verbally told on what someone wants or if I'm trying to trouble shoot I like to normally draw the flow out on paper. So I'm looking to use it to make those initial diagrams I can sit with someone to get the "cigarette packet" drawing before making it look professional in Visio. Also I'll be using it to take notes from meetings and learning new subjects etc... The only game I would play on it is something like RuneScape 3 (Yes I'm still a kid at heart :D)
 I was hoping the Pixel Tablet would be a good option but since I'm UK based I feel like the £599 price tag compared to the $499 US price tag is kinda a **** take... Also I dont want the stand thing.
 I am now Looking at the OnePlus Pad with the Stylo Pen which would come to £550.
 So Question is the OnePlus a good option or is there something else I should be looking at? (No Apple Please...)

 On the first link (333-1), the AP powers up but links at 10Mbps, on the second port it links up fine at 1Gbps.
 I know this probably means the pair 3/6,7/8 are busted, but why did it still PASS a fluke test?
 Is there any docs to learn how to interpret these results in general?

I have recently been offered a job at a company where I would be the sole IT provider for location with 55+ people. Doing minimal server and Networking and help desk tickets.
 I currently work at MSP doing level two and three work. Maybe getting a promotion in the next year and was just approved for a pretty big raise. I'm not sure if this would be beneficial to my career so I was hoping to get some insight. 
 New job:
 Pros:
 * Not an MSP
 * 20k pay increase
 * Seems to be within my wheelhouse
 * Ownership of IT things ( Not MSP) 
 Cons:
 * Only IT for that office. No team or boss to bounce ideas off of. Not getting a great collaborative feeling from the remote IT team
 * Will be doing EVERYTHING. Powerpoints to network troubleshooting
 * Might be a step down technically speaking
 * No Work from home whatsoever. 
 Current job:
 Pros:
 * Job security
 * Great boss and team
 * I know what I'm doing, no learning curve.
 * Completely remote 
 Cons:
 * Overworked
 * Pay could be better
 * Feeling stagnant. 
 This would be the perfect position if I knew I had a good team and boss and had the chace to work from home some. I'm itching to get out of the MSP World and this is the first thing that's come my way in a long time.

 I’ve verified that it has the proper mic selected, but can’t seem to solve issue. 
 Anyone else experienced this?

 Our Linux team has a ton of monitoring tools that greatly increased their efficiency and i was wondering if something like that exists for m365 based software. Both tenant wide and maybe service based? Like getting a warning when user A is nearly running out of space on outlook or user B uploading an ungodly amount of files to OneDrive or something like that. Do tools like that exist?

 Host A pings Host B while Host B pings Host A.
 The result of Host A is Avg 0ms while the result of Host B is Avg 89ms tested with 20 pings.
 The Servers are virtualized in vsphere on 2 different hosts and the vsphere environment is connected to the bladecenter while the bladecenter is connected to vc switch which is connected to the 2 core switches. The Core switches are connected each to a firewall in active/passive mode where the VLAN of the 2 Servers terminates. The 2 physical ESX hosts are on different switch. Physical ESX Host A is connected to Core Switch 1 while physical ESX Host is connected to Core Switch 2. The Core Switches are connected with a Trunk Port of 2x 40 Gbit/s.
 The ping was executed in the same time on each host.
 Can someone explain what could be wrong here?

 Building manual, scheduled alerts on Splunk, I don't feel very confident I've covered all possible attack scenarios.
 An NDR with its dynamic, real time alerts seems the perfect missing piece. (We already have EDR, email security, proxy etc)
 My only question is, does an NDR actually give you a peace of mind that it will block any possible malicious network activity?
 Has it been an added value for you?

discovering fields/tasks that can be useful to the organization and brings more profit, convenience, efficiency etc
 that no one else is doing, knows about, has a plan to or knows how to
 introduce the tasks to management/executive and convince them to approve you to take on the tasks
 Once approved and deployed, develop and improve it to be critical to the organization mission -make the org to rely on it. It could be software, operational tasks, report generation etc
 voila you are no longer easy to fireable -not that you want to be the only one that knows it all because you can still share the skills with others/teach them.

        <updated>2023-05-20T05:29:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I administer a simple Active Directory domain where all joined computers run Windows Server 2012r2, and the domain includes a database running SQL Server 2014.
 I changed a domain-wide GPO from a “never” account lockout threshold to “3 invalid login attempts” in Computer Config\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies. 
 A few hours after pushing the new account lockout policy, our developer discovered that a SQL Server Login (not a Windows/domain user) was unable to authenticate via SSMS or other methods (connection strings, etc). after multiple attempts with an incorrect password. Error Log for MSSQLSERVER said Event ID 18456: Login failed for ‘redacted’. Reason: “The account is currently locked out. The system administrator can unlock it.”
 The SQL Login lockouts stopped happening after I reverted the GPO to a “never” lockout threshold.
 QUESTION: Is it possible that the domain GPO account lockout policy is responsible for locking that SQL login?
 I assumed that the GPO only acted on domain users, but all the evidence suggests that’s either exactly what happened, or that’s one heck of a coincidence.
 Maybe if a policy is applied to Domain Computers, it also applies to the Database Server and therefore to SQL logins? Doesn’t sound right… but I’m at a loss!
 Happy to clarify or add any additional info I might’ve forgotten. 
 Any insight would be tremendously appreciated, as my boss insists I understand exactly why this happens, and I desperately want to. thank you!

 Traditional Cisco solutions are like those massive Lego sets with a gazillion pieces. They are fun (if you're into that sort of thing), flexible, and the outcome can be magnificent. But you'll need an entire weekend, a big table, and maybe a magnifying glass.
 On the other hand, Meraki is like your friendly IKEA furniture set. Open the box, follow the colorful, wordless instructions, and voila! You've got a bookcase... or was it a table? Either way, it was easy, right? That's Meraki for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, solo IT jack of all trades here. I've got a couple users who demand using a Macbook and therefore have to use Parallels if they want to be able to still access some of the applications used at our business. For some users, the only application they need from Windows is actually a RemoteApp from a third party company application that is only supported/installed on Windows. We do not own or manage this server. I don't have admin access to the server and the remote company claims that there is no way for the RemoteApp to work on the Mac despite Microsoft having support for RemoteApps with their MacOS Remote Desktop App. In fact, I can even RDP into the server (but our accounts don't have desktop access so they disconnect immediately), and if I setup a remote app with the info I have about their server I can see/list the RemoteApps but when I attempt to launch them I get Error code 0x104 (Unable to connect).
 ​
 I actually still have full access to an older server that we used to use RemoteApp with, so I might be able to learn something by looking at it.
 ​
 TLDR: Company claims their 'custom' RemoteApp won't work on the Mac even though it's a glorified RDP connection. I say no but am not sure where to start. I have the RDP user credentials, server IP, and app name. I may be able to deduce the server filepath to the application as well.

 To modernize things a bit, I got a quote for Arista 7280SR3-48YC8 for about $25K a pop. But it looks like I can easily get a refurb Dell S5148F-ON for a tiny fraction of the cost. I was frankly surprised that the used price has come down this low, when new units from these vendors still easily fetch in the high $10K's and beyond, with huge lead times.
 Am I missing something here? It's not like I'm asking to compare Arista and Netgear… :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next month, I and a couple colleagues will be on a media job out of town where lots of our work (editing) will be done in our own hotel room. Our network setup usually involves a subnet which gets its internet connection through hotel rooms' wired ethernet jacks. (The subnet is for a network drive). However, this hotel we are staying in particular has no wired ethernet ports in its rooms, only (good) Wi-Fi through a seemingly well-installed Ruckus AP system. Speeds are already solid and in the hundreds of megabits. No captive portals. I know all of this because I was there a few months ago.
 I'm looking to experiment and create my own sub-network that obtains its internet uplink wirelessly from the hotel's Wi-Fi network. The machines don't have Wi-Fi capability, so I'd rather try first to accomplish internet uplink on the subnet level. Of course this would involve a device that can connect to the hotel's SSID and act as a wireless-to-wired bridge. The first device that comes to mind would be a wireless repeater, but to me that sounds cheap. Would that work? Does the Unifi line support this? Or is there other hardware that can do this?
 Thank you.

 Background
 I help administer a hybrid environment with both on-prem AD and AAD. We also use GCDS to sync user profiles over to google for gmail and other google apps. Staff use MS SAML SSO for authentication with google.
 After the schooldude f* up we instructed users who had been affected to use a self-service password reset link that had been implemented years ago. This link goes to our internal ADFS server and resets their password in our local AD.

 I manaeg a network of abiout 50vms (primarily an RDS farm) on a Hyper-V cluster. The network is physically isolated from our workstation netowork. My access is via RDP to management VM with RSAT installed or console login via RMM tools. Where possible all tasks are performed from the RSAT either via GUI or Powershell remoting. 
 ​
 I am trying to get my head around the best way to manage accounts when its primarly just me (and one other to help when i am away). 
 I currently just login to any machine with my DA account and dont use the web for anything. I have a non da account that i use if i need to access the RDS farm as a user and peform non DA tasks (using the software we host in the farm) 
 ​
  
Should i be logging in to servers as a local admin user only? 
 Log into RSAT as a standard user and always use "runas" to lauch managment tools. 
 Should i have more than one "Admin" account? RDS admin, Hyper-V admin, FileServer admin etc? 
  
I get on teams to only give permnission to perform the tasks required etc. I find it harder to work out thge balance of security and practicality for a single SysAdmin

 You may ask, why don't you just use app-passthrough? Some apps and vdirs use a UNC path to a share for their home directories and app passthrough won't work for not only those, but for the parents of those vdirs and apps.
 Our IIS configs have several root/parent apps and under those we have about a three dozen child apps and vdirs. About a half dozen app pools to silo worker processes for different apps and sites (balancing between performance and isolated memory space).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a lot of udld issues recently, some which only take one uplink down but others that take both links down. Results in needing to physical go around and console or reboot switches to get them back online.
 These issues occur during some distro switch upgrades or the other day when we had a switch have a bug. So no true lasting unidirectional links.
 Would like to have autorecovery of the errdisabled state but concerned about any potential impact of a udld event that lasts more than a few minutes and results in bringing a unidirectionally link online and it causing a problem before the udld timers shut it down.
 Using rpvst which usually converges in a few seconds but my understanding is that since both sides cannot detect bpdu that it would revert to basic stp timers of 30-50 seconds. Any downsides to bringing a unidrectional link back up with recovery? Would spanning tree timers prevent an actual issue?

 User was having a problem with their dock today, so I asked them on Teams, “please send me a picture of your dick”
 Didn’t hear back for a few hours, but noticed the user is still online. Went back and looked at the message I sent…
 I’m not sure what happens now, but I think I’m either getting into a relationship, or getting fired and sued. 
 Definitely Friday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to design a flyaway rack that is going to highly remote locations to support up to 35 work stations (predominantly on wifi). I want to deploy 4 starlink dishes (we have the business dish) and combine them into one switch which has a number of APS on them.
 My main sticking point is what I use to load balance the 4 starlink networks. I have not got any experience doing this and need some advice on hardware solutions for this.
 Thanks
 Edit - I so far have:
 Starlink, Dream Machine Pro, 4 APS, Ups.
 All is configured and works well, I just need to add more network capacity and we have calculated that 3-4 Starlinks will do the trick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I set up 2 CRS305 switches a few years ago and I recall testing file transfers then and I was getting 800-900MBs with large VM files.
 Not sure if it was the cause but a few weeks ago I upgraded to the newest RouterOS firmware.
 While still in the RouterOS I also upgraded the RouterBOARD fireware to 6.49.7.
 I've tried switching to the switch SwOS and updated the SwOS version to 2.13 but it did not help.
 Not sure if it means anything but the main switch got stuck a few times when switching to the SwOS. Power cycle did not work. I had the same IP address in both configs but ended up using the reset button after the power was back. It did the same thing when trying to update the SwOS firmware. ???
 I have a simple setup with a few workstations and a laptop. They have very fast SSDs that can copy to each other in the same workstation at around 4-5GBs and to themselves at around 1-2GBs.
 I used the /int bridge port print command and all the ports have HW hardware on.
 __________________________________
 I've looked at it a bit more and with workstation1, workstation2 and the laptop all on the same CRS305 switch. Both WS1 and the Laptop get 1.00-1.02GBs and the Windows file copy graph looks flat with only very small dips. Looks really good. But if I copy from the WS1 to the Laptop or the Laptop to WS1 I get around 400-500MBs and it's all over the place.
 WS1 and the Laptop are using Ethernet ports and Ethernet SFP modules on the CRS305 switch. WS2 has Fiber SFP modules. Not sure if that matters.
 ​
 Here is a video copying first on the laptop in the RDP window from WS2, then on WS1 from WS2.
 Then from WS1 to the Laptop and then from the laptop to WS1. The last one, laptop to WS1 is always the slowest to start, it goes up slowly.
 I just don't get how/why copying from WS2 is rock solid on both but then between WS1 and the laptop is so bad.
 All three PCs have SSDs that can read and write over 3GBs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been in networking for almost a decade now. I still enjoy it but what gets me is how much specialized our work is. By that I mean you’re pretty much bound to the brands your company has. You’re going to be a Cisco guy or a checkpoint guy, etc. it’s just frustrating to keep up w these things, and worse if it gets replaced and you sort of start all over again and learn how this “new” tech is implemented differently 
 I guess my question is, what would be a worthwhile networking career path that’s the most vendor agnostic? I’m thinking python/automation but I’m not really up to date w what else is out there.

 I've checked the Certificate Propagation service and its running correctly (to my knowledge). Kind of at a loss on how to continue troubleshooting this since there seems to be no errors associated with it that I've found. Has anyone ran into this problem?

 I wanted to start a discussion on the topic of whether customers need Web Application Firewalls to protect their Web (SaaS) applications. We are large educational institution
 I understand with SaaS model, the responsibility for securing the underlying infrastructure and platform lies with the service provider, while the customer is responsible for securing their own data and access.
 But sometimes customer needs to put additional security measures such as WAF to prevent from threats like DDoS attacks.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences regarding this topic What do you to protect Web SaaS apps.

 We found out yesterday he is actually leaving for the new gig in a little less than 2 WEEKS. I got 5 projects that haven’t even really been started yet dropped on me and a bunch of meetings to follow them up. I was already still getting used to the environment and now this has just put me in a very anxious spot, feeling imposter syndrome hardcore now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Adobe Acrobat Pro license cost for business jumped from around $16.99 to $23.99 USD.
 That is a $8 USD bump.
 Which is an approximate 41% price increase.
 Of course trying to pay for an annual license yields no discount either.
 To justify the increase, they said this:
 *Why is the price increasing? Adobe Acrobat Pro has improved significantly over the last few years with the addition of many new features, including:
 Liquid mode, which automatically reformats text, images, and tables for quick navigation and consumption on small screens.
 Integrations with Google Suite, Box, and Microsoft that enable customers to collaborate and make changes to PDFs directly from Microsoft Teams.
 Expansion to new surfaces that allow customers to access our PDF tools on the web and mobile.
 New e-signature features that streamline workflows and eliminate the need for in-person and “wet” signatures that can slow business down.*
 Reason 1 and 3 should not have been used as a reason. That is like saying, we changed the template on our website to HTML5 and it should look okay now on your phone.
 So at what point does the price gouging stop? It seems like were being charged for common updates.
 The e-signatures, I can understand. Fighting DocuSign. DocuSign can lick my butt. But something tells me this will be removed in the future from the Pro license and used as an add-on service. Like the way Microsoft tells you, any person can call in to your Teams meeting. But you need a conference bridge, and only after you pay for the conference license of $2.50 per user. That pools your minutes together. Which can be chewed up by just a single user who mistakenly uses the call me at this number feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 hoping someone might be able to offer some advice....
 we are looking at standardising our Windows 10 start menu, nothing major, just certain apps pinned to start under folders. This works fine.
 If we then follow M$' guide on adding the taskbar layout to the same xml file, it breaks the startmenu layout and ignores the taskbar changes.
 if we take the taskbar section out, all works again as it should.
 using GPO, we copy the layoutmodification.xml to the default user profile, and also to a local folder (c:\scripts), without the taskbar settings it works fine, but with them in it all stops working, so new users get a startmenu with no items pinned and the default taskbar.
 ​

 the XML file with the taskbar settings, looks like this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started as the local IT support for a medium-sized manufacturer. Their environment has no structure that I can see, or at least it's very limited (a few VLANS and a domain). I'm new to running the show, and I would greatly appreciate any advice on where to begin to try to get this place in order.
 Most of the machines are on Windows 11 right now, with some of the servers on 2012 and some I'm not even sure of. We have a handful of legacy applications which require some *really* old software to run, and I'm hoping to sandbox all of that in a VM eventually.
 We have multiple different backup solutions, some of them local and some of them are cloud-based. All of that is automated already.
 I'm working on a hardware inventory, as what we had was woefully inadequate and so I'm not actually 100% certain of what's present beyond what I can walk around and see.
 Our server room is unsecured; Anyone can just walk right in with no fob and no swipe.
 We do have a corporate help desk from the company that purchased this location, but they primarily just manage purchasing decisions and provisioning.
 So, again, in terms of where to begin, right now I have my eyes firmly on the security of our server room and the hardware inventory, followed by getting hosts on some kind of naming convention and then the same for users... I'm sure there are a hundred more important things I could and should be thinking about, so please do feel free to shout at me what you think those are.
 ​
 Thank you!

 This module will be taught over a ten week period with a one-hour lecture per week, switching to a more practical format later in the term. The professor is quite familiar with Linux and distributed computing, but is currently still outlining the module and taking suggestions;
 This is a final year module in a bachelors degree in computer science, and students should be somewhat familiar with Linux by this point. What type of content would you recommend in a module like this?

 We will be using only one router/firewall, 15 switches distributed in 11 racks (a few stacked switches), 80 APs... Do we need OSPF? And as for PIM, we might be using multicast for the video surveillance system...
 No linked sites.... From another thread:
  
OSPF will make sense only if you have 2 links to and from the site. Even then I would recommend making it a totally stub site just to optimise the routing table.

 Now, depending on MAC inside each of those vlans I need to put this MAC in vlan 3 or 4.
 From what I read, for MAC-based vlan input needs to be untagged.
 Is my only option to bridge those 10 vlans (I don't need them separate, I just receive them like that form outside) then put this bridge on access an loop it to another port with MAC-based VLAN enabled?

 Looking for a direction to make a self organizing network that can handle dynamic multiple gateways.
 Imagine when a group of friends get together their phones would talk, confirm which has the best 5G service and all use that.
 or If no 5G, the next best available.
 and if one of them has run out of data for the month, can use any of their connection.
 (yes, ignoring security and all that. these would all be sharing on purpose and with full knowledge of the owners/users/etc/etc)
 I don't imagine phones being able to do it, but is there a routing protocol that can handle dynamic gateway selection along with path selection?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 In advance I would like to thank anyone who has any thoughts on this.
 I've been pulling my hair out unable to fix it. But I'm no Azure admin, when it comes to troubleshooting. Just a guy doing his best.
 We have 6 users onboarded onto a file share in Azure files. They access it from onsite/wherever they are. The storage account itself is "StorageV2 (general purpose v2)" "Hot Tier".
 The files stored in here are company Excel files. Some of these files are able to get into excess of 50-100MB. With lots of links, formulas, etc.
 The issue that is occurring seems primarily occur when accessing files larger then 1 or 2 MB.
 The issue being that when a larger excel file is accessed the windows file explorer (explorer.exe) will hang. Sometimes it will return to function within seconds, but it generally needs to be closed via task manager. 
 It is replicable on multiple computers, so I do not think it is a local issue, and occurs both offsite on home internet, on onsite on our guaranteed 1000/1000 link, I had begun to think it was an IOPS issue but I can't find any reports on throttling in the azure monitoring.
 I am at a bit of a loss of where to go to from here, view the process and what it is waiting on in task manager when it is hanging gives me "one or more thread of explorer.exe are waiting to finish network I/O" as if explorer.exe has stopped communicating to the internet, but the file will finish downloading and launch. still.
 I am just absolutely confounded. If anyone has any ideas or could point in the right direction of some information to check out, I would be eternally grateful.

The area I'm working with is about 200 feet and on the edge of it one of the businesses has volunteered their internet connection.
 Last year there were problems with connectivity, people are made of meat and water and the signal wouldn't reach well during peak hours. Also there are just enough people that cell signals get jammed up, so it looks like a hotspot is out. We want to make sure that the square readers stay working. 
 Here's what I'm thinking: I have a Linkstar I've been messing around with for shit and grins. Get a cheap point to point pair of antennas to go from the building with internet to a high spot above the beer garden and into to the linkstar. From there get a few fire tablets, reflash the firmware to get rid of the ads, and boom. 
 This is all on a budget, I'll probably go out of pocket on it since it's a non-profit thing. Is this the right way to go about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are your thoughts on what makes a good network document? How about a good diagram? What makes you look at a document and be like "damn THAT's a good document. I want my docs to look like that."
 Any standard outline you follow? How much detail do you put in versus assume that the reader should know the information?
 I'm in a very sad situation where I am forced to use power point as a technical knowledge dissemination tool, whereas a technical white paper would be more appropriate delivery mechanism. There's just too much information to fit into the slides, and the people reviewing these slides are not all network engineers/architects. (I normally write with markdown and asciidoc and convert to PDF)
 I've brought this matter up with the management, but they insist on using power point. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
 I've tried to scope the slides, by stating which slides are primarily intended for a more technical audience versus just a general one, however the problem is less-technical management loves to interject with their questions when they come across content they don't understand.
 Others want to just take my slide deck, be able to look at some bullet points and get a basic idea, yet still be briefed on finer details of a design. It's hard to find a balance.
 To me, power point is a visual aide for me to deliver a presentation, and a guide on where to get more detailed information. Not a zero to hero manual.

 Recently, my company shifted to a new company, and everything has been so hectic. We're about 3 months into the new company, and we still don't have a defined on-call policy. My management has been making up rules on the fly as we go, and it's really starting to get to us. We went from being restricted, to no restrictions and a loose "1-2 hour response time". Instead of standby, they were doing block hours, where ticket = 2 hour pay, but as of today they've taken that away. We've been told that our overtime for on-call is basically just "whatever we worked". Except, we've been told that we still need to look at tickets (we get texts for urgent tickets), but we need to decide if we'll respond or not. If…]]></summary>

 It's definitely GPO related as the event viewer>store> operational, states that it has been blocked by policy (Event ID 4), show error page. 
 All settings in the GPO relating to the store seem correct, but i did find the following in gpresults reporting... @(Microsoft.WindowsStore11606.1001.39.0_x64_8wekyb3d8bbwe?ms-resource://Microsoft.WindowsStore/Resources/StoreTitle) This rule might contain some elements that can not be interpreted by the current version of GPMC reporting module.
 Anyone run into this recently, or have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got laid off today due to restructuring in the company. 
 I told my staffing agency. They felt sympathetic and will do what they can to find me another job.
 I’ve been getting interviews, with startups, mid size corporations and even Amazon. Some of these manage to go past the initial phone screen and to the hiring manager. I even had one where I talked to an executive. 
 What am I doing wrong? Is it due to the market? I admit that I know Azure, AD, Office 365 and have used Windows server but don’t have advanced knowledge, especially of server backups. I have 2 years of work experience, a Business IT Management degree and am studying for Network plus (which I have failed many times before sadly)
 How can I conduct myself in interviews better? I do dress up in an office shirt with a tie.
 I am in NYC, which is very competitive, like many other cities.
 How quickly do people get rehired after layoffs? Will a staffing agency help you find another position?

There are times of heavy data transfers of 1TB or more and regular transfers of ~50GB+.
 I’m thinking a minimum 24-port switch, which will allow for future expansion. I’m looking for suggestions on a switch, that will probably need to be managed for possible future VLAN setup. Please let me know what you’d implement and what you’d avoid. While I will likely have the support of the IT department, this will likely be managed locally by me, with some networking (and learning more rapidly) knowledge. Thanks in advance!

The previous manager left before I started, so I had to feel my way through the company structure without a guide, or documentation. 
 Today, while the exec director (my supervisor) is out on vacation, she called me into her office and asked me to set her up to access the documents on his desktop. Why not. Idgaf. 
 So I opened explorer and \CompName\c$ and boom she was in. No pw authentication prompt. I checked AD and she's a freaking domain admin. 
 I was warned she had control issues, but that's just bonkers. To put the entire company's security at risk just for power that you don't know how to wield is a sign of some deep issues. Any anxiety I had is out the window. It's like seeing someone naked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Covered previously here. 
 In 2020 the VP of Engineering left and tried to elevate me to the lead Tech Lead on top of the other Tech Leads sitting on top of Engineering. Since he was leaving, though, as well as the IT Director, I feared they would put me in charge of all of IT if I accepted, so I suggested a peer structure for the tech leads, which is what we went with.
 Fast forward a year and the interim IT Director leaves and they don’t replace him. Fast forward another year and they ask me to be the Director of IT as discussed in that previous post. I assessed what was needed, recommended they hire a director of IT with experience in IT management and tried to move on.
 A couple of months later they asked me to take over some temporary IT responsibilities while the main IT person was on vacation. A few months later they ask me to manage him. 🤦‍♂️ I again reiterated that they should hire an IT Director and that I would prefer to stay in software development, managing engineers.
 A couple of months later they laid me off as some in the previous thread predicted.
 I suppose the lesson in there could be to just do whatever job they ask you to do and suck it up, but the lesson to me is that I had it sniffed out for 3 years earlier where this was all headed. They wanted a Director of IT on the cheap and without listening to the recommendations of their own staff.
 It's still burning me up when I think about it. I was functionally doing the job before being laid off. I just didn't agree to it being permanent.

 Any idea what's going on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to life and reasons, at 59, I'm trying to find an IT job after a long time away.
 Twenty years ago I worked in IT; my last job was VB programming and AS/400 MS-SQL integration. Since then I've been a stay-at-home dad, with a homelab. I've also developed some electronics skills and been interested in microcontrollers, etc. I've been into Linux since the 90s. I know I have the skills necessary to be a competent asset to an IT department.
 I've been applying online, and about half the time I'm told my application's been viewed more than once, but I've yet to receive any responses beyond that. I'm usually only applying to system or network admin jobs, seeing as the engineering jobs usually want college; I have no degree.
 Should I be trying to find a really small, 1-2, person IT department and give up on the bigger corporate places? I live in metro Detroit. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I recently took over a new network and we have been asked to reduce cost across the board including our SDWAN. Currently we use an MSP with Velocloud devices. We pay ~$1000/month on average per branch for the Velocloud managed-service. Most of our branches are very small ~5 users, leveraging Velocloud Edge510. We have ~20 sites.
 I have a couple of questions:
  
Can Velocloud devices be customer-managed? (wondering if we can save by removing managed services)
 Does anyone have good experience with any other lower cost "branch router" options that have simplified/central management? It doesn't have to be SDWAN necessarily but if it is SDWAN, we are looking for an SDWAN that can be customer-managed so that the cost is lower.
  
Thanks.
 Edit:
  
Just found the $1000/month average was skewed by mid/large sites. My apologies for the confusion!
 The correct average cost for small sites with Velocloud Edge510 (with 30Mbps throughput) is around ~$200/month per site, this includes hardware device(s), license and managed-service (it's a bit lower for sites with a single VCE router and higher for sites with dual VCE routers).
 Based on the comments this appears to be a more reasonable cost for the small sites though it's still good to see what others are using or recommending for lower cost alternatives. Appreciate it!
  
Thanks again!

 My Org has a Microsoft Surface that we keep off of our domain - it goes to trade shows and contains no protected information. However, we pulled it out this year and the password to get into it did not work. Our sales team has locked themselves out of it entirely. There is nothing of major importance on there, but they do want to get into it to pull the stuff that is. 
 It is locked out, and I don't have the option to switch the user to login to the local admin. It is not on our domain, so I can't go through that. I may be explaining this poorly. 
 Is it hopeless to try to get back into it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok I have taken a picture and uploaded it here for my question:
 https://ibb.co/P1dK5Zp
 On the remote logging target page of the ISE server, WHY oh WHY is the only option you can choose for the SSL certificate the ISE will present to the remote syslog server, a "CA" certificate. The ISE is not used as a CA, it's a client/endpoint with its own system certificate, only. It is just a node with its own publically signed SSL cert. Yet, you can litreally only choose a certificate from the trusted source certificate page, which is a page dedicated for Root/Intermediary CA certificates. So the config doesnt make sense. It's like the ISE is saying to the syslog server, Hi syslog server I am some upchain CA server, we good?
 If you read the Cisco ISE documentation in the link below, under the section heading "Configure Secure Syslog Remote Logging Target", it states, step 12:
 "Choose the CA certificate that Cisco ISE must present to the secure syslog server from the Select CA Certificate drop-down list."
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1/b_ISE_admin_31_basic_setup.html
 So you are forced to present a CA certificate, even though we don't use the ISE as a CA server. So how are you supposed to use a a regular system certificate to present itself to the syslog server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's deeply saddening to see all of our favorite products being shifted to a subscription or pay-as-you-go model. Vendors getting greedy with licensing. Nickel and diming customers to death. 
 - Microsoft Office
 - Anti-Virus
 - Servers (cloud, etc)
 - Networking (Meraki and others)
 - Veeam (licensed per-vm now instead of socket-based)
 ​
 are there any vendors left that allow you to buy perpetual licensing? I understand the reasoning for them - continued stream of ongoing revenue. I miss the days where you could buy a product and use it until EOL without yearly subscription fees, aside from maybe warranty/support.
 ​
 What is the future for IT? Subscription workstation hardware? I guess that's technically VDI. Good grief.

 ​
 My organization recently ordered two Dell PowerEdge servers, each with dual CPUs (8c/16t per CPU), and set up a vSphere environment with vCenter. I have made a template for Windows Server 2022 Datacenter and had questions regarding the WS licenses we received. The licenses are "Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (16 CORE)" and we received two product keys per each of the servers. Is there anything I should know if I were to assign these product keys to VMs? I read that the WS22 DC licenses are unlimited use per host compared to the Standard edition. If they are unlimited use, can I use the same product key on each of the servers running VMs? We are attempting to do failover on the servers as well, which is currently set up; we just need VMs now. Also, am I able to add the product key to the template I made and every future VM from that template will be licensed as well?
 ​
 Any insight is appreciated.

Since this is for a different geographic location I figured we should update our list of time servers to include something for the west site so when the east site becomes a smouldering crater everything can still keep running. Redundancy and all that. 
 Our existing domain controllers have 4 time servers already, but they're all in the east. So I hop into a Powershell session on the new DC and hammer out the following:
 w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"server1.domain.com,0x8 server2.domain.com,0x8 server3.domain.com,0x8 server4.domain.com,0x8 server5.domain.com,0x8" /syncfromflags:manual /update 
 I get the message that the command ran successfully. All good right? I go to verify with:
 w32tm /query /peers 
 Bad news. Nothing has changed. It's still the same four time servers that were originally there. 
 I've spent the better part of a week researching and attempting all permutations of the command I can think of to induce literally any change to the list and nothing. I'm throwing in the towel on this one. I need help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been troubleshooting a call center getting "ICE Collection timeout" messages from AWS. They are using AWS connect. So far it's just this one site that has been having these issues and I've been troubleshooting this for about 3 months now along with various network seniors in the company. We've been on calls with AWS and everyone else which brings me now to the minds here at reddit.
 This particular site hasn't been upgraded to Cisco SDWAN yet and is currently running GETVPN. At the beginning of this month we had our ISP (AT&T) Upgrade the links from 100mbps to 250mbps links with no change in ICE errors.
 People who work from home don't see the errors but the vpns they have on the laptops use the split tunneling.
 Yesterday I chatted with the ISP (AT&T) and got reports from them about their links as well as did various tests from our datacenter to the site and everything came back clean. I cleared the counters yesterday at the site as well as rebooted the entire network about a month ago. We really haven't seen anything to indicate a network issue besides call center reporting ICE errors. 
 From the AWS side they've pretty much pointed back at our network.
 So, what are your alls thoughts or questions I could look into to help?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In summary, we have a large organization with more than 400 clinics connected through a s2s VPN. My current project involves identifying all the X-ray machines in our clinics along with their respective models. We have a variety of brands such as ICAT, Planmeca, Vatech, Sirona, Dexis, and more. The success of this project is crucial as any inaccuracies could jeopardize my job. I aim to automate the process, but due to the diverse range of X-ray machine brands in our environment, finding a universal solution is challenging. The operating systems of the devices lack consistency and sufficient detail for a simple network scan. Additionally, not all models provide this information in the registry. The best approach I can think of is to rely on human input, albeit with the potential for human error. I plan to email each clinic manager, requesting the model and serial number of the X-ray machine, or even a picture of it, to ensure comprehensive accuracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I have been asked to get "encryption" set up on emails for users that are sending sensitive information externally and internally. 
 What I have done so far is create a rule inside of exchange that states if the subject has "Encrypt" in it, then apply m365 Message encryption and rights protect message with "Encrypt". This works great when sending to an external email, it forces the recipient to authenticate to view, and allows them to download and view an excel or docx file attached. 
 The issues is internally, if I send a encrypted email to anyone within my domain, they can view the message but not the attachment, it tells them to request permission and that does nothing? I have tried to go into properties of the file and add the domain user but am unable to. I keep reading about IRM settings, but have so far been unable to locate where I can edit those. 
 If there is a better way to go about this whole process, please let me know. 
 Thank you for any guidance you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I started replacing monitors for some users and have had pushback from managers on why I am replacing something that works. They have no issue when we install a new computer, laptop, or keyboard/mouse and those have a shorter replacement schedule. But monitors have been getting pushback. Screens do fade over time, and the newer hardware is generally lighter, thinner, and better connected options. 
 Our schedule is Desktops/Laptops - 4 years, Monitors - 6 years, Network - 6 years, Copiers/Printers - 6 years. All of this is subject to change based on needs or growth, but this is the guide we follow. We have some gear that is a lot older and not been replaced such as monitors that are 8 years old and some printers that are the same age. 
 Curious if I am way off on this or what others have as a replacement schedule?

 What benefit does this have over simply adding the SharePoint folder as a shortcut to their OneDrive?

 I would like to have 2 front-end public dns ha load balancers distributing requests to 4 back-end public dns servers.
 If read that HAProxy can do HA Load Balancing but that’s only for TCP applications. Since DNS mainly runs on UDP is there something similar for it? 
 I’ve tried Nginx proxy setup for UDP and it would work for about 100-200 requests but for public resolutions of 2-5k it can’t handle the load as it doesn’t respond fast enough.

 I'm new as a sysadmin and we're currently changing our ISP. My coworker told me that we need a pool of 4 public IP address for each office we've.
 I asked the reason and he told that we've to split it for security like:
 - Public IP Address for VPN
 - Public IP Address for posting content(webpages, ftp, etc.)
 - Public IP Address for Internet surfing
 Well. As I said, I tried to search for that but I din't found any answer. So do you think guys this is a tipically practice in business ? Or it's a foolishness ? 
 If that's true, how can I get info about that for document myself ?
 Thanks !

 The wholesale broadband provider operates an LAC. I'm trying to understand how you would configure LNS, eBGP etc. Assuming I have only 1 tunnel end point:
  
 Domain Name Tunnel End Point Addresses (/32) 
  
 broadband.example.com 1.1.1.241/32 
 
 And here is my eBGP info:
  
 eBGP Peers (2 Per Resilient Link) 1.1.1.240/30 
  
  1.1.1.244/30 
 
 And address range to eBGP peer mappings:
  
 Address Range (LNS) Corresponding eBGP Peer 
  
 1.1.1.0/24 1.1.1.240/30 
 
 My Questions:
  
Can my tunnel end point address be the same as my eBGP peering address?
 Can my LNS be within the BGP peering range?
  
I may be completely misunderstanding this so if someone could provide a sort of summary of what all this means I'd be grateful. Thanks!

Check the NS records and the primary name server specified in the SOA record to make sure they are valid, internet-facing, name servers hosting your domain's records."
 I also ran MX and NS lookups on whatsmydns.net. Both returned with near zero propagation. (NS is showing resolution in Mexico City, Russia, and Pakistan but nowhere else)
 DNS records are entered correctly in our registrar (domain.com) and have not been recently changed. I chatted with their support and they kept saying “wait 24 hours” and “everything looks good on our end”.
 At this point we’re ready to just switch registrars to stop the bleeding, but I would love any other ideas if y’all have them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK based, currently have ~3 years exp as a solo sys admin for an entirely cloud based (azure + m365) fintech adjacent startup. I quit last November for a 'sabbatical'. My plan was to get the az-104 cert, both as extra evidence I know what I'm doing and so I can fill in knowledge gaps, plus it gave some justification for the sabbatical in interviews.
 Unfortunately I need a new job sooner than expected. I've been studying, but after taking a practice exam... It isn't looking great. Based on my last job I'm confident in my abilities in practice, but the practice exam seemed very based on memorising minutiae instead. While the exam wasn't great, tons of grammar and spelling errors making it hard to parse, I do believe the types of questions are representative.
 I can continue to study but I'll end up going over budget, or I can pause this, start interviewing now without the cert, and hope for the best.
 Do you think there will be a significant difference between my offers with 3 years azure etc experience + 6 months break vs the same but with az-104 picked up in that time? Would mentioning my cert goal and studying help? I have very little interview experience :(
 Tldr: difference in ability to land a good job with or without az-104 after 3 years cloud sysadmin exp, and a break?

 He will be supported by me (~25 years in IT, experienced Windows/Linux/etc engineer), but my background is pretty much all self-taught/on the job. His new employers are happy to put him through a moderate amount of training to get him up to speed and support his growth, but I have no idea what certifications currently offer the most value at this level. MCSE? Comptia? 
 Any suggestions people can offer (and any supporting info they can provide) would be very welcome.

For a bit of background our endpoints are intune managed but most of our apps come from citrix servers which are on prem. We have a sonicwall firewall but its not doing any https inspection and would only cover people in the office anyway.

 I'am a sole Sysadmin in our company with about 250+ users based in Europe. I started around about 1 Year ago there and cleaned up a lot from IT Assets, Processes and Policies short I got some structure in IT there before I was there there were almost nothing just chaos. We are a fully SaaS Company and in general I manage all SaaS tools (Google Workspace, Slack, WorkspaceONE and couple more tools we dont have an Provider like OneLogin but at the end I try to Automate everything to make it a bit easier for me) for our Hardware we are currently 50/50 one half is managed by us the other is managed by our Hardware provider but ofc. I also manage them. Little sub note: all devices that comes from our Hardware Provider are MDM managed all others are getting added by myself step by step you know its pain sometimes to get first all the Users Device Informations (Have to ask them). Since couple months it can get really busy almost max. of my cap thats why I wrote some more policies and telling the users to always using the IT Helpdesk if they have any Questions. Now I had a meeting were they ask me to write down my tasks I did last week and asked my about IT Outsourcing to Support me e.g as Backup when being Sick or on Vacation. I told them yes we can check out but I am not sure if this would be the solution In my opinion we should get another sysadmin there) I 'am also a bit scared about if maybe I get replaced after they Implement the IT Outsourcing since I worked a lot in the company and did a lot changes I would be really sad If something like that would happens.
 ​
 Somehow I feel since the Meeting not quite well, I always think about it. Do you have any tips? atm. I'am on vacation for 4 Days without any Backup.
 ​
 Best regards,
 kpwde

 I think the configuration is correct since I tried with with other devices and are connecting without problems. With W11 I can connect using computer and user account, and with iOS and Android with ad user with no problems.
 I already re-checked NPS policies, check that 802.11r is disabled on APs. W10 clients are on 22H2 so sholud be ok, right? And as I said basically all the other devices are working... 
 In the logs the only I see is error 16 - Authentication failed due to user credentials mismatch, but credentials are right.
 Did anyone face this situation? Thanks.

 I hope I explain well. english is not main language and that's also what makes my internet searches more difficult.
 I am at my wits end here with a legacy software that we want to use through RDP on some older Datalogic Skorpio (x3 and x4) 
 The problem is when creating new users:
 the user is added to several groups, most importantly group that autoexec c:\myapp\launcher.exe
 (through the GPO "Start a program on connection")
 our launcher then allows to start other apps they need, one of them doesn't work right away tho
 it's an old 3rd party (obsolete, but will require a couple years to phase out) that requires some cache temporary folders in c:\users\user\appdata
 this folder doesn't exist when creating a new user and with the GPO "Start a program on connection" apparently is not created properly
 THE WORKAROUND: the workaround is to remove the user from the "autoexec" for aa few minutes, log in manually to that user so windows creates those folders upon first login, then add the user back to the "autoexec" GPO and now everything works
 ​
 so, when logging in manual once, %appdata% cache folders are created properly (with proper persmissions) but when the GPO "Start a program on connection" is enabled from the very beginning, it doesn't work
 we don't have remote folders or any of that.
 is there a way to solve this so we don't have to log into the user manually without autoexec every time we make a new user?

 We are experiencing issues with a bunch of machines reverting their Version of Win10. It could be something else but as far as we found out, if one of our AD-Admins logs in to a computer where a normal User was logged in, the Win10 Version get's downgraded to Win10 Pro from Enterprise. Not a big deal at the moment but in our reports we're having like 100 Pro Versions now where there should be a solid 6k Enterprise. Funny thing is, when the User logs back in to his PC it takes ages to get it back to Enterprise by himself or the Azure Sync.
 Our Users have an MS E3 license. Admins don't have a license as of now. 
 We already had a MS Ticket open and they provided us with the solution to just run a PS-script but we are still searching for the root cause to eliminate that. 
 If we run slmgr /dlv we can see in the script host window that it's Win10 Pro and licensed but on the Win10 settings pane it says Win10 Enterprise, which is also strange.
 Anyone else having such issues? Or similar things? Have to be honest that the AD-Admin Accounts are just our first guess.

 maybe you can assist me :)
 i have 1 Remote Desktop Server (Win 2022) and 10 Users. There is only 1 Workstation.
 the single Workstation will be used hourly bi other people. so my plan/wish is:
 ​
  
User 1 goes to workstation, put in his smart card (as example an yubikey)
 Remote Desktop will automatically start and require the PIN from the User 1
 Session Start....
 If the User unplug the SmartCard, RDP Session close (user still logged in)
 User 2 goes to workstation...
 ...
  
i was able to set up this scenario for the most part with yubico:
 https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013707820-YubiKey-Smart-Card-Deployment-Guide
 but this is not 100% user (and admin) friendly, i'm not able to autostart rdp on plugin yubikey, sometimes i have to change from user/pw to smartcard manually. on unplug yubikey an error message (from mstsc.exe) appears...
 is there an company / tool who can handle this scenario? do you know an "all in one" solution for this? i believe there must be many company's (hospitals, retirement home's etc.) which work similarly to this...
 thanks a lot :)
 edit:
 - all on prem, azure ad is available...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been contacted by someone in my company who runs an automated web scrape to gather names, URLs and contact details related to a particular project.
 They are finding that a very small percentage of URLs look legit but redirect to NSFW sites. The datasets are large so the URLs can't all be manually checked. Is there a service that can access a potentially large list of URLs, check where they are redirected to, and flag if the site redirected to is NSFW or hosts malware?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probably very basic for y'all, but I need your inputs if there is a better way to do this.
 As the title said, we have 2 separate networks.
 Each have their own firewall/router.
 Each network have their own ISP.
 How to use the ISP of the other network as backup internet in case main internet goes down?
 (Sometimes will use the backup internet while main internet is still active, but not all the time) 
 Kindly refer to the images below.
 This is basically my question:
 The_Problem 
 This is my initial Plan:
 Is_this_a_Stupid_Idea? 
 I can't wrap my head around this.
 ISP Modems using PPPoE so I can't directly connect the other Network's firewall to it.
 So I guess I have to put something in between the ISP Modem and the firewalls, to do the NAT.
 But it feels like it just adds to latency and more devices, plus more point of failures.
 I feel like there is a better way. 
 Hope somebody can suggest. Don't flame me. :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few team members regularly take notes in notepad as .txt files. These are often scratch notes that never get turned into process documentation even though they should. 
 Others use a bland looking Word document template. 
 We have a file share and a SharePoint Wiki that just acts as a second repository for our documents. Seriously, we dump .docxs and .pdfs into both places and hope someone will see them. 
 Not everything feels like it should be in a Word document. If I'm ever writing some CLI syntax, word just feels wrong. If I'm writing configurations out as part of a process of provisioning template, word feels wrong. I like Markdown a lot, but I don't have a good way to share these files or make them collaborative. They also don't have a lot of theming or "pretty" features to them, which can be seen as a upside and downside. 
 How can I, without becoming our "documentation person", improve how my team documents things? Right now, people either document things poorly, or not at all because we just don't have any good methods of documenting things. Nobody has ever seemingly taken the time to improve how we document.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I would like to understand what the pure theoretical way to use different bands would work. 
 If I have a single large room, and at each end is an AP. I have users with PC/laptop/phone that want maximum speed (Wireless AC/AX). I have smart devices in the area, that just need a tiny message to start and stop (Wireless N). 
 In regards to best radio interference, theory. What would be the best config? 
 Can I set the N to 20Ghz. Then tell the AC/AX to use only the 40/50Ghz range, not 20? 
 Would that be the pro way to set up a simple system? Thanks for any tips. Cheers.

 If I ping externally to 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 /Google.com /bbc.com, second ping is a DUP!, I have done a packet capture on the LAN interface of the firewall.
 No. Time Source Destination Protocol Length Info
 1 0.000000 172.16.4.5 8.8.8.8 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request id=0x0002, seq=1/256, ttl=63 (no response found!)
 2 0.000060 172.16.4.5 8.8.8.8 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request id=0x0002, seq=1/256, ttl=63 (reply in 3)
 3 0.003472 8.8.8.8 172.16.4.5 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) reply id=0x0002, seq=1/256, ttl=117 (request in 2)
 4 0.003578 8.8.8.8 172.16.4.5 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) reply id=0x0002, seq=1/256, ttl=117
 Then the process repeats, I'm note sure I'm reading this right but it looks to me that the fist ping does not respond in time so it sends a second then the first one responds then followed by the second and that is seen as a DUP!.
 I have built a clean raw install of Ubuntu 22.04 (i think) on a different ESXi host and date store, but it does the same after first login and is still doing it after the system is upgraded.
 There are no duplicate MAC addresses on the VMWare.
 There are no Duplicate IPs in use
 My next step is to install Ubuntu to a laptop and hardwire it to the network on the same VLAN.
 Can anyone make any other suggestions that would help diagnose this issue.
 Thanks Simon

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a standard 19" 42U server rack with EIA square holes.
 Some of my mounting rails with 10-32 threaded holes are meant to be screwed directly into the square holes. The rail sits flush on the rear face of the post and the screw goes directly into the threaded hole from the front, no cage nut, right through the square opening.
 They came with these 10-32 screws with a low profile flat head (the shape, not the socket) and a wide diameter head to cover up most of the square hole and provide a secure fit.
 The manufacture doesn't sell any extras, and when I search for 10-32 server rack screws, I just get a bunch of regular ones with big domed heads. I need them to sit as flush as possible to the mounting posts.
 Is there a specific name for this style of screw, and are they readily available from common suppliers like CDW for example?
 Thanks in advance.
 ps. In general, just buying new mounting rails while it is the obvious solution, is not possible in this situation, I'm an academic researcher and I can't really allocate funds for something that has already been done, especially when it still works. I just need some more screws.
 Edit: Thank you to u/St0nywall for figuring out I needed some 1421 mounting hardware by hammond. Life saver.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys!
 I have had multiple attempts on establishing a L2L IPsec tunnel using certs that I installed on both ASA firewalls using NDES SCEP from a Windows Server 2019 AD CS VM. The certs are RSA 2048 based with SHA 512 signature. I tried both IKEv1 and IKEv2, the tunnels work perfectly if I switch to PSK, but when I use certs, for example with IKEv2, it gets stuck in IKE_AUTH step. FW1 sends the fragmented cert to FW2 and FW2 sends a response and then after a few seconds they start negotiating again.
 If you guys need wireshark captures or configurations, let me know. I also tried both policy based and route based tunneling using VTI, same result.
 Thanks.

 I provided some evidence to remove a vulnerability found and the support team warned us that any “HTTPS exposure” coming from the SonicWALL is on the radar of insurance carriers as a potentially uninsurable asset. The recommendation is to move to an alternative firewall solution such as Cisco, Cloudflare, etc. 
 Anybody have any insight on why this is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a university and we have an newer outdoor athletics facility that has fiber ran to each corner of the facility. The boxes are built into the ground so that they're inconspicuous. The issue is that each winter they fill up with water, it ruins the GFI switches to the power inside and the fiber that comes into a second smaller box located inside still gets filled with water and gets dirty. They were barely able to host the event this year due to this issue but it's been a recurring problem for the 3 years the facility has been built. 
 So my understanding of the setup is: fiber from a pressbox to a subterranean enclosure, fiber goes into that box into a smaller grey box that does something I don't understand, we then bring a switch that we keep inside a pelican case over and plug the fiber from the small grey box inside the subterranean enclosure into the switch, then all the necessary devices plug into the switch using ethernet. The water is getting into the small grey box and breaking things each winter.
 I don't know enough about networking to hold an eduacated converstation on the topic with you all but I just got out of a meeting with some people that presented me with a solution to this issue that I didn't like. They admitted they don't know how other places do it so we're all kinda hunting for solutions to this issue. They want something above ground but since it's an athletics facility that would require a box right on the edge of a playing field which presents competitive, asthetic and safety concerns. 
 Is there a box or setup of some kind that can be left in an underground enclosure that would be able to stay dry for a number of years? I asked if there wasn't a way to cap the fiber cable coming into the subterranean enclosure with a cap that was waterproof then just bring the boxes and switches for the events each time but they said there's no cap that would keep it clean enough. 
 Any thoughts or solutions would be appreciated!

 Even now, I still see Drobo devices still in use on occasion. I'd look at finding a replacement whenever possible, just because their BayondRAID format is not open, and if the enclosure dies, it will take sending the data to OnTrack to recover it.
 Ages ago, they were an innovative company, where RAID on the desktop was a useful thing. However, they never really made anything big after that, other than an iSCSI target, and eventually NAS models. Synology and QNAP eventually ate their lunch.
 In any case, time to decommission any Drobo storage appliances in use.
 Edited: This includes Retrospect, so if one is using Retrospect for backups, time to find a VAR and find a replacement ASAP.

Then we use a fucking old version of Navision to report our time, it's slow and clunky. 
 Some days we are extremely busy so we don't have enough time to report everything we do, then next month comes, higher-ups see the numbers and say "you've reported nothing! You didn't work at all this month" yeah of course asshole I spent more time actually working instead of trying to show you that I do work.

The issue is that the R733 wants ~10vdc off-hook and the D-Link device only provides 8vdc(tested with multimeter). According to some research the R733 is pretty sensitive about voltage so it has to be pretty close to 10v for it to work.
 Is there any sort of solution that would provide the 10vdc off-hook that it needs without replacing either the emergency phone or the cellular device? We need to stick with US Cellular because we don't want to open an account with another provider. If we did need to replace the emergency phone, are there options that would work with 8vdc? We have power in the location it is going so something that requires additional power is possible as well.

 I'm doing a lab on OSPF, BGP, VXLAN, IPv4 and IPv6 eve-ng.
 I have 2 geographically distant DCs connected via peer BGP with 2 ISPs.
 My idea is to configure VXLAN between the 2 DCs so that overlay customers can travel in their networks transparently, as if they were "Regions", as it is in the public cloud.
 Speaking of IPv4, I don't see a problem, because the customer's network IPv4 is a non-routable IP on the internet, so I have 1 gateway in the customer's network on each DC.
 My question is about IPv6, which is a routable IP...
 Well... basically I want to connect two IPv4 and IPv6 overlay networks of geographically separated DCs.
 I would like to talk about this issue, as many of you work with these technologies on a day-to-day basis, so I wanted to learn a little more about it.
 I couldn't put the eve-ng topology image here, so the link is below:

 Curious to how you are managing users such as devs that need local admin to do their jobs effectively?
 Read about each dev machine having their own "dev vm" environment where they are full admins and other similar segregation methods.
 We are doing some Cyber security certs at the moment and I need to prove people aren't using admin accounts with access to the internet or email and I'm struggling to fathom how to manage 30 devs when there's only me as the primary IT resource. 
 I use Intune to manage all workstations.

 I have raised this concern and it hasn’t been taken seriously. I think the email signatures are being centralized on Microsoft 365 and will not be in anyone’s control except for IT.
 Is there a way to get around using something like that or what? Is it just automatically applied to every email and you can’t do anything?

 My question is, what can i do, to allow this miniature computer with the incorrect static IP addresses to regain internet access so that i can configure it online.
 ​
 Would connecting it to another computer with internet connection and bridge the ethernet port to the wireless ethernet enable the miniature computer to regain internet access?

Sounds good on paper but this process has gone unchecked for many years and now users have 20+ shared mailboxes each.
 This is causing outlook to constantly break (a man can only make so many new outlook profiles) as they are trying to use it as a CRM tool. 
 I have not got enough authority to implement a CRM so my question is this: What are some alternative solutions to this problem? 
 I have though about each team having a shared mailbox, with an alias for each of their respective customers. As well as caching only 6 months emails to help aleviate the strain on .psts.
 Another option would be adding members but disabling auto-mapping off, forwarding all emails into a team mailbox and the users then simply change who they are sending as.
 Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

 ​
 While testing an update from PDF24 Creator (9.x to 11.12.0) I found out that the registry paths has changed (as written in their documentation). This leads to missing printers in PDF24 Creator although they are shown as local installed printers.
 But the printers aren't working.
 ​
 I searched the web for a solution to keep the printers after updating but found nothing at all.
 Therefore I post this solution so anyone who didn't do that update because of this behavior can update now without reinstalling the printers.
 ​
  
open regedit.exe as admin
 search for HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\PDFPrinter\Serviceshere are all PDF printers - each one got a folder (i.e. 1A2B34CDEZ)
 right click the folder and export it as .reg
 edit the exported .reg with notepad
 change the key pathfrom HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\PDFPrinter\Services\1A2B34CDEZto HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PDF24\Services\1A2B34CDEZ
 install the new version (auto deploy, manually, whatever) and reboot afterwards
 open regedit.exe as admin -> Data -> import -> import .reg files
 reboot your device
 open PDF24 creator settings -> printers -> printers must be shown now and working properly
  
​
 It is that easy.
 ​
 Could be working for automation as well - I didn't try it for the few devices.
 ​
 Best wishes

Created the port profiles, the logical switch and logical networks through SCVMM. Placed a test VM on the cluster, made it high available and when powering on it triggered a blue screen on the host. Then the 2nd host noticed host nr1 is down and took over the VM, tried to power it on and then also BSODed. Then host nr 3 took over and also BSODed, etc, etc....
 The BSOD screens al show vmswitch.sys as the cause of the BSOD. We're using Cisco blades and firmware / drivers are all at the level requested by Cisco. Windows 2022 is a fresh install with all the latest updates applied.
 My guess is maybe the UCS policy for the nics is not correct. VMQ settings? RSS? RSC? And this causing a BSOD because a conflict in settings???? 
 Can't find any Cisco docs about specifically Windows 2022 Server Hyper-V on UCS.
 Any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the subject says... but with a bit more detail. I'm looking for recommendations on:
  
Simple monitoring solution that can be installed on Linux
 Can be configured to monitor SNMP hosts
 Can import vendor specific MIB files (probably should go without having to say)
 Everything about the install/configure can be downloaded and installed in an air-gapped network (ie. packages, docker images, ova's, etc)
 Email alerting
  
There's lots of options out there for sure, Cacti, Nagios, LibreNMS, Zabbix, etc... I just need to quickly get something stood up that can start recording sensor (temp/power/fanspeed) values of some of our server hardware equipment.
 Bonus points if it can also be configured as a syslog server to be able to record and alert on activity logs.
 I know it's a long shot but I figured I'd ask what folks are using.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been offered a sysadmin job at a small company where I would be the only IT/sysadmin person. My skills are more in software engineering, but the job was offered to me and thought I'd take it. The company heavily relies on Azure and the M365 suite for most things including MDM, but even with all of that functionality, there are 30+ applications/software/systems external to the M365 suite that I have to learn how to use and offer support for. I recently found out that the person who is currently the sysadmin is leaving probably a week after I join and has to pass all this knowledge on to me in that time, which I already know isn't going to happen. Personally , it's an immense amount of pressure on me being the only person who would have the role of a IT Technician/Sysadmin, especially when someone comes to you with a problem and lurks over you as they expect you to fix it there and then. Any suggestions on what I can do to make my life easier when starting this role and relieve some of the pressure? This is my first sysadmin job, not a massive noob, but I do lack experience though. Thanks :D

 I have a backup file of a server that I want to perform a checkdisk on.
 Now before I do that, because it holds valuable data, I was wondering what the best practice would be for creating a backup/local copy of that backup file.
 Is it safe to just use windows copy and paste or robocopy? Or is there a better way to copy that file? 
 Thanks!

In the past this folders never gave this problem. Access is also no problem. Today we noticed that a couple of desktop apps that are auto starting on a Windows Server did not start due to an exception (Exception Info: System.UnauthorizedAccessException). Starting the app as Administrator solves the startup. Anybody else seen this behaviour? Ii checked the UAC and that is not causing this.

 We use Cisco firewalls (with ASA OS, not Firepower) mainly for their excellent VPN client, AnyConnect.
 What alternative firewall has the best VPN for end users?
 In sequence of importance we care about the following in a VPN solution:
  
Stability (shouldn't drop the connection at first sign on network trouble)
 Support for 2FA
 Ease of use for end-user
 Ease of pushing new config to client
 Ease of initial installation

 I just came across some errors in the event log stating that a couple of certificates have expired back in 2020 and haven't been renewed automatically. In this case it is on the primary DC holding all FSMO roles etc which is also CA.
 I don't have much experience in this particularfield, so just want to be sure that I don't break anything by just using the certificate renewal wizard to renew it, either with a new key or using the same key? :)

 Such as software you have to download an installer and run it as admin to update.
 You obviously can't trust users to be able to handle this, it's providing an open door to the system.
 At work we're dealing with several peices of software that lacks auto updates across about 400 users. 
 The only solutions we can think of is manually remoting in and updating the software or giving certain members of staff admin access such as managers to run the install.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow sysadmins, I've encountered something rather strange which I haven't yet seen before and I'm unsure on how to resolve it / find the cause. I write this in the hopes that someone can point me in a direction where I might be able to find out more about the issue.
 System is running Windows 10 22H2 build 19045.2965, browser is Firefox v113.
 To the issue itself:
 When I try and reach https://www.\[domainname\].com it gives me an error and says "Access Denied" "You don't have permission to access "http://www.\[domainname\].com/" on this server."
 Which I find highly suspicious because being redirected to an http site might pose an security risk, which is why I believe the client/DNS cache and thus the system itself might be compromised... It's only this one specific site that yields the issue.
 Have any of you encountered something like this? I've disabled all the browser's addons, but to no avail. Just ran in-depth malware check on the system, but it yielded no detection at all...
 Any ideas what to do next/what to look for?

 Do any of you have favorite or useful tools for this type of planning? I don't need actual project management tools as things like dates or timelines are a bit premature at this point. I feel something like a Gantt chart without the timeline would be helpful--just tracking dependencies and breaking things into subtasks.

 I am facing a (hopefully solvable) problem, as I cannot directly influence some things. The following situation:
 Domain A is managed by DFN. The web server for domain A was provided by my employer. Due to lack of staff, web server provisioning has been discontinued. We received a backup before the shutdown. The administration of domain A should remain with DFN.
 We then purchased Domain B from STRATO, including the web server. There we imported the backup and made the site available again.
 Domain A is well known by everyone and appears high up in Google. Therefore domain A should be redirected to domain B without an underlying web server. The support at DFN has entered the IP address of the web server of STRATO for domain A, which appears by a ping. However, STRATO can apparently not process this request, so that when the IP is called, simply a "Not found" appears.
 The support at DFN has no idea, and I do not know enough about the subject. He said that this is due to the configuration of the web server at STRATO.
 How do I get the problem solved?
 Thanks :)

IT discovered the reason is when the screen locks, the keyboard layout doesn't default back to English like it normally did but stays at the current language being used. Users' passwords are always "English" since that's what the keybord layout normally defaults on the lock screen. So they keep getting wrong password, until they mouse over to change the layout.
 I tested and it seems to be affecting Windows 10 (22H2) only. Windows 11 works as expected. Anyone else seeing this? All of our users use multiple layouts and it's causing a lot of grief.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 We have an incident with 2 RICOH SP 4510 DN printers because we can't connect on the WEB interface of this one.
 The customer has many other RICOH models and no problem but the problem persists only with these 2 printers of the same model.
 There is no network blocking because the printer / workstations / print server is in the same subnet (We have checked anyway).
 We have updated the firmware of the 2 printers.
 We have reset both printers to factory settings.
 We have contacted RICOH support but they don't help us much.
 We have reset the remote certificates on both printers.
 When we want to access the WEB interface, the error message is "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" as if the printer refused the connection.
 In the Ricoh firmware update software, the error message is "Failed at TLS communication" but there is no blocking at the network level and we can update the Firmware with no problem.
 This happens only with these 2 printers, for all other RICOH it's ok everything works fine.
 In short, we have done everything but nothing to do unfortunately.
 Has anyone had a similar case / can anyone help us with this ?
 Best regards,

In order to “increase security” on this box, the user decided to set both the system and admin passwords … and now has forgotten both. 
 After this machine is reformatted to its initial factory state, I’m going to have to hunt down all these machines and make sure users can’t get into the BIOS. 
 But I’ve never encountered quite this situation before. It used to be you could take out the CMOS battery for 30 seconds or so and the password(s) would be wiped. Not so, apparently, for the 3460. Googling and product manual searches yielded no help, so I’m appealing here for assistance. 
 Any ideas, folks?

Since I joined, my colleagues never liked me (they have been there for 15+ years and expected me to do what they tell me to do rather than working as a team). However, my manager have always been supportive of me and understood the dynamics of how my colleagues would underpin me being the new guy. Now my position became a full time but i have to reapply like all other applicants. Recently my manager hinted that someone else applied internally and he seems to be a good fit as he got along well with my current team and that guy has been referred from top management. And he suggested if I would be okay to continue working for another 1 year contract. I felt bad and hurt as I invested in couple of certs in this job hoping my hard work and my certs would make me a good candidate once the position becomes full time. My manager told me he likes how I am always calm and thoughtful and he told me to think about his plan. I didn’t express my emotions or said anything when he told me this news. Now should I tell him I was hoping to get this full time and hoping to be part of this company growing up the ladder. Or should I just stay silent and start applying elsewhere?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am trying to understand the need to have both on our network. 
 Currently finishing up a network upgrade that included a lot of new things, but some of the main things were adding Cisco ISE for radius and tacacs. Another part is adding wireless to our network for the first time. Wireless is all Aruba and we are using clearpass to authorize wireless clients. APs are all Aruba, and also using AIRwave.
 So basically two AAA servers. One for wireless and one for wired. 
 From my understanding, you can do wireless authentication with ISE though. ISE can authorize your wired and wireless clients, all on one device. 
 Is it really necessary to have both aruba clearpass and Cisco ISE on the network? I asked my boss why have both, and his response was so we don’t have to manually enter client mac addresses, I guess they populate when the person connects to the Wi-Fi and then we can place them into the right vlan. But in my experience, ISE does the same thing with wired clients. They get placed into a dead group not associated with a vlan, and then we can assign them to a group. But usually we have them assigned before they connect. 
 My issue with having two devices for aaa is having to manually enter macs in two different devices. We are a building that hosts a lot of short term guest with lots of BYOD devices. So we are always receiving lists of MAC addresses that get approved and need added into ISE. It can be a pain especially when getting calls because of connection issues then finding out it’s because someone can’t tell the difference between their wireless mac and wired Mac, plus typos and other errors. I just feel it’s unnecessary to have two devices if it can be handled by one. So just wondering if there is a bigger reason why clearpass and ISE are needed that I may be missing?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All, I am currently working on adding an additional GRE tunnel to a cloud vendor with the intention of filtering PC traffic over for inspection. To my knowledge there are two ways I can go about this, see below.
 ​
 Option 1. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with a higher routing priority & distance which would result in the route not being active in the routing table of the Fortigate. Then create policy routes to perform the actual routing. My manager prefers to stay away from policy routes.
 Option 2. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with the same distance & priority. The new route will populate in the active routing table, then create firewall policies around that static route. Please see my concerns below.
 If my Fortigate firewall has a simple LAN > WAN firewall policy and the policy only includes the LAN and WAN1 interfaces and NOT the GRE tunnel inteface. If I add another 0.0.0.0/0 static route (GRE Tunnel) to my routing table with the same distance and priority. Does the Firewall start performing ECMP even though the destination interface is not included with the LAN > WAN policy? I would imagine it might because of the static route being in the active routing table.

 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just got back from 2 weeks vacation, looks like nobody covered my tasks when I was away and I've come back to 30 incidents in my work queue.
 On top of that I've been ringfenced for urgent project work for the rest of he week, and boss has said no excuses this "must be top priority".
 I could:
 A) break my back with extra hours and try and pick off the urgent incidents while doing the project in the day job.
 B) work my regular hours, let SLAs fail and let the world burn.
 I'm going with option B this week, tough love. We have been a person down for 18 months while management say thay can't find the right candidates, we have obliged by covering the holes, but I can't any more - simply not enough hours to fit everything in for the foreseeable. Management have to learn we can't go on!
 Let's hope it's the right choice, because I know complaints will be a coming in.

 Today is the day it happened :) After weeks and weeks (~12 - 16) of reporting fileserver issues and being told "everything is fine only your team reports it and it happened twice now, meh". It became a bigger problem and took down our CRM, SAP and SharePoint for 2 - 3 hours which resulted in slow and terrible analysis roughly 6 weeks ago. Decisions were made, thrown away and then decided again.
 During this time the team I am part of had the main issues because automations took ages / timed out since the FS wasn't always available or slow. 
 Guess what we learned on Friday? We didn't create backups for the main share since end of April! Called in a contractor to go over everything and noticed bad sectors / partition starts corrupting. So tonight was supposed to be a full backup because we cannot risk anything, right???
 Well I told my team lead, who graciously got assigned on-call, that he should be prepared for dead scheduled tasks tomorrow morning or worse. He just send me a message "10 people in a meeting - incl. head of infrastructure. Seemingly the partition died"
 Well why have a call about a dead drive surely we deployed RAID XYZ? About that... Seems like we had 6TB of mission critical files on a single volume that was able to get completely corrupted by a single drive failure :) 
 Sure I knew that most of my coworkers aren't topnotch but how in the devil's name is that possible? I learned that shit in school. Legitimate feel like brushing up the CV if tomorrow turns out the way I think it will.

 being as this is the first time we're/i'm doing this, can you guys fill me in on common and not-so-common things to look out for when implementing bgp? like how long does this outage typically take, common troubleshooting/problem areas, etc. 
 from my very basic understanding, the routes from ISP1 will be advertised to ISP2 and vice versa to create redundancy. these new routes will have to be put in manually by all parties in their respective routers simultaneously. also, we will need a (new) /24 block to do the advertising. that's pretty much the extent of what i know. again, it being the first time bgp-ing i can't help but feel nervous about something that's probably routine to a lot of you here.

 You know you need to modernize, so you go out to hire, but any admins with extensive experience in AzureAD, or whatever greatest trend is going, run the other direction once they learn your infra is SQL 2012R2. Who wants to step into a business 10 years in the past (and deal with the guys still there stuck in their ways)? Good admins want to have good tech.
 So you have outdated infrastructure because you can't hire any admins that have kept their learning going. And you can't hire any modern admins because you have outdated infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking into how my own ISP works. They have transit providers; wholesale downstream ethernet providers and rack space in a single datacenter from what I can see. I think it's something like this:
 Transit ISP ---> Datacenter ---> Wholesale Broadband MPLS Net ---> BRAS ---> DSLAM ---> CPE
 How does IP addressing work in a small tier 2 ISP such as this? Now this may be because of my lack of subnetting knowledge but I'm under the impression that each router interface will have a unique subnet.
 Therefore, would the subnetting look like this assuming there is no hardware redundancy (for simplicity of this example)?
  
 Transit ---> Aggregation Switch A (/30) 
  
 Aggregation Switch ---> Core Router B (/30) 
  Core Router ---> Wholesale Ethernet MPLS C (/30) 
  Customers D (/24) Some form of NAT 
 
 If anyone has a detailed diagram of an ISP that utilizes wholesale broadband MPLS I'd greatly appreciate it. Are customers generally assigned private IP addresses and then NAT is used or how does this work?
 Appreciate any advice or pointers towards resources. Thank you!

 I understand that most of the features are similar but that it is implemented differently, as well as being mostly integrated in Windows now. Any and all information is really appreciated. I know a lot of people have had issues upgrading, luckily, I won't need to experience that.
 I have lots of individual questions, but a guide may answer most of them. Can anybody post your experience and references?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been working in IT doing a mix of sysadmin, Helpdesk, Infrastructure, and cloud-magic for about a decade now. I hate to say it but I've noticed that, maybe starting about 2 years ago, I just don't care about people's IT issues anymore. 
 Over the past decade, all sorts of people come to me with computer issues and questions. Friends, Family, Clients, really just anyone that knows that I "do computers" has come to me for help. It was exhausting and incredibly stressful. So I set up boundaries, over the years the friends/family policy turned into "Do not ask me for any IT help what so ever. I will not help you. There is no amount of money that will make me help you. I do not want to fix your computer, I am not going to fix your computer. I do not care what the issue is, find someone else"
 Clients were a bit different as they are paying me to do IT work. But after so so SO many "Help! When I log in, the printer shows up 10mins late" and "Emergency! The printer is printing in dark grey instead of black ink!!" and general "USB slow, please help, need antivirus" I just honestly don't care either. 
 Honestly, I've noticed I barely use a computer or tech in my free time, because I just don't want to deal with it. 
 Has this happened to anyone else? Am I turning into an asshole? Am I getting burnt out?

 A. Adam copied all files from his PC to a drive he was given by company A B. Adam deleted all company files from his PC. C. Adam deleted all said files from onedrive recycle bin
 10x in advance.

 I will say that I am not connected to said company (IT wise), I was just asked to consult as an external reference.
 I've already told management that they are f@#ked 😉 and that they should seriously rethink their BYOD policy.

 I'm not sure if I'm in the correct place as my knowledge on these matters is limited. 
 I'm looking for a way of changing the my IP addresses to areas in the states without using traditional VPN's. I work in the adult entertainment industry and we continually see persecution on social media platforms and regularly find ourselves IP banned. Also engagement is also much better in the US. 
 Is there a way of creating a unique VPN that relies on an IP address that isn't widespread? The issue with some VPN providers is that the social media websites know it belongs to a VPN and we notice considerable drops in engagement and explore.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

 I have been tasked with moving their current roaming profiles over to DFS namespace via folder redirection. Currently each person's roaming profile sits on an old file server that needs to be decommissioned and this includes everything they have ever had in their Home directories.
 With this in mind, I have used robocopy to copy over all of the data where their Home directories exist now to the new location on a new file server.
 In Group Policy Management I'm having trouble figuring out the best GPO to deploy to ensure that their home directories (which are roaming) are correctly pointed to the new DFS path along with each person still having access to all of the data that they had in their old roaming profile.
 In the GPO I made under User Configuration > Windows Settings > Folder Redirection I need to ensure that each person will still have access to their data in their home drive while correctly redirecting their data to the DFS path.
 It's a confusing task to me and any input would be appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Linux, we can use sandbox environments such as flatpak to secure high risk apps such as web browsers against 0 day attacks. Its very good since I can basically tell it for example which folders, files can a process access, or which devices it can access (webcam, etc). 
 So Is there any similar solution in Windows that doesn't brick the performance of the app? Meaning, securing apps such as browsers against potential 0 day RCEs.

 Sometimes I'm asked to do stuff on windows, usually powershell, and this is one of those cases, but I don't understand the implications of what I'm asked to do and would appreciate pointers.
 I have a bunch of fileservers, I'm sending the logs to a graylog, I'm now asked to enable granular file access auditing, which users is accessing/creating/deleting which files.
 obviously there's a bunch of permissions already set on the fileserver shares.
 I'm now playing with a test server and found out via ms documentation that I need to enable the file system auditing policy, I've done that (on my test server).
 then I see I have to enable autiding on the folder I intend to audit access to.
 two questions:
 1) should I also enable the Audit File Share policy?
 https://imgur.com/a/dftoXYk
 2) when I set the auditing on a folder I'm asked a principal, type, applies to and then basic permission, it's the basic permission that are putting me off.
 https://imgur.com/a/10ulh6D
 I mean I understand (I think), the principal/type/applies to settings, for which principal should log events be generated, for which action, and if it applies recursively.
 but why should I set permissions in this tab? am I gonna overwrite the fileserver permissions when I enable this? and what is the thinking behind setting permissions here?

The reason for the post is we are looking to remove our MSP and bring support inhouse. Which entails replacing the security stack with something new. I was at a conference last month and found out that Acronis now plays in this space.
 The question I pose to you is have you use their solution? NGAV/EDR/Backup/Email Filtering? All or some of it? Thoughts about it? From the brief overview I had of it, it seems pretty decent but once again it was just a brief overview and in a short time you can make anything look wonderful. Its only after a decent test do you see the flaws or benefits.

 We moved a few windows PCs to a managed switch, and NLA breaks (doesn't show connected to the domain network for NLA).

 When we move the pcs back to the unmanaged switches, NLA works as expected. I tested turning off igmp snooping, but of course that didn't (and shouldn't) resolve it.

 I currently have Gsuite for less than 20 employees, at most 20gb of files on g-drive for a single user but most are under 5gb of use, we have a bunch of alias emails, don't utilize any social aspect of the platform. Just straight email, storage of files, and collabs on spreadsheets.
 Instead of upgrading to Google workspace basic, I was looking into Microsoft O365 business standard which seems to be comparable in pricing and usage of storage, spreadsheets.
 My concern is how easy is it to configure the new O364 business account to use the domain name for emails, migrate users emails and files, and aliases? Anything else I would be missing to ask about for a migration or gotchas?
 Luckily, the environment is small and simple but I would imagine the same solution would apply for small businesses of 50-100 employees but open to any easy work around as well.
 Thanks for your help and time as I greatly appreciate it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, we have a cluster of firewalls at a client that loose Internet connectivity every few months. Just like that. LAN continues to work but WAN goes dark. They do respond to ICMP on the WAN side but do not process user traffic. No amount of troubleshooting can bring them back up working so.. we do reboot that "fixes" things.
 One time, second time, and today - for the third time. 50 developers can't work and ask why, what's the issue? We bought industry leading firewalls, why? 
 We ran there, downloaded the logs from the devices and opened a ticket with the vendor. The answer was, for the lack of better word - shocking: 
 1) Current Firewall version XXX, we recommend to upgrade device to latest version YYY (one minor version up)
 2) Uptime 59-60 days is really high, we recommend to reboot firewall once in 40-45 days (with a maintenance window)
 3) TMP storage was 96% full, this happens due to long uptime of appliance
 ​
 The last time I felt this way was when some of the rookies went over to replace a switch and turned off the AC in the server room because they had no hoodies, and forgot to turn them on. On Friday evening... 
 So, how often do you reboot your firewalls? :) And guess who the vendor is.

 We have a 2 node Windows 2012 R2 File server failover cluster. We did a rolling update to 2016 basically keeping the same IP addresses.
 However, after completion, Samsung printer scan to server suddenly stopped working.
 During the test it says it lost connectivity, however same IP and firewall rule is intact. AD Audit fails to collect security logs as well.
 However, Windows client still can access the file server VIP and DFS without issues.
 Is there some local policy difference between Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 2016 that we can check?
 Please take note that we haven’t upgraded the cluster functional level to 2016.
 Also, reverting the cluster back to 2012 fixes the issue. 
 Thank you all in advance!

 I am trying to map external mapped drives (shares from a different domain server) through group policy. 
 Since Microsoft no longer offer the ability to specify login details I can't connect to drives using the different domain. 
 The users/servers are joined via site to site vpn so can access the servers, I'm just trying to automate the process so we don't have to manually map these every so often. 
 Is the only way to do this via a script? I have tried using a script via group policy but they don't seem to run correctly or end up failing for no real reason. (But work when ran locally) 
 Another thing to mention is there's 2 security groups that need access to these, which have different permissions/access for files so will need 2 separate setups for each group. (Group is held on the external server)
 I understand the best method for this would be to have connected the DCs but the client was only willing to pay for essentials and the 2nd/external server came along later. 
 Any suggestions are appreciated!

 Somewhere around 2021 we started getting new reps every 6 months who don't know anything and they just constantly try to sell us stuff. Our questions are rarely answered accurately and when they finally start to understand our needs we get a new rep. Is this happening with anyone else? Or maybe just the new norm since covid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Our company blocked the Microsoft Store for users on their Windows 11 laptops. Within the landscape they use a vulnerability scanning tool and there is a vulnerability in the AV1 Video Extension, so an update is needed from version 1.1.52851.0 to 1.1.60961.0.
 I tried to update the app with the following options, without any luck:
  
Setting Catalog -> Auto update apps in Store
 
Pro active remediation script that checks the version and if outdated, run the following:
 $namespaceName = "root\cimv2\mdm\dmmap" $className = "MDM_EnterpriseModernAppManagement_AppManagement01" $wmiObj = Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespaceName -Class $className $result = $wmiObj.UpdateScanMethod()
 
Deploy the AV1 Video Extension within Intune apps
 
Winget. Installed Winget and executed the command below:
 Winget upgrade -h --id Microsoft.AV1VideoExtension_8wekyb3d8bbwe --force
 
 Winget Output = no applicable upgrade found, while its still on the old version.
 So i tried different things without luck. I also tried it on another laptop with the Microsoft Store available, and then i can upgrade using the command below and it will updated to the latest version 1.1.60961.0 . Whats happening here?
 $namespaceName = "root\cimv2\mdm\dmmap" 
 $className = "MDM_EnterpriseModernAppManagement_AppManagement01" $wmiObj = Get-WmiObject -Namespace $namespaceName -Class $className $result = $wmiObj.UpdateScanMethod()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a 'rubber ducky' post here. I believe I've covered all the usual stuff before lighting candles, drawing floor markings and taking up day drinking. 
 We've a few servers on one host (smallish firm) and our main App is hosted on this particular 2016 VM. However, it has really thrown the toys out of the pram with updates. 
 ​
  
I've tried manually installing updates from the M U Catalog. Constantly getting - 0x80070490 in Event Log. 
 I've manually - restarted services, renamed Catroot2 and SoftwareDistribution folders, reset winsock, rebooted. 
 Tried a trusty script which does the above and more, which has worked previously for other servers and workstations (Stop services, rename folders, rename previous log, reset updates services, re-registered DLLs, cleared regkeys, reset winsock, reset BITS Transfers, and start services).
 I've removed AV and Malware protection just in case but that changed nothing.
  
​
 Beginning to think it's a blow it away and start over job but that's a bit of a nightmare with it being our main LOB app. Plus the time and costs to get the supplier to install and shift to a new VM. Usually the bottom 3 in that list of 4 has worked in my previous experiences but this just will not play ball. The other 2016 VMs are humming along nicely, 2019 all good and W10 machines all patched fine. 
 Any other ideas before I start making phone calls?

 We have a useless website that is supposed to be a CRM, but it doesn't integrate with a single piece of microsoft 365 (which is being paid for to be used by every single member of every firm) and theres no adobe integration to the sharepoint. Everything is done manually, by us at the front office. My job is supposed to be sales, but i spend 90% of my time doing admin. 
 Notionally, I understand how this tech is supposed to work... we pass adobe documents around for new data, which is integrated to the website via sharepoint lists, then we pull 3rd party data from APIs to fill the gaps. In practice, I don't know who's job it should be to actually build this shit and who is responsible for the failures of the current system. 
 It seems like nobody is even speaking my language and I need to hear experts tell me that what I am envisioning is normal, its not difficult, and I'm not crazy.
 Ive taken on the mentality of "if you want something done right, do it yourself" to try and build little automations the best i can, but barely anything sticks. 
 Is this an lost cause? Should I simply give up and hope that my bosses hire more admin to keep this glaring issue out of sight and out of mind, or should i be concerned that without these basic process management systems in place, our business will never scale?

 I believe I have seen a tool like this before, something they can use to create these accounts, or bulk upload too. Its then a portal the receptionist can utilise.
 Has to be idiot proof (so to speak) and be very "wizardy" in its simplicity. 
 Anyone know of such tools? Or recommendations?

 Basically, on a NAS there were multiple iSCSI mount points in a target LUN from a NAS. 2 mount points with the same disk space. 1 was originally mounted into a Windows server as NTFS.
 I was trying to mount the second mount point into ESXI as Datastore and realized soon enough that it was the wrong disk that got formatted. 
 Is there ANY way I can revert this and try to save the data for the NTFS volume? As this was a backup point, there are no copies for the data on this drive. I have not deleted the Datastore from the esxi as there is a warning it will try to delete all data (trying to preserve any more writes on it) :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is the wrong place. I trust the mods will let me know.
 I'm trying to get some work out from underneath me a few weeks before it's due in order to free up my schedule and also because it would give me a considerably longer leash at work. What I'm trying to do is write out some SNMP monitoring rules for a Bosch IP camera, but I don't have access to the device yet in order to figure out what to monitor.
 We're using a really rudimentary SNMP monitoring system where you give it the OID and it monitors it for a response within the guidelines you give it. I wish we'd migrate to something more intelligent but you play the hand you're dealt.
 What I'd normally do is:
  
Run an SNMP walk on the device using its MIB (which I have)
 Confirm the MIB against the walk to make sure the numbers line up
 Strip out the stuff I can't monitor against/don't care about
 Make the monitor using the OIDs that remain
  
Here I don't have the device, all I have is the MIB. Looking at it, I can see that – for example – "temp-sens" is "1.3.6.1.4.1.3967.1.1.7.1.1 " , but that's only so useful to me because I can't tell from the MIB whether I should be expecting anything after this to denote the individual sensor (".1.1", for example).
 Loading the MIB into various freeware programs does not make this immediately apparently either.
 Is there any technowizardry I can do ahead of time to denote the various sensors on the device (or at least tell if the MIB expects them) or is the only true indication of a device's SNMP capabilities taken from inspecting the device itself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been working lately on collecting performance data for my Windows server environment.
 I am collecting various performance statistics and I have a question about a specific value for servers with Hyper-v role.
 I have a question for the value 'System Current Pressure', which is provided by 'Hyper-v Dynamic Memory Balancer'.
 This value is always 100 on every server I have reviewed. I realize that the 'Average Pressure' value is more important and I collect and monitor its value.
 I can't find on Microsoft's sites an exact description of what this parameter refers to and what it means. I checked it on a server that did not have a single virtual machine and this value is also equal to 100.
 There is also a similar value in another category 'Hyper-v Dynamic Memory VM' and here the values are different for virtual machines which makes sense. Value of 100 means that the machine has reached its RAM limit and you should investigate whether to allocate more or perform optimization.
 The question is what does this value mean for 'Hyper-v Dynamic Memory Balancer'?

I've reached out to the software company who are also based in the UK to request for administrative access to the system but they've refused unless we undergo a £400 3hr training course (and pass it based on their 'feeling'). The system isn't anything complicated, and our account manager is somewhat of a dinosaur and doesn't understand the basics of the day to day regulatory requirements of running an IT service it just seems to be a bit of a 'being difficult' situation. Does anyone know if there's anything that goes against some form of legality etc if a software company that sells software to withold administrative access to the customer so they can generate more business in doing so? (ontop of a very hefty annual bill they are charging per new task).

Many legitimate emails with DKIM & SPF aligned either get filtered to spam on our side or their side. Sometimes even being quarantined all together. The bothering part is that it happens even in mail conversations so it seems like you’ve never received an answer or invite. Do you guys experience this too and or have a solution to this?

 Thinkpad 14s is connected to Dell monitor with type-C cable. The problem is that half the times Windows 10 does not recognize monitor.
 I cannot simply add HDMI cable because next day it works again and the combo show black. I want to retain type-C for charging and data (kbd, cam, mouse) but not for display. For display I want to use HDMI cable which is 100% reliable. Disabling Thunderbolt 4 in BIOS didn't disable video. Is there any registry value to change or device to disable.

 I dont think this is happening in the US - the download link is https://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/products/backup-power-ups-surge-it-power-distribution/power-management-software-connectivity/eaton-intelligent-power-manager/software/ipm-version-2/eaton-ipm-vmware.zip - there wouldn't be someone kind enough to download it for me somewhere I can collect it?
 I am also having trouble getting a trial Activation ID from the website. I only need IPM for 30 days as we go to colocation then. I've filled in the form for both the USA and Europe request, I get the email asking me to confirm the email address, click, but never receive the Activation ID.
 Ive spoken to support who say it is a "marketing" issue and they don't know what to do. I would give my left leg and first ugly child if someone could assist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure how odd this will sound, but I'd like to reach out and gauge how much dev work some of you do. There is a bit of a fuzzy line with devops nowadays, as well as X as code, plus scripting is a way of writing code as well.
 So where does sysadmin end, then? I often find myself adjusting or extending the source code of FOSS Software we use as well, is this still part of a sysadmin job or have I veered over into dev territory?
 We're a small team and there's not a whole lot in terms of automation. And obviously no devops since we don't have any devs. This, in combination with me being a junior/early in my career and also having had an interest in programming as a hobby has led to me feeling like I lack a proper frame of reference on what is normal for a modern sysadmin. It has also led to a severe case of double imposter syndrome as I feel like I am faking being a dev AND an admin while doing neither of the two properly.
 Are any of you in a similar position or want to share your thoughts? Should I specialise more or stick with my somewhat special "stuck between worlds" approach? I really love the way it makes me fit into my current team as it makes me feel like really having an impact by pushing us forward by automating and streamlining workflows. But at the same time I worry that it'll make it extremely hard to find a new job if I have to as other employers will likely look for some kind of specialist whereas I've cranked the generalist knob way past 11.
 Small disclaimer: I know that usually there's teams for different parts of sysadmin (networking, security, systems, etc) but as stated, we're small and just a handful of people so we have to wear several hats anyway.

 I work as an operations manager part of a small IT team composed of various roles including server admin, cloud admin, network engineer, and a few helpdesk techs.
 ​
 As an infrastructure team, we are tasked with all kinds of different projects and tasks. We currently do not have any formal project management framework to work with and that causes a slew of issues including lack of focus/momentum, projects getting forgotten about, scattered priorities, and constantly jumping on the fire of the week, just to name a few.
 Recently, I started down the path of trying to implement Agile Scrum to solve our issues. I feel that the agile method of iterative progress/accomplishments will work well for us…]]></summary>

I'm aware of CWDM multiplexors, but that is way more complex than what Im looking for. What Im seeking for is a way to connect several transceivers pairs and to send traffic between them, but selecting one pair at time. This "adapter" will be connected to one SFP+ port of a switch, so the idea is to test each transceiver pair without disconnecting it from that switches port.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

No endpoint is dual homed. Some closet switches go to one switch, others the 2nd switch. Only one 7010 has an upstream static route to the router and no routing exists between the switches. They want to insert a Palo Alto firewall between the two 7010’s in order to keep some outside traffic off the 2nd 7010. 
 I can’t get a second connection to the router. I cant re-ip the network. I cant get a routing protocol on the router. I cant have more than 4 hours downtime. I have to implement a PA between the two. 
 Any thoughts on a good way to do this? Besides just burn the whole network down and start over???

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Full disclosure, I’m not an IT person, I work in live events and had some weirdness going on today at a convention center and was curious if there was some guidance here. 
 Essentially I had two laptops wired into a dumb switch DHCP and they were golden. 
 I tried my personal Lenovo thinkpad wired into the same switch a bit later and was unable to get internet using dhcp. I checked and it kept auto connecting me to a gateway that was unused by the it department. Mind you, using wifi, internet worked fine on dhcp, but not wired. 
 They were pretty quick to shrug and say not my problem since the other laptops were working, but they were nice enough to designate me a static ip and the laptop is now working while wired.
 I’m just really trying to understand why this would happen, as I’ve used my laptop at plenty of venues and never experienced this. I reset the network from the status settings , I released and renewed dhcp from the command prompt, all to no avail. 
 I was trying to stop and start my dhcp certificate but was running into an error 5 code and unable to do it even though Im the primary user. 
 Curious if anyone has experienced this, and if there’s any guidance on how to deal with this in the future. 
 Thanks

 My business is currently looking at Forti client on the endpoint to connect remotely to the office. We are currently using Citrix cloud to connect remotely to a shared environment and Zscaler ZPA to connect to specific app that doesn't fit Citrix Shared app. (mainly used for consultant and external.)
 As a Network admin, I'm not super keen about going with FortiClient and EMS, I've always had issue in the past concerning latency, crash, connection not establishing, etc... I also don't find it to be super secure for our network. Note that I'm the only network admin ATM.
 Lastly, can one man really support a VPN for 300 end users?
 I'd like to know your experience & your thought about using Forti SSL VPN / ZTNA.

When you enter a certain user's email address into the To field of your outlook client, a message appears saying the mailbox is not monitored and to use a different address blah blah blah. It looks just like an automatic reply / out of office message you'd turn on if you're out. The problem is, I have no idea where it's coming from. Help desk looked at her client and said there's no auto reply turned on and ran a repair on office before escalating to me. I looked over EAC and there are no forwards set up, no auto reply, no transport rules. Where could this be coming from?

 Plugging in a WAP and a phone worked okay so I could continue on but it'll be a pita going forward if I can't check/test PoE using the tools.
 Before I start in depth testing, has anyone come across this?
 I have a fancy new LinkRunner 10G coming so hopefully that'll work.

Connectivity to all devices but the Dell switch from outside the branch office works fine, but I can't even ping the thing unless I'm on that LAN.
 It doesn't appear to be firewall related, and I'm wondering if there might be some ACL or other service on the Dell switch preventing access to it outside the LAN. 
 I have a login to the CLI but that's about it. I tried thumbing through Dell's documentation but didn't find anything glaring when I tried printing the config.
 edit - I did note it was on an 8 year old firwmare version and updated it several releases. Still, no luck.

 How common is this setup? If we were to have 1 circuit per ISP would this make things more difficult for us? Why don't we have 2 handoffs per ISP? I guess this failover is handled by the ISP router? Quite a few questions here but I'm trying to demystify this!

 I'm not sure what other information would be helpful in determining a replacement, but lets assume all things be equal? (generally) 
 I am in charge of finding a replacement, I am mainly a system admin, not networking admin so bare with my lack of needed knowledge. I know enough about using firewalls, but not when it comes to replacing it.
 Question:
 Anyone have any recommendations are similar firewalls to the Sophos SG230 that would be a good upgrade/replacement?

 In my daily job i'm a network engineer/architect. Are there any tips on learning and eventually mastering Python while working in the Networking branche? What i mean is: would you still recommend a course like Automate the Boring Stuff or maybe something else? Cause maybe I'm just too enthousiastic, but my goal is to add Python as an "addon" to my daily networking jobs.

 I released version 1.5.1 of mxcheck. mxcheck is a little helper that checks e-mail servers for correct DNS entries, certificates, information leaks and if the e-mail server is an open relay. It is a command line tool and open source.
 Happy if it helps you.
 https://github.com/steffenfritz/mxcheck
 As always, if you find a bug or have a feature idea, let me know.
 p.s.: I posted for older version here before, so please don't ask for docker, web user interface or why you should use this and not another solution. I create this in my sparetime to get my work done and I am happily sharing it. If you use something different, it is absolutely ok. <3

 Recently one of our "VIP" users had the problem that his desktop icons get moved around when he changes workplace (WOH or Laptop). Maybe an important to note, is that he has 3 displays and connects to a VM through a software client on his worklaptop (connected via dockingstation).
 I saw if you disable all the "move automatically" and grid settings, then it shouldn't move everything around or "memorize" where what was, even when switching between mono or multi displays setups.
 I tested it on my setup and it didn't seem so consistent with "memorizing" where I set the icons. Has anyone had any similar experience or what do you guys use? If anything.
 P.S: Yes, it is very important on which screen what icon is placed...

 If my existing VPNs have specific encryption domains and I add a tunnel for 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 is that going to cause problems?

I feel like most people in the comments are not understanding the mechanism that makes this potentially problematic. I will admit that the author of the website, focusing primarily on his disdain for a particular corporation, doesn't help clarify the point.
 A significant amount of software automatically converts parts of text that appear to be URLs (even without an explicit protocol) into clickable links. These include mail clients, messengers, internet forums, social media sites, CMS systems, text editors, etc.
 Until now, such software would convert hello.com into a clickable link (since .com is a valid TLD) but would leave hello.zip as is (since .zip wasn't one).…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run IT at a small K12 school. One of my summer projects is to run fiber optic cable to an outbuilding. I did this last year to a different outbuilding and it worked great.
 Sad Story (optional)
 The one PITA part was fishing the FOC into the innerduct at the beginning. I got 1/2" non-split LDPE, thinking that it would better protect the FOC than split tubing would. Well, that backfired because after I ran the cable ALL the way through the underground conduit and plugged it in, it didn't work! I ordered a new cable, repeated the tedious process
 The Actual Question
 Should I use split or non-split innerduct? The split kind would be easier right? I could just sideload the cable all the way down, right?
 The cable will run through our attic (wood trusses and cinder block walls), down the exterior wall and in gray PVC in a trench across the yard to the outbuilding, and then up the wood stud wall into the nearest room.
 Currently planning to use this LDPE from eBay (with the ends taped together) if split is OK.
 Bonus: the cable is OS2 LC/LC UPC Plenum-rated (OFNP), as per local networking guy.
 Originally posted in r/FiberOptics last week, but I'm looking for more input. I'm particularly interested in the rationale behind your opinion.

Mostly working fine and dandy, but seeing issues occasionally post and during VHD mount that appear to relate to VSS writers timing out.
 Basically around the time we've had reported issues, i can see errors in the DFS server logs relating to VSS. In application logs:
 EventID 12298 (VSS)
 Volume Shadow Copy Service error: The I/O writes cannot be held during the shadow copy creation period on volume \\?\Volume{fed84df2-6fdf-466b-9ce9-9e3671b67ba8}\. The volume index in the shadow copy set is 0. Error details: Open[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ], Flush[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ], Release[0x80042314, The shadow copy provider timed out while holding writes to the volume being shadow copied. This is probably due to excessive activity on the volume by an application or a system service. Try again later when activity on the volume is reduced.
 ], OnRun[0x00000000, The operation completed successfully.
 ].
 Operation:
 Executing Asynchronous Operation
 Context:
 Current State: DoSnapshotSet
 ​
 System Logs:
 event id 8 (Volsnap)
 The flush and hold writes operation on volume X: timed out while waiting for a release writes command.
 I don't have VSS enabled on the volume, no backup application running at the time etc. I'm assuming DFS doesn't rely on the VSS service to perform it's replication to other member servers?, if so can i disable the service on the basis no shadows configured on the volume and no backup apps rely on the service?

I noticed that routers such as the MX204 only have 4x100Gbe ports. I'm new to networking and don't fully understand how this works but I'm fairly sure people use a switch to 'extend' these ports.
 For example, a 100GB port could become 10x10Gb virtual interfaces. I realize that I may have gotten some terminology incorrect here but would appreciate any help with pinning down what this is called and how it works.
 Thanks for any help!
 Edit: And does this work only for downstream or can you also 'extend' upstream ports?

 Current sessions are very long meaning that for exemple scan-to-mail takes a long time. Ill see about 150 seconds before session is ended and the mail has been sent.
 Feels like an quit command cant be recived from printer or from smtp server.
 Our firewall was also updated regard firmware.
 If i terminate an session in smtp, the mail is sent right away.
 An manual quit command kind of.
 ​
 Any idé what it could be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, We’re doing some tests with OCFS2 for creating an active passive setup across two regions.
 In the current setup, we have two DCs, dc01 and dc02. VMs vm01 and vm02 share an ocfs2 fs. The shared virtual disk resides on a dedicated lun that is replicated to the remote site. vm03 and vm04 are in dc02 with ocfs2 setup with the same cluster name. For failover the vms in dc01 are shutdown, the lun is switched to rw mode in dc02, virtual disks are mounted in vm03/04 and then ocfs2 is mounted. This is working as expected but involves tasks at the san level.
 I was reading about drdb and was wondering if we can use it to replicate the ocfs2 in dc01 over wan to dc02. In this approach we’ll just use independent virtual disks and not use the san based replication.
 But is this even possible? Should we setup drdb between vm01 and vm03 or is my understanding not correct?

 I am looking at the server.xml file, but I am not 100% sure how to proceed.
 I see different SSL "connectors" like NIO and APR/native. I don't know the difference. Which one should I use and why?
 The config points to three files: certificateKeyFile, certificateFile and certificateChainFile.

 Is the below approach correctly understood?

 certificateKeyFile is the privkey.pem file
 certificateChainFile is the fullchain.pem file
 But what should I put in certificateFile?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy, all,
 Just curious to know if anyone has any practical experience/comments on a Netscout 7120 PFS or similar “qualified” hardware. I’m hoping someone in the financials may be using this and is doing so with a relatively high rate of traffic.
 My concern is buffer space as a relates to microbursts. We currently use Arista 7150s which are slated for decommissioning in favor of the 7280 platform, and that old platform drops traffic like crazy, but for a new deployment the leadtime on the 7280 is way too long, so we’re looking at the Netscout side of things.
 Unfortunately, I don’t have a good indication of throughput requirements as yet, however, on paper, it’s possible it may fit the bill.
 Unfortunately, I’ve asked Netscout to put me in touch with existing clients to which they have not done so and have simply indicated that they have “received no complaints.”
 So, is anyone using this particular platform, and if so, have you seen any issues related to frame drops?

 Before the remote SMTP server tries another delivery, the A record mail.example.com is updated to point to a failover server. Will remote SMTP servers re-resolve the hostname mail.example.com on the second delivery attempt or will they use the IP address they received the first failure from?
 I could test this, but I would be interested in real-life experience as I'm sure different mail server software will behave differently if this is not RFC-mandated.

 Long time lurker, first time poster.
 ​
 I've recently been tasked with creating/implementing a ticketing system (I'm a new Apprentice IT Technician) for our Team of 2 (within the Education Industry) and would love to know what ticketing system everyone uses. I know that it's possible to use google forms and export this to a google sheet/excel document. But ideally I'd love something that I can make reports on and export into csv files. 
 We have roughly 1000 users so being able to select a priority and categorising the calls would be an amazing feature. Ideally I'd love for a free solution but honestly please drop any/all suggestions and I will see what is cost effective for us.

 I can't seem to find a straight answer for deploying Windows 11 however. I can install my applications fine, but struggle to capture the image using MDT. I have read that a lot of people experience issues with MDT. I am thinking - there's got to be a straightforward way of doing this that I am missing when reading Microsoft docs, etc.
 What is the standard method for deploying Windows 11 Azure joined machines? Or what is your preferred method? Any help is massively appreciated.

 I've check all my CA policies and the account is excluded from them, I haven't changed any settings in the admin panel for months so I can't see why the account would suddenly be required to have MFA set up.

 The problem for us is... how far should we go if we don't have external requirements?
 We aren't trying to get trusted by the CA/Browser forum, as far as I know there are no industry cert 'bridges' we are intersted in, we don't fall under PCI or HIPPA or any specific compliance standard. Theres ISO 27099 as a general aplicabaility standard but its not very prescriptive of the implementaiton, only the 'paperwork' assocaited with it. 
 When proposing options (i.e windows cert store vs yubi HSM, vs Thales HSMs) with tens of thousands of dollars difference, for an area of our infra not well understood by the non technical folks, what justification can I give other than "more money more betterer" to guide the discussions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure how many Nutanix admins we have here, but in my environment we applied the DBX files as mentioned in ADV200011 and Microsoft guidance for applying Secure Boot DBX update (KB4575994).
 Every month after applying Windows Updates all the servers which have had the DBX files applied suddenly become vulnerable to BootHole again and Nessus starts flagging them with:
 The Windows Secure Boot forbidden signature database (DBX) did not contain the expected certificates. When performing DBX updates exactly as illustrated in the vendor documentation, it is important to note that you are applying only the latest update. Updates applied in this manner may only appended to the DB, so you may still need to apply the older updates from the "Archive of Prior Versions of DBX Files" linked in the UEFI Revocation List File document (linked in the See Also advisory). Please refer to the vendor advisory for more information. 
 Nutanix supposedly fixed the issue in a update to Foundation (4.5.4.2 - Nutanix Account may be required)
 For the past few months, I've been pushing this out to all the Virtuals on the Nutanix cluster from PDQ (which only temporarily fixes):
 Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\apr2021\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\apr2021\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\aug2022\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\aug2022\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite Set-SecureBootUefi -Name dbx -ContentFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\sep2022\content.bin -SignedFilePath C:\programdata\boothole\DBX\sep2022\signature.p7 -Time 2010-03-06T19:17:21Z -AppendWrite 
 I've logged two calls with Nutanix, and the outcome is because its a Windows VM it can't be a Nutanix issue so contact Microsoft.
 Other than contacting Microsoft, does anyone know how we could resolve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 My organization is looking for a cost-effective MDM solution that is suitable for our environment and our requirements. The primary objectives are to manage BYOD (mainly mobile devices with Andoird, iOS operating systems) and a few corporate mobile devices if applicable, such as controlling the number of mobile devices per user, secure access (requiring devices to be password-protected, data to be wiped in case of theft or compromise). 
 Currently, we do not use Microsoft Office but Google Workspace (G-Suite) with Enterprise Starter license. As with this license, we can enable basic features of mobile device management, like enabling passcode, wiping data. On the other hand, we wish to limit the number of authorized/registered mobile devices (BYOD), and also want to improve some optional features, such as blocking insecure devices (jailbreak or rooted devices, unsupported/legacy devices), requiring anti-malware protection, requiring device encryption, automatically removing devices that haven't check in for 30 days.
 We have narrowed down the list of vendors to Google Workspace (Advanced Device Management), ScaleFusion, Miradore. Some of the solution providers that are ruled out include Microsoft Intune (I love it but we are using Google Workspace), JumpCloud (Anroid devices not supported), SimpleMDM & Mosyle (only iOS devices supported). I personally prefer Google Workspace (Advanced Device Management) given the fact that our ecosystem is based on it (we will not have to invest more time or resources to another solution) and our security requirements are just fundamental.
 Given that, can you share your feedback or experience in this matter? Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated!

This would help us blocking former staff and students from accessing our networks as soon as respective Google accounts are suspended.
 Random questions: 
  
Can users be assign to specific VLANs depending on a sort of ACLs or groups of users? 
 Could this work using only one SSID or would a secondary SSID be required for guests?
 How would you manage guests for a temporary access?
 
 Any experience on this matter?

 I have tried creating a scheduled task icon which only works for myself.

 I have tried running Application Compatibility Toolkit and making a shim but that doesn't work.
 I have reached out to the developer to see if they have a signed copy of ViPlex Express but I will not be holding my breath on getting a positive outcome from that enquiry.

At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, the only active equipment at these sites will be a single Wi-Fi access point. Currently at each location, the BiDi fiber is terminated in an SPF in an 8-port Cisco switch. The AP is then uplinked to and is powered by the switch. 
 These switches are well past their expected life and I will be replacing them before they start failing. 
 Since we don’t need all of the extra switch ports, I have been looking for a media converter that has an SFP cage as well as that can provide PoE out on its copper port (for the AP). These have been impossible to locate thus far.
 Does this device exist?
 I know I can get a low port count switch with PoE out and an SFP cage from Mikrotik and likely others, and I’ll likely go down that road if needed. I was hoping to avoid the extra configuration with those, though.
 Thanks for any pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that IGMPv3 allow two servers to use the dance multicast address to send data to subscribers/receivers. I understand this is accomplished by allowing the receiver to specify a physical source address when requesting to join a multicast group. My question is why would someone design a topology that way. Wouldn't it be better to just use a different multicast address for different data. 
 I read that it could lead to reduced bandwidth by using a single multicast to send different data. I can't visualize how the bandwidth demand would be any different.

 While these are undoubtedly advanced and powerful tools, it seems to me that they're not widely used in a lot of real-world enterprise networks. Many companies, especially smaller ones, don't use these specific tools in their daily operations.
 So, I'm wondering, shouldn't the ENCOR exam focus more on technologies and skills that are more universally applicable in today's networking world?

 so I have a network at my office where the nas has our file, and everyone through the nas can access the file and log on and make amends and whatnot. recently im looking to get another office opened in another country and I want to make it possible for people in other countries to access my local (main) network so they can also open that file from the nas and make amends.
 if the file was on the other location this would cause a problem as there will now be 2 files and then if someone for remote cant sees the local changes and vice versa.
 with some research, I've seen that maybe a Site-to-Site Vpn would work for this and would allow my remote devices to act as if they are on the local network. I've seen a firewall box called the merwaki go GX50 which apparently has the Site to site VPN function, so im here to ask would this work and is there any other solutions that i can deploy or better suited for this use case.

 I have tried other devices and other browsers with the same issue. And it's just my website. So this isn't a internet or chrome or web browser issue I don't think.
 I'm guessing something went wrong with my website. Maybe I got hacked? I got a really weird email saying "42 - ( ) " that said it was sent from myself via my website, around the time my website went down.
 How can I fix this when I can't even access the control panel of my website? (since I need to go to my website to access the Wordpress dashboard)

 Our current conundrum is twofold. I need to build a server that can house a MySQL server VM database that any one or two or three of 10 people can access at any given time, as well as run a file sharing VM to access a few network mapped drives. I’ve been looking servers with 2x xenon e5-2699 v3s, would that be enough processing power? 128gb ram and probably 8x 1tb SSDs. 
 More importantly at the moment, we just tried switching ISPs for gigabit speeds and learned the hard way that comcast blocks port 445 and will not unblock it no matter what. And we use 445 for our current Azure file shares SMB network mapped drives. Is there a good work around for the mean time while I get this new server built? Our MSP wants $4k to build an Azure VPN to tunnel the file shares but that’s a little absurd. Thanks!

 Basically, I just want another instance of windows to multi-box something, but other software as VMware and Virtualbox dont work. I know other people that use RDP for the reason I want to use it for too, so thats why Im deciding to use it, however none of them ran into the problem im having.
 Ive created 2 seperate Admin accounts on my PC, one with just a Name / pw, and the other with my microsoft email.
 I am using "127.0.0.2" to try and log into the either of the second users, and using the microsoft account one does not work for some reason, it says credentials are wrong. However I can use the other user that i named "Test" with a password i set.
 However upon loggin into that account, I am greeted by the error stated in the title. I have googled the issue and there are a ton of people also having similar problem, will some suggestions saying to add registry keys, or change some setttings in windows to change the limit of connections. I have done all of these but they have not worked.

 I've been struggling with this issue for a few hours and after hours of searching for solution I decided to ask for help here (I very rarely go ask to a forum). It appears that uwsgi cannot bind to /run/uwsgi due to it being a read-only filesystem. When I try to set the location elsewhere it results in the same thing. Does anyone know what to do with this?

 I am posting this question to the community as I am looking for some suggestions, helpful guides which can help me implementing the design to achieve the below scenario:
 Scenario: We have to automate the application onboarding for OIDC/SAML app. hosted in secure auth to ForgeRock.
 Design: Similar to any IAC tool where we declare the desired state using a yaml file, the same conecpt is said to be utilized. We would have a yaml file defining application details. Going through terraform registry, I found that there is no such provider defined for oidc/saml app onboarding by ForgeRock. Also, if we define a plugin for same we are restricted by the programming language (need to use Go for development). So, we need a kind of python script which can function similar to a provider in Terraform, reading through the desired application configuration from the yaml file and then making use of the rest api endpoint exposed by ForgeRock for creating the app.
 Can anyone in the community please help me out here with any useful resources like any Github repo's ,opensource project, docs which I can make use of to give me a starting point about how this can be implemented?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody, 
 Last week my company decided they want to set up three TVs in the production facility which only purpose will be to show on all screens the same web page. This TVs have Android and Chromecast built-in and will be connected over Wifi. I have already set up an hidden SSID with a separate VLAN with only guest access (they can't reach any service or server aside from the ones I decide to). I have also set up a Windows 10 VM to try casting via Google Chrome and it works fine. The issue is that this setup takes a lot of resources from the VM and sometimes the image on the TVs gets "blurry" when it's still for a few mins. The question is: is there a better way to do what I'm doing? I can't find any viable desktop software that lets me cast to multiple devices. 
 Unfortunately, we can't use any additional wiring because the distances will be too high. The only thing we could improve would be to connect the TVs via Ethernet. 
 Thanks in advance for any tips/suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My knowledge of this is very partial, I hope this is the right place to ask.
 Some months ago I started paying an extra to my ISP in order to have a static IP, which I think it entails not being behind a Carrier-grade NAT.
 I see that my router is choosing 100.64.0.83 and 100.64.0.84 as DNS servers. Under my understanding, DNS servers are "external/public machines", for instance 8.8.8.8 belongs to Google. But looking up 100.64.0.83, it seems like it's a "shared address space", which seems to be like the 192.168.0.xx, part of a private network. But I don't t hink it's not part of my private network (the ping is higher). Am I actually behind a CGN or am I misunderstanding something?

1 Windows Server 2019 PC where GPMC is controlled [DC] (192.168.4.10)
 1 Windows 11 PC to access the PC above to modify GPMC (192.168.4.99)
 10 PC Clients (192.168.4.150 [-159])
 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
 Default Gateway: 192.168.4.2
 Primary DNS: 192.168.4.10
  
The idea is for the clients to access the Internet through the Windows Server 2019 station, as I plan on doing some sort of filtering. That is, if a client attempts to access a blocked site, they will see a site unavailable page that I will re-direct them to.
 I was thinking to have them access the Internet through the Windows Server 2019 PC, but I've also been told that I should set up another server strictly for RRAS, which I'm very new to, as well.
 I also want to install software from GPMC. For that, I will need a shared folder somewhere on my network that my clients can access, without allowing access to my network settings or GPMC.
 My question: Please show me a network drawing of how I should go about this setup. There will be two users in my active directory: MyAdmin and MyUser. All 10 clients will connect using MyUser. The PC used to access GPMC will use MyAdmin.
 What (if any) PCs should I add to this network and what function would they serve? If I add more PCs, who handles acting like a router? File Server (for installations)? As I'm trying to do that all on the DC but I hear that's not good practice.

 I was wondering if you could recommend any applications that have free editions or trials? It would be great to test them out and see how they work in practice. Thanks in advance for your help!

 Would some authenticator apps have logs on their phone to look at? 
 For example:
 Microsoft authenticator just left a notification to on the phone to “approve sign in” and 1 hour later when user clicked the notice it just glitches out with a time out error message
 So no way to know which account triggered it?
 What steps would you do if it happened? And what are some logical possibility, (ie, the mail app on iPhone trying to login with cached credentials.) to tell the user so they don’t like freak out.

user is on a home internet connection
 
vpn is established
 
packets to the webserver are routed through the vpn
 
dns resolution through vpn works
 
login page of the webserver may load or timeout depending on luck
 
using another internet connection solves the issue
 
 I'm guessing there is something special about l2tp I don't understand, that's why i'm posting here. It looks like the some home routers are messing with some encrypted packets. How? I haven't seen behaviour like this ever before.

 I have a technical interview for a Sr. Linux Systems Administrators on Wednesday. I’ve heard that other failed candidates have been too ‘junior’.
 What in particular would you expect to come up on a Sr. Linux Admin technical interview?
 I think I’m at a senior level, but this has me nervous 😋
 Things I’m comfortable with:
  
Storage - Local and SAN. Various file systems. LVM. Monitoring disk space and disk performance/health 
 Upgrading systems and rolling back packages/kernels 
 Backups with various tools such as Veeam
 Compiling software with GCC/Make
 GIT
 NFS/Samba
 Monitoring tools such as Nagios/SolarWinds
 Networking/load balancing/firewalls/bonding 
 Active Directory/LDAP
 Bash/Python scripting 
 Ansible/Terraform
 Printing/cups
  
What am I missing that a senior should know how to do? 🙂
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. So I work in k12 and I've got this project that I'm working to implement over the summer and I was wanting some advice from those who are more network savvy than I am since I'm still pretty junior in this role.
 I've got 5 campuses all with their own NVRs on-prem to support their respective IP cameras. Each campus is connected to our main MDF/Server room via 10Gb Fiber connections in a Hub/Spoke topology. The idea here is to get rid of the old NVRs (they suck and require Edge in IE mode to even use) and move everything to a single server in our server room.
 The campuses all have the cameras on their own subnets but while some campuses have a completely isolated set of switches that only connect to cameras and the NVR, some of the older campuses don't have isolated switches and simply rely on VLANs.
 So basically this is what I have: 5 Campuses with their own subnets, some with dedicated switches, others with dedicated VLANs (Security).
  
172.16.50.0/24
 172.17.50.0/24
 172.18.50.0/24
 172.19.50.0/24
 172.20.50.0/24
  
I need to remove the NVRs and get them talking to a server located at 10.0.9.75.
 Now what I would *think* I need to do, is simply make sure all physical ports that cameras are located on are simply Untagged with the security VLAN, and make sure all successive uplinks between switches all the way back to the core switch (which the server will be connected to) are Tagged with the security VLAN.
 One of my big concerns is whether or not I need to implement any kind of Layer 3 routing (beyond what we already have) with this setup. I don't believe I do, but I would like advice on this if at all possible. 
 Please let me know if it seems like I've left something out or if I can answer any questions that might help better explain. Thank you

The issue I'm faced with is that for some strange reason, I cannot hear any sound from within the VDI environment through my regular sound output; they only way I can listen to sound within the VDI is if I switch my sound to my monitor's native speakers or plug in my headphones.
 I've searched all over the web for a solution and pretty much get the same note about installing a driver update, but after checking I have the latest.
 I'm running Windows 10 x64.
 I've tried:
  
Running Windows system check.
 Running Windows sound check/fix
 Disabling the native speaker option/driver
 Rebooting the computer.
 Checking to make sure I have the lastest updates.
 Cursing at my tower.
 Going outside to get a burger then coming home and trying steps 1-6
  
Nothing seems to change; advice would be apreciated.

Different drives, different hard drive bays, different SSDs, windows 11, windows server 2022. No matter what I do if any drive other than the ssd is connected when the machine is booted - booting from the ssd won’t even be an available option for me. Automatically off the list. I will always end up in the EFI shell. 
 So at this point I’m only connecting the SSD and booting to windows server 2022 and running random-ish firmware and driver updates from the intel site. Their site/tool is recognizing the individual hardware but throwing some error about some thing like my hardware configuration - idk I’m away from the house right now but I imagine it’s because of my Frankenstein setup so it’s not able to recommend drivers and updates for me I’m kinda guessing and checking. 
 I’m not sure my professor is even supposed to be used with this board the, Xeon 1650 V4 @ 3.6 GHz; but they were being used together in a product I got this from. 
 I have 128 GB RAM and a second processor on the way just cause. The setup should theoretically work as it is though they were running Linux. 
 I wanted to get started with something I was familiar with (windows) but I suppose I can try a Linux distro in parallel if there are suggestions. Would really love to solve this tho for windows. Want a GUI on either.
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title says it all. We actually will retain a low-end firewall for some basic security and to manage redundant ISP uplinks. 
 We went serverless. It wasn't even planned. Between going O365 and several other business critical apps migrating SaaS, when we looked to renew our on-prem server stack, it was real easy to just eliminate or migrate the remaining to PaaS/SaaS. 
 Part of that was moving to Azure AD and Intune/Defender, and then the more we looked at it, and with half our work force remote anyway, we felt we no longer needed on prem network security or a firewall. Just need internet. I feel we are more secure than before and it's easier to manage and keep up with.
 Costs and workloads are relative yet shifted. I don't even know if I am quite a sysadmin anymore. I have always had multiple roles, but not really a network admin for sure. But I keep busy. It has been stressful here in the middle of my career doing a complete upgrade in knowledge, and it was a crapton of work.

In our non-production systems, the best timing I could get for the activity was about 15 hours. Then 2 hours for checkout. So I have been advertising a 18 hour outage to give me some slush time. Coming in a couple hours early would make everyone happy, and running over would be painful, so having a little extra fluff was great (AKA The Montgomery "Scotty" Scott Engineering Rule).
 Cut to today. Had everything in place, management was frothing to get this going. They were all on the phone call for the official 'Go' decision. Then the inexplicable happens. Total time needed to complete: 7 hours, including checkout. WTF? Am I happy the upgrade went smooth and finished with zero issues, yes? But, WTF?
 15 minutes after the note to the users that the system was ready, I got my first email from management wanting to know who was responsible for missing the target by 10 hours. Some of the overseas sites are upset because they rescheduled manufacturing and warehousing schedules based on my estimate. Now I have to spend the next week explaining why my vendors seemed to be 'sandbagging' the non-prod systems and padding their numbers. Plus my credibility next time I go to ask for a production window is shot now.

The IT manager has experience with managed service providers and is skilled in project management, with previous knowledge of IT infrastructure. Therefore, the department is being managed by someone who is proficient in growing and documenting processes, as the company has a lack of documentation in general.
 My goal is to better manage the IT department and help it grow. I am interested in knowing the difference between an IT support specialist and a systems administrator and how I can develop my skills to become a future systems administrator for the company. I am eager to learn more about network administration, server management, and security management and pursue relevant certifications, such as Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), or CompTIA Security+. Additionally, I plan to work with my IT manager to develop and document IT processes and protocols, including standard operating procedures and user guides, to establish a strong foundation for the IT department.

 I’m working on getting a laptop on one of the specific WiFis on Unifi. Here’s the setup:
 NPS running on Windows Server 2022 std (running on Hyper-V) CA running on same server Self-signed cert in trusted store AD group for machines that will use RADIUS (only the one laptop, for testing) RADIUS client is set as UDM which manages 5 APs that the laptop can talk to Connection request policy also set to UDM IP Network policy grants access, is enabled, to Windows RADIUS group, NAS port type 802.11/ wireless Constraints set to auth method PEAP/EAP Cert for EAP set to NPS servers cert RADIUS standard attributes framed-protocol/PPP Unifi RADIUS profile created, shared secret the same for RADIUS client and Unifi profile, ports both set as 1812/1813 (auth/accounting)
 Trying to get the laptop to connect to network X tells me “checking network requirements”, “can’t connect” - does this when I’m running WPA3-Ent or WPA2-Ent, even WPA2- personal with passcode, enter passcode, checks network requirements, can’t connect.
 Any help would be appreciate!
 EDIT: also should note, there’s a duo auth proxy for the VPN that also uses this NPS, has an NPS client set as localhost

 I'm using Linux and I'm sort of familiar with creating new interfaces and adding a vlan tag to it but I only mention this because I thought I could just try to access the switch by setting a static IP and vlan.
 I'm wondering if there really is a way to get back in to it. I've been unsuccessful in my attempts but thankfully I can switch it to unmanaged so connected computers can use it.
 I guess I'm just looking for a fix for my mistake here.

 My last IT person took care of this and I don't recall more than one or two security updates over the years unless he was doing extras on the weekend he didn't alert anyone to.
 Opinions on cost and value?

 If you set up per-user licensing for server CALS and a worker has multiple dedicated accounts for specific tasks (daily user account, local admin account, server admin account, application admin account, domain admin account etc.), would each account in AD for each person need to be added to the license count for per-user licensing?

 We use Azure AD as our main IDP. Our entire workforce relies solely on SaaS apps, we don't have anything critical in our university on-prem
 For enterprise devices, we're looking for full control, management, 802.1x authentication, and visibility.
 For Student BYOD devices (2000+) we're looking for zero-trust access solutions for control and visibility when accessing SaaS apps. Students must have access within or outside the university network.

 Microsoft say number matching is the default from 8th but when I enabled push in the legacy MFA settings section it didn't always do number matching when I logged in to test.
 Sometimes it did number matching and sometimes it did a regular approve/reject push that was just with Outlook and the aka.ms/mfasetup logins.
 Is this normal?
 We'd like to use number matching and all the guides look like that's now the default so I don't get why it did a normal push.

 I am not sure if it is the culprit, but I do have a Raspberry Pi on my network running Pi-hole. I have tried to whitelist my domain, disable it, change upstream DNS server between Google and Cloudflare, but to no avail. I've even tried removing it from the network all together.

 First I'm new in admin/network (student/1st y internship in admin) and I try my best to learn the fundamentals sorry if I ask dumb question !
 I have a thesis to do for my school year and my subject is about the implementation of RADIUS server and 802.1X for wired et wireless (via VPN too) connection to network.
 I have 3 questions :
 Is it possible to do a "full" virtualization of this infrastructure ? I want something like packet tracer do(or GNS3 but never used it before) to configure 802.1X on switch port, a windows server with NAPS->NPS fonctionnality, test wired and wireless login.
 I belive it's possible to do 802.1X on packet tracer but for the windows server configuration ? It's possible to create VM on packet tracer, or the 'graphical' interface on the computers is enough ?
 2) Ok for local connection, what about VPN ? It's something I'm learning on my own but never install/configure one from now, is it difficult to link with RADIUS ?
 3) For now I want to build my own classic RADIUS lab but I think I'm screwed to do it in entreprise... Because we have a hybrid/full cloud infrastructure in Azure AD. I think it's a total another lvl of difficulty . Does anyone know more about this ?
 I'm not alone in my entreprise, we have a provider to take care of network tasks et management but he is not often there and I don't dare to ask basic question :(
 I'm trying to be very proactive on the subject (it's for october so it's pretty soon I think), I will keep you up about this !
 Thanks

 Our goal is to scale https://pinggy.io horizontally, and to achieve this, we need a DNS server that can respond to queries with data from a database. Ideally, the DNS server would forward the query to a web API that we will create, and the web API will respond with the DNS response.
 Do you know of any open source DNS servers that can do this? Any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance!

 So if you are looking for career advice, read the forum. I cherry-picked advice and found out what worked for me. So best of luck to everyone looking and another Thank You to everyone posting career advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I own a few older iOS devices that I want to try messing around with MDM profiles with and was wondering if it was possible to install MDM profiles with QR codes. I’m not very familiar with this and am still learning a lot of things, so if I seem lost, I’m sorry :(
 All devices have the latest iOS (16.4.1) if that helps and all have the ability to scan QR codes from the camera app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note: the system this post refers to is on premise.
 I'm not a sysadmin, so I could be wrong about this, but it seems wrong to me that to RDP into the computers in the DMZ, I need to remember/maintain a local windows account for each computer in the DMZ (we have several dozen). These accounts' passwords also expire after a month, which makes managing the accounts even more difficult. I have searched the web for what is considered best practice, and I haven't been able to find anything I can understand. I've seen a few posts about Read Only Domain Controllers and Jump Servers, but as a non sysadmin, I'm having a hard time understanding these.
 Now that you understand my question, let me give you a brief explanation of our system.
 The system is entirely on prem. At the front, we have a load balancer with a public IP. This is what our customers connect to. Behind the load balancer, we have the DMZ. The DMZ contains a number of windows server VMs running IIS. Behind the DMZ, we have our AD network. This is where our application and database server are. It's also where the computers used by our staff are.
 As a user of the system, my computer is in the AD network. As I mentioned earlier, I sometimes need to RDP into a server in the DMZ. Ideally, I would just use my AD credentials to authenticate, but that doesn't work because the DMZ is not part of the AD network.
 So, could you please tell me if the best way to connect to the servers in the DMZ is via local windows accounts? Another thing I'd like to know is, is a DMZ even necessary? Why can't the load balancer just route to the appropriate computer in the AD network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have a major SaaS EMR vendor we use by clinical staff (healthcare org) contacting us demanding that if we want to continue receiving emailed daily patient reports from them, due to a "bug" they recently fixed, they will now require SMTP information. From us. To receive emails addressed to us.
 Specifically, we need to provide them with:
  
Mail Server name and port username password default sender email security type(SSL/TLS/None)
  
Has a vendor ever asked you for this information? It seems bizarre we would have to provide our own server to email ourselves. How would you even do this securely?
 Oh, and we can't input this information ourselves -- we need to give it to them so THEY can set it up on their end! Sure, I'll get right on emailing you a username and password to connect to our Exchange server.
 Our users just want to continue receiving these emails.

 Will I be able to create a gateway /32 and have a VLAN for each uplink on my switch that will allocate a /32 public address and share the /32 gateway without any security vulnerabilities for packet sniffing between machines?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I've been tasked with converting a largish network from mixed EIGRP and OSPF to fully OSPF. I know I can usually run the two alongside each other since default admin distances are different, however, my dilemma is that EIGRP is running everywhere except between a core switch and a firewall out to the internet. The core switch and firewall are OSPF neighbors. The core switch is redistributing the OSPF and EIGRP tables into each other. Can I go ahead and safely stand up OSPF between this core switch and all downstream switches without causing routing loops? Or will I be stuck with taking down EIGRP before configuring OSPF?
