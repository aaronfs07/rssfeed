We want static IP addresses (specific addresses, not random), either generated locally or through an external service, on a single server. Or, a way to segment one server into many servers so as to assign each one a static IP.
 Any advice, even just a finger in the right direction, is more than appreciated. You will be saving this stressed out volunteer a lot of time, maybe!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All. 
 Windows Server 2019 running as a VM on VMWare sporadically loses network connection. The icon goes to the yellow exclamation point, saying it has no internet and I am not even able to ping the networks' gateway address. The way to "solve" it is by disabling, and enabling the network device. This immediately brings up the network device again and I can ping everything. I have checked that the power settings will not put the device to sleep (which should any way wake up when I log in via the console) . I cannot find ANYTHING in event viewer (probably looking in the wrong place) that would indicate why this happens. There are no events/alarms in VMware either.
 I am at a loss and would appreciate any help I can get.

 I've been using Microsoft TO Do to manage my tasks, but lately i havent been enjoying it. I mostly forget the daily tasks or reminders i set because i don't get any notification. I have to open the app first and go through the submaps before i can see a task i set. 
 What makes me love it is that i can easily add a mail as task. 
 My question is what else do you use to manage your day-to-day tasks and is there any form of notification you can get when you set a reminder on a task? Does it also notify you what your tasks are for the day?

 Preferably PHP/MySQL based, but anything that can run on a Ubuntu box. It doesn’t have to be secure or keep files for a long time.
 Any advice appreciated. Rgds,

 I'll try keep the story short, I found out that when MTU size is 1500 for IPv6 interface I have problems (some sites unreachable or takes forever to open, speed test on speed.measurementlab.net is abyssal) and if I set it to 1490 it is fixed. The problem is thought, that when I use the command:
 netsh interface ipv6 set subinterface "Ethernet 2" mtu=1490 store=persistent
 it works great, but after a few minutes it is back to 1500 and everything starts breaking again.. Does anybody know how I can make sure it stays 1490 ? I guess there's some "smart" functionality in windows that resets it for some reason ?
 P.S. The interface/subinterface is a "Remote NDIS compatible device" (I'm sharing my 5G mobile internet from my smartphone via USB Tethering if that gives any context.

 ​
 As of saturday all of the VM's on a single Hyper-V host have lost the ability to connect to the internet. Nothing has changed, no updates, no nothing. Eventviewer seems to be clean.
 The Hyper-V host has internet connectivity and we can ping the VM's from the host and from the VM's to the host but that's it. We have checked DNS (it never is DNS but everything in me is screaming it is...), LAN settings, everything... However we still cannot seem to find the issue.
 We even went as far to try and add google DNS or open DNS to one of the servers DNS server to no avail.
 ​
 Any pointers?
 ​
 EDIT (mostly for laughter)...: Router settings somehow got reset and was blasting DHCP over the network. This blocked everything. Turning DHCP off and restarting the servers solved everything. Still weird how nothing about this showed up in eventviewer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, I read about 802.11y-2008, including the FCC's "light licensing" scheme.
 Do actual, off-the-shelf products that someone can go and purchase as a semi-normal "off the shelf" item actually EXIST? Like, say (in descending order of sophistication & usability):
  
802.11n/ac to 802.11y-2008 router/bridge (so, two could connect to each other via 802.11y-2008, then "normal" wi-fi/ethernet devices could connect to one & communicate with devices connected to the other
 
PCIe (or mPCIe) 802.11y-2008 network card with working drivers for Windows & Linux (so, you could build a PC, install a pair of network cards... one for wi-fi or ethernet, one for 802.11y-2008, install Linux, and configure it AS a homebrew router/bridge).
 
Any half-baked (but working) FCC-approved module that can do 802.11y-2008 & interface via something like SPI, i2c, etc? Yeah, really scraping the bottom of the barrel here...
 
 Once or twice a year, I get in a new mood to see whether 802.11y-2008 finally exists yet. Every time, it seems like 802.11y-2008 has never actually existed anywhere besides as a theoretical paper standard. 
 Am I wrong?
 Example use case: splitting the cost of rarely-needed Starlink with a dozen or so people within a mile or two, shared via 802.11y-2008 backhaul, to bring the per-user-per-month cost down to something sane enough to get "for the hell of it" when some future hurricane knocks the local cellular network out of commission for days or weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: Thank you for the replies. I will ask for a change to cat 6, (he can say yes or no, then it's on him). They're going to work stations mostly but I just added some meeting rooms, etc., unspecified what actual devices they'll be using, assuming a PC per person. I'll do 2 per workstation. Cost isn't an issue as it's fake and the budget is almost irrelevant, just need to justify the design. 
 I'm in a networking course and part of the class is to design a medium-sized business network. We have never covered the logistics of physically laying out cables, business standards, parts necessary, etc. yet all of this is required for the assignment. So I apologize for this low level question but I have 0 real-world experience. The assignment specifies cat5e.
 My question is, when running the cat5e cables out, is there a standard number of cables per destination (to rooms, workstations, etc.), or should it be exactly as many as needed? Is it 1:1 end component per cable (like if a room is expected to have 5 PCs, should there be 5 cat5s, extra? twice as many?)?
 I've tried googling this and watched videos of people but I still haven't figured out a specific answer. I've read all the rules, I think this question is allowed. You don't have to explain it like I'm 5, I just literally don't know what real businesses do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've not worked with a lot of Network Teams directly, but I'm noticing they always seem to be very defensive and a bit isolationist with other departments.
 Is this a common theme everywhere? Or just a specific trend I've encountered? 
 If this is common, I'm guessing it's because everybody is always quick to blame "the network" and spending half their time proving that the faults are in fact. Not a network problem. Which I understand, it's just a frustrating when they get cagey, especially as once we're off work topics they tend to open up and actually talk to you easily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sys Admins of Reddit it’s been a year since I learned how to check the uptime on our company laptops. This year I learned that many help tickets come from users who go days, weeks, and months without restarting or shutting down their computers.
 Some insist they are shutting down, but the uptime logs states different. The high score I recorded so far is 135 days of uptime. I’ve had users complain they’re falling behind because of their computers performance speed. Users who don’t restart because restarting takes forever to boot. Users who insist they tried restarting multiple times before reaching out to the help desk. There are many examples but my favorite come from power users who try to resolve the problem without restarting thus making the issue more complex.
 I share with you all my journey of enlightenment. Though it may sound annoying, I love my career field.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone said sub going downhill thought I'd post this? Anyone use the sysinternal? 
 I use them at work and they've always come in useful. While working I'll sometimes put Mark Russinovich Case of the Uxexplained talks on and listen to them in background. Nearly all the time I'll suddenly hear a bit I've never noticed before.
 Remember in the old company I was in we had a weird issue on laptops only. Still on XP (they were behind. Was in about 2012) The user would go to explorer and the laptops would freeze for about 5 mins. Then eventually the network drives would appear. I'd grab process monitor traces where I could but instead of giving me time to look our manager would say "Just rebuild them. Don't waste time". Rebuilding them was a cocking waste of time.
 Eventually her own laptop got hit with the issue just as she was going on leave. So convinced her to let me look at hers. Ran process monitor as it happened but couldn't see anything obvious so ran process explorer. Just like in Task Manager you could see explorer at 50% but we all know task manager is useless. Looked into the explorer deeper with procexp and could see one .dll it was using running at 50%
 Ooo, could it be that? The .dll was being used by PGP the software we used to encrypt the laptops. Googled what the .dll did. All it did was scan the network looking for encrypted files so it could change their icon. We never used encrypted files so wasn't needed & apparently there were rare issues with it. So I unregistered it.
 Problem solved. Now instead of having to rebuild the laptops that took quite a while, I could fix them in under 5mins.
 I still take traces of issues wherever I can to look at them later. Started to build up a collection now and keep notes with the traces where I used the tools to fix issues.

 https://i.imgur.com/s5Bkwhj.png
 The AS has two networks, but for testing purposes I am announcing them in different VMs,
 VM1 advertises fdad:23e:f50::/48
 VM2 advertises fdba:54:32::/48
 Between VM1 and VM2 I have a wireguard tunnel and can reach/ping the networks
 In VM3 I would like to use network fdba:54:32::2/64, I have a wireguad tunnel between VM2 and VM3 and I can ping/reach the IP's.
 The problem I have is that from VM1 I can't reach VM3 and viceversa, this is my ospf config:
 VM2 configuration:
 protocol ospf v3 wg6 { ipv6 { export all; }; area 0 { interface "wg.4242421477"; interface "wg.stub"; }; } 
 VM3 configuration
 protocol ospf v3 wg6 { ipv6 { export all; }; area 0 { interface "wg.stub"; interface "ens192"; }; } 
 From VM3 (the stub) This is the output of show route for the IP In VM1
 bird> show route for fdad:23e:f50::1 Table master6: fdad:23e:f50::/48 unicast [wg6 17:35:44.984] E2 (150/20/10000) [217.160.50.77] via fe80::1:45:136:71:70 on wg.stub 
 How to use VM2 has the router between VM1 and VM2 ?

 I know there are other branches in the IT field, but I'm looking for something new to spark up my interest in IT again (my interest has been waning).

 I've been following this sub for a while but I have never posted anything.
 I request the help of a good soul to understand :) 
 Let me detail the situation : I am currently building a game server with i9 10850k and I am looking for a motherboard. I have choosen one, the SuperMicro X12SCA-F (pictured here) but I have some questions about adding a 10 GB network card on it.
 I have already an ASUS NVMe PCIe x16 Card, which allows me to add up to 4 NVMe Drives (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 lanes) destined to be mounted on the first PCIe slot (X16).
 Consequently, the 2nd PCIe x16 slot will be disconnected. Which leaves me one PCIe x4 Slot.
 I have found this Intel x550 T1 PCIe 3 x4 that seems to be ok to pair with, but I have 2 questions before I click to buy it :
 1 – How will a NIC plugged on this slot affect the latency of my internet connection since it is linked to the MB chipset (PCH) and not directly to the CPU ?
 2 – Is this slot shared with the M.2 slot or anything else ? In other words, do I have to expect some troubles or bottleneck from using this slot for my purpose ?
 Thanks a lot for your reply!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I'm the proud owner (haha) of a VPS that I'm intending to use as a thin client to access my machines over the net. So far, after checking my options, I'm leaning towards a solution including a VPN (probably OpenVPN over Wireguard due to the firewalls), Guacamole, and a Let's Encrypt autorenewal system to SSL' the whole thing.
 Process would be : connect machine A to VPN, use Guacamole on VPS, use VPN on VPS to connect to machine A.
 I'm now pondering what would be the best solution to handle this - and I like Docker quite a bit. So I'm asking here if there is a "full solution" already available for Docker (for what I searched, it's always "bits" : either there is VPN + Guacamole, either Guacamole + LetsEncrypt, etc. but not the whole thing), if I should install it on the machine without Docker, or if I should make my own Dockerfile.
 This is considering I want to set up some OTP (at least) to guard the thing off.
 What do you guys think? What would you suggest? Is there something easier?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started self-studying Computer Networks(5th edition), as the book mentioned Mobile IP, I have googled it over and over again and I just couldn't find any real-life implementations of it(except for researches and explanations), unlike DHCP that I can see real-life use cases of how it works when machines are connecting to a Wi-Fi .
 Is Mobile-IP common? or it is just a less practical protocol?

 The more we discuss these issues, the faster they will (potentially) get resolved.
 So, what applications, processes, OSes, functions have you seen break/misbehave with IPv6?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 apparently there is a function in the MS Office applications to send an email with the spreadsheet directly from the application (now I know it).
 Last month (a week after the August patches were applied) the first user from company A complains that this function does not work and an authentication window appears. -> enter AD credentials -> "general error - restart microsoft excel", window appears again. Tried domain-netbios\username, username@domain-fqdn and username only. Since it's not really a critical function, just dragging and dropping the file from File Manager into Outlook, I decided to put the ticket on hold until I have time to investigate.
 Today (Sunday) the 2nd manager of company B called me that this is not working, tried the same -> no success.
 My findings so far:
 - All systems with issues are Windows 2016 Server with Office 2016 (sometimes 32 bit, sometimes 64 bit), September Windows and Office patches applied, both RDS farms and Citrix systems.
 - The issue may have been introduced with the August patches and has not been fixed with the September patches.
 - Sending an email from Word works fine, Outlook opens and the user can write their message.
 - it's not user specific it's maschine-wide
 - it seems that only customers with on prem exchange have problems, IMAP / POP seems fine, exchange online is not used by our customers, so i can't test.
 - Googling was not really helpful -> only old articles with reinstalling Office.
 ​
 Does anyone else have a similar problem? Anyone have any ideas ?
 ​
 Edit: All systems are fully OnPrem with also fully patched DCs; If I add an pop / imap account to the outlook profile and make it the default one everything works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have just spend a whole day trying (and failing) to implement an internal CA setup. One offline Root and one intermediary to issue certs. I was following one or two guides I found on the internet.
 Turns out, internet outdates way too quickly. A test cert I issued to a website got outright rejected by Google Chrome (with no option to move forward) despite having the whole cert chain imported to my system. 
 I ran a cert lint tool on the certs using online (https://crt.sh/lintcert) tool, and it spew out so many errors, I was questioning my ability as a sysadmin. 
 I won't go into details of what the errors are since they are pointless at this stage. But stuff like mandatory Subject alternative names, and the abolishment of CNs, requirement for policy extensions, are some of the few things that have changed over the past few years, and none of the guides I used bothered to address any of this either.
 Hence, my question is, do any of you guys have a good reference guide that I can follow to create an internal CA the way the internet overlords intended in the current day and age, since apparently all the guides I have followed on the internet are all very much outdated. 
 And yes, I am aware I can bypass these warnings by manual adding to chrome, and using secret codes or whatever, but remember that this is going to be used in a real production environment so such work arounds are not a permanent solution. 
 P.S. For OpenSSL only please. I don't want to touch Windows ADCS.

 Going to be implementing a Root CA with ICAs for a company network and need some advice.
 The Root CA will be offline (it will live within XCA) and the ICA will be a Windows Enterprise CA.
 The certs will mainly be issued for machine auth, smart card auth and simple https web servers.
 What are the best practices today with regards to key type and cert expiry? Is RSA-2048 enough? I was thinking of going EC (ed25519) but apparently this has compatibility problems.
 How long does my RCA and ICA expiry need to be?
 I've seen the occasional 99 year RCA expiry but that can't be the right way to do things.
 I know that individual certs for websites can't be more than 398 days, but how about the rest?
 Would love to hear what you guys are doing.
 Thank you so much!

Something I’ve been wanting to do recently is see if it might be possible to write a custom host-based IDS in Python to analyze capture files for “indicators of compromise”. I was wondering if there are any straightforward parsing methods I could apply to a capture file that might simulate an IDS but instead using Pyshark? Maybe I just need to look into Wireshark forensics and copy those techniques? I’m new to all of this so if I sound naive, it’s because I am. If this sounds ridiculous or infeasible please let me know.

 Wondering if anyone has come across a solution to Sign-out Disconnected Users on Workstations after specified amount of time eg 8 hours. 
 I work at a hospital where we have multiple Nurses/Doctors signing into multiple computers and not logging out after their done for the day and account lockouts are a problem when it comes time for password changes or forgotten passwords. 
 Unfortunately turning off "switch user" is not an option as much as I'd love to. 
 There is an option in group policy for this exact problem but it only exists for Remote Desktop Servers... Great.
 Policy for Reference:
 Computer Configuration=> Administrative Templates=>Windows Components=>Remote Desktop Services=>Remote Desktop Session Host=>Session Time Limits.
 ​
 Any input would be much appreciated, Cheers Legends

 - OS
 - OS version/kernel version
 - Total disk space
 - Available disk space
 - IP address
 - Open ports
 - Current running processes
 - Battery percentage
 - CPU utilization over the last "x" hours
 - Users

 What else can be added ? It's for a group project and there are no fixed criteria

 And for the first time, I honestly feel like I am being paid what I am worth!
 I start Monday and it feels great, I have had a few roles in that time and each time I felt like I went for a “safe” role and when I started I soon realised that I could do a lot more than my job description. (Mainly think that is because some job job descriptions are far more broader than you actual responsibilities, if I saw SQL database, I would assume I needed to be a SME)
 Now I have gained some pretty desirable skills (such as PowerShell, Microsoft 365 expert, Cloud knowledge, etc) I went for a £50k role with no hesitation, it will be challenging but in a good way.
 And I feel like I will be far more motivated knowing I am getting a salary worth my knowledge, skills and experience.
 I also have been offered contract work on the side, which I’ve always felt IT was hard to side hustle.
 But my PowerShell and modern workplace knowledge has been very desirable as of late. All that training paid off!
 So this post is just to say… go for it, as long as you are willing and train when required, maybe that role your eyeing up will work for you.
 Wish me luck!

 Apologize in advance for my poor english skills, it is not my first language. However, I hope you could help with my issue:
 I have to update the company's DC so I did set up a a new DC with Win2022 as secondary DC, joined to the AD forest, and make sure the replication of AD Sites and Services, DNS, and GPOs were fine. The old one is a Win2012, I kept both running for a while, until I had some free time to decommission the old one.
 Finally, today I did transfer all the FSMO roles to the secondary DC make it as primary, the old DC is hosting the DNS server as well, so I added the new DC to each Forward Lookup Zone FQDN and changed the DNS in the network settings pointing our AWS Route53 (which I don't manage). At first, until the old DC was online and after I transferred the FSMO roles, all the clients and workspaces were able to resolve the new DC as DNS server, the group policies update correctly, everything looks fine. 
 Unfortunately, after I shut down the old DC, the new DC could not resolve out domain and lost the all the metadata it replicated before. Starting back the old DC resolved the issue, and everything went back to normal.
 Now I don't know what exactly where the issue is, I suspect this is something to do with the DNS but I really don't know what I missed.
 Thank you for your help!

 I hope all everyone is well.
 I started working for new company that is has more work done on SQL server administration. Mainly using Microsoft SQL. My job is more system administration side. 
 These area including installation & upgrade, basic query, backup & recovery, monitoring & optimizing, and security.
 I have very little knowledge on it and would like to learn from beginning to administrate them. Can you let me know if you know any possible training focuses on these, I couldn't find much quality reviewed based training on Udemy or YouTube.

 WiFi is Ruckus, about 250 APs. We’re not using tunnelling because of some issues with tunnelling.
 The issue we’re seeing is a drop of a couple of seconds whenever the handset roams from an AP connected to a switch to an AP connected on another switch. Roaming between APs on the same switch is fine.
 Has anyone here ever seen this issue? Is the 5406 that slow at updating its bridge forwarding table or is there some config/firmware issue?

 What do you do when you receive malware alert from one of your company workstation by antivirus alert server? 
 are you going to do manual scan by yourself ? or you do remote scan from the antivirus server ? 
 ​
 i am facing big problem here that my manager asking me to do a scan with 3 different sw's ( malwarebytes , KVRT and Mcafee antivirus ) 
 this means that i have at least 5 pc's every day to do the same process but i am really not convinced at all to do this .. this task should be automated ... at least to do remote scan from the antivirus portal .. that's why we have a centralized system for antivirus ( Mcafee EPO ) .. but they are forcing me to do manual scan at every singe pc in the company while we have more than 500 computers in the company . 
 what is the correct process we have to follow ? or what is the process you are doing at your company ?

 sorry for my bad English and i hope my question and my point understandable .

I was hoping someone could help me understand it on a larger scale though. Where all is a VLAN doing a push/pop through multiple hops? Does it have to do it at each hop, or can the trunk make it forward through a hop depending on configuration? The example im working with is through this network:
 Vlan 101.100 Nokia 7750 lag-2 > Nokia 7250 IXR-E Port 13 > Ciena 5142 Port 5> Ciena 3916 port 1 > CPE
 If someome could help explain through a network diagram they understand, with other MARs that would be fine also.

 Recently I assigned 6 new /16 supernets to some new Azure regions and it got me wondering if I will eventually run out of space... the thing is, after pondering it for a while, I realized that my organization would need to 10x in size before I even use up the 10.0.0.0/8 block...
 I imagine the mega corporations of the world may have a usecase, but from SMB up to some of the largest enterprises - it seems like adding unnecessary complexity with basically no gains.
 Here in the UK its very, very rare I come across an entry to intermediate level network engineer who has done much with IPv6 - and in fact the only people I have worked with who can claim they have used it outside of their exams are people who have worked for carriers (where I agree knowing IPv6 is very important).

 The customer has a Dell N3024 and has already a legacy VMware infrastructure connected to it using aggregation. Since his license is the Essentials Plus, it doesn't support Distributed Virtual Switches, only Standard Virtual Switches then I'm not able to use LACP, only static link aggregation.
 I set up the balancing mode to IP hash-based, I've defined as active the 3 uplink interfaces on the virtual switch. As soon as I activate the aggregation, I'm unable to ping the management interface until I undo it. I also think it's not a VLAN problem because the customer runs almost everything on the default VLAN. Is there some trick in Dell switches that needs to be done to the static link aggregation work properly with VMware? I'm asking it because we first tried to do the same configuration on a Dell PowerConnect 2824 and it also didn't work, then we moved the connections for this other switch where his legacy infrastructure is connected, but it isn't working also. Any ideas?
 Thanks in advance and have a nice weekend.

 I got a challenge with a new service of IPTV streaming source which is feeding from the access port of the provider's switch. It is L2 port without any IP address.
 The requirement is to push this stream source to all buildings which are connected via various L3 switches running ComwareOS, ArubaOS, ArubaOS-CX and Cisco IOS. I don't wanna use a single VLAN spanning across these buildings so I prefer to use a multicast routing protocol - pim dense mode.
 The problem is that how can I route multicast traffic from L2 VLAN to pim-dm protocol?! Can you please give me a suggestion/advice to archive this goal?

 What are the ramifications for renewing this thing? If I get the Enterprise Administrator cert, should I even worry about renewing the Messaging Administrator one or just let it go? Does it cost a lot for renewing? 
 I've only been in the industry for 2 years and I'm trying to transition to the systems/cloud administration side of things, helpdesk is far too easy, and I love working with Windows Server, Azure and 365 and was curious of anyone who perhaps has the MS100/101 cert how long is it valid for?

 We are looking for a service that we can self-host all of our data, in place with a sync client for Mac and PC that lets you see virtual\files on demand. 
 Synology Drive Server is working for us now. But it requires maintaining a completely redundant copy of all of the data on a Synology NAS just to be able to serve the data over Synology Drive. We use Syncthing to keep our Windows<>Synology in lock step and it's working but it's a fragile arrangement and requires redundant storage. 
 Sharepoint Server is the obvious choice for a cloud file server, however for just 8 users Sharepoint Server is $7,200/license + $150/user CAL = $16,000 it's from a cost perspective more expensive than buying a 250TB TrueNAS server and just doing the Syncthing dance.
 Resilio technologically looks great, but we only have 8 users and in order to get a Windows Server license you need at least 20 users which means we would be paying $200/mo. 
 OwnCloud and NextCloud offer exactly what we need, but back in 2017 they abandoned Windows. We could run them in a hypervisor, but then we'll need to duplicate the data into the VM and double our storage. 
 Qsync in QuTScloud would let us host a QNAP OS image in Hyper-V for a reasonable price per year but would also require us to duplicate our storage in the VM which means double the costs for hard drives. 
 Is there someone I'm missing who works with Windows Server and doesn't have crazy enterprise rates assuming that 80TB will only ever be needed by multinational corporations?

 Problems started when we started doing L3 routing + VXLAN and started loading up the switch with DAC cables when we started plugging in our Dev servers, and all our "Servers" (repurposed old workstations with 10GE cards). and started running Iperf 
 switches started locking up. Reboot is the only way to get it to respond. Disabling VXLAN fixes the issue. 
 We emailed the account manager and she got someone involved ASAP, they didn't even ask for any logs or TSRs and said it was a memory leak and sent us a new firmware that fixed the problem, 
 The fact of the matter is I've seen and heard of similar issues with Cisco switches, and routers that cost a lot more, what are your thoughts on this? 
 Personally, I don't think I will use this for prod or dev, and hope I can convince management to give me one so I can use it in my home lab :D.

 He takes one look at it and says, “Those are SAS drives and this server uses SATA. You got the wrong drives”
 Facepalm…….
 A quick google search reveals that you can use SATA with a SAS connector but not the other way around. A lesson I will never forget! 
 Luckily the customer wasn’t in a rush and my supervisor was cool about it besides laughing at me lol but I kinda deserve. Any other young inexperienced guys learn from my mistake on this one!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone else is going to run into this request, and the vendor's documentation is very frustrating. So here are some tips to help you along the way. 
 The Lexis Nexis has enabled support for modern auth in the Time Matters Exchange Sync tool, but in their article https://community.pclawtimematters.com/pclaw16/s/article/Exchange-Sync-ModernAuth
 they don't give you any information on the API permissions required. Instead, they direct you to ask a Certified Partner. 
 I wish they just said "The API needs to write/read the mailboxes using EWS with OAuth authentication" or really any indication of the required function/permissions.
 ​
 So, if you're trying to set this up: 
  
Install at least TM 16.6
 Create an Enterprise application in Azure, create a corresponding client secret
 Verify that OAuth2 is enabled for the tenant
 You need permissions for the API to Exchange Web Services using full_access_as_app
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-authenticate-an-ews-application-by-using-oauth#configure-for-app-only-authentication
 Reconfigure the Exchange sync on the server with the API values and verify the connection
 
 Hope this saves someone else some time. I wasted too much effort on this today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm setting some new Dell R650 servers, a couple of PowerSwitch switches and a Power store SAN. The Dell switches are configured for L2 and have trunk port connections to some L3 Cisco switches. I haven't worked with Dell equipment in years and my current employer has been an HP and Cisco shop in the past.
 So the servers have 2 dual 25GB port network cards, 1 port on each card is setup for Data and 1 port is setup for ISCSI/Vmotion/Vmanagement. I'm trying figure out when I should be using the VLT port channels with the connections.
 Should I use them for?
 1 - Two Data connections to each server
 2 - Two ISCSI/Vmotion/Vmanagement connections to each server
 3 - Two Trunk ports from the Dell switches to the Cisco L3 switches
 4 - For the Powerstore, it would seem like if you have only 1 connection per node, you would not use
 VLT? 
 Should I use two ports on each node and associate the two connections on each node with a VLT port channel?

 No complaints at all with EdgeConnect. Did everything I ever needed of it, simple enough to troubleshoot.
 ​
 Not a fan of Fortigate due to the fact it's a firewall by nature - Hence asymmetric traffic is dropped unless asymroute is enabled which is a large security risk for organizations running a single device/VDOM (and with iBGP and ECMP there's a lot of it during DR events....)
 ​
 So - What is everyones thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a fairly simple, but spread out network, a few HP 1930 switches, and a remote office 100feet away (cant get cable there) via wireless bridge, and then another few HP switches. 
 Spanning tree is on, happy and has been for 12+ months. Guy in remote office was moving furniture and not only found an 8 port cisco switch plugged in (not documented by people before me) but unplugged the POE on the bridge. Whatever, right?
 My entire network hiccuped for a good 5-10 seconds. HP Switches show entry of ‘Unit 1 elected as new STP root’. Ok.
 So, for the fun of it, I had the guy unplug the Ethernet on the POE, just to see what happens…and sure enough, 4-8 pings drop on my entire network. 
 I would have thought nothing would have happened on my end of things (main office), but it did. I want to blame this old cisco SG250 switch, which I looked up and shows STP on out of the box. But Im not sure.
 Ive ordered up a new HP switch to replace it, and it should be here in a few days, but im just wondering what is going on and asking you guys for some insight if you have any. Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I apologize if this has been asked before, but trying to search this topic I am finding a lot of results not exactly related to my questions that have been bothering me the past few days.
 I am having a difficult time comprehending the difference between untagged and "no-untagged" on an HP switch. I want to be sure I am understanding what the configuration means, and I'm not just continuing to copy what I see just because it works. I do understand how vlans and tagging work for forward traffic and separate it between different subnets. Something "tagged" for a vlan I understand fine. But when doing a show run on an HP switch, I am seeing the labels "no untagged" and "untagged" listed, and that is throwing me off. 
 When I see the words "no untagged" it makes me think that a port that is untagged cannot be part of this vlan (therefore only tagged ports can go here), and untagged means they are not part of that vlan. But then again, why would anyone need to specify a port is untagged? Wouldn't it be implied it is untagged on that vlan unless it is manually tagged?
 Below is an example (keep in mind, I didn't set these up):
 vlan 1
 name "DEFAULT_VLAN"
 no untagged 1-22,25-52
 untagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 5
 name "MGMT"
 tagged 23-24
 exit
 vlan 9
 name "PC"
 untagged 1-2,4-10,12-15,18-22,26-40
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 10
 name "DATA"
 untagged 3,11,16-17,25,41-52
 tagged 1,23-24,28-40
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 11
 name "VOICE"
 tagged 1,23-24,26-40
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 12
 name "SecWIFI"
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 13
 name "GuestWIFI"
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit

 And then something happens, which throws a wrench into everything and makes me second guess everything. 
 Today that was me. I came to work, no-touch-Fridays and got through some tasks, and my nagios screen went red. Like…a lot of red.
 Came back about 2 minutes later…weird.
 About and hour later, same thing. This time I could see a pattern of what was down…a remote site and everything AFTER it went down. I called the site, no answer, which is normal sometimes people are not there. 
 I start logging into switches, seeing some Spanning Tree stuff in the logs, nothing too out of sorts. Sweating a bit, wondering wtf is going on…do I know spanning tree enough (does anyone?) whats going on here. 
 About another hour goes by and I finally get a callback. The site was moving furniture and powered everything down..including the ‘splitter’. The what? You don’t have a switch there. Turns out the people before me put in a 8 port switch and stuck it behind the desk. I look it up, its a smart-ish switch with spanning tree, and older than dirt. No documentation saying its there, or what its doing. But its powered back up and everything is working much better now. 
 Monday they get a new switch…but until then I need to calm down.

Until someone comes in your office and has to mention their desk phone and Ethernet isn’t working. We use POE sip phones in the office btw. Well what do you mean the phone isn’t working, is their no dial tone? No he says, the phone has no power at all. 
 This immediately peaked my interest with a small side of anxiety and dread as to what I might discover. So I walk over to that side of the office. We have a whole floor of a building and this was on the opposite side from my office. We have 3 core Poe switches on our side and have a fiber circuit running too a single 48 port poe switch. 
 Too make the long story short, the single Poe switch decided to kill itself. Luckily we got a few data only ports to work for the printers. Otherwise the marketing team would have murdered us. So not the end of the world, but I swear it’s always on a damn Friday. A few years ago we got hit with ransomeware towards the end of the day…on a Friday. That was fun.

 I've recently received an opportunity, and I'm not sure what to do with it. 
 I chanced into my IT role at my work, and it's a government job with a pension at the end of it. The crew is great, and I have awesome work/life balance (which is why I joined in the first place). But, the pay stinks (I knew this going in, I had a 30% pay cut from my previous employer), even though we are in a union. 
 Received a call with our main vendor for our computer database system and are curious if I would like to join them for 2x my current pay (35k) (which isn't a lot, I'm on food stamps) and the work would be remote. 
 My chief worry is the economy. Sure the job doesn't pay well, but it's secure. And I fear a possible recession. I see advice on this thread all the time that the best way to get a raise is to change jobs, but I've also been reading that now may not be a great time to do so. 
 And, I'm a loyal employee, loyal to a fault, which in the United States, I know conceptually, is a very bad thing to be, but I still feel emotionally that I'm betraying the trust of my coworkers and team. 
 I'm scared to even ask for more details on the job offer. I'm stressed now, due to my family finances, so I'm worried that I may make a rash move. 
 Sigh, any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Does anyone here working independently carry some kind of liability insurance? Like contractors, electricians, etc?
 I got a position in the company I've been in for the past decade, but still kept my LLC active for larger consulting jobs I get every now and then.
 I've been getting a few referrals for medical and dentistry practices, which involve HIPAA. Since there are no official definite guidelines for security standards (that I know of), there is a lot of price negotiation and options when I'm in the analysis and design phase. For instance, moving the server/network rack (which is currently a shelf and desk in the water/air pump closet without a locking door) into a lockable, secure cabinet.
 So, I've been wondering if anyone knows my liability exposure for any "compromises" I make in the design and if anyone has insurance for things like this, or something else.

The only real concern that I can think of that pertains to us is Hipaa (due to customer data files). We have Hipaa covered. I'm not sure what policies/procedures we should have in place. Exchange online has a 'Compliance Manager'. Does that play a role? Any guidance on getting written policies is greatly appreciated.

 So I passed my CCNA in February and then got a decent Network Admin job right after. It's insanely clear that the CCNA was not nearly enough to consider myself a good Network Admin and I'm learning stuff every day but I want to actually study things so I know it in advance or know topics better before I learn through screwing something up and having a higher level Network Admin save me.
 My job is almost purely in Cisco ASA, dealing with VPN troubleshooting. I decided to study a concentration exam in VPNs for CCNP but I'm noticing I still have issues understanding things like NAT/PAT and more advanced routing (not routing protocols, just routing in general). I feel I have a great deal of understanding in how these things work but once I start troubleshooting individual issues I become lost quickly.
 Are there any suggestions on study materials? Books or exams to go for, YouTube videos that helped you understand specific topics much better?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently a sysadmin who has been approached by a head of another department offering me an opportunity to be one of his many project managers.
 He's aware I have zero PM experience but must've heard good things about me, coupled with a good impression he has of Mr through the limited dealings we've had with each other.
 He's told me he's approached me because he thinks I've got the soft skills required to flourish in the role, and has assured me that I can be brought up to speed as a junior PM and I won't be thrown in at the deep end.
 My salary would remain the same, he's already done the ground work with upper management to ensure I wouldn't get a paycut despite going from senior sysadmin to junior PM.
 The role itself sounds like something I'd enjoy and it seems a good opportunity I otherwise wouldn't get to experience something completely different.
 Has anyone here made a similar switch, or have any thoughts? 
 I'm seriously considering it as I have some insider information that our PMs have a much higher earning potential in my org. Many of them earn more than my boss, so I already feel like I may be hitting the ceiling in this role as far as growth is concerned.
 My main concern would be my skills in this industry fading should I wish to return/end up disliking PM roles, but the fact the company will bring me up to speed and the earning potential is higher is making me think I should really consider this and take the (seemingly low) risk.
 Any input greatly appreciated! 
 Thanks all and have a great weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have the option of purchasing a VPS with a 100Mbps connection and another with a 1Gbps connection. I’m creating an application that communicates with a fintech API and latency is key. So far, I have obtained a 1.2 ms latency to the target API’s server using the 100Mbps, which is ideal. However, I am wondering if latency is a good enough measurement or if there will be significant advantages of using the 1Gbps connection. Each payload is around 2Kb.
 Would there be a huge difference between the 100Mbps connection and the 1Gbps given that the ping latency is around 1.2ms on both?
 If there isn’t a significant difference, I’d rather pay for the 100Mbps VPS as it is substantially cheaper, and this is a personal project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last year I've seen an increasing amount of spam originating from Gmail. I'll go so far as to say Gmail appears like a haven for spammers. Since Gmail holds a huge chunk of the worlds email accounts/domains, I can't resort to my standard blocklist approach, and spam is seeping through my other filters and ends up with users.
 I've tried reporting the spam to abuse accounts such as [abuse@gmail.com](mailto:abuse@gmail.com). That did nothing except get one of our mailservers on a gmail blocklist (lots of lost emails). (I can't 100% guarantee there was a correlation, but the timeline fits very well..) I've tried to report through web forms as well, but most are focused towards spam coming into gmail from the outside.
 Does Gmail just don't give a shit, or is there a way to get something done?

Initially I noticed there were a lot of CRC errors on the interface so we changed the cable which seemed to sort the problem. Now though, we have the same error again on the AP portal saying that the AP is unable to reach the cloud. I did a shut/no shut on the interface (which worked prior to changing the cable) but that hasn't helped. The MAC address isn't detected on the port to which it's connected (Cisco switch) and I've tried pinging the but the interface was showing as up/up.
 I then noticed that the speed was 100Mb/s. I've changed that to 1000Mb/s but now the interface is showing as down/down and a shut/no shut isn't bringing it up. All metrics on the interface look fine and nothing at all has changed in terms of configuration. Anything I have missed?

 So i have got a physical SCCM build which i now need to transfer to a virtual environment and create VDPs.I have started working and striping all physical related stuff and leave only the relevant.
 I have got assistance from a Citrix resource however i am not 100% sure they are telling me what the capabilities are and how we can do this optimally. Unfortunately i got no clue about Citrix.
 So we are going to build into the Virtual environment and that machine is gonna be captured and then fed into MCS and then clone it.
 What i am worried about is how do i transfer all the things i have stripped of the main build to the VDP build. For example specific languages. Can i have a PowerShell script run during MCS and do all that? 
 How do you guys go about this kind of challenges ?

 We had an elaborate phishing breach. Led to nothing but will lebaorate on what they did and I want advice of what else we can do, or even buy to help reduce. We are a MS 365 house
 ​
  
User in question is in finance.
 User was recently scammered personally.
 User was tricked (we suspect she may have been using same passwords for everything) to approve MFA. MFA was set as phone. The initial entry point we think they either had tested her password as got from the initial, non company scam or a phshing email pre Avanan being turned onto the max and slipped through MS quarantine.
 Scammer got in (using a IP on same country) and set a rule for correspondance on a "shared finance mailbox"
 2 weeks later...logged in and started correspondance with a cutsomer as set in the rule about bank details.
 Bank details were changed but we got altered and was started.
  
Shared mailbox had 13 plus people in so took me time as shared maiboxes dont have great auditing. Eventually located, blocked, changed passwords, altered MFA, coverted this mailbox to a licensed etc. The whole company is about to have all passwords changed and MFA sessions revoked.
 We already do:
  
Yearly training std
 Atleast 2, if not 3 fake phishing tests a year that lead to extra training
 We have Avanan in place since Sept. Note, was not placed inline till after the initial breach. 
 I block most countries hence how they go in via IP address in this country via a VPN
 Shed load of alerts on 365 but a a since instance, not sure any alert would have trigged unless I do alerts on any rules adding into a mailbox (we have 600+ mailboxes, rising to 2500 shortly.
  
Any AI solution that could help?
 Would EDR/XDR in any way?
 Move shared mailbox correspondances to helpdesk solution eg freshdesk?
 Open to comments as going to present to board what I need and why.
 Thanks in advance.

 Currently trying to work a solution for a client, cisco platform all around - and best idea is to use IPSec VTI tunnels. This particular install is using Starlink business so we should get the public IP direct on the cisco, but we may have a need to do it on residential which is CGNAT stuff with dynamic IP's .
 Whats the best solution here?
 I've previously tried l2tp VPN over residential starlink, and found the tunnel was limited to about ~30mbps, not sure if this was an unrelated issue, but other VPN's to the same concentrator did not have any issues, so I thought perhaps starlink was PCQ the tunnel (seeing it as a single flow).
 Just keen to hear peoples experiences so I can push myself to the right solution.

 The generator powering the server room and some of the cubicles fired up automatically when the power dropped ( funnily enough we were planning to do a generator test tonight) so we got the staff redistributed to cubicles with power, set-up a few printers and everything is going along as well as can be expected at the moment.

 The database had 3 sections with routes. Type 1, type 2, and type 5. So I looked at one of the /25 networks being advertised as a type 5 lsa and saw the the advertising router, the boundary I was one, was hosting that /25 SVI itself! That's where I got confused since the side of the network I could see is area 0. 
 I'm a visual learner and couldn't picture where those type 5s were going and why they exist. Could someone explain this scenario to me?

We have Palo Alto 3220 firewalls and are trying to get 2 fiber connections to work. 2 x 1G dia fiber connections from 2 different ISP’s. We are not certain the issue is the transceivers, but we are leaning that direction. No link lights on the ports, etc. We have tickets out with both ISP's and hope to have answers soon.
 We have 2 different SFP transceivers and both act the same way. 1 type is generic from Amazon that was supposed to work with most major hardware providers. We brought them along as backups. The primary module is from FS.com and is supposed be PA compatible and has the PA designation like we expected.
 Does anyone in the Phoenix area have any Palo Alto compatible Singlemode 1310nm LX/LR - 10km transceivers with LC connectors? We would need them asap, our flights leave 5pm phoenix time on Friday 9/30.
 Does anyone have any other ideas or access to a vendor in the area that could help?

 Apologies in advance for being pretty new to networking.
 My situation is as the title states.
 How I got here was we are preparing for a merger and we were asked to add the DNS suffixes to the dns search list of our two source domains and our Target domain via GPO
 Doing this seems to cause the primary DNS suffix to be the first one in that search list
 To try and get around that I tried to define the primary as what it should be per domain.
 But after doing that, DNS only seems to be working with FQDN.
 Not sure what is causing this but if anyone has any input I would want to hear it. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just had to work an incident where some VOIP phones stopped working. I get on the local router and switch and notice I can't ping the call manager. I check the routing table and I see the route to the subnet the call manager sits in right but there is also a /32 route for the call manager coming from NHRP, we do use DMVPN. 
 Visual with made up IPs
 B 192.168.2.0/24 via 172.16.16.10
 H 192.168.2.10/32 via 172.16.16.2
 So in this example the 172.16.16.10 is the dmvpn address of the call center's router and 172.16.16.2 is the dmvpn address of a secondary headend. 
 Now yes there is also a problem with why the secondary headend we are standing up doesn't have a route to the call center itself, making this just inefficient routing not broken, but I'm mostly confused by how NHRP just decided to advertise a route to a somewhat random server. I just threw a static route in to fix it for now but I would like to figure out the cause.
 This is my first time working at a company with DMVPN so I'm still learning the ins and outs.
 Thanks

Now it is a scramble to find new coders and admins for the mainframe hardware as the current workers are retiring. IPv6 has been around for decades but pretty much every site and every company in the world still uses IPv4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to see if this is even possible what's being asked. We're wanting to set up some VM hosts at a separate site to replicate to for failover so if Site 1 goes down then we can continue to use our VMs at Site 2. These sites are connected via a layer 3 fiber link. Currently the VM hosts and the VMs themselves are all on the same subnet/vlan. Is there a way to recreate that subnet at site 2 or would they conflict with one another since the two sites are still technically connected?

 Is it better to have all the cables drop to the bottom of the rack, and then come back up to feed into the panels, or to feed the cables directly into the panels as they drop down? I've seen it done both ways, so I'm not really sure what the "preferred" method is.

I can get to this box no issues when I'm in prem from different vlan. When I'm vpn'd in i can get to the gateway (10.9.9__1) and a couple other devices in the same network JUST not this particular box. I look at the firewall logs and 80 and icmp are green going to this box. From the ubuntu box i can even ping the vpn box from the ubuntu, not vice versa. I've even tried a win10 laptop, gave it the same IP and i'm not able to get to it thru vpn as well. gave it a different one and it's good! 
 As far as path goes, vpn -> fw-> core -> access switch-> box. the 10.9.9.x network is L2. i'm not a linux guy so i'm not sure if there's an internal (i doubt it because i have access to it on-prem). i'm clearly missing something here. fw rule, routing, something.

 And that's where the fun starts. So many external services we rely on don't support IPv6. Github for one doesn't. Docker's registry doesn't. Most of the CPAN mirrors (yeah, we use Perl in a few places) don't. A lot of Ubuntu's repository mirrors don't. It's actually easier to list the things that *do* support it than the things that don't, it's a sad and very small list. 
 So tell me, how to transit to a full IPv6 stack when 90% of external services flat out don't support it, and (in Github's case at any rate) don't seem too interested in getting it to work?

Our current switching environment is HPE and Aruba based. By default, the ports do not trust DSCP. To enable QoS to give VOIP traffic priority, is it just a matter of enabling DSCP port trust on all switches end to end for it to begin working? Currently, we are not coming anywhere close to saturating our current backbone links, but I'd like to just have QOS setup properly just in case.

We do have great Verizon connections on our phones though so I think some kind of LTE modem would be sufficient. I have worked with Cradlepoint IBR900's in the past and was thinking of just getting one of them. My problem is that our room where the internet and camera equipment will be stored is right in the middle of the home, where the LTE connection suffers.
 ​
 My question is this: Is there an antenna system or something we could use to place the antennas outside on the side of the home and run that back to the IBR900 placed in the middle of the home? Or another solution that would work with this setup?

I apologize if I don't word things correctly when trying to explain this, but honestly the most I've done on phones has been static configs and configuring switchports for VoIP VLANs. This rollout we have ESXi, VMs, we're configuring Option 150 on a server, and I need to figure out where to point the ip-helper for the VoIP VLANs (there are about 12 but they should all point to the same whatever will be acting as the DHCP server; my problem is I don't know what that is. On the last setup it was the CME on a Cisco 3925 router. (Sorry if I didn't word that correctly.) I was told specifically by the vendor (Presidio) that it would not point to the router this time, but she didn't know where to point it either. I'm looking for suggestions and your experience in helping me answer the question of where to direct my ip-helper on my VoIP VLAN configs. Our server admin says he configured our internal DHCP scope on a server (on a server VLAN and not a VoIP VLAN, and don't internal DHCP scopes only assign to to those in it's own subnet? ) but the only time I’ve heard of internal DHCP has been for wireless so that doesn’t sound right. I know it’s supposed to be a L3 device but if it’s not the router, then I’m lost again.

 I checked all jabber settings, my speaker and microphone settings and kept testing it over and over after the first call where I couldn't hear. 
 I was able to dial and talk to team members and make outbound calls and hear them but when a customer would call me I would not hear it. It was bizarre. I know the wifi password was changed a few days prior for some reason at the office. So whenever I received an inbound call from anyone who wasn't on my team I could not hear voice
 When I went back home I was able to hear them when they called. With no settings changed or nothing different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 This VPN is insanely slow compared to connection speeds and I am having a hard time finding a reason why. Keep in mind I'm a junior sysadmin at best so I'll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. 
 Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.
 Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:
 Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.
 Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.
 CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%
 Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.
 Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.

 This is something I haven't had to do before, so I am just trying to get some advice on how to tackle a project like this. Not so much asking for phone system options (although I am open to recommendations), but rather tackling a large IT project in general. Any advice on breaking the project down, or standards for laying things out and planning? What programs do you use to layout plans? Resources for project planning?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 This VPN is insanely slow (93.2% overhead) compared to connection speeds and I am having a hard time finding a reason why. Keep in mind I'm a junior sysadmin at best so I'll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. 
 Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.
 Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:
 Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.
 Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.
 CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%
 Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.
 Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a service provider providing DIA and MPLS services. We have a customer to which we will provide a redundant service using dual CPE's. He wants to run BGP towards us. Usually we use VRRP towards the customer on the CPE's in redundant cases, eBGP between the CPE and the PE, and iBGP between the CPE's (over the customer LAN).
 So if we are going to run BGP towards the customer, what would be the best practice way of setting it up? iBGP / eBGP towards the customer? iBGP / eBGP between CPE and PE? Or is there some other way of doing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to learn DSC and was using this quickstart by MS: Quickstart - Convert Group Policy into DSC - PowerShell | Microsoft Learn on a standalone VM.
 It uses the PS Module BaselineManagement to create an MOF and PSD1 file from GPO. The PSD1 script output by that process has all the HKLM registry changes under a 'RegistryPolicyFile' type. When I apply the configuration to the VM, it modifies the local GPO Pol file and does a gpupdate, but not all the reg changes are made. No errors or issues, and DSC says its compliant.
 If I edit the PSD1 script by changing all the 'RegistryPolicyFile' to 'Registry' it actually makes the changes.
 Am I missing something here? Why isn't the local pol file working? Should I be leaving the MOF to update the Pol file and troubleshoot local group policy, or should I be editing the script like I am and directly update the registry? Your insight would be appreciated!
 ​
 This is the setting I was troubleshooting. If the reg is present, the user can't change the setting. If I use this as RegistryPolicyFile, the user can change the setting.
 RegistryPolicyFile 'Registry(POL): HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WarnOnBadCertRecving' { ValueName = 'WarnOnBadCertRecving' ValueData = 1 ValueType = 'Dword' TargetType = 'ComputerConfiguration' Key = 'HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings' }

 Im struggling with an azure problem for a while now. I have a backup from a server in china that in the past (on different hardware) worked without issue. 
 We've made quite a few changes (none that i think should affect azure as it works on other remote sites without issue) 
 Any how- scenario is, I take a file backup to a azure vault, the backup fails almost immediately if not a few minutes into the job, LSASS on the server crashes forcing a reboot and the cycle repeats. 
 I have tried a different virtual server with the same data same issue. 
 I get an email from azure with this error - 
 The current operation failed due to an internal service error "Authentication Failed". Please retry the operation after some time.
 Which i believe is simply because LSASS fails. 
 I'm looking for some guidance on where to pull a thread as im out of ideas.

 In august, a new employee was onboarded to my company's sister company.
 I was in charge of purchasing his assets.
 I called him and asked what laptop he wanted. 17" he said, because of client visits and being able to have presentations on it when not being able to connect it to a bigger screen.
 Found a model, checked in with him and he said okay to said model.
 Not two hours after the purchase was complete, he called from a store and had seen another model that costed 1k more than the one he chose previously. He wanted that one instead. Informed him that the computer already has been shipped, and if he needed this one instead, he has to contact his manager and get it approved.
 His manager did not approve.
 Of course he needed a phone. No issue there. But he wanted a additional SIM. For his car.
 I obliged and sent him a extra SIM card.
 A couple of days ago he visited our office and had yet a request; he wants an iPad too. Informed him that he has to talk to his manager to get that approved.
 Today, he called. Now he wants another SIM. For his iPad (that I don't know if his managers approval, if he bought it for himself or how he solved it).
 I told him No. Told him to make a hotspot on the iPhone and connect the iPad to said hotspot.
 Now, my manager told me that this guy has a purchase block.
 ​
 This guy's audacity has no bounds.
 What similar experiences do you have?

 To lock the screen setup:
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Configuration 
 There you will see every monitor you've connected so far, so open all of them. You will find a folder labeled "00". Open them also and you will also find a sub-folder also named "00" (remember, for every monitor there will be this kind of folder and sub-folder)
 Search for the key labeled "Rotation" and you will notice it has it's data set to 1 which it's the default. Below you may see the data related to the corresponding screen orientation:
 1 = Landscape
 2 = Portrait
 3 = Landscape (flipped)
 4 = Portrait (flipped) 
 Auto rotation:

 0 = On
 1 = Off

 They had been on vacation for 2 weeks, they weren't pingable, and I couldn't even see their car on Netcloud or their MDT on my RMM.
 Got there and the Cradlepoint was handling out its default subnet, couldn't ping through it, and I couldn't get into the unit as it appeared to be factory reset. Had to spend an unreasonable amount of time dismounting it to find the default on the rear of it.
 Logged in and I was greeted with a subscription expiration.
 Cradlepoint will reset your device to factory defaults, and NOT PASS ANY TRAFFIC OF ANY SORT without a subscription.
 I heard this had happened a few firmware versions ago.
 But, WE WERE CURRENT and had been for years! It was a licensing issue on their side that just randomly took a license away from it, no notice of any sort, no indication on the main screen.
 Beyond unacceptable and will be replacing all of them next year. Sierra's Netcloud is a little lacking for templating, but I will absolutely not have a mission critical device stop working entirely, requiring an on-site visit to find out a fucking subscription issue for a router. I'm sure folks on Meraki are familiar with this, but I'm not doing it for infrastructure.

 Sorry for the bad english, baguette here.
 So, with all this home office stuff going on, I have to find a way to let a new user log in to a computer at home. Right now I have to connect to windows using their account while in the office and connected to the company network. Not great.
 I saw that you could connect to windows using the Azure AD account but I don't understand where to start to allow this in my company.
 Do I have to migrate everything to azure AD and stop using my on-prem AD ? Can I configure it using Azure AD connect without touching my current AD infrastucture ? Like I said, I find a lot of documentation about all of this but I don't understand where to start exactly and it's driving me nuts.

 Our use case:
  
send 100k+ transactional emails (register, password, etc) per month
 support SPF, DKIM and DMARC to not get blocked
 use SMTP or HTTP API to send emails
 store a copy of the outgoing email if delivered successful
 receive response emails (fail-after-delivery, out-of-office, manual replies)
 less moving parts (happy to just store emails in files)
 optional: POP/IMAP to access sent and received emails
  
No, I do not want to use an external service, I want it on-premise.

 I know they support USB key unlocking but I am also exploring other suggestions/solutions. 
 1- All staff have RFID cards for elevator access. Is it possible to use the same cards to lock/unlock the smartboards?
 2- Is there a way to have the smartboard only be functioning/unlocked as long the USB key is plugged? (Like a car’s ignition)

 We need to allow multiple end users, take a photo and upload it to only their specific user folder which they have access to. So I'm thinking a cloud based storage product where i just pay for how much storage i want rather than by user (as that is where it gets expensive, be about 150 users). That product would sync to on-prem AD. The users would log into the app with their domain user/pass and then only be able to see the one folder in the cloud storage product which they have access too where they can simply just add a photo.
 I presume this is quite a easy task but if anyone has any recommendations that would be fantastic.

 ​
 When I trace the path towards 8.8.8.8, I can ping each hop with +1500 MTU, (above 1472 in windows ), but at a specific hop stops it and starts dropping. Why is the packet simply not fragmented when it goes over 8.8.8.8, but it is fragmented when I ping other addressess like 1.1.1.1 . Im so confused.

 And just to add, I'm not using 'Do not fragment flag.', just normal ping with extra size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In case it matters: The region is The Netherlands, Europe.
 About 5,5 years ago I started my IT career fresh out of school. I didn't know anything and learned everything on the go starting with level 1 servicedesk at a ~25-man MSP. Over the past years I managed to step up and implement/solve more complex stuff. I went from rookie to network engineer configuring routers, firewalls and switches in complex setups. On the side I also was "un-official" teamlead of support by now. Teaching the new guys the ropes - I was the go to guy for most people to come to who were at our office. It became taxing on me: The workload was high and this made the place unsociable. The mandatory on-call shifts (one full week every 6 weeks on average) were very busy too, often clocking 4-8 additional hours outside of regular times. On top of that the pay was bad too, fairly below market average for a lot of employees on the team (people talked about it which management did not like of course, berating those who discussed it).
 Upcoming Monday I am starting a new job, I am leaving the MSP world and starting as a sysadmin at a company with about 85 employees. Working 36 hours (49) for about the same pay I got when working 40 hours (58). There is one other sysadmin who has been there for about 8 years now and the focus of the company is software development for a webservice they are hosting.
 The reason I am posting this is to gather input of other people who have made the same switch, how did life change for you? Did you run into surprises, is there any advice I should hear?
 Any input/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.

 Now only the html5 url is present.

 Let's say I have a big bloaty ps1 file I want to split up. However, I don't want to declare $vars in every file - just the parent one.
 How do I pass those $vars to the new script? Or... am I crazy and this already happens if it spawns from a parent script?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I keep having this predicament with job applications. I have around 4 years experience in first line support but for very unique roles where I was pretty much the one and only go to IT guy who did everything so in reality I have more experience than my CV shows apart from that I have so much training in different technologies it's hard to cram in a CV.
 Now the problem I having it's that I'm trying to move from first line to second line support but recruiters keep telling me I might not have the experience to make the jump but then when I apply for any first line position they tell me I'm over qualified and they are afraid of me leaving after a short time. 
 After rejecting my application one of the interviews email the below to me as one of the reasons for my rejection: 
 "We liked your example of the achievement you are most proud of, you clearly have a solid ‘second line’ skill set, and your response at the end about what you could offer also came across well."
 Not to mention they actually said it during the interview which gave me a good hint I wasn't going to be selected.
 What can I do or say to first get through recruiters that doubt my experience and second show the company I have the skills and training for second line? 
 By the way in my are the jump in salary from first line to second line could be something from 22K to 38K.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got an alert from my Barracuda appliance around 10:48PM CST saying my queue exceeded the threshold I set. Ah oh, mail wasn’t getting to my Exchange boxes. So I did all the usual troubleshooting and internally everything was fine. External email was getting to the Barracuda ok but not being delivered to exchange. All “tests” passed and the Barracuda could send me test emails. I also discovered if I re-queued a message it would go back to deferred but if I skipped the scan engine and just flat out deliver it, the mail would show up… Must be something with email scanning so I reboot the appliance. That doesn’t fix it so I call Barracuda and open a case. The tech said he’s been doing it these calls all night. They pushed out a bad update and I locked up a scanning engine service. A reboot doesn’t clear it. I had to start up the troubleshooting remote connection so the tech could push out an update and restart the service. I couldn’t have done it myself as they lock that ability behind support.
 TLDR: If you’re having trouble with external emails getting stuck in the queue on your Barracuda after Wednesday night, then call support. They pushed a bad update.

 I'm wondering if anyone out there is having users use passwordless authentication for Office 365 and not providing any password to the user. As in, getting the user setup with a basic password, setting up the authenticator and phone sign in, then changing the password to something random and just having the user use phone sign in with MFA policies. 
 Has this worked out at all for you? We seem to be considering this after the uber/rockstar hacks + some other issues on our side.

 I used to work in IT as a sysadmin/net admin/architect, but no longer due to medical stuff (been out of the game about 5 years now).
 For the last 20 years or so of my career, I worked in consulting shops before there were MSP's, and then MSP's until my career came to an end.
 The shops I worked in were focused on the SMB space, and ranged in industry from manufacturing, oil and gas (upstream and downstream), construction, medical, legal, service, hospitality, retail and even IT dev operations and data centers.

 So again, how long into your guys career did it take for you to feel like, “yeah, I get most of this.” Just feel like maybe I’m behind in terms of getting into cyber security because of networking.
 Also, thanks so much ahead of time for your guys answers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, after 9 years of being a help desk dipshit I have just started at a company where I am now the sole IT guy and they haven't had one before. The guy who was doing anything with tech is my manager, the director of operations. There's a couple of people who have slapped together some scripts, and my manager's experience is somewhere around "has built a gaming PC". They use an MSP for managing anything that's above my manager's capacity and my job is to bring that in house.
 Honestly I'm really liking it. It's a small company of around 60 users and I've got a whole list of projects to accomplish and I've added a couple of my own ideas to the list, I think I can really tighten things up and get them running a bit more smoothly, get some disaster recovery procedures in place, etc. I'm feeling strangely confident in my ability to do what is being asked of me. That's not what I'm here for today.
 I'm only a few weeks in and this company hasn't really had an actual IT guy before, they've just had Chad the Ops Guy calling vendors. So, in order to help ease myself into a company that has a few decades of experience running but zero experience having an actual IT guy I want to do some user training of sorts. I want to do a sort of informal getting to know you and you getting to know me and what I can do with the title and theme being the title of this post.
 I have a few ideas for what sort of stuff goes in there, but I'd love to have your input. Folks who have started at small companies that haven't had IT people before them, what are the weird growing pains as companies get used to your presence? What won't the company expect about what my position brings to the table? I'm looking to bring some funny too, I figure anytime you're asking the users to change If you can make them laugh a little while you do it then it goes over better.

 Perhaps this is specific to Australia or the scale of the businesses dealt with but my experience and the consensus of those in other businesses and organisations here seems to be physical security companies are disorganised.
 E.g. tickets, tasks, requests are lost in limbo unless called directly and repeatedly followed up if not a simple fix. Doesn't matter if throwing money at the provider still some tasks are lost.
 I've noted they often seem to not have any sort of ticketing system. 
 Often breaking systems while doing a fix for another task only to often try and charge to fix the system that was broken by them previously or not implemented correctly.
 Don't blame the workers just seems like poor management, poor direction, keeping on top of modern processes and systems etc.
 Is this universal? Specific to the size of security companies or just an Australian issue?

 It is nice and has a lot of features through the portal, but still couldn't figure out how to change IP without having to restart it and interrupt the internet, if that's possible to do on that, at all.
 On the old modem portal, I could just click on disconnect and reconnect in a section in portal and the IP would change without any restart.

 I’m flying solo at a small, private K12 and most of our cables are running the obstacle course around air ducts, electrical conduit, fluorescent light fixtures, and a bunch of other crap, often lying on top of (and obstructing) the ceiling tiles.
 Im curious about standard methods, code requirements, and materials I could buy to make it easier/faster/better/safer (maybe raceways?). Please advise.
 Update: Evidently, they make cable trays. That’s what I was imagining: easy entry/exit, well supported, easily mounted.

 Typically big files are sent via email weekly, and there are cases, not often, where emails get bounced back by certain recipients.
 MailTips I see that this can help but I'm not familair with Exchange + Powershell, since I'm not an expert admin. Is there a GUI way of getting this to work?

It has to have no internet since it's using windows xp and it's an old pos system on 2 computers, and it would risk getting viruses. The other network is just the main computer that has connection to the internet and surveillance. Sometimes I would like to access the nas from the main computer to see how the backups are doing in the private network. Should I just connect another switch/hub from the main computer to the private network (old pos system)? Or do i need a specific type of router that aggregates/controls the ports that connects to the main computer then to the private network (old pos system)?

 The API request is pretty basic and works with curl:

 With Nornir the task looks like this:

I have tried de-prioritizing IPv6 in the registry and the netsh interface commands. I have worked with Cisco to determine we have the correct settings on the VPN. Still it doesn’t work. If I have the user run ipconfig /release, everything starts working again (for a day or two). Also, if I disable IPv6, everything works for as long as IPv6 is disabled. I have spent way too much time on this with no permanent fix other than disabling IPv6. Any thoughts on something else to try?

I am frustrated that users continue to receive $Vendor solicitations after I replied to you on September 12th. This frustration is compounded by the fact that I have had to ask other $Vendor representatives cease emailing any live body they find in our organization.

 Our site needs some switching equipment, so I ordered about 40 switches last march at the distributor. Thinking I will be in time if it takes +/- 6 months.. Well. that was 6 months ago and the current forecast (with only 80% certainty) is that it will take another 6 months.
 I already have 4x 6300 running as a core, but I need 2 more to reach my 6200F's (already running +/- 15 of those).
 I cannot afford the wait 6 months again, with the probability that they won't even be delivered. We ordered them before the prince increase, but I am getting the feeling that we will never get them, but if I order again, they will delivered sooner (but with an increase of the price ofcourse).
 ​
 Anyone in the same boat or has other switches working together? Like my 6300's are stacked (as well as some other 6200F's) and I really don't want to stack other brands/types (if that even works) but I really am in a situation that I wanted to avoid at all cost.
 Any idea's?

 I am once again asking for your IT advise oh great and mighty users of the world wide web / Reddit.
 As usual I have been tasked with something that seems impossible.
 I need to run the Registry from a non admin user but I can only run it as a user with admin rights. However giving that user admin rights only for this one time would require me to restart the server twice which in this situation is a big no no due to other issues.
 I know about the Shift + Right-Click = Run as different user. However I cannot make the changes without having admin rights. But running it as Administrator / user with admin rights, will only result in those changes applying to that user account instead.
 Basically what we need to do is create Keys and Entries for User A (non admin) which requires admin rights due to it's location. But I cannot run a .reg file to add those since you cannot run it as admin or other user. Even making changes to entries is impossible since it requires admin rights to update. Most likely to prevent normal non admin users from making changes for obvious security reasons.
 Anyone got an idea?
 For information, I need to create and modify reg keys in the following location.

 There is a problem with the default driver settings for these NICs and we need to disable a power saving feature to resolve.
 The problem is we have a number of other docks that also use Realtek NICs and we must not interfere with those NIC settings.
 Does anyone have a good script/mechanism to identify one Realtek NIC from another on the same system, in order to determine the GUID, in order to apply registry settings on just the desired NIC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always wondered if people in general feel the same way regarding Malwarebytes. I have been using it for 7 years now, paid licenses every year. Its the only AM/AV I've ever personally paid for. I love its browser guard as well. I've taken it too some seriously dirty places and it seems to relentlessly block everything.
 I personally feel its so good, despite having Cisco Secure Endpoint(which recently I found out from Morphisec themselves Cisco uses some of their mechanisms in Secure Endpoint) and Crowdstrike, just to be safe I will install MBAM and run a final check and uninstall it. Never can be too sure xD
 I am curious what are your preferred AM/AV software and if many people feel Malwarebytes is (one of)the best and if not why it may not be. I don't like being biased, if there is a reason someone may think MBAM isn't that great I'd definitely like to know why for my own preferences and knowledge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am coming from the none sysadmin side, and wondering on solutions.
 Bascially while on a Teams call I will get a disconnect from zscaler which will put my call on hold, it will then reconnect and reconnect me, this can happen depending on the length of the call 1 to 2 times.
 Our IT department is now blaming my wifi for this issue, I do not think that is the issue but have taken the steps they requested which was to restart my modem/router. 
 The setup of my home which I have explained to them a couple times now is:
 1x Netgate SG-2220 1x Omada switch (8 port PoE) 1x Omada EAP225 v3 2x Omada EAP245 v3
 On a 200/10 using FQ_Codel/Taildrop (pfsense forum recommended).
 I sit about 5 feet from one of the EAP245s, it is at 18db for 5ghz and 12db for 2.4ghz and my work computer is connecting via 5ghz, all that is between them is a small inside wall (the AP is in a closet with thin doors, no glass). Measuring on my macbook air on the same desk I see -98db noise and -44db RSSI.
 I also connect the work computer to my IoT vlan which has no access to my LAN, I redirect DNS to my pfsense box and redirect NTP to my pfsense box on all of my vlans (LAN, IoT, Guest) with no issue.
 We used to use BIG-IP and had zero issues with this software.
 EDIT: My work computer is some Dell with an i7, 16gb ram and Windows 10 Enterprise.

 All members have their daily account with some perma active assignments for common tasks and some eligible tasks that can be requested.
 Member 1 approves the requests and also is in possession of the break glass account and the "global" admin account.
 In this scenario, should member one just login to the "global" admin account when admin tasks are required, or should he also be requesting permissions and then having the "global" admin account approve the request - though that seems kind of redundant?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 We're curious how other IT professionals are managing ex-employees' mailboxes when they leave the company. The organization is experiencing rapid growth and we've found our current process isn't scalable. We use Microsoft 365, but our users have the desktop applications such as Outlook through VL. Currently, when an employee leaves the company either through termination or resignation, we add ourselves to the ex-employee's 365 account and perform a manual export of their mailbox to a PST. This PST gets saved and stored on our file server forever. Seems fairly simple when it's listed like that, but it's quite a tedious process from start to finish. You need to give yourself access to that person's mailbox, let it pull in their mail on Outlook which usually takes at least an hour if not more before it becomes accessible, (and you'd be surprised at how big we let employees' mailboxes get to), and then perform the export which again, depending on the mailbox size could just freeze your Outlook up for some time. Now ironically enough we recently found that it looks like you could do all of that in the Compliance center in 365, but we still want to look at our overall process and reassess. Do we really need to keep these employees' mailboxes forever? Does 30 days suffice and then we blow it away (with exceptions of course)? Converting to shared mailboxes seems to be a popular method - what does that look like long-term? Do you use a third-party cloud solution to archive mailboxes? 
 In short, we're just looking to explore how other businesses retain 365 mailboxes to determine our options. 
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm a little confused. I have a user that doesn't see all preferences when printing from chrome or edge. It's a domain env and we use point and print on windows 2019 server. On user's machine, In Settings > printers, when printer is installed from print server, I check printer preferences and all settings appear just like on server. But when they try to print from chrome or edge, when printing dialog pops up, I would select the printer and chose preferences, but none of the settings are there. Like stock/paper selection for example. It's like something is preventing browsers to read printer preferences. I will try again signing in as me (different domain account) and checking if issue is present but I'm pretty sure I had the user sign in on another computer and had the same issue. I will test that again. On print server though, there are no security restrictions setup.
 Any one have any idea if something in browser can affect this behavior?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you made sure your organization is ready for the deprecation of basic authentication in Exchange Online?
  
⚠️ Microsoft will begin to disable basic authentication for Exchange Online on October 1, 2022.
  
So, what will be the impacts of basic auth deprecation?
 Overall, Microsoft will disable basic authentication in Exchange Online for the following protocols:
  
Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)
 POP
 IMAP
 Remote PowerShell
 Exchange Web Services (EWS)
 Offline Address Book (OAB)
 Outlook for Windows and Mac
  
Got you screaming! Is SMTP protocol also being deprecated by Microsoft?
 No, SMTP isn't being deprecated. But if you stop using it for a while, your SMTP protocol will be disabled. Also, the SMTP will be disabled for tenants who never used the protocol previously.
 Then, what are we going to do with this deprecation?
 All we need to do is to switch to Modern authentication.
  
IMAP/POP: Now, OAuth 2.0 support for POP, IMAP, and SMTP Auth protocols have been released, so users can switch to OAuth.
 Exchange ActiveSync: If your organization still using Exchange ActiveSync, you can use Outlook Mobile clients to connect with Exchange Online.
 Do you spend more time on Remote PowerShell to access Exchange Online? Then, use Exchange Online PowerShell V2 Module which supports modern auth.
 You can begin updating your users' client applications to OAuth 2.0 versions.
 Your code must be updated to use OAuth 2.0 if you have written using protocols with Basic Authentication.
 You need to contact the developers of the 3rd party application and ask them to update it to support OAuth 2.0 or switch to an application that supports Modern authentication.
  
For more details on the basic auth deprecation and its solution, check out this article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you made sure your organization is ready for the deprecation of basic authentication in Exchange Online?
  
⚠️ Microsoft will begin to disable basic authentication for Exchange Online on October 1, 2022.
  
So, what will be the impacts of basic auth deprecation?
 Overall, Microsoft will disable basic authentication in Exchange Online for the following protocols:
  
Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)
 POP
 IMAP
 Remote PowerShell
 Exchange Web Services (EWS)
 Offline Address Book (OAB)
 Outlook for Windows and Mac
  
Got you screaming! Is SMTP protocol also being deprecated by Microsoft?
 No, SMTP isn't being deprecated. But if you stop using it for a while, your SMTP protocol will be disabled. Also, the SMTP will be disabled for tenants who never used the protocol previously.
 Then, what are we going to do with this deprecation?
 All we need to do is to switch to Modern authentication.
  
IMAP/POP: Now, OAuth 2.0 support for POP, IMAP, and SMTP Auth protocols have been released, so users can switch to OAuth.
 Exchange ActiveSync: If your organization still using Exchange ActiveSync, you can use Outlook Mobile clients to connect with Exchange Online.
 Do you spend more time on Remote PowerShell to access Exchange Online? Then, use Exchange Online PowerShell V2 Module which supports modern auth.
 You can begin updating your users' client applications to OAuth 2.0 versions.
 Your code must be updated to use OAuth 2.0 if you have written using protocols with Basic Authentication.
 You need to contact the developers of the 3rd party application and ask them to update it to support OAuth 2.0 or switch to an application that supports Modern authentication.
  
For more details on the basic auth deprecation and its solution, check out this article.

 Some Microsoft documentation suggest Complaince Policies to ensure a device is secure (jailborken, min OS, etc) can be applied to Personal Devices but I'm not sure this is right? I've applied it to all users but unlike the app protection policies these don't apply?
 Can Complaince Policies apply to Personal Devices or is it company only?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have finally gotten all users to where they are not local admins on their machines.
 We have also done a good job of having sysadmins utilize daily driver accounts as well as separate admin accounts in Active Directory.
 What I am struggling with is creating 1) 'sub-admin' accounts with rights to install software on local machines and 2) sub-admin accounts for performing basic tasks in AD and on the domain.
 Obviously you don't want to use your domain admin account to elevate a one-off software install on a local machine. And we have lots of those one-offs. We have many field technicians that require specialized mechanic's software. And they are very different per technician. You'll have one tech that is certified on Cummins, another Mercedes etc. There's really no way to standardize things. So they must call in for assistance with installation.
 One of my colleagues has piloted an installers security group in AD and gave that group local admin rights on all workstations. 
 Several problems with this:
 1) you now have (in our case) half a dozen or more new accounts with the power to wipe out every single workstation. 
 2) it does not solve the problem of machines not being on the corporate network bc you can't elevate with no DC available. VPN on every machine with another 2FA account and PW ?
 3) are we to create yet ANOTHER tier of admin accounts to, for example, run RSAT ADUC?
 The more I read, the more I get spooked to EVER use a domain admin account. But it's also almost like a custom account needs to be created for every single task. DNS change? use your DNS admin account. DHCP change? DHCP login. Add a subnet to sites and services? GPO change? SAS account. GPO account. WTF? Is this the state of the world now ?
 I am all ears for reasonable suggestions.

 Basically client has two separate networks running in adjacent locations. Lets say network 1 and network 1 . He needs to connect both networks such that any data when it leaves Network 1 gets encrypted by an appliance and then the encrypted data travels through the data pipe and when it enters network 2 gets decrypted by another appliance and the data enters network 2 as decrypted data and vice versa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined my current company in February this year, the CIO who brought me had also just started few months earlier than me, previously everyone had local admin rights, the IT infrastructure and AD was a total chaos, the CIO been implementing a lot of changes and as you'd expect, some people aren't happy about it, especially the guys from Technical services. We installed the AdminByRequest where they can request admin rights for a period of about 30miinutes. Well the war has been ongoing since then with lots of complaints. Just got an e-mail that someone tried installing a Siemans app that requires more than 30 minutes to install so half way through the installation, the process stops since the AdminByRequest is only valid for 30minutes.
 ​
 i stand to be corrected, but is admin right only needed to start the installation process? or is it required for the entire period of the installation?
 Also is there a better way to handle this? since they are insisting on having their local admin rights? how do you deal with this in your organization?
 Thanks for your time.

 So... why not find out:
 ADHD screening questionnaire
 Autism screening questionnaire
 Don't look at them as 'horror stories' - chances are if you're gainfully employed, you're not a particularly severe case.
 However it may help you understand how your brain works, and how it's not like "Normal" people. And you can make adaptations and coping strategies. 
 I genuinely feel that both these traits can be extremely beneficial in a sysadmin, if they're harnessed effectively. Maybe you don't even need medication for it - just a better understanding of what things you do well, and why you find the hard things hard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I configured HTTPS Listener for WinRM with a self-signed certificate, I followed this tutorial :
 http://vcloud-lab.com/entries/powershell/powershell-remoting-over-https-using-self-signed-ssl-certificate
 It works. I can connect Powershell remotly from any device on my network, even if I don't add the self-signed certificate in the CA Trust Store thanks to options -SkipCACheck and -SkipCNCheck. I can connect with the IP address.
 But after sysprep of the server, the HTTPS listener is preserved and listens on port 5986, the self-signed cert is still in the Local Store but the remote connection doesn't work !
 ​
 I get this when I try to connect to the server (syspreped) :
 Connecting to remote server 10.X.X.X failed with the following error message : The server certificate on the destination computer (10.X.X.X:5986) has the following errors: Encountered an internal error in the SSL library 
 I can't connect with both IP address and DNS name (that matches the previous certificate)
 On the remote server, when I check winRM config, I get this message :
 Error number: -2144108267 0x80338115 Cannot create a WinRM listener on HTTPS because this machine does not have an appropriate certificate. To be used for SSL, a certificate must have a CN matching the hostname, be appropriate for Server Authentication, and not be expired, revoked, or self-signed. 
 Before the sysprep, winRM HTTPS was working. After sysprep, it doesn't work anymore.
 What happens during sysprep process ? What does change with the certificate ? Do I need to use an other process to configure winRM ?
 ​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes yes I know, another STP question. I was handed a new Aruba CX 6000 switch from my boss to play around with, and learn the new config. I've watched the airheads youtube series about AOS-CX which was very helpful, and I have been scrolling through the 1900 page manual, but I am not sure if I got it right. 
 I am trying to use MSTP, have my client access ports configured as admin-edge with bpdu-guard and loop-guard enabled. In my example config the first 10 ports are configured for wireless access points, the next 10 for clients, and the last 4 are for links to other switches, and to the firewall. 
 When I connect an older 2530 switch to port 1/1/24 I'm getting STP issues and the 2530 disables the port. 
 I do not have a config to compare mine to, or anyone at all to ask. Did I get this right or did I make some rookie mistakes? The VLANs are not the issue, I'm not completely new to networking, its just the MSTP that I'm struggling to understand. 
 According to what I learned I should not have to enable bpdu or loop guard on the uplinks, but only on client access ports? Does this include APs? 
 ​
 Any videos/info about MSTP in AOS-CX would be very helpful.

 My preference goes to putting up a display (Joan or Evoko) at each meeting room - but for multiple reasons we aren't allowed to do that. :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We will be migrating emails for a specific domain in the coming days and I was wondering whether anyone had done this before with Mimecast. I raised a Support Request with Mimecast over a week ago and have had no response at all, which is rubbish.
 So domain.com is currently in 365 TenantA with MX pointing directly to Microsoft and we will be bringing this domain into our 365 TenantB. We use Mimecast for our email security, so this domain will be added here too. My previous plan for these types of migrations has been:
 1) Change MX of domain.com to something invalid. Emails will queue and retry at sender for an unknown period. 2) Add domain to 365 and add aliases. 3) Add domain to Mimecast and perform directory sync from 365 so Mimecast is aware of all the new aliases. 4) Change MX to Mimecast.
 This works well, with the exception of the unknown behaviour when switching to the bogus MX records.
 It got me wondering; is there a way with Mimecast that we could bring the domain in earlier, maybe even pre-migration, so that when I start the rip out of the domain from TenantA, Mimecast will queue email and then ultimately deliver when all the aliases are added to TenantB? Is that or something similar possible?
 Thanks in advance!

 I trie to find a client VPN IPSec compatibles Windows / MacOS / Linux with IKv2 and AES-GCM encryption support for a Fortigate Gateway VPN.
 FortiClient doesn't support IKev2. I already try TheGreenBow VPN Clients but i have performance problem on MacOS.
 If you have any advice for an other client i will be glad to heard them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 More and more of our clients are starting to use server 2019 on their rds farm. Eventually they're all confronted with slow session openings.
 Firewall rules are clean, we use a script to clean them every weekend or months. PS command "get-netfirewall rule | measure" only returns about 1k rules max.
 I've read alot about the appreadiness service causing problems like this and when the service is disabled, sessions open nearly instantly. I've also read about problems with updates when the service is disabled.
 Are you guys dealing with the same issue and is there any other way to deal with it ?

On the switch I have a vlan 1 with an IP address and from the switch I can ping the management IP and the diagnostic interface IP on the FTD. So far, so good.
 From the FTD to the switch I cannot reach anything.
 I cannot ping the vlan 1 IP address on the switch, even though I do get an ARP entry in the table, and the ping returns question marks, not dots. I had configured an IP address on the diagnostic interface in order to be able to reach a local DNS server from the FTD so I can use FQDN objects in some rules.
 I have checked ten locations and five of them work as expected (ping and DNS resolution) and five of them cannot reach the local IP addresses on the switch or DNS servers. 
 This makes me feel like a noob. How can it be that I can ping from the switch to the FTD but not the other way round?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 ​
 I am trying to set up a backup NTP server for remote client PCs which have joined domain when they are disconnected from corporate network.
 ​
 I followed this blog post particularly "Enable Backup Simple-NTP Sync" part to have a backup NTP server for remote client PCs.
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/domain-time-synchronization-in-the-age-of-working-from-home/ba-p/1440820
 ​
 After adding those reg keys I captured NTP traffic with wireshark but I only see NTP traffic between client and external NTP server even the client is connected to corporate network via VPN.
 interesting thing is that when I run w32tm /query /status command, it shows the source time server as my domain controller though I did not see that traffic on wireshark.
 ​
 My understanding for these configuration is that the client will first try to sync time to domain controller and if domain controller is unreachable then will try sync time to external NTP server.
 At the moment the client PC does not even try to talk to domain controller by looking at captured packets.
 ​
 Does anyone have the same issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 is there a standard or best practice as to whether DHCP reservations should be set inside or outside the address pool?
 Simple example: DHCP Pool = 192.168.0.50 - 192.168.0.149/24
 The client should now get a "fixed" IP in form of a reservation. But which? 192.168.0.50 or 192.168.0.150?
 I have read different recommendations so far, from definitely inside, definitely outside to never mind.
 Sometimes I stumble over devices that don't even allow a reservation outside the pool.
 That's also why I've always defined reservations within the scope and only really fixed IPs outside of it.
 On the other hand, the pfSense Docs says:
  
ISC dhcpd only checks via ping to ensure that an IP is not actively in use when making assignments.Making a static mapping does not “reserve” that IP out of the pool.The static mapping in this case merely represents a preference for an IP and others are not prevented from taking the IP if it is not in use. 
 (...) 
 As such, it is best to only make assignments outside the range/pool, and the GUI enforces this practice.
  
So how it the right way to do it?
 Thanks and greetings,
 Martin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to create a PBR with multiple next hops but have them verified by different track objects. In IOS there is a parameter to use a sequence number to order the next hop list. I could define multiple next hop addresses in different set statements each with their own track object like below:
 IOS-Router(config-route-map)#set ip next-hop verify-availability 1.1.1.1 ?
 <1-65535> Sequence to insert into next-hop list
 ​
 In NX-OS 9.3.3 this feature does not seem to exist. I can only configure a single next hop if I use the verify-availability parameter and no sequence number available. I ran across an ePBR feature introduced in 9.3.5 but wasn't sure if this was the future of PBR on nexus or something different. Has any one come across this and found a workaround?

We mostly use these public ips for remote access and various public to private and private to public nat translations. Recently we have just used our last available public IP however I have just received a request to create another public to private static nat translation so that our internal smtp mail server can be accessible externally. My question is, if I request another /28 from our datacenter to use to complete this request , would I be able to configure a new public to private static nat using one if these new ips even though my firewall does not have a interface in this new subnet?

 My question is when did they change the name, and how much less expensive would it be of they still called it a VPN?

I am able to authenticate with SNMPv2 with a community string, but I would like to use SNMPv3. They seem to authenticate sometimes, but other times it with just keep trying and trying with no authentication. 
 My questions are, does every device have to have a unique engine-id? If so, is there a way to automate which one the switch chooses or do I have to manually enter each one to be unique? In addition, does anyone know of any limitation on what passwords the switch will accept for the sha and des? Perhaps my actual passwords are using forbidden characters?
 Below is an example used (with usernames and passwords substituted):
 snmp-server engine local 800002980300000000000001

 Okay so, most of you are probably thinking: Pride in IT support???
 But hear me out...
 I recently started a job as a 1st line IT support employee. I was really proud of myself when I got this job, because for me, it was a way to get into IT. It also happend to pay well.
 The way I looked at my job, was like this: An entry level IT job that I can grow in and use as an foundation to hopefully grow into something else.
 I never looked at it like it's a low job (in a negative way), even tho it's on the bottom of the pyramid.
 The thing is that I sometimes get negative comments that put me down and make me lose the motivation and pride in what I do, or the grow process that I'm in.
 Some of the negative comments or actions that I experience: "Just let him do the shitty work, he's a first line employee." "You're not on our level yet, our work is way more difficult."
 Just comments that show that I'm on the lowest level of IT.
 I know it's not the most prestigious job, but is it really that bad and shameful?
 Ps: I don't hate what I do. It's a boring job, but it pays well and it's comfortable.

 We are using vpc on our switches and rstp for spanning tree.
 Typical 3 tier Cisco architecture.
 Only has 1 svi for switch management and a bunch of vlans.
 Default gateway pointed to svi on core switch.
 Has ACLS, snmp, qos, aaa and ntp configurations as well.
 Access switches have uplinks to distribution switches using port channels.
 Distribution switches have uplinks to core using port channels.
 Will be replacing them with 9k Nexus switches which will have the same configuration as the old ones (apart from the svi which will temporarily have a different IP).
 Plan is to connect the access switches to the old distribution as well as the new distribution switches so that end devices/access switches can reach the core switches 2 ways, 1 through old distribution pair and the other through new distribution pair. Therefore all we have to do is turn off old ports on old pair during the change window and we should expect traffic to flow through new pair?
 Is this the right way?
 And we want this to be done with no downtime.
 Thank you.

 Title says it all really, file is located in Users/User/Pictures/photolibrary.photolibrary/resources/derivatives/thumbs, can't find this location, either it's hidden or perhaps part of the photos.db? Either way we need to either move, delete, or rename this file but as it stands I can't find any way to interact with it. Could the db be corrupted?
 NGL all I can do is speculate as I really know nothing about OSX. When I say nothing I really mean nothing, my experience with Macs is about enough to get angry when trying to right-click.

 One of the issues we've run into is that scheduled tasks with stored credentials don't seem to work after disabling NTLM. We definitely need jobs to run as domain users, rather than SYSTEM. For those of you who have managed to wipe out NTLM, how have you dealt with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Specifically this has to do with end user machines. At multiple different doctors offices (some run by large hospital chains) I see more computers just left unlocked with lots of personal information on them and unattended. In hospitals the same problem exists and the only type of security seems to be “well it auto locks after 10, 15, or more minutes” even at one hospital where you have to scan a badge to unlock the computer on the screen it has a countdown timer to auto lock after 20 minutes. 
 At a recent ER trip they left the room every time without logging out and the dashboard up basically told me about everybody’s current issues, name, DOB, etc. including myself
 I understand that IT and sys admins only have so much power in the medical world and doctors will complain if a computer locks but there has to be a happy medium?
 I understand that critical medical equipment can not go to sleep or lock but the end user machines entering data should have better policies

 i have a new question for you. Since now finally OneDrive is working with the GPO"s 
 I am wondering if this is possible as well. 
 ​
 Since OneDrive gpoeditor provides only to backup desktop/pictures/documents. I was wondering if there is an GPO available from Firefox or Chrome in the admx files where i can store the bookmarks for example on documents, or desktop etc.
 ​
 I downloaded https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwindows
 i downloaded https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases

 and did the following: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xpc45u/comment/iq3auit/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 
 So it works, when i want to add the admx and adml files, now i see it.

Thinking about bringing on an MSP as a backup for times when I'm on vacation, or in the hospital, etc...
 Curious to hear tips from anyone that has been thru a similar scenario. If they are to be a true backup rather than a simple help desk in my absence that would require giving them access and documentation to *everything*, not to mention wondering how they would handle all the specialty software that comes with the industry, keeping them up to date with changes, etc... Just wondering the best way to go about that, or if we shouldn't even try and just get them to cover 80-90% of the basics?

 The server was shutdown at the time and came back online just fine. The data volume is operating fine and nothing seems out of place from a user experience perspective. That's the good news, nothing bad has happened yet..
 However, what are my options now? The OS does not see the newly allocated disk space if relevant.
 The main VHDX is 13.5 TB (this is the one I expanded), the AVHDX is 419 GB, and there is 829 GB free on the drive that contains them both so there should be enough space to merge them.
 My primary concern is merging them with now mismatching disk sizes between the VHDX and AVHDX. Can I shrink my expansion back down to the previous size and then delete the checkpoint to complete the merge?
 We do have VEEAM backups both onsite and in the cloud, but obviously 13.5 TB is a doozy even over the LAN.
 The checkpoint is from 9/20, the expansion was on 9/24, and the time of this posting is 9/27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we are going through a network upgrade which includes all new devices, new ISP circuit, new servers, new fiber, etc. One thing that is new and we haven't dealt with before is implementing SPLUNK. SPLUNK will be used to log everything from clients, servers, network devices, and whatever else. It is currently setup and running, but not currently collecting anything from out network devices. 
 For our syslog, we currently use Solar Winds Kiwi Syslog and that collects the data from all of our devices. My understanding with SPLUNK is that we set up a forwarder and the forwarder takes all the logs the Kiwi collects and forwards them to SPLUNK.
 Our department director is tired or waiting on the contractors to figure things out, so we he wants us to start configuring SPLUNK. He stated that he thinks SPLUNK has modules or packages you can setup that are made for Cisco devices which should make it easy to setup.
 What is the best way to go about setting this up? Is using a forwarder the right way to go about doing this? And if that's the case, do I still need to setup some type of module on SPLUNK for cisco devices? Or do I just forward the logs and analyze them that way? I was told to figure out what devices I need data collected from, but we already have kiwi collecting logs from all devices, so was thinking that those logs could just be forwarded as a whole. I didn't think I would have to install modules for each device that I want to collect date from. 
 I have zero experience with splunk, so just looking to get pointed in the right direction.
 Thanks.

 Do these machines newer machines come with operations manuals or something other than the "help" pages from the command line? I've been un-lucky in my search for documentation on these machines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy,
 I'm helping a small business who is redesigning their network from scratch. I'm looking for some recommendations on how to segment the network and also recommendations on securing the Guest network.
 We are going with Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment. When everything is all said and done we will have:
  
UDM/router
 POE Switch
 4 WAPs
 6 (or so) outside security cameras
 1 badge reader for door access
 1 video doorbell
 6 smart TVs
 I think that's it but will update if I think of anything else
  
The couple computers that are used only need internet access. There will not be a file server or the need to share files. All that is done through OneDrive/Teams which just needs internet.
 ​
 What recommendations would anyone have for different networks to have? I was envisioning possibly 3 networks:
  
Main Network
 Guest Network
 IOT Network (not sure if we need this one)
  
The Main Network would be for all the stuff in the list about except the TVs.
 The Guest Network could be for the handful of computers they have. These could also go on the Main Network but I don't think there's any real need for that. Could go either way on this one. Smart devices could go here.
 The IOT Network could be for the TVs and any other "smart" devices that might get added down the road. Again, not sure if this is actually needed as these could just go on the Guest Network.
 ​
 The other question is, How would you recommend we secure the Guest Network?
  
Wide Open - Company Computers would then go on the Main Network
 WPA Key - Post a key on a sign, people can connect to it just like any other network. Smart devices could go on this network
 Wide Open w/ Terms & Condition - Need to click "I Agree" like at a hotel - This is annoying at times and some equipment doesn't handle that sort of interface very well. Smart devices would probably need an IOT network then.
  
​
 Thanks for any input and ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expanded Data Volume with Checkpoints - Options?
 I was an idiot and expanded my data drive (does not contain the OS) on a VM that had checkpoints in place from a few days prior.
 The server was shutdown at the time and came back online just fine. The data volume is operating fine and nothing seems out of place from a user experience perspective. That's the good news, nothing bad has happened yet..
 However, what are my options now? The OS does not see the newly allocated disk space if relevant.
 The main VHDX is 13.5 TB (this is the one I expanded), the AVHDX is 419 GB, and there is 829 GB free on the drive that contains them both so there should be enough space to merge them.
 We do have VEEAM backups both onsite and in the cloud, but obviously 13.5 TB is a doozy even over the LAN.
 The checkpoint is from 9/20, the expansion was on 9/24, and the time of this posting is 9/27.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have any experience with this? Client was sold a new printer by Canon without talking to us and they were told nothing would change. They were using ULM which integrates to their AD. It appears that ULM is no longer supported and Canon told the client they will need to use Uniflow Online Express which I believe is the free tier of Uniflow. 
 I'm really struggling to find anything on the Canon site about the technical details, it's mostly just sales stuff. From my understanding so far it won't link with AD, that would be the paid for uniflow version which would also need the paid for Universal Print by Microsoft (which uses Azure AD rather then AD). 
 I think the bit I'm hazy on is how it all connects. Does the Uniflow driver connect to something in the cloud that connects to the printer?
 Going forwards it's not essential that it integrates with AD, it's a small school with 60 - 70 staff, so I could set them individually and add it to the new user process, but I curious as to peoples experiances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title says it all: is it possible to delay e-mails that get sent to an external recipient with a slight delay?
 We're using a third-party tool to attach our internal and external mail signatures. The tool also attaches the signature to the mail within the senders' outbox, but it uses the signature of the last email sent.
 That's our Problem. For legal reasons, we need to always attach the external signature within the senders' outbox.
 As the tool doesn't provide this feature, it would be helpful to delay the mail to the external recipient for a few seconds, so the signature would be our external signature. 
 ​
 Is this possible with exchange online, or is there a better solution?

 I'm currently doing an apprenticeship as a sysadmin in Switzerland and I'm wondering if you guys could tell me what useful certificates I could get to start in this business. I feel like I don't get enough training in my apprenticeship that's why I want to get some certificates so I'll have a better chance of finding a good job after my apprenticeship.
 Some certificates that are currently on my mind are MS-700 Teams Administrator Associate, AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate, and the Cisco CCNA. What are your thoughts?

 Thanks for any help.

Without these certs some sites don’t load because of not being able to establish a https connection. I have pritunl vpn in a vm on a server and it accessible through port 17905 which i don’t think is a standard port if i use obfuscation would the vpn work and get past the firewall or because i don’t have the ssl cert downloaded would that stop me connecting. Does anyone have an idea of what part either the ssl cert or dpi is blocking i also noted that you can’t seem to connect to IP’s directly as in i couldn’t connect to the vpns webpage even though i port forwarded it though i could connect to websites that i reverse looked up to find there ip The vpn works when on any other network including 4g(on iPhone) Is this just a easy case to finding a vpn that supports obfuscation to bypass the dpi?

 I was at a conference the other day and saw that Cisco DNAC can adopt and provision brand new switches / routers without needing telnet/ssh first.
 From what I understand they are using DHCP Option 43 to point devices to DNAC but also mentioned using the g0/0/0 OOB port. Is this possible with Ansible? I would hate to have to login to XXX brand devices just to get Ansible reach ability for configuration.
 Im also open to any other product if you all have any ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the "recent" rulings from more and more data protection authorities regarding the legality of using Google analytics as a European company - it has finally become a priority for us to get a proper overview. 
 Our "known" offenders have been working on this for a while preparing pseudonymization or moving away from GA, but as we have 400+ domains each with the option of subdomains I'm sure we have more around which have come in over the years from M&As or simply rogue employees. 
 As we have a pretty good overview of the domains I'm looking for a simple way to scan a list of hostnames and produce a GA "Yes/no" result. 
 I considered just doing an invoke-webrequest and checking for references to GA .js files such as 
  
Google Analytics (ga.js)
 Google Analytics Remarketing (dc.js)
 Google Universal Analytics (analytics.js)
 Google Analytics Global Site Tag (gtag.js)
 Google Analytics Experiments (ga_exp.js)
 Google Tag Manager (gtm.js)
 Google AdWords Conversion (conversion.js)
 Google AdWords Phone Conversion (loader.js)
 Google AdWords Remarketing (conversion.js)
 Google AdWords Dynamic Remarketing (conversion.js)
  
I'm not really sure if that would produce valid results 
 surely someone else has already come across this, or produced a script which my google-fu is just not able to dig out 
 I've looked at sites such as builtwith.com or gachecker.com - but can't run through 1000s of hostnames by hand

 The Onedrive client will either hang at "processing changes..." of "We are trying to sign you in" 
 We also see that the client removes synced folders from explorer, and when we try to sync them it prompts a message saying "We found this folder, would you like to use this" 
 More and more users are having general issues with Onedrive, are you guys seeing something similar?

 We were currently evaluating some email security solutions.
 We evaluated Proofpoint Security Essentials and Anubis Networks.
 Both are very good, however, meanwhile we also acquired Office 365 E5 licenses for all users, and thus, we were able to test Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
 So I'm asking your opinion, if I should spend money on Proofpoint (therefore having 2 products Proofpoint SE + Defender) or if Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will be enough to stop those pesky emails (spam, phishing, malware).
 Thank you for your opinions.

 While doing so migrating for the datacenters i had no issues at all , but while migrating for the braches i faced a little issue with the Vlan creation on the Cisco Vmanage.
 as i do usally i first check the router configuration that is currently deployed on the site and then create template on the cisco vmanage for the sd-wan router thats going to replace it, while all the brached on the customer side are router on stick which means all the vlans are created on the router it self and there is no core switch or any kind of L3 switch on the braches.
 The only issue that i am facing is that the customer has total of 94 different vlans on each branch , so the questions is do i create 94 different vlan template and push it ? , which i already did and was stuck at about 30 and i cannot put any more on VPN 1 (service side vpn) , or is this another way or solution that i am not awre about ? 
 appreciate any help or advice

 Cue digging around in the calendar permissions and delegates to see how this could have happened but no where did User A have any such permission.
 Eventually we found that they were in a group that had been given full access to User B's mailbox, however previously this has never been an issue and the permissions have been in place for quite some time. As a test, we removed the group from Full Access and half an hour later, User A couldn't see private items anymore.
 I can't find anything online (feel free to perform better Google-fu) that suggests that MS have made this change and our mailboxes were migrated to EO a few years ago and there haven't been any recent changes that we've made. Has anyone else encountered this recently?

 Let me try and explain, as I am a total newbie, when it comes to certs:
 My client has MailStore installed on-premise and the add-in activated for his outlook installation. When opening Outlook, with the add-in, a cert warning pops up, asking, if I trust this website/ connection. When I look at the cert, I see "TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT" as the issuer. Now, I've looked up the name, and it seems to be a trustworthy service of some sort, but again, it has nothing to do with our MailStore …]]></summary>

 I’ve recently got a new job at a company to migrate from their current MSP to lead the in house IT department, and eventually phase them out.
 We have been back and forth with them and they have let us know that they can’t provide any access to anything before signing an indemnity clause (which is fair enough).
 We are sorting out the new agreement where they are asking which services to drop for now and to change to a block hour rate service instead.
 They run RMM software as usual, and are asking if we want to adopt it with a fee. Are there any better solutions for a small business instead of RMM? Monitoring/Management more tailored for in-house IT?
 Any other advice from people who have maybe dealt with this situation before will be appreciated as well.
 Apologies if not enough detail, first time posting.

 I have been working as a system administrator for the last 12 yrs.(mostly onprem infra and Azure for AD). I have recently passed AWS SAA C02, CKA. I have gone thru some courses on Ansible, jenkins, Terraform, Python to understand all the moving pieces in the world of DevOps. I have done some small projects at my home lab to get an understanding of these technologies. 
 I have started looking at the job market this month and started noticing very few postings. (I am based in Canada, looking for opportunities in US and Canada). 
 I spoke to few of my friends and colleagues who are in the industry and i have got mixed opinions. Some say, DevOps job roles won't be affected even if we end up in a recession. Some say, just stick to my current job (stable job) until the dust settles. 
 I m really confused of what to do. Should i wait until early next year or should I continue with my job search. 
 Please advise.

 If my question is surprisingly simple for you, it is because my background is not in telecommunication. I'm a machine learning engineer. But for a project, I need to understand the environment very well.
 I'm learning about the handover and resource allocation in telecommunication. The handover is not the main part actually. But because transferring devices get triggered by devices' measurement reports, I need to understand it in the context of 5G.
 The problem is 3GPP standards and ETSI are generic and don't talk about what happens in devices exactly. Online websites that talk about it contradict each other.
 So I'm wondering if someone can point me to a document that explains exactly what happens in a mobile device before sending those measurement reports.
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I manage a 40G ring network with around 10 locations. Each location has around 20 routes. Each site is using a Juniper EX4300 pair connected to an OSPF ring. Our DC sits on the ring and aggregates all routes with a pair of EX4600s. Our firewall then does peering and WAN. 
 We are in the process of migrating from a ring topology to a star topology in a new colocation space. I am looking for advice on hardware. Each location will be connected to the DC w/ 2 x 10G fiber strands and 1G WISP backup. 
 I am thinking of dropping 2 x MX150s at each location, and then using an ACX 7024 pair at the DC, but is this overkill? Should I just upgrade to a better L3 switch setup? Looking for recommendations. I love Juniper but am open to other options. I am pretty familiar w/ Cisco IOS and other similar platforms. We are somewhat budget oriented, but I am trying to stay away from Mikrotik. (We are required to have support contracts)
 I have never working with the MX or ACX series before. I was considering the MX204, but with the EoL announcement, it is out of the question. We are looking to purchase hardware early next year, and it will probably be another year after that until the project is complete. Thank you

 On the web the commonly suggested method seems to be to add the share in Login Items.
 This works initially but as it just fires at login and doesn't keep alive through disruptions, the user will have to reconnect manually through Finder again should the connection drop.
 Were I on Linux I would just use fstab, but I'm seeing some conflicting information on this for MacOS and Samba network shares.
 It varies from using similar files in the form of "/etc/auto_master", "/etc/auto_smb", "synthetic.conf", and then of course "/etc/fstab" itself (which itself has further different suggestions to use "cifs" in the filesystem type column, or "-fstype=smbfs" in the options column).
 What is the best, and most "correct" approach as of Monterrey, which will ensure if the connection drops, the mount will work again upon reconnection?
  
Hacky (albeit working) solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to get some people's opinions on an affordable but robust way to connect new cabins (sleeps 12 in bunks) at a summer camp. Because it will be new construction we'll have more options in terms of cable runs and infrastructure. As we are a nonprofit, cost is always a concern and has to be balanced with performance. We currently use mostly Ubiquiti gear for better or for worse and have 500mb fiber coming in with internal fiber to most developed "areas" of our 1000 acre campus.
 My initial thought was running fiber from one of our main hubs to the central bath house, where a fiber switch would feed fiber directly to each of the cabins. In the cabins' attic would be a media converter and access point. I'm thinking I'd like to get some ethernet drops run into convenient places and have the ability to upgrade to a fiber switch if more connections become a need late on.
 Thoughts or suggestions?

 I've been working almost exclusively with Cisco wireless over last few years (some Meraki thrown in for good measure). This includes ekahau surveys, deployment, troubleshooting a range of AirOS and the new Catalyst WLCs, across hundreds of deployments at this stage. 
 I have an upcoming opportunity to start working with Aruba wireless side of things (due to costs, lead times in some areas, general boredom, proof of concept), which I have not touched in years. Generally I would say a wireless protocol is a wireless protocol, regardless of vendor - However, based on your experiences, is there any glaring differences or "gotchas" when it comes to switching from deploying cisco 5508/5520/9800s to the Aruba equivalents? I would love to hear some personal experiences from others making a similar switch, and how that went.

Our primary server room shares a wall with the raw materials warehouse. Don't ask, we're working on changing this.
 ​
 This morning I go into the server room to get a serial number off a device, and I notice a puddle of water on the floor. Fortunately all servers are in racks and are lifted well off the floor, so no equipment is in immediate danger. We immediately call facilities to come and take a look and while we wait, we trace the water to a leak in the drain leading from one of the air conditioners. Now while this was cracked, it shouldn't be leaking this much, as it drains outside of the room.

 We have been working with them for 1.5 years now. In the last few months some issues have come up regarding their adherence to SLAs. Plus we are currently negotiating new server equipment (they are one possible vendor amongst others).

It's pretty annoying, and I often need to get in there and refute something, or point out how it doesn't apply to our situation.
 I'm talking about people tagging IT and saying that we need to turn off windows updates ASAP, with a link to an article titled "Microsoft confirms it's intentionally bricking 3rd party laptops" (I'm paraphrasing the title) . The actual article is wildly misleading, and appears to be a reference to a problem with a windows update that happened several years ago.
 Also got a "Looks like we can stop using MFA?" comment in reference to an article with a title like "MFA does nothing!". This one was native marketing for a privacy VPN product. The argument was basically that MFA doesn't stop your employer from monitoring your web traffic, technically correct, but misses the whole point of MFA.
 Do you guys have a ready response when people post stuff like this? If it's a security vulnerability thing, I see if there is a CVE reference, if it's an MS thing, a KB. with those it's possible to actually check if this is a real thing we have to care about, but it basically never is.

 I'm looking for some clever ideas for some kind of "Thank You" gift for people inside my company who are NOT IT personnel but they go above and beyond to help out with our IT department. These people are typically in our remote offices where we have no IT support and do some of the standard "move patch cable from #x to #xx," "connect computer to internet so I can remote in," "reboot kiosk computer when frozen," etc.
 I've always thought it'd be cool to have a common gift that they can proudly display on their desk or bookshelf that shows my appreciate for them beyond the constant "Thanks YOUs" I send them via phone, email, Teams, etc. 
 Do any of you have any ideas for this type of gift? I was thinking something simple like a coffee mug or desk ornament or something along those lines. It doesn't have to be 'dirt cheap,' but I'd like to be able to afford quite a few of them and send them out then someone goes above and beyond to help out.

 Sorry if this question has been asked before but I simply can't find a clear answer anywhere.
 I work for a small firm as a developer, but since I'm the only IT'er I'm also the one who manages their office 365, even though I'm far from an expert.
 Currently I've been aware for a while now that basic authentication will be disabled and I've taken precautions so that external applications won't use this method any more.
 Just to be sure, I've enforced MFA for all the key users (but not everyone because they don't want the hassle)
 But now I'm seeing the following message in Azure:
 "Starting Sept. 30th, 2022 Combined registration experiences for MFA and SSPR will be enabled for all tenants"
 I checked and currently SSPR is disabled.
 I've been looking around and can't find a clear answer on what exactly will happen after sept. 30 for the end user.
 Will everyone have to run through the process of MFA and SSPR after oct. 1??
 In the sense that they will be logged out, and have to set up an additional authentication method?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am in the process of configuring Cisco Umbrella DNS filtering and I noticed that, whilst it wasn't working particularly well on Chrome (only blocking the first request and allowing subsequent requests straight through), it was working perfectly on Firefox.
 After doing some digging, it appears that when Chrome detects the DNS servers in use support DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), it will automatically, unless specified by an admin policy, switch to using Secure DNS.
 With Secure DNS being served over HTTPS, this traffic no longer arrives at Umbrella on port 53 and appears to bypass DNS inspection completely.
 I have a case open with Cisco Umbrella on this one, but has anyone else come across this? Surely they haven't enabled DoH on their DNS servers and created a bypass for their own product?
 Edit: disabling Secure DNS via Group Policy for corporate users is definitely a possibility. I will have them routing via the (Secure Web Gateway) SWG so it would likely get caught there. I have intention of securing Guest WiFi users of which I have no control over their devices/browsers. This is my main concern.
 Thanks in advance

 However 6 weeks ago the VPS I use switched IP addresses, and suddenly Google started outright blocking my emails with the following message: 
 Our system has detected that 550-5.7.1 this message is likely suspicious due to the very low reputation of 550-5.7.1 the sending domain. To best protect our users from spam, the message 550-5.7.1 has been blocked. Please visit 550 5.7.1 https://support.google.com/mail/answer/188131 for more information. 
 I have checked all my mail logs, and there is no evidence of the domain being abused, and personally I do not send out any spam. I have since tried to fill out the Google from to have the domain unbanned twice, with no apparent results.
 My domain or IP is not listed on any blacklists, so I'm completely out of ideas...
 Google Postmaster reports both the domain and IP as having a "bad" reputation 2 days before I obtained the new IP address, so maybe the IP belonged to a spammer before?
 Does anyone know what I could try next?

 Not wanting to remove any email as the mailbox is used for search function for every task.
 Brainstorming the best solution here. Seems moving older email to a backup external drive PST outlook file would be best and if they ever want to look at this then just have the external drive plugged in always on the laptop when opening Outlook thus still having all these emails and not reaching the 100GB limit by O365 standards?
 Curious to know what others have done in this situation when the 100GB is reached and Microsoft not really having a solution past the 100GB. *Making internal standard to just tell users such as this to remove emails and not use mailbox as search for several years in the past is not really an option as easy as that could be...

 Just looking for some advice,
 I’ve noriced a lot of my servers are reporting group policy errors under the system log stating ‘The processing of group policy failed internal system error’ and to check the operational log. I’ve checked this log and can’t see any errors? 
 I’ve filtered the event ID 1125 on one particular server and it’s very random. One day it happened 4 times, another day twice and some days not at all. I’m really stumped, nothing appears broken on the GPO front, the furthest the error ID 1125 goes back is Jan 2022. Looking back through them again it’s very random when the error is logged. 
 Just curious if anyone else has these event IDs regularly in their environment 
 Thank you

 Currently we are blocking all outbound traffic to a country on the FW but occasionally a DNS request for a service will resolve to server there. We'd like only responses to be from other servers in the region even tho country X might be closest.

When the ACL is set, I cannot access the internet, but can resolve names, I have not got a proxy set. Am I missing something? Am I right in thinking that after 30 permit there is essentially a 'block everything' not already defined style rule?
 ip access-list extended "BYOD" 10 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 67 20 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 68 30 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 53 exit 
 From the examples I have seen online, I don't have to add the gateway address or anything? Or should I be naming specific address ranges that the client shouldn't be able to access and then setting a permit ip any any underneath 30 permit udp....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in the past few years I have been constantly dealing with super bad quality video courses of software companies in order to get their "tEcHnIcAl CeRtiFiCaTion".
 Most of them were some sort of backup service, antimalware crap, pentesting stuff like acunetix, you get the idea.
 The other day for example, I had to do a certificate for an anti malware client like kasperski or norton and the company left in multiple retakes of lines he had to do.
 He either had to cough or didn't get the pronunciation right and went: "aw damn, gotta do the line again - OK! - bla bla" and went on with the rest of the script.
 I just don't get why you would make them so unprofessionally.
 Now I do get that people can be overworked and struggle to get the video out in time, because this might not even be their actual job.
 The company probably had to get the video out in time, but come on man, this is just such a pain to watch and retrieve information from.
 Also what's up with non native english speakers putting out english tutorials in shitty english?
 We're talking about companies that make literally dozens of millions of buckeroos per year in profit.
 It's just so damn of putting. 
 Some sentences sound like questions, but are not questions
 Some sentences are grammatically incorrect
 Some sentences are being mumbled
 Some words are used in the wrong way 
 And don't get me started on flashy graphics in the video that don't have to do anything with the product itself and the cheesy, soft gitarre music in the background.
 Do you get what I mean? 
 I'm probably just fed up with having to do these wannabe technical certifications, so that our company get's better pricing for said product, but damn... 
 I think I need to look for another job.

 This problem occurs when connecting from the RDWeb site.
 If I do a direct connection from the RD Client it is working. 
 All my clients are on remote networks connected by VPN so the RDS severs and the clients are on different subnets. 
 DNS lookups is OK, for example I can ping all addresses both by server name and fqdn.
 Also tested to open all ports in the vpn tunnel but the same problem occurs. 
 The strange thing is that not all clients or remote offices have this problem and they are setup identically so I can’t find what is causing this. 
 Any ideas?

 I was tasked to migrate 10 legacy asa clusters (versions 7.x-8.x, ASA-50XX) to other vendor while never worked with cisco. No ASDM available.
 As I am understanding it slowly in general, vpns were always something I had least exposure to. Could anyone suggest how to effectively confirm if VPNs are still used on those?
 Currently Im evaluating if vpns are to be migrated or no. Some have vpn configs, others don't..So on those where I see it:
 As I understand, seeing live tunnel is best direct evidence of it being used (show vpn-sessiondb)
 In case I do not see it at time of it being established - are there some stats in cli available that would tell me if it was used say last month and how many times? If no stats tied to dates, anything that could help is appreciated.

I have tried uninstalling all other versions of Office from the device, disabled firewall, and after hours of additional troubleshooting, finally resorted to completely wiping the computer and re-installing Windows 10. Even after this, with literally nothing on the computer but a stock Windows 10 install, I get this error. I decided to try installing this on a completely different computer just to test, and sure enough, that one gets the same error. Any idea how I can install the volume license version of Visio successfully?

 My draft for a new policy:
  
14 characters
 Password does not expire
 No complexity
 Also regular matching with hashes of haveibeenpwned
  
What is my goal? Users should set a secure passphrase once instead of insecure iterations of the same password over and over (password!01, password!02, and so on). The password should only be changed in case of a suspected breach.
 What do you think? I am actually quite convinced not to let passwords expire at all. But in many publications you can still read that they should rotate every 42 days. :|

 My current issue is, that I am supposed to transition support for an application to a colleague. The colleague has been involved with app support for the past two years. He has made zero contributions to any scripts, processes or improvements. A few months ago I figured out he hasn't logged into the app in several months. Now that I am transitioning support to him, he only does support when specifically asked. No insightful questions, or how does XYZ work, or request for meetings to show feature ABC. I am the one who has to chase him to show him how to do things.
 During a critical issue where I was on the call with the vendor, the colleague seemed "Away" in Teams. I told my manager (tactfully) that I need to show my colleague how the issue was resolved, but he is away. Manager just said, "Yes, continue to work with him and let him do the work".
 I have a feeling this will come back to me some how. I was thinking of keeping a record of all meetings, how-to sessions, meeting invites etc. Later on, if this does come back to me, I will just my manager what was done to transition support.

For the last 2 weeks they have experienced issues with their desk phones dropping calls and losing the ability to dial out intermittently throughout the day. No changes were made on this network before these occurrences. 
 We first called the phone vendor and asked them to troubleshoot, they told us that the phones run over the internet so as long as we can confirm internet is stable then the phones should work. They also recommended we call ATT and have them disable their SIP-ALG settings for our circuit. 
 Called ATT and had them disable SIP-ALG, but the problems continued. 
 I should also note that I have sat a full day at this clients office and monitored multiple ping tests to different internal and external devices and never noticed any drops, even when the phones would disconnect.
 This network has only a WatchGuard firewall and a netgear PoE switch in front of the phones, I've replaced both of these devices in hopes that one of them were faulty. Issue still persisted and phones continue to drop.
 Client is pissed, vendors pointing fingers, any suggestions appreciated.

 Thanks for reading! I've been lurking and laughing along with you all for a few months now. I'm hoping you can give me some advice.
 In the past few years I transitioned from a chef, to an operations manager and sys admin of a commodity trading group. They had some unsecure and inefficient practices, like all users logging into a single email account. I'm sure you can all imagine some of the other things they came up with.
 Once hired I purchased a domain, and implemented messaging software. This business receives an enormous amount of email and I really enjoyed creating systems that helped them be more aware of what was happening.
 I don't anticipate leaving but I am planning on taking courses to help me stay in the field when I need to leave this company.
 Can anyone recommend meaningful courses I can take outside of a degree that could help further my career as a sys admin?

I've been asked to set up a network at this medium-sized church and I'm not quite sure what the best option is. The ISP installed a fiber connection to replace the preexisting DSL. They installed a Cisco 4300 series router and gave us a static IP to use. Because the router belongs to them I can't configure it in any way. It doesn't have DHCP set up so I have to manually set everything up. The church already had a cisco SG350-28P 28-Port Gigabit PoE Managed Switch that they had connected directly to the Cisco router.
 ​
  
I need to know if it is possible to use the managed switch for routing or if will i need to install another router. 
 If I were to use the switch for routing what would that look like and would it pose security risks?

Today our old DC's running dual ISP and using ASR1001-X with mem upgraded to 16G with full inet routes. So for each ISP we had an ASR and then peer the two ASR's. From there we had 3850X (Stack) setup as core with EIGRP taking the default route only. Idea was just get the traffic to one of the ASR's and BGP best path would kick in. Again for the most part it worked pretty well.
 But with us stepping it up to four ISP's the old design is just not going to work, we've seem to be maxing out the ASR1001-X with two full tables (which is maxed out at 16G) so this isn't going to work.
 So looking for a Edge router that can handle two to four full inet tables. For the core thinking we can just do what we did before as these 3850X should have zero issues with 4G maxed across all four ISP's or even 40G if all upgraded to 10G each.
 Or is there something else out we should be looking at for the core switches as well?
 ​
 Thanks in advance...

 Ryan, 
 Few things beat Dr. Pepper. Especially when dealing with late-night system upgrades. 
 Trade you one month's supply (3 cases?) for 11 minutes to show you a strategy for making sure your cloud backups are secure?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to post a question without getting into the entire topology of my network environment to get people's opinions and experiences of what you all have done. We have a network change/design opportunity and I am wanting to eliminate some route redistribution between OSPF and BGP. We use BGP for WAN routers to some of our sites around the state. We have remote connectivity from all around our state via our private fiber network, DMVPN tunnels (iWAN), and various peerings with Telco providers. We do this via 2 different data centers where we peer with different Telco routers via BGP, Cisco's iWAN, and our statewide aggregation routers that connect to our private fiber network across the state. The fiber network continues to grow as we lay more and more down each year. We bring those BGP routes into OSPF via route maps that have prefix lists attached to them. I wanted to go more into BGP and stop the route redistribution wherever I can. 
 I am wondering if I should use BGP community values or route tags to allow our sites all around the state to determine what the best path to take would be. Basically every one of our remote locations have several methods of communication back to the data centers. I would like to make one path look better, and fail over, or be able to easily switch paths by changing a route map somewhere centrally to our data center. So if I change a value of a community string or route tag, all the sites switch paths at the same time, should I decide that needs to happen. Am I going down the right path here? Are route tags the best way to do this, or are community values the standard way to do this?

After we got over the hump and started growing I was promoted to management and willed myself to hold on to my task, do automation, keep up with new technology, become the one stop shop for Azure. It all came to a head last week and I walked out for a long weekend breather. Quieting my mind I think I have determined I simply cannot be everyone, be an individual contributor, and manage. I have to pick. I think I am going to continue to be a manager, grow my team, and be the muscle that moves the company's technology forward.
 I still have the desire to learn Linux, establish powershell 7, get into Ansible, make the assets management system and much more but I guess those days are going to have to be behind me.
 Has this realization come to any of you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, So basically I am a developer (front end web and backend) but for years I always messed around with web hosting. Setting up servers, etc. I’ve always been SUPER into hardware (passion).
 But lately I’ve been setting up our new hosting servers for the company im at because they trusted me enough to move from managed hosting environment to rented servers where we manage the hosting ourselves.
 Most hosting clients are past clients where we made their sites. We host a few hundred but obviously want to increase.
 Im looking into collocation, but honestly I’m super surprised at the cost of servers. We are in South Africa so there aren’t many big DC providers. So only when we get a few servers would we look at collocation, but how “worth it” is hardware like Xeon CPU’s? I see there are now some new Intel consumer level CPUs that support ECC, and most new AMD CPUs support ECC. So for largely Wordpress and NodeJS environments is there an issue with going with AMD? Is there something I’m missing?
 Honestly I’m just not sure where to start with hardware, I’ve learnt what I can in theory, but real world reasons for certain choices, and advice is very different. 
 This post was a bit of a ramble but I guess I’m just looking for any good nuggets from you pros 🙂

 Is there any way, at all, to reset the password on a notebook like this, or am I forced to send it in? I'm no stranger to disassembling laptops, but would like to refrain from anything voiding the warranty (so soldering out EPROMs is out of question, unfortunately).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a network that has Server 2016 running DHCP, Sophos UTM 9 firewall, 3 Cisco CBS250 switches and Unifi access points. They are running out of IP addresses at this location, and I was wanting to create a new SSID and put it on a different IP range so that users can connect devices to that network and work with their mobile devices and laptops.
 I have setup a VLAN for that the SSID in Unifi and created a new Scope in the DHCP server. I also set the firewall DHCP relay to point to the DHCP server so anything looking for those requests can find that IP range. 
 I have setup something like this a few times in other devices using Unifi but in this current setup I am unfamiliar with Cisco and Sophos. I have figured a lot out by Googling and watching videos but I can’t seem to find this exact scenario that I am trying to recreate. 
 I am wondering if I can just setup the DHCP scope, set the network inside of Unifi with the new IP range and point the DHCP relay to the firewall without using VLAN or if I need to use VLAN how I can get it to function properly across the network.
 Do I have to create a VLAN in the Sophos for this or do I just need to tag the firewall and point the DHCP relay back to the server? Also the switches are Layer 3 which I honestly have never used personally. I have been reading up about them but still unclear how I can utilize the layer 3 in this situation. 
 I hope my post doesn’t get locked this time for being low quality. I hardly ever ask anyone for help when trying to do stuff and figure it out on my own but this one has me over thinking everything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having this conversation now with a smaller shop. They want to set up a new NAS with RAID syncing to a second NAS at a remote site. They already had a setup like this running with WD Blue HDDs but it's almost 10 years old and ready to update. The admin there read he needs "enterprise drives" and I'm like no you don't. They are more than three times the cost of the SSDs in the drive and for this setup way overkill. 
 15-20 years ago when hard drives weren't nearly as reliable I'd more inclined to agree but now not so much. Especially when the place I work at has well over a million SSDs and HDDs in their DCs around the world and all of them are your standard off-the-shelf Western Digitals or Seagates and it's running fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am designing a hypothetical network for a homework assignment. It is fairly simple thus far, but this question I have is proving more difficult to answer than I expected. I have watched networking educational videos, I've looked for sources, but it seems that my firewall implementation idea is somehow novel, though I am certain it is not. Or, perhaps it is such a dumb idea that it does not exist online. 
 I want to segment my network. Simple enough. My idea was to use firewalls at the edge of each network segment ("star" topology central router leads to firewalls at each outgoing port for the various departments) for high security. 
 Is this... Reasonable? I only seem to find network segmenting that simply uses switches, but with no firewall other than that which leads to the WAN or DMZ. Additionally, how would these firewalls generally be configured? I would imagine I could allow only the ports that are reasonable for that segment's network usage?
 Also, can I use application proxy gateways at the edge of network segments? Online sources imply that proxies should only be used at the outside edge of the LAN. I want one proxy for one department, but a different proxy for another. Each then accessing the central router of the star topology. 
 TL;DR can firewalls be reasonably used as a security measure for multiple internal network segments? What might that look like for security purposes? Same question for application proxy gateways?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we have two buildings, eight units in each building, and we are looking at doing a bulk internet deal for them.
 We are deciding between a line of sight (microwave?) Service with asynchronous up/down speeds vs dedicated modems to each unit via cable provider.
 Both offers are priced similarly and have 5 year contract terms. (4-5% yearly increase in price) The microwave provider is everywhere wireless. They would deploy redundant equipment, backup power supplies, and service equipment. We own it after 7 years. Speeds are 500Mbps or 1 Gbps, but not higher at the moment.
 My question.. I'm not sure how to evaluate the microwave offering and if it will be superior to the cable modem in each unit. Latency/jitter, etc. What should we consider? I can ask one of their other recent deployments to test their system.
 From a risk perspective, the DOCSIS4 rollout will possibly drive down prices of cable offerings (at least introductory prices), and we'll be paying more in three years than we negotiate today.

 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI.
 I'd prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped.
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

 I may choose a Dell Mobile Workstation for work. Does anyone have any experience?
 There are two for me to choose from:
 Dell Precision 3570
 Dell Precision 3571
 According to the following ranking, the 3570's processor is ranked 47th and the 3571's is ranked 1st, but the 3570 has 16GB more RAM (for a total of 32GB). 
 I use the Dell 27" S2721DGFA monitor twice. The 3571's graphics card is slightly better than the 3570's according to the following ranking.
 No special programs are used. Office, browser, a few VPN clients, anti-virus software, vulnerability scans. I work a lot in the browser. Important for me is a good performance. That's it. 
 My questions:
 Which one is better for very fast and reliable "office" work?
 What are the differences between the two?
 Or is it worthwhile to put one together yourself? That would look like this. However, I can't find anything about the integrated Intel graphics card GT2 and I don't know if it can handle two 27" monitors.
 I am very much looking forward to your feedback and thank you in advance. :)

In our environment (mostly server 2012 r2 and 2016) we have a server that is used by a third party company to run reports. For this they require local admin access. About 6 weeks ago, three of these accounts stopped being able to launch most apps, all except for windows accessories and office 365 apps (fat)
 These users are members of the local admins group, they are also part of an ad group that is also in local admins. Launching any other application gives the error ‘this operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer’
 These accounts are only a problem with this server, it’s the only one they would normally access
 I’ve cleared down the local accounts from there, including the registry. I’ve also just created the default app locker execution rules in group policy. These accounts have full unrestricted access to the server but still can’t launch other applications and services. Unfortunately this includes CMD, so even running a gpresult is proving difficult. Anyone had a similar issue?

 I started new job, where I will need to do windows server, Azure Vm and VMware host patching
 there are very few servers no WSUS employed or anything else, because they will go away sooner or later 
 my manager asked me about my plan to patch those servers/hosts 
 they are mixes of dev and production 
 I am thinking:
 -Update windows servers when update released (every month) and when critical update is been pushed 
 -Create snapshot for VM before update (is this necessary?)
 -Update VMware server software when new update is released (minor updates for the same version)
 -Update the production servers off hours 
 -Test updates (by running the application and testing all functions)
 -Rollback update if test went wrong
 -For Switches, update one switch after making copy from configurations with old FW
 -Test the switches and be ready to rollback to backup file
 ​
 ​
 is there any ideas or things I need to add to the plan?
 ​
 thanks in advanced

 just a new 2019 VM with VPN and somehow enable 2FA on that.

The few I have investigated redirected to a 365 sign in when you click "review document" or to a static file with an incoherent message that I presume they are trying to get you to download. So I am assuming malware delivery and credential harvesting. All I can say is thank god for MFA and poorly designed fake documents. However I worry its going to hit the right person where the fake document makes sense, like a plausible contract, and the user actually downloads and opens. 
 Besides education is there a better way to lock this down other then blocking DocuSign and having to manually release.

That said, the device still makes you pick a 'primary' circuit and seems to be using that one exclusively for my testing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, I stumbled upon a P2P cli file transfer software named croc (https://github.com/schollz/croc), however there is some terminology in the read-me I couldn't quite understand.
 Under the Self-Host Relay section it says:
  
The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections.
  
Now I did find articles on OCSP Stapling but this doesn't seem to apply here (correct me if I'm wrong). In a blog post the creator, when talking about how croc works, explains:
  
There are better ways than sequentially uploading and downloading. Instead, you can use a relay server to create a full-duplex real-time communication layer between the two computers so that “uploading” and “downloading” occur simultaneously between the two computers.
  
Which in context sounds a lot like NAT hole punching. Is this just a misuse of the term stapling or is stapling something completely different / nonsense? Thanks in advance!

Each department has maybe 10-15 computers and multiple machines connected . The networking was done here and there and with different types of cable over the past 10 years. Now things are running slow in one of the departments. We planned to run a new cat6 cable (100m) directly to the main switch. Is it worth it? Is it better to have a fiber cable with a converter on each end between two switches? The main use is transfering small files between computers/machines but during peak hours when most people are connected to the network, stuff stops working well and connections get interrupted

 1) Could the router have redundancy even if the above protocol is not used? (Is it thru the access list? route-map configuration ??)
 2) How to check if both routers are redundant?
 3) if Back to back access is unavailable, Could someone help with the configuration? (no physical cable is connected between both the device to get access to primary via backup or vice versa)

 I've defined DCHP pools on the router, and created five VLANs on the switches (using VTP) based on ports. I'm now trying to assign each DCHP pool to a VLAN, but I can't find a solution to do so.
 For example, a user connecting on the port 1 (VLAN 1) would get an IP in the DHCP pool named "VLAN1".
 Do you have any idea on how I could implement that on these switch?
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of background about myself:
  
I'm a high school student, soon to graduate.
 I've had an interest in Network Engineering for about two years.
 I've developed knowledge in BGP (RPKI filtering & MP-BGP), OSPF (multi-area & summarisation), VPNs (WG & IPsec) and some Network Automation (Python OOP stuff & Drone CI/CD).
 Have picked up some Docker and Linux stuff as well.
  
I'm starting an internship at a High Frequency Trading Firm in London, with their network team. It's likely that they will give me a return offer.
 I've looked into HFT networks and found that multicast is used a lot (to receive market data from exchanges). I'm planning to set up a multicast IPTV server and run some packet captures to become more familiar with it. Also, I've read whitepapers on the switching platforms that the firm uses.
 Is there anything major to HFT networks I'm missing?
 I hope this doesn't break rule #5, I thought that r/networking would be the best place to ask about such a niche industry.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have this old windows 2012 server (I know, I know), it is configured and responding to an IP on the 10.8.1.x subnet, it is attached to a Cisco switch via cat 5e. It has several nics but only one active (not disabled). The server isn't set up with any virtualization. The issue is that the switch is showing 2 Mac addresses coming in on the same port that the server is attached to, arp shows another IP address , associated with a Mac address that is sequentially 1 higher (last digit) than the configured nic on the server, it also has an IP address in the same subnet as the one configured on the server so it would appear as though it would possibly be a secondary port on the nic. The server responds to pings on this secondary IP, nmap scans show only udp 68 being open on this IP. Here is the weird part, the machine doesn't show the IP being configured anywhere, ipconfig doesn't even list the Mac nor the IP of this secondary IP. Running Wireshark while pinging the secondary IP shows what you would expect from a configured nic, except it isn't configured anywhere that I can find...any suggestions on locating where this is coming from would be greatly appreciated.

 Essentially we want to build an IoT environment using MQTT as the message protocol. We want to model this environment and simulate the message flow & bandwidth utilization. It's a simple publisher > broker > multiple subscribers chain. 
 Our aim is to play around with the values and perform certain what-if scenarios. (e.g if there's a message spike, can the bandwidth manage? How long would it take for all my subscribers to receive the payload?) 
 Is there a easy modeling tool that is able to do this? A simple system A sending data to system B. I can vary the bandwidth, payload size and frequency and output the bandwidth utilization

Same if I figure something out for myself, etc. Over 3-4 jobs now I've carried the same OneNote file with me and added to it, but I'm falling out of love with OneNote.
 I was thinking about an alternative like Evernote, but it doesn't seem to have the same simplicity that OneNote has, sadly. If I could import my notes without having to copy-paste everything, I'd certainly give Evernote a try, but I like to have things organised under tabs (Network, Security, VMware, Wifi, etc) and have my various pages categorised that way. I'd also need to figure out if Evernote can do this too.
 What do you use for your personal notetaking? What does it do that you like? What does it do that you don't like? Thanks for any input to the discussion.

 Client uses a service running on their server to monitor a folder and upload documents to a server over HTTPS.
 Pcap shows handshake looks good, TLS session is negotiated without issue, but once the actual file upload starts, things stop working right. The client will typically send 2-3 packets for any given chunk, but the server only ACKs the first packet. The client then retransmits the next two packets and then gets an ACK for each. So far so good - a bit messy, but at least traffic is flowing.
 Then we get to the very last packet - on the last packet of the session, we end up waiting for 35-40 seconds before we finally get an ACK from the server an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT:UPDATE-my question was answered and pointed in a better direction. Turns out I should have probably posted in a industrial automation sub. Thanks for the info. 
 Are there switches on the market that support RSTP with multiple rings in a switch. I am a design engineer for a BAS manufacturer and the industry is migrating out of rs485 twisted pair to using RSTP compatible switches with a Ring topology to keep costs low on the networking side. For example do switches allow you to set a root and backup port for multiple rings or are you limited to one failover port per switch. I imagine there are a wide range of options based on cost but this would be in the area of 3-5 rings per switch at most for very large networks. 
 To clarify the end goal is to move into An IP friendly physical layer that maintains the cost effectiveness of daisy chains while using ring topology to give a fail over route if the cable is ever damaged/or enough nodes fail we exceed 100m between devices that are online. 
 The current direction looks like a small 8 port industrial switch per network but I grow curious if there could be cost benefit to a single switch 18/24/48 port that could have multiple networks on 1.

Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats. 
Operational technology/industrial control system (OT/ICS) assets that operate, control, and monitor day-to-day critical infrastructure and industrial processes continue to be an attractive target for malicious cyber actors. These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!
