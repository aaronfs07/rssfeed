        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have a strange case with NTLM.
 I've configured my domain controllers, servers & clients to use LAN Manager Authentication Level : Send NTLMv2 response only, Refuse LM & NTLM.
 I've double checked everything, even in the registry LSA -> Lmcompatibility is 5. 
 If I look into the domain controllers security event viewer, I still see pretty much events with NTLM v1 successful logons (event 4624). I think that this is because of certain computers which aren't using the FQDN to connect to a share. 
 I'm just worried why it still shows me NTLM v1.... All the devices are W10, W11 & W2016 and as I understood, it should enforce NTLM v2.
 Do I miss something ? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 I've installed MIM many times but this will be the first install with a multi server instance (active and standby)
 Ive installed SharePoint on one server. But i need to install Mim on another server. So when trying to install SharePoint. I am trying to connect to the database. But it says I selected a single server farm.
 So my question is. When selecting the role in SharePoint install on initial server. Which option should I select?
 None of the options seem close to what I want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I've been trying for a few days to setup a IKEv2 PSK (for simplicity) VPN server. This server should run as a virtual machine on a proxmox deployment. I've disabled proxmox's firewall for this specific machine 
 The host is behind a Mikrotik CRS326 router, on which i have configured port forwarding for ports 500 and 4500 UDP to the VPN server (at 192.168.1.7) in the dstnat chain, the firewall rules to allow traffic on those ports via the UDP ports are also in place. 
 The current /etc/ipsec.conf config is this one: 
 config setup
 charondebug="ike 1, knl 1, cfg 0"
 uniqueids=no
 ​
 conn ikev2-vpn
 auto=add
 compress=no
 type=tunnel
 keyexchange=ikev2
 fragmentation=yes
 forceencaps=yes
 ike=aes256-sha1-modp1024,3des-sha1-modp1024!
 esp=aes256-sha1,3des-sha1!
 dpdaction=clear
 dpddelay=300s
 rekey=no
 left=%any
 leftid=192.168.1.7
 leftcert=/etc/ipsec.d/certs/vpn-server-cert.pem
 leftsendcert=always
 leftsubnet=0.0.0.0/0
 right=%any
 rightid=%any
 rightauth=eap-mschapv2
 rightdns=192.168.1.1
 rightsourceip=10.20.30.0/24
 rightsendcert=never
 eap_identity=%identity
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When i try to connect i see exactly one packet on port 500 on mikrotik's counter for firewall rules, well, NAT rules in this case and that's it, nothing more, the phone i'm testing this with gives up and states "disconnected", the whole process take 1-2 seconds. 
 I really have 0 idea what i did wrong.

 I am working on an assignment which basically has the question of identifying an exploit with a relevant CVE that would allow for TCP session identification. The closest I could find to this was CVE-1999-0667 with ARP spoofing, where the cache is poisoned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
 I am however confused, as I do not know if this constitutes as an exploit or just a technique within an exploit. I tried my hardest to skim through thousands of CVEs to see if there were any exploits related to the identification of TCP sessions, but most of them were just denial-of-service attacks.
 I would appreciate some clarification on this topic because I am just so lost

I knew that one of the redundant power cables had come loose but as this was a major switch 2k users were passing through, not to mention public facing infrastructure, I put that aside while I tried every single thing I could think of to fix the 40% packet loss on a major interface (we were also getting minor packet loss on other interfaces but I didn’t find out till late in the troubleshooting process) when I finally had given up I was about to get Cisco TAC and out vendor support involved. As I was waiting on the phone for support I plugged in the redundant power into a less loose pdu and BAM!!! no packet loss across the board. Is this an rma issue or have I missed something?

 I get that a SYN/ACK would be used in this case over a proxy server, but is that it? I am unsure if I am missing an extra step here, but from what I understand, the target host replying with its on SYN/ACK confirms it is alive. After this, I do not know if the scanner host would send a RST or an ACK to the target network.

I have been asked to retrieve some of the data on this unit so I don’t think I should do that. Does anyone know of any other options? 
 Also, I cant seem to find any technical documentation on this unit. With the WD and DDN acquisitions I have no idea where to get any documentation….. or what support number I can call. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve been working with WSUS for the last 6yrs now with plenty of headaches I’d like to get rid of. So I’m reaching out to find some other patch management suggestions. We are a small business, I’m sure we can manage about 5k/yr but I’m trying to find something a little lower on the cost side if any. Also, if the solution could inventory the machines and present what patches are needed by machines (similar to WSUS), that would be a bonus. So what do you all have for me?

The link, if you have it, is https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?ref=MessageCenter/:/messages/MC541626 If you don't have it, here are the screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/qVMQxbl
 Basically it's a new feature coming where when you click a link in an email in Outlook on Windows, it opens Edge with a copy of the email as a side panel. Sounds kind of neat.
 But to make sure everyone experiences this, Outlook will also start ignoring your system's default web browser and opening links in Edge no matter what. Users whose default has always been Chrome, and whose bookmarks and saved passwords are all in Chrome, will be highly confused by a very similar-looking browser that has none of their stuff. They'll probably call the helpdesk screaming "why did you delete all my stuff?!?!"
 The user can change this in settings, but options being offered for admins to shut this off is lacking. Both options listed (the cloud policy service and group policy) explicitly apply only to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (not business).
 So, for SMBs there seems to be no way out besides manually touching each machine. Of course, it remains to be seen if perhaps the end-user setting is in a registry key instead of some secret place... we can only hope...

This is a company that has very, very few people leave and many come back after doing so. I just can't escape a feeling of shame for not being able to make it. It wasn't the work, it was a few people that saw me as their personal Easy Button. I tried to get my manager to separate me from them but they wouldn't do so. Is it irrational to think that I failed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week my employer (a large robotics company) hired an MSP to work as our help desk. We had a different MSP for 10 years but due to some contract negotiation differences, we could not come to an agreement. The new MSP needed Jump boxes in the environment to use as administration systems to work from. 
 ​
 They requested 18 boxes 1 for each person. the box requested was a server 2016+ and local admin rights plus rights to have basic administration of DNS, DHCP, etc. We provided the boxes and the accounts. 
 ​
 Today (yay Friday!) I happen to refresh my server manager and find a few new ADCS boxes. So I looked at all servers on the network to find what roles were installed. I found many jump boxes had ADCS, ADFS, ADDS, DHCP, DNS, and ADLDS. etc. Many even had LDS instances. 
 ​
 I contacted the Helpdesk manager and asked why these servers have these roles installed when they are only meant for jump boxes and they didn't follow the documented change management process. 
 He then proceeded to respond "We needed these so we could administrate these services on the servers," I asked him why they didn't use RSAT because installing these roles leaves the environment up to more risks. He seemed surprised at the existence of RSAT. 
 ​
 I am very frustrated that the MSP would install and configure critical roles on jump boxes in the environment but I am also Dumbfounded that the basic tools for administration seemed to be unknown to them and it makes me question their knowledge. They to me seem to be a huge risk at this point. 
 ​
 Would it be a deal breaker for anyone here? Would you cancel the contract?

 The vast majority of users send MAYBE 1 ticket a week, and are very relaxed but in any company I have worked for there is always a small handful of individuals who have an issue every other day. its always an emergency and the ticket is so vague that you always have to spend 4 emails just to figure out what the problem is.
 The week started with it was "Excel not working" < The application was working fine, the issue was that they incorrectly formatted an excel formula. 
 Wednesday (8am): "Cant connect, please assist" < Turns out they decided to WFH, knows damn well we disable VPN accounts inactive for 2 weeks, and neglected to advise us. 
 Thursday it was: "My computer isn't working, tried restart" < This one was actually an issue, But I checked task manager and they did not reboot the machine, in 5 days. A reboot fixed the issue
 just now, Friday 4PM "The scanner needs to be cleaned" *send PHOTO of a screen with a notification* saying "IF your scanned doc has vertical lines it needs to be cleaned". 22 minutes later I am still waiting to see a document that has vertical lines. The scanned document is FINE...
 The most hilarious part of this is they claim to have taken a post secondary I.T course.

 Our current environment is Windows Server and laptop based using local AD synced to Azure and Exchange Online.
 My co-worker in IT, which also turns out to be a middle manager, wants to transition the company (small to medium sized) from Windows based laptops to Chromebooks. My co-worker believes there will be less maintenance of the devices themselves such as constantly dealing with driver issues (Dell), plus they're much cheaper. 
 Obviously we'd have to virtualize any app so it can be accessible through a browser, which only would be a couple or so, and we'd have to start managing the devices via MDM. We would keep Exchange Online and Azure for email and authentication. 
 I'm trying my hardest to keep an open mind about this as I do not want to be a hinderance to new ideas, and this would fall mostly on me to make this transition happen, at least infrastructure wise.
 I would just like to know what any of y'all think of the idea of transitioning to Chromebook based laptops/tablets.

Working with a new var on upgrading an asr9910, requirements for the card ports are 6 40 gig ports and a handful of 10 gig with the possibility of upgrading two 40 gig ports to 100. A quote for a a9k-8hg-flex-fc was coming out to 174k per card with a 177k license per card for a 400g license which seems high. An original quote for a 400g line card with the bare minimum ports was about 60k each and 60 for the license. Is this just obnoxiously high or just cisco? Anyone have similar quotes from juniper or nokia? Those would be a full chassis quote at this point. The total bw on the backplane doesn’t go above 200g with a potential of upgrading to 3-340g.

 You already have procured the replacements and they are sitting in your storage.

If I set my "Configure authorized password decryptors" gpo to use a group like mydomain\LAPS Admins when I run Get-LapsADPassword it tells me I'm unauthorized to decrypt the password even though I'm in that group. If I instead set the gpo to mydomain\myuser instead of the group it works fine, but then my other admins can't decrypt though, anyone else run into this issue and know a fix?
 Edit: Thanks for the replies, it was just another case of being impatient. Went and did something else for 30 minutes or so and checked again and I could read the password fine with the group assignment.

 (for instance, teaming 2 NICs for a vmware vSwitch)
 Speed? Reliability? Load balancing for some reason?
 The reason i ask is that i have teamed NICs for the vSwitches in a few esx servers, but mostly because thats how it was set up on the first esx server i saw.
 I dont think that teaming two 1gbit NICs gives much better speed (for me, here).
 Both NICs are connected to the same switch, and the router mostly only has 1gbit NICs anyway, so i dont think much traffic would go over that limit anyway.
 And yeah, both NICs are connected to the same switch, so if that breaks its bye bye anyway.
 But yeah, i get some redundancy if one port on that dual-port card breaks i guess.
 Anyway, when you team NICs, do you always make sure they are connected to separate switches?
 And what more to think of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, I've seen many debates about the value of certs.
 Just 3.5 months into my full-time career, I've landed a 'Senior Network & Security Analyst' role, and I believe truly having my CCNA helped A TON.
 First off, the last thing I'm trying to do here is brag/gloat. This is an anonymous forum and no-one knows me here. Simply trying to share my experience so that it can hopefully help others.
 For background, I have 1 year (three 4 month co-ops) internship experience, and have been working at my full time role for 3.5 months.
 Before anyone says anything about the 'validity' of the role/company, my new company is a huge employer and big bank.
 I understand this is Reddit and you should take my post with a grain of salt. You might have huge skepticism over if this is a true post or not.
 Luck/timing plays a big role. Clearly I don't have 'senior' level experience, but I do interview well, do have some work experience, but most importantly, I have my CCNA and DevNet, along with some network automation projects I listed on my resume (and no, not just simple projects from school. These are my own individual projects). I believe these factors were a massive help in me landing the role (the role said CCNP would be a nice-to-have and that automation experience was a plus).
 Another myth I want to shatter is about applying to jobs 'out of your league'. Again, by all accounts I should not have landed the role as I am only 3.5 months into my full-time career. But clearly there weren't too many eligible candidates and my new employer is deciding to take a chance on me.
 So just apply to any and every job that catches your eye. And there is absolutely no arbitrary 'time' you have to stay at a job before you want to move. I am the proof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on upgrading our switches to IBNS 2.0 config and up till now I've had little to no issues.
 We have mostly 3850s with a handful of 9XXX series switch's and just a few 2960c's
 I think I'm running into a bug with these ones. We have the port template use a parked vlan (666) and we do vlan assignment via ISE policy. When I try to do this on this switch it seems to tear down the mab session and repeat it forever. ISE logs show repeated successes and the debugs show successful vlan, dacl and SGT assignment but then immediately tear down and start over. My work around has been to just blow out the template onto the port statically as well as set the vlan statically everything works fine if I do that. and I'm fine with keeping it that way for now. However I'd still like to know. I'm likely to put in a tac case today but I'd figure I'd share in case anyone else is in my boat. 
 I've got a switch on my desk with more or less the same config and I'm unable to replicate the issue at least most of the time. Although I don't have 100% the same endpoints to test with.
 anyway here is the switch facts:
 WS-C2960C-8PC-L 15.2(7)E7 C2960c405-UNIVERSALK9-M

 Running config: https://pastebin.com/ETUVA3JU
 Debug of an example endpoint:
 debug radius authentication

 debug radius verbose

The two easiest solutions I could come up with are switch it to a PVLAN or setup the host firewalls and just block traffic from the DMZ subnet. Harder solution would be split the VLAN up which would require readdressing the servers.
 Since I don't manage the servers, I think the PVLAN is the best solution I could implement. Anyone have their DMZ setup like this? Any downsides or concerns I may be overlooking? Most use-cases I see when researching are for segmenting customer traffic or guest networks.

 Im bad at explaining this but i need bullet points i can hit with so that i can argue why i need a raise. 
 I do all the normal stuff a ~10000 user networking engineer/professional does, but im looking at things i might have overlooked but can be classified as specialized work.
 I feel like this is harder than nessecary, as daily upkeepings and tickets keeps rolling in they dont nessecarily keep increasing in complexity, but the hole of everything still gets expanded daily. 
 Again. Just looking at pointers and maybe even normal operations that may be deemed as things to be taking with me in negotiations in the next conversation.

I have a 4G LTE testbed network that I'm trying to do some performance testing on. The network essentially looks like this.

Essentially, traffic goes LAN client -> pfSense router -> Juniper Router -> Nokia NDAC Core (HPE) -> Juniper Router -> eNB -> RAN server
 The problem
 iPerf tests initiated from a LAN client to a RAN server always show the same weird output, mostly 0s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi wonderful Reddit community! I am in IT but not in networking specifically. I was hoping someone smart here could help me with the puzzle I have.
 Preface: Long time ago a very experienced networking engineer told me to never run a single ping packet. This is because, even aside of packet drops, there could be some other problems (if I recall correctly, related to ARP resolution) that may fail connection on the first ping, but succeed on subsequent ones.
 Some facts (all of this is true with default parameters): * When in Windows I ping something it runs 4 pings. * When in Linux I ping something it pings continuously. * When in PowerShell I use Test-Connection it runs 4 pings. * When in PowerShell I use Test-NetConnection it runs one ping (validated with WireShark).
 Question: Can someone tell me if that networking engineer was right?
 Bonus question: If that networking engineer was right, does that mean that Test-NetConnection is a bad command?
 (Please don’t dig deep into command parameters, ports etc. - the question is about icmp)

We moved into a shared office space with another business, we are both using Shaw as our provider, me with the business plan and them with the home plan. As soon as I arrive at the office and connect to our company WiFi me and the guy across from me (other business) start dropping connection. Sometimes we drop connection a few times a day, sometimes I can only maintain connection for 2-3 minutes at a time, dropping connection intermittently. Our SSID's are on different channels, and our modems are both running through the same coax cable with a splitter. My company is running a Meraki for WiFi with the modem bridged, they are connecting directly to their modem. Does anyone have any idea why our WiFi would be interfering with each other?

 Identicly deployed the 365 apps for enterprise to roughly 25 RDS session hosts via ODT, all working fine bar one host which is refusing to activate any users licence, after signing in with an appropriately licenced user or users I still get the big dirty ' (non commercial use) (unlicenced Product)' across the top.
 ​
  
I can't see any firewall issue, local windows firewall is disabled like the other hosts, and I can't see anything stopping the traffic, it is in the same network as the other working session hosts.
 I have tried usual reinstall/repairs both online and offline.
 Redeploy via ODT again it installs again ok but fails to activate.
 tried clearing credential manager.
 Tried running the support and recovery assitant tool.
 https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant-for/29323f9a-899b-4d08-b21d-ca697c7594c0
 running the clean up scripts provided by MS:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/activation/reset-office-365-proplus-activation-state#sectionb
 Verified the registry value for shared licensing is set to 1.
 I am able to get to the sign in prompt, but it doesn't go anything with the creds, no username is registered so I can returned the sign in option again.
  
​
 Just wondering if anyone has come accross a really obscure answer to this one?

 Any suggestions appreciated!

 Cisco N5K-C56128P (Cisco UPC) € 1200,- ENHANCED_LAYER2 , Lan base + lan enterprise license included.
 Juniper QFX5100 maybe, but cannot find it with the layer3 licenses.
 A former colleague say that for VXLAN it is best to stay away from the Nexus 5k series.

 Anyone have any ideas/tips? Which ASIC chipset are recommended for VXLAN/EVPN (within budget)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone,
 Sorry if this isn't quite the right sub for this post. I have a question about a setup I came across at a small business. I didn't set it up, but the current setup doesn't really make sense to me so I'd like some help understanding.
 The business has two DSL connections. The first one is their internet connection. 
 The second one is just creating a secure connection to a remote server that they need to access. The remote server they are accessing is at 100.100.0.1. This DSL modem is expecting a client to connect on port LAN4 at a client IP of 100.50.50.254, with a default gateway of 100.50.50.1. If I connect my laptop to LAN4, assign a static IP of 100.50.50.254, and a default gateway of 100.50.50.1, I can ping 100.100.0.1 no problem. That all makes sense. 
 They are using a Cisco RV042G as their primary Router/Firewall. This router has a WAN port and a WAN/DMZ port. Currently it is configured in WAN + DMZ mode. 
 The WAN port is connected to their first DSL modem, the modem is in Bridge Mode, and the router is setup to login using PPPoe. All internet traffic is routed through this connection.
 In the settings for the DMZ port, it has the option to select a subnet or range. Subnet is selected, and an IP of 100.50.50.254 is inputted in there. There is then a static route setup for 100.100.0.1, to be routed out the DMZ Interface. 
 My understanding is the DMZ port as configured is supposed to be used to give a direct internet connection to a specific device, keeping it seperate from your LAN, and bypassing all firewall rules. 
 But how it is being used is more like a dual WAN setup, with no Failover or Load Balancing, but where all internet traffic is routed out one WAN port, and only specific traffic is routed out the second WAN port. 
 Can anyone help clear up what is going on here, and what would be the preferred way of setting this up? Thanks,

 My question is, is, can you install hyper V in such a way that you don’t have the entire windows OS under it? That way all you’re running is hyper V on the bare metal with all of the VMs under it. (Dell Servers) 
 It’s just something I’ve never researched or known if it’s possible 
 To be honest, I’ve never installed the server OS without the GUI.
 I’m just really admitting my ignorance I’m just curious. To see if there’s a better way sometimes it seems like a waste to have the full OS just sitting there doing nothing when hyper V is doing 99% of the work on the post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi does anyone know if a server 2016 on prem running exchange can be hybrid Azure AD joined? 
 (I’m not talking about hybrid exchange) 
 I am in the process of onboarding servers to MDE and noticed that our exchange server is not listed in Azure AD as a device. Running dsregcmd /status shows it’s only joined to ADDS, it’s OU is part of the Azure AD connect sync, issue seems to be it will not add certs to the local personal cert store and Workplace Join task exits with 0x1 response. 
 I can’t find documentation if an exchange server can be joined like this. Because it does not show in Azure it means I can assign it to the Azure AD group for MDE settings. 
 Anyone got any ideas ? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning! 
 We recently installed a NUC11TNBV7 device in a room with a NEC monitor. To connect the device to the monitor we had to use a USB C to displayport cable. 
 The NUC displays an image when first turned on, but if the monitor is power cycled, the image stays black, and eventually the monitor will go back to sleep since it's not receiving an image. 
 I've updated the thunderbolt drivers, the bios, and the VGA drivers in the NUC but nothing seems to work. I've checked the power plan settings on the device as well as adjusting to maximum performance in the BIOS. 
 Interesting enough, unlike the other nucs in the room, when you vnc into the device with the monitor off it shows the full 1920x1080 and a monitor connected, while the older nucs revert to 800x600 and no monitor connected. 
 Due to the configuration of this room, using the HDMI out of the NUC is currently not an option. My next step will be to order an active HDMI to displayport cable. 
 Our NUC10's have no issue using USB-C to DP. I'm Curious if anyone else has any experience with USB-C display out issues with these NUC11 and if you have a solution.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our telecom team is moving off of our old on-prem VoIP and going to a cloud hosted solution. We tried to future proof ourselves years ago so we have ample campus bandwidth (small user count, 10G everywhere, DC and user traffic totally separated) so we never had a real reason to try and shoot ourselves in the foot with a bad QoS policy - but now with projects winding down we all collectively decided that now is a good time to take a look at it.
 I've been going through Cisco Live's breakout sessions and am starting to get a grasp, but the whole "cloud hosted VoIP" piece is throwing a wrench in my machine. Below are the guidelines that I'm trying to follow:
  
Marking DSCP as close to the source as possible - We're moving off of Cisco phones, so part of my testing is to use "auto qos voice trust" and see if the DSCP values stick with non-Cisco phones at the access port level, not just uplinks.
 QoS policies in hardware, not software
 Specifically call out VoIP as EF/AF46/COS5
  
Where I'm really lost is the cloud bit. As far as I know, ISPs don't give a toss about your DSCP markings and we aren't peering directly with this cloud service, so while the QoS that we haven't needed before would (well, might if we dont mess it up) work internally, all this work is going to be for nothing if we ship VoIP packets out into the wild internet and they get trampled.
 Is this just part of the known risk when going to a cloud service? I've asked for some technical documentation from them and we will have meeting where I can pepper them with questions, I'm just trying to get my ducks in a row and not be an IT dinosaur. 
 VoIP in the cloud, exciting times.
 Quick edit, I'm heavily leaning on this Cisco Live BRKCRS-2501 session and have a QoS book queued up in O'Reilly Books that I'll chew on over the next month

 One of our domain controller which is physical computer installed in a other site far away from my office, has no trust relation with our Active Directory, so it’s impossible for us to access it anymore. It happened after a “little” mistake was made. Basically this server is gonna be replaced and we need to clone it and redeploy it on a new VM in our hyperV cluster, for a specific software installed on it. So the clone was done, using disk2vhd cloning C: of that server, and mounted on a new VM, the new vm wasn’t connected with network until the IP was changed, but to change the name of that new VM, it was needed to downgrade the VM from DC to non DC, and to do this it had to be connected to the network, and it’s at that moment where we had the conflict, which made our physical machine loose the trust relationship and removed itself from our AD.
 Has anyone of you an idea on how to make the physical server re join our AD and being able to connect on it ? Beside going physically on site where the server is located which is a 6 hour drive from office. We can’t connect with any AD account because no trust relation, and no local account possible because it’s a domain controller.
 Sorry for my bad English, not my native language,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So hi,
 i am somewhat lost about how to proceed here.
 for as long as i can remember, i had no problem to propagate a specific website as startpage/homepage via policy, including those that are defined as "preferred" or "not locked", be it either per group policy for edge & chrome, or policies.json in Firefox.
 what exactly happens when a new policy, defined as "preferred" or "not locked" is applied, but a different setting already exists for a user?
 because all of sudden, i am getting a heap load of complaints, that for two different customers, and two different browsers (edge & firefox), the browser does not load the correct new startpage we have set per policy. for one customer, in edge it's set per GPO and for the other customer, in firefox it's set via policies.json.
 for firefox i was able to verify, one user has the old homepage set in his profile prefs.js. when i remove this, the policy applies as it should. the user didn't change anything homepage related on his end, he doesn't even touch firefox at all as he prefers edge. all users i talked to assert they have not set another homepage, and still there seem to be some user-specific changes to said setting. is there any way a differing setting could end up in the user-specific settings by other means?
 anyways, it appears the per-user-setting has priority. did this behaviour change recently? because i can't remember i've ever had this much trouble with policies like these before, and since 1-2 month ago, an alarming amount of people report this problem...

This was only discovered after finding that the logs had been filling up for over a year and auto-archiving, ending up generating over 840GB of logs over that time span. I can't find any reason for this system to be doing this.
 The other systems don't have ANY logs related to SeBackupPrivilege. Anyone have any ideas on what might be happening? So far my searches have turned up nothing useful.
 For reference, in a 24 hour period, the unaffected systems generate about 76,000 Security Log events - whereas the affected system is about double that, and the extra 76,000 are all related to SeBackupPrivilege.
 I will not be able to provide any actual logs due to the company policy, but still hope someone has some ideas on what it could be.

We've tested this on some of our machines running the latest build, 16227.20280. Checking for updates through any of the apps, it will start to download an apply an update. Once this has completed, M365 is downgraded to the build that was released on March 20th, 16130.20332.
 We're able to manually update back to the latest build by using the C2R updater and referencing the build number: "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\OfficeC2RClient.exe" /update user updatetoversion=16.0.16227.20280
 Going through the GUI update process will again downgrade it to 16130.20332.
 Checking our registries, we can see that in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration, the "VersionToReport" key references the latest build. My assumption is that this entry is used when checking for updates.
 So, maybe some funny business at Microsoft's end this morning? Anybody else experiencing this?

 I'm goin to have to clean a lot of vlans from around 10 Cisco Catalyst switches with IOS-XE, and I'm wondering what would be the best way to do so, a bit of introduction, some of em are in RSTP domain but not all, some of em aren't declared in vlan db anymore but still on the "allowed trunk" list in interfaces. 
 I'd like to automate it as much as possible, and i was looking at ntc-templates, the main process should be 
  
I decide i need to eliminate vlan 333
 Find, hopefully with some kind of automation, every port where the vlan is explicitly allowed but not the trunk all ports
 "no vlan 333"
 "no spanning-tree vlan 333"
 for every interface found at point 2, do "switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 333" still, with some kind of automation
 
 I'm no expert with ansible, ntc-templates and so on, but I like to get shits done in the most efficient wave, and I'm willing to invest a bit of time in this cause for sure it'll spare a ton of time for me and my team in the future, so, what are your suggestions to do this kind of thing in the most efficient way?

 We have had very limited success on finding the cause, but the issue occurs several times a day, has anyone here dealt with this issue and have some idea of where to look.
 We have looked at the FW, but can't really see any relevant events.

 I do not have Administrator rights on my workstation.
 I have a situation where my main Adapter is split up to one Tagged adapter and one Untagged adapter.
 The Tagged adapter and Untagged adapter have IPv4 configurations.
 The main Adapter has IPv4/6 disabled. This is standard with the Intel PROSet configuration tool.
 Now the problem is when updates are pushed to this workstation, the two 'sub'Adapters (the tagged and untagged ones with ip config) dissapear and are deleted.
 The main adapter is working but has IPv4 configuration disabled. Thus logging in becomes impossible and I need to bother the Administrator.
 Windows 10 Enterprise.
 Enabling IPv4 is not allowed on the main adapter after the intel tooling created subadapter(s).

The router has Dhcp, NAT etc configured nothing major. However, what I tried recently was creating separate VRFs, one for the Customer and the second for the Management of the router. This was done to ensure to segregation of the routing tables of customer and management. 
 Now while deploying I was wondering, what are the pros and cons of creating VRFs in this scenario. What could be the possible downside of creating such a setup ? Appreciate your help and expertise, thanks in advance.

 Not really sure where else to post this. I did post this in r/networkautomation just now. 
 I've been going crazy the past few hours trying to fix this. I have a small EVE-NG environment running Cisco IOL and an Ubuntu box on my host machine. My goal is to start studying and writing Ansible playbooks for network automation.
 I CANNOT for the life of me SSH to my Cisco routers. At first it was giving me some Cipher key issues. Then a no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa error. I uncommented a bunch of lines and added some lines in my ~/.ssh/config file as well as my /etc/ssh/ssh_config and also an sshd file I believe (I don't fully recall as I did a bunch of stuff).
 Anyways, i'm at the point now when I try to SSH, I get an error in libcrypto error. I have removed my crypto keys and regenerated them. I had to generate them with a higher length as I was getting an invalid key length. All in all, I cannot SSH to these routers and I don't know why. I'm not the most Linux savvy but I will say I have no issues SSHing from my SecureCRT client on the same host machine. And telnet is a non-issue from my linux box either. It's solely SSH
 Any help would be appreciated because i'd like to move on with my studies and this all hinges on being able to SSH from this linux host box. 
 Thanks

I doubt it will be using close to 10Gig but if that's what they are paying for I don't want the router to be a bottleneck. Was originally looking at Cisco 4461 but even "performance license" aggregate throughput is only 3Gbps and "boost license" is 7 Gbps but only between built in 1Gbps interfaces. Would like to stay with Cisco but not a deal breaker as it's for a non-profit so don't want to break the bank. Also don't need anything fancy like SD-WAN but need 4 10Gbps interfaces.
 Does anyone have any experience with Cisco C8300-2N2S-4T2X? It has 2 10Gig ports and 2 NIM and 19Gigs of IPv4 forwarding throughput if not using SD-WAN.

 My question are to those who have gone through similar migrations and really looking for, generally speaking, how your job transformed from on prem to cloud - and what you did to prepare for it. What are some things you wish you knew? What would you do differently? Not from a technical aspect, more from an education and toolset aspect. Are there things that would have made the transition smoother... Not going to to say "easy" bc I'm not naive.. lol.

 We have a Arris E6000 running docsis 3.1 and sip with a global DQoS for the service flow. For some unknown reason whenever a call is made, immediately after the phone is hung up and the gate is closed the internet speed it throttled down to exactly 33Mbps. This last for. Early 9 minutes on the dot. It happens every single time. If the phone is left off the hook and the call is disconnected from the far end, the throttling does not occur. As soon as the receiver is hung up, the throttling occurs. 
 This happens on multiple versions of of the E6000 firmware, it happens on any modem running SIP, it happens on any speed config, it happens with a standalone sip service flow config (note the call does not use the sip service flow and instead still uses the DQoS), it happens with different modem configs. 
 It’s a head scratcher for sure.

 Let's say we got some firewall logs that shows some packet drops with source IP allocated to some disreputable ASN (A hosting provider for example)
 My question is in which point we can send mail to abuse contact and wait for reply
 If we don't get reply from ASN, can we contact with RIR from internet governance perspective?
 I hope this is not dumb question.

 A little bit of background: I graduated in 2019 with a BS in computer science, no certifications yet, and landed my first job in IT a couple of months later in k12 education at a middle school. I was the sole IT person there, so I was in charge of everything that plugged into the wall, from desktop support, to sysadmin duties in the mdf room, to inventory/asset management. Being my first IT job, I learned so much there but after about 2 years it quickly got old and felt plateaued. Also the school district's IT department started making things more and more centralized so I started losing permissions and access. 
 Anyway, I started interviewing for mainly sysadmin jobs in late 2022…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ziply Fiber seems to be one of latest ISPs to begin selling a 10G service tier via their FTTH network. My understanding is that these guys are using XGS-PON for their access network, and if this is correct, how the heck are they able to claim to offer 10G? At best with no congestion from neighbors sharing the OLT port, an XGS-PON user should only be able to get about 8.5 Gbps in either direction due to FEC and other overhead. I can't find anything anywhere talking about Ziply starting to deploy any flavor of 25G PON or active Ethernet, so what gives? Is this just another example of a company's Marketing department having no idea what they're talking about? I'd love to hear from any Ziply engineers if you guys are lurking here, particularly about which PON platform you've deployed.
 EDIT: Mystery solved. Ziply is in fact doing active Ethernet for their 10G tier (this is the transceiver they use). Kudos to them! It's not super scalable but if they have the spare fiber strands to burn, it is the cheapest, easiest, and most performant option for getting 10G to residential customers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm working on a GPON/XGS-PON deployment. Normally, we use PLC splitters, but a manufacturer proposed an FBT splitter so we can daisy chain our taps (ie: 10% of light going to the tap splitter, with 90% of the light going to the next tap). These particular FBTs are described to work in the full 1250-1650nm range, which is unlike anything I've read, but great if it works.
 I'm worried about temperature. Everything I'm reading says FBT splitters work from -5 to 75 Celcius, where PLC's can go down to -40 Celcius operating range. The buildout is in New England, so temperatures can definitely get down to -20 celsius. Does anyone have experience with this? Should I expect insertion losses over the FBT (like an additional half db of loss) or should I expect the FBT splitter to fail completely?
 Thanks ahead of time for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To begin with, I'm not a networking expert, in any mean. I have noticed this weird behaviour of our router at work (we do web services and have many workstations connected in LAN):
  
We've got fiber optics connection through a modem/router installed by our ISP. We can't ask for another model, we can't use anything else (they refuse to setup anything else).
 Whenever the modem/router is hit by simultaneous connections (usually when more than 10 computers are connected), it crashes. If only one computer is connected and is hitting the modem with simultaneous connections (let's say multi-threaded download), the modem crashes.
  
The actual workaround is that if we use a VPN, which means only one connection is created from each computer, there's no crash. However, using an external VPN limits our bandwidth.
 Is there anything we can set on the network to limit the simultaneous connections? At the moment, we're out of ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked with replacing our security camera NVR. We've currently got a 16 channel Hikvision unit that (while being a major step up from our old java-based D-Link DVRs) is a pain in the butt with it's requirements for proprietary video plugins and management software that demands local admin rights.
 Fortunately, we have contractual obligations with some of our customers that prevent us purchasing any additional Hikvision equipment (NDAA concerns), so our need to upgrade to a 32 channel unit gives me the perfect excuse to ditch Hikvision and our current NVR.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for an NVR that works with modern web standards, can be fully managed without specialized software (or at the very least uses software that's not stuck with Windows 98 security practices) and has basic motion-triggered recording features?
 Also, we have a number of cameras we don't want to replace just yet, so ONVIF compatibility is a must-have (though I imagine that's fairly standard at this point).
 EDIT: I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised by all the software-based recommendations. On the one-hand, it makes sense that a pure software solution would offer the best features and widest camera compatibility. On the other, I'm really disappointed at the idea that there's so few decent turn-key appliances out there.

 I've started receiving email alerts regarding Meraki MX blocking malicious software from 4.tlu.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com (maybe microsoft store). I think these are false positives, is anyone else getting this?
 ​
 **EDIT: I see "OneNote for Windows 10" was updated from Microsoft Store on one of the endpoints.
 **EDIT2: 4 years ago it was a false positive (3) False Positive From Meraki - Happy Friday! : sysadmin (reddit.com)
 **EDIT3: (POTENTIAL FALSE POSITIVE- They should have named their post better) Security Center False Positive Alert - April 13th 2023 - The Meraki Community
 **EDIT4: Per virus total

**EDIT5: Meraki Support susects this is a false positive according to FishyJoeJr below https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12krgh5/comment/jg3opht/
 **EDIT6: 8:57am Pacific: Per Security Center False Positive Alert - April 13th 2023 - The Meraki Community: Due to an internal configuration issue, Windows update traffic for Microsoft Edge is being incorrectly classified as malware by Meraki Advanced Malware Protection, and is being blocked. Meraki is aware of this issue, and is working to get this issue resolved. 
 **EDIT7: 9:27am Pacific: Per Security Center False Positive Alert - April 13th 2023 - The Meraki Community: The Windows update traffic is no longer being classified as a false positive on new lookups. It may take 1-2 hours for existing lookups to age out, after which time the lookup will be marked as clean. Alternatively, the MX can be rebooted to expedite resolution.

I am working with a device that has a built-in webserver and I want to setup a terminal in my lab for anyone that wants to work with it; so, we don't have to tie up a computer for just a web browser. I can ping my server, but I cannot get this stupid zero client to actually access the device with firefox. the browser keeps defaulting to HTTPS and the device I am trying to access does not have an SSL certificate. I can access the about:config and I can modify ssl and secuirty settings, but they do not retain that state through a power cycle.
 I also cannot for the life of me, figure out how to install any of the add-ons I downloaded through Hp ThinUpdate; i have them on a USB and the USB is plugged into the zero client, but I can't get any further than that. 
 any thoughts? besides throw it away?

Needless to say, we're not making out clients pay that and taking our business elsewhere.
 We liked Cerberus because it's super easy to set up and use, nice UI, and just plain works. Wanting something similar that doesn't cost a grand a year just so we can have SFTP. Not interested in any script, CLI, Linux, or open source solutions for various reasons. I've seen some mentions of CrushFTP around here, still a good option and comparable to Cerberus?

 When I ask him questions, his answers are extremely unclear and badly expressed while he is not even talking about very technical stuff...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started with my company a few weeks ago, and apparently a week before I started management emailed to users that we would be removing .NET Core 2.1, 3.1, and 5 from everyone's machines on April 17. I just learned this last week when they put the task on me to figure out how to do it after Qualys reported these EOL .NET versions as vulnerabilities.
 I've looked into Microsoft's Uninstall Tool, but I'm seeing that versions that Visual Studio installed (such as .NET 3.1 SDK with Visual Studio Professional 2019) can ONLY be uninstalled through the Visual Installer to modify .NET. I've also tried looking into the WMIC command line and manually uninstalling in Programs & Apps, which both do not work for this.
 Am I at a loss or is there any actual way to remotely do what they are asking, such as with SCCM?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any Google Workspace admins in the crowd? 
 We shut off POP + IMAP access to email not too long ago, to stop that "backdoor" into downloading an entire corporate mailbox onto non-corporate devices. And things have been quiet; people have had to access their mailbox via gmail.com or a Gmail app since.
 Now we have a few (mouthy) users who want their desktop client back (Apple Mail for example). Security is reopening the review into how to make it work. But, I've been through this already and want to limit the rabbit hole we go down (for the 2nd time). 
 From what I can see, I can enable/disable IMAP on a group or OU basis in Google Admin. Further, I can limit the IMAP access to specific mail clients. But that is all. I can't, in any way, limit the IMAP to corporate-owned devices, or approved devices, anything like that. And Context Aware Access does not engage for IMAP in any way that I can see. I assume it's because you're not opening the specific Workspace apps themselves, you're just authenticating to establish the OAuth token.
 Am I missing something?

 What CMDB solutions have you guys come across in your line of work that have been on-prem hosted?

 F&Q (https://wasabi.com/paygo-pricing-faq/#free-egress-policy) says, 
  
For example, if you store 100 TB with Wasabi and download (egress) 100 TB or less within a monthly billing cycle, then your storage use case is a good fit for our policy. If your monthly downloads exceed 100 TB, then your use case is not a good fit. 
  
Suppose storing 50GB on the Pay-Go plan. I understand I'll be charged for 1TB (a minimum monthly charge associated with 1 TB of active storage). How about the egress regulation? Will I have up to 1TB egress capacity? Or, just 50GB? 
 The same question goes for another situation: storing 1.2TB and being charged for 2TB. Will be the egress capacity 2TB or 1.2TB?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just as title says, is there a way, except manually and changing all passwords, to migrate AD1 to a new AD1 using essentials?
 If we were doing standard just throw a new AD online, sync, then down original and replace.
 Essentials doesn't allow multiple ADs. Customer only has 15 users, doesn't use advanced services of standard, no need, never gonna have more than 20 users.
 One thought I had was run windows backup of system only stuff, place on USB drive during install. In theory it should pull system config and backup, users, etc?
 Will that work or any other ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 we're currently using AD RMS with M365 Apps for Enterprise. All is working fine but now we want to migrate to Azure RMS and thereafter to Azure Information Protection. Prior to mgirate any users, I tested with my own account and set a deny permission on the license.asmx file for my user for read and execute.
 After restarting Word, I did not see my AD RMS templates anymore, which is great because this is what I expected. But instead, it connected to Azure RMS and showed the "Restricted Access" and "Unrestricted Access" template, as well as previously configured Sensitivity Labels. I did not create a SRV record for redirection, therefore I'm also wondering why it did connect to Azure RMS.
 I reverted the permission change on the license.asmx file and included my user again to read the file. I can verify this by opening the URL in the browser. I also deleted the MSIP folder in %localdappdata% and removed everything from the registry, that points to <GUID.aadrm.com>. Office is still connecting everytime to Azure RMS instead of my internal AD RMS server. I have an existing SCP, but this seems to be ignored now and I cannot get it back working to use AD RMS.
 Any advise?

We currently have around 50 vessels that are essentially floating mini offices and each having their own network on board. We are using Peplink routers as it can use cellular network to provide internet whilst out at sea (hopefully moving to Starlink for future endeavours, but thats another story lets just say awaiting on management). 
 I just wanted to know if there is anything out there that can monitor the network for each vessel remotely in one place. I would like it mainly to monitor bandwidth usage and traffic, similar to DPI. Unfortunately, only the higher end models of Peplinks have a DPI feature which we do not use.
 Any recommendations would greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope this is the right place to post. I have a homelab I want to implement some branding on the search highlights / search menu, which can be done using Azure AD (https://techb4.com/search-highlights-logo-customize-for-windows-10-11/).
 I wonder, since it is just the 'Search' app likely looking for files in a directory, or registry keys, can this be set by just putting the right files in the right place? I don't have an Azure AD machine to test this on or find the correct locations, however. It would be nice to create a GPO with these files so all my VMs can have consistent branding.
 Not sure how time consuming it would be to just create a new fresh vm, join it to a new free azure instance to test it myself. Like take a reg/files snapshot and then join, get the branding and take another reg/files snapshot and diff them.
 Since MS removed my option for branding (the 'System' control panel area) in the latest version of Windows I have to look for other areas!
 Anyone got any ideas, or is it just not possible without AAD?

 The latest march security update (Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016) is causing an issue with my IIS.
 As soon as I install it a new DLL gets added "sprequestfilteringmodule.dll" and the IIS becomes unreachable (503 error). What's interesting upon further investigation is that the WSUS Application Pool can't be started (no error message is shown, it just immediatly stopps again). The WAS Service is up and running though. In the Event Viewer, there are errors from the WAS Service with the Event ID 5002. A restart didn't help, the server had to be restored in order to get the IIS fast online again. More info to the server: It's a Windows 2012 R2 Server running SharePoint 2013 and the IIS. Has anyone encountered a similiar problem with the March Update or maybe even found a solution? Thanks already for reading and have a nice day

 I'm looking for some ideas on what to look for in regard to the below issue.
 The setup is 2 Nexus Switches with 4 vPC links going to 4 Isilon Appliances. (2 links per Appliance) Each interface on the Isilons have an IP address assigned and then the whole lot are in a cluster with Virtual IP.
 When all links are up I get packet loss to the Virtual IP. But if I shut down 1 redundant link per Isilon Appliance the packet loss goes away. 
 Has anyone seen this behaviour before? 
 MTU is set the same on both sides.

 I am in the process of removing our certificate authority server as we no longer need it.....then I remember years ago we configured AD to use LDAP over SSL. Running the LDP.exe I can connect to any DC over 636 or 389 so it makes me wonder about the overall security anyway.
 Just wondered how many of you are using LDAP without SSL? and has anyone purchased third party certificates for SSL? That might be something I can look into.
 Thanks!

 I was wondering if anyone uses this and if it's any good.
 Right now I do Windows updates and then either a Dell Command update or Lenovo Service Bridge update, but if it's possible to merge the process it saves me a good amount of time.

 I have been given the green light to implement cloud based printing in our business of around 300 users and 40 printers. I'm looking to go with Printer Logic as the print queue based licensing suits our needs better. 
 I'm just curious to know from anyone that has rolled this out what your procedure was? Currently have 2 print servers, one for each site. I want to do some initial testing first with a couple of printers before rolling out across the business. 
 We have around 10 GPOs relating to mapping printers for users (the guy before created a GPO for every different department instead of just using 1 GPO with item level targetting) Is it a matter of amending these GPOs to delete rather than create/update before pushing out the Printer Logic agent to the endpoints?
 Appreciate any advice
 Thank you

 It is widely reported on the internet and there are some workarrounds (replacing the MSTSCAX.DLL file or adding a reg key for the udp problem)
 In january there was a update that should have fixed this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/january-26-2023-kb5022360-os-build-22621-1194-preview-f6973dbe-bcc4-402a-8b9a-0541b0959403
 Unfortunatly this problem keeps coming back every month or so and im getting frustrated with the ammount of time me and my team have put in these work arrounds.
 The update is installed on all our customers computers but the problem came back today after a new update. 
 ​
 Does anyone here have a better way to deal with this problem than to manualy rename the MSTSCAX.DLL files and replacing them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Fellas :)
 I hope this is the correct flair, I was unsure if I should choose "Question" or "Microsoft"?
 I am currently having a problem with Microsoft Teams at one of our customers. It is a medium-sized company with about 30 employees.
 All employees work on a Windows Server 2019 terminal server and have a Microsoft 365 Business Basic license. Teams has the latest updates.
 At the beginning of the Corona Pandemic, the Teams-Free licenses were rolled out as a test. Everything has now been migrated to Microsoft 365 and the users have full licenses that also include the use of teams.
 Now the problem, which affects a part of the users, about a third: Teams ALWAYS logs in with the old "Free" account and does not recognize the assigned license. Logging out and back in manually doesn't help either. In the free account, an old database is listed up to the end of 2020, everything after that (since using the O365 licenses) seems to be in a kind of different profile that is not loaded.
 I have already reinstalled Teams, assigned / withdrawn the Teams Exploratory license from all users as a test and deleted the Teams cache under %appdata%/Microsoft/Teams.
 If the user logs into Teams via office.com, everything works as it should and the correct content and chats are displayed, the problem ONLY affects the local client.
 Do you have any idea? Some Teams-related things are just out of my understandings... Thanks!

I've also seen in their network infrastructure diagrams that they are also (but not only) running several 2650 and 2810 switches. It's not the focus of their request, but it got my attention.
 I've quickly checked their end of sale (both: 10y+) and the last time HPE/Aruba ever released software updates for the se switches (> 5y for one of them). These switches have Lifetime warranty and the clients' sysadmins is aware of that. In my experience HPE was also pretty OK with replacing defective units without much fuss. Yet without knowing the exact year they got purchased these 2 indicators would tell me that these switches are likely to have high runtime and should (really) be considered for replacement.
 While I've worked with HPE/Aruba switches it's not my daily business anymore (more in the system engineering field these days) thus I'm asking for an opinion.

 Usually I would not expose a database on the internet. I don't like that. It feels wrong to me.
 Am I too picky?
 What is the todays standard, to allow access to such a database?
 I have grafana running on the cluster. I could add a datasource and then the dude can build his panels and see the data. With 2fa, roles and permissions... but no Idea if I am thinking to complex.

 I am tasked with installing wifi in two buildings that are connected to the MDF via singlemode 9/125um fiber. The wifi will be broadcasting a public and private SSID on separate VLANs.
 Will any generic 9/125um SM LC SFP modules work with the indicated switch models, or are there compatibility issues among suppliers? Also do you foresee any VLAN tagging issues with this layout? I know I can do all this with fiber media converters and non-SFP switches, but I wanted to kill two birds with one stone, and cut out the converters and extra points of failure. Total length of both buildings together is approx 700ft.
 Note: there may be a MDF-IDF2 fiber run, but I won't know for sure until I talk to the cabler. The MDF fiber panels aren't labeled, so I didn't include the 2nd MDF fiber panel in the diagram. But if the MDF-IDF2 fiber run does exist, the design won't change much. Instead the 2nd SFP module will move to the MDF switch.

 What do you think the best practice is? 
 The purpose is to monitor the device and BGP session (downlink, device down, etc.) using Cisco Prime. 
 I can ping the router's public IP from the inside, but pinging from the public router to internal networks is a no-go.

 Current set-up is Modem > Router (handles DHCP & is default gateway) > NVR, Computers. I want to keep the router in here for Wi-Fi capability.
 Here is a picture of how I want to set this up: https://imgur.com/a/cRCLA8p "Modem > NGFW (X1 WAN port), NGFW (X3 port) > Router (Internet Port), Router (Ethernet Ports) > NVR, Computers" but when I seemingly plug it in, the end devices don't have internet.
 I'm wondering if I have to flush the IP addresses of all devices and set the default gateway to the NGFW? If so, how do I do that? If its easier, could I still let the router handle DHCP and give the NGFW an IP?
 Also the default IP for the X0 LAN port on the NGFW is 192.168.168.168. The IP range from the router is the usual 192.168.1.1-.254. In order to access the NGFW, do I have to set the X0 LAN port to something inside the router's range?

 So imagine you have an on prem AD, contoso.local, that doesn't really do much outside of PC login auth but you're quite attached to it. Then imagine you also have M365 in parallel, as contoso.com and it is in use for keeping track of M365 licenses, which is no biggie, but also for auth for some third party services, which becomes a massive PITA if it breaks. 
 Now picture a world where you want the two to work together. Now, if someone who gets paid a lot more than me hadn't gone in and just manually created accounts for everyone in 365 and had instead used aad connect it'd be pretty simple and my life would be easier. But that was not to be. I can't just do the needful, make a new upn suffix and have sync magically just work. 
 Can I map existing on prem AD users to 365 users with aadsync? And the PCs too, I guess, although while they[re there they're not really there, y'know? Ultimately, we're wanting to keep a couple AD servers on prem because it is just so dang easy to use (especially as an auth provider for a lot of internal stuff) but because everyone else is using cloud then we are too. Has anyone easily married the two without too much disruption (or work, because who wants to do more than they absolutely need to?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has a consultant who will be working remotely and in our office to review our sensitive company data at the request of our board of directors. My CFO asked that I connect and allow this person's computer to our corporate network, both in the office and for remote VPN work. I refused saying that was a tremendously bad idea of putting the company network at risk. I followed up saying we have plenty of spare laptops and I can issue him one in less than a few minutes, he dismissed this idea saying that this new IT stance was overreaching and controlling the business in ways he did not agree with.
 I've been in it for 22 years, I recognize that when I started a request like this would not have been given a second thought, however, with the way things are these days I only allow company managed computers to connect to our internal network. I've explained to the CFO that we have other consultants working for us who either have their own issued computers, or, are using cloud services to upload their work so that internal employees can review and save it as needed. His only argument for allowing a computer we do not manage to connect directly to our internal network is that it would be faster and more efficient for this consultant to do his work. My rebuttal is that while it is faster for him to do all of his work on a single computer it raises our risk by an incalculable amount that I do not think is worth considering.
 While I feel fairly secure in my response, and I have not relented one bit, his over the top response to this has me wondering what other professionals in the field feel about this situation.
 Thoughts? Am I the a-hole?

However, traffic initiated from gwith02 -> srv01 won't get there (by name). I have to do this numerically, through the br25 bridge. 
 I don't think this is a routing issue. Is there something I can do to the bridge to change this?

We only deal with the US company. Im a System Analyst and System Admin at my current role! This past month marks my 1yr and just had my review and was told i would get a raise as my performance was great. Fast forward to this month i was informed the company is cutting cost spent to much money in start up phase! And i would need to hold off. This is 2nd time to hold off. Said raise was supposed to have came at 6mths then again at a yr. No raise.
 Boss Today asked how we can save money and cut cost for company and IT dept. 
 So i turned in my notice. And saved the company 70,000 plus the lack of a raise they no longer have to lie about. .

 When i try to use 802.1x on a managed aruba switch thats connected to the access layer none of the port access requests make it to the clearpass server, i know radius is working because i can login to the switch with my radius credentials and my changes are showing up in clearpass.
 The port that the downstream switch is connected to does not have port access enabled, its just a regular port with all VLANs tagged as i would configure any normal trunk between 2 switches.
 Am i missing something here? can 802.1x wired authentication work across multiple switches?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, I've gone through various laptop docking station setups and it's been a frustrating experience. My Dell E6410 worked reliably with a proprietary dock, but my Dell XPS 13 with a Thunderbolt dock had endless issues with detection. Even after multiple driver downloads and fresh Windows installs, problems persisted with sound and monitor detection.
 I then switched to an HP EliteBook X360 with a USB C dock, which worked well until I hit limitations with monitor resolution. I replaced that with a Startech Thunderbolt 3 dock, which generally worked fine but occasionally required unplugging and replugging after sleep mode.
 Now, with my Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 5, I use a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock for Workstations. While I can remove my laptop from the dock without issue, returning it to the dock requires a hard reboot. And when the laptop goes to sleep, waking it up is often hit or miss, with only one screen coming up or no keyboard function.
 It's frustrating to deal with these issues, and I know I'm not alone - I constantly hear from my users with similar problems on their devices, including Microsoft Surface Laptops with both Surface Docks and universal docks. It's been over half a decade since USB C docks became the standard and there seems to be little improvement from manufacturers. Are the engineers at the manufacturers as frustrated as we are?
 All of my experiences have been with Win10 or 11, perhaps Microsoft is to blame.
 ​
 How are you handling these issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I'm new here.
 Our story begins with a switch stack, we'll call it switch 3. Switch 3 has been communicating with another switch called switch 50.
 Switch 3 and Switch 50 are using APs to talk to each other.
 switch 3 is configured as follows:
 interface TenGigabitEthernet2/0/47
 switchport trunk native vlan 10
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,100
 switchport mode trunk
 end
 and switch 50 is configured as follows:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport trunk native vlan 10
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,100
 switchport mode trunk
 ip dhcp snooping trust
 end
 interface Vlan1
 ip address 172.X.X.Z *netmask*
 !
 interface Vlan10
 ip address 10.X.X.Y *netmask*
 the meat of the story is that things in the IP subnet of VLAN 10 can communicate back and forth between the network. an example would be switch 3 pinging an IP in the VLAN 10 range (10.X.X.Y) that lives on switch 50. But when I try to ping an IP in the VLAN 1 range (Yes, I know, I inherited this network) there is no response. I will provide an example below:
 SW-003#ping 10.X.X.Y
 Type escape sequence to abort.
 Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.X.X.Y, timeout is 2 seconds:
 .!!!!
 Success rate is 80 percent (4/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 2/21/43 ms
 but when I ping switch 50 using the VLAN 1 range it shows below
 SW-003#ping 172.X.X.Z
 Type escape sequence to abort.
 Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.X.X.Z, timeout is 2 seconds:
 .....
 Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)
 I know this is a whole bunch of Cisco, but I'm unsure if this is a Ruckus AP\WiFi issue or if I am missing a crucial bit of configuration on the Cisco side.
 ​
 I am re-posting this in other subreddits for visibility and insight.

 I have a Synology 802.11ac router with roughly 60 devices connected. Guest network is turned on.
 About a month ago, devices in the main network started to not have internet connection unless I assigned a static IP. I don't understand why but this has just been the case. Almost every device in the warehouse is now on a static IP. The guest network however is able to assign an IP naturally and the devices work without static IPs with no issue.
 That all being said, I have an alarm.com svr and cameras that I had to connect to the guest network to get them functioning at all which is not what I want. The svr is plugged in via ethernet (it has to be) which tries to connect it to the main network. I cannot assign an IP to the svr in the app which leaves me with a dead camera system since it cant connect to the internet.
 I'm kind of just stuck and would like to figure out how I can get the main network DHCP server to assign good IPs again and get my camera system working.
 Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me solve this!!!

 I know that the wol itself is a broadcast packet and the goal is if someone is VPN ing from outside then they should be able to login to the PCs even if they are turned off.
 I found this online is this something that can be done or am I looking at the wrong thing here? It's from 2011.

 They are using a router here but instead of the router can this be done on the access switch(the static arp entry)?
 Otherwise this is the traffic flow for VPN traffic from outside
 Outside (from users PC from home or wherever) - outside ASR router - Palo firewall - nexus 7k - access switch - then the desktops

 We use Cacti to monitor most stuff on our network but I am not sure how to monitor BGP route changes. Like how do I know if the internet switched from primary to secondary isp.
 We use uptime robot to monitor network from outside because it pings the ISP IPs. But is there is a better way than to just ping the interface? When I google all I see is products that sells monitoring. If you can point me to any resources that would be great!

So I'm thinking, that doesn't make sense, it's the same network. If he couldn't pick up an IP I'd see that as a problem with DHCP for sure, but once he's got one, not sure it matters. He insist when he sets his laptop to a static IP, it works fine, but when on DHCP, no luck. His static settings match what our DHCP hands out (subnet mask, dns, gateway, etc.) Any thoughts on why only this computer, not on our domain, would connect when on static and not DHCP.

 I've been trying to setup Oxidized as a replacement for our old RANCID configuration and was wondering how this would work with Aruba switches and PFSense firewalls.
 I know oxidized works with the older HP Procurves but I can't find any examples of it working with Aruba. I know that there is a model: procurve tag for oxidized but would that be the same for Aruba?
 Also, if anyone has gotten this to work with PFSense and would be willing to share their config and router.db file, I would appreciate it greatly.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since I was admitted, 2 years ago, coworkers complained about the state of the archive room and how it would be cool if someone, somehow, put everything online, making it easy for all of us to access stuff in it.
 There's no way one can just put the archive online while continuing to create files on paper. So I told the President we needed software that provided all the functions for the relevant departments, and managed to find an open-source and well supported software for that.
 I presented it to the relevant sectors of the company and they basically didn't like it, saying it would be "too difficult" to adjust to using it. I tried again, and they said the application sucks without even so much as touching it. Talked to the President and he insisted we must use it. Scheduled training this morning, no one showed up.
 I'm not sure what these people want to be honest. No way I'm going to be responsible for operating the software too, it's not even my function, I just provided them the software. They dead-on said they didn't like it and want to go back to the way it was before, i.e. doing everything on paper. I even mentioned a search in the archive can be done in less than a minute now thanks to the software and they couldn't be pissed.
 How do you guys manage to convince coworkers? Or should I just say fuck it and let them have it their way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone confirm how thousandeyes pricing model works? Cisco seems to be clueless. 
 Say if we have 100 branch offices or remote sites. At each branch office, we have a core router/firewall, core switch, lots of poe switches, and access points. My understanding is we would need 1 enterprise agent at each site to monitor these network devices at the site via SNMP. Do they charge per each Enterprise Agent, or per each network device (router, switch, ap) monitored? They call these network devices Device-Layer Devices https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/device-layer/discovering-device-layer-devices
 We would then have probably one employee at each site that would have the endpoint agent installed on their laptop. We would like to run bandwidth speed test, confirm dns and basic internet connectivity is working to all cloud applications hosted on the internet. I would hope it would take into account the wifi connectivity from the laptop to the ap, the connectivity from the ap to switch, switch to router, router to ISP, and ISP to cloud application? How is this priced?
 Are we looking at 100 enterprise agents and 100 endpoint agents? 
 Can Thousandeyes replace a traditional NMS for SNMP polling and up/down ICMP pinging? Does it provide netflow, syslog ingestion, and BGP monitoring?

We bought the StarTech.com Serial DB9 RS232 Extender extender (part RS232EXTC1), which has female serial connections on both adapters. We used the gender changer adapter that came with it in order to connect the blue Cisco serial console cable to the powered adapter.
 We're not able to connect to the switch via serial, even with both adapters powered. I'm wondering if anyone has done this before, and if serial extenders are compatible with Cisco switches.
 Perhaps the powered adapters aren't necessary, perhaps the gender changer is a null modem, or perhaps the switch isn't compatible with serial extenders. I'm hoping that someone smarter than us knows a simpler way to do this (it must remain serial and cannot be network/IP-based management). Our Internet searches are not coming up with much.

 Which is not valid. It should be

 Here is basic example

 I did not see with certainty in the switch config that it's OS6, but I do see on https://www.netsolutionworks.com/Networking-Switches/N2000-Series/N2048P.asp
 It says that all N Series switches include Dell NOS6.. For giggles I tried other Dell OS modules but none had better result. Any thoughts?

 Everything else on the wifi seems to work but Whatsapp doesn’t connect. Its not really a big problem as i think im the only one using it once a week. But im sure someone will complain eventually. 
 Any ideas my current thought is maybe whatsapp has an IPV6 requirement now but not sure.

 Mainly, I want to create a keypair for a single developer. Any server he/she needs access to, I can add their account and public key file to the server. No creds to share or store. Easy to do for one server, but what if I am setting up multiple servers for this developer? I'm dreading the thought of having keypairs per account per server.

 We use Edge as the default browser across our org of <1000 machines and have a number of Policies set in Group Policy to standardize the experience. Nothing too crazy, just some default favorites, setting the new tab page, and a few others.
 The issue is that we've found a large and seemingly random amount of computers aren't applying ALL the policies. Most will apply. If you check the registry, every policy key is there. But Edge doesn't show them under Edge://Policy
 It doesn't matter the version of Edge, updating makes no difference. OS version makes no difference. The ADMX templates are updated as of yesterday. The machines affected are seemingly random.
 The policies were set in our Default Domain Policy (I didn't love using that), so I copied every setting and placed in a new GPO and applied to just the computers OU. Confirmed with GPOresult -r they are receiving it (and the registry keys are there under HKLM/Software/Policies/Microsoft/Edge) No change. 
 What is so weird is MOST of the policies show up in Edge, with only a few totally missing. But even some that are listed in Edge, are not actually working. Like the Home Page URL. How could that just not work?
 Has anyone encountered this before? It is making me feel crazy.

 Are there alternative methods to protect the private keys on an always running Windows Enterprise CA such as just locking down access to it in a certain way that allows it to function issuing certificates for autoenrollment to users and devices, but still keeping the private key protected from compromise.

With AI technology this is quickly becoming a potential issue, but also generally speaking if a person is locked out of their account we can't do a video call. 
 That being said we use Microsoft Authenticator for our users as a general MFA tool. I was hoping there was a way to send a push notification through Azure, but I can't find anything.

 I just started using some opengear hardware. We have a lighthouse server behind a firewall, that cannot be reached by our opengear console switches when they are using their fallback cellular connection. My setup is using the "Auto-Response" that checks if the Ethernet connection can reach the lighthouse server. If that fails it turns on the cellular connection and the OpenVPN connection towards our OpenVPN server and here comes my issue. The OpenVPN connection establishes for a second before going down and then it just loops going up and down etc. I can see the following in "/var/log/messages"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 ​
 I'm not sure if I'm in the right sub, if not, sorry :)
 ​
 I work at a MSP which offers IaaS and SaaS services.
 Currently we are on a pure Juniper infrastructure in terms of firewall and switches. 
 However, after certain devices go EOL and the maintenance renewal is pending for others, we are asking ourselves whether Juniper is still the right choice, since the maintenance fees alone are very high.
 ​
 To give a bit of an idea of what size range we are in:
 2 hardware firewalls:
 - Mainly L4 Statefull firewall for 12 security zones with a total of about 100 VLANs as gateway.
 - 10 Site2Site VPNs
 ​
 6 switches with the following connections (not counting uplinks)
 56 x 10 GBe
 44 x 1GBe
 20x 40GBe
 6 x 100GBe
 ​
 So not a lot, but a bit of something, which is probably what we are counting with most manufacturers in the campus segment.
 ​
 We are currently considering FortiGate for the firewall and Mellanox for the switches. At the same time, I came across FortiSwitches, which I have no experience with. Does anyone have a comparable setup and recommendations regarding function and economy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I work at a place where all our internal tools are installed in an old (but not so bad) way. The typical infra for an app is two servers with redundancy (keepalived, HeartBeat...).
 This means one tool = at least 2 servers + some networking and one small team for maintenance (often 1-3 people). 
 For the context, we don't do cloud providers (sensitive data) and we don't have to handle a lot of traffic load (internal tools only).
 When I arrived I suggested to "centralize" this as more and more apps were also shipped containerized. So with my team we set up a Kubernetes infra which work very well, and with few servers we are able to host like 10 internal tools.
 My points are : this brings same maintenance for all the apps (common k8s dashboard, procedures...), same backups and disaster recovery system, better security management etc. (I won't teach you all of this I think ^^) 
 But the thing is : before all of this, there was very few service interruptions, and when it happened it had impact on one tools only. The k8s infra is simpler and more powerful, we had no interruption in one year. Last week, we had a stupid issue with a certificate in the CNI that interrupted all the cluster for one day (the k8s expert were not on site this day). 
 This event created a bit of a debate about migrating legacy apps to k8s, am I still on the right path ? How to reassure the old sysadmins ? I'm still thinking that k8s simplifies a lot our work

Switches send dot1x to Clearpass RADIUS which in turn returns a secure vlan tag for the switch. No certificate means the device either get some other know device category or rejected into a guest vlan. Easy.
 Same goes for wireless: workstation sends it's certificate towards SSID secure-ad-xyz, which authenticates towards Clearpass as RADIUS. Clearpass only sets access allowed/denied.
 So a seperate SSID per purpose. My question: can Aerohive APs/SSID's broadcast dynamic vlans on 1 SSID...? Depending the presented certificate a certain vlan tag? 
 Defining a RADIUS server is easy enough and obvious to find. But I cannot seem to find any documentation on AAA or dot1x portcontrol or how to setup dynamic/<any NAC>/Clearpass-returned tunnel-private-group-id ..?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello-
 I am setting up my first ERSPAN configs on my nexus 9k switches. I need 2 separate monitors each sent via a different I address. I followed along with a guide and came up with the following for the first:
 NX-01(config)# monitor session 10 type erspan-source
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# erspan-id 20
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# vrf default
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# destination ip 2.2.2.2
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# source interface ethernet e1/2 both
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# no shut
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# exit
 NX-01(config)# monitor erspan origin ip-address 1.1.1.1 global
 Then on the second I have a different destination ip and different source interface obviously, but I want that monitor to out via 1.1.2.1 and I am guessing the "global" command i used above makes all ERSPAN go out the 1.1.1.1 address? How would I change it so that "erpsan-id 20" goes out 1.1.1.1 and "erspan-id 30" goes out 1.1.2.1?
 Thanks!

 Currently got an issue and which I’m unable to find a solution to myself. Was hoping some one here could point me in the right direction..

The application requires the roles “Reports Reader” and “Cloud application administrator”. Currently trying to investigate if it is possible to restrict the scope of permissions for these roles for the application. The other companies are worried about the “Reports Reader” role since this role can access sensitive data from the other companies as well. 
 Is there anyway to install this enterprise application in the tenant without giving the app permission to read the other companies “sign-in data” and other sensitive information?

 I've read this: Manage access to private store (Windows 10) | Microsoft Learn but it looks like this applies the windows store for business, can anyone confirm?
 Would love to hear how people are managing this if at all,

Domain admin account which we use only on our servers and don't touch endpoints with them.

 But this feauture is keeping me really busy these days.
 People lost their signatures. wel they are not lost but they are under the catagory "signatures on this computer" and can't be applied automatically to the newly writen or reply mails. 
 So that sucks, cause a lot of people have more than 1 account signed in their outlook using the same signature.
 When i uncheck the box for cloud save, it still synced signatures from other personel that are using the same mail adresses. 
 Is it just me or is this feauture not thought through properly? 
 Why not make the local signatues also available for being assigned automatically? 
 Does anyone has a faster solution other then copying the signatures again to every mail adres the customer uses?
 Like how to disable this entirely before a sync even happens?

 Some of our customers want to test our software before installing it in their productive environment, since it's rather complicated to install and needs a server.
 We'd like to provide virtual machines to our customers with our software on there for them to test.
 Does anyone have experience setting up something like this?
 My current plan is to get a somewhat decent PC to act as a Server for virtualization since server hardware is super pricey.
 Then I'd either get a Windows Server License and create Virtual Machines for each customer using HyperV
 OR
 I would install Proxmox and buy multiple Win10 Pro licenses to create a virtual machine for every customer. 
 Are there better ways for that? Is it even allowed to provide our customer with a fully installed Windows 10 Pro with our software on it?
 Cloud (AWS, Azure etc.) is unfortunately not an option.
 I feel like there are better ways for doing what I have planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Looking to get some input from the hive mind...
 MSA 1050 with SAS connection to 2 Hyper-V nodes. Inherited the current configuration with 6 1.8TB SAS disks in RAID 6. this should theoretically give me around 7.2TB of useable storage.
 Additional array of 4 x 2.4TB disks installed in RAID 5 again theoretical useable of 7.2 TB.
 All that's working as expected the disk groups state size as 7192 GB in both instances, however, in windows after mapping the volumes they're showing as 6.54 TB in both instances.
 The first array (RAID 6 1.8TB disks) is nearly full hence installing new array to archive some data off, however, looking at the SAN management interface there's apparently a TB of unallocated storage. Pool B has nothing moved onto it yet so I assume that's why it's reporting as virtually empty.
 I've read through the supporting documentation and followed to the letter with creating the disk group and volume. I haven't been able to find anyone else with this problem, which makes me think it's just the way it is, but seems odd.
 Has anyone come across this before? I'm not overly familiar with HP SANs or SAS connections to them.
 Thanks in advance!

 There is a lot of documentation available, but it's quite verbose and I can imagine that it is hard for someone new to find specific information without a lot of reading. I would therefore like to provide an extra set of documents to my successor that contains the most important things to help get him/her started quickly and smoothly.
 Given you would be my successor, what information would help you most to find your way around as the new system administrator? What would be the most important things to have at hand when there is nobody around to ask?

 This is not about the NAS config tho, but about the backup.
 Would you choose backups to 2-3 external 12TB hard drives or some cloud backup solution to our Azure plan. Upload speed at that office is about 200Mbit/s.

 Currently I work at a MSP as networking/infrastructure engineer and I'm getting to the point of burnt out. Currently my MSP supports small business and 99% of our clients run horrible EOL devices that have countless security issues and lists of other issues. Sadly my MSP is undergoing changes from a buyout and other issues, so our focus is currently on just band aid fixing 99% of these platforms and not properly upgrading or find long term solutions. This is only the start of the list of things wrong with my MSP, I've come to the conclusion I'll officially be moving on. I used to work for the CA government and while it was not perfect by had a lot of advantages compared to my current position.
 I wanted to get feedback from everyone on the best types of companies to work for. I understand there are great fortune 500 companies like Netflix, Linkedin etc. However I wanted to see if anyone had from personal experience a field that generally has a good IT backbone. For example I've been looking into banks or hospitals since both will more then likely have a huge security presence and more then likely a proper set of policies and procedures.

 I have been trying to get iDRAC up and running recently, but it has been driving me crazy and would love a little help if any one could!
 ​
 A bit of background:
 I have have an old Dell PowerEdge C2100 I have had for a little over two years. I have never updated the BIOS or iDRAC firmware since I have had it, as I thought that they were probably close to latest possible version being as old as it is. I now have run into an issue with iDRAC as it has become so old no web browser (even internet explorer) wants to interact with it with the exception of my IOS devices (I assume safari is very leanient on older TLS protocols when accepting the risk of an invalid cert). After some research I found a reddit post (I can't find it but if I do i'll link it here) about how they bricked theirs by not first updating to 1.65.66 and now iDRAC doesn't work anymore. I then stumble across another couple posts mentioning that there are at least 4-5 stepped firmware upgrades you must do in order but no one mentions them. I have searched through Dell's site for a couple days now and can only find BIOS firmware and some client exes on the official Dell PowerEdge C2100 downloads page.
 ​
 I guess my questions are, where can I find resources on what major versions I must update to and where can I find the update files for iDRAC? I have heard of a bootable Update ISO that helps get the required updates from the Dell Repository, is that supported for C2100s (I can't find any trace of it).
 ​
 I really appreciate any help, thanks guys!

 We don't need much storage. 2TB would be ok. But the difference between buying 3 HDD or 3 SSD is around $700.

 Is there anyway to force IPSec for routine Certificate checking , so that in case the CA certificates at the client is revoked, deleted or expired for some reason , the IPSec tunnel will go down ?.
 Let me know what do you think.
 Thanks in advance.

 So last week we changed the domain we were using as a vpn endpoint… was a red tape thing after being acquired… We were told to add “vpn.domain.com” to our existing domain… Anyways the change went well… or so we thought.
 About 12 hours after the change about 90% of people could connect… Of the 10% that couldn’t we realized they ALL had Spectrum at home. No one had issues with Comcast or ATT.
 Now, we have two guys on a business trip to do some maintenance on our servers at an out of state colo. They too are also unable to connect and are receiving the same error message “Cant connect to the specified secure gateway.”
 My manager says its because we don’t have ‘DMARC’ set up for this new domain… Everything I’ve read on DMARC seems highly specific to email so I’m very confused how this would be relevant…
 Without going down a rabbit hole – does anything jump out here that I should check? Not trying to waste anyones time… just curious if this is something obvious that I’m oblivious to.

Thankfully the message and its Trojan PDF was blocked by MS Defender as Trojan_PDF_QakAdobeLureZip_A.
 I have seen a few of these, including one thread that was stolen from a major corporation that had nothing to do with us (probably a mistake in the phishing scripts).
 Is the consensus that these were mined from phishing victims who gave out their email credentials and then the bad actors put a forwarding rule to capture the emails?
 How might you go about informing the original sender whose email I believe was hacked? I feel a sort of duty to do so, but these emails were from seven months ago. Any evidence might be long gone.

I'm going to preface this post by saying I have never had hands-on experience with an Enterprise MPLS network or the process of ordering such a service. That being the case, there is a ton of information out there about MPLS and how it works, how you configure it within devices, etc. But one thing I can't seem to find is any information about the underlying Layer-1 transport for MPLS. I'm aware that MPLS doesn't really care if it travels across UTP cables or Optical links but what I'm wondering is this; For those of you who have actually installed MPLS circuits what type of Layer-1 connectivity have you used? If optical, what kind of optical (DWDM? Something else?) and how was that optical fiber provided to your company? If copper, did it use RJ45 connectors? Something else? Just trying to get a feel for how MPLS is physically provided to a company. Thanks!

So, my ask, is have you ever gotten a price cap negotiated with Arista before?

 We would like to announce that we have decided to disallow all posts and comments that use prompts generated by ChatGPT or similar large language models.
 The core of the matter is the fact that ChatGPT is not a source is truth, it's a word projection model. It can munge words together to create a seemingly impressive answer, but cannot definitively tell you how it arrived at its answer. While sometimes it can provide some sources for the answers - unless the dataset is constantly refreshed - the links to its sources may be broken/no longer work.

 My account rep has responded with the same stats that were linked in that thread. 
 Here is what was sent to me:
  
Regarding the presence of Fortinet Fortigate VPN our recommendation remains the same to explore ZTNA solutions. Cisco, llumio, Palo Alto, ZScaler, and Perimeter81 are some ZTNA options we recommend. 
 Using incident data and internal "insert insurance company name" claims data, we identify the propensity of cyber incidents based on company size (revenue), industry, and VPN Solution in place. An interesting stat that came out of our analysis was organizations using this VPN solution (Fortinet Fortigate) are 3x more likely to have a security incident. In other words, "insert insurance company name" predictive risk model has observed more instances of ransomware attacks at organizations utilizing this VPN solution. 
  
We are having internal talks now to decide what to do, but moving providers is one of them. I understand that ZTNA is better, but what I perceive as our threat model doesn't warrant me going that far.
 If anyone has thoughts or ideas of what to do, I will gladly take them into consideration.

Many of our customers are using and are very familiar with the older product known as Microsoft LAPS. I am very happy to say that we are delivering today a worthy (IMO) successor in Windows LAPS. Please see By popular demand: Windows LAPS available now! for more details.
 Teaser: many of you are eagerly awaiting the public preview announcement for the Azure Active Directory scenario – we’re not quite there - sorry - but it will be coming this quarter! 
 So how do you get the bits? Feel free to just run Windows Update of course, however the following doc topic will be updated later today with links to the specific KB update articles:
 Windows LAPS supported platforms and Azure AD LAPS preview status
 And for those that are might ask: yes the feature bits are available on Windows 10 today as well! :-)
 thanks,

 This should be of interest to many here: 
 "Welcome to the new and improved Windows LAPS! That's Local Administrator Password Solution. We've been listening to your feedback and requests, and the day is finally here for both cloud and on-premises environments.
 We're very happy to announce that new LAPS capabilities are coming directly to your devices starting with today's April 11, 2023 security update for the following Windows editions:
  
Windows 11 Pro, EDU, and Enterprise
 
Windows 10 Pro, EDU, and Enterprise
 
Windows Server 2022 and Windows Server Core 2022
 
Windows Server 2019 "
 
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/by-popular-demand-windows-laps-available-now/ba-p/3788747
 There are some cool new features for on-prem though
  
Password encryption: Greatly improves security for these sensitive secrets!
 
Password history: Gives you the ability to log back into restored backup images.
 
Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password backups: Helps keep your domain controllers secure by rotating these critical recovery passwords on a regular basis!
 
Emulation mode: Useful if you want to continue using the older LAPS policy settings and tools while preparing to migrate to the new features!
 
Automatic rotation: Automatically rotate the password after the account is used.

From what I can tell so far, the PowerShell script makes a legit-looking Windows message box pop up on your screen, telling you to call a toll-free number. Dial the number and you are cheerfully greeted by a foreign call center that will be more than happy to help you resolve all your issues. You know how it works from there ...
 All jokes aside about logmein - the fact that this URL has been around for about 10 years and organically pops up in Google search is disturbing.
 Who the hell would type a dash in the URL? No one. That's not how they get you. Because the address bar in your browser is also a search box, many people tend to type in the name of a website, and then click on the website URL in the search results. (Call it lazy or dumb or genius, but I can't tell you how many times I watch people type 'youtube' and press Enter, only to then click on youtube.com in the search results). So when you type 'log me in 123' into the browser bar and press enter, you'll see this malicious site prominently displayed on the FIRST PAGE of google.

I would just want something where I can select my intended use (home, enterprise, etc.), the number of ports, the features I need (PoE, VLAN, etc.), and it would suggest me be the best pick. At the very least, having a usable filter to reduce the sample size would be much more intuitive.

 Any idea if radius user attributes have changed? After upgrade my Vasco account was using network operator and was using network admin before.
 I can create read and write access group profile for network operator but I have feeling user profile attributes have changed so I need to really make the change at the radius server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I work for a public library, and we've got issues with our staff printer. It's connected to our network, so all of us on the staff wifi connection are able to print to it. The printer is a Toshiba eStudio3015ac, if that helps.
 ​
 The problem we're encountering is randomly, sometimes a couple times a day, sometimes weeks apart, we'll get a random print job come through that none of us sent. It'll be 100+ pages with random letters/numbers/symbols on the first page, tons of blank pages, then a random symbol/letter/number on a page.
 ​
 Our network security company wants us to call them when a print happens so they can check the packet (I'm thinking is what they said? I'm a tech guy but networking-wise I'm clueless) and see where it's coming from. Our copy company is stumped as to what's causing it--they thought it was a faulty print driver, but we've replaced them on all staff laptops and it's still causing issues.
 ​
 We've downloaded Wireshark to try and monitor the traffic, but I'm having no luck figuring out how, exactly, to monitor incoming prints on the network printer. Any ideas?

 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.

 Looking for some recommendations for setting up a wireless bridge between a building and a field press box. Line of sight is clear and shy of 100m. Unfortunately trenching is not an option.
 I have a couple of NanoStation M2 however, the needs will include video streaming and spectator wifi. Goal is is to add a small switch in the press box and an outdoor AP in the stands. Afraid the NanoStations would not be sufficient.
 Was looking ideally at something that would work in the 60ghz with 5ghz failover and could give me approx gigabit duplex.
 Found MikroTik "wireless wire" for about $200 which is the first time I hear of them, but is there anything similar in price and management that can be done with Unify? The "building to building bridge" is $500 and seems to need some sort of management console (I think it can run in a VM so plausible). Any decent known solutions under $500 total?

 I have been searching all over the web, Microsoft and Reddit and I can't seem to find the answer to this issue...
 I have a client that requested O365 email encryption. I set them up with a E3 license to do so. When they first went to send encrypted emails, Outlook said that Information Protection was not enabled on their tenant. I used Powershell to enable and now they can send out encrypted emails.
 The issue is, instead of the email arriving where they can open it in a browser with a code... they get an email that requires the Information protection viewer and a Microsoft account.
 This is obviously to much for most recipients to be able to handle (I know... trust me... I know...).
 Here is the thing, when I send an encrypted email out of our organization it arrives in the code/web format. However, when my client sends it... it's always a .rpmsg and requires the viewer to open.
 Does anyone know what I need to change to make it use the code/web version?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a request from our security folks to look into disabling HTTPS access on the spines and leaves in our ACI environment if we don't use it. To the best of my knowledge, we don't use the object store browser on the leaves themselves, we really only use the web interface on the APICs. I reached out to TAC and they recommended creating a new set of contracts and EPGs for in-band and out-of-band, applying a filter to block HTTPS to the contracts, and adding the leaves and spines to those new EPGs for in-band and out of band.
 I went ahead and built this and moved some leaves into the new EPGs, and the block works for out-of-band (e.g. I can nc -zv <leaf_OOB_address> 443 and get no response), but not in-band, and it's not clear why. Initially my thought was to set the filter to block 443 as a source port and add the contract as a provided contract, which seems to be what works for the OOB port. On the in-band EPG, I did the same thing, adding a filter for source port 443 > any and setting my new contract as a provided contract. That did not work, so I've since tried adding a filter for any > dest port 443, changing it to a consumed contract instead of provided, etc. I've opened up a TAC case, but they took a look at what I had configured and said it seemed right, so they're waiting on feedback from a higher level engineer to see if there's something additional needed.
 Does it sound like there's something I'm missing?

 I should first start off saying that I have no real knowledge or experience with networking. I’m an investigator trying to solve a problem here so I appreciate any simplistic answers.
 Essentially a client was extorted online through social media in which I have confirmed their IP addresses as of October 10, 2022 as:
 197.210.76.195
 197.210.76.208
 Both are Nigerian
 Through further investigation I found a suspect who logged into social media also on October 10, 2022 using the IP address of 197.210.76.99.
 What are the odds they are the same person?
 I have found similar connections in which the xxx.xxx.xxx have all matched but the last numbers were different, however they were generally a day or two apart. The above are the only IP addresses in which occurred on the same date.
 I appreciate any help on this!
 Thank you so much for the time.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking to get the 365 Enterprise Admin Expert certificate but aware MS100/101 will be going into MS102 in a few months.
 1) Will the pre requisites change also for the Enterprise Admin? Or will they likely stay the same? I just want to get one of them ticked off so I can crack on with MS102 when it comes out in May.
 2) In prep for MS102 should I just read through 100/101 for now or will it change up quite a lot do we reckon? Not followed exam certs before so in the dark.

 I want to be able to discover unwanted/new network devices via my monitoring tool (SNMP) . I could alert myself when a physical interface goes up or something. But I don't necessarily want to know if some random colleague plugged in a Laptop in their port. 
 I -do- want to know if somebody is plugging in a network switch or router. Regardless of the vendor. 
 Does there exists SNMP MIB's for Cisco (Catalyst) or tooling or a trick for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, I read David Allen's "Getting Things Done" and his time management method clicked with me. It was pretty tool agnostic, and served me well for a number of years. Though I learned I needed to CYA more than most people would by archiving more stuff than most people would. I used a modified version of it for years with a decent amount of success with only a minimal of stuff falling through the cracks.
 I looked at a few other systems, such as Pomodoro, and one other one I can't recall.
 Last night, I started reading "Getting Results the Agile Way" written by J.D. Meier, who works at Microsoft. Many people praised it as an excellent time management strategy, and either a good replacement for GTD or a nice complement to GTD. I don't want to get too deep in the weeds on this, but a lot of his guiding principals just DO NOT work for me. His methodology is not about Agile project management, it's more about being agile in how you manage your work.
 At work, we're HEAVILY focused on implementing Agile. For my day-to-day work, it's been a COMPLETE AND UTTER failure. For all my project work, it's also been an utter disaster, mostly because I don't work on any custom development projects. It's all infrastructure upgrade stuff and COTS upgrades.
 I can obviously continue to use my hybrid method. But I'm curious if anyone is following a time management system that helps organize the insanity.

Aside from that, I am trying to understand how a wildcard certificate works. I have added SSL certificates in the past, but the wildcard piece I don't quite understand. 
 Once I purchase the wildcard certificate, I need a CSR. Does that CSR come from the first application I am needing my SSL certificate for? I read somewhere that I need to first add the wildcard certificate to my ADCS server first and that is where I get my CSR using IIS. This part confuses me. 
 In the future, when I need a new SSL certificate for a different application, do I log in to NS and create another wildcard certificate with a subdomain? Or do I use *.domain.com every time? I feel like if I create a new one, it will remove the previous CSR I submitted and break that application. Again, this part confuses me as well.
 I would appreciate a quick explanation of how this works. Bonus points if you have used NS before, as bad as they are.

 As part of our build hardning process, we are looking at enabling SMB signing across our laptop and desktop estate, and then eventually server estate. We are already at 80% CIS L2 compliance but this is a big sticking point for us.
 We have legacy servers. Its the ussal stuff every org has, ancient 2003 / 2008 servers running mission critical agents, databases etc. 
 I am just wanting to make sure that there werent any major gotcha's when it comes to enabling SMB singing, specifically when it comes to sysvol access. We have some legacy DCs running 2008r2 to allow our legacy xpe thin clients to communicate and want to make sure enabling it wont impact us.
 MS docs arent very helpful for this. Decomm of legacy kit is in the pipeline and is being worked on but we could do wiht some advise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there!
 I'm stuck on a problem that I feel shouldn't be so hard to crack, but I can't find a good solution for it.
 I was handed a users Windows 10 VM. For some reason the original domain user account got removed from the system a while ago and re-added and - I think for that reason - it has a different SID now. Now, there are still files in that old SID's $Recycle.bin and I was asked to recover all of them to their original location. Those files are all still there, I can see them with WinDirStat.
 Now my first instinct was, restoring files that are still in the $Recycle.Bin shouldn't be too hard, right? I mean, they are all still on the drive. But damn, I'm doing research for hours now on how to do it and can't find a way. Luckily it's a VM, so first thing I did was taking a snapshot, so nothing can go wrong when I toy around with the filesystem.
 Opening the folder in Explorer with my Domain-User Account of course is not helping since the files are tied to a different user.The next thing I tried was simply to rename the Recycle Bin subfolder, that includes the old SID as a folder name, to my SID. After I log into my user account then, Windows now tells me my Recycle Bin is corrupted and asks if I want to delete it. So, I reverted to my snapshot.
 There are tons of tools out there that can recover deleted files from NTFS, but seemingly no tools to recover still existing files from the recycler?

 It being fast enough and free is a real help though, and would save us quite a lot, so we were wondering if there’s a way we can utilise it.
 Is there a way to use the guest WiFi login as the incoming line but have our own router create a new network off that with WiFi/Ethernet? We have a draytek vigor 2860ac in a box from the move along with an AirPort Express if that’s of any use, and the new building appears to be using ubiquiti circular ceiling APs of which one is in our new room. 
 I’m semi literate with all this, but there’s definitely a lot of the draytek back end that is past my current knowledge so hopefully I’ll keep up!

 To give some background: We use Linux clients company wide. So any windows-based tool is impossible or needs further expenses we would like to avoid.
 The process is that IT creates the AD-group and defines an owner. The owner (can be everyone in the company) has to check/set members. So the tool should allow to resolve nested-groups to actual people/member. The process of checking the members and the overall requirement of the AD-group itself is part of the compliance processes and belongs to the group owner.
 Right now it's resolved over tickets to the IT which blocks way too much time on the admin side. 
 Our idea is a web-tool which gives all the AD-groups belonging to the owner in a view where they can see the members and add/delete them from the group. Deleting/creating the group shall still be part of IT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm from Germany and evaluating public clouds (esp. for compute, databases, storage, etc.) for our company (30 ppl) regarding a potential migration. Coming from on-premise with dedicated servers I'm collecting pro/cons and potential challenges with a migration and looking for experiences of others who either did or did not a migration:
 - How did your setup looked like before and after migration?
 - What did go wrong during your migration?
 - What's most important to look at in preparation or during migration?
 - Maybe especially for German folks: How did you handle privacy issues (GDPR etc.) and why did you either chose a German or non-german cloud provider?
 - Are there any cloud trends we should look at specifically?
 - What would you love to see changed in public clouds (and is a regular blocker or problem for you)?
 - Which cloud are you using (and why) or why did you not migrated to a cloud?
 Thanks for any comment and thanks for sharing your experience!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm a bit confused on what I can do with radius authentication on a switch DELL N2024. Inside my network I have a lot of programmers that are using some virtual machines for executing vendor based software in their laptop. These virtual machines are otside the domain and also of my control (no antivirus, no policy, ecc). I thougth of isolate the VM traffic using the network authentication in the host PC and also in the VM. The idea is to put the host inside a VLAN that can comunicate with the secure area and the VM in a restricted VLAN. The host usually use only one NIC shared, is it possible with radius authentication assign different VLAN on the same switch port based on the authentication?
 ​
 Any other suggestion will be apreciated. In the era of cryplocker the risk of keep all the traffic together is too big.
 ​
 Thank you.

 I had the same issue twice with Windows Server DHCP service in two different customers in the past few weeks.
 Customer 1: Windows Server 2016 Domain Controller (with DNS and DHCP roles)
 Customer 2: Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller (with DNS and DHCP roles)
 Issue: after installing Windows updates as scheduled, the VM reboots. After reboot, two events are generated in the Event Viewer and the VM stops giving DHCP addresses. The Lease page under DHCP panel is empty.
 Event 1: 
 ID 20090
 SOURCE "DHCP-Server"
 Description " DHCP Server is unable to bind to UDP port number 67 as it is used by another application. This port must be made available to DHCP Server to start servicing the clients."
 Event 2: 
 ID 1041
 SOURCE "DHCP-Server"
 Description " The DHCP service is not servicing any DHCPv4 clients because none of the active network interfaces have statically configured IPv4 addresses, or there are no active interfaces. "
 Resolution:
 Restarting "DHCP server" service fixes the issue. It is still unknown what exactly causes this issue.
 Has anyone encountered anything similar?

 I was trying to find an eventlog eventid for the beginning of login and for when the taskbar is loaded. I've got 7001 for beginning but haven't seen anything which matches load of the desktop/taskbar. Any suggestions would be welcome.
 More info:
  
Hybrid AD joined Windows 10 22H2
 All recent i5 / 16GB laptops
 FSLogix profile redirection
 All devices on WiFi
  
I have tried getting Intune Endpoint Analytics working but very few of the devices are reporting and I haven't been able to determine why. But the downside of this is that it doesn't give a number of seconds, only a score and only reflects when CPU goes below 50% after login.
 My goal is two-fold.
  
Identify problematic endpoints and/or users.
 Prove to management that the median sign-in time is reasonable.
  
(yes, I now know that FSLogix was the wrong choice)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing a deep dive on IPsec right now, trying to understand what exactly is happening under the hood. Went ahead and read (portions) of RFC 4301 but I'm getting conflicting information here regarding the implementation of the SADB vs the SDB.
 In section 4.4.1.2, they walk through the structure of an SDB entry, saying that it includes the following:
  
Match criteria (selectors, names)
 Action (protect/bypass block)
 IPsec Protocol Type
 IPsec Mode
 Tunnel Source & Destination
 Algorithms
 A few other things (i.e. DF bit & DSCP handling)
  
This all sounds well and fine... then I got to 4.4.2.1, talking about the SADB... and some of the same fields are listed there again, including Algorithms (but this time described in greater detail?) as well as the DF bit and DSCP handling piece... I just figured that there was a bit of overlap or something... but then I went to Appendix C, which also describes an SDB entry... and it had even more fields listed which I thought were SADB-only... specifically, the SA lifetime.
 So I'm a bit confused here... would appreciate it if someone could answer the following questions.
  
Are the encryption & confidentiality algoritms included in both the SADB and SDB? Or is the "algorithms" piece in an SDB entry referring to something else?
 Which fields are supposed to overlap between the two databases... and also, why?

 Hey,
 Working on getting a 2022 template in place, and the admin password has been lost, no issues, thought I would reset it the old way with cmd from recovery mode and replace utilman.
 although I can get to recovery and get CMD, for the life of me I can not find what they have mapped c: to, I have been through the whole alphabet from A to Z, I get a hit on x for the recovery.
 I thought I would try from the iso and use the fix my system option, I get a hit once again on x and d this time, but only setup files, not the actual c: drive.
 VM is booting efi and secure boot is off, any thoughts? Is this method still possible or they finally removed it?

 Was able to remediate the initial problem.
 However the client was intent that her system be wiped.
 While onsite, went through and backed up all of the regular folders, documents, downloads, etc.
 I asked the client if this looked okay, she stated that's fine as all of her data was mostly on the cloud. I did double check with her as I have had horror stories with this in the past and she was confident in the cloud.....
 Wiped the machine and have been working on file recovery every since as a lot of the quickbooks files were locally stored. Pulled all of them back from the dead but now they aren't working in QB.
 Feel horrible and still working on it as we speak.. please ask any questions to fill in the blanks of my panic story as I'm sure I've missed a lot of details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my boss retired during COVID lockdown and I've been the interim since then. Went through the whole business of transitioning people to work from home and then back , lots of hours of supervision on top of my sysadmin duties, 50-60 hours work week. Since it is a state agency, we have to apply for the job officially, nobody gets a hand waive promotion if you may. So I applied and to my biggest surprise they offered the job to an outside person who has no sysadmin skills but ran a larger department with more workers. 
 That tells me that my work is not valued and I should start applying for other jobs, right now I feel pretty disappointed and angry at upper management. I have not broken the news to my staff yet because I don't want to be emotional about it, but man I am pissed. I do love being a sysadmin and not have to do front office kind of things. Maybe I will now work for the amount of money they pay me, which is low but with a lot of perks.
 What would you do?

 We have a new web application that sends LDAPS requests to our AD servers over a site-to-site VPN.
 I found out today that during the LDAPS authentication process, the remote app saves the user's password in the app's database. Presumably it's then passed to the app.
 Is this normal? I thought the LDAPS process was simply to get a success/fail authentication and that success/fail is passed on.
 Obviously I don't like my AD passwords saved in someone else's database, even if they are encrypted.

We only have 100Mb down and 10Mb up through Comcast. Before I upgraded us to our ubiquiti hardware we had some really bad latency and speed issues. 
 TLDR: if now one is complianing about speed issues is it worth us going to a faster speed? And is there a way to use the traffic statistics to get a better understanding of how much more we should upgrade if needed?

Fortunately the team thar needed to address the ticket doesn't sit in the office so headed over to my desk to expedite. (I am the head of the department with a couple levels between me and the support desk)
 I asked him if he had a ticket in, and he said "yes but need this right away for something I am doing for the CEO."
 I informed him, "if you put in a ticket our typical SLA is a day or two. It will be worked based on urgency."
 "Well can you check the status?"
 "I assure you if you put the ticket it then if is in the queue and will be processed."
 He left dejected and huff, "I don't understand why it takes a couple of days to just push some buttons."
 I always appreciate the arrogance of people who think they can name drops and bully their way into the front of the line. That isn't our company culture and I know the CEO well enough to know the would be upset if they knew I let this guy skip in line.
 For what's is worth, I reviewed what they were asking for and it isn't something that will be approved anyway. Somebody showed him a beta system that isn't production ready and now he is demanding access--he isn't a beta tester for the system and his desire is to use it for production use.
 Icing on the cake, one of my team members picked up the ticket about an hour after it was submitted and made multiple attempts to reach the manager and couldn't get a response back from them today. As usual it is ultra critical but not critical enough to actually respond.

 Now I get there is should be a vast difference in capability between the bottom and top and companies have a different requirements and risk acceptance factors.
 However I will give the example I worked at a hospice for 50k and they wanted me to hire infrastructure engineers at 23k which was just not possible for competent ones anyway. I explained the risks of hiring people that needed training and asked tounge in cheek why don’t we hire doctors without the experience to perform the role to save money? Well the answer is that’s illegal and we have to pay going rate.
 So my question in a roundabout way is IT salaries so out of Wack because there is no professional accredited body that makes doing IT work illegal without.
 Would it actually benefit IT to have such a body even just for government work. Even if it is a joke like part P or Gas safe but atleast shows some competence

 I have four routers within the same AS and in all 4 routers, BGP is configured. Network 'X' is advertised into BGP, R2 and R3 are working as Route reflectors. R2 is receiving 'x' with a default local preference of 100. Now I want R3 to receive LP 150 so I applied the route map in the OUT direction on R2(towards R3). But R3 is still having local preference 100. I can see the change only if I applied the Route map in IN direction on R3. Same with origin code and metric. I can see changes only on applying the route map in IN direction.
 Why LP/origin/metric isn't propagating from R2 in the update message?
 Sorry for my bad grammar.

 ​
 We have a laptop refresh coming up - 25 Lenovo T14 laptops running Win10.
 We don't deploy new laptops very often - maybe every 5 years. We do not have an imaging infrastructure in place.
 I would like to keep things as simple as possible as I have other things on my To-Do list.
 Here is my plan: Please feel free to comment or add some advice as you see fit.
 ​
  
I plan on building out one of the new Lenovos with all our software and the latest updates.
 
Then sysprep it.
 Use Clonezilla to capture the image onto an SSD or thumb drive
 Then set up a small mini lab where we can deploy 4 or 5 laptops at a time with the image
 Add newly imaged laptops to domain and tweak for individual users (mapped drives, bookmarks, etc.)
  
Question. I plan on just using a thumb drive to boot up Clonzilla on the laptops and using a local SSD drive or thumb drive to host the image file for each laptop. Would it make a speed difference if I store the image file on an SSD USB -C drive as opposed to a regular USB-A drive? 
 ​
 Thanks guys for any wisdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, the following scenario came into my mind, when reading about dynamic routing/tunneling when providing a backup path to a destination.
 In the example there should be one backup path with only static routing to the destiantion, but it should react to a topology change and use the backup path(floating route). The backup/floating static route has a Administrative Distance (AD) of 5 and the primary route an AD of 1.
 https://postimg.cc/ygzqnK5H
 So, if the traffic is tunneld over IPsec (or other tunneling protocol) and the primary tunnel interface goes down, then the static route with an AD of 1 is removed from both routing tables and the second tunnel with the floating static route is used? 
 Is scenario 2 a possible solution to solve scenario 1? 
 Do vendors like cisco or fortinet behave the same way, when scenario 2 is configured?

 Now the device won't accept the password that previously worked. I did not change any other settings except the DNS servers from the default since everything else is locked.
 What exactly did I do wrong? The device has no WAN connection what so ever.

Part of the syslog messages that we depend on is "received bytes and sent bytes" to determine bandwidth usages. This works fine for Juniper/Watchguard/Sonicwalls but now we are trying to add a Meraki MX into the mix and we can get all the info we want from it forwarded to syslog besides the bytes.
 Apparently Cisco only sends that info through Netflow. So I don't really want to purchase an enterprise Netflow collector just for this small bit of information. I don't need a fancy analyzer or anything, just something that is able to collect and forward the info we want. I have looked into a couple via Google and other posts (like ntopng) but haven't had much luck getting this working so far. Any ideas/tips are appreciated!

 Ideally I would like to have hybrid ports with untagged and tagged that are isolated from each other but able to communicate with the privileged port. Most implementation examples I see are for ONYX OS and it assumes that the restricted ports are access only. Yes it's non typical but needed in this particular situation. TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our licensing is up soon for VMWare and my rep reached out to talk about their “new, better” VSphere+ subscription model (a bunch of nonsense to just make more money off of us, by the way they want to bill PER CORE now) that they are looking to implement within the next year, though right now I have the option to re license under our previous agreement “but if I sign up for 3 years with the new VSphere+ they can guarantee my subscription pricing per core and lock in that rate”. Sounds a lot to me like they’re trying to con people into their new pricing scheme before everyone jumps ship when Broadcom fully takes over and destroys their product just like they have for everything else. I was trying to remain hopeful that maybe this time it would be different but…Broadcom hasn’t even fully taken over yet and they’ve already almost doubled my licensing cost per year with this new scheme, what a scam. I got a laugh when I got the cautionary reminder at the end of the email “the price can be locked in year over year with VSphere+, but the price can’t be guaranteed when you’re up for renewal next year if you don’t go with the proposed pricing”. 
 Needless to say, I’m going to talk to my team about it all but I believe we’re are going to be in the market for something else. Anyone have any recommendations? Has anyone else made the migration to something new recently?

 To summarise my position; I'm the IT "supervisor" but really manager. My boss is the director but still doesn managerial stuff so I'm caught in this weird limbo.
 It's a small place so I'm also not being paid well compared to others in the field but that's the tradeoff with SMBs, I think.
 My wife feels like it might be time for me to go to #4 and make a career move and I do agree with her.
 For what it matters, I'm also located in Canada.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am reaching out because I have a customer where all of their 25Gbit SFP28 links port flap connected to a Cisco ACI (that both leafs had been replaced already in.)
 The daughtercard is:
 ConnectX-4 Lx 25 GbE SFP28
 The SFPs are: SFP28-25G-SR-NOF (but I'm not sure if FEC is enabled)
 I read that the DFE tuning delay can cause the adapter to not link up when it isn't set to 3000ms, but the ports are still flapping for some unknown reason, and that seems more like a complete loss of network scenario. 
 Can FEC when mismatched on the switch and server side cause a port flap?
 The links would also not link up with the link speed forced to 25gbit, they will only link with auto negotiation.
 At one point, all of the adapters flapped at the same time.
 ​
 Any advice appreciated.

 I'm trying to configure this net:
  
3 Tagged VLANS
 1 Untagged VLAN (Default)
 Fortinet 60F Router
 Allied Telesis x510 (52 ports) Switch
  
All VLANS are connected from the router to the switch with a single cable (port that I have configured as promiscuous). Subsequently, I have configured the rest of the ports through the interface as "Untagged" ports by groups according to which VLAN I want each port to receive. 
 As I understood, with this, I should be able to connect a PC to any of the ports assigned to a VLAN (tagged or untagged) and the computer would receive internet without having to configure the VLAN ID on the network card of the computer.
 Also, I need some ports to offer multiple VLANS so that I can configure APs with guest wifi that cannot access the rest of the network.
 However, I only receive internet on the ports that I have not configured a specific VLAN.
 What am I misising? 
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently had a switch in our website hosting provider and I'm hitting my head against the wall on what I'm missing here. Everything works externally, but we have a split-brain DNS setup in our internal network. It's been set up that way for a long time and it's not something I can completely remove unfortunately, at least not right now.
 So externally, www.domain.com resolves and is proxied through Cloudflare and life is good. (see screenshot in attached album)
 Internally, however, is where things aren't currently working. Our previous hosting provider had a trusted CA issued cert installed on the origin server, and so we could simply point our internal DNS to the same public IP that CF was pointed to and everything would work fine. This new hosting provider insists on having a self signed cert on their side however. Why this is I'm still trying to figure out in my continued discussions with them, but for now that's what we've got and obviously that causes issues with 'site unsecure' warnings if we set it up like we had done before.
 So what I was trying to do is simply point our internal DNS to the CF proxied route, and per here and here I was under the impression I could simply create a CNAME entry for www.domain.com and point it to www.domain.com.cdn.cloudflare.net. (see screenshot in attached album). But clearly I'm still missing something because even with that things aren't working - Chrome gives an "ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" error even though NSLOOKUP seems to resolve to the CF IP's just fine (again, see screenshots in attached album). 
 Anyone dealt with a similar issue before? Thank you!!

 I was wondering if anyone here had a computer stipend for certain departments in your companies ? 
 I am trying to find out the pro/cons for letting engineers have their own stipend to pick out their computers vs we pick out their computers .
 Either way they would be required to have intune and follow compliance policies. It’s only a matter of whether they tell us what they want and we order it or we pick what they use.
 Would love to hear experiences and pro/cons

 Quick question, how do I go about finding network engineer roles which are more focused on network automation ? I'm barely getting any matches on job boards when I search "network automation" and "netdevops". 90% of the traditional senior/network engineer roles I see just say python or ansible is a plus.
 From what it looks like I may have to just get lucky ? and find a company that either is about to start this journey or already has started and looking for engineers to join the team.
 I'm using indeed and linkedin for my job searches.
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have been lurking for some time, and now could really use some good advice.
 The story is, we are a retail chain with around 15 stores, 2 offices and a large online presence. I came onboard about 3 years ago with the responsibility for our ERP, Azure hosting and web team. The other guy took care of all hardware, some support and the odd jobs that came up. Between us we also took care of all the different hardware and software people use. We have around 200 employees across parttime to fulltime.
 The other guy was beginning to slack a bit, came in late and did not always do his tasks, so the CEO had made a plan with me where I should be the head of IT in 6 to 12 months and we should hire more people, at minimum a Sysadmin and a Supporter.
 We had not yet presented the plan for my colleague.
 Yesterday they found my colleague dead in his apartment, and I got a call from the CEO about it, where he stated that I was now head of IT and should start as soon as possible.
 My plan is to start securing we have access to all the systems he worked with, and create a common password database in something like Bitwarden. Then talk to all the different departments about what projects they had going on, and how to get support moving forward.
 I could really use some advise, where would you guys start?
 Rest in piece other guy, I will keep your lasts sessions online for as long ass possible. You will be missed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So you may have seen my post a few weeks ago about cyber insurance deeming MFA on every single admin device, network equipment, accounts etc. We’re slowly working down our list of stuff that we need to action, but as I am not that clued up on network, our manager is the one responsible for the network and network switches across all our offices. Some of these switches are 10-20 years old, and absolutely cannot support any form of MFA, even RADIUS. The rest of the team saw this as a great opportunity for a use case to replace these old switches with something more modern and would be compliant with our requirements. Our manager has grown to have a bit of a reputation within the team of just being lazy, and only wants to touch what he knows. Whilst our insurance deems it a requirement to protect these switches with MFA, the argument we got back was “what are they going to do? Look what device is plugged in?”
 Apart from the fact these switches are almost 20 year old so have obvious security flaws in them anyway, what would the worst case scenario be if someone malicious had access to a switch within a network?

 It appears to be machine specific. Users can login to another machine and OneDrive is OK. Also users can login to a broken machine and cannot sync.
 Things we have tried:
 OneDrive reset
 OneDrive uninstall/reinstall
 Manually delete all OneDrive appdata and sync folders
 Office repair and uninstall/reinstall
 We do not have restrictions to only allow syncing on PCs joined to specific domains
 SARA reports the issue is OneDrive account not signed in
 Settings on this page OneDrive sync error Sorry, OneDrive can’t add your folder right now - SharePoint | Microsoft Learn
 We do have a ticket open with MS support, but hoping someone else has experienced this before.

 At my desk i currently have my work macbook pro and my personal macbook pro. 
 The macbooks are hooked up to a lenovo usb-c dock for my monitor and ethernet. When i wanna switch from my work system to my home system i just unplug the usbc and replug. 
 Is there any way i can have a usb-C switch? So i can leave them both plugged in and just flip between them to toggle the connection.
 I tried googling but I’m unsure of what the name for a cable/device would be.
 I should also mention it needs to allow power delivery, display, network and usb
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many others we moved to use “known folder move” some time ago. As part of that we set up two things: 1. A baseline in sccm to check folders are in the expected locations. Eg. C:\users\Geoff\onedrive - contoso\desktop (or pictures or documents) 2. The admin reports policy so we can use the reports at confit.microsoft.com
 We hit go and watched with glee as the admin report went from 0% to around 90%. Never got to 100.. and forgot about it all as we moved to more important things.
 Now I’m reviewing our settings and status and I’ve found a couple of weird things
 Firstly some users have moved their folders into random folders, or so it would seem, like into the sub folder of some obscure project. Too few to be a mis configuration, too many for it to be accidental drag and drops.
 Secondly the admin reports have gone backwards, sitting at 75% or so
 Has anyone else had these experiences? Are you doing any manual remediation on these things? Should I be worried about any of this?!

I did buy a server for my SME back in 2019 which sadly broke down about 2months ago. After testing thoroughly and going to multiple stores that said they can fix this server. I found out its the board and the cpu that died and since Dell emailed back telling me that theres nothing they'll do because it was a few month after the warranty ended and fixing would cost as much as buying it new any board/cpu I should know that would fit right with the components I already have? I remember back when I was reusing dell's gaming pc, the mb would have its front io pins which will not work with normal pc cases in the market. I did find my way around by buying front IO cables from china that was modified for dell's front IO. I am not sure if I am wasting my time trying to fix this server, will it be difficult to find a board that fits the case? 
 The server was a EMC R340 bought in 2019 with Xeon E 2124 + R171TT1 MB 17086-1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 We have 600 legacy 'programs' that have embedded credentials so they can be installed without admin rights. (can't get rid of the at this point sadly...) 
 We've recently started a shift from onprem AD to azure with autopilot, and our domian name changed. Let's call them:
 CompanyOnPrem. com
 CompanyCloud. com
 The embedded ID authenticates against CompanyOnPrem. com\account1. This account is synchronized with AzureAD so it has the correct rights in CompanyCloud, but of course the programs won't install because CompanyOnPrem is also embedded in the install file. 
 HOWEVER! If I open anything (run CMD as a different user/admin) on the device using the CompanyCloud as the domain just once, now all the install files work perfectly.
 To summarized: 
 File has CompanyOnPrem. com\account1 embedded & will not install. 
 Open CMD as account1@CompanyCloud. com and close it. Now all install files work fine. 
 It's like running it once is creating a pointer or a DNS rescored that redirects the authentication - which is actually great for us. 
 Does anyone know specifically what is happening and where these credentials are stored?

I'm in the military and my contract is about to end, and I've set myself up to be decently comfortable doing DOD networking without a uniform. I have a degree, Sec+, CCNA, and hopefully about to pass my ENCOR. I really enjoy networking and want to get paid what I'm worth since enlisted military doesn't get paid very well. I'd like to get ENARSI soon after because it sounds fun, but even studying for the ENCOR I see how much emphasis Cisco puts on their products and automation and I really just don't get much joy from learning all that. I'm also unsure how AI and automation is going to affect the networking career field 10, 20 years from now.
 If I choose to go the cyber security route I'd have to reenlist for another 4 years and live a restrictive life with bad pay - but I'd be put on the path for some cool defensive cyber operation skills. I'd get schooling, certifications, and be working with a very very exclusive club. As far as I can tell, these guys get paid more than networking guys too. 
 I know there's a lot of people with much more experience and knowledge than me here and I was hoping maybe you could tell me something that would sway me into one direction or another.

Things like "change management" are actively avoided by senior staff because "it'll just slow us down". I try to advocate that a functional change control process should not slow down change but encourage it.
 Additionally, we had an incident occur with one of our services recently and while the response was ok, nothing was written down by my team members. No incident ticket, no post-incident review, nothing. Service is back up, incident over. I'd assume that each person has their own personal notepad++ open to write down the incident response notes.
 My direct suggested I make a proposal things I would like implement, i.e. a system for tracking changes, ongoing problems, incidents etc. but as I'm writing the proposal I find myself wondering what I'm even doing. It's obvious that this isn't even a priority for higher ups so I'm probably just wasting time right? 
 Maybe I'm getting in my own head too much, maybe I'm frustrated this keeps happening at every IT department:(

 On-premise Exchange 2016, active sync and web accss enabled email account. Have an MSP for Network config and support, no access to firewall or network monitoring.
 User reports one morning her account is locked, unlock it, locked again within a minute. Go through the normal steps; make sure your phone isn’t locking you account, logged into another device, etc.
 Logs reveal Exchange is the source of the lockouts, try disabling web access, OWA, and active sync for this user. Lockouts continue. Escalate for Network help from MSP.
 They determine it’s coming from overseas multiple IPs, etc. I ask if we can Geo Lock, block it, or whatever their recommendation is. I also asked why if Web Access is disabled that the login attempts matter.
 They confer with the IT Manager and decide to have me change the user account name to [username]2. I protest that this isn’t really a fix as much as ignoring the problem. Decision made.
 I change user account to (2), and then resolve the issues with connected apps because they are now a new account for many apps. Also reset and re-enroll users MDM controlled cell phone. Issue is “resolved”.
 I don’t like this solution, but I don’t know how to explain why to the IT Manager or what I should have expected from the MSP. If anyone is willing, please give me some advice.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry this is slightly off topic. I work for a large organization that occasionally has phone numbers marked as "spam". We usually find out about this after a customer mentions it. We'll test on various personal cell phones and submit removal requests to carriers, and they remove the flag. 
 This only happens once or twice a year. We follow pretty strict anti-spam call policies, but sometimes they still get marked. 
 Is there an API that we can use to check numbers daily? I've tried Twilio's phone-number lookup endpoint, but I don't think it will give spam signals. We even signed up for a "phone number reputation" service that did absolutely nothing to protect our numbers. 
 Would love to know what others are doing to monitor their brand's phone number reputations.

 Not sure if this is an issue that any of you face, but how do you monitor changes the Terms of Use for your suppliers?
 We currently use approximately 1,000,000* SaaS products, along with a frankly extremely difficult ISP, who all follow the trend of: "Our ToS are at this url, it's on you to check it regularly, you have 30 days to kick up a fuss when we change them to be worse"
 Do you use a product to monitor these web pages? If so what do you use? And if not would there be some value for you in someone making one in their downtime? I am considering making something just for my own purposes, but if there's a market I'll happily release it.

 So I've worked in "Networks" for almost 9 years now (wow it's gone fast!). The first 4 years I was your traditional networking engineer/admin working mainly on Datacentre and a little bit of Enterprise networks which I enjoyed but found the pace and travelling a bit stressful, although I think that was mainly due to the work culture i was in. I left that role in a hurry as the company took a turn for the worst and I got a Systems Engineering role focused on communications(networks). I've been here for nearly 5 years now and I find it quite mundane and none challenging and the pay is quite a bit lower compared to engineers working in I.T.
 I have considered going back into I.T but as ive been away from the CLI and "traditional" networking for a while I feel like I won't be able to. I guess you could say I've traded my hands on experience for more theory knowledge, understanding protocol standards, more physical layer including RF and the innerworkings of network devices and how they are integrated into a system of systems rather than end users. I know this is quite a unique situation but just wondering if any one has done something similar? Or has any opinions on me being able to get another job in I.T. Happy to answer more detailed questions if needed.

 I am curious: What devices do you use for NAT/Routing at the Uplink of big Networks (like 20 Gbit/s, 60k Clients).

For Switches, we are a complete HPE-Shop and would consider MikroTik to prosumer for the task, but somehow, we ended up with this white box in our biggest core rack … Our smaller setups use Sophos Systems, but we feel like they‘re not purpose built to be fast packet-spitting roaring routing machines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering a small FTTH build and I'd like to get a feel for which vendors have the best reputation and should make my short list.
 Right now I understand that Adtran and Nokia are probably the leaders but how do Calix and some of the other solutions (like Juniper Unified PON) compare?
 Based on my limited experience and research, Adtran seems to be the winner here for smaller deployments like my planned one but maybe there is something I don't know?
 I know about Ubiquiti Networks PON platform already and it's a possibility but I'd like to invest in something a bit more in line with what some of the other operators around me are using rather than be a one-off (even if that's the way I end up going in the end).
 Thanks in advance for your help.

 Is the advice in the Wiki for the most part still relevant? A lot of the posts it links to are are roughly a decade old and I was wondering if the advice from those posts would still hold up today.
 I understand the requirement to be constantly learning and updating skills in the field and that it is not for everyone, but I would just like to know if what I read through is still a good starting point.
 I am just considering my options as I wish to get out of my current position (retail management). I used to have a pretty strong passion for IT but it kind of died with my current career.
 Cheers.

 The switches are brand new, I tried the setup with no stacking fiber cables connected and with the cables connected too.
 I can execute every command fine, but when I get to execute
 ​
  
FS(config-vsl-port)#port-member interface Tengigabitethernet 0/49
  
​
 I get this error back:
 ​
  
Port tengigabitethernet 0/49 could not be configured to vsl. 
 Port check failed.
  
​
 I tried other ports but I get the same error, what can I do? Someone who had experience with this vendor switch? The switches are brand new with default configuration out of the box.

JG924A-1920-24G (Non-PoE), HP JD992A V1905-24-POE, and looking to get a HP ProCurve V1810-48G. The 48 port will be going in my loft, as will the PoE switch (this is only for cameras and sensors hence the 100mb ports) so I need the SFPs and a short fibre cable between those. Then I need SFPs between the 48G and the 24G, the fibre cable will have to run about 50 meters. If anyone can point me to which ones I need that also won’t break the bank it would be much appreciated. Tia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was like 15 years ago. We had a client come in that was the most sexist human being I've ever met and I have worked with people from all levels of wealth and from like 30 countries.
 It was him, me, and our site manager(a woman) in a conference room with him sitting across from me and the site manager sitting next to each other. Every time the site manager asked a question, he would make it quite clear that he was responding to me because he was disgusted that a woman was in charge of the site. It was insane to watch and be the person he chose over responding to a lowly woman. I didn't know what to do. I was young and new to the company. If it happened now, I'd be all, yo, this is unacceptable but where I was in my life at that time, I chose the passive aggressive route.
 You really have to picture this in your head because it really went down this way.
 She would ask a question, he would look at me to respond, and I slowly leaned over until my head was behind hers so he had to at least look in her direction while speaking.
 She was clearly and understandably appalled at the situation but she was also trying not to laugh at what I was doing.
 Side note: The primary owner of our company is awesome and later that day told that guy to gtfo of our building and our contract was cancelled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our security policy, we have a highly segmented, firewall and switch routed network with next generation Web Application Firewalls.
 When setting up new servers, production machines, cloud services or new (client/server) applications, our firewall team needs to be involved. While that's perfectly fine, it feels like a new endeavor every time, even if it's the third or tenth machine of the same type.
 We need to specify source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols (and I'm happy with that), but don't have a very structured and repeatable approach in doing so. And the firewall teams documentation of rules and changes "in the firewall" seems somewhat intransparent. That process is time consuming with repeated discussions on why we need this port or that protocol and we sometimes end up with issues because of that.
 Can you share or recommend a lean process on requesting, documenting, and auditing firewall rules? Please also point me to other reddits if I am a bit off topic here.

 We're currently using Meraki, and I'm not overly keen on it. Crazy expensive hardware and licenses, increasingly common hardware failures, pretty average feature sets. Yet somehow it sort of just works. We can create a site to site VPN easily, manage switches and APs and firewalls from anywhere, and I have to say, I like that. 
 I was looking at potential other solutions. From their marketing, you would think Ubiquiti would be a good choice - absolutely not, I wouldn't use their stuff outside of SOHO or prosumer environments. With the possible exception of HP Aruba, it looks like most alternatives means leaving that single ecosystem that I've actually come to take for granted to an extent. Perhaps renewing the licenses next year is the best plan?
 But in any case, I'm interested to know how other people manage their networks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an odd request, but please hear me out. My company provides control panels with very small (like 2-3 device) isolated TCP/IP networks. Occasionally, a device needs to be serviced by connecting a laptop with programming software installed. This software interacts over a TCP/IP connection with the devices in the panel. The software is expensive, difficult to install, and difficult to license. It is not something we could just send an installer to our customers to install on a local laptop, most of the time. Furthermore, asking to remote into a customer's machine would be seen as unprofessional in this industry.
 I may post a similar question on /r/plc where I normally hang out, but I am looking for something more than the current ways I've seen/done this:
  
VERY EXPENSIVE - drive or fly to the site just to plug in an ethernet cable to the laptop with the right software on it.
 MEDIUM EXPENSE - send a laptop with the software installed to site with instructions for site personnel to get it connected to the panel's switch. This ties up a full set of software licenses (this can be 5 figure licenses)
 MEDIUM EXPENSE - send or permanently install a dedicated cellular VPN box (usually netbiter, eWon or Secomea) out that puts the engineer's licensed laptop on the panel's network
 LOWEST EXPENSE - if the customer has the right combination of competency and flexibility in their IT dept, set up VPN access to the network 
  
Ok, so here's where I'm wondering if there's a 5th option. Is there a way to set up a laptop that just functions as a VPN server, rather than client. Like, is there a cisco or whatever program I can install on a win10/11 laptop that, when running, allows remote vpn clients to access the laptop's local network? 
 All of the above is typically done as supervised, extremely temporary connections to these systems. I am aware these all represent security risks except #1. Please refrain from chastising my industry for our security practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work maybe 6-7h each day, really not that much compared to what I read from other guys in this sub. However during that time I am hyper focused. The only break that I take is 30 minutes for lunch, and I mean really no other break at all. I don’t kick back in my seat, take care of personal stuff or get up to walk around the room for a bit. Instead I jump from one task to the next, whether that’s a meeting, monitoring alert, ticket, project, chat message, email, you name it. The stimulation is just so intense that I can’t get out once I’m in. What I don’t realize during that time is that I’m completely overstimulating by brain. I don’t give it time to process anything. So once I stop working my mind starts racing about everything I touched throughout the workday. I go over the meeting in my head, I think about if I forgot something on the ticket I worked on, if the next steps for the project are correct, etc. I go to bed with these thoughts and I wake up with them. Only after about 2 days of not working (typically on Sundays or today after a holiday) the thoughts start to slow down. This really sucks because I am not fully present with my family unless I’m on holiday and generally I’m just burning myself out. I know what I shouldn’t be doing but I just can’t stop it. I tried a couple of things to mitigate that:
  
A physical alert on my desk which goes off after 2h to remind me to get up (which I happily ignore once I’m into the vortex)
 A tool on my computer which actually blocks the screen for 5 minutes to force a break (which annoyed me too much when I was deep into something or in a meeting)
 Countless of post-its to remind me of breaks (which you guessed it, I ignore)
  
Have any of you experienced the same and found a solution to this?
 PS: I should mention that neither my boss or any external factor are forcing this behavior on me. While I had jobs in the past where that was the case, today it’s not.

 It took multiple times and rewrites of instructions to even get them to install the AV and remote software. The migration from their e-mail system to O365 from a technical standpoint was pretty smooth. However we are getting a lot of users saying its slow, mail isn't loading as it should etc etc
 I understand there is a cultural language and time barrier, and I've pleased with leadership to send me over there to get a better grasp on things and their userbase and workflows. I guess I am more venting than anything because I've tried just about everything to help them out.

 We will have two identical 4K 27inc displays daisy chained and connect one USB-C/Thunderbolt cable to our laptops.
 Given we move between desks, will people with every new desk have to change their display order/orientation or is there a trick to it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there.
 We currently utilize Barracuda for our Third Party Spam Filtering. MX->Barracuda->O365.
 The only inbound connector we have is scoped to only accept mail from Barracuda IPs.
 Mail Rule to set the SCL to -1 when mail is received from Barracuda IPs to ensure O365 scanning is bypassed.
 We recently upgraded our Microsoft Licensing which allows additional email security on the O365 Side. 
 While Barracuda does a pretty good job at keeping the bad-guys away, I'm considering layering *some* of the scanning/security such that any email that comes into our organization, first passes through Barracuda for Scans, then an additional scan is done at the O365 level before delivering to the user mailbox.
 Seeing the recommendation is to enable Enhanced Filtering.
 https://campus.barracuda.com/product/emailgatewaydefense/doc/96023002/enhanced-connectors-vs-mail-flow-rules-for-spam-filtering/
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/enhanced-filtering-for-connectors#what-happens-when-you-enable-enhanced-filtering-for-connectors
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-mail-flow-using-third-party-cloud#scenario-1---mx-record-points-to-third-party-spam-filtering
 ​
 I'm assuming this is a modification to the existing inbound connector to enable Skip Listing, and the SkipIPs then become a list of IPs that Barracuda uses - essentially allowing us to keep the scoping in place for the connector to only allow Barracuda IPs. We would then 'remove' the SCL-1 rule.
 While this might come with some additional management - I can see the benefits of having an integrated filter in place (Impersonation etc etc).
 Anyone else setup this way? Pros? Cons? lessons learned?
 Appreciate the help.

 I joined this company around 1.5 years ago. Great company, nice people and 100% remote. I was hired to manage a Windows environment and some small Azure related projects. Down the road last year, a few key people in the company quit and I had to step up to take more responsibilities especially for managing other cloud environments (AWS/Linux and some DevOps) and I was told at that time that they'll look into getting a raise for me. I also got a few Azure/AWS certs and spent many extra hours to learn and manage these environments. Although, besides the regular 5% annual raise, there haven't been any discussions around the raise. I really enjoy my time working here but I have been told by others to start looking somewhere else but my experience has been very good with the company, and also having imposter syndrome to apply elsewhere. Would like some advice on where to go from here. Thanks! Location: ON, CA. Sal: C$60k

 Many of us have used terminal programs like XCopy to transfer only a specific subset of files and to include/exclude only certain details such as modification dates, file permissions, etc. 
 Should operating systems include these types of functions into their GUI, possibly in the toolbar or elsewhere?

 We have a "Cisco like" 4 port router (not gonna get too into details on the router due to company stuff) and we're using a satellite modem to reach back to another end. Our issue currently is that we magically had connectivity on the router for probably 2 minutes, then can't ping the modem. We changed the FE 0/0 port to be in the same "net" as the modem (just changed it to a .3 because modem is a .1 and the dish controller is a .2) and was told to add "ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1" into our config but can't even ping the modem anymore. Any thoughts? I'll answer some questions if you have any, but will keep some stuff vague due to company stuff

 It must have both Bluetooth and a unifying receiver. So that I can switch devices between my company laptop, personal tablet, and my Google TV. 
 For connecting to my company laptop, I would prefer to use a USB receiver. For connecting to my personal tablet and Google TV, I would need the Bluetooth connectivity. 
 So far I'm looking at the Logitech K375s keyboard + Logitech m720 triathlon. 
 Just wondering do you guys have any better recommendations?

 i have been using session buddy for a while, in order to at least save the tabs i have setup for a browser. Since browsers have the ability to group tabs, i would love to save not only the tabs themselves but of course also the groups. Restoring tabs is not an issue, but having then to manually setup the groups and add the tabs is painfull (esp. across multiple devices). Session buddy does not do this. 
 Anybody know of an extension (chrome) that saves both? and maybe even syncs the profile + tabs + groups + extensions? 
 thanks in advance for any usefull hints :)
 Edit: I found the flag #tab-groups-save so i will test that (sadly it is experimental)

 They act like people will die if they don't stay late to complete whatever task. Then they come into work depressed the next day, expecting other staff to feel sorry for them for being the "hero" who worked late. Bad luck, no one notices because other staff are living their best lives.
 Reality check 1:
 Your job isn't that important, you aren't saving the world. And that's OK.
 Reality check 2:
 Your boss is not your friend. If they were, they wouldn't let you work late. They would care about your health and wellness.
 You are an employee. Work hard but go home on time. If your boss says there's too much work, that's a management problem. They need to hire more people. You still go home on time. If they don't like that, find another job. I've been there. Yes, it's really that simple. You are exchanging time for money. This is just a business transaction.

Ever since I've popped my 3389 and 3390 ports open I've noticed brute force attempts in the security events logs. Pretty lame attempts at that, as they try different usernames with every attempt, with the occasional consistent administrator account. 
 I guess my question is, even if they were to successfully brute force my password, wouldn't they hit the same 2FA prompt that I do when I access remotely? Would they be able to access any other areas of the network or devices? I also have all my devices running through NordVPN when home which blocks all external access.

 I get no budget / spending power and they do not want to spend a PENNY on I.T / Sec. 
 I asked them if we can expand into an MSP space and they said yes, just to take it back after I signed clients and started working telling me “your job is on-demand because it’s break-fix and not full time” ( I AM THE ONLY ONE THERE AND YOUR COMPANY’s IT IS A DUMPSTER FIRE)
 I stayed patience up until yesterday where my boss assured me she’d have a compensation structure for me and the MSP vertical. I scheduled a resignation at 5:00 the next day because I knew she wouldn’t do anything and I gave them a week’s notice. 
 This is the text I got: “Your resignation is accepted and is effective immediately. Let’s coordinate a time this weekend to meet in order to go over any pending assignments and for you to transfer any assets you have to the firm. Also, please clean out your office by Sunday evening. 
 Thank you for your service and we wish you all the best in all of your future endeavors. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. 
 All the best!”
 And they sent an email not including me to the rest of the staff saying that my last day was today. Like dude, I quit, don’t make it sound like you fired me. 
 I’m trying hard to not exact revenge. I was too loyal is the problem.
 Not worth $20 / hr to have every position at the same time. I polished my resume and fucked out of there before the inevitable disaster.
 Please be blunt and tell me if I’m dumb. You may need more info, I had so much shit today I forgot 90% of it.
 EDIT: I see you and I’m upvoting I promise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last few years I’ve seen so many issues with support but today was the cherry on top. 
 It’s been a day since we submitted a ticket for one of our customers and I have received almost nothing from them. I called to escalate early this morning. They tried to call apparently but I had no such calls come in and I’ve been at my desk since 730 am. I called again after they put the ticket on hold and requested they escalate again and reach out via email. They reached out via email requesting information and I provided everything they asked for immediately. Radio silence until I called again. Then I got an email saying my ticket has been escalated to tier 2 support. Radio silence yet again. It’s now been 30 hours since we put in the ticket and nothings happening. 
 The express ticketing status page went down around 12pm today so I can’t even see if someone’s actively working on it or not. I tried just scheduling a tech to come from the level 1 support but apparently that can’t happen without circuit team initiating it. Level 1 support somewhat admitted they have been having issues reaching the circuit team but when they saw my ticket they got audibly nervous so maybe it was just a mistake. 
 Other rant about AT&T don’t let your equipment go down or they’ll give away your IPs and they won’t even give you DHCP til you call …if you can get a hold of them. Have a new customer that just got dedicated fiber from them I set up their network a month ago got the service online but they didn’t need it for a month and a power outage knocked them offline permanently but they didn’t know until it was time to use it. Took a week to get a technician to come in and reprovision the equipment.

 I've spent most of my sys admin career in a primarily windows environment, but I've recently moved to a shop that's about 50/50. Early in my career, I was advised to never bother, and just use nano instead, which works enough like a regular text editor that anyone can use it with no special training. 
 The problem is I now catch a lot side glances from the career Linux guys for using nano. The people who have primarily worked in Linux all seem to be VI guys.
 I haven't really put effort into learning it, my vi knowledge is basically :q! If I accidentally open it.
 What do you guys think, is it actually something worth learning, or is it just a preference thing? Alternately, is it worth doing just as a marker for being a Linux pro?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bunch of routers at remote sites that I am trying to get a rough idea of their average traffic in bps out of a certain interface based on their counters. I'm just wondering if my methodology makes sense. Obviously there are better ways to do this but I was not given the lead time to setup monitoring and gather enough data.
 First I take the counter uptime in weeks and days and calculate the total number of seconds.
 TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS = (((UPTIME_WEEKS * 7) + UPTIME_DAYS) * 24) * 3600 
 My goal is to get a rough idea of the usage per second. But most of this traffic is during working hours and the uptime above is 24/7. So I divide by 5 since after nights, weekends and holidays I figure the vast majority of traffic is generated in just 20% of the time
 TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS = TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS / 5
 Then I calculate the number of bits from the number of bytes in the counters
 TOTAL_BITS = TOTAL_BYTES * 8
 Then I calculate the bits per second by dividing by the TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS
 AVG_bps = TOTAL_BITS / TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS
 Obviously this is a very rough average not taking bursts into account but I'm also taking some random 5 min average readings will pad the result. Just wondering if I went totally off-the-rails somewhere.

 I am sure many of you know what KnowB4 is. For those that don't, it is a security awareness training program that helps users to take extra precautions when it come to opening emails and trickery of phishing and whatnot. 
 When we sent out a test campaign, and a user falls for it, they user will get a training class assigned to them where they'll have to watch it and take a quiz helping them not fall for it again in the future. 
 We started this about a year ago, but lately we have users who get supper offended when they fall for one the campaigns that get sent to them and get really upset that they have to do the class and quiz. It is starting to really piss me off. They're thanking we (IT) purposely are trying to make them fall for it so we can give them a shitty day. That isn't the case. We are better safe than sorry. 
 What I need help with is who can draft me a crafty email explaining how it isn't us against them and that this tool is there to help us all take extra precautions rather than feeling that IT is trying to make you fall for those tests. 
 Because as I am drafting the email, I finding it to be in a very pissed off tone which is making me hesitant to send it to the whole company. Who is good at making this email tone very firm and a**holic, but at the same time friendly? lol

 Does anyone know how to manually refresh or initiate the DNS check for DKIM?

 In trying to issue new certificate templates I noticed the option was greyed out which led me down a rabbit hole of issues (that I don't completely understand) 
 When I look at the Root CA in certsrv, it's got a name of the old DC hostname and not the new server host name.

 Could this be my problem? Did Microsoft botch the migration? What can I do to rectify this, assuming the CA server needs to be the name on the cert

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope somebody can help me find an answer. Unfortunately my past network architecture experience is almost a decade out of date and was with Brocade/Fastiron. We did a lot of mesh IP networks matching SAN network meshes, and it was amazing.
 I'm now in a position and we are considering using Edgecore/Wedge with CumulusLinux for a network rollout. I'm trying to figure out if its possible to do a PoD type network mesh design, but I'm coming up short as I search the internet. We haven't purchased these so we also have no support contact as of yet.
 What I have is a group of 8x racks with two switches per rack, and I'm debating what will be the best configuration to avoid or at least reduce having to do the classic multi-layer datacenter aggregation of switches to switches. We also won't be controlling the upper networks, it'll just be going directly into an ISP from within each group of 8 racks, and I want them cross-connected for faster local networking.
 If anybody knows if this is possible, thanks!
 I know I can create bridges between switches, that's fairly normal stuff. It's when you get loops even within a mesh that I'm less certain about.
 [edit]
 To clarify: What I have in mind is a classic star-mesh network from the SAN world, but in the IP world. I don't know if this is possible with this gear. It is possible with FastIron, but that might be the extent of it, and nobody else has done this sort of thing. I know Brocade was trying to push it as an open standard but after their demise maybe it just fell away.
 If not, then what is the next-ideal configuration, with 16 switches, and 2x uplinks?

 It's been a month since my internship has begun at an MSP. It's a 100% remote position and most days, I do nothing except participate to 1 to 3 useless meetings.
 Of course, I already talked to my boss about it (I would say something like "hey I have free time right now, If I can be of any help for anything please reach out to me") And when I say that, he would always ask someone in the team to call me on Teams to explain 2-3 projects they are working on, but it's useless because each time they would not give me any work to participate in these projects, they are always waiting on dependencies to be solved by someone else so I just have to wait.
 My worst issue is the daily stand up meeting where I always have to make up something to talk about.
 Do you think it's a common issue during an internship or at the beginning of a new job? I feel so bored. I was working on many exciting projects while I was a student and I miss this time so much.
 Sorry if my english is not perfect - french is my first language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to cross post from the juniper subreddit but it seems I cannot.
 Hi all
 We have an old handmedown mx480 we barely utilize. It has a pair of 16xge cards in it now. We are planning to add another card later this year thanks to some growth.
 I didn’t realize one of those cards was damaged early on and wrecked two of the backplane slots (:() forcefully trying to get the xge card with slightly bent rear pins in. Rookie mistake. It also has only re-s-2000s in it. It seems to be doing fine now with the four full tables it gets but I know I’m pushing my luck, it runs 32 bit junos (and from what I can read, only supports up to what it runs now at 15.1), and we probably will be adding significantly more routes over next few years.
 I’d like to get something that is newer but still used and has potential for another 4-6 years of JunOS support. I’m happy with the mx480 platform and am not angling to change. Especially since if I get a newer chassis I can reuse my existing power supplies and have a spare fan module. Is the mx480- bp3 chassis with scbe2/re-s-1800x4-32g new enough to achieve that goal? Latest JunOS for a while, full tables, relatively newish.
 So far as I can tell, even the current MX isn’t stressed out at all…. I really am just thinking about the next half decade more than the now. Rather make the change now than when more people will be impacted. https://postimg.cc/GBxyfqj2
 EDIT: the big cpu spikes were me switching routing engines so I could reboot them. Four plus years uptime. Some things were acting up like a snmp poll taking 7 minutes. That’s not from normal load.

Windows 11 is a must, but it does not need to connect to local resources. Essentially, a Windows desktop accessible from any standard internet-connected computer. Ideally, I don't want to host my own hardware, the environment would be desktop as a service. It may just be this is what the market is and that's fine, but I wanted to cast a wider net and make sure I'm not missing something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All DCs are currently W2K16, but will be swapped out for all W2K19 in a few months. All DCs support only "RC4, AES 128, AES 256" encryption types (no DES). 
 Some AD accounts (mostly computer objects for Linux systems with Centrify agent installed) support only "DES, RC4".
 Some other accounts (also Centrify systems) support "DES, RC4, AES128, AES256". The rest (vast majority Windows systems, nothing lower than W2K12R2/Win10) of accounts don't support DES at all. 
 Question 1: Without the DCs supporting for DES, is having "DES" as a supported type on a bunch of computer objects an actual risk item? We are logging everything into Splunk and there are zero events indicating DES is in use. These accounts turned up in an internal audit, but the actual risk seems non-existent. We will remediate them anyway but I'm wanting to be clear on the risk for management discussions. 
 Question 2: Right now in Splunk I see AES in use, but also RC4 being used, even involving systems that have support for AES128 and AES256. I think I've read that once we switch to W2K19 DCs this behavior will change, and the DCs will start negotiating with the highest encryption level available. Is that accurate? We want to work towards phasing out RC4, so if the above is true, we should immediately see a big drop in RC4 traffic after we swap out our DCs this summer.

 Built-in bot for online chat with customization options (desirable, but we can make our own).
 Customization (some kind of integration, apps or at least built-in functionality)
 Tools for metrics analysis (SLA, statistics, etc.).
  
We won't have voice support, so we plan to communicate via online chat only. Also in the support will work no more than 5 employees in shifts in a 24 by 7 mode. If someone is away for lunch, the bot has to help somehow and create a ticket, so that the client does not just sit there.

 SMTP soft linking (proxy address attributes and email field) - this created a second account if it synced at all) 
 Hard linking by setting azure identities immutable ID to the on prem object GUID by translating it from base 64…
 The GUIDS will not throw any errors on sync, it’s the duplicate UPN and SMTP:username fields that won’t sync and show duplicate errors.

 Last idea - export PST and remake.

 Do I have this right that I have to install one AADConnect per Tenant to make this happen? We have maybe 30 OU/domains to be potentially synced to individual Tenants. If this is the case do I need 30 instances of AADConnect? This does not sound right? But if this is the case what is best practices?
 Let me know if I have to clarify things. Thanks.

 It's common knowledge that switches forward broadcast/multicast Ethernet frames out on every port except on the one the frame was received on. This is described e.g. in Computer Networks: A Systems Approach Chapter 3.2.4
 However even though I have fulltext access to IEEE standards, my brain hurts when I try to understand how exactly this behaviour can be deducted from 802.1d, not to speak of 802.1Q. 
 Could someone point me to the relevant portions in the standards where exactly this is derived from?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've had a phishing campaign target users within our company, all the usual markers aren't present, so this hasn't been quarantined by our Email Gateway.
 Pretty much, each email sent comes from a different mail server (all "good / neutral" reputation), they're all different in content, but all have a "*.pdf" attached (no set naming scheme to these either).
 Each of the emails only goes to a few users so isn't being caught via "bulk" sending either. Obviously we've been adding the mail servers into the block lists along with the domains as they come in.
 We've had KnowBe4 running campaigns for years now, so our end users knew what to do (don't open anything, report it, etc.). We sent out an email to all users, just informing them of what is happening, and to be vigilant.
 I don't think much more can be done to prevent this, other than keep up training for users, keep them informed of threats (as we've done).
 All the mail servers aren't within our country and we don't do much business outside of this country, so I could restrict all inbound mail just to our country (then just allow through what's need when it's needed).
 I have got a support case open with our Email Gateway provider, as a few of these emails used the name of end users and should of been caught by "Impersonation Prevention" but it marked them as "Legitimate".
 Any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks

The new products SoGEA does not cover all sites, if you had a line that was DSL only you might be out of luck, and nothing comes with the SLA of EoFTTC or EFM without doubling the cost and going fibre leased line.
 I wonder what people are doing? Personally anything voice we are just shunting to mobile 3G/LTE, the data is going to have to be SoGEA, but we have already identified areas where the service level is reduced or simply no current replacement product meets the same spec.

 I am in need of some assistance with a project I am working on. I have been tasked with creating an automatic warranty checker for Dell servers, and I am hoping to use Nagios to achieve this. I have found an API for Nagios that was created in 2012, but unfortunately, it is no longer functional. I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with creating a Dell server warranty checker using Nagios and would be able to offer any guidance.
 The objective of this project is to create a system that will allow Nagios to self-check the Dell website by service tag and display the warranty status of the server in Nagios, or alternatively, send an email notification. This would help us keep track of the warranty status of our servers and allow us to take action before the warranty expires.
 I would appreciate any help or guidance on this matter, whether it be through pointing me in the direction of helpful resources, providing suggestions on how to tackle this project, or sharing personal experiences with similar projects.
 Thank you in advance for your assistance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an Ansible playbook that can modify the VLAN configuration of Cisco switch ports. Here's an example of the host_vars:
 interface:
 GigabitEthernet1/0/1:
 mode: trunk
 GigabitEthernet1/0/2:
 access_vlan: '100'
 mode: access
 voice_vlan: '200'
 stp_portfast: enable
 GigabitEthernet1/0/3:
 access_vlan: '100'
 mode: access
 voice_vlan: '200'
 stp_portfast: enable
 ...
 Here's the task, which works well and allows me to configure the ports by calling the 'port' tags:
 - name: assign access port
 cisco.ios.ios_l2_interfaces:
 config:
 - name: "{{item.key}}"
 mode: "{{item.value.mode | default (omit)}}"
 access:
 vlan: "{{item.value.access_vlan | default (omit)}}"
 voice:
 vlan: "{{ item.value.voice_vlan | default (omit) }}"
 state: merged
 with_dict: "{{ interface }}"
 when: (item.value.mode is defined and item.value.mode == 'access')
 tags:
 - port
 Let's say I want to make changes to G1/0/30. I can make the changes in host_vars, and run the play, however, as you know in Ansible, it will go through each port, validate them, and eventually make changes to G1/0/30. 
 The problem here is that it takes a long time to configure a single port, If I have a stack switch, can't even imagine, it will take forever.
 The time it takes to configure a single port using SSH CLI now takes no longer in ansible, which defeats the whole purpose of automation. This will get even trickier during a troubleshooting calls.
 So if anyone who has successfully used Ansible in their network, do you know how to deal with this situation?
 I am looking for a solution where I can invoke the playbook for only the specific interface. without so much change

 Example: The RTT between New York and San Francisco should theoretically be around 48ms. However, the actual figures observed are closer to 70ms.
 With this in mind, where is the attentional latency coming from, and is there a good "rule of thumb" multiplier that I can use to estimate latency? I'm aware that serialization & processing delay is a thing, but given today's interface speeds, I can't see how that could possibly add up to anything significant. Does the added latency come from the fiber optic medium itself? The fact that light is not traveling in a vacuum? Some sort of operation on the ROADMS?

We are testing some things in mobile to see if it works responsively. It was working fine until yesterday. All of a sudden the site redirects to some shady sites as soon as ii type in the url. It happens only onmobiles ghat too only on my wifi connected devices. Mobile data and laptops seem fine.
 I stopped the site entirely as I was worried and flushed out dns of my browser and changed router dns, password, etc. Still the problem is not resolved.
 Is my website hacked? If it is it must happen to all, other colleagues checked and it works fine there. It works fine on my tablet and laptops and over mobile network.
 Can I do anything to find the root cause?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there fellow networkers! I am running into a particular issue that I am researching a better solution. I am primarily a PON engineer so I am used to working in that space but as my ISP that I work for is transitioning away from Active E setups, besides for enterprise customers, and moving more to XGS-PON for connections, I am running into an issue with MDUs, mainly apartment complexes. 
 ​
 We install a 48 port L2 switch then through the CLI, apply traffic shapers accordingly to what the customer is paying for on that interface instead of installing a managed router or some kind of CPE equipment. This is great and all being fed from a Active E connection or even now a XGS ONT since the apartment complex doesn't want to run fiber to all the units and want to re-utilize all the copper connections so we install a managed switch. So far this works for a dedicated NOC tech to turn up or down or apply different traffic shapers to the interface but that generates a lot of tickets for work that I don't want them doing all day long but I can't necessarily teach the customer service or billing people to do those tasks. 
 ​
 Now we do run UNMS/UISP because we use it for managing GPON ONUs via UOLT, ERX, Air Cubes and other Ubiquiti products but I keep seeing stuff about the UISP Switch Pro being able to apply Traffic Shaper profiles and turn up/down interfaces with ease. Before I order one for testing, is it just as easy with the new CRM system to create a customer, apply a service plan and assign a port interface just in a similar fashion as the GPON ONUs? If so, that would alleviate a lot of manual work!

The company in question has over 20,000 employees and currently uses CommVault which can be very difficult to manage well. A lot of the general work is spent on maintenance and using tickets with CV to get things done. 
 The other part of the question is which solution would work with Salesforce the best. CommVault really lacks in features for SF and isn't even on the app exchange. I know cohesity just got a partnership with Ownbackup so that is good and something we are considering. 
 But from everyone's experiences what would be the recommendation?

 -Would like to be able to have a one "head end" device that could go into the facility network and then multiple endpoint devices for the different devices on the current 485 loop
 If this is possible with MoCa, what would be a good recommendation? Any Ideas would be appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m in an odd situation here. I’ve spent the last 15 years of my life buried in the CLI to become the best network engineer I could. I got my BS degree (bullshit degree I call it), I got my CCNA r/S, CCNA Voice, CCNP r/S, and I’m working to renew it into an CCNP Enterprise…. But I’m burnt out. 
 I work so much that it’s crumbled my personal/family life. I’ve also grown into an alcoholic over the years. I’ve worked the 12 step program but with the stress of my job – I keep going back to the boos. It’s time to make a change. 
 So I’ve been putting out apps for jobs that I’m essentially overqualified for – main reason is so I can go to work and not have to stress. I can set up a VLAN instead of design a whole VXLAN from scratch. I can make sure the link lights are up – instead of delve into the CLI for 3 hours trying to troubleshoot things down to the packet level… At least – this is my plan. 
 I have a final interview for a NOC 3 position. The pay is surprisingly good for a NOC job and based off what I learned in my second interview – this job should be a breeze. 
 So my strange question is – has anyone taken a step BACK from the hard charge “study everyday” mentality? If so – did it help your personal life? What’s it like working in the NOC from the perspective of a more senior guy? I ask because most NOC techs I’ve worked with were early career (justifiably so). I’ve never worked in a NOC but everywhere I’ve worked has had one – so I’m familiar with most duties. 
 I’m doing this to save my marriage, personal life, and get my shit back together – and I’m blessed in that the paycut is not all that bad since I’ll be a t3… No they haven’t given me an offer but I told them my bottom line number and they still called me back 1 hour later to do the final interview.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We started getting emails from staff about emails not getting received/delivered and noticed that MS Defender is blocking most valid emails, which are flagged as spam or phishing. 
 We added the domains and email addresses to the safe-sender lists (Policies & rules > Threat policies > Anti-spam policies > Anti-spam inbound policy > Allowed and blocked senders and domains) and also created and safe-sender lists via Exchange Admin > Mail flow > Rules and still valid emails added into the safe-sender list are still getting blocked.
 We enabled notification when emails are quarantined, and staff will have an option to "Review Message," "Request Release" and "Block Sender." We will get notified and have two ways of releasing the quarantined emails.
 ​
 Release
  
- This option will have an option to "Submit the message to Microsoft to improve detection (false positive)
 - Allow emails with similar attributes (URL, senders, etc.)
 - then you specify the "Remove allow entry" to 1, 7, 30 days, or a specific date
  
Approve release
  
- selecting this option "will send the message to Microsoft for analysis and evaluation."
  
It doesn't matter which option we select. Even adding to the safe-sender lists, valid emails are getting blocked. Are you experiencing the same issue with MS O365 Defender? Any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks

I come from a federal background where we had to have MFA on everything, and it didn't matter if we were on the internal network or accessing the network remotely. However at my new organization (which handles mostly banking clients) it seems the overall trend is no MFA for internal access to the domain, but only if the user is working remotely. Is this common? Is this best practice? I feel like MFA should be configured for external and internal but maybe I'm biased? What do you think?

We need further discussion to talk about kinds of access, and we discussed reasons for limiting how many people can make changes to SharePoint sites. 
 Overall, the in-person discussion went well, and I feel like this is back under control. 
 I appreciate everyone who had a thoughtful comment and offered good suggestions
 Original Post:
 This request came in yesterday. I told them we can't do that, but I'm still getting pressure. I've asked them what they're trying to do and exactly what kind of access they want, but that giving the HR director access to folders that could contain customer PII is a non-starter. The COO just changed the request to all Operations sites, which seems OK for the COO, but still not HR. 
 I've cited potential fine, lawsuits, and failing third-party investor due-diligence IT audits. 
 I have an informal meeting with them today and will hopefully get some insight into their goals, but as of now I have no idea why they want HR to have this access.
 Any thoughts?

 How do you handle accounts in your warehouses with people that are very very computer illiterate? I just went through our AD and we have about... 37 shared accounts.
 I am lost on how to transition these users to using their own logins due to how many people can use a single station - I'm most stuck on users not knowing how to switch accounts using the 'other accounts' option on the Windows logon screen.
 I've been at this new place for about 3 months, and while I am working on transitioning to running the department myself (currently just me and my boss who's transitioning to another field), my main goal during this first year is to clean things up and implement best practices. 
 Part of me wants to ask if there's ever any situation where shared accounts are okay, but at the end of the day there's 0 accountability if something happens on one of these computers.
 How do you guys handle these? KIOSK mode? Print out instructions at workstations on switching accounts?

One of the first things I noticed was that some of our locations had a firewall, while some of them did not. I got a firewall installed and site to site VPN set up at all our locations. Recently I became aware that some of our sites have a wireless network for tenants to use though the site's ISP. My first reaction is to remove all ISP wireless and setup a managed wireless infrastructure at each location.
 Am I overacting by adding firewalls with site to site VPN at all our locations and wanting to have all wireless networks at our locations be managed and using the same equipment that we use on our corporate wireless? Any idea of why they would not use firewalls at all locations? How would you handle the tenant wireless infrastructure?
 I am a team of 1 at my company and the person I took over for was not a technical person.

 We are having an issue where someone from, for example, 'john@superawesomeclient.com' sends an email to a distribution list, for example 'groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za' which I and a few others on 'myowndomain.com' (hosted on microsoft 365) are a member of, we wont get that message but john@superawesomeclient.com will get a NDR it will have this
  
Error DetailsError:550 5.7.360 Remote server returned message denied by administrative policy -> 550 Administrative prohibition - envelope blocked - https://community.mimecast.com/docs/DOC-1369#550 [ZgnzmELwMCC9bjqMvfWALQ.za9]Message rejected by:za-smtp-1.mimecast.co.za
  
Now other people on 'superawesomeclient.com' and 'fantasticclient.co.za' domains can send emails to me and others in my domain I get them no problem, but its is emails from 'groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za' is where my issue lays.
 Both the mentioned domains are on my 'allowed list', and I have both of those domains setup to bypass the built-in spam filters. I have even set the all the Mimecast server ip's (for South Africa that is) in my 'IP Allow list' from on our 'Connection filter Policy', but still emails from just the one account (groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za) by anyone on my domain (myowndomain.com).
 ​
 How can I go about resolving this and what would I need to show the people at 'fantasticclient.co.za' and their domain is 'whitelisted' so to speak if this is their issue?

When they send us emails, for whatever reason their emails come in as an attachment. We basically are getting an email from the sender, but there is no body in the email. The entire email is put into an outlook attachment (.msg file).
 I am not sure how to even properly search for this condition. Any thoughts on this? Anyone else seen this behavior before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're investigating using EVPN-BGP in our data center (100-200 servers, thousands of VMs in Openstack). Although I personally have been in the networking industry for awhile as a software engineer, I am going to need to heavily ramp up on BGP in general and try to learn these technologies from the ground up.
 Wondering with those that have some experience here whether setting these scenarios up in Eve-NG is possible/effective or whether just jumping into setting up the physical hardware is a better option.
 Appreciate any guidance here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some help commenting, analyzing, and criticizing different queuing models for some IoT interactions.
 ​
 Using the simulator MobileJINQS with support of the ON/OFF model, assuming that each ON/OFF model represented a mobile sender that uses various QoS settings for the transmission of messages and followed 4 experiments:
 ​
  
ON/OFF Model
  
* The server remains in the ON and OFF states for exponentially distributed time periods T_ON = T_OFF = 20 / 40 / 60s;
 * Messages get processed with a mean service demand D=0.125s
 * Messages arrive to the queue with a mean rate lambda varying from 0.05 to 4 messages/sec.
 This is the simulated curve of the mean response time for several lambda rates:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/GFtW39M.png
 ​
  
ON/OFF Model with QoS Features
  
* T_ON=T_OFF=20s
 * Mean service demand D=0.125s
 * Message arrival rate lambda varies from 0.05 to 3.9 messages/sec.
 ​
 On that basis, we had four experiments on, considering these QoS features:
 (1) Tau = 1, lifetime = infinity, and K = infinity
 (2) Tau = 1, lifetime = 30s, and K = infinity
 (3) Tau = 0.75, lifetime = infinity, and K = infinity
 (4) Tau = 1, lifetime = infinity, and K = 100
 ​
 For each of the four experiments, the ON/OFF model was run 10 times and we got the following curve, response time with respect to arrival rate lambda:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/lo3SaXP.png
 ​
 As well as sucess rate with respect to arrival rate:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/qF35p07.png
 ​
  
Nonpreemptive priority and multiclass simulation model
  
​
 K classes were defined with different arrival lambda_k and service rates mu_k for each class.
 ​
 Depending on the values of lambda_k and mu_k, the system can be saturated.
 ​
 Let p be the server utilization. The queue remains unsaturated when p < 1.
 ​
 We got the curvers of different server utilization, first one was p=0.69 and classes C=19; and second was p=0.89 and classes C=9
 ​

 It would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you plan to move towards passwordless via smart cards, passwords are still required for initial onboarding plus the users may need to access certain things via their AD credentials that don’t support smart card authentication.
 It would not be practical for the users to have to call the help desk every time they need to access something via password and, if they have a known password always available to them, it defeats some of the security of using a smart card since the smart card authentication can be bypassed if the password is compromised.
 What are you doing to give SCRIL users password access for onboarding and to authenticate to resources that don’t recognize smart cards?

 It appears that the main advantage of Cloud Trust is that it allows you to deploy while avoiding requiring having a PKI in your environment. If your environment stills needs a PKI for other reasons, that advantage goes away.
 Doesn’t key trust have better RDP compatibility and also allows you to use “run as” where you cannot with cloud trust?

 Two days ago some of them notified me that the print preview takes literally ages to load. I stayed after work to check and it not only takes more than two minutes to load but it also crashes chrome 1/3 times.
 I scraped the internet for a solution and tried a bunch of stuff and ended up fixing it by manually installing new Post script drivers on all 10 machines for all 3 office printers.
 The preview now works without crashing Chrome but it still takes about 5 seconds to load (a big improvement over the 2 minutes it used to take). Naturally everyone is still complaining because according to them it used to be instantaneous before.
 Im all out of ideas here so any tips would be really appreciated. One option is obviously to just use another browser but it’s an unpopular option as “they’re all really used to chrome and how it looks”
 Pls help.

 And I have been noticing when I push the system to do heavy tasks that the CPU performance at 90% CPU load across all threads hovers around 3.45Ghz, I never see it hit 3.60Ghz or its boost of 3.90Ghz. 
 The bios settings are set to default, Speedstep and TurboBoost are enabled and the bios is on the latest version. 
 I wonder if its a Dell thing or a Microsoft Windows 11 thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys
 I try to compare two arrays, but I dont get it. Why this is not working? I runs through, but doesnt add the values to the arrays. 
 The $AdGroupNames is an array. The $AdGroupName is an PSCustomObject, maybe thats the problem? How to solve this?
 $AdGroupNames = Get-ADGroup -Filter * -SearchBase "ou=......" | Select-Object Name
 ​
 #compare existing distribution groups with required DGs.
 $ExistingDGs = @(Get-DistributionGroup | Select-Object Name)
 ​
 #DGs which will stay
 $DGstay = @()
 #DGs which will be deleted
 $DGdelete = @()
 #new DGs
 $DGnew = @()
 ​
 foreach ($AdGroupName in $AdGroupNames){
 if ($AdGroupName -in $ExistingDGs){$DGstay += $AdGroupName}
 else{$DGnew += $AdGroupName}
 }
 ​
 foreach ($ExistingDG in $ExistingDGs){
 if ($ExistingDG -in $AdGroupNames){$DGdelete += $ExistingDG}
 }

 I see I can make myself powershell script and scheduled task, but all I want is having daily snapshots for the last 5 days.
 >inb4 do b backups
 They are done both of important data inside and of the entire VMs with veeam.
 But I just want daily snapshots to have bit of extra automated "backup" when I am updating stuff inside, knowing I can do so without extra step of doing snapshot beforehand. Which is easier and faster to revert to than backups.

 im a bit stuck and could need some input from you:
 We have a Windows Server 2016 RDS. Since last Week users complaining that they cant open some PDF Files. I got the ticket now from my colleague to help him.
 I analyzed the problem and found that all files that wont work have the DataStream ZoneIdentifier tag set that they are from the internet and could harm the system. If i rightclick the file it show the info box "this file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer".
 So far so good. If i click on allow and therefore remove the Zone Identifier the File opens with a double click. 
 I checked other file types aswell. The same Problem with word files, and image files. So its not a application problem. It seems to be a windows problem.
 If i change the internetoptions-> security -> Internet Zone -> Start unsecure applications and files : from confirm (recommended) -> to activate (not secure) the problem is gone also. But i dont like to change this setting.
 What could cause this problem? Can you help me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the 2012R deadline approaching I upgraded everything to 2022, and rebuilt out DC's in the process. I was ready to decommission the final 2012R2 DC but when testing via a shutdown, I experienced an outage. 
 Our intranet, hosted on Google Cloud on Ubuntu, requires a sign in with an active directory credential to access (email address + password via LDAP). Despite changing the IP of the VM's DNS server to match our new DC's (one on GCP and one on prem), the moment I turn off the old DC is the moment authentication on this server fails, and staff instead get an "Internal Server Error" page from apache. 
 Digging into the apache config, I can see the authentication is using LDAP, with the following section;
 ## Active Directory AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthLdapBindDN readonly@int.domain.net AuthLdapBindPassword AuthLdapBindURL ldap://int.domain.net:3268/?userPrincipleName?sub 
 Three things about this;
 1 - Even though the AD account it's using to authenticate has the absolute minimum access, I don't like how the password is stored in plain text. Is this a requirement for such a setup?
 2 - What configures that ldap:// and how do I get it to point to the new DC's? Is this configured vía our public DNS instead? Or is not DNS at all?? 
 3 - Doing some digging online I discovered that it's possible to "automatically authenticate" via their user account if the credentials match (meaning they don't have to enter them in). Is this only possible on Windows/will it break a manual username/password entry? We have some Macs around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some recent less than desirable experiences at my job, I reached out to a recruiter. They have passed along a job opportunity to be the IT Manager at a Non Profit for me to look at. I would be the sole IT person onsite and the description lists everything from on boarding new employees for training to writing and implementing policy. Apparently there is a significant level of vendors leveraged right now, but it still seems as though the job might be punching a bit above it's weight class in terms of expectations and salary. The network size is approximately 100 end user devices according to the recruiter (computers). 
 What are people's experiences working in an environment like this? Is there a chance it could be good? Or will it be an extremely overworked shit show? 
 I will also add I have previously been a network admin and systems engineer and feel as though my only weak point skillset wise will be the HIPPA stuff. I do have experience working in a heavily controlled and audited environment so I think it will be more so based around learning the new intricacies VS entirely new concepts. In the listing they specifically call out that they will send people to training to ensure their skillset stays sharp. 
 The salary is more than livable (85k) as it will be a great resume builder and it's similiar to my current role as an engineer. I wouldn't be taking a pay cut.

 User logs in, 802.1x auth occurs with user’s account (EXAMPLE\jdoe) and EX3400 dhcp process deletes the existing DHCP binding, resulting in Windows machine getting a new IP address.
 Desired behavior is no IP change.
 This only occurs when the machine is directly connected to the switch running dhcp-local-server. When machine is connected to an EX3400 switch trunked to the switch providing DHCP, this does not occur, as the DHCP process has no awareness of the auth change.
 Any ideas of how to get dhcp-local-server to ignore 802.1x auth events?

 There's a reset button that doesnt appear to be able to wipe this thing back to factory settings, or it doesn't disclose the additional steps needed to do so in the docs.
 How are the 1k's able to beset if CLI is not an option? I'm not a hardcore network guy, I mostly deal with Meraki gear... so sorry if this is a dumb question

 I don't know, but when I see these unless its a tiny company I feel like either the company is behind the times and doesn't want to upgrade, too cheap to buy its own domain or the IT department gave up a long time ago trying to make any changes to the company.

 It always makes me hesitant to apply for these companies.
 Anybody else get that feeling or am I just paranoid ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situation:
 ServerA <-> FW <- IPSec VPN -> FW (NAT) <==> public internet
 Issue: some clients have connection issues with ServerA , apparently only when sending larger files. The public IP address is NATted on the first firewall.
 When a Linux client enables mtu probing (echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mtu_probing ), there are no issues.
 So it is some kind of MTU issue. I ran a couple of ping tests from a client, and I am getting weird results:
 ​
  
 ping -s <size> <ip address> ping -D -s (size> <ip address> 
  
 64: OK 64: OK 
  1394: OK 1394: OK 
  1395: No ICMP reply 1395: NO ICMP reply 
  1396: No ICMP reply 1396: NO ICMP reply 
  1397: OK 1397: NO ICMP reply 
  1464: OK 1464: NO ICMP reply 
  1465: OK 1465: fragmentation needed (Code 4 reply) 
  1472: OK 1472: fragmentation needed (Code 4 reply) 
  1473: No ICMP reply 1473: message too long ( ping: sendto: Message too long ) ; probably from OS, don't see anything in Wireshark 
  1495: No ICMP reply (Wireshark: Fragmented IP protocol) 1495: message too long 
 
 When initiating a TCP connection to ServerA, serverA responds with a MSS of 1384 .
 Downloading a 10.000 bytes file from ServerA works as expected.
 Can any point me in the right direction where to look ? ServerA isn't in our control and is difficult to get any traces from. On the left FW there are no rules, it only terminates the VPN connection. The right side of the VPN and its FW is in our control and allows some tcp-ports and ICMP. MTU size of the interfaces on the FW are 1500.
 Especially the difference in behaviour around size 1397, where normal pings suddenly start working again until 1473. This differs per connection, on my normal home wifi I see above behaviour, when connecting to a 4G hotspot (either tethered or via wifi to a 4G router), there are no ICMP replies from 1395 onwards. And pings with DF-bit set never return the Code 4 reply, so that might be filtered in 4G networks.

 Best practices are certainly not being followed and I'm just now digging into how to get us to a good spot. I've recently enabled URL and Application monitoring for our lan to wan policy. App monitoring is requesting deep inspection, but it seems the impact of doing so must be considered.
 - Any advice for whether to enable deep inspection or not?
 - Should antivirus be enabled on our lan-to-wan policy with out-of-the-box defaults? What about DNS filter?
 - Can I setup alerts to fire when a "monitored" category URL is hit? Or can you only fire alerts on a blocked URL?
 What would be your recommendations if you had a "new" Fortigate firewall dropped in your lap? I'm willing to consider some of the subscriptions Fortinet offers, such as Forticloud/Fortianalyzer, if the value is there.
 The current goal is to increase visibility into user activity. We don't regularly monitor, but in the event we want to check on someone's activity, we want that ability. Right now I'm struggling to glean meaningful info from our App/URL monitoring and can't find a way to filter by categories (such as adult categories or suspicious/blocked URLs).
 I'm going to be taking this one step at a time, so any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Everything sounded like a lot of added value for no cost (since AT&T pays them directly). Is this too good to be true? Someone will help me manage all my AT&T woes and I don't have to pay a penny? What are the pros/cons? Interested to hear your experience.
 Edit: an AT&T Solutions Provider (not Service, my mistake) is different than AT&T itself. This is someone who works as a middle man between you and AT&T. It’s like they know AT&T is such a PITA to work with and they help you navigate that. Anyone have experience with that? I know AT&T is horrible to work with. Trust me, I know! That’s why I’m wondering if this service would be worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/networking
 I'm working with a client that's exploring options for SASE and SDWAN for around 200 branch sites. They don't run redundant internet circuits at the majority of these sites, so I have steered them away from expensive SDWAN solutions to accompany their SASE purchase; I don't see any value in branch SDWAN appliances if they are single-circuit for the foreseeable future.
 My question is: has anyone out there found a relatively low cost, IPSec capable, cloud-managed router with some level of enterprise support available? A good low touch provisioning workflow would be a big bonus as well. These devices would strictly be used to feed traffic from branch sites into the selected SASE solution via IPSec tunnel. We would either do a static default on the branch routers, or distribute a default via an IGP. The SASE solution will double as their WAN in this case, for branch-to-branch connectivity.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since COVID and the new hybrid workplace, I've seen a lot of turnover in many enterprises.
 Often times, senior network engineers move on and are replaced with junior engineers who lack experience and foundational knowledge. Other times, senior engineers are replaced with new senior engineers who have the background knowledge, but need to learn the company-specific implementations. 
 I'm looking for ideas on how to skill-up these new hires, and wondering what others feel are some of the best methods? 
 A few things I've found to work:
 Shadowing/Co-Piloting changes - Junior shadows the senior on a change, then junior takes the wheel and senior co-pilots the change. This is sort of like the "I do/we do/you do" concept in education.
 Good documentation/topologies/reference materials - Having plans of the network topology, where to find things, etc.
 Leveraging TAC - Pass off issues that require the involvement of TAC can help learn basic troubleshooting commands
 Trial by fire - Throw to the wolves on resolving tickets, etc. Basically sink or swim.
 ​
 ​
 Does your organization do anything special to ramp up new hires? For example, a Wiki or handbook or something that goes over all the different equipment you use with reference configs and topologies? Do you put new engineers through 3rd party training?
 Or do you mostly rely on their previous experience and expect on-the-job training to cover the rest?

 I get lots of different projects thrown at me and I’m feeling overwhelmed but I want to grow my career. 
 I’ve written two applications that the company uses daily and made our business flow much faster. I’ve implemented a ticketing system, enrolled field user devices with inTune, working on migrating our ERP to be cloud based, fully took over helpdesk, comfortable with Active Directory and GPOs, set them up with SharePoint, on-boarded all devices with defender ATP, and more. 
 Now they know that I can program pre chatGPT, they want me to make these other complicated business applications. All while I’m trying to earn my admin title.
 Not sure what to focus on and I’ve mentioned that IT admin and programmer are two full time jobs. I prefer sys admin over programming any day. 
 I can probably cruise here and learn a lot on the sys admin side but I’m by myself and feel like an imposter when talking to the MSP some days. 
 Anyone else in a similar boat? Is one year experience enough to apply elsewhere? Do I keep on keeping on and rely on MSP if I’m an idiot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a little off topic but hopefully some folks here have worked in hardware or done their own home labs before:
 I am being offered some retired server equipment (that I very much want!) and a half-height mobile server rack/cart thing. Any advice on the best way to transport it? 
 The server rack cart will fit in my SUV if it's on its side, but that's only reasonable if it's empty. The server equipment (including a nice rack-mount UPS) is quite heavy and will fill the cart, I don't imagine that could reasonably be lifted even with 4 people (and probably not ideal to have that stuff laying on its side?).
 I have a trailer with a ramp I could borrow, but the trailer has like a whopping 2 leaf-springs of suspension so anything in there would be bounced and rattled like crazy for my 1-hour drive home over shitty roads.
 I can borrow a pickup truck, but how to get the loaded cart up into the truck? (There is no lift onsite, I have a tractor at home and could easily unload it, but getting it into the truck is a challenge). 
 Short of renting a UHaul, any ideas? Thanks in advance!

 Long time lurker, first time asking for some help.
 Our company has started offering customers SAML as a login method recently. Naturally I was tasked with setting it up customers, because I have a lot of spare time as the only IT Admin for a company of 250 users. /s
 We (Service Provider) use Okta, customers vary between Google Workspace, Okta, Azure AD for IdP. I've got no issue setting up Okta or Google Workspace customers, I use those daily, got 'em covered, but Azure is where I am struggling. I figured out how to set up a SAML app, and it's working with a SP initiated flow, but user attributes aren't mapping which long term will cause issues. All I get is their email, but also need to get firstName and lastName to map.
 If anyone could direct me on how to properly map attributes from Azure AD to Okta via SAML it would be greatly appreciated!
 ​
 On a side note, I am creating documentation on how to set everything up on both our and customer side and got approval from my manager and the CSM manager that once documentation is ready, this will become CSM responsibility.

 I setup a reverse proxy in golang to that same proxy-ssl.webflow.com address and use it for everything except that one static file. But it doesn’t work. Every hit thru the proxy is a 404 this way. 
 What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone!
 I was doing some research on IT companies in my local area and came across a job at a company called Unisys. The pay for the work seems very good, requires traveling to customers to repair computer hardware and troubleshoot primarily Dell computers at ~$24/hr plus mileage. The majority of the support appears to be based out of Asia, but the position requires work local to where I live. 
 I've seen mixed reviews online with people saying that it is an MSP company, and it should not be worked with while others say that it is good pay and experience with hard work. I currently make $18/hr full time, but I am looking to branch into the field of IT. This seems like a good opportunity for me, but I need some 2nd opinions. 
 Has anyone here worked with Unisys in the past? If so, what was your experience like working for them? Would you recommend them?

Could not get to file shares or admin shares from any other system. Eventually blew out the shares and rebuilt another cluster with new everything. Total production nightmare recreating permissions, shares etc. Finally got everything working again yesterday and a little sleep.
 Today, a different set of servers is showing the same symptoms. All of the sudden administrators are unable to access the admin shares on remote servers. I am at a loss and could really use some advice.

I've done a few Python and Bash scripts to automate a few tasks, but I've never done proper enterprise level coding before. I barely even know how to use Git. Making the transition is definitely a daunting task. Anyone make a transition like this before that has some advice for me?

 The new office will connect by Wireless WAN to the main office WiFi network and have their own LAN and wifi there(separate business). There will be just a couple of workstations, two printers and mobile phones.
 ​
 I assume these routers should have two WiFi adapters in order to accommodate two different WiFI tasks? Is anything else I need to be aware of? Also if you have models to suggest that would be highly appreciated.

 Is there anything that can check against a constantly updated database of compromised passwords (and is also easy to deploy) without the administrator having to download a huge file of hashes every time to update it?
 This is for on-prem AD obvsiouly. We are also putting into place Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server as well, but in my testing, I've noticed some passwords it would accept that Netwrix found in the compromised database, so would still like something that can do a check against leaked passwords.

 If this isn’t an appropriate question for this sub - sorry.
 Recently I was tasked to create a registry for gear such as keyboards, desktop docks, and perhaps even ergo mouse pads due to the fact that many of these items tend to walk away. The issue is that these stationary items are at desks in a hybrid environment where the employees book their desk on a week by week basis. Normally I would just have everyone sign for their issue. But that’s not feasible with this work arrangement. 
 Not really sure what to do to make users accountable in this environment. 
 Any recommendations?

 I'm not sure if this is the most accurate sub to post this on but I couldn't really find an active sub that was more closely related. 
 At my work, I need to create (with the help of a few others) a range of computers to test cyber threat emulation and defense on. The budget for this range is exactly $0 and we have to just use a bunch of old laptops we have lying around. This kind of throws virtualizing all of the devices out as an option. Currently, we plan to run the exploits which will infect all of the laptops and then manually re-install Windows on each one, this is super time-consuming so I'm trying to think of how we can do this in a more automated way.
 I've never done anything like this before and it is also way outside of the scope of my job but it's gotta get done. Some thoughts I've had is having a virtual machine on top of the host machine that we create a snapshot of and somehow make the connection within the network only reach the VM rather than the host machine.
 Does anyone have any advice or can point me in the right direction for how I can get started with this?

 But the question is
  
How do I make this available for all machines?
 Does it have to be set locally or when I set them up?
 Currently we have an admin account on the machine, but obviously it had been wiped by the senior user
 Would this other user option give us the way to remove the old style admin account?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As most of us know - or will get to know soon enough, unlocking security features with some software vendors, are usually locked behind extremely high price tags.
 As per default, if you want to add a piece of software, and want to be compliant with just the basic GDPR or ISAE on security, the "enterprise"-license is the only way forward.
 With cyberattacks being one of the largest threats to organizations, should these features not by law, be included in even the smallest level of licensing?
 I manage quite a few licenses for a medium size company, and everyone who have tried to enlighten management about why we should pay for the Porche instead of the Fiat (no flame), knows how hard you sometimes have to fight and fail for that. Even given the possible security risks it entails.
 What are your thoughts on the subject, in terms of making it a law instead of a moneysink? Would it be possible? What would be the argument for it not happening? What would be the punchline that sold it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I need your help with something. I want to set up a Teams channel where my colleagues can vote daily for our lunch spot. This process seems to take about an hour a day and its really hurting productivity.
 What's the best way to make this happen automatically? I'm open to using Teams, Outlook add-ins, excel macro, Power Automate flows, or bots - whatever works best. 
 Also, I want to keep track of who's voted and share the results in an Excel file. Any suggestions on how to make that happen?
 Some of the methods i tried were using voting bots in MS Teams, but haven't found any which meets my needs: - export results to file so we can add orders to same files and keep track of money flow.
 I also tried creating re-occurring flow in which MS Teams connected with MS Forms file, but that proven to be impossible for me.
 Thanks for your help, and looking forward to your suggestions!

 There were no changes on the veeam side of things and respect to backup jobs. There were some routine updates applied to several of the VMs. The hypervisor hosts themselves had not been updated in a while, out of an abundance of caution has we are preparing to replace this cluster. 
 So at first my thoughts were this is a cluster issue. And for sure there are authentication failures on each note of the cluster even though I verified the accounts are not locked out and are the same accounts that have been in use for years.

 So my business finally requires some techs to be on call during afterhours. Most of the time they just need to be on call incase our app server goes down/network issues. nothing to do 99% of the time. I have been doing thing myself and have taken maybe 3 calls in the last 6 months, but Im not about to ask other techs todo this so I want to pay them and add it to their contract.
 I was thinking a lower flat rate and then a higher rate per call. What would be a fair $ amount for the flat rate and then higher rate per call in the industry in the moment?
 Am in Australia, Sydney
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I'm 8 years on the networking field at a European service provider, I gain quite a lot of experience during this time, did CCNP, CCNA Security, JNCIA, Silver Peak certifications and now working with Juniper's CSO and SSR SD-WAN solutions. 
 To be honest in the last 3 years I didn't became a fan of SDWAN nor did I got interested in the Cloud Solutions. Lately I have some free time and I would like to learn new things and do some certifications, but I'm not sure which way to go. 
 From one side I'm planning to do a Linux certification: I have general knowledge I picked up during my work, but it would be nice to have a more in-depth understanding in the system. I think it's still the foundation of IT. Which certification would you recommend? CompTIA or LPI?
 From the networking side, first I was thinking going for a Cisco or Juniper certification, but then I found Wireshark exam. Every now and then we hit problems where packet analysis is necessary and I only have basic knowledge in that, but once the data is gathered by others it's fun to solve the issue by completely understanding the traffic behavior. 
 So I did check this WCNA certification, but to be honest it feels a bit like an abandoned exam. The books are outdated and their website as well. What is your opinion on WCNA?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 We have been having some issues lately with outlook losing connection for some people in the company. It just sometimes loses connection randomly, and it's not really something people notice right away, so sometimes an e-mail will just be stuck for a whole day. So a lot of people have swapped to browser since the issue does not seem to appear there.
 Some more info on the issue.
 There can be days between occurrence
 It seems the only way to fix this is restarting the pc.
 Multiple people are impacted (Two guys with completely new workstations)
 ​
 I've tried all the common fixes.
 Check Connectivity and Mailbox Server Status. The first thing to do is check your system's network status.
 Check Work Offline Status.
 Restart Outlook in Safe Mode
 Fix Certificate Issue
 Create New Outlook Profile.
 Rebuild Outlook Data File.
 ​
 I've been going through a SaRA Advanced Diagnostic file and found this event log. I was thinking the credentials being rejected might be causing some of the issues.
 The BITS service provided job credentials in response to the UNIDENTIFIED authentication challenge from the Outlook.office365.com server for the microsoft Outlook offline address book xxxxxxxxxxxx transfer job that is associated with the following URL:/OAB/xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/oab.xml. The credentials for the S-1-5-21-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx user were rejected.
 ​
 If anyone has had this issue before, or might know a fix. Please guide me. All help is appreciated.
 ​
 Cheers guys

 I’m just very confused and the documentation didn’t specify and Eve ng seems insistent on preferring videos over text documentation.

 The first connection goes great. I am prompted to enter my Microsoft account, password, and complete a number matching MFA request. However, all subsequent connections over rdp are just allowed and signed in automatically.
 Is there a proper way to enforce this authentication and mfa requirement everytime from the server (AAD Joined device) side?

I am working on turning it into a truenas box but keep running into an issue. I want to add a dual 10g nic and 8 port sata card in the spare ports on the riser card. My issue is that they are not being recognized. The lights come on but they are not seen in bios or truenas. There was already a sata card installed in one of the ports that work but adding anything new does not seem to work. That card was already there. I am new to riser cards and unsure what to do next. Below are some troubleshooting steps I have taken.
  
Swap in the new sata card into the working port..... guess what... it works.... so I know that slot accepts anything. The other slots do not work on that riser card.
 
Reset bios... nothing changed. The other riser card is not accepting anything. Still just that 1 slot on that 1 riser card.
 
Enabled and disabled almost everything in bios. It never sees the new card on any of the other slots on that riser card or the other riser card. Just that one slot on that one riser card.
 
 Thank you for any help... I want this to replace my current usb hard drives asap...
 Edit 1: in the bios it talks about 2a and 2c being enabled. I turned them to disabled and the intel raid card stopped working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So have a bit of a problem. I'm using a progam called winsel by sentinel gates to run gates at a facility. The application is pretty basic and the driver contains two parts. 
 The first part is a com port. It needs vcp enabled. The second part is a usb device. The driver for this device is not on the internet and is installed from a directory.
 The problem occurs when windows update updates the system. The com port disappears and the gate program fails to connect. The only way to fix it when it gets like this is to uninstall and reinstall the driver.
 I've tried disabling driver updates but that doesn't seem to fix the problem. I'm not sure why but windows update seems to be poking around with devices in a way that breaks the system.

 I've been at a MSP for about 4 years now and I over see most of network infrastructure for clients. I came from a large enterprise that was a Cisco shop, since I was pretty new when I worked at this larger corporation I never got into the weeds of ISE. Now being in the industry for some years know I wanted to see if anyone had thoughts on learning Cisco's ISE platform. 
 I have a cluster of R620's in my lab and I decided to spin up a ISE VM and connect it to my GNS3 lab, so all the setup of ISE makes sense to me connecting to a AAA server, utilizing 802.1x. I just wanted to get some opinions on if its really worth it to learn this platform, currently none of my MSP's clients use this however long term I'm looking to do network administration for a hospital. It seems (from my view) that its more beneficial to learn ISE if you utilize it but its not worth learning like other core concepts like CCNA, AWS etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says I have a set of workstations at work with an unusual setup. These workstations are a 911 dispatch center and each station consists of 3 separate PCs, 5 monitors (2 PCs with 2 each nad the 3rd with just 1 monitor), all connected together with a type of KVM switch that allows users to control each machine with just one keyboard and mouse and have the desktops act as if they are all on one machine.
 The KVM device is called an Adder CCS controller and the way it functions is each machine is connected to this controller via USB and the kb/mouse connect to it. The controller allows you to move the mouse from one screen to another but in doing so switches the input of both kb & mouse to the corresponding PC. The reason why we have this odd setup instead of just consolidating the functions to one PC is that we do not own two of the PCs as they are provided by external entities to be used with their specific software product.
 This all works perfectly fine on 3 of the 4 stations but the 4th has had literally everything replaced and it continued to cause the mouse to randomly jump around, the browser windows to refresh or close and lose any info that had bene typed in, and other odd ball issues. Currently we have it setup where the one PC that had the odd issues completely separated from the controller and other systems but this is not ideal as it requires the use of two sets of kb/mouse.
 Has anyone used a setup like this before and if so do you have a recommendation for a replacement product? A traditional KVM or USB splitter is not an option as they cannot rely on needing to use a button to switch inputs, nor is a USB hub as they need the kb/mouse to only function on one screen at a time.
 So far the only thing I have been able to find is software products but we would prefer not to use that and stick with a hardware physical connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a small company that provide CCTV systems to customers. We are currently in the process of upgrading our systems and I have been tasked with finding a way to setup our IP cameras on a VLAN using a "router behind a router". The equipment I have to work with is an IP camera (HikVision), a Ruijie router, connected to the office router and a Ruijie switch. The setup we currently have goes:
 Office router -> Ruijie router -> Ruijie POE switch -> IP camera
 What we are trying to do is set the camera up so that the office router could be on a network for example 192.168.1.1
 and the camera could be setup on 192.168.2.1 but still connect to the internet as it requires internet to be viewed remotely. I have managed to set this up fairly easily however, we also want to possibly avoid any rogue connections being able to access the office network if they managed to break onto the "cameras network". I am not entirely sure if this is possible as obviously the camera needs to access the internet. Right now, when connected to the Vlan that the camera is on (192.168.55.1), I am still able to access everything on the office network (192.168.1.1). Is there a way to avoid this?
 We also are trying to see if there is a way to access the camera wirelessly through being connected to the office network, however, again, I feel this may not be possible as right now, I need to be connected directly to the Ruijie router through ethernet to access the camera.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 Our standard naming is Site-closet id-(a-z)-(1-48)
 This is pretty simple to find in the closet, but horrible to find in the field.
 I've considered room names in a drop, but that can change. As time goes on, and more runs go in for more devices, we'll find a drop A-12 raise C-48.
 I was hoping to learn if anyone here has a program that we can load up drawings and update this information of where drops are. Pin point high or walls etc..
 It sure would beat a spreadsheet that needs to be update and is then forgotten about in a year's time.

bytes 80h - 93h is serial number (ASCII)
 bytes 94h, 95h are set to 00h
 bytes 96h - 9Dh is date code (ASCII)
 bytes 9Eh - FFh are a mystery to me
  
Small problem is that serial number and date code are at two positions. At standard positions in A0h block and at H3C (HP) specific positions in A2h block, page 02. If I insert module to "generic" switch, informations from A0h block are read. If I insert module to H3C/HP switch, i get informations from A2h block. If I change serial number and/or date code in A2h block, H3C/HP switch don't identify module as HP compatible any moreSomewhere is some checksum / hash.
 My question is - know anyone exact structure of data in A0h block at addresses 60h - 7Fh and in block A2h (page 02h) at addresses 80h - FFh? Is there a SFP module code with another structure that will work in switch HP/H3C A5800?
 Thanks,
 Zbynek

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://i.ibb.co/nwcNPx1/opengearlte.png
 I inherited an OpenGear device that has an active LTE card in it. It is currently at a remote site with no technical hands. The site topology is shown in the above screenshot. I have not previously configured or deployed these devices.
 The OpenGear device is attached to a random port on the site's core switch (a Cisco 2960X). The switch has no dynamic or static routes configured, just a default gateway upstream to the FortiGate.
 This site regularly has outages with its current ISP. I was wondering if it is possible in these failure scenarios to route internet traffic out the OpenGear device's LTE connection automatically?
 The other potential rub - according to the OpenGear device, the SIM card is using a "private" public IP, meaning a VPN tunnel is required to access it.
 Thanks, in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a newbie question here. Sorry if this is a too simple question for this forum.
 I get data packets
  
Have a header and payload and trailer 
 Header has routing information (source/destination IP address, type, number)
 Payload is the actual Data
 Trailiure is vary between protocols but is generally used for (Cyclic) Redundancy Checks (CRC)
 
 The data packets are all given a number before they are sent.
 The computer uses these numbers to put the information back together in the right order (they can travel different routes over the internet and arise out of sequence.)
  
I also get protocols are a set of rules and various places talk about them being a set of rules governing how information travels across the internet but is it not really the packets that do this? Are protocols maybe more about defining the data packets and how they are used/unpacked?
 I am trying to understand this at a high level to teach computing at a secondary school. I worked in IT for many years and have never had to understand the details of this.

 When looking for our next firewall I'd like to have a feature where I can assign specific VLANs to different groups of VPN users. For instance, when internal sales team members remotely connect they are assigned an IP address from VLAN 666 and when accounting team members remotely connect they are assigned an IP address from VLAN 123. 
 If I were looking for devices that can do this, what is the name of the feature would I be looking for? Is it something that firewalls do or is this more along the lines of a needing a dedicated device, like a VPN concentrator?
 Finally, as this is still in the planning phase, are there any VPN-as-a-service offerings that can do this?

When talking to the users, we're finding that they're not clicking on anything in the emails, but still failing the click through test. If it was just a handful, we'd say "users be users", but they swear up and down they're not, and when we look in KnowBe4, the logged IP isn't from our range and shows as owned by MS. We're starting to wonder if the MS anti-spam is testing out the links differently than before which is causing the failures. Anyone else seeing similar or have any thoughts?

We currently have the PC's directly patched into a cisco router which is running a EZVPN connection from a Cisco ASA we have specifically for this. We like this setup because the PC is always connected to the states network not needing to use a remote client software like any connect. 
 The problem is these routers are going EOL soon and we would like a more cost efficient solution vs buying more routers that serve just this one purpose. Any ideas how we can go about a different solution? Should we move back to a AnyConnect profile and just tell the users they have to log into every time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just had my umpteenth meeting about the above topic. There's a view among the exec team that having someone manually go through the shared drives for each department would be too time-consuming and that there's a technological approach that would eliminate most of the grunt work by automatically categorising the various files (i.e. by identifying PII content, for example).
 I know there are tools that can do this - we've looked at them in the past - but my take is that the grunt work still needs to be done. All you've really done is come up with a way to prioritise what you look at first.
 - someone needs to check the files that are identified as PII to confirm that they contain PII.
 - someone needs to check the files that haven't been identified as PII to confirm that they don't contain PII.
 In both cases someone needs to decide whether or not the files need to be kept, or if they need to be deleted in line with data retention policies.
 Am I thinking about this the wrong way? Is there an approach that I'm not considering?

 Basically what's going on is when exporting prefixes that exist already in my BGP table to a target VRF and giving it a new extcommunity , for whatever reason not all the prefixes are getting the community that they've been specified for. I'm using "send-community additive" in the route-map
 ...jist of config looks like this;
 ip prefix-list yy_TO_xx
 seq 5 permit 10.59.10.0/24
 seq 10 permit 10.69.10.0/24
 etc
 Route-map yy_TO_xx_RT
 match ip address prefix-list yy_TO_xx
 set extcommunity RT::11111:2100 additive
 ​
 ** the first prefix gets the community but the second one doesn't. Each prefix already has an existing standard community & excommunity, per my bgp table
 The prefixes that aren't getting the additive community aren't getting leaked into the target vrf
 ​
 Would appreciate some insight as to what the issue might be , from your experiences with BGP communities and vrf leaking .

 We have issues reaching the last machines, and would like to block them from running the bad version, thus forcing them to call servicedesk to get help. WDAC we can deploy with Defender - So that would likely by a good solution. Not sure if GPOs are alwayes applied on road warriors.

 For example, i setup isolated environment (container) for developer to work on his web project, create user "someuser123" with ssh/sftp access. But for proper work of web-server files must belongs to www-data user, not even group. If i change owners to www-data - problem with uploading files. Some devs didn't know how to change file owners, so its constantly small problems and delays.
 How can dev upload files from "someuser123" via ftp\sftp without manually change then for www-data user ?
 Make user root ?
 Run web-server\php-manager\ets from "someuser123" ?
 Or there is proper solution for this situation ?

For example, assume I put a vault in compliance mode, let the grace period expire and my data retention is set to min 5 days and max 10 days. I understand I cannot delete backups or modify retention ever. But if I cease making backups will all the backups in the vault eventually expire and delete? Hope my question makes sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, sorry if this is a stupid question. I've been thrown into this by my ankles and I'm having to learn a lot really fast so I'm making mistakes left and right.
 I'm trying to get an SNMP walk of a Juniper firewall. I know that in order for your SNMP walks to "resolve" the OIDs (ie, say "SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0" instead of "iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0"), you need to give SNMPWALK.exe a set of MIBs. So, fine, I got a bunch and then supplemented that with the Juniper MIBs I could find from LibreNMS's GitHub.
 After doing that the 1.3.6.1.2.1 OIDs resolve, but the enterprise OIDs (1.3.6.1.4.1) still don't -- I see this:
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.8.5.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.12.2.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 The SNMPWALK command I'm using is:
 snmpwalk -M "C:\MIBs" -v2c -c myjunipercommunitystring the.firewall.ip.address "1"
 Any insight on this would be hugely appreciated. I understand this might be an odd question; please don't ask why I'm trying to do this when there are better tools available.
 This is, unfortunately, how I need to do it.

 I see we do not have any expiration time set in sharepoint settings, but users are claiming they have to keep regenerating links because clients are getting "This link has expired" after X amount of days (they don't know the exact timeframe)
 Any ideas on how I can make expiration less links for our userbase without having to set up guest access for these external clients?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody. I took over a very small company where I need to setup all PCs and accounts from scratch, since the existing setup is horrible.
 The situation: I have 5 work stations that are shared by many employees. They do not need own users, just an "employee" user to access office and the NAS, because they are in general not doing typical office work. So no individual mails, onedrive, teams, etc necessary. 
 If you could create this from scratch how would you do it?
 I thought about getting 5 win11 pro licenses and 5 device licences for office 2021 and then create the same local users (Admin and employee) on every device. Could I also create those users in Azure ad and manage them there, so I do not have to create the users on each device individually? How can I setup the printers for everybody without doing this manually on every pc? What is needed and are there any monthly costs to expect?
 Looking forward to hear from your experiences and recommendations!

 After this error log, I fixed the street field and the user synced with Azure AD.

 I tried by clicking “Restart provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I also tried by clicking “Stop provisioning” and then click “start provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I also tried by clicking “Stop provisioning” and then click “Restart provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I tried “provision on demand” by adding the specific user but it keep failing.
 I also tried to remove the group which the user was in from provisioning.

 Anyone got this issue ? If yes, did you manage to provision your user ?

 I'm currently working with MDT to create a new Windows 10 deployment for a client of us. They use multiple Lenovo laptop types, T14, X250, x1, P15, etc and are using an offline media tool (USB). For some reason im unable to deploy the associated drivers per laptop type via de Task sequence. I've given up to try and deploy them during the task sequence via the official way.
 ​
 I've now created a script to manually run after the deployment from the USB where it will install all the drivers. I've created multiple "driver" folders per laptop type, the script is located in each laptop type folder so it will only install the right drivers.
 ​
 Im now looking into a script to check the %make%\%model% and run the associated laptop type script. Say i'm deploying the task sequence on a Lenovo T14, and the script in that specific laptop type folder is called DriversT14.bat. Could anyone help me with the creation of this script?

 I am a sysadmin for a small company, but I am really a software developer. This means sometimes when it comes to networking and errors related to this my knowledge is a little bit off. Please help me with some useful informations, so maybe I can tell the problem to my ISP. 
 We are using our ISP with a modem that is set to IPv4. After that we have our main router (Archer AX73 v1.0, running 1.2.2 Build 20220317 rel.50456(4555)), which I am able to configure as I want. This is a must, because we are using port forwarding for some of our services (might change it later, with different server located elsewhere). Most of the websites are reachable for example youtube.com and stuff. However some websites (ie. netflix.com) are not, which is very strange for me. There is no filtering o…]]></summary>

 So, how do you upgrade MSXML? Do you simply uninstall the old version and install the new one?
 From reading List of Microsoft XML parser (MSXML) versions and Installing and Redistributing MSXML) it seems like the newer version won't be backwards compatible, and software using it won't work.
 Is there any way to determine whether any installed software depends on this component?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a fun situation, we lease a facility with multiple companies and a shared utility area that contains the network ingress. When we moved in we installed a small wall mount enclosure with a lock for our equipment in that room. It is well marked that it is our property.
 About two year ago we found somebody popped the lock and installed their own equipment in our cabinet. We rose hell with the landlord and got it removed.
 Fast forward a couple month the same thing happened and we suspected it was the carrier tech but couldn't prove it. Since we are closest to the room our business lead on-site is often asked to allow service people in the room and we inform him under no condition should any carriers ever be given non-escorted access.
 A few weeks later we get a call that a carrier tech showed up unannounced on a Friday afternoon. He was informed we would be happy to schedule to have him return on Monday to be a good neighbor but if they couldn't escort him we didn't have time. They tech was pissed.
 When he returned the next week he still wasn't happy. Now we are in a small market so there are not a lot of local techs so we will run into him over and over....he doesn't provide service with a smile.
 Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and we have power outage and telecom issues. We arrive at the facility and find someone popped our lock again and unplugged the fiber from just our equipment (none of our neighbors).
 Before this incident the landlord refused to allow us to put our own surveillance on this common space. After explaining to him we would hold his company liable for any business losses due to their negligence to secure our equipment in a shared space we finally have a camera installed. I'm low key hoping the person who has been doing this is the person we think--we will have video evidence this time to take action.
 I hate having shared equipment closets of any type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've got a weird issue with random POE failure on one of my Meraki 120-48FP switches. 
 The switch specs state that it can provide 740 W of usage, and I've got several POE Polycom phones connected to it. Each phone draws about 3W, though each advertises to the switch that it needs up to 7W.
 However, powering more than 5 phones simultaneously results in a complete POE failure. The instant a sixth device is plugged in, all POE goes completely offline. None of the phones advertise that they're pulling more than 3.7W at the time of failure. Looking at the power status page for the Meraki switch shows that it's using 13.9 W of 1612 W (???) available prior to its failure.
 I've contacted Meraki support, and they thought it was "weird" that the switch shows 1612 W available, but they haven't provided any tips or thoughts on why that is. Thinking the switch was defective, I replaced it with another Meraki 120-48FP, but the exact same problem occurs. I've experimented with different ports (including powering up the devices in different order), but the same problem occurs. 
 The TL;DR version: Any five POE phones can be active, but the instant I power up a sixth POE phone, all POE goes offline.
 Has anyone seen this or something similar to it? I'm at my wit's end here and would greatly appreciate any troubleshooting tips.

It is my position that both the structured cabling team and our MSP need to work together. It is a spaghetti factory in the MDF and it is likely going to be frustrating and unnecessarily difficult to replace our infrastructure without organizing, repairing and overhauling the structured cabling in the MDF.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I posted to this sub and to the Cisco community on some extreme system slowdowns I suspected were caused by Cisco Secure Endpoint after deploying version 8.x clients.
 https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/108hl0q/cisco_secure_endpoint_customers_have_you_seen
 https://community.cisco.com/t5/endpoint-security/cse-8-0-1-and-8-1-3-causing-significant-slowdown-after-4-5-days/td-p/4731584
 After months of talking to TAC, they finally reproduced this and confirmed it's a bug. Long story short, it's a GDI object leak with Cisco Secure Client which is included with Secure Endpoint version 8.x.
 Both TAC and a Cisco employee in the above community thread said that the bug is fixed in 8.1.7, which will be released mid-April. I currently have a pre-release, unsupported 8.1.7 client added to my Secure Endpoint console for testing, and I can confirm that it is fixing the problem as intended.
 Wanted to provide an update for anyone that has been experiencing this.

 I haven't touched anything. Swear. Mostly because I vaguely know enough to break shit. 
 Anyway the problem is that over the last couple of days I've noticed internet performance on WiFi devices has gone to absolute crap. I have a 1200 Mbps internet connection and from wired devices I can get a speed test showing almost 1 gig down. Wifi devices connected to my Cisco APs is something like 180 Mbps on 5 Ghz and on 2.4 Ghz the speeds are like 60 Mbps down. I can tell something has gone on with the Cisco stuff because if I take the xfinity gateway out of bridge mode and use that WiFi I get download speeds similar to the wired download speeds. 
 Hoping some folks can give me some things to look at and hopefully get my wireless back to normal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflecting on my career one truth has always emerged: "The harder I worked, the more they took me for granted."
 It seems counter-intuitive, frustrating and demoralizing, so why is it?
 Well, simply put: They get used to it. When you consistently deliver high-quality work or go above and beyond what's expected, it can become the new norm. People may come to expect this level of effort from you without recognizing or acknowledging it.
 Another reason is that people may not realize how much effort you're putting in. If you're not vocal about your accomplishments or don't receive regular feedback or recognition, others may not be aware of the extent of your hard work.
 And lastly, you're running around all stressed out and scaring the commoners. Relax, everyone likes Tony, the IT guy who moves like a sloth, and doesn't react to anything, we love Tony! But then there's Marc, running around, always walking fast in the hallways, slow down Marc! His clothes are a little too tight, go up a size Marc, it's okay, relax.
 So what can you do about it? The answer is obvious, don't give so much, pull back a little. Now mind you, and put down the pitchforks, I'm speaking to my IT heroes out there, the ones who go above and beyond, answer the phone during Thanksgiving dinner, or Saturday morning at 2am.
 IT admins work in the background, they get no recognition or praise, we work in the shadows, in the server rooms and IDFs where no one can see.
 When things are working, great! "So, what exactly do you do here again?" And when things aren't working: "Hey, are you working on this or what is it you do here exactly?"
 So relax, and don't be a hero, they don't give a damn either way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/sysadmin!
 Just an FYI, I am about 6 months in to my first Sysadmin position and I have been enjoying it so far. That said, I am running into issues with a boss ask: Separate Domain Admin level ability (eg: GPO changes, ADUC, etc) from our existing Admin accounts. 
 Quick background of our environment:
  
Large enterprise with thousands of accounts and servers globally.
 Currently, privileges are tiered out like: 
 Admin Level Accounts, Admin rights on "high security" systems (eg:domain controllers, SCCM, core infrastructure, Active Directory / group policy management)
 Server Level Accounts. Admin rights on Utility or Application host boxes. 
 Branch Level Accounts. Unprivileged workstation accounts. 
 Tiered accounts only have logon rights to their respective Tiered Servers.
 
 Domain Level Servers require MFA for Local/RDP access. Our MFA solution uses federation out to Azure to authenticate. 
  
Now the ask: What would the best way to split DA functions to its own dedicated account, but will not have admin rights over anything but AD itself. 
 My idea was to Remove DA from the existing Admin Level accounts and create a dedicated "DA-Only" account that would not have login rights to any server (or only to a utility box), use the existing admin accounts to log into a jumpbox, and utilizing runas to open any tools needed to perform AD administration. That said, I am running into the problem where I cannot restrict the "DA-Only" accounts from local and TS login as that prevents that account from any sort of interactive login. 
 I would love to know if anyone else has done something like this or could point me in the right direction on how to implement. Thank you folks!

I understand that tracert is a layer 3 protocol and to trace a path at layer 2 would require access to each switch's mac address table, but it's 2023 god damnit there should be some standardization to deal with this by now. I know there's a cisco solution that relies on CDP but, again it's 2023 not everyone uses Cisco anymore.
 you'd think somebody would make some combination of regular traceroute that sends arp requests along the way at each hop to triangulate this information

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is in the market for a copper cable qualifier. We need a way to quickly, easily, and reliably test our primarily Cat6 infrastructure for bandwidth, packet loss, and continuity. Additionally, we don't have anyone on staff that is an expert at networking, so having a tester that is easy to learn and use is almost a necessity, as we don't have the time or resources to learn complex networking concepts. For the most part, everything is Cat6, but the cable certifier needs to support potential future infrastructure upgrades such as Cat7/Cat8. Based on the research I've done, there are a few options, but I'm not sure which direction to go. I really like the look of the Fluke DSX2-8000, but I thought Fluke sold off their network testing line to NetAlly, so am I buying into a dead ecosystem? NetAlly doesn't seem to have an exact replacement for the DSX2-8000, but the EtherScope nXG looks promising. There's also the WireXpert 4500-PRO and NetXpert XG2 from Softing, but I'm worried those will be too complicated to learn and use effectively. Any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 Just wondering what kind of questions/exercises should I expect when being interviewed for a network automation role ? Will be there be a whiteboard coding session ?
 I've been interviewed for plenty of network engineer roles so I know what kind of questions will be asked.
 I have a repo with tons of projects I've worked, I'm familiar with the common libraries/tools used in network automation (ansible, nornir, netmiko, scrapli...SOT like netbox/nautobot) I know python and dabbled with frontend stuff like react and js. Also integrated backend technologies with some of my projects including SQL database, created my own APIs using fastapi or flask, made a full CI/CD pipeline using a dev/prod environment with pre/post check validations.
 I'm not a expert on the tools above, looking to cover as much ground as possible then become an expert on whatever tool the org uses once I'm in.
 I'm currently going through a course about python data structures and algorithms, this may be overkill for a role like this but honestly I don't know what to expect. Any tips/help so I can prepare would be appreciated!
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, MS put out a notice that they plan to deprecate boot.wim support in WDS. In a configuration-as-code model (which will soon be mandated if you are working in the US financial sector), many organizations are necessarily moving to Intune or other "DevOps" tools to do post-OS configuration and state management. What these tools lack is bare metal provisioning and native WDS fills this gap perfectly.
 And while I've always been a huge fan of SCCM/MECM, it's doesn't make sense to support that scale of infrastructure just for OSD. Likewise MDT also has a great many extraneous features and is, frankly, not suitable for the enterprise.
 I am aware that you can create a custom PE image that will boot to WDS but recent PE Setup OCs seem to lack some of the command line parameters that were present in earlier versions, and I feat that w/o official boot.wim support, custom PE support cannot be relied upon in a mission critical environment.
 And while third party and even some open source solutions exist (in fact I wrote my own a few years ago), using an MS provisioning tool to deploy MS operating systems is optimal in terms of streamlined support and vendor management.
 I created user feedback item here, Please upvote if you'd like see continued support for WDS.

First thing I say is "What the heck is going on over there?" I didn't even complete the sentence when their server pops back up online and the backup console says their online. With that I let Office Manger know that their phones should come back soon. Phone starts ringing. Other minor issues clear up as we're talking. Magic

 Allowed ports are 8001, 80,443,123,3389 and 53.
 Rest of the ports are blocked with the rule called "Block All Ports" 
 If Block All Ports rule is enabled then the connection to server is dropped after few minutes, if disable this rule then all is good for hours and days. 
 Inspected the packets with wireshark, the server is sending FIN request and the client is RST "resetting the connection"
 im wondering if i have to allow any specific port to keep the connection alive ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok. So, I currently have 144 small mini computers (actually, 2021 Apple TV 4Ks) with a bespoke app in single-app mode that are used on film sets for displaying graphics on computer screens, with remote loading of content and a control protocol for color correction, etc.
 Works great.
 The issue I have is with the # that can be simultaneously powered on at a time and associate with an AP. I have found that Qualcomm's Networking Pro 1200 platform within a (wait for it..) Ubiquiti Amplifi Alien on channel 165 works great for my use-case. Channel 165 is the only channel I have available for use on a film set. All others are unavailable, especially DFS channels. These are never available, because of Teradek Bolt camera wireless video systems.
 On the Alien, I can easily power on 100 or so Apple TVs and they associate fine. But, beyond this number, I need to space them out by several minutes. If I wait a few minutes, I can easily get 144 client associations and everything works fine and dandy. But, the inability to power them all on simultaneously could be a problem. On some sets, this would be impractical, because the power for the entire set is turned off at wrap, and turned on at call time the next day. So, ideally, I'd be able to have 150-200 associations happen seamlessly and without delay.
 So, question is: what other vendors are using this Qualcomm Networking Pro 1200 chipset with 8x8:8 MU-MIMO on 802.11ax in an AP that perhaps has a quicker client association time?
 Had my eyes on a Ruckus R850, perhaps with a Netgear M4250 AV Line switch (model # GSM4210PD-100NAS) which has a built-in DHCP server, as we've had very good results with this series of switches generally.
 Thoughts? Got any better ideas? Thanks!

 For me, it's vital, that I can keep up with every little task that might come my way and since the few internal admins before me never bothered all too much with their work here, I don't have any tools, to manage my work with. Luckily, my employer is quite generous and told me, to make a list with necessary tools and equipment, which they are willing to purchase for me.
 I haven't gotten access to the entire infrastructure yet. In fact, I'm still pretty much just a user, with no admin access, whatsoever, but I suspect, that will be given to me in time.
 But until then, I need said tools, to manage my tasks and work and not lose sight of anything. I don't know, if I need a fully blown ticketing system yet, since there won't be too many inquires in the beginning, but something, to create projects with and manage all steps of the way, keeping track of steps in between and also logging all activities, I've written down, without having to manually save them, would be fantastic.
 Keep in mind, my former employer already had all the tools, but they were enterprise solutions for keeping tracks of dozens of customers. 
 If you have any recommendations and have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate any and all tips for my future work here.
 Thanks a lot and have a nice week!

 the choices are between: Cisco Classic (9000 series) and Cisco Meraki.

 I'm curious about it because users currently connect with GlobalProtect. Nearly all traffic is tunneled for URL filtering and inspection purposes. Two issues with that are how to dynamically handle the exceptions for what is not tunneled and public WIFI connections that redirect to a captive portal to accept terms before allowing a user out to the internet. For whatever reason, EDL's can't be used to define tunneling exceptions.
 My consideration of the Windows client is mostly driven by the ability to manage it with group policy and possibility to be a more seamless experience for users.

 I'm currently considering re-evaluating the endpoint security stack, and I wanted to get some thoughts and opinions on the best options for remote only devices. It's been a while since I've tested most of the products and I know some of the products would have likely changed a fair amount. As I suspect most products would have adjusted by now to device only and zero trust.
 The environment does have a large amount of application change and custom plugin development thus solutions like Windows Applocker and ThreatLocker would have way too much administrative overhead. Locking down the binaries could work if it was an automated system existed based on a Security Sandbox (Crowdstrike, VMRay, etc) but this would still be limited capability (file-less, etc).

 I'm moving the company to a new plant and I have the opportunity to reorganize the network. I have about 100 users, in the network I have file server, applications and remote workers . I have a couple of L3 switch DELL 5048F connected with VLT as core switch. The perimeter firewall is hardware and it is connected to the core switch with 2x1GB cable. To the core switches are also connected the ESX host that contains all the production VM. In order to increase the network security I want restrict the traffic to some VLANs where the virtual machinaes are connected. The question is: is it better filter the traffic with the perimetere firewall, with the ACL on the switch or the better solution is to introduce an additional internal firewall as virtual machine?
 This is a schematic L2 connection

 In my opinion the virtual firewall appliance should be the better solution (statefull inspection, maneageability, ecc.). I will be "tromboning" but I think it will be acceptable.

 ​
 I'm running a backup server with a Quantum Superloader 3 directly connected by SAS. The server has both Backup exec and Veeam backup and replication. Veeam has taken over as our main backup for onsite and scaling out,however i'd like to use it for tape backups as an additional air-gapped last resort backup.
 ​
 Backup exec works fine with the tape loader however Veeam doesn't seem to acknowledge the tapes. I've reinstalled the drivers from Quantum and added the server in Veeam as a tape library. Any advise on what to try next? Does having backup exec on the server cause issues with other applications accessing the tape drive even once closed and services have been stopped? The fact it works fine on in Backup Exec suggests drivers and hardware are all fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I'm posting here in hope some people better educated and more knowledgeable than I am might be able to help with a bit of a technical headache I have!
 I play Rocket League professionally and I'm based in the UK. Rocket League is extremely sensitive to jitter for whatever reason and I'm having a real issue with it at the moment. Unfortunately, playing at a high level requires very low jitter.
 I currently use Zen Internet (FTTP) and have a high-end router and have noticed my routing to the Rocket League servers is pretty bad. Here's a link to a WinMTR showing the issue: Routing
 The first few hops always have pretty bad jitter along them and it's incredibly annoying, resulting in a lot of in-game issues. It gets worse at peak times. 
 I have contacted Zen about this issue but they won't — or can't — do anything. I use WTFast to circumvent further bad exchanges and that helps a lot, but there's still significant jitter and I feel this is because the first few hops are still used when routing. If I'm wrong about that, please let me know.
 Ultimately, I'm looking to change ISPs because of this. It's losing me money and time and is negatively affecting my mental health. To my understanding, I can't really know whether the routing of an ISP will be good or not without purchasing it first. What are my options here?
 I'd be very grateful if anyone from the UK can run a WinMTR to the same server and list their ISP alongside. To be clear, this issue is the same with pretty much all Rocket League servers.
 Thank you for your time and effort. I'll do my best to respond to comments!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I generally try to stay clear of replacing laptop batteries but I work for a none-profit and we try rinse all the life out of end user hardware that we can. Lately we've had a few HP & Dell laptops (Intune managed, AAD joined) come in with dead batteries not holding charge - after a replacement, they start getting issues relating to the CMOS checksum & TPM, which usually throws the laptops into Bitlocker recovery mode. Initially I thought the CMOS battery was also EOL but replacing that doesn't seem to help, neither does clearing the TPM either through BIOS or through Windows security settings. 
 It's gotten to the point where we've recalled the laptops that have had battery replacements and issued new ones due to the amount of tickets getting raised, but the laptops are still serviceable so I would like to come up with a solution to get them back into circulation. I used to work for an MSP and their hardware department would flat out refuse to fix or change any hardware on an Intuned laptop, including the battery. 
 Any advice please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am configuring a bunch of cisco switches, and I have tried to automate my process.I have a simple python script that is sending all the config via xmodem to the device, then i set the management ip and save the config.This works fine, but, some of the switches, even after setting the managament ip in the managament, are automaticlaly changing that vlan to DHCP.
 Example:
 * (Boot a blank switch, say no to auto-configuration). > enable # copy xmodem: running-config # conf t # interface vlan 10 # ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0 # end # write mem 
 At this point, everything works fine. But, in some cases, when i connect a trunk cable from my network to that switch and do "show run int vlan 10" i see that it has changed to "ip address dhcp". This doesn't happen all the time, only some times.
 I have a small suspicion that it might be caused by PnP, but i have no idea how to avoid it or turn it off.
 Even after reloading the switch, some of them still keep the dhcp thing.Please help. its driving me nuts!
 Ps: (The reason i started sending config via xmodem is because when i was copy-pasting the configs, i had to do it un chunks, as it would ofter overflow the serial buffer. And sending line-by-line via the script takes forever.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit!
 I'm gonna get straight to the point on this one.
 I work for a large company with 2k+ employees, obviously we have quite a huge load on our HR and Salary department with all these employees. Currently whenever someone needs to hire someone, onboard someone, change an employeement agreement etc they do it via Microsoft forms that are connected to PowerAutomate to send the information to the correct place / inbox, this has been quite chaotic and we are looking into getting a proper "HR Service management" or ticketing system for HR and Salary instead.
 We have looked into the Freshservice HR workspace but since Freshservice is built for IT first it makes me quite sceptical, we also need to be able to easily create HR processes for recruitment orders, workpermits and employee changes and this has proven quite troublesome in the Freshservice demo I've worked with setting up. A lot of bugs and the documentation for Fresh leaves a lot to be desired.
 Therefore we are looking at other solutions but it's difficult to find out there, any tips or pointers?
 Our biggest needs are:
  
Users being able to submit tickets to HR, and HR being able to easily view and process said tickets.
 Users being able to order new recruitments, HR then needs to be able to view current ongoing recruitment processes in some sort of list or "view" listing all ongoing recruitments.
 Users being able to send in work permits with HR being able to track current workpermits, aswell as being alerted when a work permit is about to expire.
 Integration into Salesforce and Azure is a must.
 All of the above needs to be exported once a month as a .csv to our HR master so it can stay up to date with the changes.
 Bonus if it has support for integration / APIs with Teamtailor.
  
Thank you very much in advance Reddit, any tips are helpful and very much appreciated. Sorry for potentially poor grammar or spelling, English is not my first language.

 I've been contemplating setting an auto reply to tickets featuring keywords and waiting 30 minutes. But I suspect that won't go over well.

 - I can go for a degree apprenticeship, level 5/6 in networking
 - I can not do any more apprenticeships and focus on individual qualifications i.e. CompTIA net, sec, etc...
 - I can try go for level 4 in security, but this is a half option as I'm not sure I would be able to complete this with my company

 What is important to us is:
  
It should always work, even if internet fails.
 It should be secure, i.e. people should not be able to access the system.
 Preferably it checks for updates online (e.g. webpage, docker container pull, snap update) 
 Alternatively, if we can remote desktop into it, we could manually update it
 
 Remote management/maintenance (SSH or remote desktop).
  
Good to know
  
We have made the app ourselves, so if needed, we can wrap it in electron.
 The app uses angular routing, so simple file:// hosting could be problematic.
 For hardware, we have an Intel NUC and a touchscreen display.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 ​
 I want to use Huntress in a network that should not have direct connect to non-private IPs.
 According to Huntress, there is currently no support for "explicit-proxy-configurations". Currently, I am trying to find any other option.
 ​
 My first attempt was to assign one internal IP to every external DNS-connection, Huntress needs and to use HAProxy there as "non-decrypting" proxy:
 ​
 listen huntress-tcp bind 10.xx.xx.xx:443 mode tcp server-template huntress-aws- 1 huntress.io:443 check resolvers docker init-addr libc,none 
 --> And then to change in \etc\hosts:
 10.xx.xx.xx huntress.io 
 ...but I am still getting timeouts, when I try to connecto to https://huntress.io
 ​
 Do you have any idea on how to solve this without opening the network to the "full range of AWS-IPs", If I cannot work with DNS wildcards?
 ​

 I am in desperate look out for a cost-effective eBGP agg router that can cope with up to 4 uplinks with full bgp table.
 The thing is my traffic is very little, it will not even exceed 100mbps!
 All the routers that can cope with this routing table size are quite oversized for my network throughput.
 The most cost-effective option is Mikrotik, but from a pure image perspective, it may not work for us.
 From what I can see, the cheapest option would be Cisco ASR 1001-X with 16GB of RAM. Any other idea?

 This may be an issue for r/helpdesk or some such, but I think it qualifies for this sub as well. I have a user that has some issues with Excel files. Specifically, the files when opened via SMB using file explorer are opening verly slowly. So a 30 MB excel file will only download at like 10 Mb, so it takes forever. 
 The files when opened using the Recent Files tab in Excel work just fine. As expected. Also they work without issue over OneDrive or when saved locally. 
 Googling this issue reveals it is an issue with Excel file validation. So I turned it off. Still having the issue. Just curious if anyone here has any suggestions or ideas, or perhaps has encountered this issue themselves.

 What's the "Correct" or prefered way of managing all the customers diffrent 365 accounts?
 I've got some where I have an unlicenced admin account on their domain that I use but that gets messy logging in and out of everything constantly.
 I'm in the middle of setting a new one up and thought why not just add a new domain to my account and manage it all in one place. Seemed to work alright initially but there's no way of seperating the two organizations and one drive had my org details on it.
 After searching online I found out about tenants being part of multiple orgs but nothing about how to set that up from scratch. 
 Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems to be the right place to ask, though I guess the question is a bit low-level...
 I've got a new FreePBX system replacing an old one, very similar, just a much newer version; the OS is based on Centos. Networking and Linux aren't my forte! The system has one card connected to our LAN and another connected to a dedicated Cisco DSL router which comes from our SIP trunks provider.
 I have got it setup so that it mostly works, but initial connections to the web server and to a soft phone are very slow. For instance 50 seconds to initiate a call. After that it's often quicker, which then makes diagnoses more difficult.
 I previously setup the old one up and think I had similar issues, but that was not too far off a decade ago!
 I have tried to copy the default gateway (and other routes) in each case
 Old one
 ​ default 11.11.11.11 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth1 
 (I have replaced the correct IP address with 11.11.11.11)
 New one
 default gateway 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth1 
 (The new one just has the word gateway, I entered it with the ip address.)
 Any suggestions of what I should be doing to work it out, or obvious reasons for this behaviour?

 It’s a complicated environment so I’m thinking a list of infrastructure projects to help me get to know the team and have something to show my new boss. 
  
checking/learning/trial run of their disaster recovery and backups -tabletop exercises- what happens if server a goes down, switch b does, etc -meeting with each of my team separately to see what they have for projects, pain points, wishes -Review existing IT documentation -not sure if the political atmosphere leans this way yet, but if I have my way spending time in each IT role doing the job to get a feel for what they are doing/encountering
  
Find out how they are managing IT budget and schedule what is next to order or plan for on the annual schedule
 How are they doing contract management and are there any contracts coming due this year that I need to plan or budget for
 I have one project that is almost to completion that has stalled. I’m well versed and could whip it out pretty quick- How long do I wait before prodding it to completion? I could literally do this day 1 but it wouldn’t be appropriate. No one likes that guy. 
 Non-IT side- 
 Meet with all of the different departments to introduce myself, ask if they have any pain points, any currents projects, any future projects, any wishes, or anything else that I can do to help or make their lives easier
 So…what’s your first 90 days look like?

 Possible role: System Administrator - $65k *commute 50 minutes *M-F schedule from 7-3 *comes with Top Secret Security Clearance *more of what I want to do career wise 
 So I currently work as a contractor for a F500 company as a NOC Tech. The company makes all new hires contract to perm and the track record is, if you make it 6 months, you are converted to salary (I have been here for ~2 months). I currently make $80k as a contractor but have little to no benefits to speak of. When converted, the salary is $70k. As a caveat, I am not really enjoying the work and can see why the turnover rate is sky high. 
 I have been contacted by a company that I applied for shortly before starting this position for an interview as a system administrator. The company is in the aerospace and defense industry and the programs it supports are very intriguing to me. The role also comes with a top secret security clearance. I would also be getting hired on as a salaried employee with full benefits and a starting salary of $65k. 
 My career goal was to become a system administrator and an engineer following that. So I could also see myself moving up or out of the Sys. Admin role within the next 2 years as well (if all goes well of course). I guess my concern would be switching jobs so soon after starting the one I am at and the commute is double the time. Idk. 
 What would you chose? Any input is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a question regarding Cisco Business 150AX. I want to set up 802.1x authentication (using a RADIUS/NPS server) with dynamic VLAN assignment.
 I noticed that there is a limitation of 16 VLANs, but I couldn't find anywhere if this limitation is static or dynamic. In other words, is it possible to have more than 16 VLANs via 802.1x?
 Since I'm going to have to trunk between my switch and the terminal, does the limit apply at the trunk level or at the AP level itself? Or does it have to do with the number of simultaneously active VLANs?
 Thank you very much for your help. I have spent a lot of time looking for this information on the internet and in the documentation, but I have not found anything about this.
 Sincerely,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/networking friends and family! 
 Looking for some routing best practices help!
 I've got (2) Cisco Nexus 3132Q switches [running NXOS 7.0(3)I7(9)] that are configured for vPC and HSRP that host 10ish SVI's each.
 I only have a single ASA 5525 [running 9.1(2)] that has a single OUTSIDE interface going to our single carrier.
 These are the cards that I've been dealt, for now.
 I'm looking for the most resilient INSIDE Layer3 design with what I have. I have up to 2 physical interfaces on each Nexus 3k's that I can use for these Layer3 links. The ASA has plenty of physical interfaces to work with.
 I'm looking for the most resilient configuration possible, with the hardware that I have, to advertise the default route from the ASA and the SVI's from the core switches. I would prefer to stay away from static routes (other than the default route on the OUTSIDE interface) if I can. EIGRP or OSPF would be preferred.
 There seems to be heavy debate about using vPC's for layer 3 links. Some say its possible, depending on hardware/code version, some say that even if it IS possible, its poor design. Some people seem to recommend ECMP from the firewall.
 To the community: Would you please loan me your experience and provide some advice for my scenario, with some configuration examples?
 Thank you all SO very much for your contributions. 
 Mike

 Would it be possible to isolate a web server with pfsense in between that prevents it to access the lan? Like https://i.imgur.com/asmlj7Q.png. It would be like a cheap-o DMZ, sort of. The aim is to prevent the LAN to be attacked if the web server is compromised.
 I'm working in a small company where everyone is connected to the same wireless router and I don't want to change anything (put anything in between the router and the LAN clients). The web server is for test purposes so it won't be used for anything serious. But I still want to make sure that if it gets hacked it can't reach the LAN.
 Would this work? Is it safe? Thanks!

 Are there any other windows default settings that can be changed to improve performance?
 We have storage with SSDs in place and sufficient vCPUs and RAM for the RDS hosts (Server 2019), but the hosts seem relatively slow when opening Office applications. The machines are booting extremely fast since they are on the ssds, but the RDS environment seems a little bit slow.
 The performance with only one logged in user is the same as with 10 logged in users.
 ​
 Specs: 
 5-10 users per Host
 10 vCPUs
 64GB RAM
 FSLogix Profiles

Their request was that they do not want anything that needs expensive memberships. The cost of the equipment wasn't a problem. A logical amoubt for a membership will not be a problem. So i created the network with 4 ubiquiti switches, a MikroTik 48 port PoE switch and a CCR-1016-12G and 2 WANs for redunduncy. I would like to keep all of the existing setup. Please note that the firewall on the MikroTik is well configured, and there is port security on each switch. 
 My question is: would you adding any kind of firewall before the MikroTik router - something like a NGFW or some kindof IPS/IDS? I feel that the mikrotik firewall rules just don't cut it for today's standards and network moniroting and/or blocking is necessary. What kind of firewall could i add before the existing router that could filter trafic before it reaches the internal network?
 Basically it seems like i might need a transparent firewall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have to migrate two custom made asp.net and asp.net mvc apps with sql server. Database is over 25GB. So I am going a VPS route because I am a sysadmin/DevOps and can install/maintain myself and I don't want to fight limitations and obstacles of normal web hosting, managed databases, it even hard to find this combo. Also I don't know what those apps expect from system so VPS is a safe route because you can customize everything.
 So recommend good VPS hosting which also offers sql server (as a separate service or install into VPS from their media/license).
 I can install SQL server myself, that would be even prefered, but I don't want to bother my clients with separate swl server licensing for VM in VPS hosting so I would like that to be solved by VPS provider.

Then two weeks later another user has the same issue as well as me. I found KB5023696 was installed the same day, uninstalled it and RDP began working again. I removed the KB from all of the users whom had RDP issues and this resolved the issue. The two week hold was our RMM software holding back updates as we have it setup. I am not sure why that KB is breaking RDP for users but I hope this helps another sysadmin from trying to determine why RDP broke. The weirdest part is it is hit or miss as some users with the update do not have issues while others can't work at all.

Yet, I think for many of us, we are in this space of being willing to learn, but its hard to understand just what direction. Then when we do choose one, its got 50 branches. 
 ​
 Future seems to be cloud, and IMO not IaaS but PaaS and SaaS.
 Been cruising along and learning Power Platform. This is on top of O365 Teams, SharePoint and all the admin portals to do normal traditional Sysadmin stuff, along with PowerShell scripting and command to admin those portals via CLI.
 Then just the other day I am trying to automate something, and it seems to do it I need to use Microsoft graph. I never even heard of this before two days ago. I was able to setup things in O365 to connect in and "get" the data I wanted. Then I realized that I have no idea how to output it in some readable format for an end user. Looks like Python dictionaries. Pretty sure its web code, I am not a web dev. I know I can figure it out but:
 Where do I draw the line? Where do I focus? I have fun going down each rabbit hole I open, but where do I ensure that I am ultimately valuable as an employee, which in turn means I cand ensure I am compensated? Money isn't everything, but at the end of the day I want to make it, and I am a company man, a 9-5er, a person that likes to clock in and clock out. Whatever you call it.

 I forgot to give them a port on our switch. When the install date came, they called me all day asking for assistance. However, I was busy and couldn't return their call. By the time I got back to them, they had already taken the network down, and caused a real mess breaking our connection to the main office, and kicking some remote workers offline. I asked them why they couldn't wait to install it, and they said they had scheduled this two weeks ago. We lost some business over it. About 2 hours where the network was completely down. The camera technician managed to bring it back up somehow. I thought it was their fault, and wrote my boss a Cover Your Ass (CYA) ("mine"). He immediately shot back with "Why didn't you give them a port?!" I'm feeling really stupid over this, and feel like I might be losing my job when I go in Monday. Has anyone ever done this before, and forgotten to tell a vendor which port to use? 
 TLDR: I forgot to give our camera company a port to use their static IP on. Now I'm in some hot water.

 We are considering moving to MS 365 from Google Workspace for a multitude of reasons. Most steps are straightforward, as far as Google Drive, Gmail to Exchange Online (and I've done exchange migrations in the past), etc
 As we are running through our prep checklist with sales department, we realized there is going to be a major snag, that we haven't considered.
 Our Sales team is using their "Google Account" instead of email/password to authenticate against a multitude of services, for example - HubSpot, various marketing sites, and a multitude of other tools that they use.
 Their Google accounts are ["joan.smith@COMPANY.com](mailto:"joan.smith@COMPANY.com)" not "@gmail.com), since "company.com", is now going to be hosted by MS, their "social logins" are now going to be Microsoft's ones, not Google's.
 While I can assist them with migrating a couple of these services to email/password authentication, instead of "Social Login", I'm sure we are not the first people to run into this problem.
 So is there a suggested way to do it? Or are we in the dreaded territory of "VENDOR LOCK IN" ?
 🙀
 P.S.:
 35 people start up. But not a tech one. So we have 1 IT - person - me. Migrating 700 = 35 people x 20-30? Social login accounts on various websites - is not something I want to tackle.

 I'm currently stuck with a network problem. Maybe one of you can help me.
 For a shake test of an RJ45 to fiber optic converter, it must be checked for correct functionality during the simulated earthquake.
 What do I have in mind: My idea would be the following structure... Laptop -> (RJ45 cable) -> Converter -> (FO loop TX to RX)
 https://ibb.co/vLvQz5R
 Now I think I know that the UDP protocol is one-way and I can use a python script with the socket library to send a UDP packet over the laptop's ethernet interface to itself over the loop with the converter. If the packet arrives at the open socket, the connection is OK.
 Unfortunately this doesn't work. I receive the sent packet at any time. The packet is probably still delivered internally in the computer and does not leave it via the Ethernet interface. I tried to set up a route locally for the IP used (Route add 192.168.1.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 IF 9). Unfortunately, this also does not bring the desired result.
 I would be very grateful for any food for thought.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have 50+ HP desktops of the same model new in the box that need to be deployed in the coming weeks. Long story short - we recently had a cyber attack that resulted in us rebuilding our network/servers and we lost a couple of staff along the way who were the ones who usually handled our imaging process. On top of that our software packages have broken links and don't run correctly with the network rebuild, so we're not in good shape.
 The good thing is, most of our staff use the exact same base build on their devices, so if there is a way to clone one good image to multiple devices that are the same model, that would be ideal for this project. We have the software install packages, but manually pushing them can take 2-3 hours per computer and requires a few reboots. We have been lucky thus far to not need to replace a lot of PC's since the outage, and I was able to build several of them as spares to swap out if needed using the manual process.
 I know there are multiple tools out there that do many things, so I am mostly wondering what some recommendations are for something that will get the job done. We do have a couple KVM's so can image multiple at a time - but how do we package a clone of an image to push out, and what does that process look like - especially with joining devices to the domain.
 In my old job at an MSP, we just manually installed everything per device as we had a lot of small companies that requested maybe 2-3 computers at a time on average, so it was not a big deal. Prior to that I worked for a large hospital that had SCCM set up to deploy Windows on PXE boot, which was very nice, but I have no idea how that process was set up. Though I'd like to eventually find the time to create something like that for our environment.

 If LUKS is only viable option, do you unlock disks remotely? Do you rotate passphrases somehow (ansible, homegrown scripts)?

They currently use a Kyocera EcoSys M3655idn. They are happy with it so far, but they are currently leasing it and would rather own one and have it serviced in-house by their own IT team which they are in the process of forming.
 Their requirements are fairly basic in terms of features: b/w printing, duplex, copy, scan, fax
 I primarily recommend Brother printers to all my small-biz and home office clients, but this is a larger staff and higher print volume than any that I have dealt with in the past.
 Will appreciate the recs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I left my last job because it got boring (normal sys-/network admin job), now I'm working as a DevOps & cloud engineer (and as a sysadmin in the shadows)... and to be honest, I think I'm ready to move up a notch again, but I don't really want to leave the company. Tbh they are too small with 30 devs (yet >50% growth per year).
 It's cool that I can help migrate & automate the whole infrastructure and implement new technologies by grinding myself into oblivion, but it seems like I don't have the time to improve the stuff that really needs it - and only build MVPs infrastructure wise, because anything better 'costs too much money - who will pay for this?'. I have no time to tinker like I had some years ago... and our sysadmins are ready waiting for months for some scripts that will make their life 100x easier - but I have no time and now I'm only suffering the perpetual grind of building new novel environments for customers - and can't even do them right because of #AGILE - the sprint is over, bye bye to the budget. Still, colleague wise and in terms of teamwork and communication you can't compare them to any other companies... Quality of life has improved substancially. Less stress - not having to support braindead people is wonderful - but I'm bored.
 I'm feeling like if I don't work on the real, large stuff... on the edge of new tech... I will just lose more time and this will become my new normal. I need to learn new tools, better ways of thinking and want to work on larger projects.
 Anyone here who was in a similar situation? What did you do?
 And nah, I won't post this on /r/devops first, thanks to you guys I even got this far. You'll surely push me further into the abyss.

 We are currently swapping out a bunch of Nexus 3548-X switches and replacing them with 9300 series with VXLAN/EVPN.
 We have an OOB network in place but it's aging and i would like to use 3548 for that. Each of the new OOB switches would perform these functions:
  
connect all management ports for the fabric & console servers
 each leaf would have a dedicated 10G interface to OOB switch for SPAN monitoring
 we wouls transport these SPAN sessions via OOB network to packet brokers and VM for troubleshooting.
 each leaf would have a dedicated 1/10G interface for dataplane monitoring towards OOB switch.
 Each OOB switch would run perfSonar suite in guestshell and perform e2e performance tests - iperf etc.. towards other OOB agents via dedicated VXLAN.
 The collected data would be exported via telemetry
  
Anyone else here doing something similar ? Any advice how to extend OOB for more use-cases ?
 Thanks.

I was hired into this company last year specifically because they had no one filling the role of Cybersecurity. For a year, most of my security recommendations or critical flags have been met with “that is too much work and we can’t afford to possibly break systems to implement that”. I love the job otherwise and have so much freedom and truly little stress of other tasks or expectations. How do I get over my ego and stay with a company longer?
 EDIT: I didn’t want to spark a debate about the cybersecurity vs sysadmin war. I value people’s time and a business’s right to say no. A few have answered my question perfectly, but the goal here was coaching on being satisfied with a job that has value, but I have a problem when I see need/urgency but leadership sometimes ignores core security for paths of least resistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I have multiple computers I can create clusters (maybe with a technology like k8s), and with a bit of work, I can be sure to have near 100% service uptime. Meaning no matter what, even if something happens, another computer is going to handle the requests and everything will be 100% transparent to the end user. That's because the service was designed to handle such cases, maybe by running inside docker, allowing state recovery, and whatnot.
 But here I am wondering about cloud services (AWS and Azure for example). If my knowledge is up to date, these guys have big machines (like terabytes of RAM and tens of cores on a single motherboard), and they use a hypervisor to split these into smaller VM, that they can then rent.
 But in such a case, they cannot run a single VM on different computers right ? So what do they do if one of their computer suddenly has a break down ? If their architecture is designed like I described in the previous paragraph, then all the VM on that machine suddenly shutdown, and their services are no longer available ? So there is now way that they can promise near 100% machine uptime ?
 And even if you keep your machine 100% healthy, with zero internet downtime, you have your own generator in case of electric failure, how to you update your hypervisor ? Wouldn't they need a reboot from time to time ? And if you need to change components, how do you move a running VM from one machine to another ?
 I am not a sys admin btw, I do datascience and AI, so way more math and way less programming, but I am deeply interested in how they solved the problem, so don't hesitate to start from the basics, and many thanks for your time.

 But someone sets up a rogue AP with the same SSID: mycoy and also commercially signs their radius cert: company.xy. My wifi clients get fooled and take the bait? 
 I'm currently using a private CA for my radius. And distribute the CA to the wifi clients.

 I use to work for both Cox and Comcast. Once a router reached EoL status we recommended the customer swap routers.
 Sometimes it felt wrong, especially if the system knew the customer had old equipment, it would just immediately dismiss any other possible issues and refer customer to OEM/Purchase New Router. 
 Other times I would spend 30mins+ checking lines and factory resetting, hardlining into the router and then into the modem and ping testing and guiding the customer through it all just for it to end up being an issue with the EoL Airport. 
 Is it an issue with the outdated firmware handling a more modern modem? or is it just the age of the router and something internally failing? It always felt wrong of me to tell someone to replace the router for it being EoL because otherwise it was capable of handling the customers speeds.

 So we are running Azure AD Connect and just hybrid syncing Edge. The auto login works fine.
 We have no licenses besides the free Azure AD Connect. The Edge Sync has always worked fine, bookmarks, etc.
 Suddenly I have all of my existing users still syncing, even if logging into a workstation they have never used before. But somewhere along the line new user accounts after "X" date are not syncing. It shows the following in edge://sync-internals/ 
 DISABLED_BY_ADMIN, STOP_SYNC_FOR_DISABLED_ACCOUNT, Microsoft Information Protection service is disabled" 
 So after a bunch of trial and error, the only option I had was to do the P2 License Trial just to see what happened and enable ESR. And of course that works, the new users are now able to sync.
 So my questions are, 
 1: Has anyone seen or run into this before? I am seeing conflicting info about how we should not have been able to sync at all without a P1/P2 license to begin with, and other places say no that basic sync was enabled a year or two ago.
 2: Since I have the trial P2 license, I have not assigned any licenses to any users, just enabled ESR. Can I get away with just a single license after the trial to keep ESR enabled?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a customer that I consulted for 5 years as their Network/Admin. The ownership was a 50/50 deal which one half changed hands to new ownership. Out of the blue I get a txt from their new IT person requesting credentials for all systems etc I proceeded to contact new owner that approved this request as I was told absolutely nothing. Well we or I should say me working on behalf of my company sold backup solution which was contracted for 3 years. New IT people says out backups are interfering with theirs and want us to remove the backup. We now have given the customer the invoice to buy out of the contract which is 11 grand and they are crying about it. I want to say be cool with your IT person as maybe this could have gone down for this customer in a better way if they had just reached out and talked with me explaining how they were bringing in their own people. The original owner never said a word or anything yet I was there for them every step of the way even during snow storms to drive there before business opened to push power buttons on surge protectors to turn equipment back on because no one could remember how to push this button even after explaining a few times. Anyways they signed contract and we are going to hold them to it and let it go to collections if needed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[we are using the intune app by techaffinityinc to sync intune with freshservice
 but: as most of our devices are lenovo devices and intune gets the full MTM instead of a friendly name, we have too much products created automaticaly in freshservice.
 has anybody an idea, how to get this fixed and use user-friendly family names instead of the complete MTM?
 example:
 Model (machine type) = 20FMS08H00
 The first 4 digits (20FM) denote the readable model: ThinkPad T460
 This includes MTM with (20FM,20FN)
 The MTM <-> Family can be seen in the table https://download.lenovo.com/bsco/schemas/list.conf.txt
 has anybody already dealed with this?
 maybe a a solution is written here: https://www.systanddeploy.com/2023/01/get-list-uptodate-of-all-lenovo-models.html
 Which refers to these scripts: https://github.com/damienvanrobaeys/Lenovo_Models_Reference
 but i have no idea how to implement it in freshservice
 ​
 other idea was, to write back the family name in intune and map this to product in the app. but i´m not a friend of using wrong fields for other purposes. custom attributes is only available for mac devices. not for win. so any other idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm 90% sure the culprit is a particular LOB app. The LOB app support claims that it is impossible (after multiple escalations) 
 What it boils down to is that SOMETHING is creating a mapped drive as the "system user". This results in the drive showing up as "disconnected" but yet still working when you click on it. However this makes certain functionalities of the program trying to access that drive flakey. This system user mapping takes place "before" the normal user drive mapping gpo takes place. 
 The only way to resolve it is to use psexec and run:
  
psexec -s -i cmd.exe
 net use :x /delete
  
If you do this, then log off the profile and back on, the gpo takes over and properly maps the drive as the user and everything is fine until the next reboot.
  
Things tried/checked:
  
Log on/off Scripts (none)
 Scheduled Task
 GPO (Disabled all of them)
 Startup Items (using lastruns)
 Registry (even manually deleted any possible reference) 
 Uninstalled LOB app then manually deleted any folders or files related to it, including appdata, etc
  
Where else could this possibly "live"? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I'm a 26-year-old with a background in networking and computer hardware, as well as experience in sales, inventory management, and SAP. 
 I'm not from the US.
 I worked for about 3 years in a computer store that sold anything under the sun, think amazon but with local stores and fixing computers in the back office. After 2 years I became the manager of that store and had 3 workers under me.
 After leaving my job as a computer store manager, I traveled Europe with my girlfriend in a motorhome. Now that I have some free time, I'm planning to study for the CCNA certification and pursue a career as a sys admin.
 I studied networking in high school through a Cisco program, and while I had the knowledge for CCNA, I never got the certificate. After highschool I was in the army ( I was a tank driver) so I forgot most of my ccna knowledge a I had.
 I also have experience with light server administration through my home server running OMV and several Raspberry Pis.
 I'm interested in hearing your advice on what areas I should focus on as I work toward becoming a sys admin. I believe I'll have to start in a help desk role and work my way up, but I'm not sure what specific skills and knowledge I should prioritize. Are there other certifications or training programs that you would recommend? How much will a degree help and if it will, in what subject? 
 Before the computer store I did 3 months in tech support in an isp, but hated every second.
 I'm eager to learn and grow in this field, and I would appreciate any advice you can offer based on your experiences. Thank you in advance for your help!

Any ideas or guidelines as to what I should look into?

The client had already removed the bottom so I first checked some of the hardware and made sure it wasn’t stuffed full of dust or anything. Then I put it back on to start troubleshooting other ways
  
I tried restarting
 using the fn keys to see if the screen was simply dimmed down all the way
 I tried plugging into external monitors to see if maybe it was the laptop screen but they wouldn’t display anything either.
 I then booted into the bios and it worked. 
  
I was going to see if maybe there was a firmware update or something that caused this and thought maybe I should roll it back but I thought maybe it would be best to just see if I can get into windows first. I was able to without any issues. 
 My question is.. why did booting into the bios fix the issue? Any ideas? 
 Also, does anyone else get mixed feelings when this kind of thing happens. I feel happy that I was able to help them but I also feel imposter syndrome because I don’t totally know how I fixed the issue… sorry for writing so much. Hope you are having a nice day.

I was not to worried about it before because basically they are known to be scammy but recently we have had customers getting bouncebacks from Microsoft and Gmail services as well.

 Are you paying attention, recruiters? THAT is how you attract the attention of quality people who are going to be what you want. Stop beating around the bush; put the important information front and center, with a reasonable salary, and you'll have the position filled in no time.

 "Engineer Shopping", according to him, is when someone gets told "no" about accessing something, then goes around that person and/or over their head until they find the weak spot that says "yes". The weak spot could potentially be exploited if the user was a bad actor, and that's the type of thing they look for.
 I believe the guy, but I want to learn more about it - because I'm encountering a user just like that. It sure seems like it should be a CyberSecurity issue, but what do I look up?
 p.s. I thought this was too simplistic for the CyberSecurity sub - after reading some of their discussions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having issues deciphering the best method to prevent one VLAN on a Cisco C1111-8P from intervlan routing. I have read a pile of posts (spoiler alert- I am not proficient at ALL in IOS- it's one I inherited) and I seem to get a different answer each time.
 The configuration is dead nuts simple- single WAN, 2 vlans. I want VLAN A to get anywhere, but I want VLAN B to ONLY be able to access the internet WAN, not VLAN A.
 Over simplified, yes- but you get it. And I know it's an extremely easy solution- I just can't seem to wrap my head around it using access lists, etc so I am really hoping someone is willing to hold my hand. I haven't had to muck around in a Cisco for about 10 years.
 This is in a production environment, with a permit all access list for each VLAN so I really don't want to start to mess around and put the place into a tail spin. I just think the answer is in there somewhere. I tried to convince them to source a guy who knows Cisco better than I, but they want me to do it. I know I can, I am just really, really rusty- so I am reaching out for a little help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, we are an exchange online hybrid environment and I'm having an issue with one user who is not able to access public folders via the Microsoft 365 Outlook client. When clicking into any public folder- the user gets a message that says "Cannot display the folder. Unknown Error" within the pane where the contents of the public folders are to be displayed. This issue started today.
 Background: 
  
User's mailbox is on exchange online 
 Public folders are hosted on exchange online.
 No one else seems to be having this issue
 New users I am creating on exchange online do not have this issue.
 No reports of other users having this issue including myself
 As of yesterday it was still working
 User is able to access the public folders via outlook.office365.com by adding the public folders to favorites on the left hand pane.
  
Solutions tried:
  
Recreating Outlook Profile and deleting the .ost file - Did not work
 Repaired Microsoft Office 365 suite - Did not work
 Set up outlook profile on two other machines within the network - Did not work.
 Set up outlook profile on a machine outside of the network - Did not work.
 Tried playing around with cached/uncached mode - Did not work.
  
I have created a ticket for Microsoft support as I'm suspecting this is one of the weird service issues that are affecting a small number of users. They haven't responded and was wondering is anyone experiencing this issue? Last thing I want to do is to recreate the person's AD account or something along those lines. There isn't a detailed error message for me to go off of and this is driving me nuts and most users within our environment rely heavily on public folders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This maybe an odd post, but I was introduced recently to a Framework laptop. I had heard of them before, but never thought about the device or looked into them. However a coworker picked one up and is evaluating it for a few weeks.
 I took a quick look and while it is pretty basic in design, it overall looks and feels like a nice laptop. Light, good keyboard and trackpad, 3:2 display (glossy but the new ones can be ordered mat), open with one finger, P series processors, and the interchangeable USBC ports is pretty slick. Top it off everything can be changed or upgraded easily.
 Downsides are there is just one size, but a 16" coming later this year, no TB ports, battery life is meh at 5-6 hours, and fans can spin up when under load.
 Curious if anyone has used these at scale or any feedback on them? It sort of reminds of a generic laptop but with a decent build quality.

 I'm going for cybersecurity and if all goes to plan, more networking stuff that was not available during my first school career.

 I'm wondering whether anyone has experience with Allied telesis and knows how to configure a WAN failover? On Cisco, I would configure an IP SLA, but this doesn't seem to be an option on AT. Is there a way, or do I have to load balance?
 I've never used Allied Telesis before so this is new to me. I've done some googling but there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of resources out there for this brand. The Allied telesis documentation is extensive, but hard to navigate, so I wouldn't be surprised if I just didn't find the correct document on how to do this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While looking at all these jobs posting for in-person work (while I'm already happily employed), I've realized a big question looms:
 What's the price differential that it would take for me to return to full-time in-person work from remote?
 I'm not really worried about people that are saying "I'll never do it", since you're already staking a claim outside the conversation. I'm more curious for those who would consider it (like me), and what factors you'd weigh into the value of that work. I'm obviously considering equal factors with work environment, on-call, benefits packages, etc.
 I think my absolute minimum looks something like this:
 ((Time To Get Ready in AM) + (Commute Time Round Trip)) * Approximate OT Hourly Rate * 250 work days PLUS vehicle costs for that year.
 So for example, a $72k remote job, to move in person with a 30 minute commute each way would really need:
 ((1 hour + 1 hour) * 54 * 250) + (($400 car payment + $100 insurance + $100 gas)*12)
 $34.2k more, or $106,200 total. Even then, I might be able to find that same $72k remote for $95-100k remote and maintain my valuable personal time.
 What about you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm encountering a strange problem with TACACS+ that I've never seen before (or at least never noticed). When an incorrect password is entered on a client device I would expect a 'Password:' request message to be sent by the TACACS+ server, a reply from the client containing the password, and then a 'password incorrect' message back from the server. This does indeed happen, but then immeadiately afterward the client sends the password for a second time, despite me only having entered it once. This goes to happen a further two times before the server eventually sends a 'authentication failed' and it all stops. Resulting in a total of 4 messages being sent by the client containing the password (again at this point I have only entered it once). 
 This wouldn't normally be a problem except we are authenticating TACACS against AD, which locks out users after 3 incorrect password attempts. Because the TACACS+ client sends the password a total of 4 times, the users is immidiately locked out of their AD account if they enter their password incorrectly just once.
 I'm seeing the same behavoir on both Nokia and Juniper (mx, srx, qfx) clients, and have now replicated it in a lab using a completely different TACACS+ server (TACGUI) and the junos olive image. I'm also very confident it is not the SSH client as it happens with putty, secureCRT, mobaXterm, and the buildin ssh client on a Linux box.
 I'm really stumped as to what is causing these clients to send the password a total or four times, even though it has already been rejected, and the user is not entering it again. Is this expected behavoir? Can I stop it? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
 Regards,
 Frustrated Network Engineer

 Common scenario - multiple sites linked together by IPSec tunnels, segmentation firewalls, you name it. You need to allow traffic from machine A to machine B, and that passes through firewalls X, Y, and Z.
 Do you:
  
Create matching firewall policies on all devices, restricting source/dst IP & port
 Create one restrictive policy on the firewall closest to traffic source (machine A), and looser 'catch-all' rules on the other firewalls
 Create one restrictive policy on the firewall closest to traffic destination (machine B) and looser 'catch-all' rules on the other firewalls.
  
To me, "1." feels most secure, but 2 feels like the best balance between security (block bad traffic before it hits anything else in the network) and not having to triple my work.
 Thoughts?

 I'm trying to setup OSPF in a linux-lab using FRR/Quagga where I have the need to separate two areas but everything I've thrown at it thus far has failed - Anyone out there has any experience implementing an inter-area filter? It appears it's not an unheard of functionality (see this post: https://packetlife.net/blog/2010/feb/10/ospf-filtering-inter-area-vs-intra-area/) but I haven't successfully managed to implement the filter-list parameter thus far...
 It would also appear that the received wisdom of the internet would be that in case you're in need of route filtering, BGP would be the preferred setup but I'll be running that as an external protocol and would, for curiosity's sake, prefer not to implement it as an internal protocol. :)
 Any assistance would be appreciated. Surrender is definitely an option.

 Is there some routing somewhere in Azure that can be modified to allow this traffic? Capturing traffic at the firewall, I can see traffic exiting the firewall on the tunnel interface to Azure, but nothing in reply.

 Edit #2: this is some of what I did previously...
 SSL cert updates
 Set up scheduled task with PowerShell scripts,
 IIS configuration
 Configured SCCM update roll outs
 Configuration management
 managing production servers
 Set-up Azure VDI
 Group policy management
 ​
 Edit #3: the new position seems to be heavy on cloud platforms, some scripting, and project work, my last job was project heavy so nothing new there. I've done some cloud stuff so fingers crossed there. My scripts are low shelf but mostly functional.

 I was wondering if there are any good next steps I should follow.
 Our team has uninstalled the desktop app from all our endpoints, but is there more we should be doing?
 Wondering if any updates have been put out on what cyber security teams should do to make sure there hasn't been further compromise.
 Any advice or anything thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The renewal of the data centre is imminent and this will result in some changes. Currently, all gateways of the DC Vlans are on the firewall. With the new design, we are considering whether to change this. The datacenter core will be formed by a vPC Nexus pair. The consideration is then to transfer all SVIs ( with HRSP) to the Nexus pair. ospf should then announce the routes to the Nexthop router (firewall) and vice versa. In this way, the north-south traffic can be regulated and monitored via the firewall.
 The question now is: how can I handle the east-west traffic? InterVlan communication can then no longer be monitored and regulated. One possible solution would be to use VRFs on the Nexus switches. These are then routed to the firewall via a separate transfer network.
 At the moment, the throughput of the firewall is not a problem, but since we can connect servers with higher speed due to the new hardware, there could be an increase.
 What is the best way to implement this in the data centre in terms of security? How do you do it? Maybe someone can give me some comments and recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this is better here or on a linux sub. I wanted to try here first because I think the issue is more about routes than linux. Can anyone spot an issue with my routing?
 I'm trying to set up a web app on a centos box. There are two nics, both have addresses in the dmz and the same gateway. eth1 is nat'ed to a public IP address. eth0 is used for inside traffic only. I've verified the needed ports are open to the outside using powershell Test-NetConnection. The issue is that on the outside the page hangs and then times out. On the inside lan it loads fine. 
 Initially it was the opposite. Page would load only on the internet, I added an internal route and now internal lan is the only one that works.
 I can ping inside and outside addresses from both nics. I used ifdown and ifup to verify them one at a time.
 Can anyone spot an issue that would cause outside requests to not receive a response?
 Internal design:
 10.2.1.0/24 - internal lan
 10.1.1.0/23 - dmz
 10.1.1.1 - dmz gateway
 10.1.1.54 - eth0 to internal network
 10.1.1.55 - eth1 nat'ed to public ip
 ​
 Results from "ip route" command:
 default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth1 proto static metric 101 
 10.1.1.0/23 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.1.54 metric 100 
 10.1.1.0/23 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.1.55 metric 101 
 10.2.1.0/24 via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0 proto static metric 100

 What is going on up there that requires such a dangerous task? I was just watching a video about people falling from cell towers and wonder what requires them to climb up there. I understand maybe failing equipment replacement, but are there other things that require regularly climbing up to the top?

 So I may go the way and just scramble all names and addresses. Anny ideas or a way to approach this different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this question isn't super high level, but it's a bit more complex than r/iphone would be able to help with. 
 At my job we had a bunch of iPhone users lose a good portion of their contacts. We have corporate Gmail and originally their email/calendar/contacts were set up in iOS Mail using Activesync. Everyone assumed that this information was a 2-way sync, i.e. for example a contact entered manually on the phone would automatically sync up to the cloud, and any change they made in the cloud contacts would sync down to the phone. Seems like this was not the case though and manually-entered contacts were only getting stored locally on the phone, yet they were still attached to the contact list associated to the Activesync account.
 Recently the Messaging Team decided to phase this out and have everyone use the Gmail app instead. Problem is someone accidentally cut off the Activesync access before End User Support had a chance to migrate their data. Users started getting a persistent prompt to update their password, but this didn't work because the account was gone from the system essentially. People got fed up and just deleted the account, this process does not offer any option to keep stored contacts, you have the ability to either Erase or Cancel.
 Now in the texts and other apps there are phone numbers with no name attached. In some cases it's hundreds/thousands of contacts. Is there any recourse to get these back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company recently experienced its second data breach in the past six months. All the information I’ve received so far is hearsay, but it seems that upper management is considering outsourcing security to a third party company and firing the internal security team. It’s been almost two weeks since the incident stopped, but we are all somehow still employed.
 The team was advised by the C-Suite that we are primary witnesses to the incident and that we may be involved in the litigation process from customers. It seems that I may be questioned by lawyers in the future based on my testimony. We have been asked to prepare a statement and timeline of the work we have completed near the incident.
 I’ve completely given up on having any future with this company and I am doing just what I need to do to stay on payroll as long as possible while I look for another job. I do not trust anything my employer says/does.
 Has anyone ever had to testify on behalf of their company? Do I really have to? 
 Would the statement I create affect my future unemployment claim? Also, if this goes legal, does this mean my job has a reason to keep me on payroll longer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a customer running QuickBooks 2023 on a RDS that is also a DC. I know it isn't ideal, but its a single-server environment. Its also a hosted VM. If you are one of those "QB doesn't work on a VM" people, please do not respond to this thread. It normally works fine, I have many customers on this scenario, including other DC/RDS combo VMs and the only issue is the conflict with the DNS server service. 
 Anyone familiar with this topic knows there are two fixes to the service conflict:
 1 - netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange commands
 2 - script having the QuickBooksDB## service start BEFORE the DNS Server service
 ​
 OK, so hopefully we're on the same page here. Now to the NEW issue.
 For this customer, an earlier version of QuickBooks was working fine with the script-service-start-order workaround, for years. Then we upgrade to QuickBooks 2023. I know the number in the service name changed, I accounted for that. 
 The new issue with QB2023 is not that the QuickBooksDB33 service doesn't start - it does. The issue is severe slowness in the QuickBooks program when the DNS Server service is running. Stop that service, QuickBooks runs well again. I have tried the excludedportrange commands (yes for the dynamic port listed in Database Service Manager) and port 8019, both TCP and UDP. I have tried the "starting services in the proper order" workaround, this does not work either. 
 I've researched and beat up on this issue for hours. Asking other Redditors is my last attempt before telling the customer they need two hosted servers so I can move the AD roles and DNS off of the RDS. Has anyone else experienced this with specifically QuickBooks 2023 on a DC?

 What is the best platform to learn EVPN on in a virtual environment? I was thinking I should get some cisco CSRv's going but this can get rather resource intensive.
 Is there a better alternative to learning EVPN on a virtual platform? Preferably cisco, but I am open to alternatives.
 I have had a setup with Cumulus networks and their virtual appliance, but the problem there was the fact that in my opinion it's a very niche player with little adoption in the real world.
 Preferably something that can be run in VMWare or EVE-NG, if at all possible.
 Any recommendations?

 So Server 2012R2 is still occasionally receiving Edge and Chrome updates to the 109 build.
 The last one was 7 days ago, and they will continue until Oct EOL (or hopefully longer through the ESU period)
 https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=edge%20109.0.1518.95 
 So nessus is still reporting that we need to go to the latest version (which isn't possible on 2012R2), it seems to ignore these 109 security updates which are clearly combating new critical vulnerabilities. The trouble is, Microsoft doesn't seem to give any details on these stealth 109 updates and what CVE's they resolve.
 Is this ultimately a nessus reporting issue or a MS one - in regards to the lack of information about 109 updates and how they are managed/logged in the future?

(Billing app was made by his "IT genius" son that works as a music teacher and his app is a pile of crap).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I have a probably simple question about IP address management but I am very new to networking so I am grateful for answers.
 So if I have a Class C network e.g. 192.168.0.0 with all kind of devices (notebooks, printers, IoT etc). Is it good enough to give static IPs to some devices on my DHCP server and leave the rest dynamically allocated or is it recommended to also use subnets e.g. with subnet mask 255.255.254.0 to then potentially have 4 subnets
 192.168.0.0/26 192.168.0.128/26 192.168.1.0/26 192.168.1.128/26
 so I can give devices in different subnets? What would be the advantages of that? Is this more secure and faster? Or am I thinking wrong and I do need VLANs to have those advantages? I know I can use both in that they do not exclude each other because they act on different layers. But other then that I am a little confused.
 I am very helpful for any links and resources to learn more about this topic or any hints what is best to do. I am not fully understanding the implications here yet I guess.
 Many thanks in advance!

 Looking in intune I noticed that I've done a configuration profile for it some time ago but in each of those devices the configuration result as "non applicable".
 So I've spent a good 15 minutes googling for the cause and find some workaround.
 On MS site I didn't find nothing meaningfull rapidly so.... I switched tab to chatGPT and I've asked him (or her) about this behaviour.
 The answer has been quite rapid and usefull. I'll not past it here cause it out of the scope of this post.
 ​
 And this is only an example. Let's say, I know it is good for programming, but I've used it also for commercial support like:
 ChatGPT what are some switch models that meet this requirements ?Can you suggest me more models ?Ok, now, from all the models you have suggested me, what is the cheaper ?

 We're currently in the process of moving away from Sophos to Microsoft 365 Defender for all of our fleet, and my question is whether I am able to combine onboarding methods without running into any issues? 
 Current thinking is to continue onboarding via SCCM and Intune, but then I'm hopng to also deploy a GPO to catch any machines that aren't communicating back, or for those servers and other edge cases that have been kept off management systems intentionally. In these instances, the GPO would likely hit machines that have already been onboarded via one of the methods above. Has anybody run into any issues doing it that way?
 Side question... for the "local script" onboarding method, Microsoft states that it has been optimised for ten machines only, due to some settings that expidite telemetry data from the machines, so suitable for pilot groups only. Is there a version of this that I can run that would just onboard them with the standard settings in the other packages? My google skills appear to be lacking...
 Thanks all! May your Friday be peaceful.

 I tried registry fixes, Powershell scripts but nothing worked but...
 it was HP Wolf Security. The user had it installed for 3 months and it just now started being a problem after the update.
 So to anyone who is looking for a potential fix - it might be that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Recently in our Win11 estate (latest versions via GPO) has started to 'lose' user files and folders in the OS. These have been discovered in TreeSize (run as local admin) in hidden folders named 'found.000', 'found.001' etc. These directories are not visible to the OS even with hidden folders enabled. In some instances, it's possible to cut/paste files back to the original locations (with associated integrity checks) but in other cases there are several TBs of files and folders lost and in most cases renamed with an appended number.
 I understand that these are chkdisk fragmented files or they have been moved by chkdisk. Is there a method or utility to restore these files and directories and 'fix' the issues that chkdisk identified without a manual trawl through?
 The scale is such that I would consider a commercial software solution.
 Many thanks.

 I am looking for some assistance in an issue we've had for a while where I work. I'll try and describe it as best as I can not to waste your time.
 ​
 We have been experiencing issues with websites timing out for a while now. It is sporadic and doesn't happen on any particular websites. It can be one website sometimes, then it works fine 5 minutes after, and then five minutes after the website working before, times out now. One thing that seems consistent is when a website times out, it seems to be able to load afterwards.
 ​
 There is no real other network impact, internal seems to be fine, servers seem to be running fine internally. 
 Pinging is no issue, NSlookup is no issue.
 I've noticed that when trying to load a website, it may be very slow but connecting anyway. In Devtools it will have a stalled time on 15+ seconds and the rest seems perfectly fine.
 We have a setup of 4 MS250, 2 MS425, 2 MX84. Everything is completely firmware updated and have tried restarts just to make sure. 
 We've had 2 different network consultants come and have a look at it, with no luck. I've written to our ISP but the issue seems to be non existent when connecting directly to our Edge router, so they're positive the issue is at our end, and the consultants are positive the issue is at the ISP end. 
 We are at a loss, and this is why I turn to reddit in my final hour of sanity. To hopefully find the hero who has the answer to my prayers.
 Thank you.

 I'm watching the debug logs and I'm confused as to what I'm seeing. Here's the text dump: https://pastebin.com/4buTg5sJ
 From what I can see, do I have a couple of clients on VLAN 19, that are already assigned IPs of 10.1.19.182 and 10.1.19.166, that are still continually requesting new IP addresses multiple times a second?
 Or is something else going on here?

Other then that I basically replaced keyboards, dealt with end users, changes ink cartridges, and did some phone VOIP zoom provisioning.

We recently combined with another company in another state. They have Palo Alto HA and we have Sophos HA. Replacing our 13 year old Sophos is on the table. We'd also like a better VPN system. We use OpenVPN (hate the DNS registration issues because of separate DHCP, etc). They use Global Protect which doesn't stay connected at the logon screen when switching users. We'd love to get a better VPN system as well but I don't think we want a subscription based hardware device, etc.
  
Are there any alternatives to VPN that would allow an application to communicate through an office network and across the vendor T1 line? Zero Trust is such a buzz word but I don't think any of the turn key solutions work for this.
 If VPN is still needed, what is the best option these days?
 Should we keep users split to connect to their closest office 100/100?

I am fairly new to networking.(migrated from helpdesk)) One of my tasks is to clean the configuration of branch office routers. Most of them have outdated configs, especially regarding zone-based firewall rules. Now I am trying to go through all routers and to understand how they were designed(from a zone-based firewall perspective)(there is no proper documentation - so I have to reverse engineer this thing) . Is there any easier way to do this? Most of the time I end up with paper and a pan and I try to do draw a scheme. Any suggestions? Is there software out there that can map this stuff.? I could suggest buying it if it would provide a better way to document everything.

 If the traffic in the reverse direction has no marking, how does our network on the return trip know to prioritize it? If it's supposed to be marked from their cloud systems back to us for prioritization it's essentially not being prioritized from them to us. Is this the right logic? Please drop some insight, it would be appreciated.

 The issue is often electricians will undercut our prices, sometimes just the convenience of a single supplier doing both electrics and structured data cabling at the same time is the desirable factor.

 I actually assumed everything is ok until the senior came in from holiday to see that I messed something up. All the sales people were freaking out and I suspect tomorrow I might be having some conversations. They were calling some other vendors to see if they have issues on their end and even our director got involved. For the first time I felt true outage panic mode and I suspected it would be my fault, which only made it worse.
 I knew something like this would eventually happen, this is a lesson I’m not forgetting any time soon. Looking forward to more fails and more lessons though!
 What was your first major F up as a sysadmin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/sysadmin,
 I'm in a bit of a dilemma here and I'm hoping to get some advice from the community. I've been tasked with data migration in SharePoint online sites, initially the "guru" admin said automation is not possible and we've all concluded that I can do this in 3-4 months, and during a couple of weeks, I was able to create a small script that can almost automate the entire process. With this script, I could move thousands of sites in just a few days, possibly even over a weekend.
 Here's my problem: I'm not sure if I should tell my boss about this script or not. On one hand, it could save the company a lot of time and resources, and I believe it's something they should know. On the other hand, I don't want to risk getting only a pat on the back for all my hard work.
 So my question is, should I tell my boss about my script? And if I do, how do I approach the conversation and ask for some sort of bonus or remuneration for my efforts?
 Some important context that I've missed out:
  
I work for a subsidiary company, they pay me and my salary is almost x3 time bigger than it was a year ago
 Theres an ongoing discussion of invoicing my time for the parent company since I've already helped them a lot and they realised that they need me. The boss I'm talking about is the lead IT from the parent company

Granted he's pretty good at tricking out his desktop theme but his 'ideas' are usually VERY bad. In this weeks drama, I have setup our DNS servers with load balancing and a 5 second health check. Boss wants to set our TTL to 6 seconds with the argument people using the site wouldn't notice the 5 second outage before the LB updates and we can be more nimble with DNS changes.
 Next up is a project manager that wants the TTL set to 12 hours so we can fix any DNS issues before anybody notices.
 I have spent 3 hours in a meeting with both of them trying explain why we want longer ttl than 6 seconds, but less than 12 hours. Once I address the ttl that's too short, the other says "great, set it at 12 hours". Then while I'm explaining why we want it less than 12 hours, the other says "great, 6 seconds",
 It's currently at 10 min because the PM's project makes alot of changes to their site and want the changes to take immediate effect for all of the public, but doesn't understand that the 12 hour TTL is completely opposite of that.
 The EE doesn't understand the additional latency of clients having fresh dns queries every 6 seconds. 
 They are wearing me down and one of the stupid ideas is going to win.

I'm attempting to place ACLs inbound and outbound on all my VLANs, but I keep running into an error that there aren't enough hardware resources. In talking to Ruckus support, it came to light that the hardware limits on outbound ACLs are much tighter than inbound ACLs. In the Ruckus world (not sure if this applies to other brands as well) inbound means traffic going into the switch from the VLAN and outbound means going into the VLAN from the switch which brings me to my question...
 Is it normal or best practice to have ACLs on each VLAN in both directions? It seemed like the most secure thing to do to me, but if switches are built with more resources available for inbound ACLs (from the VLAN to the switch), is it best practice to only use inbound ACLs? Are these Ruckus switches just garbage?
 Any help on this would be appreciated. I did do some Googling before posting here but didn't come up with much.

 A contractor left the firm and their mailbox was converted to shared and licenses removed. When they rejoined their sign in was unblocked and licenses restored however their shared mailbox was not converted back. Thus they have a mailbox in the normal admin 365 view but in exchange their mailbox shows up as shared. 
 How can I be sure these are the same mailboxes ? Or does he now have two sets ? I want to convert back to regular without affecting the user. The mailbox sizes are slightly different 300kb or so. 
 I’ll do some testing and figure it out anyway but just thought it was interesting and curious if anyone has done this before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 We use BatchPatch in combination with WSUS to handle patching of Windows Servers in our environment.
 After applying the latest patches we have seen some strange behavior relating to the recent enforcement of the DCOM changes.
 We have multiple subnets where a standalone BatchPatch "server" resides in each subnet.
 In one of the environments the BatchPatch server is unable to Check for updates, see CPU usage and so on after applying the latest updates. The target servers return the WMI Access Denied error.
 In another environment Batchpatch is able to Check for updates, see CPU usage etc.
 Using winver to check the build number, the build number is identical on the BatchPatch servers and the target servers in both environments. Windows Firewall configuration is identical, the servers are even part of the same domain, have the same GPOs applied etc.
 We have three questions and would appreciate any feedback on either one:
  
Is there something we can do to make BatchPatch continue to work? We thought it was the vendor's responsibility to make sure that their tools continue to work post DCOM hardening. And it does work, in one of the subnets as per BatchPatch documentation.
 If there is something we can do, should we avoid that due to security concerns? 
 Are there any other tools for Patch Management you recommend that work 100% post DCOM hardening? Preferably in-house/on-prem tools due to legal constraints. Must be able to schedule when the Servers reboot, automatic reboots are out of the question. The tool should preferably be agent-less but if agents are the only way (or a much better way) we'll go with anything that works. 
  
Thanks in advance!

So we get X amount of GBs per month. If we use them up we need to purchase more (that's expensive af!). I have a Fortigate 100E which does all the content filtering. Students access the Internet and internal resources through a Aruba 505 cluster.
 We have enough data quota but these kids are using different kinds of VPN software to circumvent firewall restrictions. Before you ask, I have blocked all these in multiple levels (application filter, Web filter, and DNS filter). The only opened ports for them are 443, 80, and few other ports for internal systems. This setup blocks all well-known VPNs and proxy tools. But these teenage buggers always find some crappy VPN app or a proxy site that is conveniently not included in Fortigate blacklists. I usually monitor the usage patterns and identify these. Then I block them manually. It has been a game of whack-a-mole for a long time and I am getting tired. How do ya'll block these kinds of things? Is there any one-off way to do this? (policies are already in place but it's really hard to make teenagers comply with them. So before you say it, no I cannot just scare them into not using VPNs).

 The one and only reason I can think about is to be able to route a /32 public address in order to save a limited pool of addresses.
 Some might algo point that by doing it with a private prefix you don't open your gateway to the internet, but given that usually all switches/routers have firewall is this really a security measure now a days? If you think from a DDoS point of view, sure, you'll be able to target that equipment with a public address, however, with a private prefix set, one you can target the client and all the traffic would still go through the gateway anyway.

 TL;DR; Competitors sending abuses on our IP's/domains for no reason. Hosting provider said its not a problem since those abuse emails are stupid and pointless and we did nothing wrong but they legaly should have a response from me and forward it.
 So we have a 3 basic servers, one for database, two for web application. Database is closed for internet, only available localy and web applications only 80 port. I have a openvpn server on smallest vps just to have an access to servers 22 by ssh and marketing guy could have an access to database directly (Before you will scream - the guy knows what is he doing and his user have only read access on sales table). So yesterday he visited competitors website to check their prices (literally clicked 1 link and left) and they sent abuse email that someone from our network IP visited their website ONCE and he wasnt on site for 30+ secs so search engine thought it was a bad visit and could derank their website. It's not a problem for this case, but they sending abuses on weekly basis like we have pirated scripts (that I wrote myself, just some JS popups), non licensed windows (but our servers are linux based), etc.
 We cant go against them in legal field since their legal entity placed in different country and just not worth it. 
 What can we do or there any option to report it somewhere that they are sending abuse mails with no reason?

 Logging off or shutting down doesn't work as well for those users. It stays at the screen "shutting down" or "logging off".
 Gpupdate fails after several minutes with a timeout for userpolicy. There are no errors for this in eventlog.
 When logged in with a different user, everything works just fine and some users don't have the same problems on all their pcs, however some got a new pc and the issues came back. 
 I'm running AD on-prem, the users don't have much in common except being domain-users. 
 Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

 I try to wrap my head around why and how the default language for a new Mailbox is influenced. My guess is, it's probably not necessary to change the language manually every time a mailbox was created automatically. 
 Right now, we log into the usermailbox via web and set the language manually. Powershell via the set-mailboxfolderregionalconfiguration cmdlet is also an option. But I can't find a way to set, e.g. a policy for it or a tenant wide default setting. 
 Anyone here already figured it out, or am I hunting ghosts here?

 So we run both Nessus and M365 Defender scans across or estate. Nessus has identified a few machines runing an app which includes Log4J-1.2.8.jar. However the supplier states their system is not vulnerable to attack. My assumption with this is that the app doesn't use it in the live environment and maybe it was used during development for logging... but why include it in the deployment??? 
 Anyway... 
 My understanding was that if it exists on a device it has the potential to be exploited. Is this understanding correct? 
 I have our App Support asking the suppliers if it is not used, whether we can remove it without issue / voiding warranty / support. 
 Just after some clarity as to vulnerability really. 
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gotta start off with that I'm kinda ashamed to post this but google isn't helping me out at all. So what's the problem:
 In W11 if I open certain application, i can't use other applications/functions like using my browser. I can scroll in my browser but I can't type, open a new tab or even click on a page. The focus is fully on that application. If i minize the application, i can once again use my browser (or file explorer etc.). This is on my home pc. I learned to live with it since there is a workaround. Since I couldn't find a fix i thought maybe it was a "feature" of W11 and stopped researching it. 
 Now i don't know when it happened but I'm now having the same issue on my work laptop which runs on W10. Once I open up PowerShell ISE, the focus gets locked on it and i can't perform any other actions, wether that is opening file explorer or just browsing the internet. I can scroll through whatever is open but that's it. 
 It isn't focus mode (which seems to do something entirely else) and this is really disturbing my ability to perform my work. If i Google Windows locks browser, i get shit about locked screen sigh...
 What in god's name is going on here? Why are certain applications getting "on top", stealing focus and Ms/kb input? Any suggestions are welcome!
 Edit: Ctrl+spacebar doesn't fix it btw.

 I dont quite understand how i can solve the issue that the sql native client 2012 is out of support.
 Due to this Microsoft Article the client was deprecated in june 2022. But here it says, thats bundled with the SQL Server version.
 I have some "older" SQL Server like 2012 and 2014 where ne native client was the latest. But with a new installed SQL 2019 the client was installed. SSMS 19 is installed too. 
 I cannot uninstall the client via the system, because it tells me that some things could broken. 
 So, how do you solve this problem? Its just from an admin perspective not from a dev.

ansible ad hoc copy the file /etc/ohgawd.key from remote server called tsrv01 present in inventory file tsrvs to local machine's temp director. the ansible user is bob and is present on both machines using ssh keys with passwordless sudo on the target machine.
  
The result:
 ansible tsrv01 -i tsrvs -m copy -a "src=/etc/ohgawd.key dest=/tmp" --user=bob --private-key=/path/to/ssh/key --become --become-user=root --ask-become-pass --extra-vars 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3' --connection=ssh 
 How I'd do it:
 ansible tsrv01 -m fetch -a 'src=/etc/ohgawd.key dest=/tmp/ohgawd.key' -i tsrvs -b 
 This is a pretty simple task. in this case the process of making the chatgpt ad hoc command work is a hassle. tried coaxing it towards what I wanted but without any better results. And it seems spending a lot of time doing that is a waste compared to just doing it properly yourself. Or googling. 
 So, you still gotta know a little something about what you're doing.

 I don't get any output. According to the Windows Updates GUI KB5002316 is already installed. 
 If I use Get-HotFix -id KB5002316 I get a message saying the hotfix is not installed. Even though the Windows update GUI says the opposite. 
 What's the dealio? I'm confused

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I just inherited two Apache Tomcat Installations (prod and test) running on Windows Server. Since installation was done in a couple of years they received since then zero updates and running diffrent versions (9.0.31 on test and 9.0.27 on prod). Before adjusting the tomcat config itself (Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1, disable weak ciphers etc.) I would like to allign the Tomcat Versions and update them to version 9.0.73. 
 I found a couple of different ways how to do this minor update and would like to receive your feedback.
 First Approach Idea: 
  
Backup current configuration
 Remove the complete tomcat installation
 Install the new version from scratch
 Adjust configs like server.xml, web.xml etc.
 Copy from backup the relevant webapps / certificates etc.
  
Second Approach idea:
  
Backup current configuration
 Replace only the files inside the folders /bin and /lib folders
 Don't touch the rest of the config .xml Files
  
I found various diffrent approaches online from diffrent vendors and now i am litle bit uncertain how the "correct" approach would look like.

 I'm working with a network that has multiple VRFs which communicate with each other. We're considering doing some BGP aggregation.
 My question is, when we're doing BGP aggregation in this type of scenario, should we be aggregating closer to the source network? Or is there no real best practice or recommendation for where to aggregate?
 To provide some context, we have two VRFs - VRF A and VRF B - that are leaking together, and we want to aggregate some subnets from VRF A to some peer on VRF B.
 Any insights or recommendations on the best way to approach this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 So we have 1 user complaining about slow wifi (for our guest wifi) and there are about 5 APs on this site. Slowness observed while surfing the web on phone/laptop while connected to wifi.
 He is in a remote site which doesn't have too many users and is connected via layer 3 Verizon epl back to our main site.
 He says he roams around say about 30-40 ft from his desk and it is still slow. Tried rebooting the AP that he was connected to (which I was able to see from the controller) which didn't help.
 His ethernet connection (Ethernet cable connected directly to laptop) works fine so I'm guessing it has to do with the APs themselves.
 What other troubleshooting steps can I look into to diagnose the cause?
 Probably have to look into the gui of the wlc I'm guessing.
 Also we upgraded the wlc from 8.1 to 8.3 about 2 weeks back and he says the wifi has been working slow ever since then.
 Right now we have only 1 wlc functioning in standalone which used to be 2 wlcs in an active standby pair before the upgrade as we ran into some complications. Will attempt to upgrade the other wlc tomorrow with Cisco support and get them back to the active standby cluster setup as it was originally. Don't think the wlc being in standalone could be causing any issues though as we have 40 other APs (also upgraded to 8.3) and have no issues with those in terms of speed of browsing for clients, etc.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE: The issue turned out to be FEC (Forward Error Correction). Setting it to off on the FS switch solved the issue.
 Devices involved: MikroTik ccr2216-1g-12xs-2xq router + FS.com N8560-48BC switch
 Cables:
  
FS.com S28-PC01 (Cisco coded)
 
FS.com S28-PC02 (Cisco coded)
 
Mikrotik XS+DA0001
 
Unspecified DAC from our DC
 
FS.com SFPP-PC02 (Cisco coded)
 
 Issue:
 Both the MikroTik and the FS.com switch consistently see the transceivers for each DAC cable. 
 However, no link is ever established. When a connection is made in loopback (from router to router or switch to switch) with these same cables, they seem to come up just fine, so cable compatibility should be okay, but it's like the FS switch or the MikroTik just don't care that they should be connecting.
 Tried the following:
  
Setting negotiation to off on both sides + setting duplex and speed manually
 Leaving negotiation on and everything negotiating
 Forcing transceiver type on the FS switch transceiver 25GBASE-COPPER
 Rebooting the switch at various points, rebooting the router at various points
 Upgrading the MikroTik firmware
 (TODO) Upgrade the firmware on the FS switch
 All the different cables specified
 Setting VLANs on both sides

 Then tried Dell MS3220p mouse but that gets disgustinly dirty within days due to some rough rubbery plastic. 
 The only requirement besides being ambidextrous, is to be wired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/sysadmin!
 Just wanted to send a heads up about potential post-exploitation activity sourcing from 3CX Phone System’s desktop application due to automated updates that was reported by CrowdStrike through Reddit, Inc. 
 The original post can be seen here:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/125r3uu/20230329_situational_awareness_crowdstrike/
 Our SOC has observed indicators of SentinelOne quarantining 3CXDesktopApp.exe and Update.exe on March 22nd and will continue to track this as the situation develops further.
 While our SOC has observed quarantines, the good news is that Blackpoint has found no evidence of further malicious activity, successful beacons or post-exploitation commands observed.
 How to Mitigate: 
 - Uninstall 3CX from all machines until the situation is resolved 
 - If uninstalling is not a viable option, then ensure the 3CX is a version prior to 18.12.4xx for Windows and 18.11.X for Mac. 
 - In addition, check firewall records for callouts to the domains in the above report by CrowdStrike

 Multiple third-party products, tools, and services confirm that the entire TLD ceases to exist for several hours at a time, which is very puzzling. Many alerts and notifications from our vendors arrive when this happens. 
 I’ve reached out to ICANN for some information, but they are apparently not an authority for this TLD (it’s one of the newer ones that’s country-specific). 
 The registry for the domain says there’s no issue, but they aren’t testing through any US-based ISPs. My offshore team can still access our infrastructure, while myself and all our US-based customers cannot. 
 The registry’s website is also offline to all US-based traffic when this happens, since it uses the same TLD (*.et). Sites like downforeveryoneorjustme.com show their site as down when this happens. 
 Very strange. Not sure where to look for answers. Thanks!
 Update: I’m realizing that troubleshooting this issue will require more experienced folks in networking. Terms like Bogon Routes, Looking Glass, ASN, IANA, and others mentioned here are new to me. If you’re particularly experienced in this space and are available for some consulting, or on-call emergency troubleshooting next time it happens, please send me a DM. I’d like to assemble a small group that can help get to the bottom of this US-only ISP / TLD issue. Many thanks to everyone that’s commented here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I took and passed (preliminary score report) the 350-901 DEVCOR after studying for a few days in order to recertify my CCNP. I am one specialization exam away from obtaining the DevNet Professional status so what's the $300 here anyway. Let's do it.
 Now that I look at the blueprints of the specialization exams I see a huge overlap with DEVCOR. Some of them lean towards domain-specific Cisco products (NSO for SP, UCI for DC, etc) but the 300-910 DEVOPS seems to be a subset of DEVCOR, maybe with a bit more of Kubernetes (well, probably, but anyway).
 Am I underestimating the exams (and especially 300-910 DEVOPS) or are they really just meme exams to milk us for $300?

 ​
 we are in the process of evaluating Elasticflow. im setting up a vm and sending netflow v9 data to the elasticflow vm. i dont know too much about elasticflow but so far im liking it. 
 ​
 elastic flow base their prices on flows per second. now my question is where does everyone usually enable netflow with this in mind? should i enable netflow only on our core routers? should i do it also on user access switches as well? 
 ​
 i was thinking to get the best price maybe to only enable netflow on our core routers and not so much on the access switches. im sorry that this is a very vague question im still in the process of configuring it. 
 ​
 we are a cisco shop with ftds and routers internally. and if anyone has any opinions or tips on elasticflow and best practices on it i would appreciate it
 ​

 thank you!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in a couple of small ISPs and in this time have noticed two main types of networks using L3 switches:
  
All switches are in the same L2 network and are usually all in the same subnet.
 
Every switch has a specific /32 IP address on its loopback interface and every connection between these switches uses a /30 prefix for PTP on a specific VLAN.
 
 I've seen both of these scenarios using OSPF and don't know if the latter is a requirement for some kind of protocol, like MPLS. I've seen ISPs move from the first to the second scenario, but don't know why or even if this is good behavior.
 I'd assume that the latter would be more CPU intensive on the hardware and maybe add a disregardful amount of latency to the network, but what are the benefits?

 Question about Virtual Stackwise. Currently we have a single Core Switch that is running on the network. Trying to implement a secondary Core Switch to use as the Virtual Stackwise for redundancy. Primary Switch has all the configurations and I have implemented the stackwise configurations on it. On the Secondary Switch, I have implemented the stackwise-virtual and domain, SVL (learned that this is not needed in the Secondary Switch. Deleted them), and DAD link. The question is, will the Secondary Switch sync configurations that are on the Primary Switch?
 ​
 Also, how does the interface numbering work? We got 40 port CAT 9500s. Will Primary be numbered int range ten1/0/1 - 40 and secondary switch int range ten2/0/1 - 40?

 My organization is slowly moving to a new headquarters site over the next few years, which of course will entail setting up a new core. We have a temporary 3750 stack there now as we haven't gotten all of our equipment yet. The site is a six-story building (not including basement, where the core resides). IDF closets on each floor with layer 2 switches, 12 strands of fiber ran between each floor and the basement. Our current headquarters core is a chassis switch (Cat 4507), with port-channels to other buildings for layer 2 redundancy.
 I've read a bunch of posts here and elsewhere about best practice for core redundancy, and it seems like stacking (virtual stackwise in my case, as these will be 9500s) is generally considered to be less favorable to having separate management planes. What I haven't quite been able to nail down is what the right solution is to accommodate that is. I've been looking at VRRP, HSRP, and GLBP. For those with experience with any of those, which would you recommend and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 We‘re currently deploying fortiswitches at our campus and keep on getting issues with these switches. First we swapped our core layer to 1048Es. First burden was to add 4 switches to a MLAG. Its restricted to 2 switches. Then there was an issue with connecting both MlAG pair with each other. It created a loop, even tho configured as stated in their documentary and made everything to shit down. 
 Connecting distribution layer was a mess to. It looped again due to a bug with STP. Since you have no real centralized management, we had to troubleshoot on Firewall GUI, CLI and Switch CLI. You can completely forget about the Fortimanager integration. 
 Accsess layee integration got its own bugs. Since were running a split vendor environment right now, we had problems connecting the switches to the 1048Es 10gig lwl ports. Had to do some config adjustments on the old switches too. 
 Configuring these switches is verry „interesting“ too as Im used to CLI only. The CLI itself is nothing compared to Ciscos or Junipers. Though I like there firewall configuration, the switch controller GUI seems to be buggy as well. Some menues doesnt show all options so you have to increase window size to actually view everything. The topology view is buggy too as you cant even scroll in on large deployments. 
 Overall it has not been a pleasure dealing with this devices. Since we have over 2000 switches in general, I dont think this will be funny times. 
 Do you also have fortiswitches on your campus/dc and what is your opinion about them?

 I came across some readings of BGP in the Data Center, I'm pretty sure this may answer my first question. I find this very intriguing as I've never thought of BGP being used outside of ISPs. 
 I'm generally curious on the different design options being used. I tried searching for some info on AWS underlying architecture for the DC but it seems they don't really put that info out there. Would love to hear from anyone in r/networking who has dabbled into this area.

 Barracuda has left these devices out to die, seemingly. There are no updates forthcoming since a couple of years, according to my co-worker.
 A while ago, I looked at Titan and it was basically the same as Barracuda.
 It seems, nobody wants to develop mail-screening for on-prem anymore. But what's the point of SSL and end-to-end encryption, if your mail goes through a 3rd-party first anyway?

 That video surveillance monstrosity is a whole new level though or to be specific - storage for all that.
 Maybe if that's not the right place to ask someone can redirect me to appropriate sub.

 I'm starting to getting more into Networking and now have to present my first Topology to my boss to then execute it.
 Can someone give me some hints on where I can Improve ?
 ​
 Topology is as following:
 6 x Access Switches Aruba 1960 Instant ON 48G 2SFP+ 
 Attached on each:
 6x Aruba Instant On AP25
 All Switches will be connected Redundant to either (depending on deliverablitly) via 1Gig
 3x 6300F Aruba CX (due to need of SFP+ Interfaces)
 or
 2x 6300M with 24 SFP+ Interfaces (Then Link to Access will be 10Gig.)
 Aruba CX Stack will be VSX. 
 All VLAN's (About 6) will be trunked to a Sophos UTM which will be doing Inter VLAN Routing.
 ​
 Is there something I can / need to improve ?

 However, as of yesterday, I've started seeing a new type of phishing email. Instead of putting the link directly into the email body (which allows us to track and block these links via SafeLinks), they've started attaching a phishing email to the received mail, which completely bypasses SafeLinks!
 Not fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was informed that I could talk to the Cisco sales rep for quotes. I am planning to convert my current collapsed core into spine leaf architecture. My network is not that big. It is basically 1 production and the rest are tenant networks. The traffic is 95% east west and the remaining 5% is north south is when we are doing a test with other organization. We do a lot of BUM traffic and multicast. We have some instances that some tenants will run some test between them. We also do a lot of data transfer to our storage from 500GB to some TB. We have some compute nodes to process the data that got transferred.
 About a firewall, I am leaning towards Palo Alto. I have worked with PAN in the past and really liked it. 
 Anyways, I am thinking two the Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX for the spines and leaf switches. Is the 93180YC-FX good candidate for spine?
 I would like to use VRF-lite to each tenant/lab. We currently have 8 tenants and growing. At the moment, I am still wrapping my head around how I can get the two tenants to connect to each other via L3VNI. What is the typical way of doing this?
 About the firewall, I am still trying to figure out the best place to deploy it. Reading some Spine leaf docs, it seems the firewall is usually located at the border leaf. And the Upstream network is on a VRF-lite. Some says use the firewall to route between tenants. The global table seems to be just the fabric. Am I understanding this correctly?
 I would like to use my C9300 as an access switches and use VRRP between the local leaf switches. Is this even a valid design in the real world?
 Does the leaf need to be in vPC if I were to do VRRP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of a rant, but I'm just wondering: I work for a small company with 700 users and 15 offices. We have 65 VMs (VMware environment) spread across multiple locations, Cisco switches, Fortigate firewalls and APs, UPSs, EMC SANs, Dell servers, Veeam Backup, Wasabi, SharePoint, OneDrive, O365 Mail (hybrid), Power BI, and 100 iPads (with a subpar MDM). The list could go on and on, and my point here is that we have only one IT director, one system administrator/network administrator/security person (me), and three helpdesk folks. One of the helpdesk people is amazing, but the other two just float by.
 My question is this: I've been here for 8 years, and I've noticed that we get zero training, everything is a dumpster fire that needs to be put out, management doesn't listen to important security changes that need to be made, and there are no policies in place, such as an email policy, internet policy, BYOD policy, etc. (I have sent all of these to management and HR for approval, but they just don't write back.) The culture here, as in the people, is great; I've never worked with such an array of awesome people. However, they don't seem to care about any structure or advancement of learning of any kind. I just constantly feel behind the eight ball and can never get caught up to even have time for training. 
 Has anyone else's workplace been like this? If so, what did you do to change it?

 I need to decide to upgrade from older Cisco 2900 switches and ruckus wifi to new hardware. Its not much devices, 1 server rack with core switch and office floor switches + wlan APs. I mainly use switching and 802.1x in switches, no routing no complex functionality. Wireless setup is simple too + couple of RADIUS auths.
 I like cisco stability and ruckus wifi. I do not like cisco's lack of telemetry compared to what Arista seems to be able to offer (cloudvision)
 I do not have Arista or Extreme experience, but Arista seems to be highly praised in networking community.
 I am not sure about Arista wireless. Mojo/CUE?
 Also I am not sure Arista's lack of NAC or radius authentication of devices over wireless or LAN (correct if I am mistaken).
 I have some level of local IT partners demos done to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently getting ready for moving into a new building and I need a sanity check on my options. I'll preface this with I'm in the UK and getting stock of anything has been a nightmare since Brexit!
 New building is a training facility/office space with about ~300 data points across 2 floors. On average there's only about 70 users on site, but it peaks to ~350 with guests etc.
 I've been in talks with Aruba for a while, and they've finally given me their solution, which is 2x CX6300M and 6x CX6100 which is coming in at over £100K MSRP. Originally they spec'd CX6400 at almost £220K!
 Their issue is the lead time is 36 Weeks at best for the 6300, and 15 Weeks for the 6100.
 The second option is to go UniFi, I've already got an extensive UniFi wireless system already and we're sticking with Unifi for the wireless in the new building. I'll probably still stick with an Aruba 2930 at the core acting as the layer 3 router - I'm also looking at firewall options between Sonicwall and rolling my own PFSense on HPE server hardware for layer3 routing.
 The UniFi solution of 2x USW-Enterprise-48 and 6x USW-Pro-48-PoE is almost 1/5th the cost at less then £20K, obviously it lacks a lot of the features of the Aruba, and their Layer 3 stuff is laughably bad.But at 1/5th the cost, and being able to get it with only 1 weeks lead time, is this a good option or am I crazy?
 For the money I could by a cold spare of every Unifi switch and still be half the cost of the Aruba option.

 We are running Azure Virtual Desktop POC, and we do not have a static IP assigned to the hosts. We also use Cisco Umbrella as our proxy for users, and I would like to update the network address of the Virtual Desktops in Umbrella.
 Cisco suggest using either the Dynamic update tool, or an API.
 We can't log in to the OpenDNS dynamic update tool as we use SAML authentication, so Cisco support have suggested using the API. 
 Which is all good and well - but the API is a shell command - and I'm not sure how I can run this on a windows server as scheduled task, and ideally do not want to setup the Linux subsystem in windows on the Azure Virtual Desktops. 
 Details of the API commands are here - https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cloud-security/#!dynamic-network-update-getting-started/response-codes 
 The command they have suggested in Shell is 
 curl -i -X PUT 'https://updates.opendns.com/nic/update?hostname=<Umbrella network name>' \ -H 'Authorization: Basic %YourEncodedUsernamePassword%' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

These changes in systems are great but not much have ever been said about it. Last week someone placed a QR code which let you connect to the wi-fi network. Something very simple but so many people came to IT to compliment it. 
 So this week I've been thinking of small ease of life upgrades I could do but have been running short of ideas. So I'm turning to you, what ease of life updates have improved your users experience?

 I am in a situation that I am not really sure how to face I've never got trough all the steps of a selection process for rejecting the offer but this time i think i must. They explained me the position twice and it sound for me like the position i'm in now as deployment of software technician, but didn't detailed the work schedule and the location of the position until the last interview. Then yesterday they confirmed me that they want me for the position. They offer 6.000€ more per year than my current wage working usually on remote but required to work occasionally to a warehouse that is an hour away in by train and another 15 min walking from the station, and doesn't seem to be a comfortable place to work in, besides they haven't confirmed if would be working on shifts and weekends which would be the worst. 
 I'm not sure how to explain that the position would mean a worse quality of life for me and reject it but without losing face with the corporation which i would like be to work with in the future, or just ghosting them and saving the effort. 
 Thank you for reading, and excuse me for any grammar mistakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am browsing this subreddit almost daily and I would like to suggest a new type of post. This will have engineers giving their opinions about a (fairly) new technology that they have actually implemented and their opinion.
 An example of a valid post will be:
 - We currently have Cisco DNA Center, and backing up this product is horrible (among everything else). You can select a backup destination, an NFS mount, but it does not have the option to "keep x amount of backups" or "keep the last X backups". Upon researching, I have found a bash script written by a Cisco engineer where you put it on the NFS server (its a bash script), deleting backups older than X amount of days. I realized that if backup was failing for a couple of weeks in a row and I was on holiday or forgot to check the backups on a daily basis, that script would delete all backups. It is such a bad design.
 ​
 Examples of bad posts are:
 - Vendor X has announced technology Y. This is a marketing/sales post where it was not a tested feature.
 - I have reused my old Cisco 2950s for OoB management. This is an old way of doing things with an even older technology.

 I literally only have these 9 tablets, and dont really want to pay for software just to do that
 Does anyone know of a free software, or a way to bypass it entirely?
 Specifically what i need, is for these tablets to only be able to access a specific browser url, and to default to that url after a specific time of inactivity. I also need to be able to have the screens on permanently.
 If anyone else has any other good ideas, im open to options.

 I'm looking for someone that has a bit of Fibre Channel/MDS experience to ask about some best practice stuff.
 I've been tasked with replacing our old Nexus FC switch(s). we have a pair of them with each server/storage with duel HBA's into each switch. I'll be using Cisco MDS 9148T's to replace the Nexus box's.
 The part that has thrown me, is although there is a port-channel trunk setup between the switches they have different vsans on each switch (trunk only allows their vlan so the neighbour switch will drop)... this would technically still work but i cant help but think it isnt best practice? 
 i would have thought you have both switches configured with the same vsan and a trunk between them? 
 If anyone has any examples of best practice for this senario it would be much appricated. 
 TL:DR - How should i configure 2 resilient FC switches with each server/storage having a connection to both switches.
 Thanks!

 I can get the scheduled task to deploy fine however on a handful of devices I am seeing that they are all failing with a 0x1 last run result.
 And on the history tab I am getting a "Task scheduler successfully completed task ....... with return code 2147942401

 I am explicitly calling out the powershell executable -

 And also calling the script using the -command parameter instead of -file as initially I was having issues getting task scheduler to parse the parameters properly with -file

 On the trigger end I am specifying "System"
 And for it to run whether user is logged on or not
 The task is configured for windows

 I also saw online that people are having issues with 22H2 and credential guard potentially causing it

 I am using a Logi mouse and a Logi keyboard, both are bluetooth/wireless. I have a M1 MacBook Pro which can only connect to 1 external display. I am likely buying a new X1 Carbon which can connect to 2 external displays.
 Ideally I can have 4 screens on my desk: the 2 laptops and 2 external displays. This means one of the two external displays will be shared by both laptops. How can I switch it to read from one laptop and to the other laptop? This also means I will need a switch for the mouse and keyboard too. What is the best way to do this with the least amount of wires and least number of steps in daily operation?
 Additional information for use case: the M1 Macbook Pro will likely be used as a desktop while the X1 Carbon will often be unplugged and taken out as a laptop and plugged back in again when home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in IT for a municipality and we are about to start a printer refresh. I am looking for examples of how different organizations are doing it. All of our printers have been in place for almost 10 years, I am taking this opportunity to hopefully standardize and improve the naming convention. If I can get examples of current names and why they are named that way I would greatly appreciate it.
 Edit 1: to provide an example of what we are doing, the printer refresh walkthrough revealed 324 printers, we have managed to reduce that down to 300. There are departments that have a single location like one suite and is somewhat simple, there are others that have multiple locations throughout the city. We currently have the implementation of the Follow-me printer and have many staff that use it as was suggested in the comments. One example I can provide is the Police Department and the many building they occupy and the multiple units within their headquarters, for instance I’ll make a couple up just for example: PD-224MFP01 or FIN-MFP02, for the first example Police Department/building/Multi-Function Printer/1st out of 2 printers. The next is simply Finance/Multi-Function printer/2nd out of two.

 VMWare or Hyper-V?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warning about using BitTitan for Office 365 migrations for a while 
 I started a small On prem exchange to O365 migration ( 20 users ) last Monday with the goal of a Friday cutover 
 We have been unable to get step one the destination verififcation to complete. Many support emails with repetitive circular responses. Support didnt read previous notes or look at screenshots proving impersonation was in place. Just kept sending the same 3 or 4 answers to various changing verification failures. 
 I begged for a phone call or to be escalated. Now that Ive missed 2 cutover appts and burned LOTS of time that I cant ( or wont ) bill the customer. I asked for a refund so I could try another tool.
 Now they offer to escalate and send this along 
 "This error comes up regardless of whether the tenant has a secret key or not. It's a new error that we have very limited information about. This has been escalated and our dev team is working on a permanent solution. Meanwhile, what we have so far is this - Most Common Errors Encountered in MigrationWiz while using Modern Authentication for EWS in Exchange Online."
 the link is the same link they have sent at least 3 times before, Ive replied with screenshots proving that Ive done those things. And worse, they admit its an issue they cant figure out, but are still willing to send that same link to further waste my time. 
 Oh and they ignore the refund request
 At this point I would pause using BitTitan for migrations with O365 as the end point...
 Not sure if my bank will let me reverse the CC charge ... 
 Rant off

 It pays only $23 hourly. That is more than what I make, but I work remotely. The only benefit to me would be putting system admin on my resume.
 I was told some of the job would be answering phone calls and some would be working with servers and stuff. They didn't go too in depth. Asked if If had any AWS experience, I said no only azure.

 Was curious if anyone knew anything about this type of situation... Long story short, we have a massive Core Cisco Switch (Like 60 Ports or something like that... Its stacked). And we have 2 ISP's at our office.
 Those ISP Connections plug directly into the Core Cisco Switch. 
 On the Switch we have 2 specific VLAN's that utilize like 5 Ports a piece. 
 ISP 1 Equipment Plugs into Port 1 Which is VLAN 4... Ports 2, 3,4, 5 are also VLAN 4.
 So, Port 1 pulls ISP 1 Connection to it.. And then blankets ports 2, 3, 4, 5 with that ISP Connection.
 ISP 2 Equipment plugs int Port 6 Which is VLAN 9... Ports 7, 8, 9, 10 are also VLAN 9.
 So Port 6 pulls ISP 2 Connection to it.. And then blankets port 7, 8, 9, 10 with that ISP Connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of architetcting a solution for a 12 VPC enterprise that is looking to add a new VPC that is secured by a virtual Palo.
 The other 12 VPC's are currently interconnected via VPC Peering. 
 This new VPC will be one which hosts instances that mange products in the other VPC's, so think development, dev OPs, etc. 
 Now, using a transit gateway in this new VPC would be easy to route traffic in and out of VPC. But my question now is with the other VPC's.
 I understand I'd have to connect VPC(13)'s transit gateway with a transit gateway populated in the other 12 VPCs, but would this transit gateway overwrite the prior legacy VPC Peerings? 
 TL'DR
 building new VPC that needs to connect to 12 other VPC's. 
 the 12 vpc's connect to each other via peering.
 want to leverage transit gateway on VPC 13.
 will doing transit gateway for VPC 13 to the other 12 VPC's break the original 12 VPCs' peering?
 Can i use transit gateway for VPC 13 to other 12, but keep peering within original 12?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am currently working on deploying a second core switch to be in sync with our current live core switch on the network. I am doing this so that our network can have redundancy and decided to go with Virtual Stackwise technology. I think I have configured the switches correctly but they are not synching. Right now due to physical limits between our locations, only one of the SVL can be connected. I was thinking that the DAD link and the second SVL interface can wait until we have more fiber panels put into our buildings (it will be soon). Will not having the DAD link connection up cause the two switches to not sync? Also, do you need to configure the second core switch to have configurations or just applying the stackwise configuration will have it pull configs from the original switch?
 ​
 These are the configs I implemented into the two switches. Currently, only interface 1/0/39 from each switch are physically connected to one another.
 Core Switch 1 Config:
 stackwise-virtual
 domain 101
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
 description Link_To_MIL-B80-CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/39
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/40
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW2
 ​
 Core Switch 2 Config
 stackwise-virtual
 domain 101
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 stackwise-virtual dual-active-detection
 description Link_To_MIL-B80-CoreSW2
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/39
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW1
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/40
 stackwise-virtual link 1
 description To CoreSW1
 ​
 Edit: doing 'show switch' on CoreSW1 shows that it's the only device. On CoreSW2, it shows itself as switch 2 and it's active (I configured it to be switch 2) and Switch 1 is provisioning (on this switch there is no MAC address or any info.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 So as the title says, I have been at this job for one year and after six months of working here my manager quit, leaving me as the sole IT person for the company. I hit my one year mark and begged for a year review since I had been doing all the IT on my own for six months with it seeming like they were never going to replace him.
 They decided to promote me to IT Manager and gave me a 20% raise! 
 But now the imposter syndrome is setting in, with this newly appointed title I'm just not too sure where to start.
 For context, this is a small post house for a media entertainment company, we only have 10 full time employee's, but we do have a rotating staff of about 20 artists and producers.
 Can any IT management or people in similar positions give me some advice on steering this ship smoothly?
 I started IT in 2020 as helpdesk for about a year then moved to jr sysadmin, so I feel like I'm not qualified, however I'm very grateful and excited for this opportunity and want to do my best. 
 Luckily there is a decent amount of down time, so if anyone has any material I should read or watch, I'd love the recommendations.
 Thanks!
 Edit: this negativity is bussin bussin

 It is straightforward where I have two interfaces active and doing neighborship and the rest are passive interfaces to advertise their subnets.
 I received a request to block one of the passive-interface (irb.16 / 10.10.10.0/24 ) subnet from being advertised to the neighbor that is forming on (irb.5). I can not remove the passive command from interface irb.16 since it will stop being advertised to both neighbors and not our goal.
 What is the easiest way to block this subnet (10.10.10.0/24) where I can apply it to the neighbor on irb.5 only?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new department is going up and I was asked by our project team to supply infrastructure specs. I'm mainly a network admin that maintains and manages devices.
 Am I supposed to know fire stop code or the distance between my network cables and electrical cables. 
 At most the direction I can think of is a 48ru cabinet to support (size/depth of our switches) and space for the patch panels. 
 Our shop also requires a specific cable manufacturer for copper, so I include that and that the cables have to pass testing (poe, continuity and grounding), 
 cable trays to be installed hanging from the ceiling (but am I supposed to specify the size of a j hook or that it must be bolted and secure?)
 Bundles must be secured with velcro.
 Service loop for 1m at each end of termination.
 Cables shouldn't be more than 95m etc.
 I would love a suggestion into reading material or how I can keep up with the requirements for physical cabling. We have had many phases of construction and most of this was handled by consultants and I was never privy to the details, but now the PMs are asking me for this info and I'm a bit lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm working on a project where I need to connect a workstation in one town to a workstation in a different town. I am creating the project completely virtually (in Microsoft Hyper-V), with servers acting as routers.
 For each network, I've created a server, switch and client that can communicate with each other, but I can't seem to get them to communicate between networks. As far as I know, the only tools I can use in the scenario are Windows based, so I've been trying to use RRAS, but haven't had any luck. I don't need to worry about an internet connection at all, so I've just been attempting a static route between the servers/routers.
 I've created this diagram (https://imgur.com/a/6D4VvNZ - sorry for poor quality). I basically need a client (192.168.1.1) to talk to another client (192.168.2.1). They can both talk to their servers (192.168.1.254 / 192.168.2.254) but I can't get the servers to talk to eachother. I have two NICS on each server/router, one with the private IP address and one with the public IP address (173.15.15.x/30).
 Has anyone got any ideas where I might be doing wrong?
 Thanks in advance

 I've gotten about 10% increase over the last 3 years, but inflation has gone up 21%. So technically I have been losing value over time.
 Are you being compensated for inflation or is it being ignored?

 When Deploy-Application.exe is clicked, the UAC prompts immediately, but afterward there is roughly a 20 second delay before the Welcome message prompts wherein the user is directed to close applications and proceed. I thought perhaps the process was delayed due to copying the MSI's locally, so I removed all but two small ones and it's still the same.
 Has anyway else experienced this, and know of a workaround?
 Even if I can have a preceding "Please wait" message appear, that would work fine as well.

It was a link to our website in our email signature. The link was causing false positives for both outbound to other Microsoft tenants, and then inbound back to us. 
 In testing I could send an email containing only: https://ourdomain.com
 and it would be blocked.
 Then I'd send one with only: https://0urd0ma1n.com (or any other domain)
 and it would come right through.
 I have no idea why this is the case yet, it's a small typical website that hasn't been hacked in any way.

 My question is in terms of headaches and pricing, wouldn't it be overkill to setup VDIs for everyone including FTE? Let me know as I do not have the most experience with VDIs company wide. As my last companies stuck to VDIs for contractors and company issued laptops for FTEs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello-
 I have an application that is made of up of several servers. 2 of the servers are just typical physical servers which are dual-nic'd and plugged into a pair of Nexus 9k switches. The rest of the environment is made up of virtual machines (ESXi 7.0.3 EPP w/ vCenter). The application calls for creating a SPAN port which will monitor traffic on the 2 physical servers and then to monitor that traffic on 2 virtual machines. I am not sure how to set this up? I am good in VMware, but more of a novice when it comes to Cisco networking (or really networking in general.) Is this possible and if so, how would I go about configuring this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a mistake. Last year I took a great paying job with a soul-less corporate machine and last week it came back to bite me as I was laid off at a fairly bad time to be laid off in this industry. Several other corporations in my area also laid off IT workers saturating the market. Now with the "recession" very few are hiring. I have applied to over 130 positions in LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, etc... in the past week but all I have heard back were head hunters and rejection letters. 
 I understand this is all part of the process and with my skillset I will find somewhere to land eventually, but its hard to keep my thoughts positive when the livelihood of my family are on the line. I am 4 years from paying off my house so I really do not want to move as my mortgage is 1/3 that of renting a 3 bedroom house just about anywhere in the country right now. This has lead me down the road of looking for Full Remote jobs, and let me tell you, they are crazy... 
 Advertised as Remote Work - (But you must live 30 minutes from our office, and come into the office 3 days a week), or you must live in the same state or you are immediately rejected. The rejection letters are nice to have, but each one is like adding another brick into the pile I am carrying into depression. 
 Then there are the fake jobs, the MSPs posing as real jobs, the scams, the head hunters that want you to scan your Drivers license and Social Security card to them... Yah right buddy. 
 ​
 I just want to work on someone's network making it better for a decent wage.

 ​
 -MSP friendly, can cover multiple customer environments and keep them separate
 -Can monitor external (Monitor customer's ISP connection, up/down)
 -Can monitor customer's site-to-site VPNs that connect customer's sites together
 -Can monitor customer's internal network equipment (routers, switches, wireless APs)

 We've tried using guides such as Deploy Intune Printer Drivers | PnPutil | Printbrm | PrnDrvr (call4cloud.nl) to deploy the printer through Intune but it keeps failing. Most likely the way we've packaged the drivers is incorrect.
 Just taking a chance here in case anyone else has Sharp-printers and have a nicer way of deploying them either via GPO or Intune?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm struggling to understand a concept our MSP has described as the reason staff using MRP and lightweight CAD programs are getting slow speed
 ​
 We have 1gb leased line symmetrical and an Sophos XG firewall running SSL VPN via the Sophos connect app. Before this, we had 300/100mb running off on old Draytek running L2TP. I can't say if MRP speeds are faster as we have only had the MRP system recently so it was just being implemented when the lines switched, , but the CAD stuff would work almost as quickly as if onsite
 ​
 Now, what takes milliseconds onsite is taking 20 or so seconds (this is just opening windows, no manipulation of the MRP/CAD files). Speaking to our MSP, they have said that it's due to the XG overhead on processing and routing the data. But I genuinely struggle to see it slowing speed down so much. Especially as the CAD stuff worked file over L2TP 
 If correctly configured, should we be seeing such delays over VPN? Onsite, everything is fine. The MRP and CAD software are hosted on SQL instances inside the network. I assumed there was traffic shaping of packet inspection turned on, but they say no
 ​
 Am I going mad??!?!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to hear your opinions and best practices how to securely send out new usernames and initial passwords to about 1000 external users. 
 My first guess was to make the announcement of the account migration, tell them the new format to figure out the username themselves (it's just firstname.lastname@domain) and send each an email with just the password without further context, so the information from one email is not enough. If I could encrypt the emails, it would be perfect, but I don't have the users public keys, as they are external. Though I have limited knowledge about email security, so please educate me. 
 Is there another way to get the passwords to the users securely or is it "good enough" to just send them separately? (Passwords need to be changed upon first login.)
 Thank you! 
 Disclaimer: I'm not the one responsible for the user migration, I just administrate the first service that wants to use the new AD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is largely an experimental process, somewhat proof of concept, somewhat applicable to our work environment, either way it's my first time working with enterprise images.
 Basically I've been tasked with building a standalone media console, and I've been given some creative license to see exactly how much I can do with it. So far I've managed most of what I need to do without much issue, but I'm running into some confusion when it comes to the Custom Logon and embedded boot features on enterprise. To a degree this is a (multi-app) kiosk deployment, we don't want it especially obvious that it's running windows, so we want to suppress all the boot UI and windows logon UI with autologin to a locked down account, we have an application we want to use for the shell in place of explorer and lock down any breakout keys.
 I've made a few custom images and managed to sort out all the users and automated oobe features I need, now I'm moving onto the lockdown/embedded features portion. Pouring through the documentation on all the customlogon and embedded features from Microsoft, I'm not getting much of a direct answer as to when and how to deploy them, has anyone here worked with them before?
 Will these deploy properly if they're apart of an answer.xml configured in WSIM and installed from a custom image? Do they need to be configured in WinPE and built into the image from there? Can they be implemented to the OS from a provisioning package after initial deployment?
 Any help is greatly appreciated

 I'm having a big headache trying to work out how Microsoft licensing works for our Hyper-V implementation, especially with regard to SQL server.
 We have two independent Hyper-V clusters, each consisting of 3x 32-core single CPU hypervisors. Under normal operation our VMs are distributed between the two clusters. In a disaster scenario, we can manually bring up the VMs from one cluster onto the other.
 What I want to find out is:
  
Do I need Windows Server licenses for each guest VM, or just for the physical hypervisors?
 If I want to run a 4-vcpu SQL server VM on one cluster, what SQL license do I need to buy?
  
I asked the person inside our org who I consider to be the most Hyper-V expert and they said that they run physical SQL servers to avoid having to think about this...
 If anyone can help me figure it out I'd be most thankful. We already have enough server datacenter licenses with SA to cover our current VM load if it is one license per VM, but I'd like to know this for sure...
 Thanks!

I've got a use case where its a small operation (<50 users) with a full 365 system running business standard licenses for all users. 
 A few years ago I migrated our physical PBX system into the cloud, and it works just fine, but as the integration into the microsoft environment has gotten smoother, i'm investigating the option of moving from a third-party VOIP to skype for business. 
 I know microsoft has mostly good documentation, but i'm more interested if anyone here uses skype in a similar environment and what your feedback/experience has been. I'm asking here because I'm not interested in a sales pitch, i want to know what it's like from people who manage it or at the very least built/configured it into your organization.

 This worked as intended on a previous laptop, but it always seems to jump to 'ItIsntHere' when ran at login on this laptop. If I run the batch file manually it's working as intended, it just isn't working properly at login. I've tried added delays and that hasn't made a difference.
 I think the next step would be instead of checking for the NAS, checking if an ethernet connection is present or not - how would I set up a check for this?

 we recently renewed our HyperV Cluster - as in:
  
replacing some older nodes
 Upgrading them all from 2012r2 to 2016 
  
The SAN disks are mounted on those nodes under 
  
C:\some_random_example_folder\
  
In the past (Win2012 days) we enabled bitlocker for the C: drives of all HyperV nodes - which never affected the mounted disc from the SAN.
 Now after switching from 2012 to 2016 and adding some new nodes - i am wondering: is that still the same with 2016? 
 Can i easily enable Bitlocker on those new nodes for C:\ without affecting the C:\some_random_example_folder\ mounted SAN disks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I´ve had some issues surrounding blocking the access to the admin console to the Dream Machine for a "Guest" VLAN.
 Following many guides and some common sense I have already blocked all access to other VLANs and to the IPs of the Gateway (Dream Machine). Additionally I have blocked all Port 22, 80 and 443 Connections to those IPs, but I can still access every single IP of the Dream Machine.
 ​
 Let´s say I have the
 - IoT VLAN 172.27.0.0/16
 - Default VLAN 172.16.0.0/16 
 Gateways are .1
 ​
 - Blocked access for clients in IoT to both Gateway IPs (for testing, since it does not work)
 - Blocked access for clients in IoT to ports 22, 80, 443 on both Gateway IPs
 ​
 I still get through to the admin console on the Dream Machine via every IP (172.27.0.1 & 172.16.0.1) whenever I try it from the IoT VLAN :(
 ​
 I would appreciate some help from anybody with some more experience :)

 Weird thing is, in outlook web and on mobile this works fine and we get all emails, even the ones that were sent before we changed address.
 I have tried to create a new outlook profile and rebuild the search index, but i get the same result. Cant find anyone with a similar issue.

Thinking there was another member, it would be a hand in hand working environment, turns out i will be the sole sysadmin, no one to guide me around their system that im expected to know. My problem comes in when they said they'll be outsourcing their work from other countries by offering their pc as a service to them. They want to restrict them from copying data / files from their pc and would only allow them to use the graphic design software. I'm overwhelmed and i am not sure where to start. Any advise and tips would be greatly appreciated. 
 Also going to setup a home lab, so if you could advise with what softwares to use as well I'd be more than grateful!

 What would you recommend as a good course of action? Should I remove the computer from the domain, for example, and add it again with the same computer name? If I do that will the user lose access to his domain profile?

 we've run into some strange behaviour at a client's DC. They recently moved to another office and finally made the choice to put some money into new server hardware, so we migrated their Srv2016 DC from an old ESXi to a new one. We didn't do a V2V (for various reasons) but chose to simply make a final Veeam backup and restored it as a new VM on the new host.
 At first boot the machine went into safemode (with AD repair) as we've expected. So we logged on, changed boot behaviour back to normal and rebooted several times to check if it's running correctly.
 Now, ~2 weeks later, users complained they didn't have access to a share anymore.
 So we've tried to login on the DC using our Domain Admin user and realised it isn't working. Screen says "user can't login due to account restrictions or maybe wrong characters in password - as a blank". That's nonsense. So we tried to login using the local admin account and there it says the account would have been deactivated (which isn't true either).
 Now we're stuck except for having remote powershell access (as system user) with our RMM software.
 I already used it for checking if some safemode has been activated (bcdedit) - which isn't the case.
 We also restarted the machine twice yesterday evening. Startup takes ages, but eventually it comes up to the same state.
 Anyone any idea?
 Cheers

Windows NPS runs 802.1x authentication using the computer certs for auth. None of the aforementioned services share an operating system; each service has their own VM(s).
 So, in the late 2010s when disabling SMBv1 was a priority because of then-recent vulnerabilities, I disabled SMBv1 on all my clients and servers, but apparently not my domain controllers.

 We are a smallish org (45 staff) and I'm preparing to move us to Windows 11 at some point next year, once one of our in house apps is updated from VB4 to .Net and will actually work. We use MDT for reimaging and deployment which happens a handful of times a year. No InTune, we don't do cloud.
 My question is... is there a fix that actually works either via Group Policy or preferable PowerShell as part of the task sequence to remove those damn shortcuts? I'm talking the consumer apps such as TikTok and Spotify.
 FWIW my test rig is on 11 Pro 22H2.
 Also big F**K YOU to Microsoft for including this consumer shit in 11 Pro in the first place!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in IT for a global company and we've been having trouble finding a VoIP solution for our internal Helpdesk team (8 agents) whose members are spread across the globe.
 We're on Google Workspace and we've looked into using Google Voice but while it allows for international outbound calling, it can only assign US and Canada based Google Voice numbers to our agents (ideally, each agent would have a local VoIP-assigned number for each their respective regions--US, Europe, India--that our internal users can call for IT help without having to make international calls.) We also looked in Zoom's 'Zoom Phone' and while it was better, they don't currently support India numbers.
 At this point, we've resigned to the fact there likely won't be one VoIP product to cover ever country we're looking for but we're now thinking maybe a global redirect service might be the way to go--one master toll-free number that will redirect to whoever is on-call.
 Anyone have any suggestions or products to avoid?

 In theory, can ROADMs support 10G, 100G, etc simultaneously since its just manipulating the light? Or are there some real world limitations that require it to operate at a single rate.

 Checkpoint is at the head office and Western Australia is a branch. 
 In Western Australia, the internet is vdsl so it’s being bridged from ISP modem/router to the Watchguard. 
 When we do a site-to-site vpn between the two it works fine but after about 30 min it breaks the connection. I changed the renegotiate from 8 hours to 12 hours it lasted around 3 hours. 
 Does anyone know what’s happening and how to fix this ?

 So I think I've got the backend concept of VXLAN down now at about 95% understanding.
 The Overlay I see as the easier part, VTEP sends a BUM or unicast packet to the other VTEP with the right VNI in, from there, the VTEP that recieves it will look in its database for that VRF/VNI depending on if its a L2 or L3 VNI and then forward onto the correct VRF and end device
 The main confusion left is how different underlay routing combinations work and interact with eachother.
 So far, this is how I see it. And please either feel free to totally correct me or can you please verify if I'm right as well.
 For data plane flood and learn, it's multicast on the underlay, using a combination of OSPF (an IGP) to distribute the RP addresses everywhere, and multicast to send out the packets to the R…]]></summary>

When I say relatively simple, I mean, VMware server connected to core switch, connected to firewall, out to internet, nothing like VRRP or other tech.
 Windows Server IP: 172.16.1.10
 Server default route: 172.16.1.2
 Its Default Gateway: 172.16.1.2 (Core switch)
 Firewall: 172.16.1.1
  
Traceroute to 8.8.8.8
 1 172.16.1.2 (core switch)
 2 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 3 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to 9.9.9.9
 1 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 2 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to mail.google.com
 1 172.16.1.2 (core switch)
 2 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 3 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Traceroute to 8.8.8.8 
 1 172.16.1.1 (firewall)
 2 x.x.x.x (isp router)
  
Why would some trace's hit the core switch (default gateway), and some hit the firewall directly first? Again no other tech is in place... No VRRP, no routing protocol (OSPF, etc), Other than the physical server is connected to the core switch with LACP. 
 The core switch (router) only has one route, and that is its default route of throwing everything at the firewall

 I am facing an unusual issue. We recently acquired a new customer, and unfortunately, their IT personnel have left the company, leaving us with the responsibility of managing their IT infrastructure. Previously, the IT personnel was the main point of contact for everything related to their IT infrastructure.
 Currently, we are facing an issue where the owner of the company has access to only one of the domains' admin credentials, which he can use to manage the account or manage some of the systems. However, there are two different domains, and we cannot access the second domain controller. Additionally, the infrastructure includes a mixture of Linux and Windows machines with various operating systems, but we only have access to about 10% of that infrastructure due to a lack of credentials.
 For Linux machines, I am planning on resetting the root credentials individually.
 Is there any way for us to gain access to the second domain controller? We have access to their VM host, but we are unable to log in to that particular OS. 
 Thank you in advance for your help.

 We have run up a new server 2019 host and are looking to transfer the RD connection Broker, RD Gateway, RD web and RD licensing server roles from the current server 2016 host. After doing some reading, we have found that transferring the RD connection broker role is usually accomplished by configuring a HA cluster, adding the new server to the cluster and then removing the old server. This requires a SQL database and seems like a bit of work. 
 We were wondering if it is possible to install the RD connection broker service on the new server 2019 host, create a new RDP deployment, and then add the existing session host into the new deployment? Would this cause a problem being that the session host is already a part of the old RD collection?
 I have done some reading online and can’t find a straight answer as to whether servers can be a part of multiple RDP collections at the same time or whether they need to be removed from the current collection before being added to the new one. 
 Any help would be appreciated.

 I'm looking for someone to point me in the right direction. I've been searching for a while now and can't find an explanation for what I'm seeing.
 I have two Cisco ASR-9904 routers. One of them is allowing me to implement OSPF configurations. The other one is not.
 See screenshots here.
 I'm not sure why one is allowing OSPF to be configured, but the other isn't. I'm not super experienced with IOS-XR, so sorry if I'm missing something obvious to a lot of you. As far as I know, there is no way to enable or disable features on IOS-XR, like how you can with NX-OS. They are both running the same licenses (no licenses). I did not originally set up the working one, so I'm not sure if anything special was done to get OSPF working. It was set up several years ago. I am however tasked with setting up this second ASR.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning/afternoon/evening !
 I'm trying to figure out a routing issue I'm having with an Adtran / NetVanta router.
 I must have had a big bowl of stupid for breakfast this morning, since I'm still kind of scratching my head as to the source of the problem.
 See attached image for a rough block diagram for the network. . .
 https://i.imgur.com/INbKpWO.jpg
 I have an overload rule set for VLAN3, with a traffic selector of 172.55.0.0 /22 to permit any.
 From the PC, I can ping the VLAN1 IP address on the Adtran, at 172.55.0.222.
 I can also ping a few of the print servers on the 172.55.x.x subnet.
 I can't ping the 172.55.1.1 gateway, or the 172.55.0.200 switch.
 Nor can I reach any of the 172.55.x.x devices via http or telnet, including the ping-able print server devices.
 PCs attached to the switch can of course reach everything on 172.55.x.x, since they are pointed to the 172.55.1.1 gateway for that network.
 I've tried next-hop routes, such as 172.55.0.0 / 22 > 172.55.1.1 but that didn't help. 
 Do I have my overload rule backwards? I have a feeling it's something really basic, and I'm just spacing on the problem completely.
 Any assistance would be appreciated.
 Note: I cannot add any routing rules, or otherwise change the router at 172.55.1.1

 I’ve had three jobs in IT and all of them I grew to dislike after some time. The first two, after about 5 years - my current about one year.. It’s to the point where I’ve shared with a coworker or two that I’m thinking of quitting and looking for another job.
 The problem is, I don’t really want another job in IT right now - it’s been soul sucking. I feel like I burned out years ago, I’ve also been dealing with some personal stuff and the stress of IT and the workplace doesn’t help. The thought of hopping from one 8-5 job to another is just depressing. 
 If in six months, a year or two from now I decide to rejoin the IT workforce, would a gap on my resume hurt me?
 I don’t know what I want to do, I just know that I don’t want to keep doing what I’m currently doing. I do have some concerns about leaving a stable job but I’ve not had an issue being hired in the past and it seems like everyone is hiring nowadays.

 Recently multi-factor authentication was activated remote network side - LAN one wants to connect using AnyConnect to.
 To establish VPN to remote network doesn‘t work in the fashion the window pupping up to conduct 2FA- authentication flashes for just fraction of second then disappears from screen. This way user gets no chance to enter and complete multi-factor authentication.
 Is this a known problem pattern? Where to look for possible root causes?
 Let me know please if more details regarding setup in use are needed.
 UPDATE
 I missed to mention one detail. Whole procedure to establish VPN connection completes with other pop-up: Authentication failed due to problem verifying server certificate. Indeed that prob of server certificate verification I have to live with for months, since long before MFA has been introduced network side. Is this possibly the track I have to follow?
 Client side network config actually as delivered by Linux distribution in use. Please note it is about two independent Linux nodes (well, they share however virtualization host). I can‘t talk about network/authentication config remote network side.
 UPDATE II
 CISCO AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client app installer was downloaded from remote network operator. Last available version in use.
 UPDATE III
 Regarding server certificate verification failure I communicated this to organization IT many months ago. However up to this minute no, or incompetent yet upon heavy delay answers.

I have a generally fairly well tuned antenna for corporate fuckery though and of particular interest, this comparison in their sheet stands out. 
 "Classic Teams: Ability to add third party cloud storage"
 "New Teams: Use the Teams app from your third party cloud provider to collaborate with files in Teams. Note: Teams admins also can turn off native OneDrive and SharePoint file entry points. Learn more at Turn off Teams nave file upload policy"
 What... exactly is changing here? Very simple wording (hey, add third-party cloud storage!) disappearing into something opaque has me wondering if MSFT is set to make it a lot harder to use third-party cloud storage providers. Anyone more hands-on than me care to have an explore and tell me if I am being unreasonable paranoid and technically illiterate?

 The problem is the ISP doesn't allow me to setup my own modem and must use their modem plus they also refused to put the Nokia modem/router in bridge mode. 
 One issue I have been facing is that the Nokia modem hangs every 3-5 days... a simple restart fixes it but not the type of solution I want especially considering that every time it is down I recieved 50 calls!! Isp replaced the modem 3 times but with the same model and after a few months starts hanging.
 What are the possible issues that I may face in this type of setup? What do you guys recommend? 
 Any suggestions apart from taking the ISP tomcourt..

 Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask about this, I want to rearrange and help declutter our network racks for the company I work for.
 Basically the person that set them up is no longer with the company so I have no idea how it was all set up or what the credentials are for the network switches/firewalls. We have a Gigabit fibre leased line. We also have some Dell SonicWalls, TP Link managed switches and a PowerDSine 6548 POE.
 There's ethernet connectivity spread out across about 8 rooms.
 I've only dealt with personal networking, not enterprise, so I feel like I may be a little out of my depth here, just want to see what your thoughts are and what you would do in my position?
 Edit - Thank you so much for everyone's answers, I will follow the main advice you gave which is to not touch it and try to get an IT professional to come. Thanks again 😀

The switch is booting with ROM version 15.30 and I'm loading 15.15 on it which is compatible with the Boot ROM.
 The upload always fails. I get this error
 You have invoked the console download utility. Do you wish to continue? (Y/N)>Download was successful. -- Download for this Product, proceeding -- Compact Flash is not detected. Download is aborted. Ready for code execution. ERROR: Download was unsuccessful. 
 I've tried different CF cards. I've formatted them as FAT from my Windows machine, but I'm not entirely sure the switch understands that. There is a format command in LAN Monitor, but it doesnt seem to do anything or I'm using it wrong. I create a blank directory and then try "format cfa0", "format /cfa0" or "format cfa0/" the directory is still there.
 What am I doing wrong here?

 ​
 If the user sends a print job to our Ricoh MP C3003, then sends another print job before the first one finishes, there is a high change that they receive an error popup and then half the job gets cancelled.
 ​
 I unfortunately do not have the exact wording of the message or where it is coming from. It disappears too quickly for them to get a screenshot. They said it says "Error Printing", followed by the file name and I think it is popping up from the print task tray icon. There is nothing in the event viewer for these that I can find.
 ​
 None of our Windows 10 boxes are experiencing this issue but all of the Windows 11 machines have at least once. Our printers are on a 2016 print server. We've reconfigured a couple to go directly to the printer instead but that didn't seem to help any. I believe it is happening on all of our printers, but the Ricoh is the only one I have log proof of.
 ​
 Googling "Error Printing Windows 11" isn't really giving me anything useful as you could imagine. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

 for my lab I need a cheap SAN solution to create some LUNs and map them to two servers via FC.
 I need these features:
 - RAID Controller supporting RAID5
 - fits SAS HDDs (I have some lying around here)
 - at least 2 FC Ports (2 Gbit should be enough)
 - WebGUI for configuration / creating LUNs etc
 - Price ~500$ without disks
 - At least basic features working without license (I dont need replication, encryption, deduplication etc.)
 Most used/refurbished stuff I found needs some legacy software which has to be licensed. 
 I would be happy for recommendations!
 Thanks

 Has anyone come across something similar that might work with Teams or VoIP systems to make the ringer very loud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are running Microsoft Exchange Version 15.0 build 1497.2 on Windows Server 2012.
 We have an internal mailbox that forwards all emails to a contact on a different domain. So all emails to user@in.com are forwarded to user@out.com. User is a member of a distribution group, group@in.com. So when an email is sent to group@in.com it sends it to user@in.com which then forwards it to user@out.com.
 The error occurs when user@out.com sends an email to group@in.com. It sends correctly to everyone else, but when it tries to forward to user@out.com it sends a 550:
  
user@out.com
 host URL [IP]
 SMTP error from remote mail server after end of data:
 550 permanent failure for one or more recipients (user@out.com:blocked)
  
After testing, it gives the same error when user@out.com directly sends to user@in.com. They receive all emails to group@in.com sent by other users.
 I assume there is some sort of recursive error that flags it as spam because it is trying to forward an email from itself to itself. Other than just having them not use user@out.com to send emails to group@in.com, does anyone have any idea how to fix this?

 Anyone that has migrated the CA off a DC have any tips? Thanks in advance!

We have a user who wants to be able to change their Desktop Wallpaper so we allowed this access and removed the SetWallpaper in the users Startup folder. This worked well and allowed the user to change her wallpaper freely when she wanted to and when she signed out for the day it didn't set the default wallpaper the next time she logged in. However, when the server reboots the Setwallpaper script reappears in her user startup folder. I seen this article below, but it doesn't seem theirs a way to just remove it completely for EC2 instances besides just manually removing it or creating a script to remove it each time.
 ​
 Anyone know a way to stop EC2 Instances from adding the Setwallpaper script to the user folder?

I've checked and the rule for quarantine hasn't been amended recently which was my initial thought. Is there a way I can track what caused it? Going through the MSExchange Management Event Logs, I can see events for when I have re-approved the devices but nothing for the quarantine.
 Looking further into the logs, it appears all the devices are being detected with a different DeviceId.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently racking my brain over the following.
 Since last week or so, our end users have been getting automated emails from microsoft 365, stating emails have been put in quarantaine. These mails are all legit, but we want to stop sending these emails to the end users.
 Ive had a dig through the m365 security section, and changed up the anti phish, spam, and malware policies to use the 'adminonlyaccesspolicy', which does not send emails to the end users, but to no avail apparently. 
 Anyone able to point me in the right direction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an attachment filter rule on my M365 tenant that Quarantines HTML attachments, as the overwhelming majority are phishing messages. There was a previous edge case that allowed attachments with trailing periods to bypass the rule, which with the help of some redditors I solved with a little regex (see this archived thread). My successful rule looks like this in the M365 Exchange Admin:
 Apply this rule if Is received from 'Outside the organization' and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: '\.htm\.$' or '\.html\.$' or '\.inetloc\.$' or '\.htm$' or '\.html$' or '\.inetloc$' 
 But now I'm seeing another edge case where attachments with encoded filenames are also bypassing the rule. I determined that the encoding for .htm and .html are "odG1s?=" and "odG0=?=", so I added them to the rule, but they are still getting through:
 Apply this rule if Is received from 'Outside the organization' and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: '\.htm\.$' or '\.html\.$' or '\.inetloc\.$' or '\.htm$' or '\.html$' or '\.inetloc$' or 'odG1s?=$' or 'odG0=?=$' 
 The email source looks like this:
 ----==_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585 Content-Type: application/html Content-Transfer-Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Disposition: attachment; Filename="=?UTF-8?B?NjUzNC5odG0=?=" <script language="javascript"> document.write(unescape('<redacted>'));</script> ----==_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585-- 
 Any ideas on how to get the existing rule to recognize these types of attachments? Or do I just need to write another one that looks at the Content-Disposition header separately, not depending on Microsoft's interpretation of it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I've been trying to implement Microsoft recommended rules to block TCP445/SMB connections.
 We have VPN set up, to connect to Azure Wirtual Network (our whole domain structure is in Azure).
 So i created a GPO with the following firewall rules:
  
 Block all inbound SMB 445 (made no changes here)
  Block outbound Guest/Public SMB 445 (made no changes here)
  Allow outbound Domain/Private SMB 445 (changed Remote Port to Local Port and Scope Remote to Scope Local and typed in virtual network address range)
  Block outbound Domain/Private SMB 445 (changed Remote Port to Local Port)
 Security connection rules (made no changes here)
  
Gpupdate /force works fine, so i guess its all good? Did i do that correctly?
 ​
 Also thinking about Network security: Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain.
 I've been tracking NTLM\Operational in event viewer, but there are no logs.
 Does that mean i can set the value to one of the Deny ones?
 ​
 Please keep in mind I'm a newbie, thank you.

A user can log a call by sending an email to the Helpdesk address communicated within the company as a result a ticket will be created automatically by the Helpdesk system. Let me say we have Helpdesk1@sysadmin.com for IT, Helpdesk2@sysadmin.com for finance etc. Here’s the problem: Some users will send an email to Helpdesk1, for an IT issue but they’ll cc helpdesk2. This as a result will create 2 tickets on both the IT and finance system. And will also notify finance and IT about the ticket even though it’s not needed. Is there a way to create a rule on Exchange to restrict users to be able to send to one address only at once and not to both at the same time? NB: We always educate our users not to send to both Helpdesk addresses at once since each serves a different purpose..

I’ve mentioned that it would be difficult to stop accidental or intentional downloading of data, if they have viruses on their phones they can infiltrate the company.
 How do I make the policy so tight that no one will want to use a personal phone (I know some still may try without adhering to it but at least that way it’s their fault for not being complaint). If anyone has any examples or templates they can share that would be great.
 The boss in question was hacked previously and still wants to go ahead with this is, and he tends to blame whoever he can even if they have no involvement in an issue. I’ve chosen to stop saying no directly to him because I’ve realised I could have been fired for this after seeing they way he has treated other staff and of course… he is friends with the CEO and CFO.
 And yes resumes have been flying and I may leave soon but just in case I stay I want to have a plan B.

 do any of you have experience with how many thousands of TCP connections we should expect at our central proxy when we roll out M365 (Teams, OneDrive, Sharepoint Online, Exchange Online etc.)? For regulatory reasons, we may not route traffic past the proxy (as Microsoft recommends).
 I realize it's difficult to give an exact number but maybe someone of you has some experiences with concrete numbers (amount users -> amount TCP conncection in average/peak during the day).

I installed the latest update, for Icen version 1.11.3.0, irdman 1.4.3.0 and for Huawei Dorado 6.1.5. I made the configurations based on the Huawei guide. ROCE interface are connected directly to the server. The ports have VLAN 55 for controller A and VLAN 56 for controller B. I created logical ports to which I assigned physical ports. On vSphere I created virtual switches for each VLAN, next created storage adapters with NVME over RDMA. The problem occurs when I try to connect the controller. When I type IP Address, vsphere finds nothing. Has anyone had a similar problem or know what else I can do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there.
 We are in the process of migrating our O365 Licensing from E3->Business Premium to take advantage of the additional security features available.
 We have had E3 for a number of years now, and probably 10% of our users are affected by the reduction of mailbox size from 100GB->50GB. 
 We currently do not have any archive policies in place, but I wonder how other companies deal with archive/large mailboxes after a user has departed the organization.
 Typically, when we offboard a user - we convert the mailbox to shared mailbox, and remove the license. But documentation indicates that shared mailboxes are limited to 50gb. Historically, when we would offboard a user who's mailbox is bigger than 50GB, we would add in an Exchange E2 license to allow access to the mailbox.
 If we DID have an archive policy in place, presumably after we converted the users mailbox to a shared - the archived mailbox would disappear at some point?
 These discussions happening as we determine the best path our our existing LARGE mailboxes (who are licensed with E3) - that we want to get licensed for Business Premium. Initial thought is toss on a Business Premium AND an E2 as a top up to 100GB - BUT the Business Premium licensing DOES allow for very large archiving... But - what happens when that person leaves the org?

 Our organization is planning to procure firewalls to enhance our security posture. We are considering two options:
  
Using a big-size Palo Alto firewall with multiple virtual contexts each for perimeter, data center, internal segmentation, and internet-facing DMZ or
 Implementing multiple layer firewalls from different vendors - one for the perimeter network and DMZ, and another for the data center and internal segmentation.
  
Our goal is to control both data center east-west traffic and south-north traffic from the client to the data center. We want to ensure that our chosen solution provides the best security and flexibility for our organization.
 I would like to hear from the community regarding their experiences and recommendations for firewall solutions. What are the pros and cons of each option, and what are the potential challenges and considerations that we should be aware of before making a decision?
 Thank you in advance for your insights and contributions to this discussion.

However, I don't have any certifications, and I was added to the senior engineering team at this company. It felt like ( and still sometimes does ) I'm underqualified for the position. I was told my hiring manager a big reason I was selected for the role was outstanding soft-skills but I feel like for my current role I'm lacking a bit in more technical areas. Most of my coworkers on my team are senior Network Engineers with 15-20+ years on me, and while I'm learning practically every minute, I feel like I want to pursue a certification of some sort to solidify my skills. I also want something to increase salary potential down the road. Right now, being part of the LAN team, I deal mostly with L2 & L3 switching and I enjoy it. I'm considering studying for the CNNA and eventually CCNP. I also work closely with a CCNP and his knowledge and experience troubleshooting at the packet level is something I'm aspiring too. Given all this, do you think my time and effort be better spent studying for something else?

One of my main responsibilities is being a server admin for a k12 district. We have survived ransomware several years ago and my responsibilities have only grown since then. I know for my own mental health I have to disconnect and leave work at work but it can be difficult sometimes with a looming fear that some hacker out there wants nothing more than to destroy everything that we’ve built. I was just wondering how some of you deal with this type of thing as I know it is common in our field. Be safe out there and take needed time for yourself and your family life. Burnout is real.
 Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice and kind words. It’s tough out there and things can be stressful at times so prepare the best you can to deal with situations when they happen. The best option being to have shared knowledge and responsibilities. Backup what’s important and document everything that would help in the event of a disaster. Don’t shoulder the burden alone. A job is not worth your mental health. Stay safe out there and take care of yourselves.

I had no idea how far out of compliance we were! But to maintain our PCI eligibility, they've been answering all these questions in the affirmative year after year.
 These are not "grey area" questions or things that could be plausibly misunderstood. These are things that we clearly, tangibly do not do or have in place. The costs and turnaround time for putting this all into place would be enormous.
 So now I'm wondering, is this par for the course? Is PCI compliance just a dance where companies nod their head during interrogation and then roll over and take their beating if they ever do happen to get breached? Do the security people signing off on this ever get charged with fraud?
 Not really any of my business, I'm not responsible for filling out this form or evidencing the claims, but holy cow...

 Anyway, he wants me to disable the AV to get some more CPU out (It wasn't even on the top 15 apps in the task manager, but whatever).
 ​
 I play around with the management console, do nothing and promise him it's OK now.
 ​
 5 minutes later his manager calls and asks what I did, b/c his PC suddenly flies!
 ​
 I couldn't lie to the manager, but he's cool and LOL'ed about it hard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 First of all, this is my first time posting here so I don't know if this is the right way to do it.
 I am trying to set up a PC for public use. Specifically, for an interactive art installation. What I am going to present is a "trojan" (not malicious) written in .VBS that takes control of the system and displays visual content as if it were a movie. The thing is that since I want to maintain the interactivity, being a public space, I need to isolate somehow the system and restrict unwanted activity (avoiding having to go to repair it continuously).
 I had thought about Microsoft's Kiosk mode, but I have Windows Home and I can't use it. With this, I thought of virtualizing a machine, but if the software crashes I don't know how I could automate the execution. Finally, I thought of using an isolated user and through UAC limit its range of action, but I don't know.
 What do you think? I can't find the solution.
 Thanks!

 Does OS rewrite the whole disk or there is a good part outside OS and boot partitions?

 I'm trying to buy a pure sine wave UPS for my computer that has a 850W aPFC PSU. I use the computer as both a home server, dev environment, and gaming a few hours a month. It's a 16-core 7950X with a 3070 RTX.
 I only use about 250-300W during usual non-intense loads, and do not need an 850W UPS, so not sure whether I need to overspend here and get 900W UPS, or if a good quality 500-600W line interactive Eaton with pure sine would be enough.
 I don't want to get in a situation where the computer would power off when the power is out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a little background about me. A couple of years ago I graduated with an MIS degree (jack of all trades, not specialized in any), and got a helpdesk position for 1.5 years as of now with zero experience in IT cause I had no idea what I wanted to do. The hiring person (who is my lead) in the company gave me the opportunity even when I had zero experience whatsoever. I had the opportunity to learn how to do some basic helpdesk stuff like troubleshooting, push software via SCCM, image/reimage laptops, intune, exchange admin center, active directory, etc.
 A month ago, the infrastructure manager saw me at the front desk and came up to me and we kind of sparked a conversation about what I wanted to do, work goals, etc. I told him I wanted to work on cloud stuff, especially AWS, and how I loved the company. He came back a couple of weeks to the front desk and told me to apply for a sys admin position for his team in the same company that just got posted. So, I did and here I am now for an interview opportunity for this position. 
 I guess what I'm trying to figure out is how to do I go about this interview, this is something I want to do and I'm very anxious and nervous about how to approach this interview because I have limited interview experience:
 Here are some of the tasks, the role will be doing:
 • Performing daily operations and maintenance of the Enterprise Server infrastructure. This infrastructure includes VMWare, Windows Servers, Active Directory, File and Print Management, System Center Configuration Manager, SharePoint, SQL, Nagios, Rubrik, and Ansible. 
 • Working with engineers across the enterprise to ensure that the Company's servers and workstations are patched and upgraded in a timely manner. 
 • Helps develop solutions, design, and system architecture. 
 • SCCM Administration • Dell/EMC – VXRails maintenance and upgrades 
 • VMWare Workspace One and Horizons Administration 
 • Active Directory Administration 
 • Azure and AWS

 So starting from a clean slate, would you use WSL(2) or a full HyperV VM as your 'home' to interface with a linux server fleet? 
 WSL would be easiest, but a VM would be most comprehensive. I'd like to hear you opinions.

 It took me almost 2 months since my first post about DEVCOR to commit but now I'm all in. DEVCOR is an expensive exam, $480 (incl. taxes) is not really cheap, so I've spent extra $90 on the official assessment exam in order to get understanding of what topics and level of detail to expect, learn the format of the exam and to know what topics I need to revise. It has 80 % passing score, I scored 59 % on the first try with no study and 82 % on the second after revising for a day. I am much more relaxed now that I have a better picture of what the exam is like.
 With 3 days left I plan to skim through the official study guide, focusing on topics I failed in the practice exam. If you have anything to point out or recommend to focus on I'll appreciate your ideas.

 I'm a sysadmin at a few schools, and I'm trying to deploy a GPO to restrict EXE games which the students appear to be running from their desktops. I essentially followed this guide:
 https://blogs.manageengine.com/corporate/general/2018/10/25/application-whitelisting-using-software-restriction-policies.html
 I've got a test OU with a Software Restriction Policy deploying. I've got my computer in there and also a user. I've tested SRP under User and also Computer and can confirm the GPO is reaching the machine.
 However, weirdly it seems as if none of the path rules are doing anything? I've explicitly blocked several paths and extensions (EXE's, MSI's, BAT's, etc) and as the user, I can run BAT's and EXE's with no worries whatsoever. The student account I am testing with is not a local administrator either. 
 I've been troubleshooting this all week and am completely lost now. There are no SRP logs in Event Viewer either, so I can't even see why it isn't working. 
 Any advice for me here is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
 EDIT - Might have my answer already. I’m running 22H2 and SRP is deprecated in favour of AppLocker. Thanks everyone!

 We have many network cabinets dotted around the site with 700VA UPS for power backup, usually after 8 months they go bad. Sometimes we simply have a company come in to replace the batteries and work goes on, or we buy new ones. I have calculated and seen that it's cheaper by $20 per UPS to replace the batteries
 However on the technical side of things is this a good practice

 In the past you would buy VPLS if you were, let's say, a hosting company with more sites and needed to migrate the VM's from one site to the other without changing the IP address.
 But now, if you are the same hosting company, you can just run OSPF from the CE to the PE and advertise Loopback of all VTEP's and deploy EVPN VXLAN on your switches.
 So my question is maybe especially for SP guys: who's buying L2VPN?

What does Dell have to lose by making the files public? Could anybody with a corporate account send me a few things? I'd really appreciate the latest firmware and tools relevant for managing and using with vSphere.
 Also, can I jump to the latest version if they need to be updated, or would I have to update one version at a time? Any experiences or advice about this particular model would also be much appreciated.

 I've heard of companies wanting one or two, maybe three managerial references. Something which I'm not comfortable with because, well, my coworkers know me better. And quite frankly many of my former supervisors were less than on-the-level in one way or another. Listing every single one, though? Mmm no.
 Additional information:
 I should clarify the story a wee bit. The company in question is setting up a bid proposal for a contract with a government entity. The government entity already has something in place regarding work history and general trustworthiness--if they had any questions they could look someone up. The information is available, they just have to reach out to X org.

I'm trying to find an explanation for why when an optical gig port on an NE40 is configured with autoneg disabled, the interface still passes traffic without error, but causes the connected ADVA interface to show as down, while it is also passing all the traffic it is supposed to. 
 Basically some of our team are troubleshooting TLOS faults, where auto neg is disabled, setting neg to auto, then closing the job, when in reality, the neg settings have no bearing on the functionality of the circuit and the TLOS is being caused by something else, which is missed because of the assumption that auto neg being disabled was causing the fault. Any technical explanation for this phenomena would may help where my logic and real world examples have failed to convince colleagues.

 But when I try to use an SVI and a L2 port instead I can't get it to work. I've got a vlan interface with an IP address in the pool, then I put the L2 port in that vlan, but clients can't get IPs. Is there some other piece that I'm missing? Or is it even possible to configure a DHCP server this way?

 Now I feel that there has been a blurred line between help desk issues and true Sysadmin. This sub is mainly filled with people complaining about users or their shitty job and not about any complex or difficult issue they are trying to solve. 
 I think there should be a mandatory flair for user related issues or job so we can just mentally filter those posts out. Or these people should just move over to r/helpdesk since most are not sysadmins to begin with. 
 Tho I feel for some that are a one man shop help desk/ admin. Which is why a flair revamp might be better direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I am looking at updating our password policy for my org and I know a lot of focus is on length over complexity nowadays, and I was trying to put together some helpful tips for users on choosing passphrases instead of passwords and I wanted to give them a resource to play with so they could see the difference and I saw some of these password strength meters mentioned, but they seem to throw vastly different results which I think as an end user would confuse me if I was really choosing a secure password.
 For example, a phrase like "Ihaveareallybighouse!" is 21 characters with upper, lower, and special characters and https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/ says it would take "1 hundred quintillion years" to crack whereas passwordmonster.com says it would take 3 days lol.
 I'm just wondering do you have any tools you trust to give to end users to help them make sure they are choosing good passwords?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To those of you who must support legacy applications whose servers cannot be re-IP’d - in an active/passive production DC/DR DC type setup, I’m curious how you’ve setup your core routing to advertise your production subnets in an actual DR scenario, while in a passive/DR testing scenario - keeping the DR’d replica subnets local to the DR site.
 For example, my production DC subnets are say: 10.0.0.0/22 carved out into 4 subnets with SVIs: 10.0.0.1/24, 10.0.1.1/24, 10.0.2.1/24, 10.0.3.1/24 on the core.
 In my DR site I have some active subnets/SVIs for management/jump box that are always advertised: 10.1.0.1/24, 10.1.1.1/24 on the core.
 I do not stretch layer-2 between my prod and DR sites. In a DR scenario, in my DR site I can bring up and advertise matching subnets/SVIs matching those from my production site - who theoretically just got blown up and is unreachable. I can bring up my VMs and infrastructure through replication. My MPLS provider speaks EIGRP with me so I can reannounce that 10.0.0.0/22 now lives in DR. This is all fine and tested.
 My issue is that in a test scenario where I want to bring up VMs and test them on their original subnets - I’m curious how you folks would handle this. Would you advertise with a lower metric and risk a split brain routing scenario (scary)? Would you suppress advertisements until you’re ready to be in a DR scenario (seems safer)?
 I can comfortably automate these types of changes via Cisco scripting/my choice of automation front end. I just want to be able to test these VMs from a sandbox in DR that you can get to via a jump box.
 Open to all ideas and possibilities! Just curious what others have done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm testing two DELL S5048F with VLT and peer routing. I have a doubt regarding the primary node failure.
 This is the configuration: sw-core1 is the primary node, sw-core2 is the backup node. Peer routing is enabled on both nodes.
 Both switches contains VLAN 40 and VLAN 50 with an ip address assigned. sw-core1 is the default gateway for the devices inside VLAN 40 and VLAN 50.
 These are the tests performed:
 When both switches are powered on devices on VLAN 40 can ping the devices on VLAN 50 as expected.
 When one switch are powered off (failure scenario) PC on VLAN 40 can ping the PC on VLAN 50 as expected.
 If during a failure scenarion of the primary node (sw-core1 powered down) I restart the backup node (sw-core2) after the boot I cannot ping any device indefinitely. Only powering on the sw-core1 restore the comunication.
 Is this a correct behavior or I'm missing something in the configuration? It could be a normal behavior because at the startup sw-core2 has only the ip assigned locally and cannot synchronize with sw-core1. So, the backup node cannot know the IPs assigned to the sw-core1 interfaces.
 Thank you. Regards.

 We want (must) allow users to use Teams on their private computers at home, because not all have work devices and teams via citrix is just not useable at all, but they should not be allows any other cloud app such as Exchange Online, Sharepoint, or so.
 So i created 2 policies:
 1: "External Device Access": This policy applies if the device is not on a trusted network, applying to All Cloud apps - excluding "Microsoft Teams", as grant access it requires a compliant domain joined device with multi factor every x hours.
 2: "Allow Teams everywhere": This policy applies if the device is not on a truste network, but only to the Cloud app "Microsoft Teams", as grant access it only requires multi factor every x hours.
 So far so good, Exchange Online, Sharepoint does not work on non domain joined devices now, but so does Teams. The second CA policy never gets triggered for some reason and i dont know why.
 Has anyone of you something similar done already?

 DL-Customer Test
 Customer Test
 ........
 What I mean is like in our company there is not a lot of organization for example we have distribution lists with "dots","hyphen", etc ex:([customer.Test-delivery@](mailto:costumer.Test-delivery@)....)
 what I mean I guess It could be more organize with a structure
 Ex: [Costumer-test-Delivery@](mailto:Costumer-test-Delivery@)... or DL-CostumerTestDelivery
 This way I was asking if you guys have a structure when creating a Distribution List?

 Management has been nice to be when Ive crossed paths and said how much they appreciate all the effort. Made sure we have been fed all week working around the clock at least. 
 I think the BOD is giving my managers a much different front though. 
 I'm an engineer and have been onsite/online for 14+ average since it started 9 days ago. Today my manager told another engineer that the bod expectation is we are here around the clock until it gets fixed and was pretty pushy about it. 
 Has anyone experience an IT purge shortly after an incident? Would it just be management? Or have you seen whole departments be evicted and outsourced? 
 I'm just trying to think through the odds I don't have a job in a month and if this place is worth putting in the hours for now...
 To clarify, I'm also an engineer, which I hope would help protect my job a bit more.

 Edit: Folks, I agree users should have basic computer skills, but it’s been my experience at least that the people who do the hiring and firing don’t care about that as much as we do… So unless someone is doing something dangerous or egregious, this is also an unfortunate part of the job we have to accept.

 But in a recent test I saw that when the bridge I'd was changed, the traffic although on directly connected links didn't go anywhere. After disabling STP the bridge ID upstream reverted to the expected value and then traffic worked fine.

 The Equipment We Have:
 Three servers, all of them are desktop in form factor, an 8 camera PoE NVR with none of its cabling coming from our main switch, a 24 port Trendnet TEG-S24g, and three 48 port category 5 patch panels. Sitting on top of everything in the server rack is an itty bitty Arris Surfboard modem hooked up to a consumer Asus router from a few years ago.

 For other programs, i have created PowerShell scripts that help desk technicians use to pick and choose which programs to install based on the user's job title.
 To create these golden images, we use Hyper-V to create a checkpoint, then Sysprep and boot to WinPE. We then use DISM capture-image commands to capture the WIM file.
 However, I was wondering if there is a more efficient way to automate the image capture process

 There seems to be so many applications for NLOS service, really hard to believe it's completely unavailable... unless we want to pay $250+ a piece for 10-20 year old used equipment on ebay.

 So as the title says, I have a former employee that has 2FA for the Google Workspace account set to their personal number and now that we are off-boarding them we have an issue. I need to Migrate their account to an Archive we set up which requires an app password to do. Unfortunately, I cannot create that app password without verifying 2FA to the employee's number. Has anyone been able to change the phone number for a users 2FA? We have 2FA set up for the whole org so turning it off just for this person isn't really the move. I have some ideas for general workaround but Im curious if anyone has experience with this. Thank you all for your input!

 EDIT:
 Thank you u/thunder923111 for the suggestion! This worked and I was able to move forward.

 We now have this policy in place that, when you're let go, you start a "countdown" till your last day. Some layoffs have been 30 days, some have been 60 days, some have been two weeks. But while you're "counting down," you can take all the paid time off you want to look for a job. Some managers let you go home with your laptop and just WFH till your last day.
 Now, as generous as this sounds, they do this for a singular reason. If you find another job during your countdown, you're not eligible for the severance package.
 Well, we had one guy that had been there FOREVER and got laid off. He was eligible for well over 6 months' salary in severance. Out of respect for his long history with the company, his manager let him WFH during his whole 30 day countdown...
 28 days into his countdown, someone from my company goes to another company to have lunch with a friend. And he sees his old coworker working there at a desk, with our company laptop with the asset tag clearly visible on the open lid. When the guy walks away from his desk, sure enough, it's our laptop. The guy is VPNed in, and logged into Outlook and MS Lync (This should tell you how long ago this happened).
 The guy comes back from lunch and tells his coworkers about how the guy they lost on the team landed at a new company where this guy they know works. Sadly, the manager overheard them talking. He called HR. And the guy lost his severance package.
 So damn close...

 EDIT 2: Mostly need to check which devices are always online (most likely servers), which come and go (most likely teachers), and which static IPs never go active (So I can reassign them as I need)
 Hey guys, new here, first of all I'm from Chile so my English might not be perfect. I'm at a new job on this university, where they already have a complex network as I've seen, but they never kept track of it internally (I mean on my department) besides having an old Excel which isn't even up to date (Lots of devices that doesn't exist anymore and new ones that weren't registered).
 I'm trying to monitor this network, for which I already tried Solarwinds (which have 50 sensors in its free version) and Nagios (which seems unpractical since I have to manually categorize every device and I can't confirm every single one of them). Is there any solution that allows me to just make an in real time scan on an IP range constantly just to ping active hosts? Preferably It'd be nice to keep track of the last time in which devices were active. I can run a server.
 Thanks in advance and sorry for my English.

 I am a system admin for various companies. I essentially consult but in a way i am onsite with the company handling all their docs, internal items, and other for smaller companies which is why i can administrate so many at once. I have one company i've been with for 10+ years but they got bought out and now have an MSP, that literally just keeps making mistake after mistake. They are never onsite, they move around reservations DHCP and change scopes due to lack of knowing the firewall, and generally cause the site a lot of issues. Which is great for me right, i make a ton of money off their mistakes. Sorry but that isn't my game. I like good business and administration, not causing a hedge fire and saying o well #xyz is just another client. Recently i did a large overhaul and installation of new networks, vlans, wifi, ect... Today i get a call they made more changes and now changed the firewall password essentially forcing everything through them which for me means extra hours billing to wait on a tech. Is it time to just let the clients turn into an inferno and go about my day or should i be grateful my income is probably going to double from them and just shut up and color?
 It just really freakin urks me how bad they are for such a large company taking care of a small hotel which is literally nothing to manage. How do you guys deal with bad MSP's that the company is married into?

The role of this Ring Descriptor is to tell the NIC where in some pre-allocated memory pool are there free objects for the NIC to DMA it's receiving packets. There seems to be a Receive Ring Descriptor and Transmit Ring Descriptor.
 Questions:
 (1) Are these Ring Descriptors stored in memory or on the NIC?
 (2) I've occasionally read about receive queues, are these different from Receive Ring Descriptors? If so where are these stored, on the NIC or memory? ... I've specifically read that the packets first get written to the Receive queues and then from there to pre-allocated memory pool, however can't find anything conclusive on this.

 Ive been advised of an employee who’s contract ends in a week, and has not been renewed. The employee knows this, and is fairly pissed off about it, Ive been told.
 We are a M365 shop, with Intune, and Sophos Firewalls with filtering, Backups in the cloud etc.
 While I have no reason to be concerned, since the user doesnt have any type of admin credentials or can do anything (and complains about it constantly), I was wondering what else I can do to restrict the user in case of any acting out. 
 My current plan is to nuke his laptop from orbit (wipe) once I get it, and his office accounts will just get moved to shared mailboxes, etc. All his access will get cut off at the time of his last minute etc. 
 Of course, he may just decide to push his laptop off the edge of desk, which isn’t my problem either. 
 Ive never really thought about what else is out there, so I thought I would throw it out here just to see what others say. Im sure there are some stories that have a lesson out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A have large site network that, once upon a time, needed 21 MST instances. Over the years, the topology was consolidated so that one of two core switches became the root bridge for every VLAN at the site. The appropriate number of MST instances for us to have today is two.
 We knock down and stand up subnets all the time, and every time we do, we have to pick an unused VLAN tag that is already mapped to one of the 21 MST instances—which is fine, but the instances have no bearing to what we actually do. When an engineer asks, "Which instance should I pull this tag from?" the answer is, "Whichever you want." Consequently, things are so mixed up that we'd have to not only create a new MST region, but basically start over with our VLAN tag/subnet associations to get them into the correct one of the two new instances.
 I'm not clinically OCD, but I hate inefficiency and inconsistency. Hate. It. If this were a small business, I'd be willing to substantially inconvenience my life to clean this up during maintenance windows. But this is a site that has hundreds of VLANs, 600 users, a datacenter with 80 server racks, and a significant internet presence. When a city has poor road design, we all live with it because it's impossible to fix without knocking the city down. I'm thinking this might be one of those situations. I've never tried to fix an MST region before, but I know it can't be done without downtime. And literally the only people who even know about this inconvenience are the network team. Cleaning it up will not noticeably improve network function.
 Do you agree that we should just deal with it forever? What kinds of unfixable legacy spaghetti configs exist on your network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 My video production house is upgrading it’s infrastructure for remote work. One of our needs is a rack of Mac Studios for remote work. However, we want two stations in our office to be available for remote people to use when needed. In an ideal world, those two stations could be connected to any of the Mac Studios at any time. The Macs would live in our data closet, and the stations would be about 30 feet away near a fiber-connected switch (if that makes a difference).
 My first thought was a KVM, but I’ve heard that these are not the most reliable in terms of latency. Each station would have two monitors, mouse, keyboard, and headphones.
 Does anyone know if this is viable with hardware? My backup solution would be to use Jump desktop to remote into the stations via LAN, which I think would work just as well.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a 'glue' to unload routes from a database into kernel routing tables.
 I marked routes from my 'glue' code with a custom 'proto' (42 is babel, 2 is static, 186 is bgp). I use a different number '111' for my routes. This really helps me to know if I should add/delete a route or not.
 Now I want to import routes from kernel into Bird, but I can't find a way to specify 'proto'. (My search is complicated by the fact that Bird is using word 'protocol' to name own pieces of config).
 Is there a way to say Bird to export routes with a specific proto num?
 The current import stanza in my bird looks like this:
 ``` table kern_91;

At present, we use a Public Folder mailbox to manage project team emails, and the mailbox database has grown to 125GB in size. It would be much larger than that if we weren't using Metalogix Archive Manager to archive many of those Public Folder emails.
 The Public Folder database in Exchange Online is 100GB and Shared Mailbox is 100GB, which is insufficient for our needs. I'm exploring alternative solutions for sharing emails among project team members. I'm hoping my situation is not uncommon.
 Below is an image of how we've structured the public folder mailbox for email sharing:

 So we are refreshing 8-10 computers in our network with windows 11. After going through all of the headache to actually get the image captured we are now trying to deploy them with pxe through fog.
 Normally this process for win10 machines takes about 10-15 minutes and done. For some reason windows 11 takes HOURS and the counter keeps going up. Eventually reaching a point where it's not feasible to let it continue.
 We are a small school corporation with TONS of network bandwidth so it is not bottle necking there. The image is just basic 11 with our office keys and a couple things of basic software so it's not a massive image.
 I am at a complete and total loss... any help/guidance would be appreciated
 ​
 edit: The machine I am pushing the image to is a Lenovo M70Q Gen 3 if that helps

 We are planning to harden our internal cryptography and after doing my due diligence I came with following settings (they will be applied via GPO, slowly, one by one to servers and endpoints) as something what makes sense now. 
 SSL 2.0 - Disabled
 SSL 3.0 - Disabled
 TLS 1.0 - Disabled
 TLS 1.1 - Disabled
 TLS 1.2 - Enabled
 TLS 1.3 – System default
 Ciphers in order:
 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
 What worries me, is quite short list of ciphers which were left after eliminating everything what is considered as a weak.
 I realize that some strange legacy systems will be a problem but I’m looking for advise from somebody who recently harden windows cryptography in their environment, what problems can potentially occur with standard systems, e.g. Windows server and desktop, SQL, IIS, AD, file shares and so on.

 The standard Kensington laptop lock slot is 3x7mm, and the newer Kensington NanoSave slot is 2.5x6mm.
 The modification would basically entail grinding/filing off a little metal from the "fingers" of the lock, which grip inside of the locking slot.
 Can anyone see how this mod might compromise the security of the lock vs. buying a NanoSaver lock which already comes with a smaller set of locking fingers? 
 Even out of the box, these types of locks aren't able to prevent a determined attacker anyways (cutting/decoding/picking/impressioning), so perhaps the only point is just to save $$$.
 What do y'all think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have Office 365 which means we have an Azure AD and Azure AD Connect syncs the on-prem AD with Azure AD.
 We have a hosted app that can use LDAPS authentication but I can't work out if I can enable LDAPS on the Azure AD included with 365 without specifically paying for Azure Active Directory Domain Services.
 https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/
 This guide reads to me like it's not included with 365 and we'd need to add a paid Azure subscription on the tenant?

 Does anyone know please?

 In case this helps someone out:
 We jumped from E3 to E5 for 400+ users yesterday. Our licenses are applied via AAD Groups where we have license features turned on/off as required. Our CSP/NCE handled the process and opted to upgrade our existing licenses. When the process completed all staff were on E5 with ALL E5 features turned on including Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing.
 Evidently, Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing once enabled does the following:
  
Sends an email to all staff with their personal Audio Conferencing pin information (most of my staff thought this was a phishing email).
 Updates all future and recurring Teams Calendar meeting entries with the new Dial-in features. This uses the Meeting Migration Service (MMS) - Link
 Sends a meeting invite update to all attendees for each updated meeting
 If the recipient has their OoO on, an auto response is of course sent back to the organiser
  
The above has caused mass confusion for our staff and in some instances, users have 60+ meeting invites and auto response/OoO messages all at exactly the same time.
 It's on us for not looking into this more but evidently its caught other people out as well. Link
 Looks like their is a cmd to disable the MMS for changes related to audio conferencing only.
 Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -AutomaticallyMigrateUserMeetings $false 
 Just wish we had known this before.
 Have a nice Friday.........

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've bought a used NETGEAR ProSafe FVS318G. I want to upgrade the firmware to the latest version, because the one that it has is very old and seems to be buggy sometimes. So I downloaded the image file, navigated to Administration -> Settings Backup & Upgrade, selected the file and hit upload. The progress bar showed up for around 3 seconds and then the page disappeared and a "Connection was reset" error occurred. I tried using different browsers. Then I connected to the device via telnet, and tried to use the admin/upgradeFirm/upgrade command, but no luck here either. I am not sure if I used the command correctly though, because I couldn't find any useful information about it. I tried giving it an IP of a TFTP server and HTTP server, nothing worked, just a "error: Error in Firmware upgrade" message. Invoking "cliErrno get" returned -1, and I don't know what it means. Does anyone have experience with that kind of stuff. Is there any way I can update the firmware or am I stuck with this version? What could cause this, is the router physically damaged? If yes, can I repair it somehow?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I work as a tier 2 technician for an MSP and was wondering what other people's experience is with being in an on-call rotation is like, this is my first actual position working directly in IT and based on feedback I have gotten from other people I know in the field I've been told that my on-call rotation unrealistic especially for the return. 
 I work in a team of 4 technicians and 3 of us participate in on-call which consists of being the only user working on after-hours tickets, 5PM-9PM Monday-Friday and 9AM-9PM weekends. We are expected to review any tickets that come in and work on them if they are deemed by either the customer or us important enough to service outside of normal hours, permitting their company has a proper contract for after hours support or they get approval from someone willing to pay the premium. This on-call included driving out to customer locations if the issue is of a truly critical nature. 
 The on-call rotation is a full week from 5PM Friday until the following Friday, and then 2 weeks no on-call for the other 2 on-call technicians, thus a 3-week cycle. The compensation for this on-call is 80 hours of vacation time that is awarded immediately on your start date with no rollover. 
 IF they hire additional Tier 2+ technicians then the rotation would be divided among all applicable techs but it's already been six months and it doesn't seem like they will be getting more people. 
 So yeah let me know what your on-call experiences are like and what you think of mine. Thank you.
 Note: Also for added context the company I work for has terrible procedure, leadership, and communication skills, and almost no one to fall back on if you have trouble resolving an issue.

But as I see it, we're going to be stuck in a dual-stack world until everyone is forced to only use IPv6 on the public internet.
 So, what scenario do you think it more likely?
  
The Big ISP's get together and announce they will no longer route IPv4 by "X" date.
 
We keep running IPv4 forever and deploy widespread CG-NAT as a bandaid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks. I work for a small WISP, where we have a VPN to access our stuff out in the field. We have a VPN which for the most part works as expected, that is, until you try it on metro by T-Mobile. At&t and Verizon are fine, but TMobile is having some glitches
 First of all, my TMobile phone has VPN access over wifi, and even when it's roaming on at&t, the VPN works. I mean, I can barely do general web browsing when it roams to at&t, but accessing network resources actually works great. 
 "Well when you say it doesn't work, what do you actually mean by that?"
 Well, I can turn it on and get an IP Address. I can go into visit whoismyisp.com and it will tell me the name of the ISP I work for (and not TMobile ), and web browsing is as good as without a VPN. I can ping the private addresses of stuff on our network. But when I try to log into the GUI of any equipment, it just times out. 
 That seems odd to me that I don't know how that can even work, provided I can definitely get onto the VPN. 
 I am quite confident that reaching out to TMobile will be fruitless in getting the VPN to work properly. Any ideas what I could try here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My peers and I are designing a new network for a school district, let's say... Fake School District. We've hit a good point in our switching and would like to move on to our wireless. In my mind, I would like the SSID's setup like this:
 FSD - Main network; RADIUS for AD authentication FSD_Unsecured - No PSK; MAC ACL; exists only for devices that don't support 802.1X FSD_Setup - No PSK; Access only to the site for agreeing to terms & conditions and downloading the cert for the main network
 I have a few questions about the configuration I proposed here:
 1. Can I use the same NPS I use for the main network for the MAC ACL on the unsecured network? 2. If I register a MAC for the unsecured wireless network, can I dynamically assign a VLAN similar to security groups with my main network? 3. Will I need a web server for the FSD_Setup network or will my WLC (UniFi) do the trick? 
 Basically, I'd like these scenarios to be true:
 Scenario #1: A student brings their own device. They connect to FSD_Setup, click AGREE on the site and it redirects them to a site that downloads the certificate and shows screenshots and instructions for importing it. After importing it, they connect to the FSD network, type in their AD username and password, then, boom! They are now on the Student-Wireless VLAN and can do their assignments.
 Scenario #2: A teacher needs a Chromecast setup to cast to their TV. I take the physical address written on the back, log in to my server and register the device. On the setup wizard for the Chromecast, I join FSD_Unsecured and am now on the TV VLAN.
 Thank you!

 What MS seems to have done in these app execution aliases is set up a seperate listener (with sufficient permissions) that checks if the dummy executables was launched via a command pointing to an executable in the folder of a User Environment Variable, and if the execution alias is enabled.

 This discussion has been going on for years but now the heat has been turned up. How can I convince this guy that an already underpaid department can't take all of that on without hiring a couple of people, which which would cost more than the MSP?
 Make it make sense, because my head is going to explode. For the record, I'm paid much less than the MSP.

Would any standard QSFP56 cable work? All the vendors I've talked to don't seem to know.
 As of right now, it would be a direct connection between the two, but we're hoping to get a 200Gbe or 400Gbe switch by the end of the year.

 Anyways. I've learned that there will be layoffs next month and I want to be included on it so I can bow out gracefully with a severance package (18 weeks + benefits). Has anyone successfully navigated on being ASKED to be included on the layoffs? 
 I mean, I have a another job lined up starting in the next month. I was going to do both to help pay off some debt but that big severance package would do the trick. Thoughts?

 ⁠For the option to be enabled I need to have at least one network set with the ubiquiti switch pro as a router. normal?
  ⁠When trying to give it IP fix address in the 192.168.100.x range, it says can only be given one in the 192.168.1.x range. Why? Gateway is on 192.168.100.1 and switch just x.100.2. Need to keep the switch on that one for all network is setup for it to be on that IP. And understand both the ubiquiti console and unifi switch need to be on the same subnet (192.168.100.x in this case). Thanks for any suggestions... ;)

 Oh man... remote user can't connect to the vpn! That is bad... Oh hey can they ping the gateway @ whatever.fuckthegatewayaddressis.com? Oh man!! Look right there in the client logs it says can't resolve the following address...
 Oh yeah look at that error code it just spat out... Maybe we should look to see if that tells us more than "Doesn't work."

 Verify VPC is complete and in sync
 Build the configurations for each IDF, switch ports, trunks, etc.

 For 100GbE 100 meter, this is my (~$340): https://www.fs.com/products/136833.html?attribute=32524&id=597389 There are some Dell 100GbE 100 meter available (~$1000): https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-networking-transceiver-qsfp28-100gbe-swdm4-duplex-lc-om3-om4-mmf/apd/407-bbvn/networking There are also some 40GbE 300 meter rated (~$300): https://www.fs.com/products/137125.html?attribute=32588&id=597711
 So my questions is. If these exist and work (they do work we tested). Why in the world are people running MPO cable between floors when two strands of LC can net you a 200gjg LAG?
 EDIT: I guess my bigger question is that I read about different types of MPO cabling and how some have more strands than the other. Like I think there is a 100gig MPO cable and a 40gig MPO cable. So I’m just really confused on how we are getting 100gig over a single LC connection.
 And I want to make sure LC over 100gig or 40gig is a supported and qualified technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 ​
 I've been struggling to come up with a solution to a problem I'm trying to solve.
 ​
 We have 2 locations, Data Center & HQ. We have APs at both broadcasting the same SSIDs. At the DC, we have a Meraki MX64 concentrator, and at both locations we have Edge FortiGate Firewalls as an Active-Passive HA Pair.
 ​
 What we'd like to do is, for one of our SSIDs (let's call it SSID1), broadcast it at both locations, give it its own DHCP Address Pool, send it to the MX64 concentrator, & out to the Internet through the FortiGate. To accomplish this, I've created an Interface on the FortiGate, & set it as a DHCP Server with the Subnet I want. I've connected the Meraki MX64 concentrator's Internet Port to the FortiGate via our Core Switching Network, the Uplink IP is in the same Subnet & the Gateway is the new interface I created on the Firewall.
 ​
 I've been trying this, but I've been hitting many roadblocks.
 ​
 I've created a test SSID at the Data Center & when I implement, the folks there can't see the SSID in their Wi-Fi list & can't connect to it if they try manually.
 ​
 I'd love to hear any ideas from those with bigger and brighter minds than mine!

 Or are there other things that can happen to reset those timers?

 Not sure this one entirely for just Sys Admins. I wanted to know how my fellow Sys Admins feel about education to advance your career? Would you choose the Certification(s) path or pursue a Degree? Both?
 I've been a Sys Admin for a number of years and decided to pursue my Degree in Cybersecurity. I'm in my 2nd year now. Lately I've been debating whether all the money I'm putting towards a Degree is worth it or not. My long term plan is to finish my Associates program and follow that will several certifications. Undecided whether I'll go on to pursue my BA, mostly because of the money but my age has a lot to do with it as well. I'll be turning 51 this year and don't want to accumulate unnecessary debt unless I have confidence that there's some type of ROI. Certs are cheaper for sure. 
 How do you all feel about this classic IT Professional debate?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We are facing an a scalability limitation on our ACI fabric due to our implementation and I am curious if someone has seen a fabric above the Cisco advised "limit".
 Here is a short story, what we have, and we are facing. We are running ACI version 4.2, which is acting as the transit for an NSX-T platform. Due to the implementation of the NSX solution, all of the ESXi hosts are both compute and edge nodes. So, the Edge VMs can shuffle around on the whole ESXi cluster. What this causes in 4.2 ACI, that we need to configure connected ESXi hosts * 2 BGP connectivity profile on each leaf of ours.
 Now this can be fixed with floating L3out on ACI version 5.2, but currently we are in the middle of APIC upgrade and then Fabric upgrade is next. (Corporate politics postponed this longer than should have).
 We realized as a new customer is coming, that we are getting to the advised limit by Cisco on 4.2 ACI.Verified Scalability Guide for Cisco APIC, Release 4.2(2), Multi-Site, Release 2.2(2), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches, Release 14.2(2) - CiscoNumber of BGP/OSPF/EIGRP session per L3 fabric are 3000.
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/5x/verified-scalability/cisco-aci-verified-scalability-guide-521.html
 5.2 Jumps to 10000.
 We asked Cisco and the answer was kind enough to say "Yeah, the huge jump to 10000 is because, we tested with 10000, and we just tested 5.2 more than 4.2".
 This doesn't necessarily gives us the answer we were hoping for. Basically, we would like to know if someone faced this amount of configured BGP connections and went beyond the "limit". We would like to know if any stability in the fabric occurred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Lately I have been struggling to choose the right layer 2 vendor (Cisco, Meraki, Ubiquiti Unifi, etc.) for SMB customers who own many switches (let's say 20-30) and want central management for those devices so that you don't have to SSH/Telnet to each every time you want to add a VLAN o change a port.
 I really line the simple pane of glass that Fortinet or Sophos gives you to manage Firewall/Router+Switching+APs but usually HW is too expensive for smaller customers.
 I like Ubiquiti Unifi's APs but switches are very very limited and, as far as I see, don't support stacking for Spine-Leaf design with the core switch formed by two or more stacked switches. The controller approach works very well for the APs and switches, but the later are somewhat still lacking features.
 Has anyone tried Cisco Business Dashboard? Does it really solve the issue to manage and monitor all your local switches from one place? Are the switches good for "prosumer" customers (they look like SF/SG replacements)
 Any other solution you hace tried to solve this that does not involve an enterprice plataform like HPE IMC or Cisco Prime?
 ​
 Thanks.
 J.M.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning all from Philadelphia!
 On an AAD-joined inTune-managed laptop, an AAD user's profile went FUBAR, so I deleted the user using the local admin account, settings, system, advanced system settings, users. Logged off, intending to re-add the user. For no particular reason, I tried to log the user back on with his Win Hello PIN (which I knew because I had set him up and he hadn't changed it). I was surprised that the login was successful; it went right to a new-user Windows Hello setup, where I reassigned him the same PIN.
 It's concerning that the laptop cached the PIN after the user and profile were deleted. I wonder if I had waited, or rebooted, or ... something, if the PIN would have gone away. It strikes me as insecure.
 Does anyone know if this is expected behavior? Shouldn't the deletion in Windows dig out and delete the PIN as well?

 Under Shared Folders on the Advanced Permissions I have both Enable Advanced Folder Permissions and Enable Windows ACL Support ticked.
 I have some shared folders including one called "Test".
 I go to the Test folder in Windows Explorer on one computer and authenticate to the QNAP as an administrator then set the permissions on "Test" using the Windows Explorer Security tab and add my normal domain user account so it has read only access.
 So in Explorer my normal domain user account now shows on the whole of the "Test" folder tree on the Security tab in Windows Explorer.
 When I try to browse the QNAP using my normal domain user account from a domain joined workstation I can browse to \\qnap but as soon as I try to browse into "Test" I get prompted for credentials.
 Entering my normal domain credentials doesn't work.
 Have I missed something please?

All connections pictured are layer-2 and all SVI's exist on the New Core already. ToR and New Core are Juniper virtual chassis, old core is an HP. My initial thinking is:
 Configure xe-0/4 and xe-0/5 on new core and ToR for a LAG group with lower STP cost and bring those up leaving existing connections. Thinking traffic will then begin utilizing those links and I can safely disconnect the xe-0/0 and xe-0/1 connections.

 I'm not sure how to remove the printer from this list. Any help pointing me in the right direction is appreciated.

 Basically when there is a power outage, despite the server being configured to automatically start, it does not when connected to the APC UPS. It works fine if it's plugged into the mains, if the power is interrupted it starts up again.
 Not only does this happen, but also the UPS won't deliver any power to the PSUs after the power comes back on. As a result I cannot even access iLO.
 In order to get the system to boot up again, I have to disconnect the power cables from the PSUs.
 Any insight would be helpful

 I’m having an issue where some of my endpoints never seem to install the updates from my WSUS server. I have the GPOs setup and 90% of the machines check in and install fine. I have adjusted the GPO so the machines check in every 3 hours to try and force them to download while they are online at some point throughout the day. Previously was set to every 16 hours by the previous guy. 
 I have noticed the GPO was setup to auto download and schedule the install. The schedule install day is everyday and install time set to 10am. 
 Is there a way to get the updates auto install at any time in the day when they are available to the endpoints instead of the set 10am schedule. If a laptop comes online after 10am the updates won’t install until the following day assuming it’s online before that time. 
 Is there also a command I can run to force a machine to check for updates? I have used pswindowsupdate before using PDQ inventory to run a remote powershell command to check and install updates to the endpoints but from my understanding that doesn’t log in the update history under the updates settings tab in Windows. (I may be wrong)
 Appreciate any advice

 My suggested solution to pushing new package updates is creating local repository, that is connected to internet, and all the other servers are connected to it.
 Is there more elegant solution than that?

 I'm new in an organization where there is no installed firewall and planning to implement one. Currently, we use Linksys LRT224's VPN to connect to each other. Main site and branch office has both Dual-WAN running on Failover. 
 I plan on using PFSense's Community Edition installed on a PC but not sure whether to put it behind the router or it should manage the Dual-WAN and then use the LRT224's VPN as is. Which is better? 
 Thank you very much and sorry for the broken grammar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on an RFP to re-fiber my org's main building. We are hub and spoke, with the datacenter in the basement and four closets, one on each of three upper floors with the fourth in an wing off the 1st floor. 
 Previous guy put in multimode fiber to all the IDFs, and it's only OM1. That was over 20 years ago. I'm pushing gigabit over it without issue, but want to go to 10g this year and work towards 25g in the near future, with 100g in the next ten years. So I'm planning to bring in contractors for a rip and replace, out with the multi and in with single mode.
 Question is, how many strands? I know could push 100s of gigs over a single strand, but that is $$$$$ carrier grade stuff... I'm looking for something more in the practical range, so that is duplex LC, or MPO/MTP, for speeds of 25g to 100g based on the Aruba equipment I have right now. 
 Looking at material cost, there's not a big difference between 6 and 12 strands armored plenum rated OS1. This is a fairly small job, short runs (longest is 400 meters). So labor is going to be more expensive than materials by my estimate. Looking at bulk cabling, I also see pre-terminated MPO/MTP 12 strand cable. Paired with fiber tray cassettes that accept MPO and break out into six duplex LC connectors, it seems to make sense for a degree of future proofing. I can use the LC breakout in the short term, and the higher density MPO connection is there for the future. The cassette system also seems nice, I can change the breakout if needed, without having to splice anything new.
 What would the downside of 12 strand be over 6 strand? Is there a downside to MPO vs LC terminations on the cable itself. Is there a downside to a breakout cassette versus spliced terminations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bit of an odd question but bear with me for a second.
 Let's say there's a router with three discreet Ethernet ports (each port can be its own network with a different subnet/supernet).
 Now let's say that all of these interfaces/subnets are using non RFC1918 IPs.
 So for example let's say 
  
interface 1 is: 75.168.2.x/24, 
 
interface 2 is 189.54.67.x/24
 
interface 3 is 7.90.85.X/24
 
 If an IP in the Interface 1 subnet sends traffic to an IP in the Interface 2 subnet will the router send that traffic internally between the discreet? Or will it attempt to send that traffic to the real location of that Dst IP?
 In short the router should know that 189.54.67.x/24 is being used for resources internally and the should send it inside rather than out, but with it crossing discreet NICs I wasn't sure.

 I've been asked by a client of mine to create a simple Web form that will be used to log daily work and materials used over the day for a small plumbing company, around 25 staff. Today this is done by filling out a form at the end of the day at the HQ and then the owner copies the papers manually over to Excel - and then he again manually creates invoices from that excel. He probably spends around 10-20 hours a week just doing this which is just bonkers.
 The form part seems simple and straightforward with Jotform for example but I wanted to check if you guys have any recommandations for other platforms that might be more suitable, and perhaps one that is easier to configure to dump the data straight into an Excel sheet with multiple pages/tabswithout going into too much much 3rd party autmation - if that is possible at all.
 Any ideas/thoughts appriaceted.

Windows Servers
 Local Admin users
 NAS drives
 Linux
 Backups
 Network (Switches/Firewalls/Vmware etc)
 Along with anything that has any form of admin access, so like door access
  
A good portion of these we've been able to protect with a mixture of native built in MFA, others we've had to do a bit of juggling with the use of jumpboxes, but some of our infrastructure doesn't have native MFA support. 
 I am currently in the process of talking to Duo about a possible solution, they claim they can pretty much MFA up any application. I would assume this is just sales jargon, or is there something I am just missing? I'm seeing documentation mention using a Radius server? This would also require the device/software to also support it? Or can Duo do something magical?

 I'm trying to write a python script that will get the 'Arp table dump' for a given Edge device on the network. Or, simply just be able to do a post request in Postman to retrieve this information for a given Edge.
 Looking through the documentation I can't find any methods in the REST API documentation for getting remote diagnostic data from Edge devices.
 I've been able to pull down data like Edge name and physical interface status using /getEdge but what would be great is to get the live data diagnostic data too.
 The VCO version is 4.3.1
 Anyone know if this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies in advance, I’m not a network guru. I’m only knowledgeable enough to be dangerous. 
 One of our clients has a few hundred streaming devices on their network. They asked if we could help give them a list of these devices, with their host name, IPV6 address, and MAC address, so they can do some forensics on an issue they are tracking. 
 We have the hostnames, and we can get the IPV6 address from there. We also have a list of the MAC addresses, but not coordinated with the hostnames. The devices do NOT have IPV4 addresses. 
 I’ve been trying to Google my way through this, but each hopeful answer I come upon doesn’t seem to work. Mostly they revolve around the “ip -a neigh show” command in some way, all saying that it should provide similar info to “arp -a” for IPV4. I do not, however, see any results that include a previously pinged IPV6 address or hostname. 
 I’m hoping there is another command, or even a different software/utility, I can use. Any help or tips would be appreciated.

The previously setup was a really off brand 1500VA UPS and 120V from the utility outlet in the room. Now, I have a 3000VA 208V ups and PDU in there for the switch gear. These last storms, the no name UPS caused the server to reboot every time it tried to switch to battery, as the batteries are probably lead-acid dust.
 I want to move the Dual PSU dell dervers from that unit to my 208V PDU. Dell appears to not let me use different input voltages across PSUs. WHY?!
 No amount of idrac configs on power configurations let me use the 208V. The green PSU light blinks a few times when connecting 208V power. I don't care if these servers reboot, but from a technical perspective, how could I do a power migration without downtime?
 I see a few dell threads about not being able to use mixed supply voltages, and would like to know if anyone else beat this weird limitation? I have never had a problem with any other vendor using mixed 120V/240V/208V, and this is the first time I am seeing this.

 In the tx-power field it says "No Power" and I have confirmed nothing is being outputted with a light meter. The interfaces are administratively up.
 This is the first time I've worked with any Nokia gear so it's entirely possible I'm missing something basic, but I can't find anything that looks relevant in the command tree.
 Any ideas?

The wifi signal is just not strong enough to run that many devices, especially streaming HD video. We are purchasing the Ethernet adapters for all of our Fire Sticks and will be hard wiring them individually. I will need a total of 2 switches to accomplish this, and have a few questions about compatibility and ease of use. Below is the configuration I will need:
 1 line out of the Nighthawk Router into the first switch. The first switch will feed 4-5 devices and the second switch. The second switch will feed 8-9 devices. All of the devices in question will be Fire Sticks. (I could feed the second switch from another port on the router if that would be a better solution.)
 1) I cannot think of a need for a PoE switch or a managed switch. Is there any reason why I may need one of those or can I use a Smart or Unmanaged Switch?
 2) Are these switches stackable and does my configuration sound correct or require any additional configuration?
 3) Which switches would work best with my specific router?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 What equipment or software do you all use for providing vendor access to your network? We are currently using Global Protect with a series of rules and HIP polices to check a vendor PC for security updates and AV, but I personally do not find this very easy to manage. It also brings up various other security concerns. Our vendors are mapping drives to their PCs and accessing internal web-services only.
 I am thinking of moving towards VM Jump boxes or an actual appliance for remote access. I'm curious what others have in place for a similar scenario.
 Thanks! 
 EDIT:
 This was an inherited process that I am trying to move away from for various reasons as many of you all posted in the comments. We have a few enterprise applications that can only be managed by the vendor. 
 We have LPA enabled with policies in the FW, but it is cumbersome and time consuming. 
 We've been looking at StrongDM, BeyondTrust, and I heard SecureLink out there too. This is the way IMO. So, any input on ZTNA or IAP would be much appreciated.

 The network provider provides free profiles publicly, but specifically advertises that they only support iPhones and not Android. I can add the link to the profile generator if there's no objections from moderators.
 The important parts from the mobileconfig:

 The profile also packages a PKCS1 cert.
 I've never touched a HS 2.0 network before from either side (as a user or operator), but I am interested in learning more about it!

However, if you have a small datacenter, 2 or 3 racks, with a pair of Nexus core switches with VPC, what are the drawbacks of bringing all endpoints, mainly servers, directly to the core? In the old days, you would put FEX at top of each rack but those are basically line cards and all switching still happens at the core. Let's just imagine that cross-connects are not an issue so you can run cables from whatever devices on each rack directly to the core. With 2 core switches, you can have up to 96+ ports so port capacity should not be an issue. Properly managed, you can limit broadcast domains and access. I've seen arguments regarding TCAM and backplane throughput. Core switches should be non-blocking anyway. What else is there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be an r/sysadmin question, but I figure it's more of a network question because it deals with 802.1X and device authentication:
 Currently wrapping up work on 802.1X authentication for a client and we're using Windows NPS to authenticate MAC addresses for those few devices that either don't have certificate support or are too old to use modern encryption standards (please no comments about how this is bad practice - we know, but we're forced to play the hand we're dealt...)
 For MAC address authentication, this requires creating user objects where both the username and password are the MAC address in question. This works fine.
 However, I'd like to plan ahead and not have to bug the client every quarter to find out which of these MACs aren't needed anymore. Basically, if a device doesn't re-authenticate w/in 7 days, I want to have to manually add it back.
 Even though these MAC addresses are basically AD user accounts, when they're authenticated by NPS, none of their AD properties change, so I can't just poll the last login date. Right now, I'm working on some powershell to scrape 7 days of event logs and remove anything without a successful NPS login. This should work, but I feel like this might be 'hard mode', so to speak. Is there a simpler way I'm not thinking of?

I have 1 public /25 subnet for servers with static IP addresses.
 Another subnet is a private /25.
 I have two edge routers and want to setup VRRP for LAN side redundancy.
  
Usually with VRRP there is only one subnet - so how would you do this? Can you setup multiple VRRP processes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reposting because Reddit spam filter decided it was spam and I didn't realize T__T.
 Hi All,
 Is it possible to somehow allow a user to a specific UNC path through an application (an ERP we provide access to has shared files/folders configured at a UNC path; it's required to be implemented this way through the ERP); however to *NOT* allow the user to navigate to the UNC path via Windows file explorer?
 So, for example, let's say there is a PDF attached in the ERP system for a specific user at path \\server00\folder1\file1.pdf and if the user is within the ERP system, they attempt to access the PDF, it launches whatever the PDF application is and they are able to view the PDF successfully. However, we do not want the user to navigate manually to the path \\server00\folder\file1.pdf as there maybe something within \\server00 that we do not want the user to have access to.
 I can *probably* do individual permissions per user and it will work however...it's over ~400 users and managing that will be a nightmare...
 Ideally, I'd like to turn off UNC path access but allow it through the ERP application access. I know you can turn off UNC access via GPO and I tested this already but then it breaks the access through the ERP application when the user is logged in as well.
 Thanks for any feedback!

In order to prevent attacks like CVE-2023-23397 we want to block all outgoing SMB connections that are not going to private cidr ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0, etc..) entirely, blocking this attack vector for future vulnerabilities like this one. Preferably we would like to use the Windows firewall for this, because we have no control over home routers and blocking these connections from home workers using company laptops. We can however control the Windows firewall rules using powershell on all of our endpoints, but I cant seem to block outbound SMB connections at all. We want to deploy firewall rules using this example powershell:
 New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block SMB connections to public IP subnets" -Direction Outbound -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 139,445 -RemoteAddress "0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255","11.0.0.0-172.15.255.255","172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255","192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255" -Action Block 
 It adds the block rule on top of the list wwith outbound rules, but somehow SMB connections keep working, even if I add our local NAS device to the RemoteAddress list.
  
Windows firewall is enabled
 Rule is present in all profiles
 ChatGPT had no useful tips for me 🫣
  
Anyone know how to do this using Windows firewall?

 We had one domain that had a different password expiration setting from our others. I changed the policy so that now they are all the same. However, my own Password Expires information is still set based on the old setting.
 Does this just take a while and eventually my expiration date will update to reflect the new setting? Or does the expiration date get set when you change the password and it won't reflect the new setting until I change it next?
 Thanks.

 I am not a developer and not very familiar with how it all works. I just need to install OpenJDK on some devices.
 We are deploying OpenJDK from Adoptium. No issues there.
 But I want to understand the differences between the various version.
 I understand that it is advisable to install the LTS version. That is fine.
 However, which version?
 If I install version 17. Will it be backwards compatible with apps requiring version 8? Can it break something if I upgrade from version 8 to 17?
 I can install them one next to the other. But what would be the use-case for that? Isn't it cleaner to just keep one version installed?
 For someone that is not familiar with Java, it is very confusing. Hope some of you can shed some light on it. Would be highly appreciated.
 Thank you

 Hopefully someone here might be able to help..
 On mobile devices: Sign in with work credentials, it sends a 2FA auth to my phone, I accept/enter 2fa cade, and the VPN gets turned on
 On Windows, i go to the app and it takes me to Windows VPN settings.
 I set it up, enter my login info, then try to connect and it never tries to get my 2FA code, it’ll make the attempt but then says it failed or timed out.
 Does anyone know how to get 2FA to work with Windows 11 on Cisco AnyConnect VPN?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI! I'm trying to move a fiber connexion at work from a router port to a switch port so we can remove some redundant legacy router. Here is the the general idea:
 from:
 Provider fiber -> Media converter -> Router -> Switch (access port) -> Firewall cluster vlan interface (via trunk port from switch) 
 to:
 Provider fiber -> Media converter -> Switch (access port) -> Firewall cluster vlan interface (via trunk port from switch) 
 Now when I plug the media converter port to my access port, STP reports port BROKEN for "Shr *TYPE_Inc" so it doesn't work. My understanding is that the other end is trunking and im doing access port so it's expected behavior. 
 Now can someone confirm if I'm understanding this correctly and why this is working fine when connected to a router port? Also works if I skip the switch and plug directly into the port of one of the firewalls in the cluster (probably same reason why it works on router port).
 Switch port config:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/18 description 160-VLAN switchport access vlan 160 switchport mode access speed 100 end 
 Router port config:
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 description WAN ip address x.x.x.x 255.255.255.248 ip nat outside speed 100 no negotiation auto 
 What throws me off it when the media converter is plugged to my switch, the other end (what I see as gtw) can ping my firewall interface correctly but I can't ping them (again, that gtw). 
 Thank you!

 Long time lurker and this is my first time posting on here. I am 20M and will be graduating with my BSIT this December. As part of our degree program we are required to complete an internship. I recently received a job offer as an Intern where I will be working directly under a Senior Sys admin. I am a little bit nervous as this is not only my first job in IT but also my first Job in a professional office environment. I really want to do a good job and be a valuable member of the team but I am a little bit unsure what skills/technologies I am expected to be competent in as the job description was quite vague. I feel comfortable with basic stuff like configuring VMs and basic network troubleshooting but I definitely still have a lot to learn. I was wondering if anyone here could give me some advice as to what I should become familiar with before I start in May? What tools/technology’s do sysadmins use daily that would make me stand out if I am familiar with? Any advice anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for any formatting mistakes as I am on mobile. Thank you.

 https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785452/microsoft-windows-10-future-feature-updates-annual-2022 says 14 October 2025, but I don't know where they get that date from.

 There a few other sites with October 2025 as well.

 ​
 I've got the follwoing problem. 
 ​
 We have a customer who fused with another Company. 
 They are connected via IPSEC and some resources like Ticketing system is only available via Internal IP example: ticket.corp.com -> 10.10.10.10
 Some resources for Marketing and such are hosted in Azure like marketing.corp.com -> 20.30.40.50
 Now.
 ​
 If I create a Zone on my DNS Server which holds corp.com then I need to add all known A records and such, right ?
 Zonetransfer isn't an option since the other corp still has another MSP and they aren't really of the fastest type.
 ​
 What would be a good route here ?

 We have a lot of Microsoft Surface devices, most of which I've inherited. I've dealt with the inability to replace the stupid glued-on keyboards, get at the insides or replace cracked screens. I've never understood why, but worked around, that a reinstall of W10 from a standard USB stick doesn't include drivers for the touchscreen, keyboard or mouse and there's only one fucking USB slot on the side. It's your fucking operating system you halfwits and you can't even include basic drivers for your own fucking hardware. I just can't even.
 Today I've taken my first delivery of three Surface Laptop 4 devices. They've got the usual lack of chipset drivers with the new lack of any network drivers whatsoever. Gets better - the only way I can seemingly get Surface drivers from Microsoft is to download a helpful executable or MSI, that then checks whether I'm on a Surface Laptop 4 (spoiler: I'm not) and then refuses to let me have the contents. I can't even "unzip" it as the CABs inside obfuscate the filenames so they're useless.
 FOR FUCKS SAKE MICROSOFT. SORT YOUR SHIT. I'VE BEEN THE GUY QUIETLY STICKING UP FOR YOU SINCE BEFORE YOU SHIPPED THE COMPLETE CLUSTERFUCK THAT WAS WIN95A OR WHEN I HAD TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO ARSE ABOUT WITH GETTING 3.1 ON A NETWORK. I'm tired of having to increasingly try to work around you "making life easier" for me. I'm tired of you renaming and reorganising everything every three months but not updating your documentation. I'm just tired.

This leads to confusion and inefficiency, and we primarily use PowerShell for scripting. I'm looking for a free tool to help manage automated scripts for our team.
 Ideally, the tool should offer central management for creating scheduled tasks, associate each script with a person and description, and run scripts from a central source. We tried Rundeck, but it was too complicated for our needs. 
 Can anyone recommend a free tool that would be suitable for our team size and focus on Windows servers? Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

 In you experience do I need to create a logical diagram (LAN, VLAN, VPS, etc.) or it's better to have also a physical one (with all the switches, all the physical servers, etc.)?

 If I select Allow org to manage device it fails with error 8018001C. This error is basically pointing towards not having Intune or MDM, MAM enabled and DNS records setup but they are.
 So is my thinking correct because its a session and not a device because its on a RD server is this the reason its happening? If I select app only it works fine so just want to know really for my own knowledge.

 Going round in circles so thought to ask the knowledgeable.
 I normally do this with my eye's closed but this is an inherited site and there's clearly something different I'm missing! 
 Server 2019.
 Our RDS SSL has expired, and I've got the new cert, added it to IIS on the Gateway. 
 I've then gone into RDS Gateway Manager, saw the warning about the SSL expiry.
 Went into properties, SSL tab, import, imported new certificate.
 Users who have a RDP connection on their desktop working fine.
 Users who use the rdweb connection, login to the site fine, download the RDP file, and - it says the cert is expired. It still shows the old cert in the downloaded RDP file. 
 All my bindings look correct. 
 Unless this server has something else in the mix I'm missing, any ideas why this isn't working?

 Which hypervisor has the best passthrough?
  
A PC failed. Running windows xp connected through USB to some exact measuring large machine and having license usb dongle plugged in the usb.
 A quote came back from the company that installed it and its like 15,000€ for upgrade. This is eastern europe so multiple it by 10.
 Waned to give it a try and move the machine to a VM, and Disk2vhd worked and I am playing with windows xp in a hyperv. 
 But apparently hyperv sucks when it comes to passing through USB. So next try is virtual box or esxi or proxmox/qmeu/kvm,... which with me having vhdx should not be difficult to move to.
 So anyone got some experience with usb passthrough in to VMs that is most reliable? I am thinking that option is also to get some PCIE usb card and that could be passedthrough too, As it works nicely with esxi and HBA cards in IT mode.

We are not going to rebuild them or force standardization except when systems are due for replacement. My first goal was security monitoring which is setup and shows there are challenges in the reliability of these networks. My next step is to setup centralized monitoring of network and hardware health. One site has PRTG already but in a half baked setup. Licensing across all these locations can be tricky and slow process due to the countries they are in. I wrote a plan to use Zabbix on all sites and am vetting a few experts to assist now. Does anyone have positive experience or nightmares about Zabbix for such a project?

We have had 7 situations were the client (Windows server 2019/2022 fully patched, static assigned IP) have deleted it owns A record, much similar with this one (except the windows versions..) https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/dns-host-record-of-a-computer-is-deleted-after-you-change-the-dns-server-assignment-f132a1fe-4867-df2b-a5fc-37557990d518
 The 7 situations have happened in 7 different ADs/VLAN with no connection to each other. DNS Scavaging is configured. The one oddly thing is that all these 7 servers are RD/GW/CB in a RDS farm (not the same farm, we have a farm in each AD/VLAN).
 Extremely weird and frustrating - any ideas? We have enabled DNS Client Events logging on two servers in a VLAN were it has not occurred yet.
 The solution so far has been to simple run "ipconfig /registerdns".

Although the account is disabled and poses no risk, the business would like this owner permission removed from everyone's account. We've taking a look at the sharepoint site permissions and can't find where or how he has done this. We know he's applied it to a top level somewhere as new accounts also have him included as the owner permission.
 I've looked everywhere for this bloody permission and I can't find it in the sharepoint admin centre, I'm hoping it's not something that was applied in the old Onedrive admin centre that doesn't exist anymore, if someone can help point me in the right direction that'll be appreciated.

 Apologies if this post meanders.
 I'm mostly network orientated, with a few Cisco certs but I see a lot of network jobs requiring on-call. I'm in my 40's now and just met someone and don't want this on-call stuff now. I have multiple area that I'm interested in, my latest Cisco cert being the DevNet Associate as I'm increasingly becoming more and more interested in a Python orientated job. However, I'm more geared towards using it for automation and DevOps kind of stuff, though I am also learning Django for a possible business idea, and I have an real interest in ML.
 Anyway, back to my original thought, my interest in networking has seriously waned over the last few years and was looking at cloud. I read that AWS is king of cloud platforms, however I also notice that here in the UK, I hardly ever see job requiring AWS, the vast, vast majority want Azure.
 Now I know as far as the customer is concerned, the difference between them at first glance is mostly aesthetic; different interface etc.
 Given that I really like working with Python, rather than Powershell, what would be a better option between AWS and Azure?

 I look at the GPO, and it looks correct. I look at the registry settings, and they make sense.
 Yet, on each scheduled evening of updates, nothing happens.
 Where have I gone wrong? Someone put me out of manual update hell!
 Mixture of Windows Server 2016 and 2019 servers. 47 servers in total, not getting updates on any of them :(
 No WSUS, direct to MS.
 Settings are:
  
Common GPO applied to all servers
 Example GPO applying updates per group of servers
 gpresult /h on a server, showing settings applied
 Resultant registry at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU
 Pastebin of Windows Updates logs. Was scheduled for 23:00, this is the closest set of logs thereafter
  
I've done a set of updates manually since applying the above settings. I've rebooted. I've checked the Windows Update service is running. There are updates waiting to be installed.
 Driving me mad.

 Hope you are having a chill day. 
 I was stupid enough to map a server to multiple users using a script that is placed in the startup folder.
 Now the time for migration has come and a new server has to be mapped instead of the old one.
 The new server is being mapped through the active directory using a script as well but they are interfering with each other.
 I use AD because I don't have access to policies. 
 What would be your best way of removing a script from multiple users' startup folders, without manually doing it on each laptop? 
 Thanks to all in advance.

 The past few months I've been elbow deep in Teams Calling and Intune MDM configuration.
 There seems to be alot of missing functionality missing, for example, in a Teams Auto Attended configuration, if a caller doesn't press a number for an option, Teams will just drop the call instead of having an option to push the call to a call queue. What if someone has accessibility problems that don't allow them to press or speak a number?
 For Intune, when you enrolled a device that is set to join a dynamic group based on the enrolment profile name, the initial configuration policy won't apply, as the dynamic rules aren't processed fast enough. 
 Surely a global billion dollar company would have the ability to plan the development scope and functionality testing.
 It's ironic how they are trying to force you to thier cloud offerings but can't even flesh these products out fully.
 Rant over.

 Does anyone know how to add a product image/photo to an inventory SKU label? I have been playing around with Dymo Connect, Zebra Designer on Microsoft and the Avery Design & Print website. Using the database function I can create unique SKU labels with OEM automative part numbers, SKU barcodes and qr codes to URLs from an excel spreadsheet.
 I can also add numerical counters to these functions. Making them sequential off the excel cell data which represents each donor vehicles individual ID number.
 What I would love is to add a product image to the label which is also the first image on the eBay listing.
 I can't seem to embed any images into the excel cell. All 3 label making softwares are reading the image from the database as text and displaying 'picture' instead of the image.
 I can manually add images to each label but it will take way too long. I would much prefer the images automatically generate onto each new label as the barcodes and other data does.
 Can anyone help me out or point me in the right direction?
 Thank you

So I am currently researching alternatives. I have zero experience with other virtualization solutions, but am pretty proficient in the VMware products (even hold a cert). So I hope a lot of the concepts are transferable to other vendors.
 The thing is: My research mostly led me to Proxmox or Hyper-V, for example, in home labs or rather small environments. Our environment is fairly large tho (about 200 hosts), so I am wondering, if solutions like the aforementioned are even scaleable to such an environment. Does anyone have any experiences with alternative virtualization products (HyperV, KVM, Proxmox, Nutanix, Citrix) on an industrial scale and can point me in a recommendable direction?

 I'm a sys admin troubleshooting a PXE server on one of my networks. Our service desk team is having issues using MDT to provision client computers (We are unable to use MECM / Intune for these at this time). Anyway, the long and short of it is that some workstations are able to contact the MDT server and others aren't. The ones that aren't are still able to contact the DHCP server located in the same subnet. Workstations receive an IP address, and then a message stating that "No boot offers were received."
 Here's a brief overview of this network:
 Workstations connected to CISCO L2 edge switches scattered across the building.

 When I was going through college I had the A+, Net+, Sec+, CCNA, etc.
 This put me ahead of the other applicants. It helped me get into some good jobs. 
 Now a decade later...
 Recently I've got 3 certifications. They haven't done shit for me. It's good to show I still learn.
 I was going for the CCNP-ENT, then CISSP, DC, SEC, etc.
 But in reality, nobody cares. They only care about experience after so many years it seems. 
 Half the guys we interview with CCNP can't explain what a VLAN is and what it does. It really gives IT certifications a bad name. I used to love them, but have decided to learn programming python and network automation instead. Maybe I'll get a cert in the future, maybe not. 
 You have to keep renewing them too. That's a huge pain in the ass. At least Cisco let's you learn new material and get those certifications updated. 
 In summary I think certifications are great to get you in and if your company requires it and pays for it plus a raise. Otherwise I think if you have a decade or more of experience it is useless. 
 What your your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello ,
 We want to take everyone off SMS mfa and only have them with password less mfa that shows location and app. 
 The problem is that a lot of people are using legacy mfa from the o365 portal and have registered their cell phone as a auth method. 
 I would like to turn that off as a option as a registration method, but I am afraid if I go into the legacy mfa portal and turn off phone method , it will lock people out. So, I am afraid I will have to reach out to each user and ask them to registration their auth method as Microsoft authenticator before turning off legacy auth and moving over to the new Azure authentication gui.
 Is there an easier way , to go about this migration?
 If I turn off phone registration as a option in legacy mfa portal in o365 , is there a possibility it would only be forward facing for new users, and people who still have SMS auth will still be able to sign in to m365 services ?
 Again, we want the only option as a registration method to be passwordless mfa with Microsoft authenticator .

I've gotten by by reverse engineering most the stuff so far, but any issues with the loop and it's over my head. 
 My problem, I know almost nothing when it comes to electricity. It's black magic to me. I know AC & DC exist, but I wouldn't be able to explain the difference beyond "hey, this is an AC wall outlet, and this is a battery powered device." Don't know how to use a multi-meter. Not sure how loops work. Not sure what polarity & reverse polarity is or how it works. Relays? Been hearing that a lot. I could point one out to you but couldn't tell you what it does. Normally open? Normally closed? Both are normally over my head. Voltage? Wattage? Amperage? You get the point. 
 I pretty much just want some resource suggestions that can help me form a solid foundation from the ground up. Starting from the most basics of basic that you'd teach a kid to some of the more advanced stuff that'd I'd need to know if I decided to be an amateur low voltage tech.

Why waste the energy, if you did no one would understand ya. None of my friends actually understand what I do, relegating it as 'black magic' or something like that. Talking to them is like talking to walls. Wife, yea, she might actually listen, but if she is she's not taking it in. you can hear her eyes glaze over.
 It's even like that at work. I mean at least no one cares what I do, I get left alone for the most part unless something takes too long. My boss understands, but you can't vent to your boss.
 Your hobbies either need you to work, or you just don't have the energy to do them any more.

 The worst part of being a sys admin, knowing your colleague will be fired before they do.
 Every time one of my coworkers, either in IT or not are about to be fired and I am made aware of it days in advance, it makes me nearly have a breakdown. We are a fairly small company, less than 200 people so I know everyone. On top of that, we are an even leaner IT team. Everyone but myself has a specialized role. I am a tweener that works between our SQL, Application and Infrastructure teams. I was made aware that my coworker who is the only other sysadmin in the company is being terminated over the next few days. I am sick to my stomach and the only saving grace is that my neck isn’t on the line. I am generally ok removing access once I get the word but I get in my own head leading up to it.
 How do you do it or am I just too soft?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 ​
 Beyond DNAC, we're starting to look at what Cisco has suggested for replacing SNMP for Wireless client monitoring, the YANG model stuff and using the telemetry subscriptions to retrieve/store and graph data. In full disclosure, we've had some internal talks with Cisco and have built a few prototypes using this great tutorial as a guide:
 ​
 https://www.wifireference.com/2020/01/14/viewing-network-telemetry-from-the-catalyst-9800-with-grafana/
 ​
 ​
 I've built this on a prototype and had a group with a lot more programming chops build the infrastructure and I'm getting to the point where the controller (for whatever reason) decides to close the connection and never re-establishes until I remove the config and re-add it (most likely just the receiver bit):
 test-9800-wlc-01#sh telemetry ietf subscription 30 re
 Telemetry subscription receivers detail:
 ​
 Subscription ID: 30
 Address: 1.1.1.1
 Port: 57000
 Protocol: grpc-tcp
 Profile:
 Connection: 12543
 State: Disconnected
 Explanation: Unknown reason
 ​
 This is the one subscription (I'd love to get 2-3 but I can't get one data set stable):
 ​
 telemetry ietf subscription 30
 encoding encode-kvgpb
 filter xpath /wireless-client-oper:client-oper-data/common-oper-data
 source-address 2.2.2.2
 stream yang-push
 update-policy periodic 6000
 receiver ip address 1.1.1.1 57000 protocol grpc-tcp
 ​
 (I redacted info - apologies if i inadvertently removed anything). I have confirmed through a packet capture that the data is not leaving the controller.
 ​
 Has anyone else run into these issues? I really hate to get to the point where every 4-6 hours I go in and re-issue the configs but I feel like we're stuck here. I have two controllers - one running 17.3.5(b) with non 6e APs and I'm going to try it on my 17.9.2 controller running minimal 6e APs. I'm wondering if it's load related.
 ​
 I do have a Cisco TAC case but since it's not a P1/P2, it's best effort with an already overloaded TACc team.

Recently our security team has brought in axonious but it's under their domain and from DC ops team perspective we are left with poorly maintained Excel sheets. I am hoping to get some decent suggestions for NRM tool with licence which can make our lives easier by maintaining all the data in proper nrm tool which also provides ipam support .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About 5 years ago I set up a small network for a restaurant in the Caribbean. They wanted some IP cameras, a POS system and a slot machine server installed. I used an inexpensive Netgear router, an unmanaged POE switch and an LTE box for internet. All cabling was Cat 5e. A year later they wanted to add a guest network for the adjacent hotel. I set this up, but used a completely separate network infrastructure. I used ubiquity APs due to budget constraints. My thought at the time was by separating the two networks, it would keep the business network bandwidth more secure and wouldn’t bog down the cameras with the guest network traffic. 
 Currently the business is expanding, adding several more buildings to the property, creating a campus like environment. They want Internet and cameras on all these new buildings. Since I have these two separate networks, I’m starting to realize that it’s going to be much more expensive and redundant putting two sets of switches for every building. Also a couple of the buildings are across a road with very rocky soil. Max distance between buildings is about 110 feet. I want to know the best way to proceed with this project. I have a few questions:
 1) How are networks designed for say college campuses or hotels with several buildings when it comes to critical networks and simple Wi-Fi? Do they separate things?
 2) Is there any reason to keep the two networks separate in my case.
 3) What is the best way to segregate the network traffic, forming a more secure, prioritized network for the POS and camera, and a less secure network for guest WIFI?
 4) I want to use fiber to span the buildings, but If I am forced to use PTP wireless bridges (due to very rocky soil), can I use one PTP bridge to support 2 vlans?
 Thank you in advance for your help. As I am still a novice at this, problems like this are a great way to learn about this industry.

 How would you go about validating with offices had only one router versus which ones had two or more routers? What tool would look into subnets and subnet masks to determine what connects where? And would that tool identify Ethernet wAN interfaces and their connectivity?
 I know redundancy and diversity are different animals. What would correlate circuits from different vendors, or would you relay on ifdescr field?
 And how would you validate that traffic that normally goes over an MPLS circuit would take an alternate path in a failure?

The users have grown accustom to doing all their work via the file explorer and ever since the sharepoint migration they’ve been agitated that they have to navigate the sharepoint for their files, then download them so they can attach them to whatever application their working with whether it be word or outlook. We’ve created workarounds to alleviate the tediousness of this but I’m still baffled at my bosses approach. 
 When I ask why we can’t attach the SP to the file explorer my boss just says “it’s a security risk” without any explanation! I’ve tried looking this up but can’t seem to find any concrete explanation as to why it would be a security risk. Is this an SMB issue that I’m not aware of ? Any insight is appreciated. Thanks.

 How do you appropriately move it?
 Things I've tried in the past:
  
Recycled other leftover boxes that have not been thrown away yet. Spare boxes are not always guaranteed to be available.
 Placed equipment in spare static bags. Static bags are easy to stock up. They provide protection from the elements. However, when stacking 2 or more devices in static bags they tend to slide around and are in danger of falling off the cart.
 Simply carry it under my arm or on a cart and walked down the street. This feels very wrong and unprofessional. My location gets a log of rainfall so this is not always feasible. Equipment is in danger of sliding off the cart or being dropped if I trip over a curb.
  
I know rule#1 is always use a company vehicle for insurance reasons, but what are the other rules you follow to ensure equipment is relocated safely?
 I'm considering something like this https://tripplite.eaton.com/4u-server-shipping-case~SRCASE4U to my boss since it seems like a good low-cost solution, but wanted to get other opinions.

The problem I have is that our Telecom team will not fix issues if we cannot show fault with cable which we are currently limited to physical inspection, troubleshooting by testing a variety of devices, or cable diagnostics on switch.
 I will include the situation I am currently facing just in case I am missing something:
 The mentioned time clock will work on the same port with a jumper cable with no failures.
 The time clock will work fine on other parts of the same site. (Lounge, Office, Etc.)
 The time clock will freeze at random intervals. (Mostly within 1 weeks time)
 Switch has same config as all other time clocks on site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, we are moving to Extreme and going to be taking advantage of their fabric tech for our new multi campus network. We are coming from a stable and reasonably complicated network with IP routing to the access layer and separate VLANs and subnets on every switch for distinct devices types. 
 We are looking at ways we can build upon our existing design and stability but take advantage of features that fabric that mean we can change the design to suit each system. One thing that interests me is the possibility to move back to having L2 segments spanned across the entire estate and assigning a /24 subnet for a particular system such as CCTV. We can then give the service owner the /24 and tell them wherever they install their devices they will sit on the same subnet and if the system doesn't work they can't complain about devices not working over L3 when communicating with each other etc. 
 One of the problems with this approach is deciding where to put the gateways, what to push to the firewall or to keep on the core. We were looking at pushing critical devices gateway to our firewall for most control but also I am wondering about VRFs/segments and controlling traffic with routing rather than just spanning L2 to our firewall?
 Any advice or tips appreciated on how to best take advantage of fabric without making a mess. Cheers!

 Script runs fine, and the wifi profile is added. However you cannot join it. Wifi is not listed in available networks (even though it is available). 
 if you add the network manually (Hidden Network > same ssid > same password as the xml) it says unable to connect. 
 You must first go to known networks and forget the network that was added by the script and add it again manually for it to work.

 for those not privy with Dell dock issues, it seems the docks get out of sync and think the laptop is off when it is in fact ON. so you get "No Signal" on your screens.
 easy enough unplug, shut down, close lid, plug in and from dock power on. boom they are in sync and all is working well, until next Tuesday when it happens again. I get parts of Missouri have shite infrastructure, maybe we have power blips but, they are all on UPS. 
 Even if they weren't the firmware should be smart enough to figure out it's out of sync.
 I ran through Dells support and they suggested RMA and asked if they meant all 72 docks, they said yes. I told them need one heel of a truck and pallet, they assured me they have an RMA team for this.
 Talk about wasting their own money! (I asked for an escalation)

 Microsoft article about this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5021130-how-to-manage-the-netlogon-protocol-changes-related-to-cve-2022-38023-46ea3067-3989-4d40-963c-680fd9e8ee25

 " Ivanti Dev team has made changes in the code and fix will be available in ICS's firmware releases tentative for April 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I have 4 accounts that need to be migrated from GoDaddy’s 365 to a normal Microsoft 365 account. 
 3 of these accounts will be converted to shared inboxes, because the client was using generic accounts like “service” or “scheduling” that multiple users would log into. 1 of these accounts is for the owner.
 I’ve seen the bittitan and migrationwiz ways to migrate, but I am wondering if I could just simply backup the mailboxes to a pst from GoDaddy since there are only 4 of them, and just upload the pst to the new Microsoft accounts I’ve created and licensed. 
 Once I do this, can I delete the 365 plan from GoDaddy, and then the tenant would automatically be released so I can change the mx records to point at the new Microsoft account, or would I have to contact Godaddy to release them?
 If they have onedrive documents, I am assuming I would also have to backup those. 
 TLDR: I am just wondering if there is an easier way to do the GoDaddy 365 to Microsoft 365 migration if I only have 4 user accounts, and 3 of those will be converted to shared mailboxes.

 For our unused ports, we always put them in access mode, assign to a dead vlan, and then shutdown the port. 
 With that said, should the command still be applied to the unused port since it is an access port? The reason I ask if a lot of the findngs will say something like "all user/host facing access ports", but this one specifically says "all access ports".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Context: We have a Wi-Fi network called CBNet that is set to auto-connect to Chromebooks under our domain, and it is a hidden network.
 ​
 We have two Dell 3100 Chromebooks and one Dell 3100 2 in 1 Chromebook that we sent out to a company called "ITurity" for repair. The company swapped the motherboard in all the Chromebooks with another. To get the motherboard to sync with the Chromebook, they entered Dev Mode and switched the serial number to match the original Chromebook.
 When we got them back, it prompted us to re-enroll them, so we did. Now, the Chromebooks all have the same issue. When using wireless, it does not auto connect like it is supposed to. You can manually enter the CBNet Wi-Fi and password and use the Chromebook, but once you power off an on again, it doesn't auto-connect (although you can still click on the network and connect because the SSID and password are saved.
 We called the company, and they said that it is not an issue they've had, and they bought their motherboards from different manufacturers for the 3100 and 3100 2 in 1. We have tried an OS recovery, but we can't powerwash because we had it disabled in the Admin Console (it still appears to be disabled). We also can't powerwash through the console. It shows the last activity on the Chromebooks as months ago. When connected to the network with an ethernet to USB adapter, you can login to the Chromebook and use it.
 We have tried manually connecting to other Wi-Fi's, and that works the same as with CBNet. The only difference is that when connecting to the CBNet network, there is an exclamation point to the bottom right of the Wi-Fi symbol.

 Any help would be appreciated!!

I have a ton of experience dealing with all sorts of hardware, software, peripherals, etc. With the contracting world there comes times when you must job hop for one reason or another. Mostly I only hop when my contract is coming to an end and the current company hasn't been able to place me on another contract. So that means that I have to interview all over again, which I don't mind. The part that I do mind is having some cocky kid ask the most asininely questions to me during an interview about my skills or background. I'm not sure whether they are meaning to be asses to show their worth to their boss and use me as their example or if they genuinely do not know how to do an interview. For example, only a few years ago I had this guy ask me what I would do if a user reported they were having an issue while printing. Seriously??? A freaking printer problem?? That's Tier 1, at best, and I'm Tier 2/3 my entire career since about 1995 and this guy asks me about a printer issue and how I would resolve it?
 So, what's the most assinine thing you've been asked during an interview as part of your experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to understand something. My company is trying to migrate an on-premise ERP (Sage 300) to the cloud. We were advised by Sage's business partner in my country to set up a cloud instance with 16 GB of RAM, 4CPUs and 120GB SSD storage which we did. However, we logged in four simultaneous users and it seemed to be a bit sluggish. Given that during normal business operations, we'll have more than 10 simultaneous users logged in, this didn't seem like a good fit. Now, the confusion is this, the business partner had asked for a lot of money to set the server up. They say that there is a way you set up the server so that it becomes faster, he even mentioned that he has a server with the same specs handling more than 18 simultaneous users logged and working seemlessly. The question is, what is this "way" they are talking about? From my understanding the steps of setting up a server are pretty standard, I mean, chose the package (In my case AWS Lightsail) and then launch it. Are there any tips and tricks I am missing? A new installation I believe doesn't come with heavy and buggy software that would slow down the server. Oh, the operating system in question is Windows Server 2016.

 So last Friday, after the last straw was put in this camel's back, I gave my notice. I did so because I have become so burned out that I'm a massive cynical ass.
 I won't go into details as to why I have end-up so burned out but let's just summarize it as being underpaid and underappreciated. I have end-up having a toxic relationship with work of "let us see who takes the piss more out of the other". I have been working for 28K a year and have been asked heaven and earth for it. I gave it my all for over a year before I began to give up and stayed to build a CV as this was my first fully fledged Sys Admin job, I have been here for 3 years in total. In my previous place, I was paid 22k a year for a semi-Sysadmin job where I implemented some stuff that saved the company thousands and t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago one of our APC broke down, and I ordered a replacement. In the meantime, half of the physical infrastructure is directly plugged into the wall, which is not ideal.
 We are running a 3 nodes VMware infrastructure with 2 SANs and one of the impacted devices that was previously plugged into the failing APC is a core switch that is dedicated to storage, so basically directly plugged to both SANs and 3 nodes. The switch itself is member of a stack, but with only two members (one commander and one standby) which means both switches are actually active, so I cannot simply unplug it or it might cause outages and it's especially dangerous with the storage for our VMs. 
 My question is : what would be your approach to unplug that switch with minimal impact for the end user ? Is there a way from vCenter to pause the infrastructure easily, and resume, and will that be enough to safely unplug the switch ? 
 I don't have much knowledge and I'm the sole IT for a medium size company, and I have no experience dealing with this. 
 Pausing the infrastructure is acceptable for a short timespan but I want to make sure that I am doing everything that is needed to ensure that no Vm integrity is at risk.

 Basic situation: given a company with a small site with several departments, the floor space itself is quite large, so several rack cabinets are placed due to the distance (100 m) between network and end device. The question is: what solution could be offered for this?
 My idea is to have several air-conditioned rooms where the rack cabinets are arranged, and where necessary because of the distance, e.g. between a computer and a switch in a rack cabinet, I would solve it with an optical cable, using a media converter.
 Would this work?

 I made a small dent in a 6a cable when attaching it to the wall. The dent was small (~3mm long, width like the cable itself, depth ~1mm) and the cable came back to it's normal shape after few minutes but I'm still wondering if I should buy a new one - because I know it's a fragile thing. Beside the dent, there was no other visible damage and I don't have a way to test the cable - I can either keep it and pray it will work or buy a new one and try to replace it before we will finish the wall. I know it's difficult/impossible to determine the damage by a description and a "text drawing" - I just hope to find someone who maybe had a similar experience and can share his/her expertise. For few minutes the cable looked like this:

 I'm confused to what dictates the forest functional level.
 We have a lot of servers in our estate (100+), where there still a couple of 2008 R2 VMs kicking about, that we are in the progress of decommissioning and moving onto 2022. I've recently inherited the setup here so trying to get all sorted and all up to 2019 / 2022.
 Our domain functional level is 2012 R2 as we still have 1 2012 R2 DC that's due to be replaced with 2022 in the coming months, but I've noticed our forest level is showing 2008 R2. I decommissioned a 2008 R2 DC yesterday, and increased the functional level to 2012 R2. Is that because of the 2008 R2 servers kicking about still or is it likely still updating in the background?

I have tried logging into the RDS database, and took it offline and back online - this made no change.

 The Technical Element
 Design for change
 - The old google mantra is right. Design for change. Change is having to deploy new software, upgrade existing software, scaling, equipment breaking, and people shifting around.
 - Everything in this mantra is about finding balance. You might think it's a good idea to tightly marry your system to a particular OS or Linux distro. It's just as bad of an idea to separately them entirely. Use layers and a _little_ indirection if you must.
 - This does not mean complete and total platform agnostics. It's about making one system two, two systems twenty. Dealing if a sysadmin gets hit by a bus, if that dangling harddrive dies, if someone runs rm -rf /. It's for the incremental changes. Security update…]]></summary>

 The device is authenticated to WiFi using its own device certificate, but once the user logs in, authentication is handed over to the user. Since the user has never logged in, they haven't requested a certificate from the CA, so it therefor can't connect. 
 The only way around this is for them to login for the first time while connected to ethernet, and do a "gpupdate /target:user /force" which carries out the user's CSR and certificate issue process. Not ideal. 
 Anyone got an idea on how to work around this, besides stopping user-handoff all together?

 I’m working on syncing Teams documents to devices via OneDrive for business, allowing end users to be able to access the files within File Explorer on Windows 10.
 I’m having some issues with file path lengths and hoping someone could steer me in the right direction.
 In article 1 is says "SharePoint Online and OneDrive have a 256-character limit on Windows PCs. If you exceed the character limit, you receive an error message when you try to do anything within the synchronized document libraries, like creating folders or renaming documents."
 However, in article 2 it says it can be up to 520. Is anyone able to advise on what the source of truth is please? Additional information at the bottom if you have questions.
 Article 1 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/change-address-contact-and-more?view=o365-worldwide
 Article 2 - https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa
 Why am I doing this? – The organisation name is really long and it significantly cutting into the file character limit count
 Have you tested this? – Yes I have and I’m getting stuck at 256/260 characters. However, this could be down to the ‘long file paths’ setting, which I am struggling to get working. I don’t want to further troubleshoot the ‘long file paths’ not working correctly if it’s not going to be supported in the first place.
 Kind Regards,
 Max

The email was one of those typical ones where the actor reaches out to say they have an urgent task for an employee. The FROM email address is the real email address of the manager though and there is not a alternate "Return Address" header so a reply would go directly to the manager. (The manager's account has been checked and is definitely not compromised).
 From the headers I can see that the email originated from a goDaddy server and that the SPF check passed on that basis. My gut feeling here is that someone is "playing" with one of goDaddy' servers here which is why there is no "Return Address" set.

 The issue is that the script is too slow to work on an environment of our scale. We have 37k mailboxes and receive almost a million emails each day.
 At two minutes a mailbox, the time to process would be 50 days.

 Just got hired at a startup as the first in-house IT hire. The company previously worked with a contractor who worked after hours, and needless to say, didn’t put much effort into doing things the right way here…he never had anyone to check his work! Anyways, the company has been using Google Drive as their corporate file system for its first couple of years and I’ve been tasked with cleaning it up and setting it up as a traditional file system used in corporate environments…
 So just wanted to see how other companies are using Google Drive and how other sys admins are setting it up? For context, there are hundreds of thousands of existing files, permissions are a mess, and no department is open to restructuring lol. What’s the best way to rip off the band-aid here and use it as efficiently as possible?
 Thanks!

 Environment is Office 365 E3. No third-party email filtering.
 In the past week I have been receiving a lot of false positive SPAM emails. Internal emails and Microsoft emails are ending up as SPAM and going to junk. Customer emails as well. We also noticed we cannot invite more than 10 customers to meeting.
 It is even impacting systems where we allow spoofing and impersonation such as our SAP system. Those are also going to Junk.
 I have a Premier Support ticket opened, but so far it is not resolved.
 My though is Microsoft turned up their filtering in response to Outlook zero-day (CVE-2023-23397).
 Has anyone else noticed this recent uptick in false positives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm the network engineer at an organisation with around 130 branch sites spread across New Zealand and overall around 4000 users.
 We have Meraki SD-WAN, switching and wireless at the moment. We are backhauling all traffic from branch sites back to a Meraki VPN concentrator in our DC and breaking out to the internet via Fortigate firewalls. We are in the process of migrating most of our on-premises server infrastructure and services to public cloud and eventually there may not be a need for an on-prem DC firewall.
 I've been tasked with coming up with a plan to locally breakout traffic at branch sites. Personally, the UTM/NGFW capabilities on the Meraki's are rubbish and nowhere near Enterprise grade compared to what we have with Fortigates. The logging and overall visibility is extremely limited compared to FortiAnalyzer as well.
 I've started looking into SASE solutions. The easiest to integrate with our existing Meraki kit is Cisco Umbrella. However, Cisco does not have an Umbrella PoP here in New Zealand so I would be forced to tunnel all traffic to Australia (Sydney or Melbourne) which is a dealbreaker. From past experiences and aside from concerns with reliability, this would not work for us with websites getting geo IP redirected to Australian sites, sensitive sites such as banking, etc.
 I'm interested to know your experiences with any of the below which I've identified as having a local PoP here in New Zealand.
 Zscaler
 Palo Alto Prisma
 Cloudflare
 Cato Networks
 Netskope
 It's a bit hard as you can imagine to read past the marketing fluff and gimmicks to know how these products truly perform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 My mother is opening a restaurant and needs some help with setting up a network for the business. I'm an IT professional with a focus on Azure/AWS security & compliance. While I have some networking experience in my homelab, I'm seeking some guidance because of some key constraints that I have to navigate.
 Here are the requirements:
  
One subnet for a POS system called Toast. This subnet is highly managed by the vendor. No "unauthorized devices" can be connected to this subnet. The vendor provides a Meraki Z3 router and an unmanaged switch. Downstream from those, there'll be two receipt printers, three POS kiosks, and a cash drawer. Endpoints on this subnet will be hardwired. No wireless.
 One subnet for all non-POS equipment. For this, I'm planning on purchasing a Meraki Go Router Firewall and a Meraki Go Access Point. Endpoints on this network will all be wireless. No hardwired. 
  
We'll have five static IP addresses available. The kicker is that Toast POS explicitly forbids the presence of an intermediate device between the ISP's gateway and their router. Normally, I'd put a router firewall in front of the Toast POS router and isolate it on its own VLAN. Since I can't do that, I'm not quite sure how to create two subnets while meeting the POS requirements. Is it possible to connect both routers directly to the gateway, assign a static IP to each, and isolate the traffic on the gateway? I suppose that will depend on the capabilities of the gateway device. Comcast hasn't told me what unit we'll be getting yet. 
 Just looking for some guidance here. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've been struggling recently on making up a (what should be) simple network topology. Link is here: https://imgur.com/a/unD88qC
 For background: 1. I want PC 1, 2, and 4 to be able to talk to each other 2. All PCs within their own boundary should be able to talk to the other PCs within that boundary only (with the exception of above)
  
I can not modify the IP addresses already assigned (everything is on a 192.168.1.0/24). I can change the gateways.
 
I can not modify the switch attached to 1.50 and 1.75, assume its an out-of-box L2 switch
 
 I'd like to use ACLs to complete this by controlling the outgoing traffic from each layer 3 switch. (i.e Fa0/4 with an out ACL to stop PC5 from reaching outside its boundary).
 To my understanding one (of many) would look like (middle switch):
 interface FastEthernet0/10
 ip access-group TO_NORTH out
 !
 ...
 ip access-list extended TO_NORTH
 permit ip host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.1.50
 permit ip host 192.168.1.1 host 192.168.1.50
 !
 I recognize there's an implicit deny at the bottom, that should cover anything not listed from "leaving" the "boundary". After I apply this ACL to the port, for some reason all traffic no matter the source or destination still passes through that switch, port, and ACL as if it was never applied.
 ​
 I think i've dug my mind into a rabbit's hole and have confused myself over what I believe should be rather easy. Do I need to have routing enabled or GW set somewhere specific? 
 if there's any more info i can provide, lmk
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I have a NetBox server with 2 CPUs and 8GB of RAM. It also runs a webhook handler specific to NetBox. These webhooks will make basic changes via Ansible, like update a port description or change a port's mode based on updates to interfaces. However, there have been times where I've tried to update 10+ interfaces at a time, which will then cause the webhook handler to take on 10 webhooks/execute 10 scripts at the same time. This seems to spike CPU usage for varying amounts of time, depending on the number of interfaces I attempted to update. The spike causes the VM console to freeze up and often causes some of the webhooks to not execute properly.
 I'm just curious if anyone else is using their NetBox server as a webhook handler, and if so, what specs it's deployed with to get it to work smoothly. I made a post in r/Netbox, but figured I'd add it here as well for exposure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 My company has recently gotten a Cisco C1101 Integrated Services Router to sub-divide our currently flat network. I have used routers before I have used switches before but not an “L3 Switch” as this is known as. Interface g0/0/0 is the L3 “WAN” and g0/1/0~3 are L2 “LAN” ports. I literally just want this to act as a router between the company firewall and our domain controller but I can’t for the life of me get it sorted. What I’ve done so far is create two VLANs that are assigned to two ports each example VLAN 20 is on g0/1/0-1 , VLAN 30 is on g0/1/2-3 This is only a 4port switch plus the WAN port. I assume I need to do PAT on the device but am struggling. Any advice at all is much appreciated, I will answer whatever questions you got for me to the best of my ability. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this fits here, but it's a thing that happens mainly at work so ehh, mods can decide.
 Basically I'm wondering how you guys manage forgetting things. I'm a desktop guy at a small org, doing everything from help desk to server work. Intune management, laptop, phone setup, on off boarding, printer management, paper refilling, swipe card setup, desk relocations, visitor queries, water cooler repairs, the whole shebang.
 I have real problems with getting busy and forgetting what I was doing and I'm wondering how to manage this.
 I had a user ask me to do something, and between walking from one end of the office back to my desk and sitting down, I'd forgotten what it was was sitting down to do and proceeded to instead do the other two things I got asked about on the way. Sometimes I'll read an email and go to action it then forget what I was doing halfway through, or answer a question and then forget about the email completely. 
 It's this kind of forgetfulness that keeps getting me in trouble with the boss. How do you guys manage this when you run into it? I have rules on my inbox to flag emails as they come in now, as well as a task planner in teams, but I still keep running into these issues whenever I get busy.
 I've mentioned it to my boss before, but short of moving to paid overtime to clear my to do list I'm not sure what I can do. I'm one of the lowest salaried staff at my org from what I understand, but I can't move jobs because I otherwise like my job and can't do things like that in my life (if someone had a gun to my head and told me to move jobs or stand up for myself I'd just take the bullet)
 Anyway input on how to not forget things would be great.

 I have another offer in hand, relatively same pay, better benefits, and a promising culture. Is having a 3 month stint on your resume that bad? I'd also feel bad for getting trained up and then leaving almost immediately, but I refuse to work somewhere that values their employees so little.

 Anecdotally, I've read some people saying that companies are starting to think about moving back to on-premises for company servers to reduce cost.
 Is this actually starting to happen in a big way? Does this mean that there might be increasing demand for people that understand infrastructure and networking again because cloud infrastructure is getting too expensive?

 I got some really good words, camaraderie, and advice from this community. I had already been taking some responsibility on our Azure defender for cloud solution, and I'm happy to report that my boss supports me jumping in with both feet and getting more on the security side of our operations. 
 This has reinvigorated me within IT. I have already completed the AZ-500 coursework, and have the cert scheduled for next week. I have not failed a single practice test yet. The stuff just makes sense to me, it clicks. Then I plan on pursuing the SC-100 to obtain my Azure cybersecurity architect expert cert, and hopefully have that done here in the next month or two. 
 I wanted to thank everybody that came in and showed me some support and camaraderie when I was down in the dumps and not seeing a way out. I took some of your advice and I'm running with it, and happy to report that I am interested and excited again in the things I am now doing.
 From an old salty dog in this industry, a big thanks to my fellow IT warriors out here.

 What tool do you use to schedule maintenances and find (indirectly) affected services?
 Customers directly connected to a network element or a specific region are easy to filter, but we also have a lot of P2P connections, these can also be indirectly affected when intermediate elements are undergoing maintenance.
 These fall into two categories:
 a) indirectly affected, but re-routing possible
 b) indirectly affected, but no alternative paths available
 Thanks for your suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Just looking for some advise/anecdotes on what others have done. We are getting ready to open a new office and I've got some gear that the office will need. List includes:
  
Meraki Switches
 Meraki Firewalls
 UPS system
 Rack Mount PDUs
  
My preference is for a 4 post rack system but this office only comes with a Chatsworth 22Y9, which is a 2 post system. I haven't typically had to buy this equipment in the past as datacenters I've hosted gear in already come with 4 post rack systems and such. Is it possible/recommended to simply get a 2nd 2post rack and do a make shift 4 post system? Or should I just make a play and ask management to scrap the existing 22Y9 and spring for a 4 post rack?

 As an optimization for pure Data-Plane flood-and-learn process (multicast), BGP was extended so VTEPs could learn MAC addresses from BGP advertisements. This reduces the amount of multicast traffic caused by unknown unicast: once an end-host boots up and sends any packet, like ARP for the default gateway, that host’s MAC is learned and advertised into BGP so every VTEP will learn it and populate their forwarding table.
 Once a packet hits the VLAN access interface of a VNI, it'll check what VRF its apart of, if it'll use either the L2 or L3 VNI as the VXLAN ID depending on if the remote device is on the same VNI or another. The VTEP will either know to send the packet across to the other VT…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So PoE extension might not even be the best option here for me, and if it isn't you all have a better idea please feel free to recommend it. As it stands: I have a client that has a 1 Gigabit wireless bridge between two buildings. I have to move one of the Bridges in order to get it to line-of-site. Going up is not an option. I know you can buy Active PoE Extenders and daisy chain them together to get up to 1000 feet of ethernet (which is more than enough for what I need). 
 I am looking to extend the ethernet around 850 feet. What I'm confused on is Active vs. Passive. I was going to use an Active PoE Switch to power the ethernet extenders (I would need two). My issue is: the Bridge is Passive PoE (24v). I know Active 802.3-latest is "smart" and won't push power to the Bridge, but I am wondering what to do from here. Do I get a Passive PoE Splitter? Do I need to get one that is specifically 24v? 
 I am familiar enough with the 802.3af, 802.3at etc but I really need help understanding what to do at this point. And like I said, would I be better served to do something like an Ethernet to Fiber setup? I know I can get over 1000 feet from a setup like that.
 I'm just wondering what you all have in mind. I would really appreciate the help.

We have checked firewall settings, DNS settings, checked the switch, no network drops, very confused by this. This morning we had a new user report they could not connect to the internet. Meanwhile the other computers in the office are connected with no issues. The disconnects are so random and it will only happen on a few computers at a time in different areas of the office.

 I have the task of trying to get our WSUS server working correctly as it's been left in an unusable state.
 I would not consider myself experienced with WSUS or scripting however I'm always willing to learn and try my best!
 WSUS is currently running on Windows Sever 2012 R2 VM.
 WSUS Version: 6.3.9600 18694
 The two big issues I'm facing is it is extremely slow and it constantly crashes with failed snap in errors. with the majority of devices not being up to date.
 The cause in my eyes looks to be the fact the driver specification was ticked, meaning we have 674987 updates unapproved.
 I would like to decline all driver updates and purge them from WSUS and just have security updates and feature updates.
 I have unticked the driver classification and ran the WSUS Server clean-up wizard. However it does not seem to remove the current set of unapproved updates. I have also tried to run some script's found online but alas this has not worked either.
 Would really appreciate some help as I'm really struggling to make progress on this one.
 Thanks
 Sam

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been looking through our cloud storage providers, and seem to have 4 different ones we pay for. My girlfriend as a office 365 personal subscription, with 1TB. She uses many apps that are with it
 My idea is to move all our photos, documents video, and music to the 1 TB on 365. Then cancel all other subscriptions.
 A few questions, there seems to be a few different options for 365, if all the files go onto the personal account/cloud, can I from my one drive ,view everything if it is set to share with my MS account?
 Wondering whether to get the 365 family, apart from the 1TB per user, is there any advantage?
 All the apps/software which is available,is not really something I need.
 I also came across 365 Pro Plus, which I cannot figure out what it is exactly. It seems to be a one time payment, with the same as 365 personal or family is a renewable licence.
 Can anyone explain the difference?
 I hope this make sense what I ask.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about what plans people have in place (if any) for when the brown stuff happens.
 We have 2 core switches, in different physically separate buildings, each access switch links back to both.
 We have 2 firewalls, one in each building, 2 and ISP connections feeding both firewalls. Each of the buildings also has its own wan switches and wan routers.
 We back up EVERYTHING at our Primary DC which is located in our head office and to a DR site in a collocated data center about 3 miles away, we back up at least once a day (some systems backup hourly) using Veeam.
 We have a contingency plan for servers and systems if something kills primary sites. Realistically unless there's a power failure or some kind of apocalyptic event. Think worst-case, think the building Data Centre has been fired and both redundant cores are down.
 For the sake of discussion, let's assume you still have your off-site backups and application in the DR site, and both redundant core switch fails at the primary site. In that case, Servers and workstations lose connectivity to the network.
 How would you route end users to connect to the DR site?
 Has anyone actually dealt with such a scenario; how did it go? If not, what plan do you have or what is the suggestion?

I get to learn new stuff every day and absolutely adore that. Now to my question. How do you deal with office politics? I interface often with our c suite due to our helpdesk being very inexperienced so I end up spending about 15 hours a week fixing printers and explaining how to use word to people who make 3x what I do. I don't mind that part so much but it's a vipers nest up there and they keep dragging me into it. My boss does what he can and tells me to point them to him but then the same people are just even more pissed at me. I'm now getting more and more angry about the situations I'm pulled in to, mostly the accusations that IT doesn't do anything while I'm working 50-60 hour weeks to keep thing halfway working while I upgrade as much as I can. Any advice the greybeards can give?

 Has anyone moved into an area in tech for a company or project where you feel you are making a difference?

 I'm looking for a tool to monitor the connection to one of my servers, I have a feeling that the connection is resetting / dropping for a split second, not enough to show as a drop but enough to kick users off.
 I've tried ping monitoring but they are going through fine, I need something that is going to establish a connection between to points, either from a desktop to the server, or server to server to open a connection and keep it open, then monitor if it drops out.
 I've got either the same or similar issue on two sites, both running unifi kit, one is effecting sage 50, the other RDP connections!
 Ideally something open source/free!

 We have a number of WAN links that will likely change, each requires a subnet. I know the number of links will be between 3 and 8 but don't know exactly how many we will have. At the same time I want to be efficient with our public address space.
 Is there a best practice for planning subnetting like this? One of our providers wants to know the IP address for an eBGP peering session but I don't want to commit with subnet info until I am sure.

I have realized by using https://config.office.com/ to manage build versions that some computers do not belong to us. 
 I guess the way is linked to our firm is by the tenant association key and by generating a new one and associating the right key to the software would be a solution. This seems to be a bit far fetched and I would like to simplify it. 
 On the section https://myaccount.microsoft.com/device-list it gives you the option to disable device. What does this exactly do? It cannot possibly disable the computer itself right?
 On the section https://portal.office.com/account#installs allows you to sign out from the device but of course the installation will remain there with the organizations tenant association key. 
 The goal being to remove the association of the software and our platform since it is not managed by us anymore, what are your thoughts?

 all the logs from the NPS windows server are being parsed through beats and store in an elastic cluster. i have gone through all the logs from the server but i can only see logs related to authentication clients.
 Microsoft documentation was no help at all and i was unable to find anything remotely useful on the internet.

 my predecessor barely documented anything, so the CEO wants me (only IT guy) to work 4d/week on documentation. One day is reserved for user problems.
 Anyways, when I was in school 6 months ago, we didn't really learn about documentation & my last place was a shitshow so there was never anything being documented.
 I'm trying my hardest in at least documenting anything (screenshots, colour coded words, full sentences with reason on why I did this etc.) but my boss really wants me to work like a project manager. 
 He showed me how they work on their annual statements (we are public) but how am I supposed to work exactly like that, when he has 5 people who went to University and have degrees in those things?
 Are there any tips or software I can use to help my process in being more efficient?
 I'm using yEd to construct a logical plan on how everything is connected etc, but it all takes so much time..
 Thanks for any help!!

Creating the account copying permissions, e-mail, licenses, software, phone, add to contact groups, etc.. and the exit, that sometimes de HR dep. don't notify in time, is also a running to keep data safe, block accesses, change shares passwords, etc..
 How do you "integrate" this processes with HR department and make this flow?
 Best regards, Good Monday!

 If we're getting into network automation shouldn't we be learning python anyways and want more flexibility?

 Working for IT at a fortune 100 company I always come across this dilemma: we use free and open source technologies all across the board to solve issues from data management to network automation. Sometimes I have even came across situations when, on my working hours, I need to solve issues and add functionality to free and open source software solutions.
 The thing is that, the company I work for is not a software company, we don't even have corporate GitHub or Gitlab accounts. So usually I just take note of what I did for a specific project and once I'm home, on my free time, I try to replicate it under my personal account.

 The hardware in questions is;
 Site A: USG PRO-4 Site B: Datto DNA device
 Datto user interface shows the tunnel as active and connected properly.
 I am able to ping each gateway from each site however I am not able to connect to any local network equipment.
 Site A subnet is 192.168.1.0/24 Site B subnet is 10.0.1.0/24

 Any suggestions on where to go from here? I figured enabling StS VPN topology would automatically open the necessary ports but maybe I’m wrong here and missing a rule?
 Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you in advance!

I already see managers try to get close to me positioning themselves to ask for some kind of rescue, which like I said I think there are very capable people out there but the management of the company I’m leaving is broken. Many ppl have left and many have been bought out to stay (in different depts) with big money. So it’s these ppl who are earning big money and trapped into this company that I feel will try to do anything in their power to reach me or have me “rescue” this place IT wise when I’m gone. One already “threatened” - “I’m still going to be calling you” this is one that kept calling nights weekends etc and giving insane amounts of work and bullying my boss to bully me to have things done at the snap of her finger. I know I will block and ignore but at the same time I don’t want to have these distractions when I’m going to be trying to start at a new job, thus thinking about changing my phone.
 What was your reasoning for the ones that did it?

 I was basically "guaranteed" a promotion 2 years in a row, but it didn't go through... again. It fell through the 2nd annual-review in a row. Now it "should be sometimes in the next few months... just waiting on paperwork to go through."
 last year, work load increased, then when the promotion failed, workload seemed to decrease. This year, was promised it again, my review was written well, even got a bonus. The raise though, is less than what inflation did to my paycheck (technically, I am making less regarding inflation).
 How much actual work within a company does it take to get promoted - from the upper-management side of things with paperwork and the final decision? I've usually trusted my manager pretty solid, and our communications has been pretty spot on for the many years I've worked with him, but starting to question things... . On the flip side, upper management seems to be constantly in a political battle with themselves over the past 2+ years. trying to get some feedback. Thanks.

In a pinch I've found it to be small, portable (goes in a pocket or wallet), very convenient when troubleshooting cross connects at a datacenter without constantly needing a light meter. The cost is steep at first for the F-IRC2-F (https://www.newport.com/p/F-IRC2-F) card I use, but is actually cheap when compared to their other cards (https://www.newport.com/f/near-infrared-nir-sensor-cards). It also works on CWDM + DWDM frequencies too.
 I hope this doesn't come off as a promoting a product persay, but wanted to show off a fantastic tool I've used for years, to my fellow colleagues.

 You know when you’re watching a movie and some hacker or hacker gang appears and they have some sort of « hacker lab » in an abandoned warehouse somewhere with a bunch of drops and equipment. 
 It always made me wonder as a sysadmin, how do you explain anonymity in such scenarios?
 Like I know it’s fiction and it’s all for show, but as a Sysadmin it kinda bothers me that I cannot explain to myself how such setup could be achieved without being tracked. 
 Like what, do they go up to an ISP and be like “Yo can I get a public IP for my edge router in that creepy abandoned warehouse so I can perform illegal online activities that law enforcement can track back to us through you?”
 Or do they hijack someone else’s line from the DMARC box of the ISP? 
 What are your theories on how such anonymous “hacker labs” can be achieved?

 I’ve been struggling to find a solid solution for reliable connectivity. We have on prem ERP and CAD software as well as file shares. 
 We are currently testing a China Telcom SD WAN solution. It gave us a modest increase in bandwidth (6M). I expected the latency to increase due to last mile hops. Latency went from 280ms to 300ms. The problem is that we still have more than acceptable packet loss. There are periods of 10-20% loss. China Telcom’s support has been unable to assist us with troubleshooting this packet loss. I’m close to pulling the POC and going back to the IP-SEC tunnel between our firewalls. 
 My goal is to provide stable connectivity. Any thoughts or suggestions would be very much appreciated. Thanks!

 Since I am starting from the scratch, I wanna build it so that it can scale with the growth of the company. So I am planning to host this on the web, so that in the future multiple admins can manage it. And also so that manager's can view/check their teams assets.I need to ensure all the integration's are setup like mail and slack as well.
 I am a noob at hosting things but I am happy to learn and try. Just wanted to know how I should go about this ?

 Long story short, I recently resigned from my IT director role. I'm fortunate to have some FU money saved up and I'm taking some time off before I take on my next role. In the meantime, I've been invited by a colleague to provide some guidance on the building out of tech services at a new facility in Zimbabwe. For me, it's a great opportunity to help an area of the world that may be lacking in IT expertise and I also love to travel.
 While I've been in IT for 25 years and have built many a network, server farm, office build out, etc. from scratch, I have no idea what specific challenges there might be around things like internet service, acquiring hardware and support, malware protection, and email.
 If there is anyone that might be up for a quick conversation, I would really appreciate it.

 I am 27 years old and I am working as a network administrator for 1 year at a pretty big ISP in Romania. Before that I worked for 4 years in technical support (networking) at the same company. My question is, what is the next step I should take after the network administration? I would love to learn cloud, but I have no experience in programming, and I have seen job postings that were pretty demanding. Do you have any other advices? What should I learn further? Python? AWS?I know 1 year in network administration is not much, but I am still learning and trying to become better at it.
 Thank you!

 I am quite new here and I hope the big reddit community can help me to find the best ERP for my new company ;)
 Let me start by introducing my work. I started a kind of trading company few months ago, focused on customized B2B products.
 I am based physically in China and manage orders for customers in Europe (as for now, always open to new business...) My main scope of business now is company gifts, meaning I have a lot of rather small orders, but many each week. My company is only few months old and I cannot afford a payable or customized ERP unfortunately, so I'm looking for a self-deployable ERP that could meet most of my requirements.
 Usually, I receive an inquiry from my client, "can you get 300 of these with custom logo ?". Then I make some sourcing if I don't already…]]></summary>

It integrates into Outlook with an addin and users currently have to manually archive emails into Deltek. Issue is, this system has constant issues (compatability, crashing, extremely slow and a bunch of orher issues with add unnecessary delays within a users day to day tasks.
 Can someone please recommend a solution?
 What we need is something that integrates into 365 seemlessly and all emails with all data (attachments) need to be searchable and easily accessible (preferably from within outlook.
 Ywars ago, another company i used to work at used Enterprise Vault. As my memory recalls, it was so seemless. All current and archived emails all show within outlook. You could double click on an archived email and as that email is opening, enterprise vault used to retrieve the data from the backend and present it as if its just another current email.
 I dont know of any other solutions or if Enterprise Vault is still worth it.
 All suggestions welcome.

Our anti-spam policy is, as of now, set to the weakest setting and unfortunately, we are not seeing any improvement by training the AI. There is no really help from Microsoft. The escalations we already made do not bring any solution. The want to sell us a high price support contract although we've evidence the spam detection respectively the AI is bad (much too agressive). We're in contact with another organisation they've been fighting with this behaviour since about 5 years. 
 Fun fact also serious mails from MS or other organisation/companys using EOP, MDO and Exchange Online are classified as spam.
 Has anybody similar experience like we?
 And found a way to tweak it?

 Just curious if any of you have any script of connecting remotely to a list of servers and executing Windows update? 
 I do have a script but this script obly works on the local machine but when i connect remotely to the same machine via Powershell, the script fails. 
 In my script, it references a list of servers in a text file and then it loops and execute command on one server at a time.
 Wondering if any of you have a similar script that works?
 Thanks in advance.

 When curl is told to use HTTP2 (curl --http2), Apache writes 2 lines in the access.log instead of the usual single line. Moreover, the date of the 1st line is completely wrong (sometimes even empty) and the protocol of 2nd line is HTTP/1.1 instead of the expected HTTP/2:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I have N different servers each serving it's own webapp. I want to put these servers behind a reverse proxy, but now I created a single point of failure: if my reverse proxy is going to fail I wont be able to access any of these webapps.
 ​
 Is it possible to scale my reverse proxies up to 2-3 machines? My guess would be to setup local DNS and keep DNS server monitoring for main rpxory status, then switch 'A' record to another rpoxy if it fails, but I don't know how to implement this switchover (if it's even possible) and now it seems that this local DNS is going to be SPOF, so...
 ​
 Q: Why do you want to use rproxy and/or local DNS?
 A: To ease maintenance of the system. I can quickly change which domain (or ip) points to which machine and it's port (in case of rproxy).
 ​
 (If exact products relevant to this problem, I would use nginx as rproxy and bind9 as local DNS)

 A high level description is enough as everyone is bound by confidentiality.
 It would be helpful if someone explains it to me :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have seen far too many "spot the phish" presentation that dissect a poor quality scam email, and point out the mistakes in it. 
 This is sending entirely the wrong message, because your users are now thinking that's how you detect scams. 
 When all that does is weed out the poor quality ones, and you make them more susceptible to the well crafted ones, because they think they know better. 
 But scammers aren't all careless. Most of the carelessness is deliberately filtering for victims already. 
 I have seen some very high quality spear-phishing attempts recently, that don't have "mistakes" in them. They have email addresses that look very plausible - sometimes spoofed, sometimes belonging to the .co.uk for a .com or similar.
 Occasionally coming from a personal email that looks like it could be a legitimate member of staff. Etc. 
 But elegantly crafted, personalised and a very plausible sort of request or warning. 
 The only way to spot these is to be skeptical about all of them. Don't rely on lazy scammers to be obvious about it, because that makes you vulnerable to the ones that aren't.
 If you want an analogy, then lets go with foraging for mushrooms. There's a load of varieties of mushrooms that are edible and very tasty. Some look a bit weird. https://www.wildfooduk.com/mushroom-guide/?mushroom_type=edible
 But if I describe to you Fly Agaric and you avoid that, it still doesn't make the Destroying Angel safe to eat!
 (Seriously - don't go foraging mushrooms unless you are VERY sure you recognise exactly which varieties are 'safe', and never ever eat one you're even slightly unsure about).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey community, 
 I wanted to start a discussion on network architecture. Specifically, I'm curious about your experiences with stacking in the Core layer. Do the networks you work on allow for this? What are the pros and cons you've encountered? 
 On one hand, there's the benefit of having a single management and reduced dependency on STP, bundling of links (ether channels), eliminating need for HSRP but on the other hand there are also the potential downsides such as a single point of failure and upgrades difficulty in software upgrade’s especially in critical operations environments where downtime is extremely difficult.
 Let's hear your thoughts and experiences!

 About a month into employment my boss found out I'm into homelabs and have the ability to take over their IT responsibilities from their MSP. Not my call.
 So I'm a bit wishy washy on whether they intend me to be their head of IT, be on-site for emergencies, answer support tickets, and plan, develop and migrate their core network and servers and all their licenses for 22/hr.
 Somethings not adding up.
 So I'm trying to make a list of everything that I'll be doing, see: https://pastebin.com/raw/zgr18M7Z
 What should I add to the bottom where my monthly fees should be and my responsibilities are? 
 I've never done a job like this and I think they're banking on me feeling I'll-confident so I don't ask for more pay but coursing me into doing the entire work of their MSP and handling the migration for what I think is not a 22/hr job

UDP traffic to/from Internet is usually blocked on corporate/school networks. Is it also disabled between devices on LAN i.e. two employee computers in office, or between computers in a university lab etc? 
 Seems like on corporate it usually isn't blocked, but not sure about schools/universities, seems like they go out of way to block a lot of stuff ie games, some voip apps etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, we have a very remote site with two DCs and a handful of workstations. Everything has been powered off and is now reaching the 180 day mark, so we expect it to be tombstoned when the equipment is all started back up.
 For logistical reasons there may not be a way to get personnel on site before the equipment needs to be powered back up, and it may be a PITA to resolve the AD issues remotely as the only means of access is via relatively slow satellite internet. It's doable but not fun at all. 
 Is it possible to "trick" the domain into avoiding the tombstone at powerup? Say for example, going into each machine at initial powerup before the OS is loaded and setting the BIOS clock back close to the last time the domain was live, and then moving the clock forward after all the machines have synced up? The machines will not have an external NTP time source initially so we don't expect that they will magically fix their clocks until we do it manually.
 Thanks!

 I’m currently a T2 support for about 6 years now. Our Sr sysadmin guy unexpectedly quit and now our our sysadmin guy moved up. As a T2 support, I handle SCCM stuff, MDM and escalation from our Tier 1s and very well in my comfort zone. 
 The new gig comes with a 8K paybump but probably stressful as heck especially during adjustment period for me. I took a peek at the sysadmin guy’s queue and I got terrified. Lots of unknowns and things that I wouldn’t have any clue how to do. Is this normal? I haven’t accepted the job yet as I told both my boss and his boss that I’ll be thinking about it over the weekend. 
 It took a lot from me to get to this expertise level to a point that I don’t even get stressed anymore since I’m very comfortable at doing this job. How did you guys made the jump? 
 When I first became a T2, I was stressed AF and lost some sleep. Me, being a young Dad l, with 2 young boys makes me want to turn down this opportunity. My spouse thinks I will absolutely kill this job once I get the hang of it.

We're looking at about 5 APs and using a cheap L2 POE switch to power and sort VLANs etc.
 Traditionally I'd suggest an Ubiquiti Unifi setup, as while the hardware costs are a bit higher you didn't need to worry about licencing going forward. However their licencing model seems to have changed, and while buying the APs with a 3-year licence isn't too expensive, it does raise questions as to what the costs will be for renewals.
 Can anyone suggest another managed wifi system I could look at and recommend? Budget is an issue otherwise Ruckus and Meraki would be on the table, but I want to avoid the really cheap and nasty solutions as the cost savings would be wiped out in maintenance/service calls

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year I started a new position with a relativity small IT team supporting a very complex and geographically diverse set of IT assets. It's been really frustrating since so many tools and processes which are common in most other IT organizations seems to be missing entirely from this one. 
 ​
  
No ticketing system
 No project management system
 No change management system
 No systems documentation or runbooks
 No systems monitoring tools
 No out of band management
 No system imaging solution
 No asset management solution
 No software deployment solution
 Inadequate data protection for core assets
 File shares residing on fast SSD storage but without snapshots
 VM's hosting databases running on slow HD storage
 Multiple instances of vSphere, each with their own VCSA, but with no HA clusters defined
 ESXi hosts all maxed out with no remaining capacity to vmotion anything off
 Electrically overloaded datacenters, PDU's, UPS's, etc.
 Most server hardware well past EOL
  
The list goes on an on. Each day I am discovering some new problem.
 While the IT manager admits some of this is problematic, we're in the process of building out yet more complexity without pausing to fix any of these underlying structural deficits. This leaves me wondering whether I should just toss in the towel and go look for another job.

 These are the people I don't feel guilty for calling after hours or when they're on PTO to ask basic questions because of the lack of documentation when something breaks.
 Are they even teaching documentation in schools? I don't remember ever being told to document or even how to document. 
 Even certs like A+, Net+, CCNA, or the few mcse courses I'm familiar with. None of them talk about the importance of documentation. The closest might be LAN/WAN diagrams or taking backups.
 My company even provides access to an online learning system and there are no specific courses on documentation or technical writing.
 Any time I work on or deploy a new system or software, there's usually a combination of three types of documentation I create; End User (if needed), information for the IT team to support/troubleshoot and personal notes (such as articles referenced during setup, steps to reproduce or other notes that wouldn't be beneficial to the team.)
 Even two or three sentences about something could save someone in the future time, headache and hassle.
 Most of the time, I don't create documentation for others - I create it for myself so I have something to reference in the future or can send to end users to minimize their need to reach out and bother me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All
 By deafult most switch and firewall don't have ACL to block Inter VLAN traffic.
 Is there a security need for this? 
 For example I split Data, VoIP and IoT in separate VLANs.
 They can't broadcast across VLANs however devices still can be pinged.
 Should I created ACL's to stop inter VLAN traffic?
 Let's say a VoIP phone was compromised it can't broadcast across VLANs. Is there still risk it can find way to other VLANs?
 Respect VLAN main goal is to reduce traffic and broadcast times on a network.
 Do you also use to to secure the network?

All other features are just a nice to have. Intune and SCCM are not an option. I know there’s Ninja One and Atera (among others). They seem to have what I’m looking for but I’d like to get opinions outside my head. What are your recommendations? Edit: thanks for the input folks. I appreciate your suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After all these years there has got to be a term or relevant XKCD about these kinds of folks. I'm sure many of us work with one, or have worked with one. 
 The person who intentionally sets things up in such a complicated way that only they know how to administer it, maybe to feel a sense of importance or job security? 
 We have an admin who refuses to use a windows computer and does everything via Mac, even though our environment is 99% windows. We have a small team of media relations people who use Mac for graphic design, video editing, and a few apps that are specific to Mac. This is around 3 people. 
 This same admin, when tasked with rebuilding a Windows 2012 file server, insists on using Linux/Samba because it "will probably play nicer with the Macs". This is 2023, I highly doubt a Mac can't connect to a Windows SMB share. At the same time, he also insists on running BIND DNS inside a FLAR container on Solaris, when he is the only one that knows Solaris - these boxes also haven't been patched in years and run insecure versions of BIND.
 What do you call these people? Does anyone else have similar stories?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm a new system administrator at a company that recently had a major server failure, and it was quite the experience. The server was hosting six production VMs, and due to a single PSU failure and motherboard issue(My finding), it completely failed. The worst part was that the previous system administrator had not backed up the critical databases.
 As the new guy, I was tasked with recovering the databases, and I was totally freaked out. I tried to recover the databases, but the server was unable to POST the ESXi, which made things even more challenging. After some trial and error, I decided to unmount the server from the rack and take it to my desk. I disassembled the server, removed the RAM, cleaned it with a vacuum, and rested it for over 10 hours.
 To my surprise, the hypervisor loaded successfully, and I was able to dump the six database files from one VM. However, the server suddenly went down, and I was unable to shift the dumped files. I tried again, and after a few attempts, the server worked for two hours before crashing again.
 At this point, I knew I had to act fast. I backed up everything and restored the system the next day, which was a challenging task, but I managed to get it done.
 I'm curious to hear about your experiences with server failures and database recovery. What are some of the worst cases you've encountered? And how did you handle them? Let's share our stories and learn from each other.

 Zero.
 I made a post of a while back on a different account about hating my manager. He manipulated and micromanaged me, spoke to me like crap, threw temper tantrums, screaming, the works. He'd give really excessive praise one minute and then absolutely rip you to shreds a few hours later. My mental health was seriously suffering. It wasn't uncommon for me to just get drunk alone after work to cope with his bullshit. I remain convinced he is narcissistic. 
 I followed the golden advice of this sub and got the fuck outta there (with a nice pay rise too!). Working my notice period didn't go quite to plan (they then started to target me specifically, even in front of HR) so I just said fuck it and never went back.
 I am SO much happier in my new job. Is there fuck tonnes to do? Yes. Does my manager want updates on every little thing and start screaming at me the second he misunderstands something? Nope. He is so chilled. I don't think this guy has ever stressed about anything in his life. 
 Apologies for the client click bait title. I guess all I wanted to share was that if you're unhappy, just leave. Despite the "impending recession", the IT market is still going strong. Thank you guys, I love this community.

 With the refresh, I am entertaining the idea of segmenting traffic at the Fortigate, or it being the new gateway. 
 Can the firewall handle that type of traffic? How would that topology look?

The customer is interested in a RDS load balancing option that will consider CPU/RAM utilization on the session hosts in determining which server to put a new connection on. The built-in load balancing that the RDS gateway does is basically only number of users, with no consideration around metrics. It looks like there are a few third party apps that do this. Does anyone have a recommendation around this, and most importantly - can it be added on top of an existing RDS deployment? We're not interested in rebuilding things if we can avoid it. Thank you!

 We're willing to do it, but seeing as they'd be going up onto what seems like an already very well established firmware train, it's going to be a lot of reading of release notes to try and understand if anything might break and what's actually changing between the major versions.

 ​
 I'm helping out a local charity with some of their IT stuff, a part of this is to move the infrastructure to the cloud to enable better remote working.
 Whilst cloud infrastructure is my bread and butter - Local networking is not a strong suit and I'm struggling to find a suitable solution.
 My aim is to have the users VPN into the office (In a tunnel all mode kind of mode), and for the cloud resources to then be reachable that way.
 The charity does not have any real onsite networking gear besides an old Technicolor Router, so I'm wanting to put in place a low-cost hardware solution for a VPN that users can connect to from their laptops. I've done this previously with Sonicwalls, but fear that these might be out of budget. Is there a good low-cost alternative?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to find a solution to replace our numerous scheduled robocopy batch jobs on multiple computers.
 The most common configuration is weekly, daily or on demand copy of files from one or up to three directories to a SMB share. It's currently deployed on ~100 computers which are in an isolated network which has no access to the internet or any cloud services.
 Goals I'd like to accomplish are
  
some kind of monigoring to keep track if a planned copy job failed, didn't start or didn't finish i.e. client was turned off, client couldn't reach the network etc.
 (optionally) some kind of dashboard
 easy to deploy and configure for our first line
 possible to run with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account
  
Couple of products I reviewed either:
  
reliead on java (too many problems if a client relieas on a different version of java, also a resource hog),
 cloud (not acceptable security-wise),
 relied on a dedicated server as a worker (bottlenetck).
  
This is a last resort question before I start to design my own solution. Any input appreciated!

 Visited again 2 years ago and it was garbage.
 Visited just now and it still requires considerable amount of time troubleshooting.
 I have device targeted apps in Intune across alot of SMB clients working no problem, so the enrollment process is working as a prerequisite to Autopilot, just fine.
 First Autopilot throws a 0x81036502 app error. Attempting to pull MDM Logs from Autopilot GUI on client throws an 0x800700 Access Denied error.
 Attempting to dump the logs on c:\ through cmd fails with same error, ok fine MS says cannot dump on root.
 Tries to dump on USB stick and then again all new 0x000000 error.
 .... Autopilot still total garbage.
 At this point its still more reliable to enroll with an install/demo user, hand to client and change primary user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys, I’ve a client who sent me a picture of a device testing ports, to demonstrate the ports were not functioning correctly. The device appears to be testing PoE, but for the block of 12 ports all at once, instead of just one. I’ve asked them for info but they have no idea (or willingness to check) who made it or the model etc.
 So, does anyone happen to know about these types of devices, or what this is called? Or something that achieves the same thing? I’ve searched and searched, but only find single port testers. My team has the need to test PoE on switches, often times several dozen, so a device that tests multiple ports like this would be really useful. Thank you!

 A few months ago at my job, I managed to transfer 5PB of data across continents with just these tools tools - rsync, gnu parallel, tmux and gdu. Had to use these tools because the environments didnt allow to install any other ones. This was my first time doing a transfer of such a scale with such tight constraints on tools and managed to complete it in approx. 3 months. Given this information, I wanted to know what the wider market thinks of this. How much would you give this effort out of 10? Or on a scale of (1) I'd hire you for triple the pay (2) Ok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a late night of dealing with this issue. We had a notice in one of our old R720 that a drive in the RAID10 went offline. I went out and replaced it like normal. The system is setup with C: as the OS and D: as has the Hyper-V files.
 Typically, a rebuild for this array takes about 12 hours. Right now, it's estimating 12 days! The odd thing is, the entire system has slowed to a crawl. Any IO on C: or D: brings the system to a crawl. Programs lock up for a few minutes.
 Looking at the event logs, and I'm getting a bunch of the following events:
  
Event 9, Hyper-V-StorageVSP - An I/O request for device 'C:\Virtual Hard Disks\XXXX.vhdx' took 10675 milliseconds to complete. Operation code = READ16, Data transfer length = 4096, Status = SRB_STATUS_SUCCESS. We are getting this error for both C and D drives.
 
Event 129, percsas2i - Reset to device, \Device\RaidPort0, was issued.
 
 We also use VeeamOne and are getting disk latency alarms for both drives.
 I am able to export the VMs across the network to a different system without any issues.
 At this point, I'm thinking maybe a raid controller or backplane issue. Any thoughts? I'm super tried so pardon my if my post didn't make sense.
 Notes: Yes, I know the R720 is ancient. Everything on it is backed up and safe.

 At a loss and need some help.
 We are a small/medium sized business. 70ish people. Have a Watchguard Router and Unifi AP's/Switches.
 Ran into an issue last week where our 16-XG died. Would keep shutting off randomly. Couldn't find one available immediately, so had to reroute the cables to a different switch on the rack while we found a replacement.
 Got a USW-Pro-Aggregation to replace it.
 Switched everything to the new one, thought we were all in the clear.
 Started getting emails around 11/11:15 at night that VPN/network was down. Reboot the Watchguard and everything is back up and running. Get the same messages in the morning around 6:30/7 pm. Watchguard reboot fixes it again.
 More of the same all week, thought I might've plugged a cable in wrong somewhere, and that was causing issues. Gone over all of them, and everything looks to be fine. Thought maybe our backups were causing the issue, since they run at around 11pm at night, kinda made sense.
 Turned off Backups last night, same thing happened.
 Turned them back on tonight, and same thing happened.
 In the Unifi Console, the amount of clients on certain switches doubles. The switches at times show a Down speed of 79641 Mbps, but average 300-1000Mbps. Clients also show a huge download. But on the PC's I can't see anything being downloaded. Looks like there's a ton of traffic from the backups using Wireshark. But my knowledge of Wireshark is very limited.
 The only way to get things going again is by rebooting the Watchguard, or one of the network switches.
 Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because of this thread, I brought it up with my therapist and was just diagnosed conditionally as inattentive ADHD at a late age. I have another appointment with a doctor that is going to go through some things with me to give me a "second opinion" on my conditional diagnosis.
 A month ago when the post was first put out there I read it in full, comments and all, and almost everything that people were putting out there seemed to jive with how I am. 
 I dive deep into MANY MANY things/hobbies I'm interested, I misplace things easily, I jump from topic to topic, or task to task at work, and many other things that jived with the post/comments.
 My therapist also explained that many folks who undergo many stressors during a young age, like I was brought up, don't usually get diagnosed with ADHD. Their brains bar for stress is much higher and it's usually chalked up to that. 
 I want to thank /u/sobrique for bringing this topic up and leading me down an enlightening path. 
 I have recently seen on reddit posts after the above post that ADHD is very heavily linked to alcoholism and I with alcoholism. I don't drink during the day( or even think about drinking alcohol), and only at night a little too much and things have become unmanageable with relationships in my life. I have been seeking help with alcoholism for quite some time, I had a long hiatus from alcohol and fell back in recently after some stressful situations. I am hoping that this diagnosis, with a coupled medication(dopamine levels normalizing, and not partaking), can help me get off of alcohol and get the old me back. 
 I have blathered on too long and need to go to bed now. I thank you all for being you and reading my post. Their is hope in this world and I love you all. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, i have a consideration of building a network for data center.. It'll only be for IoT devices that's related to the dc operational needs, like cctv, electrical or temp sensor, etc. There will be 5 floors, and approximately around 17 thousands of ip or endpoints will be used.
 So i'm considering using vxlan for the sake of IP efficiency and broadcast storm prevention, since there'll be 5 floor and the switches will be put everywhere.
 Is there a best way to do the segmentation? Considering using a /17 subnet in one vlan, i'm a bit afraid of the domain failure. If I use dedicated / different vlan for each floor (by floor vlan segmentation), i can't see the benefit of the vxlan is utilized. (And also, i think there'll be unused ip since the allocated subnet can't be used in different floor) If I use dedicated / different vlan for each specific IoT category, i'm considering about the dailyops, since there'll be no thing such as ISE or ClearPass in place..
 Any advise / suggestion will be much appreciated, thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am being asked to get a small business HIPAA compliant. I do M365 setups and administration all of the time and I understand how to enable MFA, legal holds, transport rules, etc. just fine. But even after spending the last half hour on google I can't seem to find anything that actually spells out what makes a M365 tenant HIPAA compliant. Everything is just a damn advertisement or article that eventually ends in "Get a free consultation with XYZ" and I'm like... I know how to do all of the things individually, I just need to know what rules need to be followed so I can put the darn controls in place.
 Is there somewhere I can read the exact requirements/guidelines? Thanks folks

 What sort of equipment can I use to tie this into network? I would like to use 1gbps for now and upgrade to 5g or 10g in the future if possible.
 I currently have HPE switches. I know you get SFP module I am just unsure about the exact specs needed. 
 Also should the terminations be SC or LC?

 Edge was actually a decent alternative to Chrome for a bit but they continue to add so much ridiculous bloat to it that it's a joke now and I'm convinced whoever is in charge of that team is on drugs. The list of things I have to disable on Edge via GPO was already huge.

 I'm newer here and we are a 2 man IT dept that will expect to blow up from 40 or so to nearly 200 total users.
 All we do is cloud based nothing on prem (fyi).
 That said, I want to search for an easy to use ticketing system that we can learn to configure and have our users to use it to submit tickets instead of hitting us up on teams or calls. My goal is to streamline support so this casual walk-up stops and folks submit a ticket.
 Also this ticketing system needs to be hosted by them, as we so not have servers on prem. 
 I have used service desk by manage engine, service now but never as an admin of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bit of an issue, and I am by no means a networking expert, so please be gentle....
 I have 11 sites, interconnected with Prisma ION-1000 SD-WAN devices. Most of the sites have 2 ISP connections. We have been using DHCP on most of the Verizon boxes we use, but have run into issues of connectivity between several of the sites. This week, they replaced the ION device at one of our locations, and we additionally asked Verizon for a static IP for the location. They assigned the IP to the wireless box and provided us with the info. As I was digging into the settings and info today, I realized that the IP they had assigned to us is the IP of the Default Gateway of one of our other devices. I remember seeing this previously, when configuring 4 other Verizon devices for distribution to locations, and thought it odd. The new device has connectivity issues, and I am unsure how to fix the problem, or if this is even possible, in this configuration? Am I missing something, or can I configure something specifically to alleviate the problem? Thank you, in advance.

 I looked at documentation from the recipient's DNS (mx1.privateemail.com) and also Google, and my basic knowledge isn't helping. The recipient's documentation suggests Google rejected this message, but I'd normally see this the other way around, where the recipient rejected it.
 Did the recipient's server reject this due to a high probably of spam? Or did Google reject this and it not send it because there was a high probability of it being spam?

 ​
 I have a strange behavior on my company network and after many hours, I can't understand or find any logic.VLAN's are configured on Fortigate 80F firewall (VLAN ID24 for guest network, on 10.4.24.0/24 with 10.4.24.200 GW) and I've tagged the VLAN ID 24 on my Netgear S3300 switch.
 When I connect through wired cable a Windows 10 laptop, everything is fine. My client received an IP from DHCP delivered by the firewall, I get my IP, gateway, mask, DNS... and I can get outside through my gateway normally
 But when I connect a laptop with a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Centos or a device with a Linux kernel), I get an IP from DHCP but I can't go outside and I can't ping my gateway.
 I've tried with 3 linux (live usb boot) differents, same behavior.
 I've verified the routes and eveything seems to set correctly
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 0.0.0.0; 10.4.24.200; 0.0.0.0; UG 20100 0 0 enp2s0
 10.4.24.0; 0.0.0.0; 255.255.255.0 U 100 0 0 enp2s0
 ​
 If some kind soul could help me to understand what is going on :)

 Rack Allotment: https://i.ibb.co/VBQRw3X/Screenshot-39.png
 Racks are connected with 10Gb/s OM4 fiber optics cables.Asking ourselves how many routers we should plan.We thought about just one firewall router, configured in high availability mode (if one fails, the second one kicks in). So, just one router at time which will be providing both LAN routing and LAN to WAN routing.
 Assuming a VAR who specialises in networks planning, is working on this, do you see any weak points in this scheme? Any comment is highly appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 Recently got into this weird issue.
 My Macbook M2 cannot seem to connect to certain private IPs using certain protocols (as stated in the title). Let's say the private IPs are all in the range of 192.168.0.0/16, my Macbook is in 10.0.1.0/24
 - I can connect to some hosts in 192.168.12.0/24, by their open ports/listening services (say HTTPS)
 - I cannot connect to other hosts in 192.168.13.0/24, by their open ports/listening services. Even telnet to ports do not return anything (which seemed like an indicator of a firewall in between)
 - However, there are no firewalls or access lists in between my Macbook and the destinations - I confirm this since this is the network that I manage and own, and there have been no anomalies detected. No routing configuration changed.
 - I can ping/traceroute using ICMP to the hosts
 - Another colleague's Macbook, in the same source as 10.0.1.0/24 can connect to mentioned host without problems
 - I have done tcpdump with the following commands, which return no packets if the traffic belongs to one of the affected flow (say the host I'm trying to connect to is 192.168.13.13)
 sudo tcpdump -nnvv host 192.168.13.13 0 packets captured 0 packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel 
 - For a certain Window DNS server in 192.168.13.0/24, I can use it to resolve the DNS queries (via dig). I cannot, however, connect to it via RDP (while I was able to just one week ago). Tcpdump displayed DNS requests/responses, ICMP requests/replies, but no RDP traffic even coming out of the Macbook
 ​
 This has recently happened. I'm currently on Ventura 13.2.1
 ​
 Please assist me in this case. This subreddit does not allow crossposting from r/macbook, so this would be a duplicate thread :)
 ​
 P.s: I have also restarted my Macbook a few times. Not gonna work with such trick

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thought I would post this in case others haven’t thought to leverage Connectwise to install the Office update for CVE-2023-23397. We have 700 on premise domain joined Windows 10 machines in offices and remote/home locations. Moving to Intune soon but not there yet.
 Here's what we have done making it a breeze:
  
Notified staff that any MS Office applications left open on the screen would shut down @ 11:00 when we sent the command.
 WOL all office based devices
 Highlighted all machines in Connectwise and sent the command below
  
"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\OfficeC2RClient.exe" /update user displaylevel=false forceappshutdown=true 
  
Any machines online updated there and then including machines not logged into.
 For the 300 or so machines not turned on, as and when they have been coming online, they have checked in with Connectwise and the original queued command has then run updating office.
  
Along with using https://config.office.com/ to track progress, In Connectwise we have also used a custom property to store the office version/build and then scope a session group to this to keep track of unpatched versions.
 Command for Custom Property: 
 Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty VersionToReport 
 Session Group – Subgroup expression (remember to update refresh custom properties):
 IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*16130.20306', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*16026.20238', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*15928.20298', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*15601.20578', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*14931.20944', 'PATCHED', 'NOT PATCHED')))))

 I was reviewing Microsoft Defenders 'Experts on Demand' costings, and have seen this has now been rebranded to Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting.
 After talking to the Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting team, it seems we're not eligible for a few reasons.
 So my question, does anyone have any alternatives to the 'Microsoft Defender Experts on Demand' option, to support our Microsoft Defender environment in for any scenarios where incidents are too advanced for our inhouse IT.
 I am not looking for an alternative to 'Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting', just the 'Microsoft Defender Experts on Demand' option.
 Kind Regards,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I'm the developer and owner of a web application that's grown in popularity (and so visibility) over the past few years. In the last month or so, this has brought something new our way with a series of what I'm quite certain are DDoS attacks. Nothing that would crash Facebook, but HTTP requests for our landing and login pages at a rate of ~1000/second without follow-up for the page's resources. Attacks are happening maybe a few times a week.
 I've been building an IP blacklist from the points of origin, am rate-limiting these pages by IP, and have split login onto its own server, so that when these pages get flooded most of our users are not impacted. All of that has done a lot to mitigate the effects of these attacks.
 What's the long-term game, though? Should I be concerned that we're seeing regular attacks, or is this just a product of seeing more traffic? Are there other measures I should be taking? Can I be a better citizen of the internet by reporting points of origin to somewhere?
 Thank you so much for your thoughts on this!

When I have the time, I will go through and try and clean up cables and get everything looking nice and neat, but I find it very frustrating since it seems like I keep making shortsighted decisions that I have to fix later on. 
 I used to have a similar problem to this back when I did more development work. I would struggle with naming classes and variables, but I eventually learned that using standards and good principles helped me get past those issues. Is there some sort of equivalent for server racks? It feels like an odd question but, I'm running out of ideas here... I'm also getting tired of having to unplug a bunch of stuff before I can slide a server out for maintenance.
 To provide some context I'm mostly dealing with Poweredge servers, with a few other oneoff devices mixed in.

 We are using Intune and will in many cases set up a laptop locally and ship it to the user.
 Currently the computers are just deployed with English US. But many locations need different timezones.
  
 Is there any way to automatically update the timezone and regional settings based on the location of the device? We would very much like to keep the display language in English.

 The only thing from MS I've found is to just update the client, for users with findings are you guys resetting passwords as well? Just looking for more guidance.

 Users have been emailing external people and some have started coming back saying there is a PNG on the email. 
 This PNG is a blank 1x1 attachement with a file name like: 
 0e79bd18-2e8b-470a-bd12-bab865673dc1
 Ive had the same user email me and my external email address and this attachment has been missing from both the emails. 
 It looks like its present on an email that was only sent internally but un-sure if something may of been forwarded in that body and then edited out. 
 We have exclaimer which im edging towards being the problems but my knowledge with this system isn't the greatest. Just wondering what other idea people have as to what it may be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have PingID for SSO and MFA and have our M365/Azure authenticate through it. Here recently we've had some key users get locked out of AD constantly. This is because the authentication requests go to our DC to authenticate each SSO authentication, and because it's a brute force attempt, it's constantly locking out those users. 
 I reached out on multiple occasions to PingID and they dismissed it as "non issue" or pointed the finger back at us. I finally got some escalation and was taken semi-seriously at pointing out this issue (exploit??) and here was there recommendation: "Turn off AD lockout" What? So remove a security measure to open up an even bigger risk? Let them brute force the crap out of each user until they get the correct password, then move on to the next steps? Why would we give them that ability? We've asked Ping to provide logs of where the attacks are coming from, IP's, location, something. They refuse to give any. Their dashboard doesn't provide logs because they never (yet) have made it past the first authentication factor. It only logs on second factor.
 Ping recommends buying another product (Ping Federate) to solve this issue, but has not provided any details on how that fixes the issue. We also don't feel we should have to purchase more products from them to fix "their" issue.
 Here's where I'm stuck. Azure shows no logs. Purchased Azure AD P2 hoping that would help. No change in Azure AD logs. Nothing showing where the authentication attempts are coming from. Tried various geolocation and IP reputation blocks on Ping, nothing because it doesn't block until second factor. What else could be do to stop the AD Lockouts without "turning off AD Lockout" as Ping carelessly suggested? Anyone else experience this with PingID, or another provider?

 Within Intune > Devices > Windows, on the "OS Version" filter, everything displays "10.0.1xxx" or "10.0.2xxx" I'd have assumed that it would show "11.0.0" or something similar for a Win 11 machine, unless I'm mistaken?
 It might be worth noting, our current Windows 11 machines were upgraded from Windows 10, not Windows 11 out of the box.
 Appreciate the help! :) And again, apologies if I'm potentially being silly at all here.

 I’ve been experimenting with application recognition and finding it a bit hit and miss. For example, google Remote Desktop seems cannot be recognised with 4.5.0 along with many others that are listed. In the old days anything with application awareness needed to be updated fairly regularly to stay up to date with application signatures. Is this a reason to run a pretty current software release? Not sure how good VMware SD-Wan is at application awareness but would have thought pretty good ?

 ​
 I wanted to get some long term real live usage feedback from you, since it's hard to find not sponsored and not auto generated reviews nowadays.
 ​
 I already use a password manager for my private day to day logins, so It's easier to remember the master pwd than all the ssh keys, and other tokens and logins. I have to switch often between systems, and to have to spin everything up is a pain, and keys/tokens in a set up script is an absolute no go. Being able to have access to all the keys from the console seems grate.

 I use keeper as my private pwd manager and I'm happy with it, but 1password seems attractive too.
 What are your takes regarding these two?
 Maybe you all have another suggestion?
 Or another good solution?

 - simple commands and quick access to the basic functionalities (I don't need to manage it through the console, i just want to access)
 - my sysadmin at work should be happy
 - mobile app and browser extension (if on the go or having to access smthng through the browser)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 ​
 I'm trying to extend the visibility of teams calendars (before judgement is passed, we are a small business and everyone is fine sharing calendars, consents are signed and filed). So we have manager's team, where MD is the top manager and I can view all people directly reporting to him within the list of those calendars, but how do i include sub-managers team's into it as well? 
 Also, how do i enable employee reporting to sub-manager's to be able to view to full team as well? 
 I was hoping it was achievable through "manager's team calendar" as it's autodiscovery kind of feature without any setup for the users, rather than manually sharing or setting each mailbox to reviewer etc. 
 ​
 Any guidance appreciated, many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if similar cases have been asked before, but here's the situation:
 We have IOT devices out on the field, and these devices are hooked up to modems. These modems have generic 4G SIM cards in them. The IOT devices use this public 4G connectivity to push data to an FTP server unsecurely. CTO wants to change this. CTO wants to put the FTP server behind a private subnetwork, and he wants to have the 4G SIM modems connect to a VPN with a peering to the private subnetwork with the aforementioned FTP server.
 Here's the thing: I'm not sure how this works. The usage of 4G SIM cards means that the IP address is dynamic or keeps changing. Furthermore, the modem only supports some old L2TP/IPSEC protocol. As the CTO wants this to be on Azure, I've read about Azure Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site, but I don't know how to relate this back to these modems.
 Does anyone know how this is accomplished?
 The traffic goes from public 4G to VPN Client to Azure VPN Gateway subnet to private network with the FTP server.

 The Issue: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/ldap-troubleshooting/
 For this setup im using windows 11 home edition and kali linux but for some reason i keep getting the server 91 error. I've tried more than 7 types of configurations scenarios - which have all failed.
 Collector won't see or collect information through LDAP query 
 Clearly I'm missing something that i am not aware of...
 If someone can point me in the right direction i will be eternally grateful:

 I'm currently trying to configure a new Microsoft hosted mail-adress linked to our heating-system to the alarm-smtp-service, but because of its age, I guess it still uses port 465 for smtp, now I can't find a way to send it and there is no extra slot to configure the port. Whenever I use the Powershell SMTP for testing on ports 25 and 587 it works like a charm, 465 doesn't go through at all.
 Is there a workaround for this, or should I just use an external mail-provider for that?
 If I didn't elaborate enough, please just tell me, maybe I can provide more info :)

 The issue we have is that the networks IP addresses are stored in some Excel files which are :
  
Difficult to update
 A PITA to use to add any more info than the name and IP of the device
  
I'm looking for a better solution, I tried netbox but it seems to be overkill and too much tailored to DC usage which we aren't. We do already have some of our equipements mapped using DNS names and reverse PTR in our DNS (which I also needs to migrate from a 15+ y/o server) which are monitored using zabbix. But Zabbix is only a monitoring tools, not a network mapping/inventoring one. My boss/coworker also tried at some point using Mediawiki, but the issue remains it's a PITA to maintain.
 So, fellow sysadmins, what do you recommend to replace those old Excel files ?

 Why is the client not using the secondary DNS? It's all right setup on the NIC configuration

 What I have collected so far:
  
Ubiquiti is a few steps below professional grade brands, as a whole
 Aruba series gets a lot of fans and seems to be a good overall solution
 Juniper Mist APs growing strong
 FortiXXX strong on firewalls, weaker on switching
  
This brings me to these ideas:
  
Use Fortigate for firewalling
 Use one-brand setup for switching, to keep things easier to manage
  
At this stage, I miss some thoughts about Juniper switches..... Is there any user who has an experience with these devices?

 I was contacted by a company recently for a job that looks quite neat.
 As I looked into the company I found out it is a (huge) debt collection agency. If they collected debts only from companies I'd probably be fine.
 But they also collect from the normal day to day person, say some poor sod just getting behind on bills due to unfortunate circumstances ending up collection horrible interest rates and something that was a couple hundred ends up in the thousands. I'd sort of be making money from making people miserable. Call me a bleeding heart or whatever, but that's the way it is.
 So I decided that just wouldn't fly with me.
 I've worked with things that may be considered unethical as well, legal intercept amongst others, but all I ever heard were people conspiring on fraud of various kinds. I was fine with that.
 So, boiled down, I wonder if anyone else ever said no to a job due to the product the company offers?

 I’ve been hired as a network engineer somehow and they want to build a new DC. My boss is requesting my input on having perimeter and internal (local network facing) firewalls. However as per my understanding, the main idea of that is for the DMZ, and we don’t have any need for it currently since all of our public services are in the cloud. Is having 4 firewalls worth it in that case? Are there any other use cases?
 ISP ——> Perimeter FW ——> DMZ ——> Internal FW ——> Network 
 Right now we purchased 2 Fortigate firewalls for the perimeter, and we’re thinking of adding 2 Palo Alto FW’s.

 I haven’t taken any classes in probably 15 years because I learn best by doing not trying to ingest knowledge with no application, and I’m finding the whole experience to be less than optimal; jumping between three different environments breaks concentration, videos aren’t conducive to skipping back to review info, and I don’t feel I’m learning anything. I have two big monitors on my desk, which should be enough space for all this but it still feels inefficient. 
 My boss tells me I should take more classes when (if? Lol) I complete this one, but quite frankly, if this is the new normal for online learning it sucks.

 This may be old news, but I logged onto a dozen different clients and they did not have it turned on, so I guess not a lot of people know about it.

 Designed by day. Ex Monday, Tuesday #1 / Wednesday, Thursday #2 / Friday and weekend (in case of major emergency or major patch) #3
 4 off and rotate so everyone has a week off at some point.
 Half week #1 and #2 then #3 and #4
 Any other suggestions and what would be the best in your opinion? 
 Take good care guys,
 Edit because I realized some crucial information was missing.
 The production is running 24/5 but our team is working 8-5 with 1 hour lunch break abd 15 min break AM/PM. Our team don't really need to be on premises 24/7.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 We're mainly Macs (managed by Mac only MDM), but have a handful of Win devices that aren't managed atm. Normally I'd go straight to Intune, but since our org doesn't run on M365 (Apps for biz is the highest we go), Intune isn't the best option price wise. So looking for recommendations for other Win MDMs.
  
Hexnode looks interesting, and is cheaper than Intune.
 Scalefusion is a hard no due to their sales tactics.
 Managengine is a no due to some reviews in this sub...plus it's more expensive than Intune.

 Even when you manually update the definitions to the latest, the older versions still show as needed in the WSUS console instead of disappearing as superseded. 
 Is there a fix for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am attempting to host a Windows shared drive across a StS VPN. Below is the network configuration along with IPs. I am also pretty new to this so go easy on me lol
 ​
 Site 1 - Where Shared Drive will be hosted. 
 USG Pro4 - 
 Server Address: 76.XXX.XX.XX
 Shared Remote Subnets: 10.0.5.0/24
 Remote IP 108.XX.XX.XXX
 Key Exchange Version: IKEv2
 Encryption: AES-256
 Hash: SHA1
 DH Group: 14 
 Options for PFS and Route Based VPN checked, Route distance "30"
 ___
 Site 2 - Needs access to Shared Drive 
 Datto DNA Appliance 
 Local Ispec ID: 108.XX.XX.XXX (Same as "Remote IP")
 Remote ISpec ID: 76.XXX.XX.XX (Same as "Server Address from Site-1) 
 Remote Subnets: 192.168.1.0/24
 IKE Mode: IKEv2
 Encryption Algorithm: AES-256
 Hash: SHA1
 DH Group: Group 14: 2048 bit
 (Option for "Dynamic Phase 2" disabled, Dead Peer Detection Enabled)
 ​
 With this current configuration I can ping the gateway of Site 2 from Site 1 but I cannot ping vice versa and I am starting to get frustrated. It's confusing as there are multiple differences in language between the options. 
 Perhaps there is a better option?
 Any ideas would be greatly and thoroughly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently implemented some ties between a small number of racks in a DC using FS 24 fibre MTP polarity solution. We used all SMOF components (standardising on SMOF in the DC) consisting of: 24F Type A Cassette <> 24F Type A trunk cable <> 24F Type AF Cassette. This works and allows standard A-B patch cables on either end when patching. Essentially Port 1 maps to Port 2 on the remote cassette (rolling the fibre). However, there was a bit of confusion during installation as each A cassette had to match with an AF.
  
I understand polarity with the 3 solutions for MTP-12 (Method A, B, C). Are these exactly the same for MTP-24? 
 Could we have achieved the same result using 2x 24F Type A cassettes, and a 24F Type C trunk cable in between? 
 What are others doing for inter-rack patching in the DC - sticking with straight-through 1-1 polarity (A/A/A solution) and using A-A patch cables on one end, or using the inter-rack MTP to roll the fibre (either with a A/A/AF or A/C/A solution)?
  
I'm also looking to break out some 400G and 100G ports to 4x100G and 4x10G respectively.
 My understanding is I would use a QDD-4X100G-LR-S or QSFP-4X10G-LR-S connecting to a 3 x 8F MTP cassette (each cassette could break out 3 ports from the switch) using a MTP-12 Type A trunk cable. Is this the best way of breaking out ports to 4x standard duplex LC connectors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow Sysadmins I need a laugh this week. I’m currently interviewing for a full time remote job. Got to the final round of a MSP and when I mentioned tech stacks they begrudgingly admitted their customers are heavy ibm legacy Java enterprise web applications users and the ticketing system is BMC remedy from 2009. 
 These systems have caused so much grief over the years I simply could not imagine working on them full time. The amount of security advisories alone can send your teams mental state to oblivion. 
 I felt bad turning them down but the hiring manager was very professional about it. Even mentioned hiring staff was becoming increasingly difficult as young or old hires are well aware these products reputation precedes them. The support teams are anemic and on a month to month biases vulnerabilities could pile higher than a dung beetle rolling shit. Anyone else have a vendor they simply won’t work anymore, with would love to hear why humorous or not.
