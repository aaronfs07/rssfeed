        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our main infrastructure uses Aruba CX 6x00 serie switch and we manage everything with SSH and CLI. We really love them and have no issue so far.
 I have to setup a few temporary remote branches, but I don't have the budget for aruba switches.
 The remote branches would each be about MAX 10 workstations with a 10GB single mode fiber uplink, so a single 16 port switch should be enough.
 Can you recommend a low cost solution (<500$) for a 16 port switch with 10GB uplink that would be manageable with CLI(SSH) (we only need layer 2 for VLAN and MSTP). No power redundancy is required. And most importantly, that would have no issue with the Aruba uplink? I know it should be industry standard, but I've been bitten a lot of times by low cost solutions in the past, and I prefer not to lose time.
 I found the D-Link DGS-1510 line, but I have no idea what it is worth management wide, as I never touched anything else than main vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Arista and HPE/Aruba).
 The aruba uplink is a 6300 (JL658A). I don't have the SFP modules yet. Fiber is single mode OS2.

 From time to time I have to make an IT presentation for 10-20 people with several labs - task - in between 
 And it’s kinda always pain in the a.. to see when the majority of people have finished there tasks..
 Is there maybe a simple webpage with a tool where I could share a link - and if someone is finished his task he can click - I am ready- and I could see it? After everyone is finished - I could reset it for all.

 Currently I want to expand my market worth and just knowledge in different areas. At work my permissions are restricted somewhat, we are an international company and even though my department operates without the complete oversight of our mother branch, permissions are restricted which is normal.
 I am looking at getting the dev program licence for 365 so I can actually evaluate the entirety of it and get the full picture. I am an admin in the majority of areas but can’t go running around Willy nilly and start playing with global settings. 
 Currently I am looking at getting docker, vmware (the backend stuff I don’t understand) and maybe centOS so I can learn Linux a bit more and of course my own 365 tenant.
 Do you peeps have any suggestions on sought after platforms and what free resources they have? Or an insight on “what’s the next big thing”? 
 Any and all suggestions are appreciated!
 P.S my work does fund training but that is already being used in more network related areas.

 Can the NO_PROXY variable be used to circumvent this like `NO_PROXY=https://saas.com\` 
 If yes then once NO_PROXY is set which software is it used by? 
 is my app that is making the requests supposed to read this env var and set something special in the request so that it goes through without the forward proxy
 ​
 or is it supposed to be read by forward proxy so that it acts like a sort of allow list in the forward proxy and lets the request from my app pass through to the internet?

 The meraki switches cannot act as a dhcp so my solution was to setup a windows server vm which would act as the dhcp server for all sites they would connect to this vm with site to site vpn’s.
 Then I would setup L3 routing and interfaces on the switch and relay the request to the VM. Is this possible or am I way off the mark any help or pointers is greatly appreciated.

 Google Store TOS says 10 devices of a model per account before you get banned, Android's EMM directory of resellers have shot us down for low volume (they wanted an initial order in the thousands, which we don't need). At this point I'm even willing to forego EMM + zero-touch enrollment, simply because we need devices.

 ​
 I work for a small MSP and one of the roles i have is to do an inventory of customers equipment. As it is now, i have an excel sheet that i go to the customer's site, and go through each computer, 1 by 1, noting down the system specs and info (like serial # and IP address) on each computer, then i move on to network devices like printers, switches, routers, APs, etc.
 Is there any easy way this can be done? 
 Most cases this is only done with NEW customers, so we dont have full access to their network yet, and are just assessing the network, so we wouldn't have installed any RMM agents or anything YET. Only after the audit is completed, and we propose a contact with them, and they accept, do we go forward with RMM tools.
 ​
 What im looking for is a tool i can use before the later stages of us installing, example, ninjarmm agents on the computers.
 ​
 In short, is there any software (preferably free, but will consider paid as well, depending on the price), that i can arrive on someone's network, plug into their network (or connect wireless), and scan taht subnet, and get all the system info for all devices? (Even if i have to enter like a domain admin credential to allow it to authroize the scan on domain computers).

Deny any inbound ICMP traffic to the office enterprise network by default for security and allow only from trusted monitoring sources as needed. 
 Allow all inbound ICMP for ease of monitoring (say circuit uptime) or troubleshooting convenience assuming the chances of an ICMP DoS attack on the office public IPs is potentially negligible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Might be a stupid question but here goes....
 Were currently experiencing network performance issues, the internet speed is very slow on client devices that are hardwired into the network. All client devices are apparently negotiating at a 1Gbps connection but the network cabling in the walls does not look like it's CAT 5E or higher, possible CAT 5 10 / 100 Mbps. All patch cables are CAT 5E and above.
 If the client devices connect to the network switch like the example below, will the computer negotiate at 1Gbps speed or will it say 100Mbps? 
 Client Device > Cat 5E patch cable plugs into wall jack > CAT ? > goes to patch panel ? CAT 5E patch cables to the network switch.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I've been getting a lot more into fiber networking recently and I had some questions about the practicality of using fiber between networking devices in the rack. If you need a short run, lets say maybe 0.5 - 1 foot I know what you can get DAC cables of that length, but what about using SFP/SFP+ connectors with fiber cables into a LC/LC fiber keystone? 
 TLDR; From a practicality and performance standpoint, would there realistically be any issues with using SFP/+ modules and LC fiber cables to connect switching appliances for short runs instead of DAC? (excuse my ignorance with anything here lol new to fiber networking and trying to go 10Gig!)

Presently they pay me 50k CAD (~37k USD), I am required to travel with most expenses being covered (Gas, Food, misc expenses but I need to upfront the costs). 
 ​
 Do you think asking for 60-65k (45-48k USD) would be fair as i have gotten no pay raises since my hire.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm basically been given the choice to become a devops or continue/go back to programming of sorts but I've been absolutely on the fence for a while now as I guess its a bit of identity crisis, I've been on loan to this devops team for around 2 years now, doing mostly beginner devops sort of things but I come from a programmer background (by this I mean uni - c++/c#/javascript whatnot), my original team did full stack from backend to front end (so sql/a couple of database languages through to html/javascript) but it was put on hold and if I go back (it hasnt been made clear what I'd fully go back to but..) I'm most likely to end up doing mostly backend stuff (which honestly isn't my ideal choice).
 It's not that I don't like devops work (least what I've seen so far) it's just part of me I guess will always be a programmer in nature (I just can't see it in the backend work we do). 
 Has anyone been in a similar position before? I'm honestly at this point leaning I guess towards the devops work just as a bit of future proofing I guess, but in my brain its a bit of a mess of what I should really pick/would be happy doing.

 Hi Everyone
 I have been tasking with upgrading all devices at a client from 2013 Office Pro Plus to 2019 Pro Plus I have to do this for approximately 80 Computers. 
 I want to avoid downloading the installer on every device so I have specified a source for the installer. 
  
I have a folder on a shared network drive that has the xml/setup/setup files: Folder/XML File. "Office" is where the installer files are 
 I have a batch file that has the install command setup.exe /configure Configuration.xml
  
When I remote into a test device, and run this batch file, I get an issue where office "Fails to Download" 
 Searched up and down all over the web and I cant find anything specific to ODT
 https://imgur.com/a/as8nkFz
 If I remove my source path and let it download the installer runs fine,
 Does anyone know what might be causing this? Id rather not have the deployment download the files 80+ times on every device as this will hammer the network too much
 Thanks

 For example I am company A that goes to company B for IT services, company B outsource to C and D and so on. Quality drop because it workers are treated like crap, low pay no benefits etc. And companies also suffer because they get bad services. 
 Here's another example comp A outsource to Company B. Company be sends Billy to be there full time and look after then. Billy get paid $20 hour and company B bill company A $100 for Billy... Billy is not happy. Company B suffer too. Why doesnt bring all IT back in house and treat them like humans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Started doing IT work last year, and I inherited the last person's backpack. Great to have it but it is enormous on me; he was a big guy. I have narrow shoulders and am short, to boot, so it hangs too low and is pretty uncomfortable walking around wearing it when it is full of 15" laptop, chargers, cables, misc parts and batteries, etc. I saw this thread on different sub, and the Everiki Atlas looks great except some Amazon comments say it is large for a small person to wear comfortably. Looking at other posts on this sub, I do love Swiss Gear but yeah, too big. Comfort matters more as I age.
 Any small people who have recommendations? Some brands make "women specific" packs for narrow shoulders and smaller frames, but these are mostly hiking type backpacks. I like the multi-section approach of a tech specific pack like the Atlas, and since I also want to use it as an under-the-seat backpack for personal travel, I appreciate the extra features of easy access top pocket, sleeve, etc. I may just buy a 11-15" Atlas and try it, but thought I'd check here first. Thanks.

 I'm looking for an open source tool that will capture specific usage metrics (CPU, Memory, etc) for each process running. CheckMK does this wonderfully on Windows and Linux but not so well on Mac (at least I haven't been able to get it going).
 Looking for a client/server model that does this. Do you guys know of any that fit these requirements?

 due to changes we're 
 making for security reasons, we need to 
 add a vlan to our swithces but so it'll be visible t o specific network.
 ​
 to make things clearer 
 we are creating a new network 
 segment dedicated to backup systems.
 that network needs to be accesible from a small
 number of computers. 
 ​
 our initial idea was to filter it via 
 fw but then again the new network
 might still be visible to others.
 ​
 is is possible to create some sort of 
 an access list per vlan?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I've just realised something that is a bit annoying. When I create a symbolic link to a network share, then navigate to that symbolic link and open any subfolder on that share, the context menu "New" option only shows the "Folder" option with the UAC logo. See this picture.
 These are the steps to recreate the issue:
 1. Create a symbolic link on a command prompt: mklink /d d:\LocalFolder\ \\NAS\NAS_Folder 2. Navigate to d:\LocalFolder 3. Open any subfolder inside that symbolic link. 4. Right click/New. You will see only the "Folder" option with the UAC shield. 
 It's worth noting that if I directly access the \\NAS\NAS_Folder and open any subfolder, the New menu shows all available options and the UAC shield is gone.
 What's going on and how could I prevent that behaviour? Disabling UAC from registry only gets rid of the shield but the context menu still shows just the Folder option.
 PS: I've tried this also on a recently installed Windows VM. Same thing happens.
 ​
 edit: This person is having a similar issue.

 I had a quick question today - Has anyone created a form which users can fill (First name, last name, employee ID and email) which then goes to the sysadmin email distribution list for approval. The next step is a tad more complex - If approved, it would then make a local AD account automatically.
 I was looking for a solution using Power Automate, but that seems to be mostly aimed for Azure environments and I think needs a PS script to perform the LDAP related changes. I've also been investigating a locally hosted PHP/HTML/CSS/JS instance which could do this, but it's not my strongest skill.
 I did see a paid product called Adaxes (I believe) which can do this, but ideally would like a free solution.
 Just looking for a solution to ease the flow of new staff members at my site this year.
 Any suggestions are welcome!
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a container that I want to expose to the public internet which acts as a proxy to a private subnet hosting a bunch of applications. The exposed container is an authentication proxy that validates auth headers before forwarding upstream to the private subnet.
 Is the idea to put the auth proxy container on the host network since host can communicate to all bridge networks? From here, I would put NGINX & all software on a user-defined bridge network to isolate from the public internet but accessible via the auth container on the host network?
 Curious if I'm missing anything with respect to security and isolation.
 Example:
  
Auth Proxy: Network mode is host running on port 80 and 443 for plain HTTP and TLS
 
NGINX: Runs in user defined bridge network, let's say 172.16.0.0/16
 
App 1: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.5
 
App 2: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.6
 
 I don't want the public internet to be able to talk to NGINX or App 1 or App 2, but force communication to proxy through auth container bound to host. 
 As an additional question, is it true the host can always talk to a container on a user-defined bridge network? Is it possible to ensure only App1 & App2 can only be communicate to via NGINX and not the host? I assume something like the following would suffice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been troubleshooting issues related to intermittent packet loss on my Comcast EDI circuit. To test this I have been running ping plotter on a machine directly hooked up to my WAN switch. When the packet loss happens the route in the Carrier network changes to 1 or more different routes until it returns back to the route that I have had previously. So far the longest packet loss that this has caused lasted 3 seconds. This has been observed multiple time in an hour during business hours.I have to wait until Monday to hear back from my assigned engineer.
 For those working at carriers is my observation correct, or is there something that I could be missing?

 I was wondering if anybody had any useful tools to visualise / document network address space usage.
 We use a /16 network address which is subnetted by environment then subnetted again, and again….
 This address space usage is currently documented in a table and although accurate, it isn’t the most “accessible” documentation.
 I was wondering if anybody had any tools / tips for improving the format of this documentation to show more clearly the “hierarchical” structure of the network, the size of the subnets and the unused address space we have.

We access our enviroments via Jump Host that tunnels HTTPS, RDP and SSH. We have S2S VPN from this Jumphost with BiNAT assigned via Netbox. We would like to connect to the destination via FQDN, only the Jumpbox need to resolve the destination host. So if your on-Site you can still connect with the same FQDN that resolves to 'the real' local IP. Best case would be if we can translate all the IPs on-the-fly to the binat IP address that is used by the jumpxbox. Does ayone know a solution that could do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have a question about point to point vs multipoint networks (hub and spoke).
 I work in a school district which is very high density. Multiple sites connected over a Metro E connection. Would a hub and spoke or a point to point be better for this application. I would think a hub and spoke would be best due to limiting the broadcast seen by other switches. To give you an idea of my network, on a daily basis I sit at roughly 14,000 devices. I think a hub and spoke is the way to go due to limiting traffic on the incoming interfaces to what is destined to that router. The switches all share the same native vlan 300 (no IPs exist). Each individual site and the shared core have a unique vlan (vlan 30x) with their own /30 between the two. 
 Even though they all share the same metro e, am I correct in saying a hub and spoke separated by vlans (30x) would be better then all of the sites sharing the same vlan (300)? The sites really dont have a reason to communicate between each other. Traffic mostly goes between the site and the core, then out to the internet. 
 Thank you for your help.

 The plan is to keep the 2 contractors until I can hire permanent staff to replace their roles and transfer any knowledge. 
 Interested in hearing how others approach managing their teams from a rota basis. For example, should contractors be expected to be on-site 5-days a week unlike perm staff who are on-site 3? How about swapping days

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have no idea how IIS works, so please forgive any obvious lack of some fundamental understanding with this question. After so many years of system admin experience, I honestly feel kinda silly typing all this out:
 So, I have a webserver at my office where multiple sites are hosted. So there are several domains all pointed to, for example 192.168.1.50. How is the traffic differentiated between domain1.com and domain2.com when IIS receives the traffic?
 If I am setting up a second webserver or troubleshooting dns issues, etc, I am aware that I can edit the hosts file locally to force a computer to resolve a particular domain to a different IP. So, for instance, if I am migrating one webserver to another, I can do preliminary testing by updating the local host file on a test PC. I guess my question is, is it possible to pull specific web pages via IP somehow, and not edit the hosts file?
 More specifically, if I simply browse to 192.168.1.50 I just get an IIS page. What would the syntax of the url be if I am able to pull a specific site by IP? I feel like there is some building block here that I'm missing that keeps me from really understanding what's going on here.
 If my wall of text isn't clear, heres an example scenario:
 Web Server 1 - 192.168.1.50
 DNS a record domain1.com 192.168.1.50
 DNS a record domain2.com 192.168.1.50
 I set up Webserver 2 and perform a migration.
 Webserver 2 192.168.1.51
 no DNS records, but IIS is serving out a copy of domain1.com and domain2.com
 So, I can set the local host file on a network attached PC to point domain1.com & domain2.com to 192.168.1.51 and perform some testing.
 Is it possible to pull domain1.com and domain2.com by IP on 192.168.1.51 without editing the local hosts file? If I simply browse to 192.168.1.51 at this point, I would just receive a welcome to IIS page or whatever.

I think certifications are great when trying to learn new technologies especially when you may not have real world experience but want to broaden your knowledge. However, I believe real world experience goes a lot further with future employers than just have a cert alone. So I am curious, if you hold a cert in a given area and have years of real world experience in that area, do you try to keep your certs active or focus on learning new things and moving on to other certs? I am a network engineer with 7 years in the field. I currently hold my CCNP but it expires in Aug. I am contemplating renewing my cert mainly due to how time consuming it is, when I could be working on broadening my knowledge base with say a cloud cert or some other technology. Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/sysadmin,
 we finally got approved budget for testing for our fairly new department and would really like to create a test environment so we don't have test things in production and pray to god.
 At the end of the month there are going to be 8 members that need to have a place to test thing out before we do any changes to production/show new solutions to our clients. This is going to be totally separate tenant.
 We need to be able to replicate real world scenarios ranging from O365 (apps, sec), Exchange, hybrid AD / AAD, Power Apps to Intune, Windows devices, Security, Compliance etc. so we are ready to offer the solutions with them.
 I've got couple of ways in mind on how to do this but I would like to know how did you guys approach this; 
 - Did you just copy/paste tenant settings from the production environment?
 - Do I just purchase 8 E5 licences or its mostly E3s and couple of E5s for edge cases?
 - Or do we just purchase licences for the generated test users that we are testing things on and admin accounts stays unlicences / have plain O365 E1 for email?
 - How many test users you have in directory?
 - Is everyone global admin or you select few global admins and rest have their own individual permissions?
 - For computers do you use VMs or just couple of old laptops?
 Any tips are appreciated. Would really like to make this right for our team. Thank you.

Can anyone confirm which type of connector my laptop uses for ethernet connectivity? Additionally, I am wondering where these two types of connectors are typically used.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that we’ve moved most of our services to the cloud, historic sysadmin roles in my organization are experiencing a bit of an identity crisis. It seems like the overlords are unsure where we fit into the business model, and I’m struggling to define it myself. I recognize we have a growing need for Data and Business Analysts, and for PMs from time to time. I’m in a large international org, 10k plus users split across multiple domains. 
 I’m curious what others have experienced once the bulk of the operations have been outsourced. Do you find yourselves in a simple break/fix role, or did your org just reduce headcount?

 I found an old P330i in a thrift store that still works but needs a firmware update. I tired creating an account on the Zebra site but it was asking for license/account codes. I understand the need for this for current models but since this one has been officially discontinued for years now, I was wondering if there was any other way to get firmware for discontinued products.
 TIA

 We are getting a DNS issue that we have never faced before.
 We host a domain with our own nameservers. Our domain has this zone (zone.example.com) in which we created a CNAME record (www.zone.example.com) and pointed it to a CloudFront website (a123455789.cloudfront.com).
 This website only works in some world regions because for some reason the nameservers of zone.example.com in those regions changed to the AWS CloudFront website NSs. As such the clients can no longer resolve the address.
 Every CNAME we create point to that CloudFront website gets this behaviour. I am very new to DNS but our partners are also unable to explain it...
 What am I missing? Really confused here.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a site that has been a problem child for me since I've started working my current position. I noticed a decent chunk of packet loss, but it's in the middle of a canyon and the only connection we are able to get at the moment is LTE.
 In the past I had written this off as a bad connection due to LTE and haven't looked into it a ton, but after monitoring the LTE modem I didn't see a ton of packet loss to it. I figured no problem, they get a ton of power outages, and don't have a generator.
 Their router is likely fried. Since it's the middle of the winter I held off on driving to the site until I had a free day to tackle it. I replaced the router and tested and everything seemed fine, but after a few days I started seeing heavy packet loss again.
 Looking at the logs I'm seeing that it's giving ESP errors and all of my phase 2 tunnels are constantly going up and down. I've verified that all algorithms match up perfectly along with DH and autokey time. The VPN profile is a carbon copy of all of my other sites but this is the only one that has any issue.
 My setup from the branch to the data center is Fortigate (Station FW) -> Cradle point Modem (LTE) -> Palo Alto (Data center FW). My ping times vary between 100-500ms and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar whether doing passthrough with a cradlepoint or with high latency causing the tunnel to constantly crash. Or if there are any pointers on what else I can try.

 I often participate in online discussions related to computer networking and datacenters. And of course there I like to share my own experiences about those topics there. However/ a bit of background information, about me, I live and work in the balkans. Some naysayers would say central europe, but 'ex-Yugoslavia' might be a better term. However for practicality I will call it 'the balkans' as for the purposes of this post I don't want to be confused with Germany or Switzerland.
 Let's get back on topic. I like to talk online about my experiences in computer networking and datacenters online. However, all my experiences have been on the Balkan. When I hear the word datacenter, my first thought are the three local public datacenters I often visit and the local state run IX.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I help out periodically with some former contacts and I had one approach me to help find a VPN solution that they can roll out to take that load off their firewall. Currently all SSL mobile clients authenticate against the internal user database of their firewall, which also deals with the user certificates. Their rate of growth has made this a bit of a pain to manage needless to say and almost impossible to monitor and audit.
 They are going to replace the firewall (already have the new one) and found they can't simply migrate the users, so we are on the hunt to find something more manageable and fluid. If they have to reconfigure each client, may as well move forward rather than sideways. Authentication against on prem AD is a must, 2FA is a bonus. 
 Cisco? Palo Alto? Fortigate? Full disclosure- I have been out of this game for a few years now (after 20 years in the trenches) and I haven't really followed too closely. Looking for ideas and places to start digging. It seems most want/ require you to change your firewalls out for theirs. This isn't really an option nor is it desired. To be honest being able to host something on a VM would be the best option, but even a dedicated appliance is way better than what they have currently.
 ​
 About 50-60 mobile clients, mostly RDP connections- that's really about it.

 To some degree, I wonder if this is a lose-lose battle since users have different needs (resolution, scaling, etc.) and then on top of that if you can provision display configurations how does it know which monitor is which?

 We were hit on the at the end of December. We don’t have an IT department any more (we are a satellite office albeit a large one), so I’ve become Mr. IT for the time being. (I’m not a novice by any means and it’s not that far from my real job, but I’m certainly not the IT guy or Sys Admin!)
 Parent office dealing with the “proper stuff” (legal, dealing with the “hackers” etc) but I’m trying to restore order to the place, bring functionality back. 
 Obviously now is the time I’ve realised no one has ever thought about verifying our backups before….. they are a mess! All systems having to be rebuilt from scratch (not a bad thing really…….), but at least some of the important data we needed still exists.
 There’s not really a point to this point apart from a general “what a week” and “screw ransomware groups” (although I have a slight respect for them - It’s very impressive the damage they can do, it’s slightly fascinating!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can you all recommend a TV for a conference room setup? I am thinking 55-65". The budget doesn't allow for a digital signage or commercial screen. I looked at dumb TVs, and the Sceptres had a lot of bad reviews. So I am hoping to find a consumer TV that will default to the HDMI input, so the users don't have to deal with the smart features.
 Edit: This TV will be in a conference room, and only used for showing presentations during meetings. That is why I want the input to stay on HDMI at all times. It won't connect to a network at any point. The perfect solution for this is a dumb TV, but since those are either junk or too expensive I can't use one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past 5 years we been dealing with terrible internet access from Spectrum Business. A week does not goes by with out us having to reset our cable modem or/and deal with a couple minutes outages, sometimes even hours. We are subscribed to the 600/35 plan. I have always wanted more upload speeds so we started looking for a fiber connection.
 After contacting 3 ISP I narrow it down to two companies. One is offering 1gbps symmetrical from one of their nearby PON for $489 no SLA, this connection is not dedicated, but the sales person claims that the PON is not currently being used by any other company and this has been the case for years, he even claimed (and I actually believed this) this should remain the case since the types of businesses in my street are not the type to required these speeds or reliability. The second company is able to provide a dedicated fiber line to their datacenter, after weeks of negotiation I was able to get them to come down to $730 a month for 1gbps with a 99.999% SLA. Both connections requires a 48 months agreement. Honestly we dont need this level of connection but we could really use the upload speeds to run our own cloud storage solution (nextcloud, plex, databackup services) and couple other things. in reality a 100x100mbps connection is sufficient but the price at that point wouldn't be substantially lower since they need to recover their construction cost.
 My question is, under these circumstances would you pay $241 more to have the dedicated connection with a SLA and guaranteed speeds, latency and data packet loss? or should I just save the money and go with the cheaper solution. Thanks for your opinions.

 I hope I'm in the right spot. I've purchased 6x Firepower 2110s and reimaged them with ASA v9.18(2). I'm attempting to install the Cisco Firepower 2100 Strong Encryption (3DES/AES) license. However, I'm failing at registering the device with our smart account.
 I've confirmed that the encryption license does show in our inventory. I've been following along with the official Cisco documentation found at:
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa913/configuration/general/asa-913-general-config/intro-license-smart.html#id_57012
 After creating the registration token and running the command:
 license smart register idtoken
 I see in my account the token has been used once, but the device is failing to register. Here's some output from 'sh lic status':

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God I hate Cisco. I'm a CCNP but god they are the worst the past few years.
 Configured a new ASA 1010 and shipped it to a branch across the country to replace a dead 5505. Of course with the 1010's, Cisco must assume all of their customers manage a single, local branch, because they don't let you use crypto commands until you register with the Smart portal to unlock strong encryption (you know, that thing that was preloaded on all the 5500 series firewalls since the PIX's went EOL???). So that means I have to wait until the site connects it to the WAN cable to get internet before I can register it and unlock VPN commands, which the business won't run without. Even worse is when it needs to go to a country in another timezone. On the 5506's I used to be able to just preconfigure the VPN, ship it and tell the on site guy to move the cables over when he starts his day in his timezone and all will work. No no. Now Cisco wants me to wake up at 2am (8am for the site the ASA is getting installed at) so I can register with them, and THEN...only then will they let me register and be granted permission to unlock crypto commands. Scum.
 Today this scenario happened for me, but the Smart Portal is spitting traceback errors at me, and as a result, I can't view my inventory or create new license tokens, which means I can't register the 1010 to be able to put the VPN's up, and had to roll everything back. 
 Come on Cisco. Your ASA customers are NOT Fisher Price engineers managing one location, and nobody that buys an ASA is doing so for their home. Yet you insist on making things easier for residential and mom/pop shop operations and harder for enterprise/commercial grade large multi-location international companies with every new generation of hardware.

 I've gone back through IAM and created groups/roles so some accounts (assuming they re-sync from AzureAD groups) will have permission changes, like going from Owner > Editor. Just not sure if other resources that these users may have created will get caught in the process.
 Looking for the best way to clean this up, since usernames are the same on both sides.
 Production workloads were stood up in GCP before I was even aware of it and not terribly familiar with Google's behavior so just being careful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 I'm having an issue I've never encountered, and I'd like to get some insight as I've scoured the internet for days. It takes some work to explain. 
 For context, I took over at my location about nine months ago. We recently had a scheduled power outage at our location. Our primary devices were on generators to prevent them from shutting down. Other devices around the location did get powered off. 
 Our core switch is a Ruckus ICX7650-48F. After power was restored, I cannot ssh into any Cisco switch directly connected to the core. Any HP/Aruba device directly connected works with SSH and ping. The same is true for any cisco device downstream from an HP/Aruba. 
 Although this is happening, everything around the site is running fine from an operational standpoint. We have wireless and all ethernet working. 
 We have a Cisco 3650 directly below the core in the rack that I've been troubleshooting. When I checked spanning-tree on it, I noticed a VLAN ID mismatch with two different VLANs. Our management VLAN and the Trunk VLAN. Nothing has changed in the configuration, and I've double checked that there isn't a mismatch like it says. I get this error with all Cisco switches. 
 I've done quite a bit of troubleshooting and need more ideas. If you need more information, I will make sure to send that to you by PM. 
 Thank you!!
 TLDR: Scheduled power outage, and the management VLAN doesn't work on Cisco devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning all,
 I figure I would touch on something that many other people could relate to. 
 ​
 I DON'T understand why but, Why is it that when someone asks for help in the IT world on reddit, SO many people seem to just comment with anything BUT the actual help needed. If you cant help maybe just move on to something else?
 It may be a different weird type of nerdy 'cockyness' but god, why can't people just be courteous?
 Why waste your and my time just to be useless and put others down?
 Anyways, For those of you who are on the opposite end of the spectrum, Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a school network currently running on a Cisco ASA 5516-X connected to a 9200L acting as a core switch, with VLAN information being sent from the core switch to the access switches via VTP. 
 We are demoing a Palo Alto firewall and I'm interested in getting visibility into our intra-network routing to the firewall, and putting up some blocks in place. For instance, only our Faculty/Staff users need access to the printers and projectors VLAN, but guest wifi users don't.
 Is that the right move? And if I do that, what is the process of moving the VLANs up to the firewall? I've been reading over this thread on the Cisco forums and it sounds like our path, but If I delete the VLANs off of the core, VTP will wipe out the VLANs on the access level switches

I currently work at an MSP and we have a rotating monthly oncall schedule. I missed a call that came in at 2:00 am; my cell is right on my nightstand, it did indeed ring at max volume, but I just slept through it.
 Management is very upset I missed the call but I honestly don't know how to move forward with this. I don't know what steps I can take to prevent this from happening again if I don't have control over whether or not I sleep. 
 For the record I'm hourly, and do not get compensated for being oncall - only when work is being done am I paid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm currently setting up a VXLAN connection between 2 sites. The sites are connected using redundant 10Gbps infrastructure, there are some routers (2 or 3, depending on the connection) in between. Unfortunately I cannot change these connections and the MTU I get at each end is 1500 .
 I've setup a linux machine on each side, created a VXLAN connection in between, connected an additional network adapter to the network of the site and bridged the vxlan interface.
 FRR distributes the needed information using BGP evpn.
 I can ping from left to right without problems, iperf testing using UDP gets me to a little over 1Gbps (less than expected, but OK for now). However, iperf testing using TCP gets me 10Mbps at max.
 Is this purely the path MTU that is messing with the TCP connections?
 Is there a way to get TCP faster in this scenario or should we just ditch it and look for other options?

 at large sites, I usually use network access control solutions from Extreme or Cisco, for example to block individual ports on switches or to prohibit or allow connections from A to B, depending on the use case. Now if I have smaller environments and want to use only low cost hardware (NETGEAR, D-LINK..) because this location is not so important, what is the best way to do it? Which must be a feature: Foreign MAC addresses are not allowed to come into any network for the time being, until I allow them on the portal. How to implement something like this?

 Their cloud dashboard is clean, but the results when running the playlist weren't great.
 Powerpoints looped when in a playlist, for example.

 Luckily this is only affecting select remote users and of course IT while attempting to connect to servers.

 Replication seems to be working as intended... any advice is appreciated! Thank you

 We are in the process of relocating to a new office building, which will include a network setup build from the ground up. We currently have around 200 employees and are expecting to grow within 2 years to around 500-600 employees. 
 We currently use Ubiquiti for our AP's, switches and firewall. I have read online that Ubiquiti is fine for home and small office environments, but not so much for anything beyond that. This is also something that was confirmed by our IT partner that will be installing the network equipment in our new office. They suggest using Extreme AP's in conjuction with Aruba switches and firewall.
 I was wondering what everybody's take on this is ? Is it indeed a good idea to switch to Aruba/Extreme, or should we stay with Ubiquiti?

I've gone far enough to know that it appears to be related to moderns apps being prevented from running. For example, I go into event viewer under Applications and Services / Microsoft / Windows / AppLocker / Packaged app-Deployment I see a ton of errors relating to AAD Broker Plugin, Windows Search, Start Menu experience host. We don't have any applocker rules and it's only affecting random machines. I can't explain the cause but does anyone know the fix? We have about 15,000 machines+ and our service desk gets probably 5-6 calls a day on it. Re-imaging the machine has been our only fix to this point. If I try running powershell scripts to re-register these apps I get an error saying it was blocked by policy. Also to note we are using WSUS/SCCM and block the private store as we use store for business. I have enabled a registry key to allow for automatic downloads of store apps.

 It seems there are a lot of approaches (Azure Migrate service, Azure Disaster Recovery, etc).
 But none of them is explained clearly in the Azure docs.
 So, I can make an AMI from that AWS EC2 instance and store it in AWS S3.
 And then I can copy that AMI file to Azure Storage.
 But what do I do after that? 
 My goal is to duplicate that VM on Azure, I'll still keep the one on AWS. And there is no data getting updated in real -time.
 So, there is no concern regarding downtime or replication or anything like that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're an MSP. One of our clients has 11 main sites, with a few satellites at a few of the main sites. Most of the main sites have WatchGuard Fireboxes. We were tasked with whitelisting two fairly large CIDR blocks (a /20 and a /23.) It's easy to do in WatchGuards, in "Blocked Site Exceptions," where you can choose an IPv4 network. But, one main site has a cheap Linksys or Netgear. (I can't remember the brand. But, I'm pretty sure it's one of the two.) 
 That site is pushing back on cost and wants to know what the cheapest firewall is that can whitelist CIDR blocks of IPs. I don't think stuff off the shelf at retail shops can do it. Any ideas? Since we're a MSP, we've switched to the new leasing monthly choice for firewalls. (I don't like the new model, personally. But, I'm a team player.). It doesn't even have to be real cheap, but rather a pay once and you own it. But, they do want the cheapest that can do this.
 This is for a PCI scan to occur from a 3rd party PCI compliance scanning company.
 Also, is whitelisting essentially making an allow any statement for ports 1-65535?

 Just wanted to ask a more career-based question for you all. Work for a company that supports about 450 users, some with assets but mostly just M365 accounts. I have 7 Months of professional experience so far in IT. I am tech savvy and in my personal life built computers and always had a basic understanding of how electronics work. Though I am very inexperienced and a noob I still, however, am responsible for 3 networks and their safeguarding and troubleshooting.
 I am the most senior IT person in the company because I am the only IT person in the company except for the new hire who is more hardware focused. I know I have a long way to go experience wise but I am working toward a master's in computer security management followed by Sec+ and Net+. The title at the moment is basically help desk but with the responsibility of a systems administrator, network engineer, and Azure cloud engineer.
 CEO asked me to start thinking about what my next title should be but I don't even know what I want to do in this field. I love IT, love making something work after multiple failed attempts, and the rush of self-accomplishment when the problem is solved. I like working in Azure and Intune, have not tried my hand at coding or scrips because I am not confident in my ability to not blow everything up in the process.
 What I am asking for is just some insight on what a solid next step title would be from helpdesk. I eventually want to become a CISO in the next 8-10 years but just unsure of how to get there. Unsure of what path to take because I want to do what is best for me and also have mouths to feed at home.
 ​

 ​
 was happy with my wage when started however since firstly Its clear I am doing miles beyond most of the colleauges + knowledge I bring and also the NEW wage there offering new starters I feel I deserve a payrise.
 I asked my manager for a payrise and they wasn't able to get it.
 its coming around to the yearly review in march for payrises in the traditional sense but thats still months away.
 I personally feel deflated and have lost all motivation to go above and beyond when my colleagues doing much less are on the same money and new joiners with no knowledge can be on more.
 I personally do not want to leave in the next 6 months atleast due to happy with arrangement of working whilst I get to see my baby at home.
 ​
 Do I do the following
 Tell my manager I feel demotivated due to this.
 Do nothing and do less work
 Do above and beyond on the hope of raise in 3 months.
 ​
 ​
 I personally feel like - Option 2 and leave in 6 months but wondered peoples thoughts, I work from home so can be doing other stuff in the time I'm not fully at the machine cracking out tickets

 I've seen many tools that allow me to mount all shares in my NAS under the same letter, but only when using SFTP or WebDAV. But when it comes to samba, I have not seen that option; I have to assign each share to a single unit/letter. Is that a samba limitation? Or is it just a Windows limitation? If it's the latter, how could I overcome that limitation?

 I'm currently starting my own small firm, for that i have alot of customers which want hosting service.
 I'm want to have my own servers and everything even the upfront cost is more.
 The only really thing i'm struggling with is finding some network switches, that doesn't cost a fortune. 
 Anyone have a good idea for a SFP+ switch that can be used for storage, have used Lenovo and Aruba switches for this before, from my old company, but budget is tight. Refurbished is fine for me. 
 Also i also need a layer 3 switch for management network and 1GB ethernet equipment that need to be connected. 
 ​
 Look forward to hear some good advice

 Hey, I'm not a regular here, but right now I'm kind of at a loss.
 I never liked using the cloud service to remote manage, but right now they seem to be down for us and I fail to come up with a plan b that doesn't involve driving over there and using a port.
 Anyone know if you can grab a token from the cloud site and login directly? The http request to their site seems to include one, so they aren't entirely dead I guess.
 thanks, cheers, have a great weekend,

 We work with VPS Ubuntu and also cloud hosting and computing with Azure Portal. All our applications are booted inside Docker VMs
 Im interested in asking what you would say is key knowledge and qualities of a good sysadmin. When i hire developers we usually do a programming challenges is there something similar in the sysadmin space?
 What types of questions would you be interested to ask if you where recruiting a sysadmin?
 Thank you for taking the time reading my post. I hope i did not break any rules, to be clear this is not a recruitment post im only looking for insights from this community since i know alot of strong admins lurk in here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 We have an IPsec VPN connection for a client which worked fine, however client installed a firewall (cisco firepower 1120) and since the install, we cannot reach the other end. The VPN tunnel is created but we cannot reach the other side of the firewall. And I cannot see any traffic hitting the firewall. The client router is a Four-Faith F3424 and the VPN server Router is a dreytek vigor2920. The client router is in "gateway" mode, and in the network settings the gateway IP is the outside interface of the firewall. We have acl and nat set up to allow the client router port to inside. I can ping the client router from the server router and PC, but not the firewall. I tried trace route, but when I try to reach the other side of the firewall it looks like it does not go through the VPN tunnel. And I cannot ping the outside Interface of the firewall, however ping is allowed for testing. I upload a logical diagram, we would like to RDP from PC-A to PC-B. When I RDP i just enter 192.168.1.6 and it worked before the firewall, now the other side of the tunnel is on another subnet 192.168.50.0 Any suggestions? Should I switch the client router to router mode and create a static route? Why can't I see traffic on the firewall? .

 I've done what I can with retention policies and online archiving to reduce the size as much as possible but the performance in online mode is still appalling as you would expect.
 Cached exchange mode is essential for Exchange Online to fix this imo but what about shared folders, are you enabled "Download shared folders"? Enabling it drastically improves shared mailbox performance but at the cost of huge (20GB+) OST files. You could reduce the amount cached to 6 or 3 months but that affects user mailbox caching as well. How are you all handling this?

 So we are running a kind of hybrid environment still. Users are created in On-Prem and synced to Azure, Servers are in on-prem and workstations are in AzureAD and managed by Intune.
  
 Currently our minimum password age is at 1 day as per CIS18 1.1.3. But this is causing such a headache.
  
 If a password is reset through Azure AD, like if a supporter resets a passwords and gives to a user. They are not able to change it for 24 hours, since our on-prem AD will not see it as a password set by an administrator.
 Even worse is if the "Force user to change password on next login" is set. Then the user is asked to change their password when they log in, but they are not able to do so, since their password is not more than 24 hours old.
  
 Is there any way around this? I was hoping the minimum password age could be something more reasonable, like 15 minutes or even 30. But 24 hours is just causing such a pain in the ass for support and for the users.

I have a long background in Sys/Network Admin but with this new job as an Applications Manager I've started to learn a lot of DBA skills on the fly. Getting ready for bed I thought "Did I enable archive mode after importing the dump file?". So my anxiety got the best of me. I went to go check and sure enough archive mode was not enabled. So I ran 'shutdown immediate' (which hung for a bit and I thought I was screwed) and then started it up and enabled archive mode. Made some changes in the application and everything appears to be working. Whew! To you experienced DBAs, what would have been the downside to leaving archive mode off? Also, is it worth using RMAN for a 20GB database? The application vendor's DBA helped enable it last year when we moved from on-prem to Azure, but I have no idea how to use it if something went wrong. My plan is to use a BAT script to create a dump file every night in conjunction with Corporate's nightly backups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if it was possible to sniff packets over on cellular network, I can't find much information online, so I thought I would ask. Now I know it would be difficult, as you don't have control over the cell tower like you would over your home or business's router, but if you can receive what other phones or cellular capable devices are transmitting couldn't you be able read what is in the packets just like you can in a Wi-Fi network, as you are connected to them? Or is a different encryption key used by each device? And as I haven't been able to find much online, could someone link some information on the encryption methods used on cellular networks? 
 I have one more thing that needs clearing up about cellular networks. What exactly assigns your IP address, is it something at the cell site, meaning your address changes as you change towers? Or is something else responsible for that? And how is data routed to the cell tower, how does it know that your data is intended for it, does it have it's own IP address? If so how does it know in the case of mobile calls and SMS, because as far as I am aware those don't travel over the internet? Again if you have any relevant information that you could link it would be greatly appreciated.

 I tell him about my hard times being stranded on a project, due to the Junior Tech quitting at the last moment ( he was denied a 24 month leave, having only been with the company 4 months), so I've been juggling being a sysadmin, tech and a PM at a massive hotel all by myself.
 He tells me, he has spent the last 3 months going to every morgue, pathology room, and office of the coroner. He has had to replace computers while they were doing active "projects" or moving people around. Since he has to drive to and from these sites, he has to bring back the "deceased" with him and says no matter how many cans of air fresheners, he cannot get the smell out of his work van.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding with something like Zscaler is that it's done by stitching Layer 7 TLS tunnels. There is an App Connector component which functions like a reverse proxy. It sits in front of the application server and establishes outbound connection/tunnel to the Zscaler cloud (Service Edge). On the user's device, the client software also creates an outbound tunnel to the Zscaler cloud. The two tunnels are stitched together by the Zscaler Service Edge. For each client-to-app connection, there is a separate micro-tunnel pair.
 I think Azure AD Application Proxy works in similar way except instead of client software it's just the client's web browser. Basically a client-less version.
 Have I understood this correctly and do all other ZTNA products work the same way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by the recent post of bombing an interview, for about a thread for the opposite? Mine just happened a couple of weeks ago. I had an overzealous recruiter (in a good way) that checked on me prior to the interview, and promised to call after. Anyhow, the interview is going ok from my standpoint. The questions are really focused on one particular area of expertise, not my strongest but I keep my resume honest and spoke to my knowledge in the area. About 40 minutes inI notice a call from the recruiter come through which of course I send to voice mail. The interview was originally scheduled for a half hour (lol) so I figured she was just being eager to follow up. Anyhow it wraps up about 15 minutes later and I call the recruiter back. She asks me how I thought it went. I said so-so, it wasn't my best interview, but it wasn't a bad one. 
 It turns out that she was calling because mid-interview the interviewer had messaged the recruiter to go ahead and prepare an offer letter. I've got to say that's the first time I received an offer before finishing an interview.
 So, what's your interview that you absolutely nailed?

The router has an adapter configured for 172.16.31.10, and a DHCP service to serve IPs on that address. It is bridged to the host ethernet adapter (set to 172.16.31.9) which goes via a switch to a Ruckus WLC, which is connected to an access point. Currently I can connect to the wireless network provided by the WLC, but my PC does not get an IP address on that network at all. The address for the configuration interface on the WLC is 192.168.10.14. Does this need to be set to the 172.16.31.x subnet, and if so should the gateway be the vyos router address? I can only find articles that explain WLCs from a high level, or in depth configuration guides for specific WLCs that assume an in depth knowledge of networking (which I do not have.. only some basics). My current understanding is that the vyos router should serve up IP addresses via the host (since it is bridged) and then the WLC should 'pass that' via the access point to my PC. Since it isn't working I'm guessing that is incorrect, but I don't have enough knowledge yet to know where to start looking for the issue or how to trace it. Any help/advice is much appreciated.

 ​
 About one in five American workers—approximately 30 million people—are bound by a non-compete clause and are thus restricted from pursuing better employment opportunities. A non-compete clause is a contractual term between an employer and a worker that blocks the worker from working for a competing employer, or starting a competing business, typically within a certain geographic area and period of time after the worker’s employment ends. Because non-compete clauses prevent workers from leaving jobs and decrease competition for workers, they lower wages for both workers who are subject to them as well as workers who are not. Non-compete clauses also prevent new businesses from forming, stifling entrepreneurship,…]]></summary>

As I was coming over here as an expat, I understood that FT remote was not going to be an option, but we agreed upon (with HR/my boss) at the time that as long as I came into the office 2 days a week, they were fine with me working remote the other 3 days.

 Performing a manual deployment of patches to the same groups of systems results in a 70+% success rate across the board, with the other 30% mostly being successes flagged as failures (one patch out of five failed for some reason...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been ~ 2 weeks since LastPass's 2nd breach disclosure(merely 21 days apart from the 1st - 30th November) hit mainstream news.
 Some things to note:
  
Your vault isn't in plaintext. URLs are in Base64 & HEX but passwords ARE NOT. You can confirm this from Mr. Gibson's show notes. They have directions to obtain your vault/blob via a browser - https://www.grc.com/sn/SN-904-Notes.pdf
 LastPass's offsite cloud backup data was exfiltrated. The offsite backup includes backups from their on-premises servers and regional data(required for regions with regulatory reasons)
 You should check your master password iteration counts. If it's 5,000 and you have a short(most likely 8 character password) you might be in pickle. Steve's also explained this and the history of how it came to be in the show notes. Change your master pass immediately to a longer one *and also passwords for individual sites*. Also up the iterations to 350,000.
 If you're an old(started using it circa 2008 - LastPass's start) LastPass user your vault might be a mixture of passwords in CBC & ECB mode. It seems LastPass has left passwords created in CBC "as is" when they realized and shifted to *ECB*.
  
They've made mistakes along the way like having several data breaches. Some are forgivable and can be given a pass. But I do agree with Steve that they should have *automatically "upped" the iterations on Password Based Key Derivation Functions(PBKDF2) for all clients*, Pestered people to shift to longer master passwords on client UIs and lastly, shifted those old passwords from CBC to ECB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an MPLS connection that I route = specific voice traffic over in one of our India offices. I run EIGRP between the MPLS PE and my core so that when the routes go down that traffic is then routed out the default gateway. This works great for when users were in the office but with the shift to remote/hybrid its causing some voice quality issues for remote users.
 Users have been told to use the tunnel all option to force that voice traffic through the VPN and across the MPLS. Obviously tunneling all their traffic is less than ideal and we get a fair amount of complaints about slow downloads and poor voice quality. We do have split-tunneling but that sends that voice traffic out their local gateways and that can be painful as well. We are doing dynamic split-include for some other domains but without the MPLS need on the backend. 
 What I am trying to figure out is if I add this voice domain to that split include will it route it via the MPLS when the routes are present and out through the ASA when the routes are gone (because MPLS is down)? That domain would be tunnel'd all the time and I simply don't know how it will work when the routes are gone?

 What do you guys think would be some of the most useful things to do in this situation would be? What do you wish your predecessors would have done before they left?
 For background, there are a couple of junior guys, but there is a pretty good experience and training gap between them and me. There are a number of systems that neither of them has ever touched. We have some documentation, but it's pretty basic, mainly just indicating what systems we have, where the backups are, etc.
 I don't know whether the company is going to hire a replacement, promote a junior guy, or something else.
 Edit: I'm leaving because a really good opportunity at an interesting place came up, and not because I'm mad at my current company or anything like that. We are parting on good terms. I have colleagues here that I know well and am on good terms with. I've used some of them as references before, and probably will again.

 We use Office 365 at my org.

 I've already verified that none of my SPF records are >= 255 characters. (we use several "includes"s).
 We do have spf.protection.outlook.com in there as an include. When I look at the report, there are some servers in the 52.100.0.0/14 block are listed as being unaligned, but they are, in fact, in the record.
 Anyone know WTF could be going on here?

 We're looking at ordering an Aruba CX6100 (JL677A). I need it to do 2 or 3 very basic static routes for a small network with relitlvely little traffic. It says its a L2 switch, but the datasheet (linked below) very specifically says:
 "Static IP routing provides manually configured routes" 
 Aruba CX6100 Switch Series - Datasheet (arubanetworks.com) 
 My VAR, though, is saying that this is a misleading statement in the datasheet, and it'll only allow for a single "default-gateway" command and won't in fact route traffic, and that we need to step up to a 6200 if we want any basic static IPv4 routing. 
 Does anyone have any direct experience with this model and can weigh in on its capabilities?

 Now, we have a problem. First of all, it's been replaced only on some of the computers, also in the same Tenant (all have the 2211 version of office, managed updates).
 Second problem... It wants to use Roaming Signatures. THAT feature that MS is trying to implement from july 2021, and it still isn't working. And it always breaks the powershell commands to set signatures for the accounts.
 And with this new screen, it's not possible to select a local signature as default. Only cloud ones. IF you can select one at all. On some of the computers, everything is grayed out.
 And Cloud synced signatures... sometimes they're there. Sometimes an older version is there. Sometimes they're not there at all.

I could perhaps understand AV on an outside accessible web-server or something, but for internal servers like LDAP, DNS, DHCP, print services, those type of things, I've never installed any extra or 3rd party anti-virus. These days, Windows Defender (or whatever it's called) is pretty great at detecting potentially malicious code/tools, and obviously no end-users are touching these machines.
  
Do any solutions exist that act like an "AV server"? In that, it's a server that perhaps runs a nightly scan on a list of machines, so that a 3rd party AV wouldn't need to be installed everywhere?
 What do you guys do for AV on servers? 3rd party, or Windows Defender enough? Everywhere I've worked we didn't install 3rd party AV on servers. Newest place I work they have Malwarebytes installed on EVERYTHING. They want it replaced with bitdefender and told me to be careful because when they installed Malwarebytes it wreaked havok on the servers, blocking critical services and whatnot. I personally don't want to put bitdefender on the servers, rather just for end-devices. If there's a good cloud or hosted AV solution that can be run from a central server and not be required to be installed to system, that would be cool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 We are thinking to outsource our IT since it is very hard to find an employee and I was wondering if you ever happened to do something similar and what kind of documents did you sign. Are there any agreement documents out there that can be used as a templates in such occasions? Are there any culprits that I should be aware of, based on your experience?
 The services of interest are:
 - Networking ( pfsense routers, APs, VPNs, etc)
 - Office365 Administration
 - Support
 - Wiki/Documentation maintenance 
 Any ideas/suggestions are welcome

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys (and girls). 
 I'm currently in adoption of some Security Standards, like ISO 27001 and 27701. And there is always the moment that we need to talk about "employee security training and awareness". 
 As in most companies, security isn't a big priority to the employees here. The rule is "the easier, the better", and security falls to the bottom. 
 So, I'm here to ask for some guidance. 
 What are your experiences with Training, Awareness and Education on Security? Both on the perspective of listener and speaker. Which points should I focus? How to make it interesting for the End-Users, and yet, assertive? How to make it work in a non-tedious way?
 And by "Training, Awareness and Education", I mean e-mails, quick tips on security, blog posts, big presentations, gamifications, surveys...
 Thanks :)

 I have been testing out OMV while waiting on my hardware to come in for a proper server, and thanks to another redditor, I have almost everything set up, but there seems to be an issue connecting remotely. I have a domain name through namecheap, as well as DNS settings through Cloudflare, already set up. I can access my server through "domain.net" or "www.domain.net" locally, but not remotely. 
 This is frustrating me to no end, and I am sure the person helping me is getting frustrated too. Any help would be appreciated.

 ​
 Some help please!!!
 I have been tasked to migrate/consolidate 2 file share server running on Server 2008 to Server 2018. 
 ​
 I have spent some time looking at the Microsoft Storage Migration Service tool, it seems that there are three main tasks to perform 
 1) File Share discovery 2) Copy data from old to new server 3) Final cutover, I notice that the Storage Migration Service tool 
  
doesn't seem to support consolidating multiple file servers into one
 doesn't seem to allow file share migration in a phrase approach, e.g migrate a smaller number of shares first, test/confirm its all working then move on to the next lot. 
  
Am I missing something here? I start to wonder if the Storage Migration Service is the right tool for the task?
 Any help would be much appreciated. 
 ​
 Thanks,
 Chris

 10.0.2.0/23 (VLAN 2)
 10.0.4.0/23 (VLAN 3)
 10.0.6.0/23 (VLAN 4)
 etc.
 Or I could just do
 10.1.0.0/23 (VLAN 10)
 10.2.0.0/23 (VLAN 20)
 10.3.0.0/23 (VLAN 30)
 The reason for doing it the second way would just be to make the subnet/VLAN pairing more obvious. I would be able to look at any subnet and just know what VLAN it belongs to without having to look it up in a reference spreadsheet or something.
 It's a SMB network in a VERY niche manufacturing industry and the company WILL NEVER become very big. It's about as big as it will ever get. This is fact. Subnet expansion isn't an issue. It will also never expand to other locations. This is purely for compartmentalising interal resources, e.g. servers, phones, laptops, guest wifi, cctv, etc.
 How would you subnet in this scenario?

 I'm writing you this as a rant about Cisco switches.
 What went down? We established a new kronjob on our switches that basically saves the config every week and pushes it to some remote fileserver as backup. 
 What I did not know up to that point: There's a bug in the switches when:
  
C9000 Switches are stacked
 Kron Job with "write" is in the config
  
that causes the switch to crash whenever you want to save the config afterwards.
 "Well that looks like a major oversight and has to be fixed in some point right?" HAHAHAHA
 That bug is known by cisco since May 2019 and there is no fixed version right now. They only tell you to use the EEM instead (wich is a really cool feature ngl)
 To top it all of: There's a chance of the master-switch to crash and reboot when you try to get rid of the config line.
 *sigh*
 Hope y'all had a somewhat chill start in this year. I'm off fixing/restarting switches in our facility...
 On a positive note: Cisco EEM looks really awesome. Will get into that a bit and see what you can do with that.

 Some examples given are:
  
InstallShield: "This Setup was created with a BETA VERSION of InstallShield Developer"
 Inno Setup: "This installation was built with Inno Setup"
 Wise: " This installation was built with InstallAware: http:// www installaware com "
  
I'd like to get your inputs on the other tools you know that we can add on this list.
 I'm currently looking at Winrar uninstall exe but can't find any clues on what tool was used to create it, but I know that the install switch is /S. I'd like to build a process where we can have a good guess on what the silent uninstall string are for most programs that doesn't use msiexec to uninstall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I want to remove all the mapped drives for the current user when my users are shutting down or restarting their devices. 
 I did a task scheduler that's triggering those actions and did a little cmd file that doing the job. 
 The issue seems to be the account used during the task scheduler. When running with "Builtin\Users" I don't have any errors, but it seems that the script is not running correctly. Using my AD account, everything is working well of course as I have local admin rights. 
 Run only when user is logged on is ticked. 
 Run with highest privilegies is ticked.
 Just doing that in my cmd : 
 net use * /delete /y
 reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network\* /f
 In Action tab, I just select my batch file.
 Any idea on how can I solve this issue? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope I can explain this properly.
 We have 3 sites (A, B and C) all connected by 1GB/s fibre links terminating on Layer 3 switches, the network consisting of 4 distinct subnets separated on the switches using VLANs (1-4 say) with individual switchports belonging to one VLAN (Access) and the link ports being Trunk ports. All working fine when switch A-B was an old Zyxel but this went pop and we replaced with a Dell (set up identically). After the replacement, one of the VLANs (4) on switch B-C (also Dell) stopped working and after a bit of investigation, we realised Spanning Tree had kicked in and stopped all traffic. As we currently have nothing on VLAN 1 on switch B-C we moved the cables to ports on that and all is now working. 
 I've no idea how to even start to troubleshoot this so any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.

 It's really strange that, new emails sending to that domain name is NOT blocked, only replies messages are blocked! All messages are just plain text sending from Outlook Web with no attachment at all, what is the logic of filtering all replies messages as SPAM, quarantine and NOT notify sender about this?!

 I have reached a point where network access is there and I can access the share from a windows device and r/W on it. The problem is when I try to configure any sort of group permissions. When I then try to log in the creds input window pops up, I enter creds and I get access denied error.

 I understand this is a tradeoff of going to SaaS and cloud in general. Kind of like asking what do you do when Exchange Online goes down other than wait. Does anyone have an creative ideas or experience here?

 I have one machine that I want to prioritize over anything else. My LAN is Gig everywhere, but we only have 200Mbps symmetrical for WAN.
 Example: We have 120 Mbps average traffic to internet during business day, and the priority machine wants to use more than the remaining 80 Mbps.
 Firewall is a Sophos XG310. Switches are mainly HP ProCurve, but there are slew of others too. Hoping to not have to futz with all of the switches.

Would it be possible to run a Mist environment on top of a Cisco switching/routing platform as a POC? I'm thinking more end to end trace clientapswitch>>core.

 I have a Cisco ASA configured for staff VPN, it's working great. But all of the sudden last night I'm getting a HUGE uptick in event logs from my Domain Controller handling authentication. Typically I see about 100 logs a week or so (we have about 100 employees and connecting to the vpn is not a requirement with remote work). But now it's in the 1,000,000's and is blowing out my cloud logging ingest budget.
 What's odd is I never usually see this AD account log in, but now i'm seeing it all the time, also it's authenticating accounts just fine. Its just being.......extremely noisy.
 I also have not done any changes to the firewall, nor anyone else. I've been on vacation since the middle of December.
 -Rebooted DC's already but it seems like it may have helped a little bit
 Like I said, it's a shot in the dark if anyone had and specific issues with this authentication weirdness, and has any suggestions that would be great!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m looking for an uplink solution between a PD host PoE switch. The PD end requires 70W (up to 90W at port). That said, the data throughput is tiny — a few hundred MB/s max from appx 12-15 devices per switch. Available switch options w/ this PoE++ capability kind of standardizes high bandwidth function, like QSFP or SFP+. Given, the aggregated data flow is far below thresholds for QSFP or even SFP+. Also keeping in mind, the Tx/Rx properties of the modules and mode properties of the fiber are compatible. 
 Now to my query — can an LC QSFP uplink to an LC SFP/SFP+ interface port on the aggregate switch?

 In France we have what we call « croissantage », the principe is if you leave your computer unattended with your session unlocked one of your colleague is allowed to send a message “croissant” to the whole team on Slack (or any IM / email system) and then you have to bring croissants the next morning at breakfast for everyone.
 This is some sort of security awareness but more fun (well not for everyone ofc). 
 So Im trying to find or create a bot / integration on Slack to do that. So far I found this but it’s not free and I’d like to call it “croissant”. 
 Any idea to help me? Thanks!

 EG: 
  
Firewall/network equipment management interfaces. 
 Domain controllers (RDP, RPC or WMI etc etc)
 Radius/TACACS services
  
The attempt is to control access (Using identity based access via firewall eventually move to ZTNA) on such devices that manage other services within the domain/LAN but... issues arise when there is only one NIC which is used for access as well as standard service traffic. 
 Is there a clean way to accomplish this? Really easy to do on networking devices, but servers or apps depending on what they are adding a second interface and routing only specific traffic is a toss up.
 Anyone have any words of wisdom or is this a you'll need to build as you go rather than overhaul.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked on a wifi solution several years ago. It was the time the Wireless controller was king and we went with cisco stacks (Catalyst 3850 if I recall correctly) with integrated WLC functionality.
 Despite the AAA complex setup (handled by ISE and Active Directory) we managed to have it working correctly in a very fast way, and it proved solid and stable even after we added a domain trust after a company merge (basically we had two companies wifi SSIDs for both employees PCs, with different certificates and CAs).
 I'm not a Cisco fan anymore (since at least 10 years, after everything became a license), but I must admit that setup was old days(C) cool. 
 ​
 Now I took a glimpse to the current scenario, and everything is cloud based and AI managed and visually simple and <put marketing buzzword here> and shitty shitty shitty no CLI whatsoever and centrally administered (by someone else), microservices (what the hell is microservice for a tunnel?) and cloud-who-cares-where-it-runs.
 ​
 I know this is going to be our (hellish?) future, but I just want to put a couple of stackable switches, run the controller on them and attach (with dual redundant cables, possibly) as many AP as I need or the software allows to.
 Does any of you have a branded, enterprise or at least SMB ready solution, with local, non-cloud based wireless solution?
 I saw Cisco now sells the controller on the APs directly, but besides of a small scale (I could survive), I fear about bad performance and I would need to buy switches (with probably way more horsepower than a single AP) to connect the APs anyway.

 I'm setting up a small non-profit, starting from scratch. Since there will only be 5 users initially and likely no more than 10 in the foreseeable future, I'm questioning whether this office really needs a domain controller. Budget is tight so I'm trying to help as much as I can to save them money and resources.
 All users will have Office 365 accounts, so they will have access to Azure Active Directory. Microsoft gives a nice discount for non-profits, so that certainly helps!
 What's your experience with small offices? What can we leverage from Azure Active Directory to remove the need to an on-site server acting as a domain controller. What about print servers?

I know it's not ideal, but our funding comes from the Government and it's a process to get replacements - besides the fact I think there's an underlying issue since the drive shouldn't be growing like it is. The only thing installed on it is Server 2016, everything else goes to different volumes. This is a classified system, on a private network, so there's very little going on in the background, or there shouldn't be at least. I cannot use treesize or similiar applications because of the security measures in place. Does anyone have any ideas how I can find out what is continuously filling up the drive? I really don't want to have to reinstall the OS. I've done the basics such as clearing caches and disk cleanup, didn't get much help there. I imagine it's some kind of log files, but near impossible to find without the handy apps.
 Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: Just to be clear, I cannot use 3rd party apps to assist(treesize, windirstat etc), or I would have most definitely done this to start. There's a process that has to be taken to classify anything that's put on the network (This is a Goverment Top Secret network). And the mighty overseers of the network will gladly tell me to frig off and just reinstall the OS before they allow it.

 ​
 say you are denying all outbound traffic besides services that are required for a server to function, per your software vendor you create some firewall objects (*.SASvendor.com) and create an l3 rule to allow traffic to said vendor. If I were to do an nslookup to get a hostname from that IP that the software is communicating with it resolves a AWS datacenter address, but if I know the address that it is communicating with say... (prod1.SASvendor.com) it resolves to to that IP. I assumed that when the firewall is asked to resolve the DNS record it becomes aware of the FQDN and says ok yep that is good, but my DNS server is not forwarding DNS to the firewall, so how does the firewall know that an IP address is part of the *SASvendor.com domain? I create the rules and it works but I just like to understand how this works..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am making good progress on my crusade to remove Windows XP from the shopfloor of the plant.
 However, some computers give me trouble as they are running 16-bit software, on 32-bit XP (and obviously, the software company is long gone, and replacing millions of dollars worth of heavy machinery because the computer shipped with it is too old is not a possibility)
 Moving forward, I can see two ways of doing this: * Windows 10 32 bit, taking advantage of NTVDM to run the app almost natively, but it feels like running straight into the wall, 32-bit OSs are clearly or the future.
  
Using some kind of emulator, like winevdm, to run the application on 64 bit OS, but I am not sure how business ready this tool is, and how reliable it can be for business critical applications.
  
Do you have some feedback you can share ?

 When I decide to look into their prices, I noticed that they have a section for "IT DEPARTMENTS" instead of MSPs. The prices for MSPs show as 5 users minimum whereas for IT Departments it does not say a minimum amount of users (see screenshot). 
 I decide to give them a call (book a demo), and they tell me that for 1 user, the price is $99 / month and they can go as low as $59 / month. None of these prices are shown in the website. See it for yourself -- https://www.itglue.com/it-department/
 Any alternative that you could suggest?

 I'm trying to come up with some ideas on how to handle the annoying tasks that require me to go in office.
 For some background, I'm the sole sysadmin of a <100 person company. We've been mostly WFH since covid, I come into the office when I need. They have been trying to get people to come back 2 days a week, but I haven't seen too many people abide by it. I absolutely dread going into the office, especially as of late. I'm temporarily living about 1.5 hours away from the office with regular traffic and even though I don't go in often, it's slowly draining me. Other than that and the general office time wasters/chit chat, I enjoy the job and people I work for. It's pretty laid back and I get to implement the things I want for the most part.

 We will be in the range of 50 users, 100 - 125 devices (laptop, desktop, mobile and then some) and about 5 to 7 servers. Would like to have reporting on user or device when needed. Open to looking at any platform. Thanks!

 I've also found that you might be able to use SELinux to do something similar ? I am not experienced enough so if anyone know about a good tutorial about SELinux and apps / users restrictions i would gladly take it as i haven't find any satisfying post on the matter yet.

 This is on a Dell PowerEdge R620 server. These servers usually don’t come with a dedicated GPU so in Microsoft for the display card is says “Basic Microsoft Display Adapter”. 
 The Linux installer has a GUI so I’m theory when it boots it should load. I searched the Internet and found out it’s probably a display adapter issue, with most of the “fixes” being to update or install graphics drivers…but I don’t have an nvidia or whatever graphics card to install drivers for. I checked the XFCE server and saw this error (attaching image to this post). 
 https://i.postimg.cc/02gDsq5Q/86-E5976-C-64-EE-44-E2-8452-FC62-E47152-AA.png
 Windows is all up to date, all drivers are good. Upon installing Linux I can do Ctrl alt F3 and get to the CLI to check this stuff. Basically - Kali boots but after the Kali logo (before the log in screen) it just goes to a black screen with a flashing “-“ in the top left. 
 I’ve done these commands sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install update sudo apt install upgrade
 I’ve tried restarting XCFE with the startxfce4 command and then I see the error that it won’t start. I check the log and that’s where I found that error in the screenshot. I’ve reinstalled Kali multiple times to no avail.

 Occasionally, and intermittently, Twingate reports that it cannot connect to these IP's on these ports and suggests the ports are blocked. The remote site is within a serviced office. We operate our own firewall, which is connected to some internal/unknown networking at the serviced office, which is handed off to the local carrier. We have a publicly routable IP addresses on our firewall.
 Is there a way to find out which upstream device is blocked these ports?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ok, so we need a mobile network that we can transfer all the time. So my idea was to get Mikrotik Chateau LTE18 as a router, Ubiquiti Networks U6-PRO for the access point, and Cloud Key Gen2. With that would get small UPS to plug it all in that and a small rack to store it.
 ​
 What do you guys think, is that going to withstand 40-50 devices at the same time? Once we get on location we are fixed, and we need our network for all users and their tablets (40-50). Was also thinking about getting some additional LTE antenna if we lack signal quality.
 ​
 Problem is that I read about the chateau sometimes just stop working and needs to be restarted, never used it myself so I'm not sure how reliable is it?

 happy new year!
 Wondering if others have stumbled across this issue:
 We have a script in our environment that reads IP Ranges from a Sharepoint list to add it to the Named Locations in Azure for our CA-Policies.
 The Azure AD Cmdlet for this is:
 Set-AzureADMSNamedLocationPolicy (AzureAD) | Microsoft Learn 
 The cmdlet replacing it is:
 Update-MgIdentityConditionalAccessNamedLocation (Microsoft.Graph.Identity.SignIns) | Microsoft Learn 
 However, the cmdlet doesn't allow to add IP Ranges, at least there is no parameter for it.
 Used this link to find the cmdlet map:

 I've packaged some updates / applications in pkgx files using configuration manager, and sent them to the site on a USB drive. But when I try to extractcontent.exe /P:C:\prestage\stuff.pkgx it uncompresses but then doesn't extract. Upon checking the PrestageContent.log it keeps failing with error "SetObjectSecurity failed; 0x8007051b". 
 It runs on an elevated cmd, user is a member of Administrators on the server. I've even tried setting up a fresh dummy DP on a virtual PC and repeated the same thing but I get the same error there too. The dp is "configured for prestaged content" and I am running out of ideas. 
 Anyone here experienced something similar? I've tried googling the error message, seems to be related to admin rights, but I get zero hits on SCCM related errors. I've tried doing this using the local admin account, domain admin account and other members of the Administrators group on the server. The folders on the site all seem to be owned by "administrators" so I don't see why this fails...

 i got a request from a customer regarding a special use case, he wants to integrate Devices without Wifi Capabilities in a existing Campus WiFi, it will be around 60 Devices.
 The Campus WiFi is authenticating with 802.1x with certificates, the certs should be managed from one central Controller.
 Is there any Vendor that offers APs that can operate as Clients and integrate in a already existing WiFi or is offering WiFi Bridges that can be managed from a Controller?
 I found the Aruba 501 Wireless Bridge, which seems to offer everything we need, but i am not sure if it is manageable from any kind of controller.

 So I am not sure if I am doing it wrong or just not supported (and need to come up with a workaround, I do have other options- including adding a line or 2 into my c# app to create the key on app start).
 So I have a custom-built app that uses a custom URL schema. I am able to register it etc into the registry so someone can type in "coolapp://blah" in start-> run or by clicking on a link in their favourite browser and it would fire up my app and pass on prams etc.
 Now what I need to do is allow Outlook desktop app to open those links without getting this "Microsoft Outlook Security Notice - Microsoft Office has identified a potential security concern." message.
 I can add the custom url schema key in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Security\Trusted Protocols\All Applications" and Outlook won't complain anymore for the current logged user.
 Now when I went to put that same key under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Security\Trusted Protocols\All Applications" (and remove the one in HKEY_CU) I am finding that Outlook is not picking up the key under HKEY_LM and starts complaining again.
 Am I trying to do something that is not supported or am I putting it in the wrong place?
 I followed this: https://superuser.com/questions/1365501/office-365-ver-1809-how-do-i-specify-trusted-protocols and it got me 1/2 way there - ideally I would like to set it global and be done with it.
 Running GPRESULT /H GPReport.html brings up nothing and gpupdate /force and rebooting didn't help.
 Cheers

 Your computer can't connect to the remote computer because the Remote Desktop Gateway server address requested and the certificate subject name do not match. Contact your administrator for assistance. When I view the certificate, it shoes the valid remote.mydomain.com certificate.

 ​
 Apparently VP saw this somewhere, but I do not think this is possible in vanilla windows 10 LTSC. But I am never going to hear the end of it for the next like week so I thought should through it out into the void and see if it rings a bell for anyone.
 I am pretty sure they were seeing some sort of TV with multiple inputs for each quadrant or they loaded 3rd party software to do it even though they shouldn't where they saw it.

 The environment that I work at is using VMware Volumes to deploy web applications such as Chrome, Edge, Etc. I have an application that is installed on the golden image that calls upon the default browser to auto start a web Applicaiton. The instructions stated to put the program installed on the golden image in the "Startup" folder which would normally launch the application. VMware Volumes is not instant and i know that so instead i made a scheduled task to start the program 90 seconds after the initial login (It doesn't actually take 90 seconds for Chrome to appear). The scheduled task runs as the "BuiltIN\Users" group which i assumed would take on whoever actually is logged in sort of like a wild card. I am finding that the application will launch and launch fine when clicking on the desktop icon, but when its ran from the scheduled task it doesn't work properly.
 Is there some other group I can use that would assume the logged in user? Yes i considered writing a simple powershell script or batch script, however both of those are blocked as per domain policy.

I recently started a new position, the interviews went really well, I got detailed information about the department I would be managing and the unique needs it has. I was offered a significant pay increase (think 30-35%). However, I have now heard from both my new supervisor and another source I trust that the position is going to be changed- instead of managing IT for a small department, I would be managing someone doing that role as well as the larger groups main help desk.
 This was never mentioned in the interviews, and isn't something I'm interested in. I had several other offers on the table while searching last year, and have been approached for a number of other positions since accepting this one. I'm torn. On one hand it feels incredibly inconsiderate to immediately turn around and leave...but I was deceived about the true role I would be in. 
 Anyone been here before? Any advice?

I need to re-setup everything as I want to start using VLAN's. However after reading all the horrible things abut their business practices on deploying firmware upgrades, I don't feel comfortable paying $29 a month for the cloud controller. 
 I've been reading that the Aruba Instant On AP's are good. How are they for someone whose actually a network admin vs just some person who wants an easy to setup WLAN? I'd go with meraki ones if I was actually going to keep the meraki after expiration, but I want to get rid of that piece of garbage. 
 As for size, we currently have about 8,512 SF office space with most of it being open concept with some people in offices. Currently 20 people but planning on growing. Also possibly opening multiple locations world wide so would like to easily control these. 
 Would the Aruba Instant On's be good for this or should I look at something a bit more enterprise? Growth and security are top priority for me.

 The policy based VPNs tunnel ALL traffic back to the datacenter, including Internet. This is done with an ACL like:
 permit ip 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 Our route based VPNs only tunnel a handful of subnets back to the datacenter. We have static routes like:
 ip route 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 Tunnel0
 My question is how would I convert our policy based VPNs into a route based VPN when ALL traffic should be tunneled? If I create an ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Tunnel0 statement, it would break the current default route for our routers to get to the next hop, which is the ISP router.

Remember how like 70% of the team moved out of state to be closer to family or find a lower cost of living since we haven't bothered to give cost of living increases that even remotely keep up with inflation? Remember how with the extremely rare exception of a hardware failure you haven't even seen the server hardware you work on in nearly 3 years? Well have I got good news for you! 
 We have some new executives and they like working in the office because that's how their CEO fathers worked in 1954 and he taught them well. Unfortunately with everyone working from home they feel a bit lonely. There is nobody in the building for them to get a better parking place then. Nobody for them to make nervous as they walk through the abandoned cubicle farms. There is also a complete lack of attractive young females at the front desk for them to subtly harass. How can they possibly prove that they work the hardest if they don't see everyone else go home before them each evening?
 To help them with their separation anxiety we will now be working in the office again. If you moved out of state I am sorry but we will be accounting for that when we review staff for annual increases and promotion opportunities, whatever those are. New hires will be required to be from the local area so they can commute and cuddle as well. 
 Wait, hold on one sec, my inbox keeps dinging, why do I have 12 copies of the same email? Oh I see They are not all the same, they just all have the same subject line. Wait! you can't all quit! Not at the same time. Oh good Bob, you were in the office today, wait what's this? Oh Come on, a postit note? You couldn't even use a full sheet of paper?

 Should I just replace them all out-of-hand as a few seem to have already failed?

 Question: Looking for an affordable, but easy to manage switch/platform that will provide me with a completely redundant network configuration.
 Topology: 
 |--------Primary Router------Switch-----|
 ISP Switch | X | |--------NAS, Hypervisor
 |---------Backup Router------Switch-----|
 NOTE: Routers have connections to both switches, and switches have connections between each other. This is the only way I can think to be redundant in the event that 1 switch goes down. I don't have a fully VRRP router setup, just online/standby. One router has to go down completely before the second kicks in.
 ​
 Additional Background:
 I have a iXSystems X20 NAS with 2 controllers running on my network. I have been running into issues where the NAS will freak out and drop all connections when there is a change on the local network (switch firmware update or VLAN changes). I am currently using a UniFi Switch Aggregation switch to connect the NAS to my ESXi hypervisors.
 I am hoping to solve this issue, but I am not familiar with every redundancy technology. I know I will probably need to purchase other switches, but need to know where to start looking and what other people have in their setups.

 ​
 At first I was able to factory reset the router and go into the initial configure boot menu options, then from there I loaded a new IOS image on to the flash, but after I deleted the old versions of the flash I am unable to factory reset and get back into the initial configure options.
 Below is the set command output:
 LICENSE_SERIAL_NUMBER=FTX2116Z09V LICENSE_PRODUCT_ID=IR829GW-LTE-VZ-AK9 RET_2_RTS=20:13:16 UTC Wed Dec 14 2022 LICENSE_BOOT_LEVEL= BOOT_IOS_SEQUENCE=0 RANDOM_NUM=87409147 BSI=0 RET_2_RCALTS= LICENSE_SUITE= BOOT_STRING_IOS=?

 Here is the output from dir command :
 flash: pnp-tech-time pnp-tech-discovery-summary txw90r2-confg vlan.dat managed eem ir800-universalk9-bundle.SPA.159-3.M6a.bin 
 When attempting to boot system from flash I receive this error:
 Booting image: system.... Error 15: File not found 
 Despite my dir command showing that the desired file is there.
 I am awaiting a new rommon package to be sent to me, but without being able to boot rommon mode 2, I am not sure how I would apply the new package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. My company is increasingly leveraging the cloud to the point where I believe a full migration from on-prem is not far round the corner. Just as an overall point of discussion, what is the general approach to take when migrating from on-prem at multiple offices around the world to, say, Azure? For example, we have 2 offices on the east and west coast in the US and 3 offices in Asia. Is it advisable to have a separate VNet for each office or would you setup VNets for multiple offices in generally the same geographical area? Interested to know people's thoughts...

 Me: Does that mean that $user is no longer with us?
 HR: Yes, $user's last day was 3 FUCKING WEEKS AGO (emphasis mine). We asked them to get with you to return their equipment!
 Me, fighting through an aneurysm: There are no receipt emails in $user's account. However, there is an exchange between you and $user where you signed off on using $user's personal email for the subscription.
 HR: I'm aware of that exchange. Thanks for checking.
 So, to recap:
  
All of $user's accounts have been active for 3 weeks since their departure.
 I have no idea where user's equipment is.
 HR is co-signing subscriptions tied to personal email addresses.

 But this keeps happening.
 I am part time IT support for a location as the ownership is still too damn cheap to transition me to full time hours and benefits despite our business picking up after Covid.
 So I work my three days and have been for over a year.
 But dumbasses on site who got a hold of my number as management shared it like chickenpox call me at all hours of the day "Taco are you on site?, Taco are you working today ?, Taco have you seen the ticket I submitted 3 nanoseconds ago (if they even send in a ticket) ? Taco something IT knows is a issue but they keep getting denied the budget to fix is broken , what's your backup plan ? "
 ​
 Its freaking frustrated none of them seem to have any respect for my private life, 3 times this morning I was woken up while still in bed (now to be fair one of those was Oracle (and that's its own rant that they don't seem to ever check time zones for gods sakes )), i get called at like 2AM by the night shift staff and there's no empathy there, no apology for waking me up in the dead of the night, instead "why are you always so grumpy when I call? "
 I don't know jackass, maybe its because its been a long week and I am trying to sleep and you call me for your petty shit!!!
 ​
 Sigh...I need to get out of that place, its going to kill me with stress if I let it out.
 And I will smile and laugh as things go to hell without me there, as the only other IT person for the organization is 2 hours drive away with good traffic. Not the location, the Organization, a organization with locations on 2 continents.
 That is how goddamn cheap they are.
 What about the rest of you, anyone else got cases of being treated like crap with your phone and personal life ?

The upload technology works like this, dedicated fiber till a street OLT, then pon branches to the office, downstream is multicast (not 100% sure, but I don't care cause I don't have problems) while upstream is in TDM, configured on the OLT, with one slot for each customer in the PON tree. Do any of you have experienced similar issues with TDM technologies? Or single session tcp issues? I've already broke down the issue to this, so no latency/BDP/matis etc issues

Currently, i'm working on a project to put as many of our systems as possible through our Duo Network Gateway (DNG from here forward). 
 The end goal is to put every administrative interface behind the DNG while we implement Zero Trust. (Being inside or outside the org doesn't mean I trust you, there is no inherently trusted device.) To reach a device you first need to use a MFA secured portal to verify your identity. 
 As part of this we are attempting to move our VMWare vSphere web interface behind our DNG, it appears natively this is not supported so we are first going through a NGINX reverse proxy to present a single supported web interface.
  
Here is the config needed in NGINX to make this work for all parts of vSphere…]]></summary>

Over the Christmas period BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and even Prime video started blocking all devices on our network from accessing content. On all services I get messages saying we are either not in the UK or using a VPN. We are based in the UK with a static IP address from a UK based ISP. We don't send our traffic out through a proxy server or a VPN at all (although we do have one remote user who gets into our network through a VPN to our Router). Does anyone know what it is about our IP address or network that would cause this? Any ideas why we are getting flagged and how to fix would be appreciated.

 The logs look like below
 Dec 30 18:48:04.400 UTC: %SEC_LOGIN-1-QUIET_MODE_ON: Still timeleft for watching failures is 0 secs, [user: foo] [Source: 192.168.1.5] [localport: 443] [Reason: Login Authentication Failed - BadPassword] [ACL: sl_def_acl] at 13:48:04 
 Here's the thing though, we are a strictly class A 10.0.0.0/8 network. There isn't a single 192.168.1.0/24 network in our enterprise. So I'm kinda stumped on how this is happening and what I should do. 
 I think I'd like to just turn on having 443 available for login, because I don't really use it.
 Thoughts?

Used their stupid SARA tool to uninstall and reinstall
 Updated the registry to force modern authentication
 Fully updated the machines
 Removed the "work or school" profile
 New user profile and new email profile.

Mid morning today it started showing as offline on all PCs, despite us being able to access it's web GUI and ping it. We were able to add it again via WSD, but not via IP. After some googling we found that changing it over to from RAW to LP and a few other settings fixed it.
 I'm curious as to why there might be a sudden change. I thought an over the air update to printer, but can't see anything in it's logs to suggest that might be it?

 I tried to go through the FQDN specifying the domain but no improvement.. The nslookup and the tracert is ok.
 I imagine Windows recently made an update that caused this malfunction..?

 I cut off the ends of the cables and have been struggling to terminate them correctly. My uncle says it’s impossible and that I used the wrong cable …I’m determined to terminate these without having to run new wires…
 He claims the gauge of the wires in the flat cable are too small and that the rj45 connector pins won’t bite fully into them when they’re crimped. This seems to be the case because every time I terminate one, the results on the tester keep changing.
 Is there any way I can terminate these ?! Is there a special rj45 connector I’ve never heard of?
 Thanks so much!

 From what I've read and experienced it seems like Dell is the only brand that is not easy to work with when it comes to non-warranty repairs. (If you are certified under the Dell TechDirect program, Dell will ship parts for warranty and Dell ADP claims) If Chromebooks are outside of warranty Dell has processes in place that try to steer school districts to sales to buy new Chromebooks. If sales are pressed for a quote for parts they purposely make it ridiculously high.

However, this has led to hundreds of Audit Failures per minute on nearly every endpoint. When checking the Event Viewer I see it's mainly for Teams and Edge (errors below).
 These logs are filling up a lot of space in Splunk, and so our security asked us to track down the cause. I've seen this come up a lot online, but the only real solutions I've seen is to turn off auditing, but that will then flag us for not following STIG.
 Hoping someone has found a proper resolution to this issue, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my wife and I were looking for a project to work that we could leverage to possibly help us in our business and upskill some of our SWE skills. We have begun to try and centralize our organization's (and other organizations that we work with) communication and kind of command center on Microsoft 365 and specifically Teams, but augmented by the whole ecosystem. In our opinion, it makes things simpler for many users, and we have been decently happy with Microsoft products over other vendors.
 We decided to develop a ticketing system/helpdesk software. Obviously this is a crowded space, but we could only find one other option that allowed you to work with the tool in any serious way inside of Teams. We are planning to add some other features that may be less focused on with the bigger brands as well, but overall it will be a simple, affordable, SaaS that can be utilized through a web browser on our standalone site OR entirely through Teams - for both the technicians and the end-users.
 This started out (and has been a great success!) as just wanting to build something that we would at least use and that we could learn from. However, as we build it out more - I am wondering if:
  
This is something you or anyone you know would actually use/like? 
 What additional features would you love to see in a product like this?
 Would you pay for it?
  
Appreciate your thoughts, have a good day!

 I'm looking for a solution for creating forms - mainly for manual check-ups on hardware and software.
 I have tried Acrobat Pro DC, but it seems rather tedious and the text-formatting is unstable, at least when I edit or try to move text-fields and so forth.
 Essentially what I am looking for:
 - Offline (If possible)
 - If/Else (Example: Ability to hide text-fields unless a checkbox is checked)
 - Export to PDF when filled.
 - Easier scripting for the if/elses?
 I thought an interactive PDF would be the easiest way to accomplish this, does anyone know any better or is Acrobat perfectò?
 We have M365, can is Microsoft Forms good enough for this?
 Greets!

 im a sysadmin (mostly windows) and my coding is mostly limited to powershell, although i learned a bit of C a long time ago and dabbled with C#.
 Now i want to develop a small tool that does the following:
 - running as a service on a windows machine- accept commands (via REST-API would be best i think?)- execute PowerCLI Cmdlets (Powershell)
 Im not really well versed in .NET programming. My first instinct was to write a Powershell-Script and let it run as a service by a tool like nssm or use something like Powershell Universal. Then i found out you can run ASP.NET core in a windows service. Not shure how to execute powershell from this though.
 Maybe someone has advice about which technique would be the best for my task? Or maybe there is a framework or tool that already does what i want?
 /edit
 Ok here is what i want to do:
 We have a monitoring system that can do rest calls. When the status of certain monitored asset changes i want it to send a rest call to my service. When all of the monitored assets are down, i want my service to shut down specific VMs through powercli.

 Admins have quite high privileges to servers. As Microsoft best practice suggests, their domain user (domain.com\admin) high privilege account which they use logging to PAW has no local Administrator privileges.
 Now there is situation when those same level/tier PAW-s need to be managed/administered by some of the same level admins. For example execute Powershell scripts on those PAW-s remotely, access ADMIN$ shares, etc... Looks like another domain user (domain.com\paw_admin) is needed for them which has to be inside domain group (domain.com\paw_administrators) which is member of local Administrators group. Nobody wants to have many MFA tokens.... Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have set up private endpoint for various Azure resources (SQL Server, Web Apps etc.) and set up conditional forwarding to the Azure wire server within our DNS configuration.
 A ping resolves to the private IP of the server (i.e. that of the private endpoint) when testing from Azure VM's within the VNET, but when testing from local machines, it seems to flip flop between returning the private IP and returning the public azure endpoint, meaning I can sometimes connect through to these resources from my machine (when the private IP is being returned) and sometimes not (when the public IP is being returned).
 We have our local machines pointing at Cisco Umbrella for their DNS resolution already, and have therefore opted to have the relevant azure endpoints forward onto our VM-based DNS servers using Umbrella's in-built DNS forwarding capabilities. 
 If I test through this method I can replicate the issue, if I override this method using my hosts file (pointing the relevant URL's directly at their private endpoint IP address), it works consistently, suggesting the issue is with Cisco Umbrella, and it is not consistently handling the requests.
 Any ideas on how to resolve this?

 I currently have a portacabin set up with a slow (4-7 Mbps) DSL line and I am looking for advice on the best way to upgrade it. My options have been presented as follows:
 1) point to point wireless connection - this could be an effective way of connecting portacabin to base office but I am concerned that the large ships around the operation could adversely affect the connection.
 2) Ethernet circuit (leased line) - I have been advised this is a costly option.
 3) Starlink connection. Not a great match with our current Watchguard Firewall as it's a bit of a pain to configure but is probably one of the better options in my opinion.
 Interested to hear what professionals/experts have to say about the above. Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Reaching out here as my Google-fu seems insufficient for getting my head wrapped why and how this is happening.
 We run RDS farms with RDGateway/RDBroker services. Recently we decided to decommission some of the older RDGW servers as they were unstable and poorly documented, and set up new ones.
 They work as expected, except for the fact that a handful of end users somehow have created full local user profiles on the new RDGW servers... It seems to be completely random, and it's only about 8-10 accounts out of thousands that access the farms. The profiles are empty, and they have functioning/actual profiles on their respective collection session hosts. Creation date is between 0-4 days from when the new RDGW servers were put into production, and no new profiles have appeared since.
 Anyone know what could cause this? Any setting in user object and/or collection(s) that might trigger this behavior?
 Any help appreciated.

 I am running an Ubuntu 20.04 VM with 16 cores as Graylog server (Java).
 The strange thing is, that the reported CPU usage of "top" is wrong.

 --> 2,1 cores at 100%, but total usage only 1,2%
 At 16 cores, it should be around 13%
 ​
 Do you have any idea about the origin of that difference?

 I hope that everyone has a good new year.
 I was wondering If I could get feedback from the community about my resume.
 Currently I'm looking for a remote Linux sysadmin or possible a junior DevOps position in Europe.
  
I am currently getting my CKS and an AWS certificate. Should I put them in my resume and saying that I'm currently pursuing them or would you advice not to?
 I spoke with a recruiter and he said that my projects are not "mature" enough, I asked for feedback but didn't hear anything back. What would be considered a "mature" project in your eyes?
 Did I list to many projects? I have a portfolio but I noticed that no one was looking on it.
 Would you think I could get a remote job in the United States as a 1099 contractor or is that to early?
  
Again, thank you for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a but of a mystery regarding my network, where devices in my network are not capable of accessing a web service which is outside the network, on port 80/443. The service is otherwise reachable from everywhere else (my home network, LTE, etc.).
 The network has 1000 IP's on the same subnet and all devices in the network are behind a Debian firewall running iptables. All outgoing traffic is allowed and likewise for established connections.
 In particular, I have no problem reaching other instances of the same service on those ports from devices in the network. To my knowledge there is no iptables rule that precludes accessing the web service from my network.
 When I run tcptraceroute from a device within network, the tail of the trace is identical to running it from a device outside of the network with the exception that the last hop to the server with the web service is missing. To me this points to the packet being dropped by the server.
 Does this point to a misconfigured iptables on my end or could the problem be that the packets are rejected by the server running the web service when it belongs to my IP range? Everything has worked fine until recently. Port scan shows it runs IIS and only ports among top 1000 that are open are 80 and 443.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a school system, and foolishly installed the December updates before I left for Christmas break. I didn't notice any issues immediately, and honestly, I'm not sure if the updates are even related.
 I run Windows 2022 Server on Dell hardware. I have 3 Hyper-V VMs on that. A domain controller that does DHCP and DNS, a storage server, and a "support" system that I use for troubleshooting. The support system will not get a DHCP address from the server, which is connected to the same virtual switch.
 I read about the issues with the Dec update and Hyper-V, but I thought it was for newly created VMs. I went ahead and applied the OOB patch to the host anyways, but no luck. I then uninstalled the updates, no luck. I had DHCP failover setup, so I removed that, no luck. Thinking that maybe something with my scopes was corrupted, I loaded a backup, no luck.
 The odd thing is that the server gets the request, assigns an IP, which shows up in the leases, but the support system never receives the IP. I do have firewall enabled on the server, but outbound shouldn't be blocked. I can use our Meraki switches to give out DHCP addresses, and the support system gets that with no issue. I can ping the DHCP server if I set an IP on the support system. I have 11 servers, 9 of them appear to have this issue, but all were updated at the same time (I think the other two are working, but haven't worried about those until I figure the others out). I actually may have fixed one of them, doing the above...but doing the same to another server didn't help. So I'm thinking it was a fluke, or I didn't find the right combo.
 I'm hoping someone has seen something similar, and can point me in the right direction.
 Thanks

 That was one of the worst stretches of on-call I ever had, it was with a mid-sized company that had a shit infrastructure and poor management that was always in react mode and slapping bandaids on everything instead of fixing it. I wasn't even a sysadmin there, but my jobs would get impacted every time they had an outage that would have me spending a couple of hours figuring out what data was janked up. That was also the shortest stint of any job I worked, in and out in less than a year but I was called after hours every freaking week.

 I've been in IT for about 25 years, I am thoroughly a Generalist, but the last 15 years has been SysAdmin / IT Manager with maybe 15% time in the field- racking new gear, replace a few AP's, pull a few Cat 6 drops. I've done maybe 1000 terminations in my time. So I don't consider myself an expert when it comes to structured cabling and termination.
 I am preparing to help a church do a network reset and need some advice on some particulars. Up until a couple months ago I would not have told you that I had a preferred brand of Cat5e / Cat6 keystone jack, but on that job I had to terminate a dozen Cat 6 cables to jacks and was provided Panduit brand jacks. I felt like they were easier for me to terminate than anything I had used before.
 With that being said I wonder if you experienced folks have a preferred brand or model of jack? I estimate there will be around 150 keystone terminations to do with the church job, and I will be installing these into modular (blank) patch panels.
 I would like to try out the JackRapid tool, and see that it has versions for many different jacks, anyone have good or terrible experience with the tool itself? 
 Does anyone know the practical differences between Leviton 5g108 vs 5g110? 
 Is there any reason to consider Cat5e these days or should I just go straight to Cat6? Is there a cable brand that is preferred, with regards to colors being clear and easy to see, cable not too bulky, etc?
 Thanks for any advice!

 I'm writing our building management about this problem and telling them these are my concerns but are there any building codes, or legal requirements to put this equipment in a room that's access controlled or at least locked enclosures so it's not just exposed to anyone walking down our halls I can use to back up my concerns?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 When you see a DKIM signing, you see a that a particular domain has signed the email.
 However, from where the domain in the “d=“ is taken from? 
 Is it like the SPF, which points to the Return-Path domain?(envelope from(SMTP Mail From)? 
 Or the domain in the d= can be taken from the “Header From” as well? Though it would not make any sense because then every domain that will be attempted to spoof, we see it’s DKIM signature.
 So whenever a message has been signed with a DKIM of a particular domain, and let’s say that the DKIM header was not “added” by forging, it means that I can stay “calm” and realise that it was really sent from a valid domain because it means the return path is that domain?
 (Not including BEC)
 I know what DKIM does, I just wanted to know where that domain in the d= comes from exactly.
 Thank you

 The following processes could benefit from ERP:

 Receving
 Raw material inventory
 Part inventory
 Order review/confirmation
 Order history (for future job knowledge & estimating)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming into a new work environment and I noticed that first user logon takes about 4-5 minutes.
 I turned on Windows logon verbose logs and I noticed that the "Apply Group Policy Registries" step would take the most time to complete.
 ​
 GPOs were created originally by a third party. 
 Looking at the GPOs, I see that the third party created 100+ registry items which I assume is the culprit. These are all user policies.
 Examples of Registry items that are being deployed via GPO:
 (Note: 95% of these GPOs are set to run Apply One and do not reapply)
 Windows Icon Size
 Startup Page
 TaskbarAnnimations
 ​
 My thinking is to write a powershell script or create a .REG file and import these settings into the Default User registry Hive to save time.
  
Is this (manually adding the registries to the default user) the best approach to mitigate the slow logon time caused by lots of GPO registry items
 If I manually make these changes (powershell, .REG), and still keep the GPO Registry items, will the group policies see that the key, item already exists and skip the step, or will it just continue to run and apply the registries (write over my work)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This probably isn't a true /r/sysadmin worthy request ... but I'm hoping another admin has run into this before.
 Long background exists but the short story is that the former owner of the company was allowed to keep his company email for a lot longer than it should have been allowed. As a result he is now an over 70 year old gentleman and dependent on everything remaining as close to the same as possible. We have multiple insurance/regulatory/compliance requirements that say we need him migrated off ASAP. Current mailbox is in on-prem exchange ... size is roughly 15gb.
 My original plan was to have him get a gmail address, export his mailbox to a PST file and ship it to him to use inside Outlook. He flipped out that he wouldn't have his *extensive* folder organization system available on all his PCs/mobile devices like he does now. Current owner wants me to find a solution that would make it work with the least amount of friction possible.
 So thats the backstory ... now to solutions ... I'm open to anything that gets this resolved with the least amount of a 70 year old swearing at me and my helpdesk tech. 
 Can we upload his PST file into Office 365 Business either manually or through some wizard? Even just folder copying for him if need be.
 Any slicker solution you can think of?

 -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate DNAT -j ACCEPT
 it means that it accepts packets that have had their destination address updated by the NAT, but im confused about when the NAT updates the destination address.
 Say this is the NAT table:
 NATed Address NAT-host Address Destination Address 192.168.1.2:53452 x.x.x.x:53452 8.8.8.8:53 
 the x.x.x.x would be the public address of the NAT router.
 So if the NAT receives a packet with destination x.x.x.x:53452, does it ONLY update the destination IF the source address of the packet is 8.8.8.8:53? What if its 8.8.8.8:2000? What if its 1.2.3.4:8000, but still destined for x.x.x.x:53452?

 ​
 Real SysAdmins don't eat quiche. They like Twinkies, Coke, and palate-scorching Szechwan food.
 Real SysAdmins don't write application programs. They program right down to the base-metal. Application programming is for dullards who can't do automation.
 Real SysAdmins don't write specs. Users should be grateful for whatever they get; they are lucky to get support at all.
 Real SysAdmins don't comment their scripts. If it was hard to write, it should be even harder to understand and modify.

 I work for a large company with a not so huge corporate network footprint. It's not medical, it's not government. But they have to work or we potentially lose a ton of money. We manage about 8 FortiGate firewalls in our realm and I just do not see eye to eye with the other engineer.
 So this persons process is this: We have 6 versions to go through to get the version we want. These are important firewalls as far as our traffic flow goes and all have HA redundancy.
 The engineer will backup and compare configs and run tests after each firmware update. That means 6 times we do this to ONE firewall before we reach the version we want. 48 times all together for the whole network.
 On each incremental update we test all functionality, then let it "run" like that for a day or two, fill out a checks form then upload our configs then do it again for the next incremental update.
 Am I losing my mind here? Why are we not doing incremental upgrade, run a config comparison then upgrade to the next until we are done and then do our final checks on the final revision. It would take an hour instead of a week. Am I being too relaxed? I've probably upgraded thousands of these things in my life but this is the first time I seen someone do this so manually and labor intensive and slow. Everything this person does is done manually with a mouse and a gui.
 How would you handle this knowing a zero day vulnerability has been exposed? Does anyone do it to this tedious of a process?
 Open to convo and opinions on the process. This isn't the first time I've disagreed but I want to hear your experience be it fortigate or Cisco or whatever.

In either situation, traffic will be traversing through a third party's network (a service provider)... and isn't the whole idea that you don't want these third parties to be able to see/alter your traffic?
 The internet would pose a greater risk, of course (with traffic traversing many different service providers as opposed to just one... potential for BGP shenanigans too)... but, the risk still seems to be there with MPLS.

 However, in the classic version of Exchange (ECP), the access appears as given. This has been happening for a few months now with some mailboxes, but there isn't exactly a pattern.
 Does anyone have any idea what it could be?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a small linux shop, but unfortunately we have one proprietary application with an SQL Server on a windows box. This box sometimes has problems but unless someone logs into the machine remotely and pulls up EventViewer we don't get notified. We don't have a dedicated monitoring system, just some cron jobs which send out email.
 I looked into various tools but nothing really convinced me. I have only basic requirements right now: get windows events, filter out the few we're interested in from the application, and make them available, e.g. a CSV file on a share.
 Recommendations for this scenario greatly appreciated.
 And have a happy new year!

 A main Mikrotik1 is connected by SFP to another Mikrotik2 that would act as the core equipment of the fibers, on the SFP1 of the Mikrotik1 6 VLANs are created.
 In the Mikrotik2 all the SFP ports are on a bridge, within the bridge created 1 VLAN to manage my equipment, then a DHCP Client on the VLan to obtain an IP from the Mikrotik1, it takes the IP all right.
 Now, I connect the TP-Link Omada to the Mikrotik2, there is a link through the SFP port but I can't get it to take IP, normally if you connect something else via ethernet that has DHCP Server it takes the IP automatically.
 Has anyone had experience implementing VLAN Mikrotik + TP-Link?

 i am using HP CMSL during my SCCM OSD deployment to fetch the latest version of HPIA on my new computers. This works fine.
 In the next step i am running HPIA silently to install all CRITICAL components - which is working fine as well.
 At that point i am wondering if i oversee something or if the CLI options offer less then the UI of HPIA.
 UI
 In the UI i can select for example a subset of:
  
CRITICAL
 UPDATE RECOMMENDED
 INSTALL RECOMMENDED
 ...
  
While i would like to have:
  
CRITICAL 
 UPDATE RECOMMENDED
  
but not
  
INSTALL RECOMMENDED
  
simply to avoid bloatware being added. So in the UI i can select fine-tuned what to do.
 ​
 CLI
 In the cli manual (http://ftp.ext.hp.com//pub/caps-softpaq/cmit/whitepapers/HPIAUserGuide.pdf) i can only find the following
  
ALL
 CRITICAL
 RECOMMENDED
 ROUTINE
  
so no way to differenciate between
  
UPDATE RECOMMENDED
 INSTALL RECOMMENDED
  
Am i reading it wrong or is the CLI offering less then the UI?

We do not applied November updates, and it is time to install December. As I understood, the way to make 2003 work is to create DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes registry key with one of values 0x1F, 0x1C, 0x3F
 So, I spinned a lab for a test, and there are some problems:
  
after update install, access to 2003 share by name was lost (expected). RDP login is working. Hosted application works.
 after settings DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes to one of values 0x3F, 0x1F, 0x1C login to server breaks. Both RDP and console login. 
  
It only works with default value 0x27. 
 Have anyone experienced with 2003 ? Have I missed something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been tasked with architecting an SD WAN appliance that supports bonding, automatic failover, and use of GPS location to dynamically enable/disable a WAN connection.
 The basic requirement is for the system to support up to four gigabit WAN connections and disable one or more based on GPS location. The stretch goal is for the same device to support Multipath TCP so that traffic can be routed over multiple WAN links and recombined at a cloud server.
 The purpose is for a system installed in a vehicle that can leverage multiple different WAN links (5G, Starlink, Wi-Fi) to maximize bandwidth, provide seamless failover, and disable certain WAN links (Starlink and/or 5G) when operating in areas where the service is unavailable or not approved for use.
 I have prototyped these technologies individually using a Linux PC, but I need to find a reliable hardware + software platform for a production industrial grade system. If you were tasked with such a project, what platform would you chose to build it on?

 I would like to discuss Azure Pass-through authentication. 
 My understanding is that:
 a) All password validation requests are sent to Windows Server Active Directory via Pass-through authentication, and Active Directory is the actual place where auth occurs. So, with this in place, I could run scripts against Active Directory to look for dormant/inactive user accounts that have not be used for x days, and have them removed afterwards 
 b) For AAD Guest accounts, the identity provider, or authentication system would be Azure Active Directory 
 Are my assumptions correct?

 Now a colleague of mine has come up with the idea to start using policy-based routes instead or normal routes as an extra layer of security. The idea is to use policy-based routes to specify which sources (subnets or interfaces) are routed to specific networks. His argumentation is that if you make a mistake in the firewall policy and accidentally allow too much traffic, the PBR rules will prevent the traffic to being routed to the addresses it shouldn't be allowed to reach. 
 This to me sounds like a really bad idea, and makes an already complex network more overly complex. I have never seen PBR being (mis)used for something like this. What are your thoughts about this and using PBR as a security measure instead of a tool for traffic flow management?

 We have an existing 2016 box we are going to retire. It's within one of our own networks in another region. It employs most of the STIG rules. It is domain joined.
 We use this for:
  
Jumping into routers
 Jumping into restricted VMs/Infra
  
With the new host, I have a couple of questions:
  
We're looking to move it to Azure so if anything in our network is compromised, we still have the jumphost for admin functions

 Do any of you folks have experience with Mojo? How far has it come along since the Arista acquisition?
 I know there are the big players like Aruba and Juniper Mist, but the thought of a cloud vision managed VXLAN campus + wifi is intriguing to me. Arista seems to be the best folks to do it, given their roots in DC networking. 
 PS (I'm not even going to entertain the thought of a N9K ACI fabric or a Cisco DNA campus lol)

 Before knowing this, I did a "reset root password" from digital ocean's droplet control panel. So now when I go to SSH, it will ask me to enter current password twice, and then new password twice. However, that produces an error and it will never save because the disk is full. I then go into Recovery Console, and that also does not save the new password because I am assuming the disk is full also.
 With not being able to login via SSH with any method, I am not sure how I can clear some of the system disk. Can anyone help me with this?

 I have 2x Dell PowerEdge R740 (just 1 year old) with Seagate HDDs (DL2400mm0159, SAS 10K 2.4TB) with RAID-5 (1 hot spare) configuration.
 Past few months, I've been experiencing multiple disk failures. Since Oct 2022, so far at least 10 disk failures on two different servers. 5 disk failures on each server..
 I replaced disks (when it failed), physically replaced PERC H750 RAID Controller, upgraded firmware of HDD & BIOS as well but disk failure has been happening randomly on different slots and today another one just failed. Dell Tech support says they do not perform any root cause analysis of HDD failure and does not provide me with any reason for this massive failure. 
 Any idea why disks keep failing?

 My company has tens of thousands of photos, dating back decades, scattered across local file servers, SharePoint sites, and Box accounts. After reorganization attempts from several marketing people, it has gotten to the point where people can rarely find the photos they are looking for if they don't already know exactly where to look.
 I'm looking for software that will scan the media in its existing location and build a searchable database based on the file's metadata. Ideally it could use AI to allow users to search for subject matter. I would also like it to allow things like tagging, rating, and favoriting media.
 In my searching, I have come across Digital Asset Management software, but I'm struggling to get my head wrapped around what they actually do. It seems like they are trying to be more of a wholesale replacement for a file share, but I can't really tell.
 Any advice on if software like this exists or on best practices for managing a large media catalogue with multiple users and contributors.

I’m a new sys admin at our company which is very cloud-focused and we’ll be inheriting an HPE server with Server 2019 and Hyper-V installed with 4 VMs on it. We’ll need to implement our own alerts to let us know if the Hypervisor or any of the VMs go offline. Something to note is that there is a plan in place to migrate these VMs to Azure or shut them down completely if we don’t need them within the next few months. So we’re looking for more of a cheap stopgap than anything. 
 I was thinking of setting up Azure connection monitoring to accomplish this since I see you can also monitor on premise machines. But if there’s something better available that fits this scenario, I will look into it. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our cell numbers are being leaked/bought/sold all over the place through data brokers. Where 2FA doesn't allow authenticators, I'm wondering if it's better to just have an unlisted Google Voice number as the second factor. Do you think that this would be more or less secure than using cell phone, given the possibility of SIM swapping attacks and the ton of breaches like LastPass tying accounts to data?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an individual contributor at my organization. A previous manager and I had a conversation once about pursuing a Management position vs remaining an individual contributor (Admin/ Engineer/ developer etc...) position.
 ​
 Basically it boiled down to my manager saying that remaining in technical roles can be more rewarding than going into people management type positions. Siting that high level individual contributors have high salaries than management people. I find this hard to believe. From my perspective, no manager would ever make less than their direct reports because of the mindset "They report to me, I'm high in the org chart, therefore I'm more valuable." 
 ​
 Difference between the roles aside, Is there any truth in this? Can any of the individual contributors out there confidently say their salary is higher than their manager? Was remaining a system admin more lucrative for you? For those that made the switch from an admin to a people manager, do you have direct reports that make more than you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure there are many on this sub using these "small business" switches. They're full featured, good value for money, have lifetime warranty and, most importantly, are actually shipping!
 The problem is, when you have about 100 of these switches (mix of SG300, SG350 and the new CBS350 of various sizes and PoE/non-PoE) and they all need pretty much the same configuration save for some special use access ports..... do you guys/gals use any special tools to bulk configure them?
 I've done some crude automation with DHCP Options / TFTP and a gold config file, but once you need to start tweaking the individual switch it all goes manual.
 And please don't ask me to use FindIT, or Cisco Business Dashboard, or PNP, or whatever half-baked tool Cisco decides to stick into these switches... I'd like something where I take a switch out of the box, stick it in the network, it gets autodiscovered then I can configure it and maintain it almost entirely in bulk.
 EDIT 1: I already have the initial config sorted. Like I said I can do it with a golden config file, DHCP Options and TFTP. This is fine. My question is about follow up config changes, monitoring, config backups, and individual port configurations.
 EDIT 2: Basically I’m looking for a “WiFi controller for switches” for these models. Aruba, Ruckus, Cisco Catalyst, Cambium, Meraki - they all have some form of centralised controller… I’m looking for something similar for these switch models.

 Couple this with a form that HR fills out (lol I know, but it's been working pretty well), some dynamic groups to assign licenses and you're on your way to saving the IT department a lot of time spent on setting up accounts and fixing mistakes. 
 I've tried doing this with the 'create user' step in Power Automate, and using PowerShell, this seems to be the most flexible way to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to help a company set up a voice VLAN to help with RingCentral issues and I'm having no luck getting VLANs to work.
 At this point I'd like to start from scratch and work my way up as I can't even get a simple data VLAN working correctly.
 Here's what I would like to do to start.
 There is a Sonicwall TZ370 firewall (acting as router) and a D-Link DGS-1100 switch. Modem plugs into X1 WAN port on SW. X0 Lan port on SW is plugged into port 1 on switch.
 The main company network is 192.168.1.1
 I would like to create a Data VLAN 20 at 192.168.20.1 which assigns IP address in that range when plugged into port 7 of the switch
 I have create a virtual interface in the Sonicwall (X0:V20) and assigned it 192.168.20.1 and set up a DHCP lease range, 192.168.20.2-254
 In the switch there is a default VLAN0001 with all 24 ports untagged, Native VLAN (PVID) checked, and all ports set to hybrid.
 I created a VLAN 20 Data. Here's where I get confused. What do I set port 7 as? I have tried all options. 
 When I select tagged or untagged, Internet works but I still have 192.168.1.1 address. Not sure what I'm missing.
 Any ideas? Thanks!

 Long time lurker. I've been a Sys Admin for around 6 years. I started at a small law firm, then just last May started at an MSP. I've gathered knowledge just from facing different issues at hand, but I still feel like there's a lot to learn. My question really is what paths are there for me to take to bring me to the next step/level in my career? As for my salary goal, is 160k out of the question? Or is that 10+ years away? Thank you for your input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in the new year I’ve decided I should improve the security for our Veeam Backup infrastructure by deploying a dedicated AD Domain just for the Veeam servers to live on. It got me thinking, should I also move vCenter authentication over to only using this new domain, should I point it to both domains, or should I leave it as it is on the production domain?
 Looking to minimise the chances of lateral movement within the network from bad actors by making sure compromised credentials from the production domain can’t be used to tamper / impact the backups. There’s already a bunch of physical servers acting as repositories / tape servers and a number of VMs acting as proxies and data movers(in addition to the Veeam Management VM), so adding an extra couple VMs hosted on the physical repository servers will maintain the physical separation.

Recently started a new work with a much bigger team than my previous job. While discussing with my manager about plans for outages during the holiday, he said he’s not expecting to be able to reach me not anyone. They have a small team dedicated for such outages as first responders. 
 So this holiday has been the most quiet holidays I have had for the past half a decade. No email addressing to me. No server alerts. Nothing. Feel surreal. Gave me time to binge on a few anime I missed.
 With that said. Happy holidays and new year to everyone. For those that have to work, best of luck to you all!

 So I have been thinking of doing a career change to System Administrator or Cloud Engineer/Architect and I'm wondering what my first steps should be. 
 I currently hold a bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering and a master's in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work as a Systems Engineer (not IT Systems Engineer) in the defence sector where I do various work from designing to testing of naval military equipment. I have 2 years of experience after graduation. None of my work experience is related to System Admin or Cloud Engineering. 
 I have done some research and found that I should probably start with some of the certifications listed below: 
 Solutions Architect Associate
 Solutions Architect Pro
 Data Analytics Specialist
 Azure Fundamentals
 ​
 Will getting these certifications be enough to land a job at one of these positions? Should I do anything else to stand out? Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I recently started looking into roles similar to my own after being with the same company for nearly 15 years. When I was hired 15 years ago I never negotiated (didn't have a lot of experience at the time) so every raise and promotion has been tied to my starting salary. My current salary, senior systems administrator, is $110k which for here in Ohio I've been happy with. However, after looking at very similar roles I'm seeing salaries of $120k - $135k. I don't want to leave the company I work, it's a great place to work, and the benefits are excellent. What's making me look around is simply my salary which I believe may be a bit low considering my experience.
 The company I work for has a process for adjusting salaries based on the job market. I'm not sure how to approach my boss and do this dance. A raise of 20% would put me more in line with what I'm seeing from other job listings. I'm thinking I'll need to bring in evidence to justify the pay raise but I'm not sure what sources would be best to use. Should I even bring a copy of the other job listing that shows the higher pay or would this be a mad move? I could wait to have a more concrete offer but I know that once that card is played you have to be prepared to leave if a counter offer doesn't occur.
 Thank you

 We have had remote users lose network connectivity or lose audio and microphone functionality due to unexpected driver changes for the NICs and audio hardware.
 The fix has been to manually redeploy the working driver to their system. If it’s a network driver for a remote user and they can’t get back online, we have to ship them a replacement laptop and they lose days of work.
 Is there a setting to restrict drivers to the versions were have tested and are deploying?

 Background: I have to create a solution for auto certificate enrollment for IoT drives based on a locked version OpenSSL by the vendor. We are their first customer requesting 802.1x for nac port security but don't have a preference on how to automate the enrollment /renewal of certificates. Right now it's a very manual process. We use our own internal CA for laptops/desktops with GPO and AirWatch for company iPhones (6000+). Renewal period maybe 1year,2year or 5 year depending on the intermediate Issuing CA. 
 Does any one have any experience with this? I would also use this we future developments and axis cameras. There would be over 1000 devices to start and would increase over time so must be scalable. 
 Looking for some Pointers, would keyscaler solve this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious to know what tools you're all using for network configuration management in automation. 
 The network I manage is not well connected (mobile units) and as such, many devices can be expected to be offline at one time. I've thought about using Ansible for pushing configuration changes, but given the high probability that a node is offline, I would have to develop intelligence that pushes until successful over an interval. This could get a little finicky. 
 I'm thinking of testing out a pull-based automation platform, but I don't have any experience with them whatsoever. My Ansible experience is limited to laboratory environments. I've used Nornir to backup devices, but again, hit or miss depending on what's online. I schedule this to occur once nightly at a time where I should have a decent success ratio. What would be easier? Having the configurations managed from a central automation platform and having the devices pull that down. 
 I don't yet have a Single Source of Truth developed, but I am working on this. I came into the organization with phpIPAM as our IPAM tool. It doesn't do DCIM very well whatsoever, so I'm wanting to move to something else (Infoblox, Bluecat, or NetBox if they'll let me go FOSS again). Meanwhile, I'm shopping automation platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 I don't know if it's okay to ask this in this subreddit, but since I got a lot of information regarding testing new hard drives from here, I thought I give it a shot.
 I recently purchased two Seagate Expansion Desktops (16 TB each, the one I started testing with is a ST16000NM000J model) and did a little research to check if and how I should test my new storage devices, since I'm new to this whole topic (Windows 10).
 Here is what I came up with: https://pastebin.com/HHXPsEmu 
 If somebody wants to read and / or correct me - be my guest.
 Following my research, I wanted to do a Erase Test with HDDScan on the new drive as a first step, but it immediately started listing bad blocks and doesn't stop to list them (SMART values were all okay) . Now I read on several links (Link1, Link2, Link3), that this probably is a failure of HDDScan. I tried 3 or 4 times, always starting HDDScan as admin, re-assigning the drive since it won't get detected anymore after canceling the Erase Test, turned it on and off again, turned PC on and off again, nothing seems to work. 
 Is my drive just flatout broken, does HDDScan just don't work correctly (what am I doing wrong?), is there a fix to this or what is the problem? 
 Is there any other way of doing a destructive read / write test on Windows to verify my drive, that this community recommends? I heard about badblocks, but I'm not in the mood to set up a Linux virtual machine just for this and I don't want to upgrade to a Windows 11 Developer Build just to get a functioning mount-command for WSL.
 I didn't test it with the other redundancy drive yet, but since this seems to be an error (or at least it seems to me), I did what any regular human being would do - frantically ask some dudes on reddit. I will test the other drive the following days and can update this thread, if necessary. Any help is appreciated <3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a nice simple job turned into a bit of a nightmare with nothing working.
 In the cisco corner we have a 3750 with 3 vlans (1,2,20) and in the D-Link corner we have a 1510 with the same vlans configured. Should be simple to connect them, trunk port with 2,20 on the trunk and 1 as native, then on the D-Link side a hybrid port with 1 native untagged and 2 and 20 tagged.
 Nope only vlan that passes traffic is 1 (native), so we abandon that idea and setup an access port for 2 and another for 20,sfill no dice. Only mac address learnt was the port on the dlink.
 Checked the config on the dlink in cli, nothing odd at all really quite basic. Even withy everything broken out into access ports vlan 1 was the only one that passed traffic.
 So, any ideas on this one, as I'm at a bit of a loss how something that should have been simple just failed to work as expected.
 Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In light of the recent LastPass breech I looked at different strength test websites to see how long a password would hold up under a offline brute-force attack.
 The password I tried was: Aband0nedFairgr0und 
 This is a a 19 character password with a combination of uppercase/lowercase/numbers (no special characters) 
 I went to 5 different password strength sites and they all give me wildly different results for how long it would take to crack.
 ​
  
 https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/ 9 quadrillion years 
  
 https://delinea.com/resources/password-strength-checker 36 quadrillion years 
  https://password.kaspersky.com/ 4 months 
  https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/ 1 day 
 
 As you can see the results are all over the place! 
 Can anyone recommend the best/ most upto date resource to check password strength. I am sure people with bitcoin mining farming GPUS can crunch 100s of guesses per second. 
 PS: Dont worry, Aband0nedFairgr0und is not a password I use and was made up as a test.

 I have so far used Chrome Remote Desktop and TeamViewer, but would really like something that is just a process running in the background and neither Chrome Remote Desktop or TeamViewer does this. 
 My criteria is that this must be running in the background, allow unattended access, have a central/cloud based client list (so I don't have to mess with VPN/DNS) and almost most important, be free or offer a free variant for both Windows and macOS.
 I only have two or three computers I need access to from my laptop, and sometimes from my iPhone.

        <updated>2022-12-31T09:36:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a good sized DMVPN environment with approximately 100 spokes. One of these locations, happens to be my office.
 My office in this case, has 5 x WAN links, all of which today are VDSL-class 100Mbps lines.
 My ISR's here, are 2951 HSEC+ K9 with the ISM accelerator.
 Performance is satisfactory for 100Mbps circuits, however there are some issues:
  
I am replacing the VDSL links with 3 x Fiber links, each of which is 1Gbps down, 100Mbps up.
 The machines are getting old, and my facility is the only one that must have aes256 tunnels, hence IOS 'up2date' is very important here, the 2951 is now eol.
 If I can cut down on physical equipment I will be happy
  
Downstream of the ISR's (dmvpn spokes) I use ASA5585-X's with WAN traffic zones for load balancing. Each ISR has it's own transit network with it's own /29, and therefore the ASA sees each ISR's downlink as a separate WAN
 All of this today, works very well, I could say that I'm very satisfied.
 However, with the new year coming, I need to make changes to match the new WAN links that are inbound.
 So, my question:
 Is it possible for me to purchase say a modern ASR, link 4, 5, say 6 WAN links to it directly (route to internet direct), and then with that single ASR, join my DMVPN cloud?
 Consider that the single ASR, will have a single serial number, hence a single certificate, and I'm trying to join DMVPN with a single ASR as "multiple spokes"
 The reason for this is that each WAN link needs to be encrypted by way of dmvpn, such that the transit downlink to the ASA is encrypted. The ASA knows only that he sees 4-5 WAN links, which are ultimately DMVPN spokes
 Thank you for any feedback

 I have a company computer that I am not an admin on, nor do I manage the AD domain or policies. I do, however, access to the local admin account. I have one application only that is not installing properly and installs without issue on non domain computers.
 The error I receive is,
 "This application requires a minimum of Internet Explorer 3.0 for this Operating System before installation. Please install minimum requirements and restart.
 The install will now abort."
 The machine I am on has IE 11, Edge, Chrome, and Opera GX. All of them are up to date and operational. Running as admin, disabling, re-enabling IE, booting to safe mode and forcing the installer, direct login as local admin, most everything you can think of does not solve this issue. 
 At this point I'm at a complete loss and don't even know what else I can check. I'm not even sure what group policy could be effecting this. The local admin account is also part of the Administrators group. Any help is more than greatly appreciated.

 Started as a PC tech and moved up to Sr Admin. It's public sector so the pay isn't great. I'm 60% remote with a 2hr round trip the other days.
 I love the work and the people but I'm at the ceiling, I'm at the last rung of the ladder unless my boss meets a meteor.
 And being local govt things don't change so I'd be looking at the same thing for the next 3-4 years.
 Got called back about a position 15min away. Private sector hospice center. In office for a month then 40% remote. It's not a Sr Admin but would be an increase putting me above what my current director is making.
 My main concerns are:
 They are VMware shop, my experience is with Xen/XCP, Proxmox and Nutanix.
 They are a Cisco shop, my experience is with Avaya/Extreme.
 But they looked at my resume and wanted to schedule an interview ASAP. Fingers crossed.

Boss wants to have a PC set up on location for the customers to utilize this app, so I need to get this PC (that is running normal Win11 Home) locked down.
 What I mean by locked down:
  
The PC should only allow chome to be opened in full screen, and only the application's url allowed. (All other web traffic should be blocked)
 
Users should be unable to launch any other programs (i.e. file explorer, cmd, start menu etc.). Ideally, they wouldn't even be allowed to exit chrome's full screen mode or get back to the desktop
 
Disabling keyboard shortcuts (Win+R, Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, etc.) 
 
 I'm sure this is a pretty common use case for PC's, so the answer has to exist, but I can't seem to find the right words to Google to start figuring out how to set it up. Just a bunch of chrome troubleshooting. Appreciate any advice or references to articles that would give me a push in the right direction.
 Edit 1: Thank you everyone for reminding me that "Kiosk" is a word. That's definitely what I'm looking for. The limitations by not allowing extensions is bothersome, but I might be able to reconfigure the app for Firefox.

Even though I have my Cloudkey linking the network to the office VLAN when I connect to the wifi with my ad credentials the computer receives an address on VLAN10. Where do I begin, The machine hosting AD, Radis, IIS, CA & NPS, and so on has access to the office and management VLAN. currently, the APs and NPS are communicating/authenticating over vlan10. since I don't think that ubiquity issues multiple IP's per app on each VLAN.

Is it possible to do this or will they have to forget the network and have to manually connect each time?

If it is, why wouldn't setting active/passive be the norm?

 In a hybrid cloud environment where you have your dedicated connection between the public cloud and on-premises (AWS DirectConnect, Azure ExpressRoute, Oracle FastConnect etc.) and:
  
The dedicated connection is provided by a third party service provider (not listed in the direct partner listing for the cloud provider)
 MACsec is NOT supported on your CPE
 You have to comply PCI-DSS, and you have your non-CDE communicating with your CDE over the dedicated connection
  
Do you encrypt the dedicated connection with IPsec? As in, is it normally required by PCI-DSS auditors in this case?
 P.s. Before anyone asks, no, I do not have contact with the auditors so I can't ask them directly - they will be contracted by my client but that would be a few more months.

Since a domain-joined device places 'Domain Users' in the local USERS group by default, is there any reason for having the device's primary user's domain account in the local USERS group as well? 
 For example, Sally works for Contoso and is provided a domain-joined Windows 10 laptop named SALLYLAPTOP and account named 'sally@contoso.com'. SALLYLAPTOP's local USERS group has the domain group "Domain Users" in it. Does Sally's individual domain account also need to be in the local USERS group of SALLYLAPTOP? 
 If the answer is NO, and adding the specific user account is just redundant, why do you think so many machines have the user's domain account in their local USERS group? Is Windows doing this by default? If a domain user signs into a domain-joined laptop for the first time, does Windows automatically add the user's domain account to USERS? And is it worth my effort cleaning up all those local USERS groups, removing those individual accounts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been having some issues with our sip service over the past few weeks. Occasionally we are not able to dial out. We never have issues with inbound calls. After some additional troubleshooting I found that we were not able to dial out after our sip trunks were idle for some period of time, an inbound call would "fix" the problem and allow us to dial out. 
 I ran a packet capture on a L2 switch in between the SIP trunk provider's SBC & the ISP's router - we see the SIP Invite packets leaving their device but never get a response.
 The SIP Trunk provider states that the issue is they are not receiving those packets. It's about a dozen packets sent to 3 or 4 different WAN addresses. They're stating the the ISP isn't delivering them. 
 I want to call BS on the SIP trunk provider as we've had zero issues with our ISP otherwise. I reached out to the carrier anyways to see if it'd be possible for them to "prove" they are delivering the packets per the sip trunk provider's request. This request seems to be confusing them. 
 Normally I have the ability to just do things myself and figure out who's to blame but this is a new one for me. I tried switching our SIP Trunks over to our backup internet (different ISP) and wasn't able to reproduce the issue but it wasn't a long enough test window that I can say with confidence the issue doesn't occur. 
 Any recommendations on how to proceed?

 With so many damn ways to communicate anymore, how are sysadmins handle all the platforms people are using? At this point I have internal and external colleagues on Teams, Zoom, Slack, Meet, Reddit, and Discord. I tend not to be very active on them half because of them being scattered. 
 Back in the days of IRC there used to be clients to merge all the platforms into one app. Does anything like that exist anymore? RSS feeds? A digest app? A dozen monitors? How do you guys manage it?
 Edit: I'm going to add a little extra context. Our org has "standardized" on four platforms: Teams, Zoom, WebEx, and Slack. Which platform meetings are held depends on the department we're dealing with and how inflexible they are. I try to force all communication through Teams, but it's hit or miss.
 Vendors and other external orgs (e.g ACM slacks) I deal with tend to use Meet, Zoom and Teams. Again, I try to funnel through Teams but our org doesn't do guest accounts and some vendors are stubborn.
 Reddit and Discord is mostly me trying to stay up to date with tech news.

 I'll try and make this a clear without diagrams as possible.
 Currently labbing L3 down to the access layer utilizing OSPF in area 0. Everythings working with each access switch having two equal paths up to the internet. Happy days.
 I've had a play around disabling one of the links on the uplink switch so that only one link is now active. When running a constant ping from a pc on the access switch to 8.8.8.8 I get a loss of 3-4 packets. My understanding was that if both equal paths are in the routing table then theres no convergence and there should no loss.
 I've configured BFD which hasnt resolved. Could this be due to meusing ICMP and EVE NG as a test? Or something along the lines on the routing table not refreshing quick enough?
 I'd like to know your thoughts as this wouldn't be a good scenario within a datacentre

He is rolling his finger over the wheel going "wizz, wizz, wizz..." He says once you roll the mouse wheel it keeps rolling.
 Does anyone know what he is talking about? I don't know even what to ask my vendor for.
 Any direction would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I'm a new IT Generalist and Internal Facilities Manager.(Our building has their own) I've chosen Snipe-IT for our asset tracking. I'm kind of inheriting a mess and down for making it work. Smaller business, 100 employees. 30k Sq Ft office. Nothing tracked but machines, not even 100%.
 We outsource our helpdesk for now. So I'm looking at asset labels, but until I get that approved I'm just using a label maker. 
 We have several nicer label makers I want to see if I can make work. I still think the laptops needs legit metal tags for durability but in office monitors etc are fine for labels.
 Label makers we have: Zebra ZP 505 Zebra QLn420 Dymo 450 turbo Dymo Letra Tag Brother PT-D400
 Are any of these viable asset tag creaters that would make me not need to order metal/vnyl tags from asset tag.
 As far as asset tracking, I figured these categories were appropriate, pretty much anything over $50 in value. 
 Laptops Desktops Monitors Docking Stations Keyboard Mouse Combo (standard new hire) Keyboards (some are $250) Mouse (some are $100 ) Monitor Mounts? Every person has 2 arms and 2 monitors UPS Units ( So I can track and perform maintenance ) TVs in meeting rooms
 Consumables I understand are toner, office supplies etc.
 So, any of our current label makers be able to be sufficient in a decent quality tag? 
 I'd love to have it say 
 Property Owned by: Name/logo Company 
  123456
 But I need it pretty small. 
 And do those categories look pretty standard. Should I break it down by Individual office desk or just the general office. ( we have 2 suites ) 
 Thanks yall, I didn't see a better sub for this. 
 Also not many great videos on snipe it. I may have to make some.

 Router (1GbE) > Switch 1 (L3, 10GbE) > Switch 2 (L2, 1GbE)
 Using VLAN 1, 50 and 100.
 Our intention is to put a NAS (10GbE) and specific clients (10GbE) on VLAN50, all connected to the Switch 1. I just want to make sure, if we copy files between VLAN50 clients which are all on the same subnet and connected to the Switch 1, will traffic stay with the switch or also pass through the router and bottleneck the 10GbE requirement?
 If traffic does stay with the switch, would you still recommend us offloading the inter-VLAN routing by letting the Switch 1 be the gateway for VLAN50 instead of the router?

 I have a client that was recently infected with ransomware and all their files were encrypted. The worst of it was their MSSQL database with all the data they need to run their business without having to restart from the ground up. Due to not following best practices (Not my fault, I work for the software development company that developed the software that uses the database, not their IT provider) they were hit with the ransomeware. They paid the ransome, got the key and had some other company decrypt the data. 
 We got the unencrypted database MDF and backup files. I'm pretty sure the data is still there but the headers are gone so we are unable to attach or restore the files. I'm not the most savy with SQL so I thought I'd probe the mindhive. 
 Has anyone else had any success recovering SQL databses corrupted by ransomeware? TIA

 I’m looking for something with a couple of gigabit Ethernet ports that will just pass traffic like a bridge. It’s only needed for some testing so I don’t want to rearchitect the network to include another router / firewall. 
 I’ve tried playing abound with a spare Cisco ASA in transparent mode, but it got way too complicated as there are several VLANs and IP ranges involved. 
 Functionally I’m thinking about something like a “tap”, but with the ability to export Netflow. 
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using VRRP to provide layer 3 first hop redundancy for layer 2 switches, is using proxy arp on the VRRP routers enough to ensure that port isolation isn't broken? 
 The uplink ports of the layer 2 switches are connected to the VRRP routers.
 Multiple layer 2 switches will be connected to the VRRP routers. Normally I would put each layer 2 switch in a separate VLAN, but with VRRP this has the downside of wasting a large proportion of public IPv4 addresses in each subnet. Most switches have 24 or 48 port which do not align with subnet sizes.
 IP unnumbered would appear to be a solution to efficient use of IPv4 space, but I can find very little documentation about its use with VRRP. Well, other than information from Arista that it isn't supported:
 https://aristanetworks.force.com/AristaCommunity/s/question/0D52I00007EzQehSAF/unnumbered-ip-interfaces-and-virtual-router
 Does anybody know if other vendors, such as Cisco or Juniper, support VRRP with IP unnumbered?
 Huawei has a concept called super-VLAN, which is similar to IP unnumbered and it supports VRRP. Is this my only choice, other than trusting port isolation and proxy arp or wasting a large percentage of my IPv4 space with subnets and VRRP?

 So far so good I didn't really care about this, since I noticed some that some PCs are connecting way more then others.

 Like my PC generates 6 events/h and another generated something like 540 events/h. WHY ?
 The PCs are the same, they both are already done with their encryptions, and they show no errors in the MBAM reports.

Is there some type of monitoring software or hardware that would give me the ability to see what is being downloaded, anytime an external hard drive is plugged into the machines, and things of that nature.

 Hey I am currently developing a Shopify store and have found the offers in the app store lacking. 
 Im looking for a warehouse management system that can properly track all of my inventory, meaning that it can tell me where Product A is, e.g Product A is on shelf A.
 Concurrently it should also include an order processing system, which will compile a packing list of all the orders that have been paid for.
 Our old system has these features and it would be nice if there was an App that could do the same.
 I have found a couple companies that provide this externally from shopify, although i am not sure how trustworth they are (sksuvault, skusaavy) They seem to have everything I need, but they are very low key and I cannot find enough data supporting them to be reliable. I am willing to consider external apps that can be integrated into shopify aswell as shopify apps themselves.

 Elon Musk’s orders were clear: Close the data center.
 Early on Christmas Eve, members of the billionaire’s staff flew to Sacramento — the site of one of Twitter’s three main computing storage facilities — to disconnect servers that had kept the social network running smoothly. Some employees were worried that losing those servers could cause problems, but saving money was the priority, according to two people who were familiar with the move but not authorized to talk about it.
 The data center shutdown was one of many drastic steps Mr. Musk has undertaken to stabilize Twitter’s finances. Over the past few weeks, Twitter had stopped paying millions of dollars in rent and services, and Mr. Musk had told his subordinates to renegotiate those agreements or simply end them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So up until recently I worked for one of Fortinet’s competitors, and the general consensus (from our competitive intelligence team) was that Fortinet SD-WAN wasn’t truly up to snuff for a few reasons:
 (1) Supposedly, using ASICs in their hardware (as opposed to general x86 CPUs) means that customers have to rip and replace their appliances to get new functionality… I find this hard to believe, as aren’t their ASICS actually FPGA’s/programmable?
 (2) Lack of a “true” overlay… only VPNs with basic IP SLA’s attached. However… based on what research I’ve done, I don’t really see anything lacking in this area?
 (3) They require switches to sit in front of the appliances for HA… however, I understand that the newer branch models have built-in switches. Is this no longer a requirement?
 What’s your opinion? Was I fed lies / information that was no longer accurate? What’s the consensus on Fortinet SD-WAN?

 One he’s at a country I’ve blocked being able to connect to my VPN so made exception for him. Ticket had CEO CC’d who he is BFF with and had high urgency. 
 Replied to try again and he replied doesn’t work. I ask if I can remote into his machine and he says okay. I use ConnectWise and I’m in. Before I can even start investigating I get disconnected. 
 Try to reconnect and no go. Call him and no answer. I use CW on my office workstation and works fine. Email him to call me back. 
 4 hours later get email VPN still down. He finally calls me from a weird number and goes yeah I still can’t connect. I told him I was disconnected and he’s like yeah I closed the laptop lid to conserve battery. I’m like I called you why didn’t you answer. Oh yeah I jumped in the pool with my phone… I need a new phone. Then he goes don’t worry you can fix issue after New Year. I go you got my email on your phone right? And tell him you don’t need VPN to check email and if you get email on your phone why did you need your laptop. He just says Merry Christmas even tho we’re past it and hangs up. LOL
 Normally I’d be annoyed but it’s slow and my projects are done for year and I’m just studying for my next cert so this was a entertaining distraction of sorts.

The assistant IT director insists this is a safer method than service accounts, but I'm not sure if I agree. My concern is if DHCP reassigns a previously allow-listed address, it would potentially be possible for that device to spoof emails, or at least send emails using whatever domain address they want unauthenticated.
 What are your thoughts? Should I address this with our IT director?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve got a bit of a strange problem with a Dell R520 that presented a no boot device error when rebooting for Windows updates. 
 IDrac shows no hw issues, perc h710 mini shows good health and ran a consistency check with no issues. Virtual disk is selected as boot volume. Single VD, 3-disk raid5. 
 In the bios settings the boot is correctly set to uefi but no bootable devices are detected. 
 If I boot off an iso into Windows recovery I can clearly see the Windows partitions including the efi part and all the files. I also attempted to rebuild the eco boot record from a Dell support article. 
 I’m suspecting a quirky hw failure of the raid card but wanted to check with the community to see if I’m missing anything. Its one of our physical DCs and is redundant so it’s not hurting us, but if I can I would like to repair so I don’t have to do a rebuild.

 I've dabbled with automation/python here and there, decided I want to really dig deep into automation for 2023 and move into a network automation role. The cisco devnet associate exam caught my eye and I'm really loving it so far...UNTIL it started to get really heavy into the cisco proprietary stuff (DNA,APIC,ACI,NX-OS,CISCO SD-WAN,ISE,UCM,FIREPOWER) UGHHH. I don't have real world experience with any of these products, I've always worked in a mixed vendor environment.
 Would it make sense career wise to just tough it out and learn this stuff with no experience ? or should I just learn all the popular automation frameworks/tools/CICD stuff - work on some projects then apply to jobs ?
 Would this cert give me any leverage vs other folks who apply for the same position ? I don't know what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The IT manager title might be a bit generous, but I've been overseeing a three man IT team for a mid-sized nonprofit for the past 5 years, and have worked for the company for over 11 in total. My old boss and I built the department from the ground up when I first started there, and I stepped into his role when he left. Like with most small teams, my position wears a lot of hats from management/planning to hands-on sysadmin and tech work.
 Unlike when my old boss left, I don't think anyone internal is capable of filling the role, so while I'm sure the ship will be kept afloat for a while, they're eventually going to have to hire externally. I don't consider myself to be particularly hot shit, but unless they get lucky, they're going to have a hard time finding someone qualified to fill the role for what they're paying. I mostly stuck around as long as I did because of personal investment and the fact I was given freedom to operate and learn, which I value highly. I know their ability to replace me is ultimately not my problem, but I want to do what I feasibly can to make things easier on the guys under me when I leave, especially one who has a lot going on personally at the moment and is unlikely to be able to start job hunting any time soon if things go south.
 I'm giving a three-week notice after new year's. My current plan is to tidy up a couple of existing projects, make sure documentation is all shored up, help with hiring if HR miraculously gets candidates in time, and just generally be a resource until I leave. I might give my boss my contact information to potentially provide services at a contracted rate for emergencies as well, but I'm undecided on that.
 Is there anything else you guys would do specifically in my situation to help ease the turnover for your team?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you need context, I can see someone talking about it here. I'm using PHP and unsure of how to wrangle the UI for Azure or other systems in order to unblock the PHP code. What do we need to do? If it helps, the code for our connection is below, but I suspect that y'all don't care about the code (this is PHP + Laravel, which I think is where ClientManager comes from):
 <?php echo "beginning test\n"; $root_dir = dirname(dirname(__FILE__)); require_once $root_dir . "/email_oauth_test/vendor/autoload.php"; use Webklex\PHPIMAP\ClientManager; use Webklex\PHPIMAP\Client; try { echo "in try block\n"; $cm = new ClientManager($options = []); $client = $cm->make([ 'host' => 'outlook.office365.com', 'port' => 993, 'encryption' => 'ssl', // 'tls', 'validate_cert' => true, 'username' => 'redacted', 'password' => 'redacted', 'protocol' => 'imap', 'authentication' => "oauth", ]); $client->connect(); echo "connected!\n"; } catch (Exception $e) { echo "failed!\n"; } ?> 
 Right now it always outputs "failed!" Thanks for any pointers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After all that flooding in the MDF a few days ago, I've begun planning the hardware replacements. 
 Currently we're all in on Aruba/HP switches, with the occasional Netgear. They work great and I like them (besides the netgears). 
 We had new single mode fiber installed in 2015 and its never been used. We're still on the gigabit multimode stuff. 
 I figured its time to go 10g, we have 240+ 4k IP cams everywhere and they network is pretty much idling at 90% of 1gbps. I've had to start lowering bitrates on cams.
 The firewall is currently an aging SonicWall NSA2600, which I hate. Considering going Fortigate.
 The question is, Should I go Fortiswitch, or stay Aruba? We have about 40 switches. I hear full stack Fortinet is a magical thing.
 Currently the Arubas are managed by CLI/NetDisco. Its great, but NetDisco cant do much beyond identifying devices, and setting the untagged vlan - and I need to break out putty for anything else.
 Also need a Wi-Fi solution, FortiAP? Currently have Ruckus managed by the ISP, but we hate the ISP to the point where we're suing them and will be kicking them out next year. They'll probably take their R710s with them. We'd need about 500 WAPs with PPSK that can guarantee about 300mbps across 900 relatively modern devices.

 We've run into a major production issue with our pair of Dell 4032 switches - they are used as iSCSI for 3 esxi hosts and distribution for other devices. Issue is: out of the blue we lost access to several VMs. 
 Rebooting one of the two restored access, however, the issue keeps coming back and the only fix is a reload. We replaced one of the switches but the problem remains - after 1 day (at most) we lose access to critical VMs and until we reboot the device. There's nothing relevant in the logs (I'll attach the spanning-tree detail and running config). There were no changes made to the environment or configs. besides setting the root bridge ID to a lower value on one of the two (from the default 32768).
 Important to mention: when we lose the VMs - switch management and access is…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any living person on this Earth that actually disabled NTLM in his environment?
 Not in a lab or something like that, but with real working functioning production services.
 Because, you know, there is a lot of cybersecurity fuss about switching from NTLM to Kerberos and real vulnerabilities.
 I know that for Kerberos you need to be in contact with DC to acquire tickets or use something like KDC proxy and it is not always feasible.
 I know how to audit for NTLM usage on servers or on DC.
 But the question stands: Has anyone actually did disable NTLM in his production environment? How did it go? What’s the caveats?
 I’m thinking that it is possible to disable incoming NTLM authentication traffic only on some of the servers and audit helps here.
 But the main target here is DCs. So, how about disabling incoming NTLM auth only on DCs? And I haven’t seen any success stories on this matter anywhere.
 I’m asking this question in r/sysadmin specifically, because I don’t need any more guides on how to do it, but actually I need some information from people that actually did it and do support these environments afterwards.
 UPD: I'm not talking about disabling NTLMv1 and just forcing NTLMv2. I'm talking about complete disablement of incoming NTLM auth. This GPO for example: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic

Then I have to work backwards to find why they think something, how it actually works, and get the information correctly, then inform them that they are actually wrong. It's usually just "oh okay, thought you meant something else". 
 I just don't understand it. I'll gladly be the idiot constantly saying I don't exactly know, but I have an idea let me get back to you in a bit. Some people just hammer down concrete facts (to them) even though they are blatantly wrong, and it leads to so much extra wasted time to unravel what's actually going on. There have been times when I straight up trusted coworkers and did something exactly as they or their documentation said and its still wrong lol

 After a few days of this silliness, I walked to her desk and watched her log in. No issues.
 The next day, she couldn't log in again. I walk over, and she tries again, and no issues. She has no idea what's happening and suspects we're messing with her. I assure her that we're not.
 The next day, inevitably, she can't log in again. So I walk over and watch her log in. When she's in, I make her log out and back again. And again. After the third attempt, she's convinced everything is good, so I walk back to my desk, and she's right back there saying it stopped working again. 
 I was irritated by this time, and I asked her to describe exactly what she did after I left.
 "Nothing, I swear! My login only works while you're here!"
 Back at her desk, I watched her type in her password more closely and facepalmed. 
 When we gave her a random password or while I was at her desk, she would look down at her keyboard as she typed, and it worked. But all the other times, she would touch-type her password and instinctively add a space at the end.

A year ago we hired an MSP to help be our "virtual CTO" and were woo'd with promises of stability, future infrastructure projections and 24/7 on-call support.
 All was well for the first six months, but now we are over a year into the relationship and the veil has been lifted. We no longer get the quarterly check-in's with fancy charts and future mapping, the MSP IT team really only have one or two specialists that can work on network issues and complex SQL problems, and worse yet, their "projects" team is a place where tickets and requests go to die unless we babysit the progress.
 We are looking to move to a new MSP that we believe will be able to meet the demands of our company, but until then we are still semi-reliant on our current MSP to handle routine tasks, be on call, etc.I am working to get their knowledgebase of our company extracted for internal documentation in hopes that we can make a smoother transition to a new MSP at a later date. 
 I just want to know what your experience has been with difficult MSP partners, and how to handle them?

 He needs a script that downloads a specific language and sets it as default, configure locale and regional settings. We checked for those things online, and found some long scripts in powershell to configure regional settings and locale (locale is easy), which don't appeal him. I'm just wondering, is there an option to switch regional settings with a single cmdlet or maybe do it programmaticaly in C#? And to download a language package, install it and set it as default?

 Let's compare E3 vs E5.
 I have just few users on E5 and some on E3.
 How does the Defender for office 365 work currently? Does it need only one user licensed or each one needs to be licensed additionally?
 The users with E3 only will not benefit with Defender for Office 365 at all in this case? So no additional scanning of attachments, safe links options and so on?

Ever since we enabled Hybrid AD join in our organisation (or at least I think that is the issue, since I noticed they were gone around that time), most of the users’ machines disappeared from the devices tab under each user. Like we can see their phones for example, but the computer just isn’t there. It’s not a big deal but sometimes it’s the quickest way to find out someone’s machine and I’d like to bring it back for the sake of my own convenience. 
 What I noticed so far is that my own machine, that is not available to look up in my user devices page, its Join Type is Hybrid Azure AD Joined; MDM: None Then I looked up my boss machine, that one is actually available under his Devices tab and what differs is his machine’s Join Type is Azure AD registered, MDM also says none. 
 Could you guys help me fix this and bring all the users devices available under their respective Devices tab. Let me know if any logs/screenshots/etc is needed 
 Cheers and happy happy holidays!

 User contacts helpdesk. Helpdesk tech joins a teams meeting. Install. Admin Credential Prompt. Login by tech. Proceed. Next install. Repeat.
 Except at some point, user opens a command prompt for one of the installs and doesn't close it, just minimizes. Session ends.
 User now has an admin command prompt. lusrmgr.msc and they can grant local admin rights to themselves. Undoes everything regarding restrictions on local installs.
 Is this just failure by the user for obviously trying to slip by processes? Or failure of the tech to make sure they watched what they signed in for? Or failure of some larger approach that makes something like this impossible?
 What would you put in place to make it so that a user with an admin command prompt couldn't grant local admin rights? Or is this basically past the point of no return and the only thing you can do is make sure the tech watches what they login for?
 Granted. User's actions are trying to bypass the rules. I'm more curious what can stop this beyond better trained helpdesk tech's.

 I'm trying to setup a fortigate box with 4 VDOMs where each VDOM needs to access the internet with it's own IP address.
 I've used a Fortinet guide to setup the VDOMs and have the root do the WAN stuff so each VDOM only knows about it's own network and forward the rest to the root.
 Everything works but I can't figure out how to use a different IP for each VDOM's WAN.
 I have a /29 subnet so I have enough IPs but I can't find a way to set a different IP since my WAN port has a way to only set one IP for it.
 Any help is blessed!
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been thinking about a long held tenet of IT administration in the context administrative accounts.
 It’s good practice to have administrative accounts separate to day to day accounts, and only to use them for administrative tasks, but as an extension of that I wanted to find out if anyone had gone even further than segregation of activity by account and actually denied local logon in a windows centric network to admin accounts for administrative functions, relying solely on elevation where required.
 This would include servers and clients; currently my team and myself, login using our admin account to perform admin functions, I’m thinking of changing our governance on that to enforce login using standard accounts with elevation using admin credentials within the standard login required for changes.
 My thinking is that this will reduce the opportunities for misconfiguration by imposing an administrative control whilst simultaneously reducing admin account chatter in our siem logs for more focused reporting and alerting on admin activities.
 Interested in what the community thinks or does already.

 A day has passed and all seems fine. You're headed to your parent's place to kickstart the holidays and as far as you're concerned, the back-end changes were steadily applied the day prior.
 Your automated IT monitoring solution alerts you about a vague error, but you've just arrived at Ma's house so you figure you'll deal with it later. Before you can stuff your mouth full of spanakopita, your phone's ringing off the hook: it's your <insert scary C-Suite executive here>, screeching at the top of their lungs about a critical revenue-impacting service being down.
 You know how this goes. 
 You've abandoned your poor partner with woke Uncle Ross spouting mercury in microwave theories at the dinner table, while you troubleshoot issues from your parent's dialup internet in your childhood bedroom. The stuffed animals judging you from afar because you couldn't save yourself the heartache by implementing a change management freeze 'till 2023.
 For the sake of your vacation, your peers, your family, your partner, and your sanity, don't hit Enter.
 Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to all, and thank you for keeping this sub dope. <3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Murphy's law got me... I was doing some maintenance before a holiday, and one of the steps was rebooting my core switch, an Aruba CX 6405.
 I rebooted it remotely of course, and noticed it was taking a VERY LONG time for the network to come back online. So I go to the datacenter and see an angry red fault light blinking, along with slot 3 blinking red. The card that has failed is a 48-port smart rate poe card with 4 50g sfp56 ports, part number R0X41A.
 In the logs, I found this information:  Message Event|3207|LOG_ERR|AMM|1/1|Line module 1/3 has failed: Internal error Severity Critical (Priority: 3) Syslog ID hpe-cardd Source Time 12/28/22 21:44:38 (1672281878338489) Sequence # 630,332,193 
 My Google skills are failing me here... I find that event 3207 mentioned in a few documents, but they don't give any troubleshooting steps. I have opened a ticket with ASP, but they can't even tell me when an engineer will call at this point.
 Any ideas what I can do to troubleshoot? Here's what I've tried so far:
  
Reboot again, crossing fingers and toes
 Reseat the card in its slot
 Upgrade to the latest firmware published at ASP
 Allowed the switch to perform an "unsafe update" on non-redundant modules (it asked to do this)

Every time we hire a new person, they are super confused. Why does Microsoft do stuff like this? You would have thought someone said... we already have an app called that so maybe we should use a different name.

 I ask because we are a Cisco Shop. But most of our team in the last few years has retired. We have a 50/50 split and I've been tasked with looking at alternatives for our refresh. We are looking to replace all of our switches to Cisco 9K with ISE (We have), DNA(We have) and NetBox. We're going to be running an "SDN Fabric" for our refresh.

 It was using its "Behavioral AI" engine which is increasingly appearing to be shit.
 I now specifically put in an exclusion for
 C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zFM.exe
 And it accepts it but says "This exclusion is not recommended". Really? Where how else am I suppose to stop you deleting 7-Zip file manager.

Wasabi does not support 3d-secure payment with visa cards, meaning European companies are left without practical ways to pay. Therefore Wasabi first asks to disable 3D-secure (which is not possible), then shut off these customers.
 That's an absurd way to lose customers, pushing them to other service providers. Fine for me, good alternatives exist.
 From the customer support :
 Hi xxx,
 I did just take a look at the conversation that you had with my Colleague XXXXXX, all of this was correct. At this time, the Wasabi Console does not have support for Credit Cards the require use of 3D-secure/OTP type authentication. If you do not have another type of card, your account will eventually be deleted form the system due to payment issues.

 Scenario: 
 I host a client's (C1) server in my datacenter. C1 is working with a vendor (V1) to have (site to site) VPN connectivity for V1's services. 
 V1 provides their peer gateway - I already have this peer configured for a tunnel for another client (C2). 
 V1 refuses to modify VPN to include C1 (already containing C2) (security policy), they won't provide any other peer, I don't have an additional peer to provide. C1 has already paid for V1's services, signed contract, etc. 
 I know this is a very dumbed-down scenario, but I have no clue how to even start tackling this. I don't have any access to C1's network. I do have a VPN set up from my datacenter to C1. 
 Could I get some assistance, something pointing me in at least a "starter" direction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been my experience that without an IGMP Snooping Querier on the network, multicast traffic effectively flows like a network broadcast within a VLAN (broadcast domain) and will hit every attached node. 
 When you have an IGMP Snooping Querier (like a gateway that is configured to support it) then the IGMP messages flow correctly and IGMP Snooping on the switch-side, which is typically enabled by default, has something to work with and properly filters outbound ports that aren't joined to the IGMP group. 
 This is likely an over-engineering rabbit hole, but for networks that you don't expect to actually do multicast routing - do you still enable an IGMP Snooping Querier somewhere on the network? That way things like SSDP stay within their boundaries (239.255.255.250:1900)? Although thinking further, the other chatty protocol - mDNS/bonjour uses 224.0.0.251 which is link-local multicast and from my experience doesn't get "snooped". 
 From some PCAPs I did see that Meraki has the layer 2 switch Querier feature enabled by default.
 Just curious if this is something others think about enabling.

Can anyone tell me if I am using the correct terms and if not, what would be the correct things to google? 
 Edit: We are running FTD on FMC. All up to date. Cisco 1140s and vFMC. ISE 2.7 patch 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m wondering if the following setup is even possible to deploy. If so, what would I need to accomplish it, and if not, what would be the best way to achieve similar results.
 I want to have two lines with two different ISPs, and a VPS with a BGP session. Then, I would make a GRE tunnel to the VPS through each line and bond the two tunnels. Finally, I would go out to the Internet through the VPS’s own connection and using an IP range from an AS of my own, announced with the VPS’s BGP session.
 The objectives to accomplish here are mainly three, from the most important to the least:
  
Using my ASN. ISPs where I live charge extremely high prices for a line that allows you to use BGP, so I can save a big chunk of money here.
 
Redundancy. There’s why I want two lines with two ISPs, instead of two lines with the same ISP or even a single line.
 
Increased throughput. That’s why I want to do bonding instead of load balancing.
 
 The real question is: what do I need in terms of hardware and software?

 A machine at work was being bitlocked and the user that sits at the desk decided to restart the machine, even after being explicitly told not to do so by one of our technicians. Now the HDD in question has failed. Under Disk Management it shows the HDD is not initialized however, it fails to initialize and shows the error message "Initialize disk failed due to fatal device hardware error".
 Wondering if this has happened to anyone else and how you were able to resolve the matter and bring the drive back to life (if at all possible)?
 ​
 Edit: Thank you everyone for your insight, I am not the most familiar with Bitlocker and all of you have been very helpful.

Though I could be wrong - I swear it wasn't there before, as I was recently around that area quite a bit to inspect a sidewalk install. It doesn't connect to anything inside or outside the box - but it comes out through the pipe that the fiber has been run through and is coiled 6-7 times around the last bit of the insulated portion of the fiber cable. The gauge is way to small to be a pull wire and also appears to be way too small to be any type of ground wire. I've seen this type of wire used for signals before, but I can't imagine what it would be used for. Gallery Here (three images)

 We are sending via zoho mail and using Proofpoint as outbound gateway . Zoho support says the emails are relayed to Proofpoint, so you need to check with them. 
 We have raised the issue with channel managers and are waiting for their support (very slow) to respond. Is there any suggestion or recommendation by community members to troubleshoot the issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have multiple DCs in different locations for our company. We have a primary Domain Controller. On every DC, we have a constant barrage of event ID 4412 in Event Viewer, saying there is a conflict between files and the losing one is sent to the ConflictAndDeleted folder. I can’t figure out why this is happening. Files replicate correctly, but any file in the sysvol directory is subject to this error and having the copy deleted. I used procmon to see what files were being accessed. Files are being accessed by DFS service. I think it causes the service to think there was a change, and the 4412 event happens. We had nearly 1,000,000 files taking up 120GB before we realized what was happening. The ConflictAndDeleted folder on every server is slowly filing up, ignoring the limit I put on each CAndD folder in ADSI.
 When the DFS Replication service is turned off, obviously nothing happens. But when it's turned on, files will disappear from the folder, only to come right back a second later. The folder will have 8 items in it, then 7, then 8, and all I'm doing is sitting there watching.
 I've spent days on this, trying every article I can find. We have CyberArk and Commvault on the DCs. It might be the archive bit being changed by Commvault, but it's happening dozens of times a second, with the same files, and only in the sysvol folder.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so it seems like Microsoft is disabling the option to install Win 10\11 22h2 for dynamic disks.
 This was their answer as for why
 " Dynamic disks have been deprecated from Windows and we don't recommend using them anymore. Instead, we recommend using basic disks or using the newer Storage Spaces technology when you want to pool disks together into larger volumes. If you want to mirror the volume from which Windows boots, you might want to use a hardware RAID controller, such as the one included on many motherboards. "
 why, just why? despite the fact almost all of OEM images already burned w i t h l i c a n s e on a dynamic disk...
 "oh you want to get the latest build? either you remove all of your data and convert to basic or pay for a 3rd party software like aomei to convert for you." Sorry for the rant but this is just stupid

 After a short contract, I was offered said position at a software company specializing in data analytics/scraping.
 My entire life, I thought that anyone who could code or script was already at the absolute top of the food chain. Had already been there, done that, been through hell desk, and data centers!
 Boy! That Network Administrator position turned into Senior Hand Holder of the Dev Department.
 I was wrong. Very wrong.
 For years after, I continued to think the same of my fellow various admin’s I worked with. Everyone must just be better than me, I don’t know anything.
 Soon, I will be 30. Young-ish I suppose. But I’ve at least learned that we each have our skills. Whether that’s more, or less… 
 Even if someone appears as a prodigy, you can teach them something, many something’s perhaps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: I have a bunch of users that work on desktops, but depending on the day, they log into different desktops (think lab users, secretaries etc).
 They want their user data synced between the desktops, and importantly also their bookmarks.
 For the user data I would use folder redirection, it seems the most straight forward as these desktops are always online and in the domain, they are never moved off the domain so folder redirection should work very well.
 But unless I am mistaking, this cannot sync bookmarks of chrome, firefox and edge, can it?
 For the bookmarks I have been looking at roaming profiles, but this seems to not be recommended anymore as it often creates problems. I have found scripts that would make roaming profiles work with chrome and firefox bookmarks though, so it seems like a viable option.
 Is user profile disks an option here? I know it's designed for RDS, which is not the use case here, but rather profiles on local desktops within the domains. We don't have an RDS farm and would prefer not to set one up if it's not needed (due to licensing etc).
 Assuming user profile disks is a good option here, would it be best to combine it with folder redirection for all the 'standard' files (as it would likely reduce the size of the disk) or is it better to go with just 1 solution to keep it simple?
 Perhaps FSLogix is a solution here as well? To be combined with folder redirection or on its own?
 Thanks in advance!

 So well, I don't need any exotic features, just need something simple, free, safe, like for installing printers drivers for her every two months. Any suggestions ?
 Thanks in avance !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all sysadmins, I am part owner of a small/medium-sized growing company. Our company employs around 70-80 employees who are using mobile devices for their everyday work. 35 of them are using Windows laptops, 4 are using MacBooks and the rest 30-40 Field Service Agents are using Android Smartphones. 
 During Covid, we changed our IT infrastructure to a cloud-based one with ZOHO. We migrated from our custom-made onsite apps made on Visual Basic to ZOHO's Creator Platform. So far, it has been 2 years and with many ups and downs, we have finally made it to a somewhat smooth transition. Now back to my main question. As many of our employees are sometimes working from home and sometimes from the office, it becomes tricky to manage our devices. This includes windows updates, monitoring for any malware, system monitoring, etc. Is there any cloud-based tool that can help us monitor our devices.
 About me: I do not have an IT background but have to some extent knowledge of how things work. ;)

 In the company I work for, some processes still proceed with paper documents.
 For example, if someone from the company is going out by car,
 We have a draft.
 He writes in this draft which vehicle he will go out, where he will go, for what reason he will go out, and he has his manager sign it. The manager then sends the paper to the relevant manager for approval.
 It's a no-nonsense thing.
 What is the most practical way to solve this process in the computer environment? Is there an open source web service you can recommend? I would like to use it on my local server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We’re in the market for a new NGFW for our office. Just over 10 users but we host a variety of applications on our server at the office. 
 We currently have a Sophos XG and it’s ok, but I’m beginning to hate Sophos. I don’t know why we went down that path, it’s GUI is clunky, it doesn’t have mDNS (we do a lot of audio visual so it’s handy to have) and today we had to reboot the damn thing because it simply just decided to stop working. 
 We currently have a proxy on our server to handle all the request to different applications from our single public IP. Would be good to move that to the device but not a biggie.
 Our internet speed is 500/500.
 Security is a big thing, I regularly see palo being recommended here, forti too.
 I personally see watchguard, palo and Cisco in the field.
 A apart of me doesn’t want to spend a bunch of money but I know if it’s spent in the right area, I won’t have to think about it again. 
 Saw a silver peak device not long ago but it looks like they only do SD-WAN and not actual firewalling? We’re an Aruba house in central so would tie in nicely.
 We also use the connect VPN from Sophos, it’s good but average too. So anything with a “good” VPN is preferred.
 Open to all thoughts, ask as many questions to help best understand our requirement.

They don't have a dedicated IT department and our manager wants us to export the mailbox from their environment and import it into ours, which is Exchange 2013 on-prem.
 Now this would be simple if the size was manageable but it's not and we're trying to avoid .pst corruption and not interested in using any 3rd party apps. I've searched the web, this sub and a few other forums and the consensus is to break the export down into smaller .pst files by either date or folders. Which seems fairly straight forward but I figure I'd ask the experts to see if that's it or if anyone has input on any other workable options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[from the dhcp rfc:
  
Note that, in some network architectures (e.g., internets with more than one IP subnet assigned to a physical network segment), it may be the case that the DHCP client should be assigned an address from a different subnet than the address recorded in 'giaddr'. Thus, DHCP does not require that the client be assigned as address from the subnet in 'giaddr'. A server is free to choose some other subnet, and it is beyond the scope of the DHCP specification to describe ways in which the assigned IP address might be chosen.
  
Imagine a relay receives a DHCPDISCOVER on interface eth0 with address 192.168.1.1, then it forwards it to the dhcp server at 192.168.0.1, now because it's not required to give an address on the 192.168.1.0 subnet, it gives an address on the 192.168.0.0 subnet, how is this acceptable?
 ​
 Then another host on the 0.0 subnet would arp for the client, but the client wouldnt receive the arp broadcast since they are not on the same physical subnet.

The DMZ switches have reached EOL, and our network is small enough to handle the extra traffic load put onto the Core switch. Now back when I took my CCNA, I got the impression that the DMZ switch was supposed to be a separate switch, but my coworker, who has way more experience than me, says that in his experience they're integrated into the core.
 That being said, I'm trying to wrap my head around how the integration would work. I am thinking it's a case of directing incoming traffic from the ISP switches via VLANs to our firewall, before the firewall allows the traffic onto the core switch?

One of the things that is now becoming glaringly apparent, is the lack of documented policies & procedures, along with internal IT auditing. 
 What software are you guys using for ongoing auditing & documenting of SDLC, change management systems and is there a general starting point for a baseline to work with?
 Would like it to integrate with AD, G-Suite & some 3rd party apps if that is possible. Curious to see what is out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something I see with disappointing regularity in the sysadmin subreddit, and to a lesser extent in professional life, is criticism of the "previous sysadmin". That voiceless, anonymous entity who wasn't doing backups properly, left AD in a mess, let some critical server support contracts expire...which our intrepid hero swoops in to fix with a theatrical sigh. "Just another day single-handedly keeping this company afloat...what would they do without me?"
 Besides being a cheap vehicle for self praise and narcissism, they don't seem to consider how "their" network might similarly be judged by any new sysadmin taking their position. Suspending their disbelief for a moment that anybody could possibly take over their very important and utterly unique network, they'd likely find the new sysadmin would have no problem digging out incorrect configurations, design mistakes, oversights, skeletons in the wiring closet etc. 
 Because we all have them. Every network big and small. And what we all also share are budget constraints, time pressures, staff shortages, bad management, lazy colleagues. Take these into account next time you're going to shit on the work of the previous sysadmin, especially if you don't know them personally, because I can guarantee you the next sysadmin will equally be able to shit on your work too. It's very easy to disregard the good work done and focus on the "bad".
 I just need to remind myself every time I read a comment from somebody "fixing the mess left by the previous sysadmin" that they're likely inexperienced, lack exposure to multiple networks, and desperate to display competence to their peers. I was like this too in my first few years in IT, so quick to pick out mistakes to disparage "the last guy". Now, with some experience behind me, I find myself giving them the benefit of the doubt, realise that whoever set it up this way may have had extraneous factors going against them, and could probably explain if they were there.

 We are running a cisco environment, and I'm currently managing via putty.
 I was hoping to better organize the devices, so that I can label devices by names, instead of referring to a spreadsheet when figuring out what device I need to ssh into.
 I've tried one program, maybe it was superputty, that I used to organize myself. Then, after it's software updated, it wiped all my saved device ssh log ins.
 I though it may have been my mistake, took the time to rebuild all, and it wiped again after another update.
 So I've been using putty ever since. 
 Is there an alternative that works simply, that you guys are using? I'm looking for something minimalistic and easy to use without any complex setup requirements. 
 Looking forward to your thoughts. 
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking for a new job for a while now. Around the beginning of November, I got a hit from a small digital design company looking to bring on their first dedicated IT SysAdmin/Help desk person. Their Lead designer has been their acting IT person and the job has become so much that he's not able to do any design work. I have gone through two interview rounds with them as of December 16th and they just scheduled what I presume to be the final interview for January 13th.
 Enter job number two, an international industrial software dev. I applied to this job at the beginning of December, and they got back to me a few days later. I had an initial call with the recruiter. A week later, on December 20th, I had my second interview with one of their two IT personnel. He liked me and I let him know at the end of the interview that I had already done two rounds with the first company and was expecting the third and final round around the beginning of January. He thanked me and said that changes their interview schedule a bit. The next morning, I got an email to schedule the interview with their director of IT on the 22nd. This morning (27th) I got an email that they want to schedule a call for tomorrow to talk about final steps. I presume this means an offer because the recruiter told me both people I interviewed with had positive things to say.
 So, we get to my situation. Do I send an email off to the first company to see about getting the interview moved up to maybe January 3rd if possible? I would like to have two offers to mull over rather than getting an offer and either waiting to accept, or accepting, only to get a better offer and have to rescind my acceptance from the second company?
 Edit: ok, an email has been sent. Now we wait to see what happens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an odd one - i'm not a networking guy, much more of a generalist. We have the vendor reviewing this but they are taking their time.
 We have a box in the DMZ that has a nic in our LAN and a nic in the DMZ.
 When it's up, it causes two external facing resources to go down which also have IPs in the DMZ.
 Running a packet capture from the troublesome box reveals that the impacted resources are retransmitting many packets and I'm seeing many SACK_PERM's, but it also appears to be as though this trouble box is jumping into other conversations. Example:
 381 7.286147 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [external IP of something outside our network] TCP 68 [TCP Port numbers reused] 443 → 53905 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=8190 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=256 SACK_PERM 382 7.286170 [troublesome box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 96 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)
 Where packet 382 contains the source and destination IPs from packet 381. It's like the troublesome box sees packet 381, encapsulates it, and sends it back to the impacted resource, but gets a destination unreachable. It's not doing this to all other IPs in the DMZ either, just two of them.
 Another example of the trouble box showing up after a regular ICMP
 349 6.621700 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [some external IP] ICMP 62 Echo (ping) reply id=0x0004, seq=8403/54048, ttl=255 350 6.621737 [troublesom box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 80 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)
 And packet 350 contains this under the ICMP portion of its packet: Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: [impacted resource DMZ IP], Dst: [some external IP]
 Anyone have any idea what this thing is doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've got a peculiar problem that I have not been able to resolve on my own. Google does not give any good results and none of the suggestions I've tried seems to help. This is a hybrid O365 enviroment, all affected users have been transfered to O365 a long time ago, problem started about 2-3 months ago.
 The problem is that some users (about a dozen or so) randomly loose the ability to send emails ie the email is not sent but stays in the Outbox folder. Only solution so far is to remove the email profile on the affected computer and create a new profile. That helps a week or so before the problem pops up again for the user.
 When the user is unable to send email I can not open the users email settings from Outlook or from the Control Panel/Mail. Nothing hapens when I try to open "Email Accounts...".
 The obvious Send/Receive manually does nothing. Outlook is online and new email arrive without problem. I've tried to reimage the computer, sfc /sannow (yes, I'm desperate), reinstall Office O365, start Outlook in safemode, resetnavpane etc etc. My google foo have not given me any good match nor solution to my problem.

 ​
 I've tried Dell Command Powershell Provider without success..
 And every other guide are for people that forgot or want to bypass a unknown BIOS password...
 ​
 Never thought it would be this difficult.

 Hello! I know this subreddit doesn’t often concern itself with layer 1 folk, but I am unsure of any other relevant subreddits to ask in, so will post here. 
 Basically, I have been tasked auditing all the fibers at a Headend for a Cable MSO and have been racking my head on the best way to capture data to best satisfy all involved. My employer contracts with the MSO to provide a plethora of services both for the inside plant and outside plant. I’m technically being paid by the Construction department, but since my work is meant to support everyone involved with “Node Splits”, I have been trying to loop in all relevant parties:

 Earlier this year I joined a new company where I am now the sole IT and there are things with which I am still unexperienced. 
 In this case, we run an on-prem exchange 2019 and clients can send and receive autodiscover request, however it asks for the server type (like here) and I just couldn't find if this is normal or if the autodiscover is faulty. I have seen nowhere any clue if autodiscover should provide what type of server you are connecting or not, but my instinct tells me that the autodiscover answer from the server should provide that.
 Anyone knows where to look at to send that to clients when they do an autodiscover ? 
 I have extensively tried the tools to test Autodiscover, and it says my settings are correct, however it doesn't say where this setting is supposed to be, if it actually exists.

 I hope you had a great xmas time.
 I want to start using WAC but due to a multiple domain structure without a forest (I know, I know. Not my fault) I want to save credentials for the imported servers. But everytime I restart WAC it shows my user, not the user information I added to the entries.
 Is there any possibility to save the credentials or is it just not possible by design? It drives me crazy that I cant use WAC because of that.
 Thank you in advance.

Plan is to migrate mails from on-prem exchange 2013 (1 server) to Microsoft365 and then get rid off on-prem exchange server, but keep on prem ad server, sql server, legacy apps, SSO (same password for mail, pc). So we want to have some kind of hybrid environment with mails being in a cloud. We dont want to reconfigure all computers (or at least amount of time if it has to be), have at least amount of downtime.
 Reading MS pages and articles online gave me some info that minimal hybrid migration would be an option. But still there will need to be on prem exchange server to manage users? Are there any solutions to this to get rid of old server or have a newer exchange version on a VM just for management? Also i dont quite understand the line from MS article "Do not plan to continue to run directory synchronization to manage your users"? Isnt this hybrid migration?
 Is there a more suitable migration path for this case?
 TLDR version, plan is to get mail in a cloud, get rid off old exchange 2013 server and manage mails on exchange online. Infrastructure remain on prem. What is the most suitable option.

We can set the number of licenses needed and additional users will be locked out, thus preventing compliance issues. Shit bag Autodesk is asking us to purchase 5 3-yr civil 3D licenses to come to compliance, they claim our 2 user subscriptions had additional install/session more than the number of licenses. We asked them to reduce the demand , as those licenses will sit idle and be a waste since we don’t use civil 3D much. They looped in their attorney, and we asked them to communicate with our legal as well. they started to increase their threats, saying there will be a 25% additional penalty if we involve legal. Is this even legal? They are retaliating if wanted our attorney to communicate with them on our behalf? We never threatened litigation or lawsuits, and only asked for our lawyer to handle communication with them as We are too busy to keep discussing it with them. They know we are valid customers, as we spend $40k+ per year on their ridiculously expensive innovyze software, which they recently acquired to add to their monopoly. Any suggestion to responding to Autodesk, when they threatens to add additional penalties to talk to our legal? We paid them the stupid 5 licenses, at this point it sounds like they like to retaliate and have their customers bend over. Funny thing is we have alternatives, unlike architects who are dependent on Revit, etc. In three years we will move towards an Autodesk free environment.

 I spend the last 1.5 years working from home, using my personal desktop computer (PC). There were several things I had to install, to let me clock in & to connect to their phone system & network. One of the things was called SentinelOne; we were only told that it was for security/malware protection, since we would have access to a lot of sensitive information; made sense, since several hacks/breaches had been in the news around that time.
 It ended up blocking my PC's internet access, except for the program itself, so that it could continue running (can't close it, 24/7) & sending regular screenshots & reports (every 4 hours).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've noticed a lot of threads regarding Password Managers. Since this place has helped me grow in the last 5 years, I'd like to contribute to the community.
 Today, I've put together a How-To guide on deploying a self-hosted BitWarden instance. The guide will go over the following:
  
How-To Create the Virtual Machine
 How-To Install the Operating System
 How-To Configure the Operating System
 How-To Install BitWarden
 How-To Automate the Maintenance for BitWarden
 (Later) Admin Training Documentation
 (Later) User Training Documentation
  
To see the entire list of high-level steps for this How-To, please view the overview page here: BitWarden Self-Host Installation Overview - GitHub
 The guide is broken into 4 Chapters (5 & 6 will be made when I have time tomorrow):
  
Chapter 1: Deploy Virtual Machine: Chapter 1: Deploy Virtual Machine - Github
 Chapter 2: Operating System Setup: Chapter 2: OS Setup - Github
 Chapter 3: BitWarden Application Setup: Chapter 3: BitWarden Setup - Github
 Chapter 4: BitWarden Automated Maintenance: Chapter 4: Automated Maintenance - Github
 (Hopefully tomorrow) Chapter 5: Admin Training Documentation
 (Hopefully tomorrow) Chapter 6: User Training Documentation
  
Chapter 1 & 2 will more than likely be skipped by many of you, but it was created to show the entire process from start to finish.
 In Chapter 4, I go through on how to automate the maintenance. The PowerShell scripts do NOT have email notification enabled by default. If you have your own email functions, you can swap in your function with the one in the script and uncomment the Send-Email lines within the script(s).
 Please leave your suggestions on what I should add, remove, or change. The scripts can definitely be updated (e.g., creating a PowerShell module would be a good start).

 When hired, I was told there were possibilities for growth etc. At the time I had some college experience and a couple months in helpdesk, so it was an amazing position for me. 
 The manager of the systems team publicly stated multiple times that he wanted me on his team and I should get training to move over. That was 5 months ago. I got my AZ-900 and constantly asked for permissions to take over more work. I was only ever given permissions to do a task after a month of begging to do more. 
 I got a job offer for a Jr. sysadmin position with a significant pay raise. They are aware of my limited experience, but liked my attitude. I gave my old position one chance to match and all I got was a job description of an "associate engineer" without my name, the date, anybody's signature, pay was verbal, and no effective date. No thanks 
 I'm looking forward to escaping the out of the SD for obvious reasons, but expect to come across an entirely different set of issues lol. I was the glue that held that team together, and I know for a fact that two people will be leaving right after me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a software engineer by trade, now a manager of software engineers. Three years ago my company (around 100 people) had an IT Director, A VP of Technology and an Assistant IT Director. The VP of Technology moved on. Then the IT Director moved on and the assistant was elevated and finally he left a little over a year ago.
 Recently my company asked me to be Director of IT and I said no. I got a look at what all needed to be done, our security needs, etc. and decided it was too much for one person and not what I wanted to be doing, so I said they should hire someone and turned them down.
 Recently, they started asking me to tackle specific IT tasks as one-offs and I’m finding myself drifting back towards a role I said no to. Being asked to take on more and more responsibilities related to IT. 
 I’m not sure what my question really is. I’m just lamenting the situation, I think. With some institutional support for decision making and maybe some staff to actually execute, maybe I could do the job. I don’t have the experience specifically in IT, though, and I’m muddling through based on having 2 decades of general software experience and enough systems experience to be dangerous.
 There is definitely more to this job, however, these days. More than just knowing how these systems work. There’s prioritizing the various risks the company faces and executing the implementation of systems and processes that we’re now behind on from years of neglect. To say nothing of how to deal with upgrading equipment, budgeting for long term maintenance, etc. It just feels very overwhelming and I’m wondering if it’s crazy that I just want to walk away.

 Of course, the issues with and fragility of Southwest's IT infrastructure have been well-known for years now, and it's management's own fault for not taking the initiative to develop it to meet the demands of their rapid operational expansion and the modern industry (including interlining, GDS interoperability, etc.)...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MDF flooded today (12/26). Well more than just the MDF, like most of the building flooded today when the fire suppression system and water main exploded in multiple places. We're talking 110PSI of water flying out from an 8 inch water main somewhere in the ceiling and just destroying everything. I had a co-worker show me video of a poor HP prodesk getting blasted with unbelievably high pressure water.
 This actually started on xmas (yesterday), I was watching over the cams remotely and seeing the mess unfold. At the time it didn't affect me so I just sat at home and watched the chaos unfold. I thought they turned the water off for the whole building but today around noon - more water lines exploded in a few more places - and one of those was the MDF.
 By the time I got in there, it was no longer raining from the ceiling. 
 It was bad - water was pouring out of the 5x Aruba switches that sent network to the rest of the building, about 7/8 of the network was offline. Luckily the server room and about two IDFs not in the chain were fine. Basically, only the basement of the building near the server room, and one random hallway was unaffected.
 After 3 hrs of using a leaf blower to help the internals of the switches dry, I decided to go for broke and connected them back and they all worked! That part of the network was only down for about 4 hours, so in all honesty I think it worked out pretty well, most people were out of the office so it wasn't that much of an interruption.
 It will hold for tonight but I think I'm going to get my 10g network upgrade very soon. Eventually corrosion will kill those switches.

 I'm trying to set up an Apache as a temporary forward proxy. Actually all it has to do is forward everything to the actual proxy server until some client misconfiguration has been sorted out.
 My config works for http connections but all https connections fail.
 here is the virtual host config:
 <VirtualHost *:8001> ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ProxyRequests On ProxyVia On SSLProxyEngine On ProxyRemote "*" "http://xx.xx.xx.xx:9091" </VirtualHost> 
 The error in the log says
 AH01144: No protocol handler was valid for the URL...
 Anyone here can help me out how to get it to work with https? The SSL doesn't need to be terminated on the Apache. Everything should just be shoved to the actual proxy.

 I left the industry just over a year ago, in order to fully commit to my business, and I'm absolutely certain it saved my life.
 Back in 2011 I started working at a small (10 - 40 people) company that managed insurance claims for private companies and public bodies like water boards, regional councils etc - a few years before I left we even managed to secure work with the government, including some government ministries. My main role throughout that time was IT Manager, but as with all small firms, I had to wear several hats - everything from sysadmin through to contract negotiations, and fixing laptop screens.
 Reflecting on my experiences now I think it's a wonder I didn't end up in hospital, or take my own life…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a Windows sysadmin for over 20 years and while I do still enjoy my job, Microsoft is making it harder and harder every month.
 They will either break stuff with updates or the fixes are questionable and you feel like you have to put them off for a month or two just so it doesn't cause any unneeded stress and extra work. If it's not Microsoft killing something then it's a user needing something after hours or on a day off. (I'm the only IT guy for the company which I know will start other conversations but that's not the point of this post)
 I've been getting into Linux here lately and was wondering if a Linux sysadmin position would be any different.
 I guess a lot of it will depend on the company and support structure so it could be possible to jump to a different company/position with the exact same issues that aggravate me now.
 Maybe I'm just getting burned out and looking for something different (less stress and responsibility) but that would require starting over and probably taking a pretty big pay cut.

 Ideally a Windows based solution. We thought of spinning up a new Exchange server, but that seems like massive overkill. We’d like to also keep the traffic on prem.

 I ended up at a large MSP about 2 weeks ago, but I'm starting to regret my decision. The position is remote, the benefits are good and the pay is decent, with no overtime/on-call necessary, but I'm starting to question whether I made the right decision.
 For starters, the position requires a lot more time on the help desk than previously indicated. The documentation is lacking and nobody on my team really seems to know what's going on. Every client's environment is…]]></summary>

 Year 2- RTM happens and it starts to sell well. Company goes public. Two guys no longer care about the product as they are multi-millionaires with hot girlfriends. 
 Year 3- A third party comes in to manage the company. They no longer listen to the community. They look for ways to squeeze more money to investors. Turnover is high. Support is sent offshore to companies who barely speak your language.
 Year 4- Every new release makes the product worse. Every new patch breaks something else. Customers already invested too much time and money to switch products. Customers complain but there's now no one to call or answer emails besides the offshore support company, and they are useless.
 Year 5- Sales start to tank. Company comes up with an idea to bundle the now horrible SW with other products that do sell and turns it into a subscription.
 Year 6- Company is delisted and the SW is sold multiple times to equally horrible companies who try to sunset the product and get you to move to their other more profitable products.

 Year 8- Two guys come with a good idea for a product...

 I'm worried that this role being mostly support ( few change requests, policies, VPN tunnels, VLANs etc. ) could be less benefiting from a career perspective than a more generic network engineer role in an enterprise enviorement ( as it would include maintenance, support, planning , deployment etc.
  
Please share your opinion in the above worries.
 Can you switch into an enterprise role easily after a support role from an MSP?
 How do companies offering contract role view MSP experience?
  
They highlighted that the role is challenging at least 20 times during two interviews and that after 6-12 months project work ( FW deployments, migratons etc. ) can be requested as well.
 Tech stack: - Firewalls: Fortinet, Clavister - Cisco ASR Routers - Switches: Arista, Cumulus - VMWare NSX - NO Automation, NO SD-WAN 
 Tickets are highly variated, examples but not limited to: - Change requests - L2/L3 redundancy - IPSec, SSL VPN, interconnects - Generic R/S TS

 We've just renewed support for our vSphere licensing for 3 years to give the business some runway to figure out if we are going to stick around or not. 
 That gives us time to see how much of a damn dumpster fire this Broadcom deal is going to be, but I figured I would see what others are doing.
 Hyper-V is high on my list as we are a Microsoft shop primarily, but XCP-NG looks favorable too. Red Hat Virtualization seems promising as I have played with oVirt but is daunting to deploy.

 I had to tell them the classic Linux WiFi example from back in the days of forums where you just didn't ask the question or you would end up with dozens of smart-ass comments and no answers or everyone letting you know you are a dumbass ass for not knowing a simple config. You had to pose it as a challenge or insult. They understood.
 The classic Linux WiFi example - When you have a problem you need help with, how you deliver the question makes all the difference in getting a fix. For example if your wifi stopped working on Ubuntu never go on the forum with a question asking for help to get your wifi working. No matter how detailed you are all you will get is snarky comments, RTFM, you are a dumbass, any noob should know that, and no answer. 
 No, if you want a solution quickly simply post "Ubuntu 10.04 Linux is a hacked together piece shit that won't even support wifi on my Lenovo T43. I'm going back to Windows." Now check your post in about an hour and you'll have a hundred comments calling you a dumbass but also another hundred comments with a step-by-step solution just to prove you wrong that wifi does indeed work on Ubuntu. That my friends is how to get answers on the Internet.

Before, on my Windows 2012 VPS, I was using Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to scan it for vulnerabilities that hackers could use to hack into my VPS. Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer was quite good and if my memory is correct, it would also check your ports, check if certain protocols were enabled that hackers could abuse (ie. checked if SMBv1 was enabled), etc, which was really useful.
 Unfortunately, Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) has been discontinued by Microsoft and I don't think the last version is even applicable to Windows Server 2019/2022. Is there another very popular software that administrators use to scan a Windows Server for vulnerabilities and if so, how much does it cost (MBSA was free)?

 My office recently got a lot of Cannon 3226i machines and a cannon 4835 machine. Now I set up the 4835 scan to folder and it took a minute barely.
 But when trying to set up the 3226 scan to folder it will not work. Anything I do wont work. I did the same thing with the 4835 and it keeps giving me the #801 error. Tried updating firmware/installing uniflow online express, making a user dedicated to accessing the shared folder, everything. Always give me a wrong user/pass when trying to connect to the NAS server via machine, and when configuring from the UI always gives me #801 even though the 4835 works perfectly, anyone had the same problem? Going crazy here

 Their website has some pretty good info on it around their security model and how secure they are but of course "they would say that wouldn't they" seems to apply.
 I have a few people who've been using LastPass now asking me what I'd recommend and usually I say to look at Bitwarden or 1Password but this looks quite good.
 Is anyone using them please and if so what's your feedback on the product both for enterprise and individual use?

 It happens cause the system tries to show folders and files from the domain file server
 I've managed to cancel this in windows file explorer, unchecking remember folders and files in folder options but have no idea how to do it in office.
 Also a lot of time for log in screen trying to contact dc.
 Any ideas? This is really annoying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I found a domain search whois type of site that displayed traffic estimates and ranks. For a couple very small sites I know, it estimated <200 visitors in a month, and the rank was like somewhere in the millions. For a much larger site, like cbs.com, it reported/estimated it at top 100 or so, and I think I entered 'facebook.com' and it said #2 at 600MM visitors. I understand these estimates are directional at best, but I thought it was a neat addition to a typical whois search, which doesn't really reveal much these days with GDPR in effect.
 I was using Private Mode on Firefox, so it didn't log in my history, and I can't remember the site now and it's driving me nuts. Anyone have a lead? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! First time posting on this subreddit, so please forgive me for any mistakes. 
 I am starting a company where I will give my partners/users, an android device, which has a few apps they still use to access my service. The concept is kind of like doordash, but perhaps a bit more individual. 
 For this system I have been looking into a few things, among other things the Soto MobiControl system. To give a better insight of what’s needed and why I will provide a short description below.
  
A way to remotely access the devices so that my team can do the debugging in case something goes wrong, instead of having to try and explain to the users what to do. 
 With this I am also looking to heavily restrict what apps can be accessed, and also settings so the device can only be used for its actual purpose, and the chance for problems by pressing something wrong occurring decreases.
 An easy way to automatically set up the devices with the right apps and restrictions, perhaps using a connection to a pc or something along those lines.
  
I have looked a bit into the Soti platform, but as far as I have understood I need a dedicated server with databases and stuff to use their solution, which is per today not an option. 
 The perfect scenario would be a cloud based system for accessing the above mentioned functions, preferably a cheap one too since we are a completely new company with not much money to spend. I am looking forward to you guys’ ideas!

 There's multiple windows laptops (MACs aren't experiencing this issue) that run into an issue in which when they disconnect from the F5 VPN or when the VPN session times out their WiFi connection will drop and AnyConnect will either sit there and say associating to their home WiFi network or say "No Adaptors Available". The issue will persist until either the AnyConnect client/service is ended or the laptop is rebooted.
 Cisco TAC insists it's not AnyConnect. Microsoft doesn't feel like touching it since it's 3rd party software. 
 Our client team has tried every WiFi driver they could get their hands on. They've tried Windows 10 and Windows 11. They've tried a fresh image. All resulted in the same symptoms.
 Has anyone seen these kind of issues before? Any solutions or suggestions?

 Find out that the IT person copied the documentation to the server and threw out the book. They also got rid of immutable backups because it costed to much money.

 I have used, and will continue to use, the example of cracking the verifier, as that has a nice analogy to cracking password hashes on a traditional service like Barkbook. But what is at stake here is whether Mr. Talk, given access to what is stored on our servers, would have the capacity to decrypt Molly’s data. Molly’s 1Password Secret Key means that the answer is no. Mr. Talk would not be able to crack that even if he put every computer on Earth to work on the cracking and ran them for zillions of times the age of the universe. I am happy to use words like “never” and “impossible” for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team is looking at using RedSeal's on prem tool to map our network out. Supposedly you can ingest firewall rules from your devices into the program and it plots out your network for you, showing you what could potentially be exposed to the internet and on what ports so you can review and shutdown any open holes you're not fully aware about or got lost in bad documentation/poor communication issues.
 It's pretty pricy though, the 1st demo I had looked decent but the inventory side of it i've already accomplished via Netbox. I could do the network topology too via Netbox but that's manually entering things in instead of allowing a tool to go out, grab the firewall rules and ingest it properly. I'm sure there's a ansible script method I could use to poll all that info and feed it up into Netbox's api but that's more work then I have the time for currently.
 Was curious if there were any other open source alternatives to this tool or people's thoughts and opinions on it?
 Mostly a RHEL/Ubuntu shop with some Windows hosts peppered throughout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a 31-year-old junior system administrator. 
 Long time lurker here and nonnative English speaker.
 ​
 Prior to my current role I have worked as helpdesk and field support specialist.
 I love computers and am always motivated to play around on my homelab.
 At home I have an ESXi and Hyper-V host with, Windows server with domain stuff, Linux VM’s, OPNsense, Docker, unRAID, VEEAM. I have 11 entry level IT certifications, MCSA, Exchange, LPIC, ITIL, Comptia, CCNA the basic stuff.
 At the moment I work in an office as internal IT in a team with 3 other junior admins. We are the escalation point of the helpdesk which does suck because we still have to do helpdesk work. The helpdesk techs are on the lowest level I have seen in my career, tech and communication wise.
 My coworkers like to waste half of the day talking about Marvel with the helpdesk technicians and all other types of nonsense. (This will not improve with current management and will probably take years to turn around)
 I currently work on IT projects with other teams and my senior colleague which is interesting. But I do not get any useful input from the other junior admins, they prefer slacking off and goofing around. So, I am kind of a one-man army I have only my senior colleague as a sparring partner and he has a full schedule.
 I find it hard to stay motivated, I am the most technically knowledgeable person in IT besides the senior admin and architect. My colleagues do not show any interest in improving and I have to spoon-feed the helpdesk. So it feels like I do all the giving.
 Does anyone have any tips to deal with this?

 I really love the clean single list style of PaloAlto/Juniper firewalls where a rule is a rule, from and to and it works, vs building rules on a per interface basis to build things up.
 What other platforms are Zone / Flow based and in the small business price range? Any open source options?

 We have had issues with techs changing port configs for key systems or taking things out of agg groups because they don't understand what they are used for. Even after these mistakes I would push towards POLP and they would shoot it all down.
 Well today I'm having to rebuild an ESXi cluster due to another issue caused by untrained people having access to key systems. I'm sure when I go to the lead meeting on Wednesday they will still shoot down my suggestions.
 Who else has to deal with this nonsense? I'm all for people leveling up but a production environment is not the place for this.

I wanted to use a smart plug on a POE injector but the device is plugged into a poe switch and I'm not sure if I unplug/turn off the power to the injector will it cut the power to the device if the input to the injector is POE it will still have power from poe, right?
 Does anyone know of any other alternatives i.e. female to female RJ45 poe passthrough device that can remotely cut and restore power?

I can’t see how this would even be possible or even allowed? We require Duo for additional verification but I am sure there are a ton of people that don’t do this.

 What connections would I need specifically for this drive, SAS PCI-E card and cable would I need exactly? The software and usage I think I'm good with, its just sourcing correct compatible hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upcoming project will have us installing cameras on parking lot light poles. Four cameras and a weatherproof NEMA box bolted to the light pole. Inside the box will be an 8 port network switch. Switch will be connected via fiber down the pole and into buried conduit back to the main building.
 The NEMA boxes will be in direct sunlight. It's Florida. It's humid. And also, tt's going to be really effing hot in those boxes.
 I've found a few switches rated up to 60C but I don't think that's high enough, based on our testing. Last summer, we put one of the NEMA boxes in direct sun and put a simple mechanical thermometer inside and it did in fact reach 65C/150F. 
 So... anybody got any ideas that can do PoE (only maybe 50W total) and survive these kinds of environments? Or some other way of doing this?

 I’m thinking of postpone the script and has a medium or something to approve the script after the error has been corrected. 
 PowerAutomate seems promising with the cloud flow + desktop flow integration (premium license). Something along the line of sending email to a monitoring mailbox, extract the body, condition check the extracted body, and call desktop flow to trigger another PowerShell script. 
 Discussed internally and one guy bring up using teams to triggers power automate process. How does this works, does it work with a 1-1 chat or has to be teams channel chat. I looked up google but nothing really pin point my answer. A lot of posts hinted to a teams channel. 
 Anyone has any working automated approval process for scripting or anything similar?

 I solve all kinds of problems and face all kinds of situations without anyone's help.
 I see my other co-workers and they are usually wasting time on social media watching videos, memes or things like that.
 Yesterday we had a brief meeting with the head of the IT department and he said that his goal is that we all get the same payment, even knowing that their level of education is different (I have undergraduate, graduate and I'm studying to get a CCNA certificate) and the others didn't even went to college.
 Honestly, I can't understand why. It seems like all the effort I put in doesn't bring any return and I'm tired of it because when things get tough I'm always "need to be" there to help.

 At my old job we got screwed if we had to work during a holiday week because you'd need over 8 hours before you could get anything extra because overtime and/or comp time only counted for "hours worked" so we'd get straight regular pay unless we worked over 8 hours.

 I am able to connect to the tftp server on udp/69 but the data transfer to copy the data on an alternate udp port seems be blocked. I have permitted all udp ports on the security group for the instance, but not luck. Does anyone know of any other location in AWS / VPC that may block udp traffic of a tftp server?
 I was able to verify that the tftp server does work. I am able to transfer data via tftp within a VPC subnet. It does not work when the traffic is coming from outside the VPC 
 Also I tested two different tftp servers, tftp64 on windows, and in.tftpd on Linux,.and the same behavior occurs on each system. 
 To reiterate. Connections on port udp/69 work. The file name comes through to the server and the server creates the file name to be written to. But the data stream that transfers the actual file data on an alternate udp port seems to be blocked and no data is written to the file. 
 I am stuck, but would like to learn more about AWS plumbing. And felt this might be a pertinent issue to other folks on this sub.

I have several users on the strict policy, but I don't like that it's immutable, i.e., no granular control. And it seems to stop processing rules below its priority, so incompatible settings never get applied. For instance, it won't allow the first contact warning tags, and it isn't campatible with spam notifications and letting the users release their own. I don't need all that work. So my question is: Is there anything the presets do that can't be done by building my own policies? Can I still get the same level of impersonation protection, etc.? Thx!

 ​
 ​
 I will design DFS-N environment for my company. But I have some your valueable ideas.
 ​
 1 - (Option 1 )DFS-N multi namespaces for each department or (Option 2) DFS-N single namespace for all department. What's best practices for this ?
 ​
 I want to config very manageable structure.
 ​
 ​
 Option 1 :

 ​
 Option 2 :

 ​
 ​
 ​
 2- What's best practices for those permissions for DFS-N environment? I will setup something like that. 
 ​
 ​
 e.g
 ​
 ​
 DFS NameSpace Name : DATA
 ​
 ​
 Permissions : (Everyone removed, & Authenticated Users = Read) under Customize and FULL Control for Administrators
  \-- IT (Folder) --> Folder Target : NS\_IT 
 NS_IT : Sharing Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 NTFS Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 ​
 ​
 ​
 3 - I will use Item-level Targeting for drive mapping. I will use Security Groups. Also I want to do the drive mapping for each department.
 ​
 So , G for IT DePartment ,H for HR Deparment and so on. 
 ​
 Lets say , any user moved from the IT department to the HR department. How can I manage the GPO here?
 ​
 ​
 Now I have tested it. I have created a GPO like below.
 ​
 But , although the user moves to the HR department, IT sharing mapping still remains.
 ​
 GPO:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 We are planning to migrate Azure AD Connect from version 1.6.x to the latest version on a new server, via the staging mode method. I already did this in the past, and the process is quite straightforward.
 But in this context, this is a bit different. In the initial configuration of Azure AD Connect, ADFS was configured as the sign-in method. So, during the the AAD Connect wizard on the new server, we have to choose « Federation with ADFS » at the « Sign-in » step, and then, selecting the existing ADFS farm.
 My main concern is about the next step "Azure AD domain": (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/media/how-to-connect-install-custom/adfs6.png)
 We have several federated domains, and here we can choose only one. What will be the impact for all the other ones ? And also for the one that I will select ? All these domains are already correctly federated, I don't really understand what will happen at this step. Do we have to expect user impact ?
 Thanks for your help. Kevin

We outsource at the moment to a well known hosted platform in Ireland but the support is terrible and we want our own system we can manage internally. It must be a server based application and not an appliance as we host at AWS.
 I have been doing some googling and some old recommendations seems to be Squid with DansGuardian ( we prefer Linux based platforms ) but i notice DansGuardian is no longer a thing. E2Guardian seemed to take over but that also no longer seems to be active.
 Can anyone recommend a current open source platform we can use that can be cloud based on our own server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might not be a place to showcase but do you folks think this projects has a good ground? From my experience it's useful because it can solve the following scenarios for me:
 - While interning at a company the devs were in bed and suddenly the service went down, no-one had the willingness to get up and SSH into the server and fix it. Fix was a restart. Overenergetic intern was willing but not granted SSH access since even with minimal permissions it's a security risk and interns cannot be trusted with production server.
 - While interning as a backend dev, push to staging branch auto deployed the changes, but since maintaining SSH credentials for every employee/intern is tedious, I had to Slack call the server person and get a screenshot of logs which was a pain
 ​
 MobXcess is a tool suite that can run commands 🛠️ on your server☁️ from your mobile📱 device securely
 PS: No SSH Needed 🤫🙅‍♂️
 MobXcess is developed in two parts:
  
Server-Side system developed using Golang
 Client-Side system developed using Flutter
  
The communication is secured using AES-256-GCM cryptography.
 Since it's a REST API, adding SSL will elevate security to a new level.

 merry xmas!
 Does anyone know if there is a source with all the IP Ranges used by Microsoft Autenticator? We would like to use the Location part of the new number-matching feature of Microsoft Authenticator.
 However, since we are using a web proxy it keeps showing a location very far away from where the user actually sits (depending on web proxy location - ZScaler in our environment). The idea would be to exclude the IPs from ZScaler in order to get real and authentic location information.
 How did you solve the issue?
 The obvious alternative would be to deactivate the location matching in the Authenticator but we actually like the feature.

Working at an MSP, one of our clients was a nation wide radio station that had special uptime requirements. And naturally, like many an organization, we also had an on-call agent for weekends and holidays.
 So it is Christmas morning, I wake up to a phone call from our on-call agent who also happens to be the senior architect/engineer/sysadmin/flavor of the day. "Are you still in town?" Without thinking, I stupidly answered "yes". That was how I got to spend Christmas day traveling hours to a rural radio tower and replacing a dead firewall.
 Turns out, everyone else was smarter than me, the architect included, and were all "out of town".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a little ways into an MSP job that requires daily standup meetings that often run for 90 minutes or more. I'm making my best effort to pay attention and take notes (if for no other reason than to force myself to focus), but I often find myself tuning out anyway. And I won't know until several minutes into a topic discussion that my boss is going to conclude the discussion by assigning the matter to me, whether or not my attention span had failed me 45 minutes into the meeting.
 Which brings me to my point: I need technology assistance here. What software solutions can the community recommend to live transcribe these meetings using the microphone on an Intel Macbook Pro? Unfortunately, it looks like the built-in Mac live caption software only works on Apple silicon. I'm willing to pay money if that's what it takes, but hoping to avoid shelling out for full-blown Dragon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel as if Azure ADDS is extremely limited, I realize that it isn't a replacement for ADDS, but being cloud only and having multiple vendors who use/integrate LDAP, it seems that Azure ADDS has very limited functionality. No way to integrate ADDS into Azure ATP, Cannot do custom delegation, one way sync from Azure and if I want to move groups to different OU's, I'm having to create them in ADDS, but can't reverse sync them to Azure, machines also don't hybrid join, so having a hard time with intune GPOs, the list could go on...
 Recommendations? I think having devices join to AAD is great with Intune, but I don't think being cloud-only for identities, and not having an on-prem instance is ideal.
 Ideally, I'm thinking we leave the environment in it's current state, but move identities on-prem, including groups, and sync everything via AD Connect, while leaving machines joined to AAD, so on-prem won't really need to be open all over with VPN tunnels flying around, just for the purpose of syncing objects, servers, VM's, etc and far better management. Thoughts?

 We currently have 3 ESXi 6.7 hosts connected to a 140TB HPE Nimble CS-1000 on 10gbps iScsi. This Nimble only has 4TB of deduplication capacity. The Unity 380 we were quoted is 384TB with the first shelf (about 74TB) being all SSD, the remaining capacity is 7200 rpm HDDs. 
 Looking for advice and opinions on HPE vs. EMC in this configuration. Most of our storage usage comes from Windows 2016/19 file server VMs.
 How would you compare HPE Nimble to EMC Unity especially in regard to deduplication?
 All of our ESXi hosts are Dell R750s (upgrading from R730s)
 Thank you for any help or advice.

 Fuck em. I make less now than when I was hired due to inflation, and it's like that across all departments. If you're not at the exec level, they don't care about CoL.

 Working with python and go have just felt awful for me, especially the xml, json and expect stuff.
 Shell scripting feels a bit more natural since I don't spend time reinventing the wheel on a ton of functions and I can just pipe to other programs. It's like a black box. I throw in some input and out comes what I need. It's not without it's issues either.

 I'm curious what eventual upgrades I could do via optics/switch upgrade, but I'm not sure what the fastest BiDi speeds would be. 
 I see 25G-SFP28 exists so it looks like 25G is an option, but is there any higher or would it become QSFP at that point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to add some temperature monitoring to two small server rooms in two different buildings. We're a small shop without a lot of budget for this. The Internet connection for these locations is pretty solid. 
 Ideally, I want a simple sensor we can just data cable (not WiFi) to a switch, with a basic cloud based server. It would alert us (via text, email, or app notification) when the temperature goes outside of a specified range or when it loses connectivity or fails to report within a certain time period. And last, keep a record of temperature reported so, when it loses connection, we can see what the trend was. 
 It seems to me this is a decently big ask on a small budget, but I thought I'd reach out and see if anyone has an experience or recommendations in this field. So far Google has brought up a bunch of options without much context of what is a good option and what is not.

 New IT Director wants me to "Spin up a Guest Wi-Fi". They want this to be 100% isolated from the intranet. Our environment is relatively simple - We run SonicWall firewall for any external communication, with a L3 core switch for all internal routing. Server stacks on each floor for access. Ruckus with Virtual Smart Zone for the AP's/controller. This is true for all (8) locations. Our uplink to the SonicWall is through VLAN 60, which is also our corporate Wi-Fi. All AP's are untagged for VLAN 60, as is the SonicWall uplink. 
 They're not looking to spend any money or add any new equipment for this task, and would like it done early next week. Its Friday, so about 2 working days. They would ideally like something ready for testing in about... an hour.

 We're a medium sized MSP (250 employees) and we're currently using LastPass and in the light of what happened we're really unsure of what service to continue with, and currently leaning towards not continuing with LastPass. But before we decide fully we want to do some evaluating on LastPass. Our Yearly subscription renews at the start of February and so we decided we want to switch to a monthly payment play in order to not commit to a full year.
 So on hold for their billing support for 1H because you cant cancel auto subscription on your own, you have to call them.
 Then they proceed to tell me that they dont have a monthly subscription, only monthly billing. Meaning I will still be committed for a year even if I pay monthly.
 So I essentially tell them that in that case I will have to cancel because I don't want to commit for a year
 They respond with saying "Go ahead cancel then because we only do yearly subscriptions".
 Honestly, hope they go under.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a small GUI-based tool that uses the Windows Imaging Format (WIM) to create full backups of computer systems (operating system images) and then restore them.
 The application is hosted on GitHub, is open source, and is offered under the Apache 2.0 license.
 In addition, the repository includes an illustrated step-by-step guide to help get it up and running.
 Maybe someone can use the solution for their purposes as well - I would be happy. Have fun with it.
 Brief summary:
  
WIM backup always requires an external bootable media such as a USB flash drive.
 From this drive WinPE is booted to perform a backup or restore to or from an external medium (e.g. a USB hard drive).
 On the bootable USB flash drive the WinPE must be set up before (is documented illustrated in the readme).
 After completion of the respective operation, a status message is displayed whether the operation was successful or failed.
 After restoring a backup, you can boot normally from the destination drive.
 Both the backup and restore process are relatively simple (not "rocket science").
 To set up the solution, you need about 30 minutes time in the best case due to the necessary downloads (e .g. ADK)
  
The project can be found here: WIM-Backup

 "I understand that you have gotten a verification/registration email for a computer that your organization does not recognize, my name is Dionne, and I am happy to help. However, I apologize, but we can't see where the installations of products are made from. My apologies.

 So basically, they have no way to track where their software is installed . So they should not be relied on when they want you to pay for more licenses for more seats since they cant prove anything.

 I'm UK based.
 I'm in the fortunate position to have a decent job as a cloud engineer, working primarily on Azure and on premise infrastructure.
 I've been offered 2 roles, with a varying jump in salary. 
 Role 1: 90k but as a lead on a project.
 Role 2: 75k but with a support network around, and potentially a progression plan.
 ​
 I'm quite conflicted as to what to do. I'm confident in my own abilities and like the sound of more money, but would feel like I'd benefit from a support network around me. 
 What would you guys do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advice on Mitel VOIP appliances. Recently joined the business and there is a Mitel VOIP appliance in play for the usual VOIP business requirements. Took a look at the setup and at first glance there is some good practice: the VOIP is hosted on linux servers sitting in their own VLAN segmented from the rest of the network. The only public facing server is the Mitel's conference bridge suite. 
 But there is something i dont understand cause i lack experience with this VOIP software - 1) the controller is being hosted on a Windows OS, iirc its supposed to be on Linux boxes, 2) the devices are domain joined - so i assume the creds of our admins when they are logging in and out of the Windows OS VOIP controller, will be leaving their creds behind in memory no? Or even a LSASS dump could result in compromise of any domain admins that have administered the Mitel suite in the separate VLAN? Am I panicking over nothing here?
 Seems kind of obvious to me that eventually someone will pop the internet-facing conference bridge, move to the Windows OS controller server in the same VLAN, and then dump creds until they find one that can break them out of the VOIP VLAN and get into the rest of the network. 
 Any thoughts?
 Should the Mitel VOIP stuff be domain joined? 
 Should any of the VOIP VMs be a Windows OS?
 Is this setup as vulnerable as i feel it is?

 I would like to setup a personal lab for PowerShell practice/testing, which I can't do at work, and for which I can't accommodate the tin (or a VM) at home.
 Is there a facility where I can have a suitably isolated hosted VM as if an "on prem" DC with AD services, which I can then sync with a Tenancy in AAD/365? 
 I could just buy a vanity domain + DNS hosting, a hosted VM with Windows Server Licence, link to a Tenancy, and go from there - but even for just a half-dozen dummy users with an E1 or two thrown in, my test bed is costing a sizeable chunk of salary.
 Conversely, though, I recognise any hosting is going to incur some cost, and that's "fine".
 Any suggestions please?

 yesterday at around 3pm the our Hyper-V server started running hot and the fans were on full blast. Due to the exchange being there etc. I couldn't restart it before 9pm from home.
 Today at 7am I arrived in the server room and it was super hot (temps said 30 degrees) so I remoted in, powered it off and unplugged it.
 I then carried up a mobile a/c and turned it on to 17 degrees, the a/c inside the server room at 18 degrees (both on high) and turned it on again.
 It's now 12am, and the fans still run at 100%, Hyper-V manager doesn't show any significant VM load (around 2% CPU max.).
 What could the issue be? I opened the door so cold air gets in from the floor, and the a/c's are still running. The fans should start powering down once the room cools down, no? 
 How come it still runs at a 100% even though it's significantly cooler there now?

 Obviously I'm only looking at industrial grade high level CFs, not the cheap 10$ ones for cameras

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI all,
 ​
 Looking for genuine opinions whether Microsoft Unified Support is bringing you value for money if you are using it.
 Yes it is quite pricey, but we are going all in in Azure and 365 and have struggled with getting good quality support from partners so are looking for alternatives.
 Most times we get support from MS, the initial engagement is problematic, but once I start having conversations (moaning...) with our MS account managers and they escalate the incidents to the right person, issues get resolved promptly. It appears that having Unified Support may well get you to the 'right person' quickly. 
 ​
 Cheers

The first sync time was 12:12 at night. Although we did not make any settings changes regarding this, it started to not receive new updates. By the way, when we synced manually, it was getting new updates but showing its status "fail". When I changed the sync time yesterday, I saw that new updates have arrived but its status still shows as "fail". How can i solve this problem. I don't want to reinstall wsus server. Is there anything I can do? Thanks in advance. Best wishes.

 100 user company on 365 business premium, hybrid environment, roughly 10TB of data, hosted on-prem right now.
 What is the easiest lift that can keep file/folder permission in place and allows easy mapping via GPO? I'm working on getting Intune/AutoPilot set up, testing how the enrollment process works in a hybrid environment now. Haven't seen to many examples for hybrid specific in my research, but I digress. 
 Obviously we have a company OneDrive, I believe 1 TB for biz prem, I would think you could increase the capacity for a fee. Issue is permissions are not a one to one from my understanding. SharePoint is also an option but again, kind of a mess for management in my limited experience. And now there is Azure Files, that seems promising but being my first foray into Azure, seems pricey. 
 Ideally I don't want to redo any permissions and need to have a reliable way to map drives for users. Curious to see what others have done. Thanks in advance

 I am in the process of revamping our service desk team to shift their mindset from reactive to tickets coming in the desk to proactive with a focus on ticket reduction through anticipating customer needs, automation to streamline/free You resources and delivering white glove service.
 I am curious to hear any success stories on areas you’ve focused and seen great success in addition to red flags/issues that came up with unintended consequences.
 Some of the areas of focus for 2023 are: - improve work from home experience and technology performance - conduct a monthly “check up” With all employees with at least 3 being video - revamp onboarding experience and shorten day 1 orientation timeframe - while supporting an issue, proactively review drivers/vulnerabilities/windows updates and address those before logging off.
 These are just a few examples of ways that we’re focused on prevention/proactive/mindset shift
 Any feedback on things that have/have not worked for you?
 Greatly appreciate the insight.

I have generated an installer and an xml file from config.office.com. 
 I have downloaded all the relevant files with the /download switch in the batch file
  
Im having some issues when it comes to trying to install
  
My install O365.bat file is located in \\DC\netlogon\Office Deployment Upgrade: https://imgur.com/a/MKfK17F I have the @pushd and @popd in this batch file becuase the file is in a network location. It was the only way I could allow this file to be ran on an end user machine
 When I run this file I get an error message around the files not being able to be downloaded: https://imgur.com/a/Ouw61rt
  
Im also needing to figure out how to push this batch file once and only once so it only uninstalls 2013 and upgrades once. Wether I use PDQ or a one time scheduled task im not sure. 
 I have been at this for days and im yet to figure it out
 If anyone can assist that would be great

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you ready for this nightmare story?
 I have a Virtual environment (VMWare, Microsoft) and lost everything on the SAN including VMs and backups. Data recovery is in the process but it will take weeks at best and I am not getting any high confidence from the data recovery team. I have an online backup of user data but no viable backup of the actual DC or any other servers that I can restore. I say that, but there is a remote possibility that I can restore my DC from 6 months ago when we upgraded from 2008 to 2022 and swapped roles, etc., however, that is looking like a pipe dream as well (this would be the 2008 server).
 It is a Hybrid Office 365 environment with on-prem DCs and Azure AD (free) for authentication and all. I am assuming that if I were to create everything from scratch (new Forest and DC) there is a high likelihood of all mailboxes getting affected as well because the on-prem SIDs and GUIDs and Object IDs would be different from what they were previously. Waiting for weeks isn't happening but I need at least some domain functions back to survive the carnage.
 I am looking for some bright ideas to get out of this mess!!!!
 My terrible options at the moment are:
  
Create everything from scratch and deal with hybrid issues later
 Hope and try to restore the DC from 6 months ago and minimize the impact to only new users from that point on.
 Can Azure AD be the savior here? - Can the information in the cloud be used to spin up a DC in the cloud? - If that is possible, does this mean I am not fully cloud-based domain environment, or can I then also have an on-prem spun up later?
  
I am sure there are some bright minds out there to help navigate this mess.
 Thank you!!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a year ago, my manager let me know he was going to be moving to another team and my department director would like to promote me to my manager's position. Nice! Over the following months this shifted to, "we have to post the position and you'll need to apply, but you're our candidate of choice." Interviews were earlier this month and I didn't make it past the first round of interviews. My director pulled me aside afterwards to say that I interviewed well, but he had decided to look for someone with more experience. It sucks but business can be that way, I'll just keep my resume updated.
 ​
 Later, it was dropped that the new manager won't be meeting with our team at any point during the interview process. This manager will also report to two directors; during my interview it became clear they had directly opposing ideas of what the new manager should achieve, (director 1 said it would be the new manger's job to take on work from their team and say no to new work from director 2, director 2 said exactly the opposite), and it very much gave me "divorced parents arguing through the kids" vibes.
 ​
 After thinking about this for a bit, I never would entertain an offer like this if it had come from another organization. If I was applying for a manager role and couldn't meet the team at least once and was expected to report to multiple directors with directly opposing expectations, I never would consider the role!
 ​
 While it sucks that I was strung along for so long, I'm grateful that it helped me see that this probably wasn't a position I would be happy with, and that a healthy organization probably wouldn't make these kinds of decisions.

These encrypted fields remain secured with 256-bit AES encryption and can only be decrypted with a unique encryption key derived from each user’s master password using our Zero Knowledge architecture. As a reminder, the master password is never known to LastPass and is not stored or maintained by LastPass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I have one domain in the forest, and the domain currently has 4 Domain controllers. One DC is obviously holding the FSMO roles. I just noticed that the FSMO role holder is also a GC. Now in the past i've never paid any mind to this, and the domain seems fine... for years even. But Looking at the microsoft instructions for moving FSMO roles, they clearly state: "Do not put the infrastructure Master FSMO role on a GC".
 Why? My domain seems to be running fine. Whats the difference between a DC that is not a Global Catalog, and one that isnt? Can it still be used the same way?
 I only have one DC at this particular site, if i switch off GC, will everything still function correctly?(Auth, Kerberos, etc).
 ​
 My other Domain controllers are also Global catalogs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's a better subreddit for this let me know, but I'm having a lot of trouble and dealing with very poor documentation and hoping someone else has tried this. 
 I am primarily the video guy at an arts center, but since my venue went to NDI I have also become the defacto sysadmin for our dedicated video network. It's not fancy - we have a Netgear M4250 managed switch driving the network, and then a bunch of CAT6 run through the walls to our endpoints. I'm trying to add wireless for easier troubleshooting and access to the GUIs for my devices. I thought this would be easy (lol). That's the context, now here's the problem:
 I have installed the Ubiquiti Unifi Network application on my Windows 10 laptop, plugged both the laptop and the U6-LR into the switch (PoE+ capable), and am trying to "adopt" it to my Unifi network on the Windows app. That's what the documentation covers. However, the adoption always fails, then asks me to "enter the device credentials that were set on the previously installed location under network device ssh authentication." Except that I didn't set any of that - this thing is brand new out of the box. I press the "forget" button, which says "the device will be restored to facotry settings". That sounds like exactly what I need, but in practice it just starts this loop over again. Same if I hit the hardware reset button. Adoption failed.
 I'm stumped. Does anybody have any idea what I'm doing wrong?

 Our users have recently been receiving undeliverable messages stating they are the sender and recipient. Mainly because of the way the mail flow rule is setup against dmarc failures. 
 Clearly the messages are phishing. I’m wondering the best way we could handle these? I was thinking I just create a mail flow rule to say if anyone inside the organization receives a message with the body text matching what the custom NDR rule outputs to just drop the message. 
 Thoughts?

What am I missing, and yes I did swap the tx and rx on the patch cable just in case it was crossed somewhere.

 There is a situation that has to be resolved:
 In AD there is a file server srv002 with shared folders Folder1, Folder2, etc.
 The server is running out of space. It was decided to add another server srv003 which has sufficient disk space and use DFS to 'distribute' data between the servers.
 The other intention is not to change paths to which users have got used.
 Is that all possible?
 I am testing with one of the shared folders that exists and cannot get the same namespace...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty new in my role. Graduated with a year of work experience in IT and went straight into systems administration, have been doing it for almost 2 months. But god it feels so much longer than that. I'm also the only IT person at an organisation with ~250 people.
 A lot of people lack basic IT skills, which is totally fine, that's why we have IT people. Except they get so mad when I ask them to make sure their username/password is correct, or if their cable is in properly or if they're trying to log into the right platform. People don't understand resolving IT issues isn't always instantaneous and sometimes we need to wait for equipment to be delivered. It seems that I'm often expected to resolve everything Right Now and people get frustrated and upset when that doesn't happen. 
 It's a bit overwhelming to be honest, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything. I got 3 day of training before the last sysadmin left. I'm not sure how you guys deal with people who are rude/impatient/irritated. I also get frustrated at the bad communication and poor common sense. Anyone got any advice for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I have a cheap dell t310 with hba sas card and 16gb ram with a zfs1 pool on n°4 sas HD 4tb 7200 rpm each without compression.
 I use proxmox on dell perc raid with 4ssd raid5 hardware managed, where I run some VM and container saved inside the SSD lvm raid and the zfs pool is only for my works files storage with samba with a 2gbps network bonding.
 Also I have an unused 4 old 10k sas disk of 250gb each.
 My question is: - the zfs1 pool has 3X read speed gain but no write speed gain.
 Want to have the sense to install one small sas 10k as a log disk for zfs to speed up write operations?
 If yes, I can work only with a LOG disk or if I add a log also I need to add a cache disk?
 Really thank you

 The kind of functionality I need is basically a database of what orders and invoices we have, but then some form of dashboard showing which ones are coming up for review/renewal. I did my research and came across Tradogram. Has anyone ever used them before?

 I hope the hive mind has some input on this.
 We have a legacy application that uses SMBv1. We have recently stood up a new site in AD with a new domain controller. Devices in this site are unable to open the SMB share via \\hostname, but are able to connect via \\IP.-.add.ress.
 Wireshark shows me " KRB5KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOSUPP ", but zero configuration changes between the devices in site A and site B. I've literally moved VM's from one site to another and have it work in A but not B).
 Site A:
  
DC running server 2019
 XP SMBv1 share
 Clients can connect to SMB share
  
Site B:
  
DC running server 2022
 clients cannot connect to SMB share
  
​
 As a test, I've associated the subnets of Site B with site A in AD sites & services. After a reboot, the devices are able to connect to the SMB share.
 So that leads me to believe there's an issue with the DC in site B, but I'm unsure what/where.
 ​
 Any tips would be very welcome!

 I am a junior Sysadmin for a NGO and we are planning to upgrade our network infrastructure.
 We are using D-Link managed switches (layer 3 functionallities for backbone, access layer 2, ..) and I was looking for good, sustainable alternatives. The D-Link swiches are doing their job but they aren´t that good to handle for my favour.
 While looking up some alternatives I´ve noticed that I dont know that much about the differences between switches from different manufactures.
 Since I´m rarely active in this Community I though I just ask you and maybe join the discussion.
 Maybe some of you could list their favourite piece of hardware they love working with and shortly state why? :)
 It would be nice to get some advice for middleclass price options aswell.

 I'm a noob, straight out of Uni and doesn't really have any experience. Work has been getting hectic lately and there is a good chance that I might get fired/ let go.
 TBH I'm mentally exhausted as well. It's just everyone is really smart and I feel like I'm being a dead weight. 
 My boss/manager is a really kind person. They really want me to succeed and encourage me a lot. But I feel like it's a bit too late for that. There is a pretty good chance that I might be let go due to my performance. 
 I was wondering that, how bad would it look if I get fired from my very first IT job?
 Considering the situation, how can I make it as easy as possible for everyone.?
 Any advice or help would be appropriated.

 The SOAR we are going to use is Shuffle.
 What can be achieved with those integrations and what are the differences? How do those systems work together in the SOC environment? 
 Are the cases updated automatically in TheHive with the information from MISP/Cortex or should they be configured to be updated automatically if certain conditions are matched with a SOAR?
 Is it a good practice to use both MISP and Cortex?

 I ensured that the ADFS is working via this (internal) link: https://xxxadfsservernamexxx.local/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx
 I believe this is an issue with the certificate. That is because during trial and error I got different errors related with the certificate. Like: "Error occurred while adding trusted root certificates""com.vmware.vapi.std.errors.Error" "Certificate bearing subject""is not a valid CA certificate""Please retry with a valid certificate chain".
 We have a CA in the domain and newly created Windows 2022 ADFS server. 
 I have followed the steps in this link: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78029
 But there is no clear instructions on what certificate to export and import or how to generate one or whatsoever. I am missing this part. Do I need to get a certificate from ADFS server? From the CA server? What format? How to export? What is a chain? Any idea on how to handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I will post this in the IT Careers subreddit as well, but I feel like this sub has helped me incredibly and I greatly respect the opinions of us folk who are in the trenches daily.
 I took a position as a entry level help desk technician at an MSP a few years ago with no experience. I was stagnant in my previous line of work and wanted to try something new (I’m in my mid 30s). In a few years, I’ve learned a LOT, obtained the triad of CompTIA certs, VMware cert, CCNA, and some Azure certs. I assist in managing our VIP clients, and have been promoted 4 times to get near the top of the food chain on the help desk (about 50 of us).
 I love the type of work I do and it just clicks for me, but a huge downside for me is OT. I understand there is OT for every position out there. That’s part and parcel of work. But the daily 1-3 hours (and weekends) of maintenance and troubleshooting the inevitable issues that arise from that work each night is just something I will not continue to do. Give me 40-42 hours a week. Take your money. I want the time off, away from the office. I’m not going to spend 12 hours a day working when I have a wife and 2 kids at home. It’s just too much, I’m burnt out quickly, and I can’t give my family my full, undivided attention they deserve on a daily basis.
 Are there any options out there for me that I can work my way to that is a more traditional “9-5” job in the IT world? When I’m done for the day, I want to leave my work at work. Obviously a sysadmin role at a company is out of the question. Am I more suited for a solutions role or pre sales? Sales? Account management? I’ve only been in the industry for 5 years so I’m fairly new to what options may even be available for me, if any. So I’m at the point where I need to decide if another career move may be needed. 
 Any advice at all would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! As the title suggests ive been tasked to look for a self-service tool that provides temporary local admin rights. Right now all of our users have local admin rights on their work devices which is a security risk we would like to mitigate.
 Points to consider are:
  
straight forward administration of the tool
 the tool should be easy to understand for the user
 there should be a way to evaluate who / when / how long someone requsted local admin rights
 it should be possible to determine the duration of the requested admin rights
 Company of about 200 - 300 users
 We are using Microsoft 365 E3
  
Questions we asked ourselves are:
  
Why do coworkers actually need local admin rights?
 can the tool / software be automatically be updated with our images without admin rights?
 can devicedrivers still be installed with manufacturer tools like Dell SupportAssist?
  
As it stands right now in my research on the subject i stumbled upon the tool EAM (Emergency Admin Manager) from dynasys, which looks kind of promising.
 I was curious if any of you have a useful suggestion or better solution to my problem at hand (im still fairly inexperienced and just started my first job)
 im grateful for any help, thank you very much!

 Using the latest build of Purple Knight by Semperis, I'm unable to view/save the PDF report. It seems that the new build is unable to generate the PDF file, I always get a message "Failed to save security assessment report.

 The previous build was working correctly on the same machine.
 Anyone with the same issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all Got a call this morning from a prospective customer who is in pretty bad shape. 
 Ransomware'd, majority of data lost and no backups. They switched off all on-prem domain controllers soon as one of their techs noticed weird behaviour.
 Their only saving grace are two domain controllers running in Azure, showing no signs of infection and pretty segregated away from their on-premise environment and adequately backed up.
 I've been brought in as a secondary pair of eyes to relieve the pain on the lone tech on the ground.
 I'd be grateful if you could validate our approach below and any suggestions and pointers you could provide to work around any dangers you may see.
 Approach I'm thinking of taking is, once we're 100% the DCs in the cloud are unimpacted
  
Build clean network
 
Perform authoritative restore of the dc in the cloud into a new on-premise virtual machine
 
Install AD and configure roles onto the new VM
 
Restore system state data from the backup to new VM using Windows Backup Utility
 
Boot new VM into DRSM and run ntdsutil command to start Directory Services Utility
 
Use authoritative restore sub-command to mark relevant objects as authoritative
 
Commit, restart
 
Perform deep AD Health Check
 
 In terms of FSMO roles - unfortunately they were all on one of the on-prem domain controllers, now powered down - would this simply be a case of seizing the roles once I've configured the new on-prem DC properly?

 I've been working at an MSP but as a consultant for a sister company that sells ERP. My job is solving technical issues (most of the time small network probs or an update that gets stuck), and some internal helpdesk.
 I've been offered a job at a place for internal IT with a 33.3% raise in pay. When i offered my dismissal HR replied kinda cold, no counteroffer what so ever.
 Now one day before i leave i got an offer with a raise of 50% with a car in the package.
 I'm at a crossroads here and i was hoping I would get some opinions on what i should do.
 Help?

 For reasons I won’t go into, I’m in a need to setup a M365 subscription (E3 Enterprise, likely with the security addons on later) pretty quickly for a business which will host ~1000 users. 
 For these subscriptions, I need to contact the Microsoft sales team. I’ve done this but they’ll take a few days to get back to me (which over Christmas will likely take a bit longer)
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/e3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab
 Are there any other ways of spinning up this tenant without engaging a human?
 I’ve noticed E3 Business subscriptions can be done directly from the portal. Can I just sign up for this and then upgrade? Or is this going to cause issues later?
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab
 Any other options appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a fairly small shop. Staffed mostly by young developers. We like to have fun when we can, in the past this was done by playing URT on slow days or before holidays. In the last two years there's been a lot of turnover and current folks just aren't into it damn kids.
 So after sneakily gathering intel for the last two months I've gathered that they ALL like to play minecraft. Surprise!
 So, tomorrow as a end of the year gift the company will be playing a Ya-dead-ya-dead minecraft game in a server I spent today building. We're confident most employees have already purchased the game but I've gotten an approved PO to purchase a personal copy for any employee who doesn't so they can join in, and it's theirs. Ties to their personal accounts. 
 I spent the day preparing a full java minecraft package, to deploy at 11:59pm tonight to all systems, and have a custom message that will be pushed at 10am directing users play some minecraft and join xyz server. 
 Once they join everyone will start at a specified point with some messages to read regarding the "game". They'll have the entier day to build the most elaborate home + an attempt to reach "the end". Most likely nobody will get there as its hardcore. Also, if you die you're dead. They've all been provided a named box with the same supplies to help them get started, food and a map.
 Its not much but I'm really happy I was able to get this approved and am able to give the company a few hours of fun before the holidays.
 Any ideas on change to the theme of the game for more fun? I thought YDYD would lead to good braging rights theme. We do have some sales, Admin, and HR folks but they're already all GONE for the holiday. It's literally just a bunch of very young devs and myself for tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two servers with their own 10gb NICs installed and I'm trying to get an iperf test to make sure all looks good. The issue is that I can't make the connection. I'm using openmediavault as my server and in it I've configured the main port of each NIC with it's own IP.
 Server 1 NIC IP = 172.16.61.8 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 Server 2 NIC IP = 172.16.61.9 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 ​
 On server 1 I'm running this on iperf:
 iperf3 -s -B 172.16.61.9
 ​
 On server 2 as the client:
 iperf3 -c 172.16.61.9 -B 172.16.61.8
 ​
 But when I run this it just hangs for 2 minutes and then says 'iperf3: error - unable to send control message: Bad file descriptor'
 ​
 What am I missing here? I'm calling the IP for the server's 10gb nic and establishing my local server's 10Gb IP as well but just not making a connection

 What I’ve done so far; 
 I’ve got a L2TP vpn to work between the two and I see the device via IP. But can’t access the device since the proprietary software doesn’t see it. (mDNS / Bonjour doesn’t transfer over VPN)
 What are my options here ? How can I make it work. Do I need any specific hardware ?

OK. It's only been 2% for several years anyway. So not great. My reviews are exceeds to all of you managers. So I'm not just disgruntled. I'm pretty good at what I do. So what else is going to suck? We have to do after-hours support every three weeks for a full week. They are not going to pay us though. We have to volunteer. Now, in IT we've all canceled family vacations and lost money on plane tickets, yada yada.. It's not just happening to me personally, it's my team. My direct manager is great, and so is my IT director. They are very good human beings. I can't stress that enough. Mr. Rogers's territory nice. "Good people" if you're from the American Midwest. You know what that term means.
 I got a Teams call today from HR. I had used the F word in an email to my wife on 19 Dec 2023 at 0759 EST. I have a company phone and I had used a company phone to say the F-word in an email. OK fine. I violated company policy. I will endeavor to be mindful in the future when using my mobile phone, not to say the F-word or any other word that people find offensive. That list gets updated yearly. 
 I said to the HR rep " you called to chew me out about email usage, but a multi-billion dollar company is refusing to pay the IT department overtime when we actually work overtime? Can you see why I might be upset? You are not solving problems, you're just making problems up. You never just say thank you to us". The HR rep said, "Well, I guess you're thanked with a paycheck". 
 For the first time in 16.5 years, I started updating my resume. I can't continue to "volunteer".

 I'm looking for community opinion and experience related to the 6wind products in general, particularly with 6wind vsr solutions.
 I've been testing it pretty intensively and already have some understanding. However, it would be nice if anybody can share their experience with the company and its products.
 For now, my specific case is a branch VPN router, but I have a few more places where they might fit, just lack external information and have to stick to their corporate website only.

 Example: I have a 200Mbps L2 circuit plugged in to a 1Gb port on an Arista switch. There's a bunch of output discards and I found myself wondering if it best practice (or would even make a difference) to shape the interface down to 200000Kbps. I attempted to do this as a test (rate shape 200000 kbps) and it didn't change the incrementing output discards (but I'm fairly certain I've still read this as best practice before).
 Any guidance on this one appreciated. Thank you!
 [EDIT]: I'm also (now) fairly certain my config was wrong as rate shape doesn't do anything without QoS queues defined, but I'm still curious about the best practice aspect. I believe this is how I'd do it on Arista (?): Rate Limit on Arista switch

 Beginning December 20, 2022, Rapid7 has responded to an increase in the number of Microsoft Exchange server compromises. The attacks appear to chain CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 together to bypass previously recommended URL rewrite mitigations that Microsoft provided for ProxyNotShell. Threat actors are using this to deploy ransomware. 
 Rapid7 recommends that organizations who have yet to install the Exchange update (KB5019758) from November 2022 should do so immediately and investigate systems for indicators of compromise. Do not rely on the rewrite mitigations for protection. 
 Customers already have coverage to assist in assessing exposure to and detecting exploitation of this threat: 
 ​
  
InsightVM and Nexpose: InsightVM and Nexpose added checks for CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 on November 8, 2022.
 InsightIDR: InsightIDR customers can look for the alerting of 8 rules listed in our blog post.

 A worker for a state agency seeking child support from someone who MIGHT work/have worked for us was reaching out. Legitimate email. Now, did they send this to HR? Some high profile person in the company? No. Somehow they managed to figure out three of our internal distribution lists (likely more, but only those three accept email from outside the domain) and sent a blast out to all of them.
 This is already in "Oh hell no" territory. But it was worse. There was an attachment as well as the person's name. And the attachment, an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT, had the Name, Address, Family Members, and SSN of said person they were looking for. Sent to a distribution list with hundreds of recipients.
 HR notified, and well... I'd been putting off on learning how to mass delete things via Exchange powershell. Email is gone except for what's been saved as evidence, but that information was still accessible for several hours. To hundreds of people.
 In HR's hands now, and I really hope that state worker gets more than a slap on the wrist.
 Bless all of you who put tutorials online.

 I have something like this across 2 data centres (green is Site A, yellow is Site B): https://i.imgur.com/nKKrVnN.png . The 2x2 ToR switches are OS10, and I'm new to them. 
 Each site has its own edge so internet bound traffic is always directed from the 2 switches to their respective local firewall as their default g/w. 
 Is it then possible to configure the ToR switches to monitor an internet IP and if it is down, change their default gateway? 
 Take for instance the green side. I want 172.30.0.11 and 172.30.0.12 to monitor an internet ip (say 8.8.8.8), and if its unreachable, change its default gw to 172.30.0.4 ? 
 Thanks for any tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had basically no spam filtering when I inherited my new role managing a company and their email was just a firestorm of spam and garbage.
 I enrolled the domain in a new spam filtering service (Antespam) which I've used many times in the past and love it and it offers users the ability to whitelist/manage their own spam and have great customer support.
 Not 3 days in and I'm already getting all kinds of push back from people whining that they don't want to have to babysit their email.
 I've tried telling them that checking the sidelined emails every day or at the beginning and end of each day here initially will give them the chance to add senders to their whitelist and as a result, legitimate emails getting sidelined will occur less frequently.
 "Thanks, I hate it."
 I implemented the filtering on Friday night and it's blocked 9 viruses, one spear phishing attempt and 91% of inbound mail was spam.
 The users heavily impacted by spam in the past are singing praises from the mountaintops (some would get anywhere from 50 to 100 spam mails per day) but those who got relatively no spam are up in arms that they didn't need it, want to opt out (you can't) and are seemingly trying to convince management that we don't need this.
 The CEO is on my side, agrees that it's best for our network safety and approved the move to the service. I am just trying to craft that diplomatic message to the nay sayers who maybe weren't really affected by spam before but now are having legit emails get put on the sideline and causing them to have to routinely go and check for mail sitting in the filter.

I feel it really does not matter all that much but I was just checking what people typically do here.

Our first post in r/sysadmin received a ton of awesome feedback and suggestions two years ago on how to improve the platform and we’ve worked hard to build every feature that was requested. We’re back to give some insight into our journey since our last post and answer any questions or hear suggestions you may have. There's a lot below, but we wrote this with the hope that the sysadmin community would find it interesting to hear the story of a small SaaS startup(?), how we approach enginering, and how we appreciate and act on feed back from the community -- you all.

 But when I'm trying to use winget, nothing works. I use it in the system environment, at startup, with - -accept-package-agreements and - -accept-source-agreemets options.
 Obviously I've tried running the command by itself and it does work.
 I've tried to get the output of winget - -info to a file and it does not work either.
 Do you guts have any experience with that?

 I have one pair that's linked between two routers, i've put an tap/splitter into the the lines, but i need to receive this signal. When hooking it up to the rx port of another CWDM4 transceiver all i get is a sad day :(
 ​
 Edit: Just to clarify i have the tx from each of the transceivers tapped, and im trying to input this into the rx of another cwdm4 to see what i am receiving. The problem is that i'm not getting anything from the transceiver even though i have great signal strength.

 Any tips for me?
 Eternal gratitude will be given to those who can help me.

 so i am new to this field and landed few months ago this "helpdesk" role but i am kinda a jack of all trades.
 I need to take on some security tasks, one of them is to split all the admin accounts to 2 accounts, 1 account to do admin stuff and 1 "normal" user account. (so for example, the IT personel now only uses 1 account for everything like normal desktop and mail work and also admin work). we want to split these into 2.
 I thought the best way to do this is to take a copy of the existing admin accounts and demote the existing admin account to an user account and the copy is the new admin account to do admin stuff. 
 Does any of you guys has experience with this? i am a bit stressed to operate this project. Any help is welcome.
 We are on a hybrid Microsoft environment.

 Let's say my domain is domain.local and my domain controllers are DC-OLD and DC-NEW. I have promoted DC-NEW to be a Domain Controller and Demoted DC-OLD. When I look in my DNS I find:
 1) zone _msdcs.domain.local, this zone contains all records I expect, SRV records / _gc records / _ldap records etc.
 2) zone domain.local, this zone contains all servers / computers / etc.
 3) subzone, _msdcs under number 2. This is a DNS Delegate if I am right (grey icon). In this subzone I only find a NS record pointing to DC-OLD
 The NS record under 3 is not updated by the DC promotion and demotion (number 1 is updated correctly). Feels like it is not actively used in my situation, if I do a lookup to _msdcs.domain.local it will answer with information found in number 1. I think this is some sort of pointer solution used in ealier versions of Windows AD.
 What is the right thing to do? I can think of 2 scenario's:
 a) Replace the NS record of DC-OLD with DC-NEW
 b) Do not give it any attention, let it just like this
 I think scenario a is the best option. Is this correct and does it have any impact on my AD / DNS if I take this action?

 I have configured an M2 based Macbook for a remote user, and part of that is installing the DUO client. Whilst setting it up, everything worked well and Duo sent a push notification to approve the login.
 Now the user has it, the laptop is obviously not configured for their home wifi, so Duo complains that it can't do anything as it has no network connection. Putting the user in bypass mode makes no difference, as the client still can't connect to the Duo servers...
 Apple in their infinite wisdom doesn't allow you to connect to a wifi network from the login screen. Using the Option key to boot up and connect to a wifi network doesn't pass the connection through to the login screen either.
 I have sent the user a USB-C to LAN adapter which said it was plug and play on Macs, and although it works on their personal Dell laptop, it doesn't work on their company issued Mac. I don't know if this is because it doesn't work on M2 devices, or if the Mac needs to silently install something when it's connected, but because the laptop isn't logged in, it's not able to.
 I've ordered another adapter for the user which claims compatibility with M2 Macs, so I'm crossing fingers for that.
 The user is 2 1/2 hours drive away, so a visit is not really practical.
 Does anyone have any ideas on how I can best get this user up and running?

 ​
 Also , We don't have any hostname for remote environment. Just We have VLAN Address informations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: People are missing non-junk emails because they end up in the junk folder. Especially if they are auto-forwards from another domain.
 Ideally, we want nothing to go into the junk folder (unless on the block senders list). So everything goes to the inbox, notwithstanding malware and phishing. With everything going to Inbox, it would also be nice to get some indicator of junkiness as a MailTip on the message, but we'd settle for pre-pending the subject.
 Have a ticket open with Microsoft, and here's what we tried:
  
Change the anti-spam policy. Any actions that say 'send to junk folder' have been changed to prepend the subject with 'Possible spam'.
  
This doesn't really work. Yes, the subject is changed. But the email still ends up in the Junk folder. Maybe Outlook is doing this by examining the SCL. But there's also no way to turn off the junk filter in Outlook. Just in case, I checked the blocked domains/emails list, and it is empty.
  
Set up a transport rule to change all inbound mail to SCL -1. 
  
This works, but I don't like it because a) it doesn't prepend the subject, and b) it alters the SCL artificially, so by the time you get the message, you don't know what the original SCL was.
  
Adjust the rule to prepend a subject. Ended up pre-pending everything. So we adjusted the rule to only apply to inbound mail where the SCL was above 4. But then the rule seemed never to get applied.
  
Advice? (other than use a 3rd party product)

 Do you guys have a tool, more like a database which is good for note storing? Something where you can reference a ticket number or project name and link all the notes you took relating to it.

 I'm just looking at the Cisco build tool and as usual I'm confused by it. 
 I know you have to order the DNA licensing but don't have to renew it but what I can't see is if you don't renew are you then on a reduced bandwidth? 
 I need the C8500-8S4X to have 10Gb available throughput and looking at the license options it has the below: 
 DNA-P-T3-A-3Y = Cisco DNA Advantage On-Prem Lic 3Y - upto 10G (Aggr, 20G) 
 If I get this and it expires after 3 years will it then reduce the router down to it's base throughput whatever that may be? 
 Or am I looking at this wrong and the C8500 series isn't license locked anyway?

 Recently, our organization updated from ActivClient 7.1.x.x to 7.4.1.5 and started seeing some inconsistent results with our smart card functionality. Previously, we didn't really have any issues, except some few instances we we began rolling out O365 (that requires PIV auth) over the summer. In our VDI infrastructure, we had more issues with O365 and were told to update our ActivClient by our parent org. We ran into a host of more issues, but now that we updated a small batch of physical workstations and see some similar behavior, it is helping us zero in on the ActivClient 7.4.1.5 version specifically.
 What we're seeing: mostly smart card failing to read the certificate, but error messages vary. For my own…]]></summary>

 I know this sounds unbelievable but whenever I try to run a non-powershell command in PowerShell in a GNU screen session, the terminal is getting stuck.
 I am able to reproduce this on my Ubuntu 20.04 server:
  
Open up a screen session by invoking screen
 Run a non-powershell command in PowerShell: pwsh -c "id -u"
  
This error occurs both when starting a screen session on my host, connect to my server via ssh and run pwsh -c "id -u" and when first connecting to my server, starting a screen session on my server and running pwsh -c "id -u".
 My current workaround is to instead run pwsh -c "{ commands }" | cat.
 Running pwsh -c "id -u" in a screen session on my host (i.e. without ever connecting to my server via ssh) works.
 Does this sound familiar to you? I'm very confused - it doesn't make any sense to me.

 We have an small on-prem AD with 10 servers and 35-40 clients. Users are warehouse users working at packing stations on kiosks and the servers are controlling warehouse stuff + microsoft infra servers. 
 Now the wsus have stopped working. 
 ​
 Thinking with only 35-40 clients (servers are managed by Azure Update Automation which is not supported for Windows 10), wouldn't it be easier with updating against WU directly? 
 Bandwidth is not a problem. But we want maybe be able to do half of the workstations at the time if we get an bad update. 
 Whats your take?

 I have hardware toke,password and authenticator for the account. I can sign in using one of the two(for admin)but it shows Verify your identity. My understanding is that additional verification is set to have 2 methods, verify using email and authenticator. 
 I was testing out authentication strength and enabled the highest one with hardware token or windows hello or business or Certificate for admins. I do have authenticator and if the prompt shows up(when I sign in to non admin stuff) it gets stuck on verify your identity because authentication strength for users was also enabled to passwordless. I do have that but I am not excluded from the policies. 
 I have already contacted Microsoft and they have arranged a call back but I was wondering if there is any solution. No glass break account available. If I click cancel, it shows account as signed in but. It goes to verify your identity when I click on it.

 I think MI Support is playing me here.
 We are currently running Core 11.5 and we usually use a policy to restrict iOS devices not up to date to connect to our Infra.
 Our current config is set to quarantine anything before iOS 16.1. With the arrival of 16.2 we wanted to update said config to 16.2 but it is not listed there.
 ​
 Mobile iRon is not telling me to update Core because only EPMM 11.8 will support iOS 16.2.
 They are sending me a bunch of kbase about Compatibility and according to said kBase even Core 11.7 would be not compatible with anything above iOS 15.5.
 ​
 Am i the only one having such problem with Ivanti/Mobile iRon ? 
 ​
 ( We could upgrade, but given the poor support, i'm not sure this would fix it. 
 We are on freeze due to year end, so that would anyway require a thousand approvals from the business.
 yes i have done the Device and Platform update manually ).

 We have a few thousand of these in use. On the latest firmware (*08). Power Saving turned off. Dell laptops. Dell keyboards and mice. Dell everything. Some of the issues our user's get:
  
Loud screeching noise from the speakers begins randomly while user's are in Teams meetings. Monitor has to be power cycled to shut it up.
 
Various devices inside the dock will randomly not be passed to Windows (eg: ethernet, 2nd display (daisy chained)). Sometimes both displays show nothing but peripherals like keyboard and mouse work. Unplugging the USB-C cable and plugging in 3 to 20 times seems to resolve it until next time.
 
Slow detection/starting up of monitor/dock once USB-C cable is connected. Users say they "often" see it take a minute for the screens to display anything.
 
Arcing / crackling sound when the monitor is in standby and no laptop is connected. Power cycling stops the noise temporarily.
 
Microphone quality / audio issues during Teams meetings. I'm aware of the "double noise cancellation" issue that occurs when Teams is trying to reduce background noise and the monitor's microphone is trying to do the same, but come on, these are supposedly "Teams certified" devices. How is this conflict expected behaviour?

 Switched from 2010x86 to 2016x64, clean install. Additionaly installed SAP and Oracle SmartView and updates. We were also trying to open a file without sap and sv, no change.
 That accounting department won't pay us for that switch lol. The funny thing is that this issue is only on new laptops company bought. Both new laptop and old pc has same os, same updates and same software with add-Ins, but laptop won't open docs that pc can.
 Reinstalling windows would be a nice idea tho. Still, this case has 33% chance after reinstalling windows.

 We have a new 1GB DIA circuit from Zayo in the datacenter we're colocating in. The datacenter tech ran a SMF jumper from the Zayo handoff to our cabinet where for the time being I have it going to a 1.25GB SPF module in an EdgeRouter X SFP.
 That's it. Simple and sweet, but I'm only getting aprx 150-180Mb down, 300-400Mb up speeds. That's testing from every major speed test website, as well as running Iperf to the public 10Gb servers. Also tried testing directly from the router itself using Ubiquiti's speed test built in UISP. Same every time.
 I tried both setting the router up as a L3 gateway, and as a L2 switch. Same results.
 Naturally Zayo refuses to even consider the problem may be on their end.
 Any suggestions?

It's about 25 miles away but the traffic is so horrible my average daily commute is 1hr10min each way. That's 40hr+ a month sitting in traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At one of our branch sites, for the past few days, users have been complaining about network connectivity being lost or crawling while attempting to access certain websites. During the time they say the issues are happening, no maintenance, or backups are occurring. Something tells me to check the routes on the customer edge router at the site and I see that all of iBGP learned routes are recently learned. Flapping has crossed my mind so I check the logs, and around the same time users “lose”connectivity to the sites, one can see BFD adjacencies going down between the CE spoke and a WAN reflector we have in another location. 
 Interestingly enough, the websites users are attempting to access are not suppose to be learned via iBGP. They are externally redistributed in EIGRP. During the issue, when checking the time of the EIGRP routes, they are days old. So how could users not have access to the sites? When you run a trace to the website during the issue, it makes it there. When you check the ISP vrf, the route to the PE is still there. No circuit issues are seen. 
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am looking into start of authority and am curious about something.
 We have 5 Domain Controllers, 2 of which are having replication issues. DC1 is one with replication issues and also so happens to be the SOA for all DNS zones on all of the DCs.
 DC2 is a direct mirror of DC1, with the exception of ADFS, and so I thought "what if we made DC2 SOA for all the DNS zones across all DCs"
 If this change were to be made, what potential issues would you expect I run into?
 The reason this thought exists is due to replication being down on 2 DCs, we want to demote and repromote without DNS giving us an error, especially since we already tried this and we found out that it was due to SOA.
 Any insight into this or helpful suggestions, would be appreciated.
 **additional info*\*
 there is a bit of background missing here, most of which I do not have since I have only been in this position for 5 months.
 From what I can put together from various conversations the prior sys admins made undocumented changes to the DCs, which ive been working to understand,. its slow going.
 The issue we have is 4 of the 5 DCs have the same DNS forward/reverse zones and the 5th is minus a few the other 4 have.
 The replication issue came on roughly 2 months ago and only hit DC1 and DC5 with an error that states "sysvol inaccessible"
 We tried to demote DC1 and repromote it, but when we did we got an error stating the DNS server was not present even though the role existed. 
 One of our contractors helped look into this and determined it could possibly be a start of authority issue.
 I have never had to actually do this before in all my time in IT, so this is very much uncharted waters for me.

 Thank you

My management said it’s all pre-recorded and that all I have to do is “flip the switch” on Christmas eve morning… I have located those pre-recordings but I’m lost in the sauce on how to apply them.

 I have a question in regard to setting up some filters on Juniper EX switches and I hope you can help me out with a sanity check and ideas on how to make my configuration better. Or if I am on the wrong path - set me towards the correct one.
 For the sake of this question, let's assume the following very simple topology:
 ​
 Juniper MX Edge ----> Juniper QFX Core ---> Juniper EX top-of-rack ---> Host1, Host2, Host3, HostX
 ​
 Each VLAN is up on the QFX Core and the EX TOR switches act as simple Layer2 devices only. Ideally, we want to keep this configuration like that and not bring VLANs up on the EX switches - only ACLs.
 ​
 Currently, each of the hosts connected to the TOR switches (in our case - dedicated server services) are in their own VLAN with a /30 of IPv4…]]></summary>

 I have an HCI cluster connected to two disparate switches. The NICs on the cluster are set to active-backup, so if the active fails for whatever reason it is supposed to switch to the backup.
 The two switches are directly connected via LAG/Trunk (LACP). The two switches are also connected to the core for user traffic.
 I'm trying to avoid potential issues with spanning-tree topology changes causing all of the ports to go into listening mode for 30 seconds, and crashing the whole cluster. I have implemented portfast/admin-edge on all ports connecting to the HCI, but I also want to enable it on the Trunk/LAG.
 I've been taught to never implement portfast on uplinks to other switches, so I'm afraid to pull the trigger on that last part. But I would think that the core uplink from the secondary would always be in a blocking state unless the primary core uplink goes down. Does that sound right? 
 Thanks!

 Recently I was connecting 2 floors together with the exact same Cisco 9300s, running near the same SW Ver (One is running 17.03.04 the other 17.03.05). While connecting these two with SFP+, I put in the EXACT same SFP+ modules, and I couldn't get a connection, even though the switches saw them both. Both SFP+ were brand new. After much troubleshooting, I swapped one out with a different one, and viola, I got connection. Now here are the two SFP+ modules, and tell me how this is working, and why the exact two didn't. (I'm new to working with fiber, so please bear with me) 
 Floor 3: SFP-10G-BX ; 1330nm ; LC Connection
 Floor 2: SFP-10G-BX80 ; 1270nm ; LC Connection 
 I thought the wavelengths HAD to be the same on both ends? What's the deal? Also, this is a single wire, yellow cable, (SFP's are single too) which I believe to be single mode. Any insight would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience here before I jump down this rabbit hole.
 I'm in a ~80 user environment that has on-prem AD (probably not going away) that's using ADConnect to sync users to the cloud and O365/Exchange Online (for many years). Exchange has never been installed in this environment, so there are no Exchange attributes in AD.
 I have a few items I'd like to tackle (mostly cleaning up the GAL (hiding on prem DLs, hiding certain users), ability to add additional addresses to users) that seem they would be easier if I had the Exchange Attributes in AD. My understanding is I can just run 
 XX:\Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /PrepareSchema 
 and that will give me the attributes I need, not install Exchange and I can do basic management from ADSI. I know I'll need to refresh the schema in ADConnect, and I know that for "msExchHideFromAddressLists" to populate, "mailNickname" needs to be populated an unique.
 Here are a few questions I've come up with
  
Will this overwrite anything in the cloud and 'break' existing mailboxes (stuff like legacyExchangeDN or X500 addresses)
 Should I continue with the installation of Exchange server for management purposes? If I go this route, do I need to set up Hybrid Mode? Or is 'just installing' Exchange enough?
 Am I muddling my environment by adding Exchange? Should I instead take alternate routes to accomplish these goals? (like use msDS-CloudExtensionAttribute custom sync rules) For what it's worth, if I installed Exchange, my plan would be to have it on a server that's only booted when doing management tasks, but otherwise not powered on.
  
I'm wondering if anyone else has gone down this path before, and curious what you've seen... most of my worry is in overwriting something that was custom set on the cloud for a sync'd user, though I know most parameters must be sync'd from on-prem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 ​
 I am trying to write a batch file that goes through a text file and for each line of the text file runs psexec net user command.
 ​
 So far I have the following
 ​
 @echo off setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion :: Reset file Type Nul >"C:\outputfile.txt" for /F "delims=" %%a in (C:\ip_addresses) do ( set Var1=\\%%a psexec.exe VAR1 net user COMMANDS_HERE >NUL 2>&1 If !errorlevel! equ 0 ( echo %%a Account-Created echo %%a Account-Created>>"C:\create-account.txt" ) Else ( echo %%a Account-NOT-Created echo %%a Account-NOT-Created>>"C:\create-account.txt" ) ) pause 
 ​
 I am definitely getting the second part of the else statement because I can't figure out a way to add the "\\" to the %%a placeholder so that psexec executes on the target machine.
 ​
 I know the command I am running with psexec works without an issue as I have tested individually.
 ​
 I have to use this process or manually go and touch about 50+ machines ;-)
 ​
 I appreciate any input.
 ​
 Edit:
 Fixed formatting so my code was in code block format.
 ​
 Edit2:
 Powershell remote administration is not an option...I know, I would much rather use the fantastic tools supplied with Powershell.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to troubleshoot an issue with a org user not receiving notification emails from our support system. In Mimecast the email bounces with an NDR 5.4.1 Recipient address rejected. At first I thought it was a problem with Mimecast but it seems this is the bounce you get when DBEB is rejecting the email. Now I didn't know much about it too be honest until the last few weeks. Microsoft support is useless. They just constantly refer me too their support page explaining DBEB. This user is replicated correctly within O365 from what I see, and our accepted domains are all set to authoritative. Besides that, I am convinced this support system sending these emails (amazonses) has the user on the account level suppression list due to the bounces, but I don't have access to this account to verify. Either way DBEB is the first barrier I need to make sure is not rejecting emails to valid addresses. Anyone have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cisco is proposing a Nexus 9k environment backed by Nexus Dashboard to upgrade our horribly EOL 6509s. We originally were going to 7706s and then they EOLd those as well. My original plan to use VDCs on the 7706s appears to be dead.
 I'm pretty unfamiliar with ACI/Dashboard, but they're pushing this because I wanted to use VDCs, and they're saying I can do the same thing but with 'slices'. 
 Additionally I can see us using VXLANs as well.
 WTF am I getting myself into? Managing Nexus at the cli is no problem for me, but selling my soul to a dashboard (one from Cisco at that) is something I'm wary about.
 Should I bail?
 Thanks.

 I'm looking for the smallest footprint network monitoring and alerting software available. I need to install it in *NIX. All I need is icmp/TCP checks on around 20 remote devices, and then email alerts if those aren't responding after a certain amount of time.
 I don't need a web interface, or graphing, or historical data. I'd even prefer to avoid installing mysql or any DB if possible.
 Does anything like this exist? I've used LibreNMS/Zabbix/icinga2/etc in the past and they are fantastic, but they are overkill for the needs I have on my current project.
 Maybe my best option is to throw together a crude bash script?
 Thanks in advance for any ideas you can send my way!

 However, I got mixed information regarding these shared mailboxes also needing an exchange license (I don't need any of the exchange features coming with the license).
 So my question is:
 Do I need an exchange online license and MDO licenses for each shared mailbox? Or is a MDO license enough?
 In case I need an exchange license, what happens if I run it without one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that we've rebuilt from the Rackspace disaster I have one more thing to figure out. Our spam filtering on Edgewave/GoSecure. Problem is it doesn't seem to work with M365. I've gone in one of our domains and changed the MX, then went into the verifiers and added one for M365 and authorized it with Microsoft but it won't test and it won't discover mailboxes. Tech support says to use the M365 verifier and RCPTTO for discovery but it doesn't work. And the error I'm getting on every single page of the website is a generic "an error occurred. If this continues contact the administrator" not anything like "failed to discover mailboxes" or "verification failed". It's like a web page error.
 Support has been no help at all. They keep saying the same thing about using the verifier and RCPTTO and that there's an issue with the testing. When I explain I've done that they ask another dumb question like "are the mailboxes not being created?" And then don't respond again. I've had pretty good luck with them up until now but I'm seeing the Rackspace fiasco all over again.
 Anyone have this working?

 Just checking the logon events in the security event log journal on one of my DC and i'm wondering if this is the expected behaviour that i have this:
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.
 Account Information:
 Account Name: my domain administrator account (administrator@mydomain.whatever) Account Domain: my domain Logon GUID: xxxxxxx 
 Service Information:
 Service Name: a workstation from the domain$ Service ID: domain\\workstation$ 
 ​
 Network Information:
 Client Address: ::1 Client Port: 0 
 ​
 Additional Information:
 Ticket Options: 0x810000 Ticket Encryption Type: 0x12 Failure Code: 0x0 Transited Services: - 
 This event is generated every time access is requested to a resource such as a computer or a Windows service. The service name indicates the resource to which access was requested.
 This event can be correlated with Windows logon events by comparing the Logon GUID fields in each event. The logon event occurs on the machine that was accessed, which is often a different machine than the domain controller which issued the service ticket.
 Ticket options, encryption types, and failure codes are defined in RFC 4120.
 ​
 ​
 Do you guys think it's normal to see my administrator account requesting kerberos ticket?

Full report:
  
This situation has all the hallmarks of business management strong-arming the IT organization into an unrealistic timeline. When business leaders push for overly-aggressive timelines, or regulators ask for multiple competing risk frameworks and excessive after-the-fact incident reporting, this all puts a strain on the delivery organization’s ability to untangle the complexity before ‘go live’.

 After 10 years, in march of next year our root vpn cert will expire. I was tasked with renewing the cert(s).
 We have a large volume of connected devices that sometimes can have a downtime of few weeks, so i need to think and implement a solution fast so it can propagate.
 The devices have various hardware and software configurations, from different time periods, so i want to make as minimal changes as possible (e.g. avoid redirecting to a different openvpn instance).
 My google-fu gave me one method - stacked certificates - also explained by hexonet on their blog: https://www.hexonet.net/blog/migrating-new-ca-for-openvpn , it seems that i could simply regenerate the client certs based on the new ca cert and swap them one by one without killing "old" access for not-yet patched cients.
 How would you approach it? There are milions of users so i would prefer to not introduce any significant downtime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm writing this post to get some advice regarding a problem that is affecting the network of the company I work for.
 Our infrastructure consists of L2 devices (switches, radios etc) within it and is "delimited" by many L3 routers which are the edges of our unic large broadcast domain. Obviously there are several VLANs within it, but we have to propagate them over the backbone links, preventing us from segmenting the network.
 The problem is the following: every time we put a new PC on the network, it starts a NetBIOS boradcast storm that propagates to all our switches, causing us many problems. We have intercepted the packet with WireShark and we are certain that this is the problem, what we don't understand is why the packet continues to run even after disconnecting the offending PC. We have already taken steps to put in the broacast limits (storm constrain etc) but we would prefer to solve the problem at the source.
 Has anyone ever had a similar problem? Is there any way to prevent the storm, apart from disabling NetBIOS? Could this be due to a malware installed on one of our networked devices?
 Thanks to all those who will respond!

 Now what i would like to get is the connected server name, Local pc name, logged in user, windows build version of the client pc, and which groups/roles are added to the pc and logged in user.
 My current vbs script is visible here: https://pastebin.com/raw/iqnXY3VF
 I already searched on google but most of the things i could find are for local pc's.
 thanks everyone in advance
 edit: I am aware that this might belong in the techsupport reddit but i think the changes to solve this are higher in the sysadmin community

 I have a problematic that I'm not sure how to solve easily :
 Previously, we had some Office 16 licences and we used them on some PCs from our fleet. But they weren't many and we widely used LibreOffice instead. So when we wanted to install Office on a certain PC, we used a .exe and did a manual install.
 Today, we decided to switch to Office 2019 for all of our users, and with that comes a problem.
 I have to create a GPO which checks if Office 2016 is installed on a computer. If so, it should uninstall it and then install Office 2019 with our key.
 But I also have to make sure the PCs with Office 2007 are excluded from that GPO, since we still use that with some applications that require 2007 specifically.
 Do you think I can do that with only one Powershell script for example ?

 We have them in several locations and I've recently taken the role as primary maintainer. What I've found is that they seem to be very buggy. They come with a process that will initiate a reboot when internet connectivity is lost but once in a while, they don't fully recover from the reboot. power cycling to reboot again doesn't work. 
 We also see an issue where the admin interface ssh daemon fails and you can't log in that way. webui still works. 
 Their support is... lacking to say the least.
 Their firmware path is questionable. 
 Multiple power cycling doesn't appear to help, only consoling in and rebooting that way allows it to properly shut down and restart.
 So it almost seems like our out of band management system needs an out of band management system.
 Anyone else have experience with Perle and maybe some hints?

 We're running through Cyber Essentials, and one of the passing criteria is to block models that no longer receive security updates from the manufacturer (eg Pixel 3a with Android 10) from accessing cloud resources (authenticating via Azure AD).
 How are people managing similar scenarios, it seems a bit over kill to force users to enforce users to use Edge and enroll into Intune to manage this.
 My thoughts turn to Conditional Access Policy, where for iPhone I could block by iOS version, but that's only shows a major version, ie iOS 16, not iOS 16.2. Android is even worse where it seems to just display Android
 Have others had to achieve the above and if so how are they tackling this? Is the only way by enrollment? I'm using a Microsoft 365 E5 license if that helps suggest options.

 I’ve been working as a sysadmin (linux, networking) and then a dev ops engineer (cloud stuff, some python for building tools and automation) for close to 10 years now. Started doing entry level stuff and then “senior” now according to my job title.
 However, one thing that has stayed consistent is that I’m always expected to do on-calls.
 Over the years, on-call has taken its toll on me. I lose weekends that could have been spent on hobbies, or with friends. I have chronic insomnia due to all irregular work hours and late night calls. In short, I constantly feel tired, lonely and mildly depressed.
 Asides from that, I enjoy the job and tinkering with the tech. I don’t think I am ready to leave this industry and do something completely different (like woodworking or something).
 From where I am, what are the possible jobs that I can transition into that doesn’t require on-calls?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I was watching a video on switches that stated a switch can store MAC Addresses in it's CAM table after there has been an attempt to communicate from A to B and then a reply from B to A. That would store the MAC addresses of both A and B, but if this is the first time either of these are communicating on the switch I assume it would have to broadcast the entire message from A to B to all ports (similar to a hub) and listen for where the reply comes to map B to it's proper port. If that is true could that be a security risk? 
 My other thought is that it would just be one frame (since after first frame it would all be routed directly A to B) so it might not be a huge deal. All of this for the main question of is it possible to have the switch send essentially a "discovery" frame to every port and map the replies so that it wouldn't have to send an initial message to all ports. 
 I also think I may be overthinking a relatively miniscule detail but it just caught my attention and was curious. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read and reply!

Currently, they use Jenkins on like 9 different desktop computers. Obviously I want to simplify this and get a server and virtualize this and use containers. Everything else we have is in the cloud (SCM, E-mails, File storage). Or should we just do hosted services online? Does making a build use GPU?

 Long story short
  
There is an MBAM server (reporting doesn't work tho)
 There is a GPO with Bitlocker settings
 Wanted to move Bitlocker to SCCM 
 Log said on clients that policy did not apply, as the workload for Endpoint Protection was switched ot Pilot Intune (crap)
 Looked at MDM... literally nothing set - just enable bitlocker drive encription
 
  
At this stage keys still get to AD, but it seems that most of the GPO settings won't really apply (e.g. 256 bit cipher is set there, but checking on the client with manage-bde the cipher is 128 bit.
 I think literally the MDM setting takes over and it soley turns on bitlocker, but doesn't really configure it to our needs.
 I'd happily move the slider over back to ConfigMgr, but Endpoint Protection has a lot of other stuff, defender firewall and what not...
 The pilot collection is however a huge one. With 95%+ of our clients... bummer.
 I am crying... any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ars
  
Researchers recently discovered a Windows code-execution vulnerability that has the potential to rival EternalBlue, the name of a different Windows security flaw used to detonate WannaCry, the ransomware that shut down computer networks across the world in 2017.
 Like EternalBlue, CVE-2022-37958, as the latest vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to execute malicious code with no authentication required. Also, like EternalBlue, it’s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required.
 But unlike EternalBlue, which could be exploited when using only the SMB, or server message block, a protocol for file and printer sharing and similar network activities, this latest vulnerability is present in a much broader range of network protocols, giving attackers more flexibility than they had when exploiting the older vulnerability.
  
Good news:
  
One potentially mitigating factor is that a patch for CVE-2022-37958 has been available for three months. EternalBlue, by contrast, was initially exploited by the NSA as a zero-day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Context:
 I hack companies legally through called bug bounties. A few months ago, a Fortune 500 company gave me the opportunity to run phishing campaigns on their employees at a bug bounty event. 
 For some reason, they believed they were "unphishable" and offered a bounty for each employee I was able to phish. They were using Okta & Duo for MFA. 
 So, I bought a domain similar to theirs. I used Gophish & Mailgun to send an email, and Evilnginx to bypass MFA. I abused an XSS in one of their subdomains to redirect to a phishing page. Got 50+ pairs of credentials & Okta sessions, and full access to their AWS console within 2 minutes. I was blown away and terrified by how simple it was to compromise them. 
 Questions:
 I'm looking at how people are defending against phishing.
 From what I hear, Proofpoint and Mimecast don't stop most phishing emails. Security education can only be done so often and techniques are evolving.
 Vendor email compromise makes it even more difficult to prevent. 
 I know many people also run phishing simulations, but a recent study found "that embedded training during simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead, it can have unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to phishing"
 You obviously can't expect everyone to be a tech expert and you can't expect email gateways to catch all phishing emails. If phishing simulations can have unexpected side effects, then what? Is trying to prevent phishing a hopeless pursuit?
 So, I'm curious:
  
How are you currently tackling phishing (including vendor email compromise)? 
 What providers do you use? (abnormalsecurity.com, inky.com, breachless.ai)?
 
 How often are you requiring security awareness training? With who & why them?
 How do you detect compromise? What do you do next?
  
Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I hope this is the right place to ask.
 I am developing what has turned into a small mmo. Every tick of the server sends an update packet for the actors to each connected client. There are other times a server will queue packets for other events to download partial compressed contents (zip) for the next area if the player does not have it. 
 The network code is very simple. We use UDP and have our own packet processor that handles queuing, waiting, sorting, chunking packets for various data-types types. 
 Lately more players are reporting a lag. The servers are taking longer to reply, some cannot start isolated P2P combat sessions when they could before, and so on. I have no expertise in this area except for the protocols I've read about and network architecture to for games. 
 Is it possible that ISP's are throttling unrecognized packet types? Since our packet structure is in-house, and each one varies, my hunch is the ISP is scrutinizing and scanning this traffic because it looks suspicious. I wonder if we wrap our packets in a well-known protocol like WebRTC for instance, if we'd get faster response times. 
 The code itself isn't the culprit because the players reporting the issues are using the latest client which has not changed in a year now. If it's possible the packets are being throttled, my next step will address that. But if it's not likely, then I will need to consider other factor causing online stability issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question regarding single homed devices on a n9k vPC setup.
 Take for example a security server connected on the vPC primary n9k-1 on eth1/1. It has a single nic
 that terminates on a security VLAN on just that one switch. 
 If I leave all VLAN's trunked across the peer link then eth1/1 gets flagged as an orphan port. If I prune the security VLAN from the peer link then that flag is removed. 
 My question is...is there any downside to just leaving the VLAN on the peer link and having an orphan port? If the peer link goes down nothing would happen to an orphan port or non-orphan port by default and we want this port to stay up if the peer-link fails. If the entire switch fails then we would have to physically move the uplink to eth1/1 on the secondary so that traffic would leave out that path.
 Correct me if I am wrong, but I feel like the orphan port concept is more geared toward active/passive devices where you want to explicitly shut a port on a switch that has shut its vPC ports to prevent black holing of traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 My company has asked me to "Load balance the SSLVPN".
 Basically, we have two locations, Main and our Disaster Recovery location. Both of these locations run SonicWall setups with HA and Dual WAN failover. Both have SSLVPN enabled. We use Local + LDAP Auth & TOTP currently. We use Azure AD Connect to sync on prem AD to Azure. 
 The idea is this -
 If our Main site's SonicWall were to go down, the boss would like for users to be able to seamlessly connect to the disaster recovery site without needing to change binding/URLs.
 How it works now -
 If the Main SonicWall were to go down, users can type in the URL to the secondary (DR Site) SonicWall's VPN Office Portal. From here they can bind their TOTP, then log into NetExtender, change the "server" on Net Extender to the DR site's URL, and log in with their credentials using the DR sites 2FA token.
 How they want it to work - 
 Main SonicWall goes down, users go to the same URL and can use the same 2FA token to login. Users would not have to change the "Server" on Net Extender. 
 I'm planning on setting up Radius regardless, and I'm looking into alternatives like Azure AD 2FA with NPS, though I'm having a hard time finding articles/research to help me achieve what I need to accomplish here. Anyone able to offer suggestions/ link articles that could nudge me in the right direction? My experiencing with load balancing is not the best I'll admit.

We are looking to do an entire network refresh of our switches and access points in all of our plants, offices, and data center. Right now we have a hodge podge of manufacturers from all of our past acquisitions and we are finally moving forward with standardizing our network. We have met with a few vendors and done demos are looking to make our final decision on who to proceed with. 
 We're currently contemplating Cisco, Meraki, Fortinet, and Aruba. I'm attempting to make a list of items to evaluate and grade for each possible option and would love some of your feedback and ideas on what are some of your key features and criteria you'd look at when evaluating a new platform. Whoever we go with we will also purchase their NAC and that is a large consideration as well. Fortunately price isn't much of a deciding factor as we have excellent backing from upper leadership to move forward with this.
 Thank you all very much for any advice and input you have.
 tl;dr: What criteria should I consider when evaluating switch and AP vendors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The choice is mine ultimately but I want to see what the fine people on Reddit thought and whether anyone has made a similar choice.
 I spent a long time getting good networking roles based on experience and demonstrable knowledge but now I really want to get some certs under my belt.
 Recently passed the JNCIS-ENT and loved that, was a good challenge (especially for someone so unused to exams).
 But now I'm thinking, well what next? My company I work for deploys a reasonable mix of Cisco and Juniper (mainly Cisco) - so I'm trying to decide whether to go for JNCIP straight away, get a few extra JNCIA certs (Sec/Dev) OR.... start on Cisco and get the CCNA. Or something else entirely!
 I should mention that it's not just a vanity project and that ultimately I'd want this to positively impact my career in the mid term.

Long story short, I'm trying to see what's out there that could be integrated to a indoor location system that my employer has developed. A lot of potential customers love the idea that we can integrate with their two-way radio system and are okay potentially having to purchase new radio fleets to do that but aren't excited when we mention the gateways we offer need to be installed with roughly the same frequency as their existing wireless solution to accurately track the beaconing devices. 
 Just trying to see what is out there to be potentially beneficial to prospective customers by keeping them from having to have a bunch of fixed infrastructure installed. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hey, how are you guys? i need advice for a network automation and cmdb architecture. we have a network which is until now manually managed without any kind of automation (>5k users, multiple sites, just ipv4). we use: 
  
hpe imc for switch management (VLANs, ports, configs)
 infoblox for dns/dhcp and ipam
 currently device42 as cmdb but are switching to i-doit
  
devices: 
  
firewalls are checkpoint devices
 switches and routers are mostly hpe cw7
 aps are aruba
 fortigates for site to site vpns
  
ticketing system: jiranow i have to provide accurate data for our new cmdb (we switch from dev42 to i-doit) and to create a network automation solution. 
  
how could a network automation architecture look like for networks like this in general? where should i start and how could a project plan look like?
 whats a simple nsot? should we use nautobot or use concepts like using git a data source (but how would you provide an API then)?
 how would you manage comware devices - open source solutions unfortunately lack support for comware compared to cisco/arista/juniper etc.
 whats your advice providing data from our devices and systems to i-doit? should we establish a nsot, aggregate data there and provide a single api to the cmdb? or a proxy script like netpalm? connecting the cmdb directly to the devices/systems? connecting the cmdb to hpe imc?
  
i would be thankful for any kind of advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping for some advice on how to potentially isolate / pinpoint an issue on one of our internet circuits.
 The circuit is giving off odd performance issues. A typical speedtest via Oookla I'll not be able to get more than aoud 600Mbps down, upload I can peg out to 950 / 980Mbps. This is with a laptop directly connected to the providers NTE. Other speedtest sites can be terrible. UKFast / librespeed for example I'll struggle to get 100Mbps in fact any speedtest site other than Ookla gives terrible results.
 I've logged a support ticket with the provider and we did some iPerf tests during a change window. iperf tests from an endpoint on their network saw roughly a Gb up/down. so their response was that the circuit is fine.
 For me that only proved the bandwidth between those two points on their network can transmit 1Gbps and that there's an issue elsewhere. I've been advised by the provider that this is an 'internet issue' and there's nothing they can do.
 We have multiple 1Gbps internet circuits from the same provider, and an identical test from an alternate circuit shows me getting the full 1Gbps up/down, that to me proves it's something on their network.
 What other tests can I perform to help build my case with the supplier? 
 Appreciate any advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[just looking back at this year I'm realising how much I have developed some level of phone call anxiety due to dealing with some users in IT support
 This is the year that I have blocked numerous people on phone call, WhatsApp and skype more than i have ever done in my life due to users trying to evade the helpdesk, or call me at odd hours or when I'm off work...
 For example, we all took a break from work 3 days ago for the Christmas holidays and we are resuming work in the 1st week of January but today alone I've received 6 phone calls and 2 messages from some users which I have obviously ignored, yesterday it was 2 phone calls and 1 email -the level of disrespect for my personal time off is huge huge huge
 it has gotten so bad that i no longer answer 90% of phone calls from numbers that i don't have saved in my contacts. If i receive a phone call from an unsaved number i ignore it and do a quick look-up to see if its some person from work, if it's not i answer i.e if they call back again or i will call the person
 next year im just gonna be ruthless and more strict with this thing. When i joined the org 3 years ago i thought some of the seniors are just grumpy fellows who dont like to instantly and joyfully help some users (not that they are always like that) but there would be instances where i thought a user was given a cold shoulder -but now i seem to start getting it

I've yet to come across a satisfying way of dealing with the inevitable issue of multiple people with the same name. Like a lot of places we currently base our user accounts on the given name, however I've found in the past that numbering subsequent similar accounts creates confusion with emails etc, and can also create a feeling of hierarchy.
 What would be your ideal system of naming user accounts? Do you have please methods of dealing with this issue?
 Given that we've already issued many accounts which are basically just the person's name, do you have an original way of handling "john.smith2"?

 I'm not sure how to correctly ask this question, but here goes:
 I recently set up an Ubuntu server and shared a drive with Samba to my Macbook. I confirmed that it is working, however, I decided to change the user owner of the shared folder, now I'm unable to 'forget' the current network and re-add the drive with a different log in.
 I try to remove the credentials from the keychain and then do the Go > Connect to Server routine to get the share again, but when I try to import it, it doesn't ask for user or pass, it just automatically logs in as the previous credentials and they pop up again in the keychain.
 I hope this makes sense, could I please get some assistance with this?

Now when we use it, it installs Windows Pro, so I doublechecked, and compared it to my Pro stick, and the generic key in the file is in fact for Home.
 Is there something else that could cause this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stepped into a new role and have found a bit of a mess left behind by a previous administrator. 
 There is a group policy in place for our O365 that prevents older word files (I.E Word 95) from being opened. From what I understand, this Group Policy was implemented aprox 3 years ago. This is a very sensible Group Policy and I don't want to change it. 
 However, I've also discovered that there appears to be a raft of Word 95 documents still within the business. IT never converted the pre-existing Word 95 documents on our 8-or-so file servers. 
 It appears the plan to deal with this was to be 100% reactive. If a user cannot open a document, they raise a ticket and the HelpDesk would manually convert the file. I believe the idea was that the Word 95 files used within the business would eventually get converted this way and this will become a non-problem. But 3-years on, this still seems to drive calls to the HelpDesk.
 I'd rather pro-actively convert all our existing Word 95 files and call it a day. My problem is it's probably been a decade since I've needed to do a mass conversion of Word documents like this. And so far my Google-Fu has been failing me.
 Does anyone here have recent experience with a utility that'll scan a file server and convert old Word documents en-mass?

 ​
 How can i "upgrade" this Windows 10 ISO to Windows 11 so that each time i run it it installs Windows 11 -roughly 80% of our users were upgraded to Windows 11 on the new laptops acquired and should there be an issue that requires a windows reinstallation it would be a pain and great time consumer to start with that outdated ISO
 ​
 EDIT: I don't know the key for the Windows 10 ISO that we use, when I joined the organization I was handed the ISO file as part of work 'tools'. i don't deal with a key during or after installation

 I know confluence works together with Jira. We do some in-house development so Jira could be useful to us. But it's not like we are a codingshop that has multiple external clients that are in need of storyboards and such.

saas (yup, not even selfhosted on azure)
 kanban
 documentation
 some projectmanagement..

 Pretty new to this and I'm searching for an easy way to backup up to 10TB of data for a mid sized company. Let's say I have this data on a server in some RAID. Is it still a viable way to do a full backup once a week to a seperate drive and store it off-site? Wouldn't this take forever? As of today the company uses SharePoint which is quite problematic because it works dynamically and messes with the data sometimes. I want to do a backup once a week and not everytime something is changed. This backup is just for the case the office burns down so the RAID is destroyed in its entirety.
 Thanks!

 I have a lot (~100k in last 24hrs) of events 4771, 4625 and 4776 mixed together, for only one machine account. The reasons is always "User logon with misspelled or bad password" or "This is either due to a bad username or authentication information".
 It is Windows 7 Pro, fully updated (with no possibility to upgrade to Win10 due to lack of compatibility of installed software).
 All our domain controllers have installed Oct 2022 cumulative udpate.
 Computer is available in domain, I haven't noticed any issues using it , everyone can log on it, GPO are working. First thought - it's Win7, maybe old kerberos encryption used, so I've checked if computer is using DES / RC4 encryption - seems like it's not.
 I cannot confirm if this issue existed before November patch, I've seen it few days ago. Shoud I be concerned? Any ideas?

 I will preface this by saying that i'm new to networking and dont have so many years under my belt (1 year alltogheter, 6 months technical support B2B, 6 months technical support B2C).
 I'm currently working with a customer who has issues with bandwitdh, it is a 1gig link. The customer has two routers from us that are configured with redundancy (VRRP). Recently we tried to configure another gateway on their equipment and we suddenly see a increase in bandwitdh.
 When the VRRP group address is configured on the interface to the customer they only manage to measure 50 down and 50 up, while if we change the IP to one of the available IP's in the range, for example the next IP, the customer suddenly measures 900/900..
 The issue only seems to persist on one of the VLANS that is configured, with a /29 net
 As long as they configure one of the other IP's in the range as their default gateway they have no problems, but if they use the VRRP IP the problem appear.
 My understanding is that for the failover to function properly the customer has to use the VRRP IP as their default gateway, or else the clients dont know where to send their packets if R1 fails.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips for this problems.
 Keep in mind that I am new to this so my explanation may be lacking.

 ​
 I've been using Greenshot the screen capture program for years because unlike other programs I tried it was really simple and intuitive to use.
 ​
 For a couple months ago it's causing a problem of capturing my screen of the past; to be precise when I play borderless games and do a screen-capture, it captures the screen of my game when I last alt-tapped instead of my current screen.
 ​
 Is there a fix to this? Also are there any easy screen capture program not just trailered for streamers but for casual usage? It would be nice if it's simple to use for a layman and can capture videos too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a small fintect business (around 100 employees) as a data engineer. The majority of the company's key data is stored on a 1 TB prod Azure sql database (with matching dev and QA, and another smalled 300 GB SQL Server on-prem DB. A few analysts do power BI reporting off these data sources, and one of them connects to a pricing app our sales team uses. We are a microsoft shop basically.
 We are trying to implement true data management program, knowing that we have these needs but also wanting to cover some that we aren't even aware we need. We do know we want:
 - Data dictionary/catalog so analysts know what are the main tables that have the data they want power BI reports and our own compliance
 - Some way to assign data stewards who can keep the data catalog up to date
 - Ways to tag data as PHI, or what it's retention time is, to encourage privacy and retention compliance
 - Seeing lineage of our pipelines
 - Features that help consolidate records and the 'golden record' pursuit
 - In general anything helping us get to the goal of practicing data management.
 The obvious answer is Microsoft Purview, and it seems to click a lot of boxes and we are a microsoft shop, but I'm worried about the pricing. It seems like it could get expensive really quickly with the pay for use model, beyond any value it brings. We have a reasonable budget for data management but it's going to be hard to justify huge bills for what to most people will just be a data catalog.
 Other's I've looked at are data.world, altan, collibri, and alation. Then I see these open source versions with apache atlas or linkedin datahub and wonder if I should be going the free route and spin something entirely myself? I'm not trying to turn this into a sales post because I am skeptical of all of them despite knowing we need something :)
 Has anyone solved similar data management wants with any of these tools? Or have any general advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. Got a strange one that I am struggling with. We have a setup where has a pretty recent workstation with an AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM and an AMD Radeon Pro W5500 on Windows 11. The GPU as far as I can tell is the issue here, which is basically a cut down AMD RX 5700. When using the system normally, everything is fine, but when using it as an RDP host, connecting to it via a system with a Quadro K620 and a 4K monitor, it becomes a laggy mess.
 ​
 In group policy I have enabled the following:
 ​
 1 - Prioritize H.264/AVC 444 graphics mode for Remote Desktop Connections
 2 - Configure H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop Connections
 3 - Use Hardware Graphics adapters for all remote desktop services sessions
 ​
 I have this setup on another workstation that is currently using an old GTX 1080, and performance is excellent (I get random artifacting every once in a while, but overall it's usable). For testing purposes I installed this card into the test system, and performance improved considerably. When checking stats on hardware utilisation, the Nvidia card shows GPU encode activity, whilst the W5500 (and my RX 5700 from my home PC that I brought in for testing) never show any GPU encode activity.
 What is interesting is that the GPU has no problem encoding when using something like OBS.
 ​
 Any ideas what I can do here to improve RDP performance on a 4K monitor using an AMD GPU? Latest AMD drivers are currently installed. I would rather not have to replace the GPU if I could avoid it, it should have the ability to encode properly. Suggestions appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. Gonna preface this by saying I have almost no idea about anything web development or sysadmin stuff, so please bear with me. 
 I do quant related stuff and needed to build a basic web app for work. I made a short Python script, and used Streamlit to host it locally. It takes data from yahoo finance and does stuff with it. Nothing complicated. 
 It was working fine a week ago, but now when I run it, I get the following error (not verbatim but close):
 Cannot verify identity: self signed certificate in certificate chain
 The app loads (in Chrome) but throws this error along with others and doesn’t grab the data. 
 I’ve been trying to figure out the solution for probably 4 hours now and haven’t made any progress. I can’t continue the project until I solve this. It also doesn’t let me install packages. 
 If someone could hold my hand and walk me through this I would be immensely grateful. This shit is literally rocket science to me.
 I already asked in stackoverflow but nobody answered

 I haven't looked at other vendor solutions. I'm wondering if anyone can point me to some kind of vendor neutral design or point me to some vendor specific solution.

 I asked it for a RESTful API to accept an incoming webhook, check the data for inclusion of a string, extract a network address from the data, and make another external API call to update a list.
 It gave me probably 80% of the structure right off the bat. Decided to do a flask server with python3, in development mode. I asked it to please have that run in production mode. Boom, updated script and instructions for installing gunicorn along with the recommendation of running a reverse proxy in front of it. Asked it for http basic auth, boom first try. Not difficult things to do, but certainly easier to just ask and verify the answer.
 It definitely isn't perfect and will confidently give you some BS. But it's remarkable how often just calling out the BS will make it reconsider, apologize, and then fix it.
 I'd say it took a 2 day project down to about 5 hours. 40-50% of the code was written by me in the end, but that's damn a damn good improvement for one tool.
 Apparently there are already vscode plugins for it.

 There’s currently 2 Fortigates in HA with an aggregate interface configured that has port 1 as a member, this connects to an aggregate on a Meraki stack (2 switches, port 1 on each switch - this is a single aggregate interface). From what I understand, HA syncs the config between the Fortigates so each Fortigate will have its own aggregate interface - it looks like when this was first configured it was thought that port 1 on each firewall would be a member of the single aggregate interface. Assuming this is correct, each aggregate on …]]></summary>

I liked being that guy for quite awhile...the one where you went to if you needed something done in a hurry, or a problem solved that was otherwise unsolvable. But lately I'm finding that I'm getting more tired than inspired by the requests and more and more ground down as I handle everyone else's problems....but have no one to offload any of my own to. And I don't mind it (most days) from the user base - that's the job, after all - but from within my own department, from my own peers. I mean, I don't mind helping folks out but maybe, return the favor once in awhile? Maybe?
 How about the rest of y'all? Do you have someone who handles all the weird-ass crap that comes in or are you them? How many still find the challenges fun and how many now hide in a darkened datacentre like Gollum and his precious? What do you do when the weight of the escalations become too much? How much support do you get?

 I kind of like freshservice better between those two, but that’s only because we already live in the freshworks platform with freshdesk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I could've posted this in AITA (and even might still 'coz it's good content) but let's face it, no subreddit will understand this scenario better than this one. 
 School holidays are upon us and this means people are bringing kids (and ipads, and phones, and Nintendo Switches...) to work and demanding the WiFi so the kids have something to do all day. 
 Fair enough, I get it. We connect them to the guest WiFi, which is segmented from the network. Only problem (for them) is that the guest wifi is throttled at 5MBps and now the kids are complaining to their dads/mums/anyonewhowilllisten about how the WiFi sucks. This means their parents can't get any work done so they're complaining to me to "fix it" so Johnny can run his games/app/movie without disturbing them.
 I've explained that we throttle to protect the work connection but twice I've been told to "put them on the staff SSID". I've also explained the security risks associated with adding BYODs to the staff network and that this contravenes policy. 
 I'm not fearing an order to "connect them anyway" 'coz I have the autonomy/authority to reject that order but I am concerned about generating a hostile work environment. 
 I could increase the throttle to 10Mb. Short of that, any other ideas?

My terminology is not going to be right, so apologies. I am good with non business networking and wiring so I CAN understand.Can anyone theorize with me?
 This business is in what looks like condo's. They will get ATT Fiber coming in, and will get a router with that. Beyond that, I can do whatever, but there IS existing wiring to the walls, both upstairs and down, to ethernet jacks, carrying cat 6.
 The existing backbone is The panel, Existing, is a punchdown block, telephone style ish. I don't know the proper term. The ATT router will be left alone and installed as a stand alone piece, with wireless, but that's not sufficient for wireless for the whole place.
 SO....From the ATT router, I would like to have 2 switches come right off of that. THEN, I would like to terminate the cat 6 with rj45 ends, THEN plug those into one switch for the upstairs and one for the down. I can't see room to mount them, but It might be fine. There is NO give in the leftover from the block. THEN on each level, plug a wirless router into the switch to give better wireless.
 Beyond that, I am plugging 10-16 computers into each floor level at the wall, and one wired networked printer per level. I will manage the devices from the ATT router, but can do from each wireless router as well.
 I'm sure I'm not thinking of about 15 things.
 I'm trying to add a photo of the existing bloc, but this won't let me?? I am attempting to draw this up for my own concept understanding as well. It's going to take me a little while.
 Can anyone visualize this, and offer design advice? Am I at least on the right track?

 I hear horror stories about the big names like SAP and Oracle. I personally dislike Mircosoft, seeing as both Teams and Microsoft 11 are dogshit.
 The company where I currently work is in the midst of sacking up in order to move on from the truly hideous "ERP" system we currently use. I've posted about it before, but it's some partially-aborted, terribly maintained IBM AS/400 continuation. It contains our pricing, inventory, shipping, point of sale, manufacturing data, and lots of other info that I'm not currently privy to (working on it, but the disorganization of data is a whole other problem).
 I don't hate the Salesforce portion that our sales team uses, and I understand it has a fairly robust API ecosystem. 
 Does anyone have resources to research or any experience switching a(n) SME from a shit ERP to a less-shit one? The current solution is untenable, and our senior IT staff are getting quite senior. The underlying business (wholesale/distributing/manufacturing) is quite sound, so funding isn't as much of an issue. Buy-in from senior management/board of directors is the bigger problem (as always). 
 We are a 100-500 person company, NA-based USA HQ with ~10 locations in USA and Canada, and our aging workforce is a threat to irreparable loss of institutional knowledge.
 Thanks in advance for any help.
 Edit: Consensus opinion seems to be that ERPs are just shit. Which is what I feared. Time to get the checkbook out and pray. If anyone can DM me a recommendation to a decent ERP change consultant, that would be nice

 [centos@ss-data-exp-sc1-vm02 ~]$ iperf -c <ip> -p 25001 -l 4K -t 5 ------------------------------------------------------------ Client connecting to <ip>, TCP port 25001 TCP window size: 131 KByte (default) ------------------------------------------------------------ [ 3] local 10.2.19.0 port 58237 connected with 10.2.18.254 port 25001 [ ID] Interval Transfer Bandwidth [ 3] 0.0- 5.0 sec 922 MBytes 1.55 Gbits/sec 
 How to explain 922 Mb as part of 'transfer' column?
 How to control transfer amount?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our team would like to set up a file server for around 100 users for back up, sync, sharing, and collaboration. 
 The standard solution is O365, GSuit or something like Box.com. The problem is, management doesn’t like transferring business data over to these companies. Solutions where the data remains on premise are preferred. I understand! 
 Nextcloud is usually considered in these scenarios. I am not an expert. I have used nextcloud for personal use, and still learning it (eg, learning about different installation options). I also read a lot about it online. I personally like the software, but from my experience in the past years, I am a bit worried about updates getting broken between major versions, security vulnerabilities with a complex PHP app, and bugs impacting user experience. The web interface will remain open to LAN. 
 Do you have any experience with nextcloud in a small business scenario? How secure, robust and reliable is it, as a working replacement to something like Box.com?
 Anyone deploys nextcloud in production?
 On the other hand, I see governments in Germany and France and various institutions use it. I suppose they audited and vetted the code before adopting it. If it’s good for them, it might be good for small businesses too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have a peculiar problem that needs solving. I have undertaken a project that requires data to be moved from multiple locations (let's say 10 for example) to a Central storage server. The problem is that none of the locations will be online, and cannot be online ever, so data must be moved physically by transporting the disks to the central location and unloading the data to the server.
 The satellite locations will have RAID-1 storage pools of 2 disks. Each location will have 4 pools. So in total we have 40 pools of 80 disks that need to be transported to another location, somehow mounted and have all their data copied over to the storage server.
 This will need to happen every month for a year.
 Have you ever done something like this? How would you approach it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit***I've figured out my method of looking at this isn't going to happen. It's not a network limitation it's the software. There's an online process and constant handshake that needs to be maintained and so my idea won't work. But this has opened up other ideas that are theoretically easier. Appreciate the responses!!
 ***Original
 If I am a complete idiot for this line of thinking please don't hesitate to let me know.
 I am currently running two identical separate networks (Main and Backup) each with only two machines on them - one "controller" and one "server". These networks are very static both logically and physically. Always the same computers.
 Everything is on the same subnet and the controllers can be any IP I want but the servers have to be the same IP. If they're not the same IP I have to do a ridiculous amount of reconfiguring every time I copy things from Main to Backup.
 Here's my question:
 Is there a way I can send the same TCP/IP to two identical networks or IP addresses?
 I was thinking about getting a 4-port mini PC and trying to use PureData to create a routing system and trying to use Mac addresses but maybe there's an easier way? Or maybe this won't ever work at all (because of what I say next)?
 I realize this is a situation that networking is generally designed to avoid but this isn't a typical data network - it's a live show TCP/IP based control network with no external connections and/or surprises. I'm hoping I can find a way to make this work!

 ​
 1) Auto import orders as soon as they are made (hopefully every CRM)
 2) Attach photos to a specific order (be able to upload different images directly on a clients order that can be seen by employees)
 3) Have different bench marks employees can check off on each order (submitted to suppliers, order approved, declined)
 4) Be able to send emails for updates on a specific order (remind X employee to check this order again in 3 days, remind me to check for X in 5 days for this order)
 5) Easy to use and a design that will make all of the above easy to do

 if someone can recommend a CRM that can do this all I will be especially happy and maybe offer a small reward :) thanks everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent 15+ years as a sysadmin with a couple different orgs and over the past two years moved quickly through the mgmt track (first manager now director). While the team is hitting all the right notes (in fact exceeding expectations in some areas), I’m not sure I want it. I’m feeling burned out and the farther I get from ‘mashing the keys’ the more unhappy I seem to be. Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve just received an offer to go back to a more technical role and kind of feel a bit of the golden handcuffs as the offer is 20% less. For those of who have felt this, did you go back to making a bit less coin for more of a happiness play?

 I'm in a competition called CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition), which puts you in a "Real" business, and has tasks(keeping a server and webpage up), patching your firewall, "setting up" printers, and other day to day stuff while under attack from Red Hats. All that just to say, I was looking for advice and help in finding services online/books that can assist me in preparing for this competition. 
 I've started doing some CTF stuff, learning from hackthebox academy, stack overflow, my team mates, and coaches.
 I personally will be monitoring the network(ports open, network traffic, services running, and firewalls) and any resources that covers that would be amazing. 
 Edit start: The OS is released a week before the start, but most the time it's a well known distribution of linux(normally ubuntu) and/or Windows Servers.
 This competition isn't until February, so I have a bit of time to learn!
 Edit end.
 Thanks!
 (sorry if this is the wrong group, real nervous to post anything online 0-0)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 Not a sysadmin, looking for some thoughts on a high quality kinda future proof, 10g switch for the following gear for mainly file sharing.
 - Up to 10 x 10g users (Mostly 10GBase-t because of short distance and our current NICs, I didn't know SFP runs cooler otherwise that'd been my choice for nics in the past, such as shame)
 - IXsystems All flash Truenas R20 with dual 10G Base_t (Once fully loaded can support more throughput and possibly can upgrade nics to dual 25g or more)
 Options:
  
S5860-20SQ (Seems packed with features, good price and expandability, I like how it has support for 25g and 40g which my truenas might need in the near future. But it needs transivers for my current RJ45 equipment)
 HPE Aruba Instant On 1960 12XGT (I guess software/support is better than FS, not sure? Has both copper and fiber)
 Cisco Business 350 (I didn't hear good things about it on reddit, seems like not really enterprise quality cisco)
 QNAP QSW-M1208-8C or similar. No comments, I have one and it worked well in a different gear. It's cheaper than the others but I don't want the cheapest now. I want the most reliable that has room for growth.
 CRS312-4C+8XG-RM Lots of great features and it's cheap but again cost is not my main concern

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, I’m dealing with some super old systems I need to migrate from Nutanix to ESX. The reason is the Nutanix block is so freaking old it’s massively failing. Like I told them 2 years ago they needed to get off this shit as it was showing issues, we couldn’t even get extended support, and everything else in shop is esx.
 We’ll I’m running in to an issue now that seems to be server 2008r2 + VMware tools related.
 On all these systems when installing vmwaretools 12.X+ everything seems to work, but if the server hasn’t been used in a bit it takes a moment for the network to “wake up”. What I mean is that if you log on to the console you’ll need to do a ping -t and let it fault for 10-15 times before it starts responding and then works fine from there on out. I tried the last supported version of tools I could find, 11.3, but this didn’t seem to rectify the issue.
 I’ve also made sure to remove the Nutanix guest tools and everything I could think of that might be interfering.
 I’m not seeing this behavior on why if the 2012R2, 2016, win10, etc…. VMs I’ve migrated. Just the 2008R2. 
 Anyone ran in to this before or have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have some Cisco M5 servers that are running ESXi. These servers have 2 x X710 Dual Port NICs. We are noticing that in some of our load tests, we start seeing our dropped packets start to increment. When we dump the nic statistics in ESXi, we see Rx Missed counters are increasing. Someone told us that the Ring Buffers were dropping packets, and that the solution was to enable Receive Side Scaling (RSS). So we looked into that. 
 Inside of the ESXi operating system (VMWare proprietary Linux), the adaptors are using a driver named i40en. The driver is loaded as a kernel module. Per VMWare docs, enabling RSS involves passing parameters to the kernel module. We noticed there were two RSS Parameters (DRSS and RSS), which led us down a path of trying to figure out which one we needed to be configuring. We learned that there are two types of Receive Side Scaling: NetQ (RSS), and Default Queue RSS, the latter being newer. Since we didn't see any mention of DRSS in the Intel X710 documentation, we proceeded to set the RSS values to 4 queues per adaptor. We re-ran the test expecting a Eureka result, but nope - we still see the Rx Missed. 
 On this issue, we keep flapping between VMWare (who owns the OS), Cisco (who owns the server) and Intel (who makes the X710 adaptor). Can anyone shed any insight on this Rx Missed issue, and point us in a direction to go down that might fix this issue? We have to figure this out before we can allow a service to be rolled out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay so looking for a bit of advice here I've previously done roles where I was the sole IT support for the site, which was fine, I always was able to escalate if needed:
 Currently joined an international company where various IT roles are segmented, I'm (IT Ops) but we have a production network team, a internal network team, infra team, AD/Exchange team, even a procurement team all within IT. (When I joined I thought great!) 
 The issue I have is I'm currently running 3 projects which require communication accross multiple teams, and sometimes even simple tasks like shared mailbox setup take forever as they come to me first, and instead of just doing it.. I have to send it to the messaging team, then have no visibility of the case, so chasing up what I can't see for a relatively simple case becomes a headache. 
 On the other hand one of the other projects involves Setting up bespoke software (provided by the vendor) on a server provided by the production network team (None of whom are based in my country) and I cannot even install the software as their server is on their network, and their vlan that I have no access to, RDP copy paste is disabled etc 
 This meant I had to log a case with them to request them to open SMB traffic/share to our network so I can transfer the files. To which they said no. And then messaged my boss asking what was taking so long... 
 This isn't really a rant, some of the teams mentioned above are very helpful (rather some if their members are) and I have a good working relationship with them, however the above is a regular occurrence. 
 Basically I'm looking for advice on how other people manage this if they are in the same situation, or any tips, cheers in advance!

 Then I asked ChatGPT and... the answer was perfect.
 This is what I had after asking "How can I automatically set up out of office messages for disabled accounts in a specific OU ?" :
  # Replace "OU=Disabled Accounts,DC=contoso,DC=com" with the distinguished name of your OU $ou = "OU=Disabled Accounts,DC=contoso,DC=com" # Get a list of disabled accounts in the OU $disabledAccounts = Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $False} -SearchBase $ou # Set the out-of-office message for each disabled account foreach ($account in $disabledAccounts) { Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration -Identity $account.SamAccountName -AutoReplyState Enabled -ExternalMessage "I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your message. I will get back to you as soon as possible." -InternalMessage "I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your message. I will get back to you as soon as possible." } 
 Now, I know the tool isn't flawless, however, have you guys considered using it just like you do with Google to solve these kind of things ?

That said, I am currently running a copy on a Windows 11 machine with its version of RC that comes preinstalled. I started noticing my /PURGE /NOCOPY options on batch command lines didn't seem to be working the same anymore. (subdirs were no longer being purged) So I added /S /E and it started copying zillions of files & directories instead of removing files. I verified there were a lot of new folders I did not want there, that weren't there prior to changing those parameters. I removed the /E and tested again, it looked like it was creating new directories, but when I looked at the destination it wasn't doing that anymore (like it think it should be working)
 I did see a blurb on the new Win11 RC version help page about them changing what happens on a certain system folder with /PURGE, but saw nothing about other changes to it.
 I did NOT go back and test older version, so maybe I only thought it was working and removing files from sub-folders if they weren't on the source. Don't know, and I won't invest any more time in that.
 So now with the added /S, but no /E its removing files/folders in sub-directories like I wanted/expected and not copying stuff.
 The /E option on that /PURGE line really screws the pooch! JFYI. -Bill

Is this even a problem?
 is it the lack of quote marks that caused this?
 Are there commands I can run to change these to the email address?
  
Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We at FilesNow are in the process of developing a new file sharing and storage service, and we're looking for some feedback and suggestions from the sysadmin community.
 What are some key features that you look for in a file sharing and storage service? In your experience, what has made a file sharing service stand out to you?
 We are aiming to create a service that is reliable, easy to use, and has good security features. Some other features that we're considering include the ability to share files with external collaborators, integration with other tools and platforms, and the ability to manage permissions and control access to files. Additionally, we want to offer robust file storage capabilities, including the ability to store and access large files, as well as support for various file formats.
 We'd love to get your thoughts on what features would be most useful for sysadmins and what would make our file sharing and storage service stand out in the market.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'll get right into my question:
 I've been working for 1 company for ~1,5 years by now. 6 months as anykey, 10 as system administrator. We have a small team of 3 people: me, lead system administrator and team leader. Company consist of 100 people in architecture department and about 100 in first-line tech support.
 Soo, I really like my job, my team have amasing chemistry, I can do almost all tasks independently, but I think that I'm sitting on the same place in terms of knowledge. All of our servers are almost 100% windows-based, and I do usually some simple things like managing users in AD, some share-server based stuff and of course managing problems with user's pc, but nothing extraordinary.
 And what I'm thinking that if I tried to switch a job now, I wouldn't pass an interview. I know how to do things but it is usually limited and on sense-based level rather solid knowledge.
 I'm feeling like I'm back on square one when I haven't got a job at all and I waster 1,5 years for nothing. 
 In advance I'll say that I try to learn new things of course, I try to make a note in Obsidian daily about networking and so on, but I can admit that I'm really not the brightest system administrator, so many things are quite hard for me.
 My question is it really I have imposter syndrome or is it a normal state? And, I know it is hard to give answer to that, what can I do to improve me so I can be valuable asset on a market?
 ​
 Many thanks in advance, and sorry for any possible language mistakes - I tried to catch them all, but who knows)

All went well apart from domain joining which only worked on Ethernet. The WiFi deets are correct because users can sign in immediately after provisioning is finished. The only thing I can think is happening is that it tries to domain join before adding the WiFi profile?

After some googling I came to conclusion that there is no way around having to own a range of IP addresses that I can assign to individual hosted applications. However, it seems that getting a range of addresses is both too hard and expensive and probably impossible for an individual (I do not want to create a company just for a hobby service). For example, my RIR is APNIC and the membership application requires corporate contacts.
 What is the easiest way to obtain a range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses as an individual?

 This setup was working perfectly fine for a long time. Client authenticates through RADIUS with his / her AD UN PW to wifi. No config changes were done afterwards. Recently some of the clients started complaining not being able to connect to wifi. This was fixed with a simple RADIUS server reboot. Then the issue became persistent. Now nobody can connect to wifi. I checked the RADIUS event log and apparently it cannot connect to AD (DC). But they both are in the same subnet, and I can ping the AD (DC) from RADIUS server. No firewall restrictions. I cannot figure out where the problem is. If someone can please point me in the right direction that'll be helpful. TIA.
 "Audit Failure
 Event ID: 6274
 Reason Code: 5
 Reason: The Network Policy Server was unable to connect to a domain controller where the account is located. Because of this, authentication and authorization for the RADIUS request could not be performed."

 I configured a trunk port from the fortiswitch to the pfsense firewall with native vlan 1 and allowed(tagged) vlan 20. This works as expected. I can still access the switch on the default network, and I can add vmware vms to vlan 20 and everything works as expected.
 However, I cannot replicate this on my Juniper. I attempted the same configuration (trunk port with native vlan 1 and tagged vlan 20) but when I do this I can no longer access the switch IP nor ping it (it doesnt appear to work on either 1 or 20). What am I missing that I need to configure for this to work on my Juniper? 
 Below is the output on the interface being used as the trunk.

While our IT department is a coworker and I + our boss who mainly does infrastructure, we are a company with a single office and about 160 people so until now we got by. Today the CEO dropped the bomb that we will expand from 1 to 3 offices over 12 months with around 40-50 new people for the new offices.
 My coworker and I are in the middle of organising and redesigning many processes and polices, together with a new infrastructure for a new software and implementing an intranet so 2023 was already packed. With the news we have to do the work that we planned on padding out over the year (also to be able to do our day to day tasks) in the next 4 months so we can develop solutions to our new issues with having more than 1 office (most of our infrastructure is in our local server rooms so we have to think if this will suffice).
 I am genuinely scared of the sudden rise in scope (neither our grown infrastructure nor our company policies and culture are, as of today, fit for the new environment), but also excited to not only execute the plan but also co-developing that plan

 This script recursively converts all .rar and .zip archive files to the superior .7z format, set for highest compression.
  
Can specify formats to convert (in the VARIABLES section in the top of the script). Defaults are .rar and .zip
 
After each file is converted, the original archive is deleted, leaving only the new .7z archive
 
Logs by default to c:\logs\ (can be changed in the VARIABLES section)
 
Starts from the directory it was launched from and recurses down subdirectories from that point
 
 >> Script on Github <<
 I used this script to convert a lot of old log files we're required to keep around from Zip to 7-Zip, which saved ~380 GBs of space by the time it was done.

 This week I got a message when signing in to the Azure portal that there was a new conditional access policy created. I checked the CA policies and saw that a new 'Require MFA for admins' policy was created. In the logs it said this was done by an admin account of our MSP who does some support work for us.
 We didn't get noticed or gave the MSP an assignment to set this up. So I messaged our contact at the MSP and after some research from their side they say the CA policy was created automatically without their intervention.
 I can see clearly in the logs that their admin account created the CA policy but I'm not too experienced with Azure and CA policies. Is automatically creating a CA policy with MFA even possible in Azure AD?

 I understand that this greatly depends on size of the network, scalability, certification-requirements, etc. - but I want your input. I personally like using the firewall for a single pane-of-glass and ease-of-use.
 ​
 So - What do you think? Should L3 be managed on the firewall or at a core switch? Why? Change my mind!

Just wondering what kind of success/burn people have with them. To go with a <3K optic and it burn you and have to replace it with 80K optics is a pretty big gut punch. Even Cisco branded optics fail, so some failure doesn't scare me due to redundant links. I just don't want to be constantly swapping them either or worry about MTTF's lining up like you get with raid arrays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i have this topology in a mininet emulation:
 h1/h2 ---- s2 ---- s1 ---- s3 ---- h3/h4
 All links are restricted to 1Gbps.
 When i use iperf3 to send TCP traffic from h1 to h3, it gets close to that bw and everything seems fine. When i create two concurrent flows that go e.g. from h1 to h3 or both from h1 to h3 and from h1 to h4, the bandwidth they get also adds up to close to 1Gbps.
 However, when i concurrently have a flow running from h1 to h3 and one from h2 to h4, their summarized bandwidth is way worse and almost never exceeds 300 Mbps.
 There are some more retransmissions shown in iperf3 in this last scenario as well, but i don't really get why that is and i think that just the workings of congestion control causing a decrease of link utilization to below 30% seems unlikely.
 The retransmissions come in small bursts and those appear only every few seconds on average, which also seems too large of an in-between time to have me think that packet drops are causing this. This sounds more like timeouts, but then there should be quite some ACKs being dropped and why would that be?
 Cubic is configured on all end hosts. RTT measured by ping is mostly between 80 and 130 microseconds.
 Before i dig down further into the depths of congestion control (calculating timeouts and looking at whether the ACKs make it in time), i was wondering whether someone had any insights on whether that is normal behaviour or what else could be happening.
 Both memory and CPU utilization of any of the cores stay below 100%.

 Some people say their IP geolocation is wrong, but even if it’s not accurate, as long as it’s consistent, it could still be useful if you get a notification showing a login attempt from a new IP address in a completely different location.
 Some users may not like it even if it’s accurate because they will feel like their employer is tracking their movements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are considering upgrading our small environment to 4x HP DL360's Gen10+, TrueNAS R10 storage array, and two 10 GigE core switches along with 3x 48-port POE+ switches with 10Gig uplinks to to the core switches. 
 Initial thought: Two Netgear M4300 with 12-port Copper (for the network traffic) and 12-port SFP+ DAC (for the storage traffic) but read that copper is hot and higher latency. So will get a switch with only SFP+ ports. DAC will be used in the server room and fiber to the 48-port switches that are through out the building.
 Does it make sense to just run a single SFP+ DAC from each server to each switch that will handle both network traffic and storage traffic or do I run two cables to each switch from each server and split the traffic? 
 I know Netgear is not enterprise grade hardware but $2,500 vs $12,000 for an Aruba 3810M seems like a major difference. Any vendors that are between the two as far as cost and feature set? For that price difference, I can have a spare Netgear on hand.
 For my DR site, I plan on having a duplicate TRUENAS R10 and 3x DL360's servers and nothing else. Can I eliminate the switches entirely and just run 3 DAC cables to the TrueNAS and plug the 3 servers directly into my two Fortinet 80F firewalls via GigE?

 They were big on team work, working together, and being able to think critically within a team environment. I then realized that I painted a picture that I do most of my work alone (which is mostly true) but I highlighted times in my past & current roles that I worked in a team setting so they understood that I can do the work but more than happy and ready to work with like-minded ppl and have that transfer of knowledge that I was not getting in my current role. I got that squared away and closed the interview feeling that I was able to convey "hey I can do the job and I miss working within a team environment with like-minded ppl and I am ready to learn and put in the work"
 I received my offer later that evening. They wanted to make sure I would fit well within the 9 person team and be willing to learn. 
 Thanks everyone who mentioned softskills are important. I am now a Network Administrator!

 I handle all of the IT infrastructure (End User Support, Sys Admin, Net Adm, etc.) and the current networking environment is running very old and EoL HP switches. I currently have a Fortigate 81f with HA installed with FortiManager. Along with that, we use FortiEMS and Forticlient for VPN, Anti-Virus, etc. I am considering the Fortiswitches. There is no inter VLAN happening, nothing layer 3, no PoE, just basic layer 2 routing. Keep in mind, this is for a small business, no larger than 60 employees. Would it be wise to switch to all Fortiswitches since I already have a Fortigate and Fortimanager? I had a demo and it was a huge difference compared to the current HP switches. 
 ​
 Has anyone used Fortiswtiches in a small business environment: no more than 10 switches. Are they reliable, dependable, or should I just stick with the big brands such as Cisco and Aruba? 
 Thanks for your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is about 20% Outlook rant and 80% wanting to share the laugh I had this morning. 
 We use O365 and I'm constantly struggling to keep up with the new features M$ decides we want. If something particularly useless or potentially confusing to users shows up I'll usually track down the GPO to disable it.
 Today a user came into my office to report a problem with her email reactions. I didn't know what she was talking about. She proceeded to show me that a couple weeks ago a new emoji button showed up alongside her Forward and Reply buttons in Outlook. I told her I'd look into it but that it sounds like a pointless new feature some people might have a little bit of fun with when it eventually rolls out to the rest of the company. 
 I could tell this response had more of an impact than the brush-off response I intended it to be - she then explained she had stopped sending replies to the majority of the emails she received from her team, opting to instead hit the 'Thumbs Up' emoji to indicate that their messages were seen and approved. I can only assume people thought they were being ignored. For weeks. 
 I also haven't been able to enable this feature on my own Client. I have Preview Mode on and am on the most up to date build.

Everyone is in a workgroup, no server, and no AD whether it be on-prem or Azure. We are slowly getting them up to speed. We have the new server and domain in place and all the computers are joined to that domain. 
 Currently, all of their data is in Dropbox. They are wanting to move from Dropbox to their new on-prem server because their Dropbox business account is getting pricey as they grow. Does Dropbox have any special migration tool like Sharepoint does or do I simply just download all of their data onto the server from Dropbox?
 I just did a few google searches and every article talks about moving from on-prem TO Dropbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clarification: I know that pseudowire is a specific thing: a transparent, multipoint and redundant backhaul that encapsulates other protocols to allow them to operate as if they were on a native P2P network.
 In my long history, pseudowire has essentially been two things: MPLS MetroE/MAN/WAN to facilitate public IP circuit sales to end customers or intranet aggregation between multiple regional offices allowing communication between physical locations without logically going out to the public internet. 
 I've been reflexively using "pseudowire" when referring to SD-WAN type devices that do something similar with a standard public facing interface for public internet and a virtual/tunnel interface for intraoffice aggregation.
 When using this terminology with folks my age, they either understand what I mean or don't speak up to say they don't/ask for clarification/etc. However, recently had a conversation with some in their early 20's who had no idea of what I was talking about. 
 Wondering if pseudowire is just a "Oldman referring to Rust as BASIC" or if the advent of SD-WAN as a VPN appliance has deprecated the usage of that term.

They open any Office app and the Active Office box comes up, they enter their e-mail then another box comes up saying "Sign in to get started with Office". You can sign in and again or skip sign in. If they try and sign in it goes back to this box in a loop. Some details, all of our users have Office x64, Windows 10 Enterprise mostly 21H2 and Hybrid AD Joined. I've tried running the MS SARA tool that fixes activation issues, didn't work. There is no entry for an Office credential in credential manager to delete. We are using MFA in our environment. It's affecting a small amount of users but we've yet to find a fix.

 I'm now going to make a big assumption - that Microsoft actually back up your setttings somewhere and it's possible to restore from a previous version.
 If this assumption is correct, how do I do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try keep this brief. My goal is to eventually become an SWE, and I've spent the last ~2 years self-teaching via Udemy courses, Harvard CS50, and other similar resources, learning Python, some JS, a very small amount of SQL.
 All of my professional work experience to date is in the automotive/customer service industry. The last several years I've been an automotive Service Advisor at a dealership in a wealthy area. I'm no stranger to difficult/entitled people and how to deal with them. I see this as one of my skill sets that may set me apart from others trying to enter the field. So with this in mind, I've shifted gears over the last several months a bit more toward the SysAdmin side to earn my A+ certification, and just this week I earned my Network+ and CIOS badges.
 My reasons for this are:
  
Develop some more foundational knowledge of how hardware/software/networking work because having a greater understanding of that can obviously be helpful.
 Have something concrete to put on my resume other than "I've been watching a lot of videos and practicing".
 As stated above, entering IT on the SysAdmin side may be a clearer path to getting into IT for me, given my background.
  
MAIN TLDR QUESTIONS;
  
Is it common for people hoping to become developers to enter via help desk or similar role, then transition to SWE? Or is it generally better to pick one patch and go all in?
 Should I go for my Security+ and get the "trifecta" before throwing applications out? This leads me to the next bullet point
 I'm supporting a family of 5, and my wife does not currently work because our children are still young and not all in school yet. I need to make $80k+ to be able to afford our monthly expenses. Is it feasible for someone without a degree to enter the field making that kind of money? I'm in central Maryland, so the median salary is certainly above average for the US.
  
Any and all advice appreciated. TIA

 then another key (again doesn't matter what key it is , it just have to be different from the first key pressed) 5 time
 then another key (again any other key but different then the other two) 1 time

 I've searched forums etc but nothing appears to solve this issue. I have even extracted the working driver from my machine (I added it manually to test the correct driver) and 'replaced' it on the PRTServer. 
 Has anyone seen this before and if so, how did you resolve it?!

 I have always had the assumption that the younger crowd was better with newer tech, but may struggle with older systems. My generation (GenX) grew up building their own PCs and doing a ton of stuff "from scratch" like creating boot disks and having to actually install a TCP/IP stack. 
 Now though you can grab an iPhone or iPad and they just work for 90% of the things you want like email, web and messaging. If you're heavy into social media you may not even use a browser much as things like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. all have apps.
 I supposed you could blame the fact that since these newer things work so well that skills like troubleshooting and figuring things out by building them have withered. 
 Anyone have any anecdotal takes on this?

 I want to upgrade that server-to-server link to 25GbE. I’m looking at the AOC-S25G-m2S. But I’ve never tried doing a server-to-server connection using a SFP28 DAC before.
 Assuming I know how to configure the interfaces in software, will using a SFP DAC cable just work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Recently I've been tasked with enrolling bitlocker in our environment. As we don't have AAD and introducing MBAM did not seem to be worth the effort for our small scale environment, we decided to create just the policy and then activate encryption manually via script per workstation. It suits our needs as we slowly switching from old computer vendor hodgepodge to standardized modern enterprise Dell workstations. The policy was thoroughly tested and I've determined it works and is safe to use company wide, then GPO was applied "wide" on almost all workstation containers. I was 100% sure nothing will happen because everywhere i looked GPO managed bitlocker need a manual trigger of some sorts to encrypt the drive by design. Just one day after policy rollout we noticed some of our new Latitude 3420 we gave to the users earlier in the week have bitlocker encryption active. Good thing recovery keys are present in AD but loosing the control of the process is major concern. It's especially weird as it happen only to the latitude laptops. The optiplexes 3000 are behaving as expected. I've read about Dell OOBE bitlocker encryption but it shouldn't effect us as we reimage all computers straight out of the box using WDS. Investigation of windows events gave me nothing to hold on to. It seems like one time event per host because once decrypted it wont happen again. My hypothesis is that WSD <WillWipeDisk>true< is not clearing bitlocker partition containing some sort of residual Dell ransomware but it does not seem likely. 
 What are your thoughts?

 I'm not that comfortable with Windows so what I want to know is: is it even remotely possible to do a ssh tunnel through machine B even though I t doesn't have the ssh-server installed?
 And before someone answers: don't punch holes in your company's security - there's another company working on the same environment with much fewer security restrictions and I'm constantly getting complaints why are they doing things so much faster (idk Karen, maybe because they don't need 15 minutes to manually transfer artefacts through 3 jumphosts and can use rsync and other sane tools).

 I'm a PKI administrator at a MSP and have to deal with certificates, CRLs and everything else on a daily basis (and 15+ years in experience). In order to take away the fear and insecurity of certificates from some of my colleagues, I would like to shoot a kind of promotion tour for certificates.
 However, in order to develop and create this, I first need to understand why many admins have a real fear of certificates. Is it because certificates have a defined expiration date, which cannot be jerked even in the event of a major disruption?
 Maybe you have some more ideas or can report from your daily admin life.

 To confirm, this is the behavior we would expect, right?! The “don’t ask again for 30 days” is specific to the device that they made that action on…

 On top of this, lots of people have Shared Mailboxes and I believe this might be adding to the overall size and causing some freezing/access issues. 
 What solutions do you use for archiving old emails?
 how does it work for people accessing only through the cloud?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[20 years in this game. Basically, all I've ever done. Got paid to defrag shit in the late 90s. Got paid to remove 11 IE toolbars in the early 2000s. Got paid to actually work as helpdesk in the late 2000s, into MSP world shortly after, and have essentially bounced back and forth between Fortune 500 and MSP. I'm in the trenches. I've called the vendors. Fought the contractors. Managed the managers. Blah... blah.
 ​
 I'll probably get "Fuck AT&T" etched on my headstone. I struggle to think of two words I've put together more frequently. 
 Consumer wireless/internet/TV? Check. Fuck 'em. 
 Business DSL/UVerse/IPFlex/BVoIP? Check. Fuck 'em.
 It's not even necessarily the service. Or the price. Although both of those .... well, aren't the best.
 It's the support. I can't think of a more frustrating thing to do than to call AT&T because something is wrong. TODAY? 6 hours. Not done yet, either, but done for the day. I can't count the departments, personnel, time zones, cultures, and frustrations that I encountered along the way. The first call is never the right call, nor the second, rarely the third, and your chances of success only creep upwards from there.
 Man... Fuck AT&T.
 ​
 ​
 PS - if anybody got those good resources, whatever department, if you know a good number to get a specific thing done... maybe this rant turns into a saving grace. Maybe it's just another rant on the internet. Yes, it's short, far as rants go. I'm tired. I called AT&T today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently doing a lot of interviewing but am fully employed. However, recently quiet a lot of companies have taken interest in my resume and are reaching out. An issue I am conflicted about is, would it a bit awkward during an interview with a hiring manager to ask about if they see the role staying around? I know the economy is up in the air right now and I hear about layoffs, but not sure if that is a turn off for employers if you ask something about that. Since usually the first to enter are also the first to go when it comes to layoffs. 
 Just as a potential employee I would not want to get hired and then when the new year arrives get laid off.

Especially with how hard MS are pushing to kill IE once and for all and have everyone move onto Edge, to have no support for Edge for 9 months while the OS is supported seems really bizarre.
 If this is a Chromium thing that's out of MS's hands, I'd have thought they'd have enough clout to delay any underlying changes so they're not leaving this OS exposed like this?
 And yes, of course getting off 2012 R2 is the best option but not really the point of this.

 Obviously the configs will essentially be a copy/paste and what not, but how would you guys/gals go about cutting them over with the least amount of impact? 
 Since we’re utilizing vPC, could i just get vPC up and running on my new 3k’s and then cut over each port channel one link at a time? 
 Just wanted to get some thoughts/advice. 
 Much appreciated!

These past 6 months have been absolute torture. Our company fired 2 of our 4 techs in span of two months. Our client base has only gotten larger. Raises haven't been handed out. Me and my single other coworkers workload has gotten enormous to the point where we can barely function. We have both expressed our concerns to the owners but they seem to fall on deaf ears. I guess my question is, does it ever get better? The Stress? The anger and frustration? Anyone have any suggestions on how they dcompress? This job has all but ruined technology for me. The main reason I originally went into IT was because I just love the satisfaction of fixing something that is broken, especially in tech. But that passion is gone. I know I haven't been in the game that long so I don't want to write off the industry as a whole, but I'm genuinely gonna lose it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I have an issue that has been a complete PITA to troubleshoot and resolve.
 Infrastructure backstory:
 Core device is a fiber aggregation switch stack (2x Cisco C3850-12XS) that all MDF and IDFs connect to over LACP port channels (Fiber Sw 1 <> M/IDF Sw 1, Fiber Sw 2 <> M/IDF Sw 2).
 Wireless is handled by cloud management, no on-prem controller.
 Issue:
 Generally excessive amount of %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF logs popping up in the fiber switch. Switch 2 interface for Port-Channel 5 and 6 have repeated state changes and appears to be related. The state change doesn't happen at the same time and is not consistent but does happen almost daily. Also, only the fiber switch side's interface is having this state change.
 Troubleshooting:
 Both fiber switches have been rebooted.
 Swapped the SFP modules from Sw 1 to Sw 2 and vice versa. State change issue remained on Sw 2.
 Only thing I haven't done yet was to move the SFP modules to completely new ports as this is remote site and I'm waiting on an onsite visit to get that accomplished.
 I am aware of the "why" this is happening, insofar as the MAC flaps caused by the end users roaming between APs that are on different switches, so it sees the MAC twice. What I'm perplexed on is why it's causing a couple interfaces to constantly drop. The drop is not causing noticeable issues and doesn't bring down the port-channel, just constantly state changing.

 Yes, I know they are EoL. Yes, I know the ports are oversubscribed. I'm fine even with the 6 Gbps per slot bandwidth of classic modules. Yes, I know they are power hogs.
 That being said, if I load a switch up with 384 SFP ports, it looks like it will only use about 1 KW of power. That isn't totally unreasonable. It's less than 3 W per port.
 Feel free to check my math:
  
redundant supervisors and chassis 554 W
 
8 x WS-X4448-GB-SFP @ 65 W each totalling 520 W
 
 Grand total 1074 W / 384 ports = 2,8 W per port
 So, what do y'all say? Yay or nay?

The recipient is on Office 365
 The URL to their website is in the body.
  
The problem is even when you look at the Office 365 data it shows that DMARC and SPF passed AND that the URL in the body was not a threat.
 I have literally no data telling me why it was quarantined. We opened a ticket with Microsoft and it basically went nowhere. They wanted us to add it to the allow list in the account we were using for testing and they couldn't comprehend the bigger picture that this is a problem for anyone on Office 365 that they send to.
 What can we do in this situation? Microsoft's own portal says the URL is not a threat, we even checked the sending IP's, the smart host IP's and the website for blacklists (there were none). Has anyone been in this situation?

 One device is a laptop, the other is a specialist device addressed with a dip switch. When each are connected directly to each other, they work fine. Can ping etc.
 When connected with anything in the middle (router, dumb switch with only those 2 devices) there's nothing. No settings changed etc. 
  
Cable works, been swapped and not the issue. 
 Switch works and is not the issue.
 Used a smart switch and gives no decent data. Although not sure what to look for.
 Previously worked
 No settings have been changed
  
If anyone has any ideas on what's going on, it'd be appreciated!

I have contacted a few users of various technical proficiency to test out the instructions I have written up for them (a lot of older, computer-illiterate folks) and one thing I didn't anticipate (although I should have) is that quite a few folks were hesitant to download the MS Authenticator app, with some even outright refusing. Not everyone has a smart phone issued to them so we are still offering the option to authenticate with SMS. It's not ideal, but better than nothing. 
 Other than reiterating that the app does not collect personal information and does not open your personal device up for FOIA requests, is there anything I can tell people to give them peace of mind when we start migrating entire departments to MFA? I have spoken with department heads and our city manager about the potential for unrest over this, but is it just a case of telling people to suck it up and do it or you won't have access to your account? I want to be as accommodating as possible (within reason) but I don't want to stir the pot and have people think we are putting spyware on their personal phones.
 Anyone dealt with folks like this before?

 im wondering if on juniper this is the best method for bandwidth across the two suites.. we are getting terrible connectivity issues in the new suite with about 300 clients. 10gig fiber is ran from suite to suite.

From looking at the logs, I can see the login attempt from a remote location and a Authenticator MFA notification was approved. The user tells me that they didn't receive or approve any notifications. I tend to believe them since we have the numbers matching and location based settings turned on for Authenticator and I would think they would remember typing in the numbers.
 The strange thing I noticed is that the audit logs show a change in authentication methods at the time of the login. An iPhone was mysteriously added as an authentication method on the account.
 Has anyone seen behavior like this before?
 Update: After reviewing logs it looks like credentials were phished then an MFA approval by the user. I don’t think their lying, they just didn’t even realize they were phished. This created a mess because the attacker sent out 100’s of emails from the account. Thanks for all the info and suggestions that have been mentioned.

 Unsolicited b2b spam (the "I'm circling back at the risk of being a lingering annoyance" messages) really, really frustrate me for a number of reasons, chief among them though:
  
dozens to hundreds a day; and,
 it pisses off employees if/when certain ones make it through routinely (think specific senders or domains) and then I have to hear about it.
  
My solution... every one of these messages I see entering our mail system, I add the sending domain (not the senders address) to an auto-reject list. If they have multiple domains associated with them that I can find, I block those, too.
 The other day I have this b2b rep contact me because they've discovered my game (+1 for your tenacity in actually figuring out what I'm actually doing, but I'm not unblocking your domain), and I get this ugly email about how I'm being unfair, depriving them of income opportunities, yadda, yadda, yadda. 
 So here's the question ... am I actually being unfair? How in the world is anybody supposed to combat the sheer, unrelenting torrent of daily b2b spam? 
 If anybody else has a better or less predictable way of "terminating" these emails, I'm all ears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 ​
 I'm getting the two windows errors 10048 and 10055 on Windows 10 after a short while of runtime indicating that the listening address is already in use or no more sockets are available.
 ​
 I tried the following solution found on the Net: Increasing MaxUserPort under: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
 But that doesn't help.
 ​
 Also listing the opened Ports via netstat -a -b or tcpview.exe and trying to kill suspicious processes does not help. I have killed dozens of processes, but nothing helps and I failed to identify a bad process.
 Also there are not too many open listening sockets less than 50 maybe, so there is no way that the number of allowed sockets is maxed out. But still the system won't allow me to listen to any new socket, or any random port claiming that the address or socket is already in use or no buffer space is available to open any new connections.
 ​
 Only thing that helps is to restart the system and wait for the problem to occur again, which can happen within an hour or maybe work several hours for the error to occur.
 ​
 I'm out of ideas. The system was running fine for months and now this problem is bugging me since a few weeks without finding a solution that avoids a restart.
 Anyone has experience with these errors and has any suggestions beyond what I have already tried and mentioned above?
 The system is an I7 11th gen with 64GB of RAM running updated Windows 10.
 Thanks for the Help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rule 6 / educational post (request).
 I live in Israel.
 Despite the country's reputation as being relatively advanced in technology, fiber optic has only begun getting rolled out here - on a largescale basis - over the past few years. 
 An awful lot of the rest of the network is still connected through vDSL and coaxial.
 I've been trying to make sense of how the various ISPs / infrastructure owners have been laying fiber in my city. 
 It took the best part of two years to finally become available at my building. And when it finally did, it seemed as if every fiber network (there are, I believe, at least 3) was hooked up.
 I know that the internet backbone is built on fiber and that the other inferior forms of connectivity are really used only for last mile stuff to bring internet to consumers.
 I guess what I'm curious to know is what kind of factors make it difficult and time consuming to go from getting fiber from a junction box to the point of being able to finally connect a building and then dwelling units.
 Liaising with other infrastructure providers? Waiting for permits from municipalities to dig up roads to lay cable? Lots of difficult splicing work that has to be carried out in the field?
 How does it happen, exactly, and why does it seem to be a long and cumbersome process?

My boss who has rights in AD, created a user locally, who actually previously worked for our district. so what I’m thinking happened is his local AD account was deleted originally after he left, but his O365 account remained. 
 When he created the local AD account, it created a new user and never synced with the original account? The root of the issue is we use the Company Name field for a dynamic group in Azure for email. 
 However, this users company name is different in AD then it is in Azure (from his previous role). His email and everything loads with no issues with his previous inbox. I thought of using power show and the Set-AzureADUserExtension cmdlet, but it won’t allow me because it’s originated on an on-prem AD. 
 Any ideas?

 I come from BSD world where solution to the problem is rather simple. Socket flag SO_REUSEPORT_LB allows multiple OpenVPN processes to connect to a single socket that performs UDP load balancing.
 Linux only comes with SO_REUSEPORT (without LB part). I had tried to think of a way to run multiple OpenVPN processes and came up with this
  
UDP proxy on a host (ha-proxy/nginx)
 OpenVPN processes in a container behind UDP proxy
 Each container peers with the host and announces its tun* interface (BGP, OSPF whatever. Or even a bunch of static routes on the host)
  
Looks like a lot of overhead. So how do you Linux guys scale OpenVPN?

 In the past I have been using DBAN, but I need to figure out a solution to do batches of 10 or even more HDDs at once. 
 Any ideas what hardware is needed to achieve something like that? 
 The HDDs need to be reused, so it's just destroying the data on the drives that's needed and not the drive itself.

 Any suggestions or experience with such a task is welcome.

 * Easy to deploy and manage * Unattended, low maintenance * 100% cloud based * Cover already installed software, not only new deployments * Focus on low priority apps, like 7zip or web browsers. Business critical software is managed via Intune, will stay this way.
 PDQ Deploy and alike won't really work due to cloud requirement. I also don't want to rely on Intune for every app, updating it manually. I don't have the manpower at the moment. This is a one man department with MSP support. I need this to be smart and automated, while keeping it inhouse within my control. Something I can setup and let it do the work, like with Lenovo Commercial Vantage for firmware and driver updates on our fleet of devices.
 I'm looking into winget right now, specifically this spin on it: Winget AutoUpdate - WAU and I really like it so far, testing in the lab. Of course I know it won't cover 100% of my inventory, but it works really well for what it is. About to launch small pilot with 10 users.
 I'd love to hear about your experiences, some success stories (if any!). Have you tried similar approaches, be it Winget or Chocolatey? Do you maintain your own repos, deploy software this way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have successfully implemented (for the most part it seems) SPF, DKIM and DMARC to help with the spoofing of our domain but it seems that we are still receiving some spoofed mail despite the DMARC policy being set to quarantine.
 I had a look at the mail headers and believe this is due to our mail going out to a signature server, applying a signature and returning before being sent to its intended destination. This is set up in O365 via connectors and has an appropriate SPF record in our DNS.
 Could this be giving a false positive and passing on DMARC? In the header details, Authentication-Results comes back as a spf=pass, dkim=none, dmarc=pass but this is with the IP of our signature server so that is good because we want that to pass. Whereas Authentication-Results-Original returns a failure: spf=fail, dkim=none, dmarc=fail.
 Has anyone experienced this before and do you have any advice in how to combat this? Given that Authentication-Results-Original gives the result I would expect is the signature server causing this issue?

 I was wondering what other people's experiences were with the current Anti Virus solutions? if it was just up to us(at the IT) we would just depend on the tools we have now in defender and such, but thats not going to be good enough with 90 to 100 teachers walking around.
 ​
 some small tidbits of info
 - we currently have about 180 endpoint clients running
 - we are only paying 8 $ per user per year with Kaspersky, which is dirt cheap.
 - we are currently using a google workspace environment but we are planning on migrating to a microsoft azure environment
 - we are located in Europe. I dont think that matters much but I have read some different experiences between certain solutions between regions.

 I'm still new with all the SAML/SSO stuff.
 We have an app that connects to an IdP. The IdP requires the SP Metadata to have an entity ID in URI. Everything works well with this setup. I can see in the AuthnRequest that the Issuer is in URI.
 Now, we've been trying to put AWS Cognito or Auth0 between the web app and the IdP.
 The problem is, the IdP that we're using requires the Entity ID to be URI.
 In AWS Cognito/Auth0, Entity ID is in URN format. 
 I wonder if Cognito/Auth0 is not supported by the IdP. Also, what's the difference between IdP's that require URI and URN for the Entity ID?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently been involved in fitting out a new building with 400 desks and took the leap to using Dell USB-C monitors and daisy chaining display port to a second Dell monitor. We also use Dell Latitude laptops. Initially everything was working great except the cracks began to show quickly. 
 Because the second monitor is daisy chained Windows doesn’t know about it immediately when returning from sleep or hibernate. This means that any windows that were open before sleeping will all move back to the primary monitor. 
 Intermittently when docking, one of the monitors will be blurry. Changing resolution to anything else then changing back to 1080p fixes it. 
 Worst of all, randomly when returning from sleep and logging in, the whole laptop will reboot. We’ve been unable to figure this out and Dell are stumped too. 
 All up this has been a major reputation hit and we’re now having to go back to buying docks and having to mess around with re-cabling all these desks. On paper they were perfect but in practice not so much.

 I work at a small MSP and my boss wants me to put something in place to stop ex-employees accessing company resources. For example our Mailchimp account, [support@company.com](mailto:support@company.com) with a randomly-generated password. An employee leaves and we want to make sure they can't get into this account. Simple enough, change the password.
 What do I do when there's Mailchimp, Unifi, Namecheap, VMware, Cisco, 300 of these accounts? Changing all of these passwords individually when an employee moves on is obviously an option but there has to be a smarter way. For a bigger company with thousands of employees this would be a full time job. How do the big players handle this?

I could use the bandwidth command under the transit interfaces to make R1-R3 interfaces have lower bandwidth OR use the ip ospf cost command under the transit interfaces to make R1-R3 path cost higher. But which one would introduce the least production impact? I believe either would cause OSPF to re-calculate and flood the routing table, right?

I reached out to my AT&T team but I’m impatient and wanted to ask you all about what device would AT&T provide 10G handoff on? In my telco room AT&T operates a Ciena 5140 that trunks to Ciena 3930 switches for a few of our existing circuits. At this point all those circuits are currently 1G but I’ve read that the Ciena does have two 10G SFP ports. Would they be able to provide a 10G SMF handoff with these current 3930 devices?

 I'm totally green when it comes to networking. I went to a site yesterday where they had changed ISP's from Comcast to Ziply Fiber. The Ziply folks installed the demarc box, ran a cable to a RAD ETX-2i-10G and then left without making any other connections. 
 The people at the site had no idea how any of it worked and had no idea where the Comcast cable was coming in their building. I'm pretty sure I traced it to where Comcast comes in the building and goes into a fiber patch panel. 
 Am I able to just unsplice? the Comcast cable out of the patch panel and splice the new Ziply wire in? Or will they have to get a new patch panel to keep their current setup?

 I'm using MetalLB on the k3s cluster for BGP, and FRR service installed on the pfsense router. BGP is working fine, and my BFD profiles are quickly detecting failures. 
 The problem is with ECMP, I was expecting equal load balancing of traffic across all three nodes (with pfsense distributing the traffic with FRR). However, it looks likes its only choosing one "best" route even though it says the other two are multipath...
 ​
 Am I understanding ECMP correctly, or maybe FRR doesn't support round-robin ECMP? But if it doesn't, what's the purpose of any ECMP support?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 tl;dr: How do you provide internet to multiple locations and have it tie into your main network?
 I want to preface by saying that I have very little networking experience. However, the facility I work for no longer has a network administrator so I'm trying to learn some more of how it's setup. 
 Currently, there is one main location, and several satellite locations. From what I understand, the network comes in to the main building, and at some point is literally beamed over to 4 other locations. This is accomplished via emitters and receivers by Ubiquiti. As I've just found out, when one of those receivers goes down, Ubiquiti offers no support to help troubleshoot, or replace if needed. And replacing one involves climbing a long ladder with another ladder to reach the point that the receiver is on, mounting the equipment to the roof at a specific angle, and pointing it at the emitter at a precise point to receive the internet connection. All things that sound really specialized. 
 In any case, previously I worked at a school district. There were 19 locations, and no Ubiquiti or something similar wireless emitters in sight. 
 My question is, is something like this usually done by getting separate Internet connections configured, one for each building, and tying them into the main network? One of the Ubiquiti receivers is several miles away (so I've been told), I'm actually shocked it works at all. It seems like a really odd way to take care of something that seems mostly self explanatory... but I don't really know what I'm talking about.

 To elaborate: For the past week now, maybe a little more, Google thinks my organization's IP range is in France, and not the US. After some testing we came to the conclusion that the problem is with Google.
  
Browsing to Google.com with any browser (we tried several), from within the company network: location shows as France
 Browsing to Google maps automatically opens France
 Location sharing in the browser is disabled company wide - browsers not sending location data
 Tried both Google and Bing; Bing has the right location
 We have our own ASN
 ARIN registration is current and correct
 Searched multiple publicly available geolocation DBs - all show the correct location for our IP range
  
Any advice would be appreciated!
 Or any clue on how to get a hold of the right people at Google. That seems nearly impossible!

 I have been in the technology field for about a decade so not really long I guess. I started in the help desk and I am now a sys admin. I do not do any hiring. In my experience, when I work with a new employee (in the IT dept) and I see them doing the ol chicken pecker method to type out an email, I just feel like I am going to be in for a long day. Maybe its the few people I have worked with. I've seen people at my last job hire someone with "years of experience" just to find out they cant use the home keys. Next thing you know I have to explain a process to them several times. training new people is exhaustive.
 I have been using a mouse / keyboard since I was a kid so I don't expect everyone to be a fast typer but I feel like there is a correlation between keyboard familiarity and knowing your shit.
 Have any of you seen someone break this stigma that I have in my head? are there people out there in senior management positions that actually know what they are talking about and are chicken peckers? or new employees you got in? 
 Edit: a lot of people are taking this personally. I am not saying that I have an HR problem with a slow typer. or I wouldnt give them a chance. I wanted to see if anyone else that has seen someone be bad with a mouse / keyboard but be good as a technician.

I have checked the connection events on the FMC but can’t see the multicast carp traffic(heartbeat). When I make a capture on the firepower I can see the traffic passing through the box as expected. (Source IP Interface of master -> DestIp 224.0.018) Can someone explain why this traffic isn’t logged by the firepower ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm not sure if anyone else can give me a hand. I've started implementing MFA/radius auth across all my switches.
 The 2920's and others it works fine.
 I get to the 5406 and it's not. I'm half wondering if the source ip isn't what I think it is. 
 As the 5406 is a core switch, I don't know where the traffic is coming from.. (I would think that it would come from the IP I manage it from) but the commands primary-vlan and others mentioned in older docs don't exist anymore. I'm running KB.16.03.0006 
 radius-server host x.x.x.x key "******"
 radius-server timeout 15
 radius-server retransmit 2
 aaa authentication login privilege-mode 
 aaa authentication ssh enable radius local
 aaa authentication web enable radius loca
 ​
 At the moment I'm using this, the 5406 has a dozen IP's it could use to do authentications, the radius server requires I specify the IP the radius auth requests are coming from.. (fortinet's fortiauthenticator)
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We (the server/sysadmin team) have been managing SCCM for about 5 years. We use it for reporting, Windows client updates (monthly), some application installs, and other various means. 
 Recently, our Systems Architect has decided the help desk needs to manage Windows updates for the clients, his reasoning? They are workstations, the server team is not responsible for them. Ok, from a high level perspective, I agree. However, the system used to manage those updates is our responsibility. 
 He is really pushing this on the help desk, so I've decided him and I need to have a meeting about this. 
 I find several issues with this line he is trying to draw:
 •The help desk does not currently manage nor know how to use SCCM (I understand this does not mean it isn't their responsibility)
 •The sysadmin team has been managing SCCM for 5 years (this doesn't mean it's our responsibility)
 •None of our roles define SCCM as a responsibility
 Typically, a Desktop Engineer role would buffer this, but we don't have that role.
 So who is responsible? Managing clients is a gray area, some responsibility falls on us, some on the help desk. This all started when I pulled the data on our ~800+ clients running 1909, critically out of date. He said the help desk should have known and been on top of it, and here we are. 
 I have found little to no help desk roles in the industry where SCCM is a requirement, quite the opposite for sysadmin roles. 
 I look forward to and appreciate all your input.
 Edit: Lots of good points about this being an opportunity for the HD folks to grow. The problem is, they don't want to grow, or learn SCCM, or apply for our open sysadmin role. 
 I hope this provides some clarification on that front.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear community,
 I'm in the process of setting up an Azure VPN Gateway S2S connection (route-based IKEv2).
 For best throughput, Microsoft recommends to use GCMAES256 for both IPsec encryption and IPsec Integrity.
 Another supported option would be to use AES256 for IPsec encryption and SHA256 for IPsec integrity.
 I am wondering if there would be any security implications.
 Summarized, these are the configurations that I am considering for the IKEv2:
 configuration 1: GCMAES256:
  
 IKE Phase 1:   
  
 Encryption Integrity/PRF DH Group 
  AES256 SHA384 ECP384 (=DHGroup 20) 
  IKE Phase 2(IPsec):   
  IPsec Encryption IPsec Integrity PFS Group 
  GCMAES256 GCMAES256 ECP384 (=DHGroup 20) 
 
 ​
 configuration 2: AES256+SHA256:
  
 IKE Phase 1   
  
 Encryption Integrity/PRF DH Group 
  AES256 SHA384 ECP384 (=DHGroup 20) 
  IKE Phase 2(IPsec):   
  IPsec Encryption IPsec Integrity PFS Group 
  AES256 SHA256 ECP384 (=DHGroup 20) 
 
 ​
 Since throughput will be better using GCMAES256 for both IPsec encryption and IPsec Integrity, I want to use configuration 1.
 Would there be any reason to prefer configuration 2 over configuration 1 from a security point-of-view ?

 I am fairly new to IT. I am about to finish a 4 year degree (IT) and I have been working the helpdesk / light network admin work for the past year. I also have a few certs, Net+ and AWS CCP. 
 So I can’t say that I haven’t learned anything- I have learned a LOT. But I feel like learning actual in-demand skills at a high level, as well as actually retaining that information, is difficult.
 Recently, I’ve started taking my learning more seriously. Instead of just reading a book or watching a video, I actually break them down and document what I am learning in Notion. But I feel like the things that I am learning aren’t sticking like they do for some of the other senior guys on forums like this.
 How do you guys go about learning and actually retaining the information you learn? I’ve even had the thought that what I am doing now is right, because I am learning how to learn, aka getting better at learning new technologies, which I think is a foundational skill in IT.
 TLDR; How do you learn and retain knowledge specific to IT?

 We have been piloting it here since preview with a few of our staff, it works great. Its just trying now to figure out how to turn this on and then begin full migration over to it from those that are using the less secure methods (SIM Swap/etc).

 I currently bring the copper handoff from the ISP to a VLAN on a switch in my environment, and from there back out to each firewall.
 What does everyone consider 'best practice' from a security standpoint?
 Would it be better to add a 'dirty switch' outside of the environment in between the ISP and the firewall(s)? Or is this just another failure point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys
 Tbh, not sure if this is a Windows or Networking question .. but here goes.
 TL;DR - Is it normal for a DHCP server to show ~150 Request/Ack entries for a given PC for a given day?
 .
 On my workplace I'm investigating some logs from a specific PC, where I need to crossreference the timestamps with the DHCP server's communication with said PC.
 The PC was on-prem on the day in question, talking directly with the company DHCP server (although there might have been a firewall in between the LAN networks).
 When I ask my colleague to pull the DHCP logs (from Logpoint) for one 24-hour period, I get somewhere close to 150 DHCP entries in the log, with a ca. 50/50 distribution of DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK (status: RENEW).
 The initial DORA process on the PC's boot looks fine - it's all the entries after that which puzzle me. The PC retains the same IP address all day.
 Lease time is 4 hours, I'm told (can't confirm on my own PC, working from home right now).
 .
 My first thought is that the user closes the lid many times during the day, and the PC will negotiate a renew on the lease when it wakes again. However, my colleagues insist that the PC should retain its IP when going to sleep (not hibernate). My Google skills fall short when trying to confirm this.
 But even if the PC renegotiates every time - it would mean that the user closes their lid every 10 minutes or so during an entire day, and opens it immediately afterwards. This seems extremely unlikely.
 I've asked the DHCP guys at work about this, but they're out of office these days, so I'm trying here meanwhile.
 Does anyone have an input as to why the Logpoint logs show ~150 DHCP entries for a single PC during one work day (assuming normal user behaviour)?

 Other posts with comments where some say never to install it on a DC, some say its fine/doesnt matter as long as you configure it correctly. And documentation says install it on a mgmt computer and then the GPO extension says to typically where you edit GPOs which would be on a DC.
 I want to use LAPS only for clients. And setting the GPO to apply only on clients OU.
 Installing LAPS MGMT tool on a DC shouldnt be any problems right? As long as I dont set the LAPS settings GPO to apply for the DC.
 Thanks!

 Often times the translations are jsut ridicolous, you better know if they like \ or / to seperate directories (there are generally no examples or guidance given near or above fields), you have to tick a box to enter a host-name instead of an ip adress (i guess a regex check was too hard for them to code), there is no search option despite the massive number of settings and submenus and it's just on the slow side, i could go on...
 Am I just stupid? How do you feel about Konica Minolta's web interface?

 So there was a dude who was the architect for one of our environments, probably built it all and did most of the BAU work on it as far as i can tell for several years.
 This guy has now gone to another job somewhere in security in the same business and handed over BAU support to us. This environment is ancient, all running on EoL hardware, out of support operating systems, lights up like a Christmas tree on pen-test reports that we've been trying to address for six months now...although at this stage it would be easier to just turn the whole lot off, politically that's not really possible. 
 Out of all the business guess who is most up our arse about fixing the absolute fuck load of problems with this environment? Yep, the guy that has looked after it for twelve fucking years and addressed absolutely none of the problems.
 I've never wanted to punch someone through a monitor so much in my career.

I'll be honest that part of it is on me: in the past year, I've lost a brother, been hospitalized twice, had my wife hospitalized, father with a quad-bypass, mother very recently with a stint replacement, and a minor family member we've had to coach through some life-altering nonsense that I'd rather not repeat. So, yeah, I've been a little out-of-pocket this year, and that's on me. 
 I got this guy not only his job, but his position, then he did an end-run around me with an outgoing C-level exec to get team lead, and due to a manpower shortage at the time, fell into management. I was honestly okay with all of that, because I knew the guy was A-list material; I wouldn't have gone to bat for him otherwise. Also, fuck management... in 25 years of this, I've never wanted to be one, so more power to those who do. 
 So, here I am... trying my best to be cordial with a guy who has from day one of having access to payroll been upset that I make more than him, while he's talking to me like the goddamned godfather, filling a position I had the opportunity to leave at least five times, now trying to get out-from-under before I get fired or PIP'd into a corner, all while trying not to be the asshole who fracks off without leaving documentation. 
 Sigh... I was honestly hoping to be able to retire at this one. Ten years with an employer is a pretty good stint, in my book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last week, there's been 4 major attacks affecting certain social agencies and NGO's, i've been curiosly following these stories and one culprit that keeps popping up is 'MFA Fatigue' , in an attempt to secure our infrastructure or reduce chances of falling prey to some of these attacks, i've been implementing a handful of measures/policies, most of which i actually learnt from here through various posts and responses.
 In the wake of this, i have a few questions or concerns that i'm hoping to get some feedback on how you all handle this in your organizations.
  
how do you deal with MFA fatigue? by preventing MFA from prompting via push notification but rather require the user open the App and fill in the code? this way if you aren't logging in anywhere, you won't have the need to open the app?
 how do you also handle Atypical travel? blocking IP or setting strict account lockout threshold?
 is SSPR adviceable? or does it grant an attacker an added option to gain full control?
  
I already did research most this via google and Microsoft learn...so as the attackers. i was just wondering if there are any other methods apart from the obvious of dealing with these attacks.
 ​
 thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. Our offices are connected via IPsec tunnels but there is one specific tunnel that drops relatively frequently. The tunnel connects our US and China offices. Trouble is, I've never been able to explain why. To get it back I usually have to failover to our backup ISP in the US office (and fail back to the primary again) and it will come back up.
 There are other occasions when the tunnel from China to our other offices (also in Asia) fails so the common theme is China. What's the likely reason? Could it just be the great FW in China having an impact? We use Check Point firewalls - happy to learn something new!

 I want to force MFA on RDP connections, but everything i can find relates to RDP gateway config. 
 I could set this up, but wouldnt a user in the office just be able to RDP straight over and bypass the gateway?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning
 I've been a bit of an idiot and i didnt realize that Windows 10 had version 22H2. I assumed that was Windows 11 and onwards. My site of around 300 machines are all running 21H2 so from my understanding i can upgrade via the enablement package. 21H2 have support until the middle of next year so no immediate rush.
 I want to push this out to a few machines to test, i use WSUS and client side targetting so applying this to individual machines can be a pain as i would have to setup a new GPO to target a new client side group.
 I was wondering if its possible to get hold of the files and push it out via PDQ instead? I notice it says they are not available from the Windows Update catalogue though.
 Has anyone else used the enablement package outside of WSUS some how and managed to upgrade machines?
 Appreciate any advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning/ day/ evening, good Sirs!
 Quite a few months ago (Or maybe even last year), we had a case of Conficker on one of our client's DCs. Back then, I thought I completely removed the thing, since it was coming from an old XP machine, made it's way to the DC and didn't really do anything else, since it was so effing old. I used ZenMap, to, supposedly, find all remains and remove them, but now I've gotten a notice, that the disk-space for C:\ is getting low. I checked to find Sophos Endpoint Agent creating snapshot files by the hour, because it kept finding and deleting the same file in Sys32, that is being generated by some mysterious Conficker Virus remains. 
 I checked online, but didn't get any real results, just some general tips, on how to remove Conficker. Now, I'm not really experienced, when it comes to malware and viruses, so I don't know, where to start, that's why I'm turning to your expertise again. If you need more info, please go ahead and ask, and I'll provide any necessary info.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I work for an employer with a number of different sites. The organization's main office is moving from one location with multiple one-story buildings to a seven-story office building over the next year or two. Until now, our scheme for data has mostly followed 10.111.X.Y, with X being an arbitrary VLAN ID associated with a specific department and Y being the host. VoIP has typically mirrored that but with a VLAN ID equal to X + 100 (i.e. VLAN 50's voice VLAN is 150), and wireless has been a single VLAN across the entire organization. 
 At our new building, we are tentatively planning on sticking with 10.111.X.Y, but with X being an arbitrary VLAN associated with the floor, not the department. The idea is to hopefully simplify management on our end since there will be multiple departments per floor but only one switch stack. We're planning on the same voice VLAN scheme. We're undecided on whether to do a single wireless subnet or one per floor. We're also considering adding another VLAN schema (like X + 200) for various maintenance devices on each floor of the new building, like cameras, HVAC equipment, etc.
 Does this all make sense? Is there a more efficient way of doing this? What's worked in your experience? We don't have too large a number of end users or devices, but we figure if there was ever a time to adjust our addressing it would be now. As a side note, what is standard practice for VPN pools? Right now we are using a completely random range (10.100.20.x). Would it make more sense to use something in the 10.111.x range? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in a few different positions at some level of Sysadmin/Systems Engineer for the past 10 years or so, have a 4 year degree in IT. I have worked in an array of different industries, most notably finance, manufacturing, and media.
 My previous position had me in DevOps engineering where I was able to master Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, and Infrastructure-as-code best practices. Unfortunately due to various reasons I reached that "burn-out" point where I was underpaid and overwhelmed with the work being requested of me, so I found a new position earlier this year, working in media.
 A few months in, the transition between the two environments has been, well.. extreme.
 Pros: Finally getting paid what I'm worth, in an industry more to my liking, with less responsibility!
 Cons: Mostly Windows environment (few hundred servers, mostly bare-metal), no documentation aside from a handful of spreadsheets, inconsistent communication within the department, no one's even heard of a code repository before, management is very resistant to change. 
 I'm someone who's done all the DevOps things and enjoys doing them when the workloads are reasonable. This is the path I want to grow in as (from what I can tell) the world is moving more towards microservice/IaaS models. 
 Am I in the right for wanting to gracefully push the place more towards modern standards? or should I just accept that this is the culture in the new industry and maybe this position isn't a good fit after all?

 Initially all replication are doing well. 
 Recently start popping error of sysvol failed to replicate followed by AD changes not showing on PDC despite DFS, repadmin, dcdiag and dfsdiag not showing any error at all. 
 Currently clueless on what to do. 
 PDC is hosted on AWS. Built fron scratch on Server 2019.
 Member server are Server 2016 which u will call SDC1 & SDC2
 Additional info.
 Sync between SDC1 and SDC2 are doing fine.
 Tried performing repadmin /syncall /AdeP and replicate from option in ADSS on PDC but still not showing latest changes (new computer object and user creation)
 UPDATE 1: If i perform repadmin /syncall on PDC it goes straight to syncall finished without showing the usual replication is in progress information.
 Update 2: will temporary put it as solved. As i realize its Inter-Site and not Intra-Site hence the default replication timing is 3 hours. But will keep a look out if problem still shows will do a ADFS restore.

 The issue is that I cannot edit a field when using a lookup value. So basically the computer name is in a list as a lookup field and I need to edit the return date.
 Everytime I try and work the script it tells me the system object cannot be converted to the pnp-pipeline. I will edit and post the code tomorrow but I'm hoping this I'd enough to jog someone's brain so I can try in the AM. Thank you.

 Network Engineer for Municipal ISP. We currently have a /23 and /22 from ARIN. I'm planning for when we need more addresses. There are several options and I'd like to ask your opinion to see what your experiences have been.
 We could go down the road of CGNAT. Very expensive and we are a small shop with no experience with this technology.
 NAT6to4 seems easy enough to configure, but I worry about to scalability and robustness.
 We also have the option to lease additional /20 IP space for ~ 0.20c and IP per year with a 5 year term. Cheap, but not a long term solution.
 Then there is the option of getting IPv6 space form ARIN and using IPv6 exclusively. Without complete internet adoption of IPv6 I worry about routing and reachability issues to organizations that aren't at least dual stacked.
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All this talk about how the November CU update was breaking domain authentication in environments where RC4 was explicitly disabled via group policy sent me down a rabbit hole.
 My environment wasn't affected, but it made me curious about WHY so many have disabled RC4. TLDR; it's less secure than AES256.
 Step 1) audit your domain controllers for RC4 in use. Just replace DC01 with the name of your domain controller. 0x17 events means RC4 is being used.
 Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Security' -ComputerName 'DC01' -FilterXPath "*[System[EventID=4769] and EventData[Data[@Name='TicketEncryptionType']='0x17']]" 
 What this uncovered is that Azure AD Connect for hybrid environments was using RC4 (it creates a computer object called AZUREADASSOACC). I guess the reason for this was that until sometime in 2020 AES wasn't supported?? So if you use Azure AD Connect, you might want to look into this to improve security.
 Anyway, this article nicely outlines the steps needed to get Azure AD Connect using AES https://azuregeek.io/en/secure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac/?q=%2Fen%2Fsecure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac%2F
 After following these steps & rolling over my Kerberos decryption keys I now see Azure AD SSO now using AES (0x12 in the event log)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just ran into WU failing to install some updates with 0x800f0922 error code.
 Googled it and these failures are fairly common, but the "solutions" are all over the place. The most common one is to disable secure boot in the BIOS. Another one from this thread is to enable AppReadiness service. Plus the regular assortment of "sfc /scannow" and "dism /restorehealth" voodoo, and all the way up to updating BIOS and what not.
 The PSA is this - all of this is nonsensical. 0x800f0922 is a generic error meaning "the installer failed".
 To understand the cause you need to skim though %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log and find the first error that then triggers a cascade of failures culminating in 0x800f0922.
 In our case it was that ... drumroll ... %System32%\Macromed\Flash directory was missing. Created it, re-run updates - et voila - all updates went through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an HP L3 switch connected to a Cisco L3 switch and am in the process of migrating SVIs. They are connected via 2x10G links in an LACP port-channel. This trunk carries a number of VLANs. There are devices hanging off of the Cisco switch with the HP core still handling the routing, and that all works fine.
 I created a test VLAN on each switch and added it to the trunk on both ends, with the intention of testing the SVI on the Cisco switch and only L2 on the HP side. I don't know if it's coincidence that this is happening with the test VLAN, but I can't get the test VLAN to pass any traffic across the trunk. Devices connected to the Cisco switch can talk to the SVI, but anything on the other side of the trunk can't connect. I've done variations of testing and essentially, any devices on that test VLAN can talk to each other unless they are physically located on the other side of the trunk. I've moved the SVI to the HP side and anything on HP side is now able to talk to the SVI and anything on Cisco can no longer talk to it.
 If I run a packet capture on a device from either side, it sends ARPs and gets no replies, furthering my suspicion that this is just a L2 trunk issue.
 I suspect there is some sort of bug with this VLAN not getting passed because I added it later than other VLANs. I plan to shut and no shut the port on the Cisco switch during a window. I have encountered something similar when using VTP in the past.
 Just wondering if I'm missing something - this seems fairly basic so I'm astounded it's causing such an issue.
 EDIT: No VTP in use. The Cisco switch is a pair of stacked 9500s, and the trunk port is cross-chassis etherchannel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to design a network for a tether to a vehicle. The original plan was to have a tether cable with two single mode fiber cables and have the cables running in full-duplex which is something I have done before. The network is very simple as in the image.
 The problem now is that due to supply issues is that we can only source a tether with a single fiber single mode. I have not set up a network like this before. Is it possible to still set up the same design using half-duplex mode. I have the following questions:
  
What type of media converter do I need to look for? The one I was going to use was https://www.mpl.ch/t2875.html since it needs to be small to fit the vehicle. But I am guessing the 100Base-FX or 1000Base-X are not compatible with half-duplex.
 What type of transceiver/connector would be best to use since I can no longer just use the LC Duplex connector?
 Are there any special considerations for the router/switch that I need to use to support half-duplex the original plan was to use a tiny unmanaged switch. But not I am not so sure that is possible https://botblox.io/products/gigablox-small-gigabit-switch
  
Is my idea still possible or do I need to abandon it now?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed while building out some ansible automation that some of the modules take a very long time to complete runs. The main issue here is that it is slowing down the control plane and affecting some SNMP alerting. The main culprit here is the "no shut" command or rather enabling/disabling ports. 
 I've tried using the ansible module only for enabling ports, as a shutdown command is visible in the configuration and does not run. Templates for the rest of the configurations.
 I've tried using a template to speed up runs, which does help a bit, but still requires applying no shutdown to all ports in a switch stack. This takes a significant amount of time.
 ​
 Has anyone run into this type of problem with automating switch configurations? Should I look at another feature within ansible or perhaps use a separate tool to manage port status (maybe pulling facts? Or using napalm? Direct API commands?) ? I haven't seen anything that will allow the no shutdown command to be present in the configuration, but it would be a nice to have feature.

 I personally needed this for recording a screencast of the process to install Corso. While recording myself going through permission settings in M365, I didn’t want to unintentionally reveal PII for my team members or other sensitive data.
 Another reason to do this is if you’re looking to level up both your skills and want to experiment with being the admin in your own space rather than impacting other users on a production domain. It’s also a good step to experiment with owning your own identity.

Essentially, barracuda has an internal list of senders and IPs it marks as -1000 and does not apply filtering to normally. This is obviously a problem, but if this list was EXTREMELY well curated, it would probably be fine. However, it is not. It whitelists all salesforce IPs for example, even if it's a newly set up gmail etc. There are a lot of ways to exploit this list that I've observed since reporting the issue and just two weeks ago we had something very malicious make it through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm working with a company with several small branch offices. They have older Junipers that work as their gateway/firewall/edge router and VPN gateway. I'm trying to swap out these all-in-one appliances slowly, but it doesn't seem like any new VPNs want to connect to the older Junipers. Any advice? It's a hub-and-spoke setup.
 I'm thinking that the best way to proceed is to start in their central office by connecting a new appliance to the old, passing it a single public IP (1to1) at first, then slowly moving over other IPs, the branch VPNs, and services as time and budget permits. Eventually, the new appliance would be doing all the work. At that point, remove the old appliance and plug the new one directly into the ISP's modem. 
 Is there a more common way to work through this scenario? Are there any gotchas? The project is not a rush and I assume it'll take a couple of months to complete. If we were just talking about a few offices, I'd get everything provisioned, take them down on a Friday evening, and be done by the following Monday, but there are just too many branches to coordinate that over a single weekend. Thoughts?

 Our main requirements are that it supports 464XLAT (specifically CLAT), tr-069 and has WiFi 5 minimum. If they are mesh devices great. It’s not a disaster if they aren’t. 
 I’ve spoken to Draytek, they have confirmed to me that they don’t support and are not looking to support 464. We are currently using some TP-link mesh boxes for lab testing though they don’t support 464 either though they are being cagey with me in regards to their roadmap. 
 Budgets are a bit above my pay grade, this is just POC work at the moment. 
 I know that OpenWRT supports it. But that brings a host of issues that I’d rather not have to deal with in a prod environment.

 My question though is about Cisco Anyconnect. Usually we add the url that the VPN connects to but yesterday I ran into an issue. The person who was trying to connect, their any connect box on their screen just had a name of the server they were connecting to, not an IP or url.
 What would be the best way then to find the IP or URL in this case? When we went to the any connect settings , they were all blank because he was not connected.
 Our way of getting it to work was his wife, who was working remotely and also on the same VPN, sent a screen shot of her settings and from there we were able to get the server IP.
 But I am just curious what would have been the best way to find the IP or URL? Is there a file I can look at on the users PC? Like I said, when we went to his any connect settings, they were all blank beacuse he was not connected.

It should be pretty predictable, especially when ASICs are involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So, long story short, we had an ask from our company to take our external contractor AD Users and run Enable-RemoteMailbox on them. We quickly found out that was not what should have been done and they should have had the command, Enable-MailUser run on them as they are external contractors and we simply want to have them as AD Users that have an external email address that mail is resolved to.
 Okay, simple enough I thought. So, I went ahead and ran the following for each user that was affected:
 Disable-RemoteMailbox -Identity <users> -Confirm:$false
 Enable-MailUser -Identity <user> -ExternalEmailAddress <[user@theircompany.com](mailto:user@theircompany.com)>
 We also wanted their Email field in the General tab of AD to match their UPN, so after running the above commands, AND before AAD sync happened (unfortunately) we updated their Email field to match that of their UPN. When we run the Enable-MailUser is makes their Email property their external email address. Well, that appears to have messed up those users where now On-prem they are showing as MailUsers, but in 365 they are showing still as a UserMailbox for RecipientType.
 We are struggling to get this update on both ends. So far, I have tried taking one of the users and running Disable-MailUser, letting that sync over to 365 and then running Enable-MailUser again. No luck. I have tried having the user set up as a MailUser On-prem and then stop syncing them with 365. Once they are no longer synced, I then re-sync them, but again, no luck.
 What's even stranger is we noticed that when we disable them On-prem as a MailUser, and then re-sync them, one property keeps getting written back it would seem from 365 to On-prem...
 Within the user's proxyAddresses, one address shows up. The x500? I'm wondering if I am missing a step here or if something else needs to be updated for these users to finally sync up as a MailUser On-prem as well as in 365? Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently went from an on-prem Exchange server to Microsoft 365. We still have On-Prem AD using AAD Connect to sync with 365. PC's are a mix of Windows 10/11, all installed with Office 365. Whenever we have a new user logon, the system tries to load Outlook 2016 and connect to our old Exchange server (FYI, this is no longer turned on) My question is how does Windows try and load the 2016 version of something that isn't installed and what setting do I need to turn off to stop it trying to connect to old Exchange?
 All our DNS records are correct and pointing to 365. In the interim of swapping systems we had to have an Autodiscover GPO which is now deleted.
 Any help appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've inherited an AD with company.com as internal AD domain as well es external domain name. Right now the external records (e.g. www.company.com) are just placed inside the default "company.com" zone inside the AD DNS.
 Is there currently any Best Practise way to keep external records automatically up2date inside the AD zone?
 There might be some way to automate this with powershell (lookup external records and set internal records accordingly) but this feels a bit too hacky.
 Best case would be to tell AD to lookup the records on the external DNS if the internal DNS does not have any records. As far as I understand by default AD doesn't forward those requests since only the internal DNS is authoritative for "company.com"?
 It's probably not as simple as adding the external name server to "Properties -> Nameserver" on the AD I guess?
 Is there any way around this problem or do you just have to live with manually maintaining those external records on the internal DNS?
 I've also seen you can do zone transfers from AD to a specific server. Could you instead do a zone transfer from external to internal? (Without it overwriting all the internal records)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auditing Teams membership changes can help admins ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. By regularly auditing membership changes, organizations can identify and address any potential security risks.
 Since Audit log search has limited customization, I have written a PowerShell script to track Teams membership changes with advanced capabilities.
 You can download the script from GitHub.
 Script Highlights:
  
The script uses modern authentication to retrieve audit logs.
 Exports all the teams’ membership changes
 The script has a filter to track private channel membership changes separately.
 It has a filter to monitor shared channel membership changes separately.
 Allows you to generate an audit report for a custom period.
 It can be executed with an MFA enabled account too.
 Exports report results to CSV file.
 Automatically installs the EXO V2 module (if not installed already) upon your confirmation.
 The script is scheduler-friendly. I.e., Credentials can be passed as a parameter instead of saved inside the script.
  
If you have any suggestion or additional requirements, I will update them in the next version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, there are a few posts on the web regarding this question, but all of them are 5+ years old without any usable solution...
 To keep it short- We have Active Directory in our company, with 300+ machines, of which ~50 are laptops.
 We have bad practices in the company - most of the laptop users don't bring laptops to the company (thus not connecting to the company LAN, not updating group policy, and some custom software) for long periods of time.
 The general idea is to FORCE them to bring laptops to the company once in a while (every 15-20 days) by automatically expiring their cached domain credentials after X days or X logins. Since M$ till this day doesn't offer any option to achieve this, I am wondering if maybe somebody had a similar situation and if there maybe is some workaround to achieve this?
 We have VPN (Checkpoint), but also can't force users to use it (also no option to keep it constantly connected- which by itself is also bad idea because there would be a lot of incoming traffic on servers).

If I used trusted updated software, don't download and run anything shady, how does my system get infected then? Can my browser security just get bypasses or what?

I'm really happy about this, considering that I fell in love with it. Recently, we had some internal "problems" with the cybersec team (which is not in the IT dept anymore), and the question of the day is "who should do what?" Now that a lot of stuff has been migrated in the Purview portal, I think it's harder to identify who should have access to it and, in particular, define all the permissions. I think both the exchange admin and the security admin should have access to the portal, and it's mandatory that both the part talks before making any changes. What do you think/how do you handle this in your company?

 Hi, looking for a little advice. I'm wondering on the best path to go down with this..
 I have a new client who is still running SBS 2011 (I know, I know..), thankfully Exchange has been decommissioned and they are on 365 for mail. So it's basically just an old file server which needs to be replaced at some stage with something modern.
 However they still use the Remote Desktop facility built into SBS2011. They would like to keep this if possible or some new variation of it. Is it still supported in newer versions of Windows Server?
 Thanks for any advice

 I saw a reddit topic and and question topic to microsoft with same problem. But there is no solution.
 Only fix 
  
close outlook
 disable other network adapters
 open again outlook (outlook connects)
 enable network adapters again
  
Is there anyone who faced this problem and found solution.

 I am currently trying to implement a MFA Solution for the company I work with. While Fido2 works just fine on a Desktop Enviroment to secure the M365 access it's utterly useless when the User has to work on a Terminal Server, because the Server does (for whatever reason) not recognise the Key so the User can't login into their M365 while working on the Terminal Server.
 And sadly mandating the Authenticator App on the private phone of an employee is not possible (legally), so I am looking for a solution that works on Terminal Servers to secure the M365 access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My environment either needs a local repo or just to proxy the apt packages. The main repo server will be the only one able to go out to the web, everything else has to point at it for their packages/updates.
 100% ubuntu environment with server and desktop
 I've played with aptly in the past but the process of having to do the mirrors/snapshots and publishing and everything can be a bit of a hassle to update the repos often. Not major gripe but it's just something.
 Apt-cacher-ng as a proxy seems promising as well. Haven't used it but pretty straight forward.
 Would it be better to just utilize the proxy instead of storing an entire mirror of all ubuntu repos locally? I feel it would be, since that would be a huge waste of space if we only use maybe 20% of the actual packages in the repo. Not going to waste time figuring out exactly what packages each system uses but if we utilize the proxy then it can cache what's needed and other systems can just grab from there if it's cached and cut down on network traffic going out.
 One main concern is being able to freeze the updates/packages so that we can update our test string, verify it works and then update the prod string with the same package versions and everything.
 Obvious workaround is just to take note of package version #s when we do the update to test string but while doable that would be annoying for some of the admins i'm sure and I want this as simple as possible.
 Is there a way to set apt-cacher-ng to have 2 cache directories?

I know the exam was changed recently for core 1 & 2 and wanted to see what people had used in the past to help study. I have found many Udemy courses and books, but am not sure what will be the most beneficial. I use computers frequently, but do not have a degree or experience working in IT.

 MonitUp, measures the productivity of employees and freelancers with employee monitoring.

 They did a firewall update Sunday night and I noticed the problem Monday morning. It took them until Monday noon to resolve this, the website failed to work properly. This is unacceptable. Losing customers for a SaaS product :(
 Which hosting are you using? Who in the world does this job best? Uninterrupted service and fast support in case of a problem are important.
 I don't believe in the "best hostings of 2022" articles, the best ones usually depend on how much you pay the company that wrote that article :)

It runs into issues: slow transfer rate (it takes 3+ hours to finish, sometimes it’ll fail when it’s almost done. My shift would be over before I find out that the image failed so troubleshooting is very tedious!
 Anyway, any imaging/switching experts can offer any advice? I think this is a job for multicast but I’m not too familiar. We use Aruba 6300 switches. The vlan they’re using has igmp snooping and pim-sparse configured. If there’s a quick and dirty fix I’ll take it! If there’s something in the ghost software I need to tweak I’m all for it! Anything to avoid using a clean switch and cabling everything to it (that’s their idea btw)

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

This is a medium sized logistics/shipping business. They mainly have a small team of sys admins and helpdesk guys with no real networking guys. I'd be working with one other network guy who is more junior (guy just got his CCNA)
 Small offices and locations peppered around the US. Fortinet, Sonicwall, Meraki, Dell storage, Meraki/Fortinet wireless, with Microsoft Hyper V. Not too terribly complicated from what I can tell.
 They don't have any monitoring AFAIK, so I'll be helping them build out that infrastructure there.
 Given this context, what are some of your tips/questions to ask to acclimate yourself to a new environment? Any favorite documentation tools? Personal recommendations for log aggregation solutions?

 So I have been working for a company as a Help Desk Analyst i went in as a contractor and most recently i have been made full time my manager put me on a slack call with him and he told me the news 
 Before all this happened he knew for a while that i want to be a system administrator it has been my dream job he asked our director who runs the system administration team and he told my manager to tell me that he is not looking for anyone new at the moment 
 after he told me that he went on to say that I will be training you once a week and i told him that is very generous of you because he has a very busy schedule my manager is our service desk manager and he also does system administration
 I just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens to me because my manager went on to tell me that if my director does need a system administrator it won’t be for 2 to 3 years obviously he is just guessing and doesn’t know for sure. 
 I am really appreciative of the fact my manager is gonna trian me and i will get to learn and leverage my skills but i am young i don’t want to be in help desk for another second and i definitely do not want to wait 2 to 3 years to become system administrator 
 I am sorry for the long speech i just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens after? 
 also my manager told me “don’t worry you definitely will not stay in help desk” he tells me i am very ambitious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Would love thoughts/opinions on the best devices or type of devices or service. I have recently started at a small but growing enterprise. Company has 4 locations in the US and 3 in Asia. 3 locations have 200-300 users each and the rest are tiny. One of the larger sites hosts a single public facing application, accessed by our partners, nothing else is hosted publicly in the enterprise services (with the exception of client VPN). The rest have users mostly accessing Office 365, other SaaS applications and a smattering of internal applications. So far the long term goals of the company are:
  
To ideally consolidate all sites on a single platform - not a hard requirement if something else makes sense but right now it's a hodge podge and current gear is up for renewal and/or end of life. Everything is basic firewalls right now, no NGFW/UTM/SWG etc.
 To implement a greater degree of filtering/inspection/prevention/reporting and to ultimately integrate with an EDR/XDR platform for better visibility.
 To ideally eliminate our MPLS in favor of an SD-WAN, with redundant ISP's in each location
 To move all server workloads, including the single public facing app, to public cloud
  
The security vendor who my boss (CIO) has a relationship with is pushing him to buy their EDR/XDR platform along with their UTM's in every location. This is running a pretty high price tag and causing him to think about whether he can afford two for every location to have redundancy/fail over. I have a good networking foundation but my background is more on the server and storage side. At this point I am thinking that these UTM's at each location may be overkill for users surfing the internet. I am thinking there might be better/more cost effective alternatives. Or whether a hosted solution like zScaler or a competitor would be more cost effective. Ideally whatever solution we choose should have some way to integrate with an XDR platform.
 WWYD?
 thanks

 So Rackspace screwed up bigly and took down e-mail for over a week (ongoing). We've migrated all of our users to Office 365 and are currently using the Admin Center. 
 We want to totally disassociate from Rackspace completely-- but all the Office 365 Suite licenses are held there. We plan on purchasing them directly through O365 admin center--- but my main question is:
 Would we have to uninstall and re-install Office 365, or are we good as it stands?

 I am a lab equipment technician, and ran into a configuration I was unfamiliar with today and was wondering if some here might be able to help me understand a bit better. My networking knowledge is probably about a 4 out of 10. 
 We have an analyzer that processes patient samples and sends that data to an information management system. Normally its all TCP/IP, which allows me to easily switch the analyzer between communicating with a production server and a test server by switching the IP and PORT (which are both static). However I ran into one today that was configured with an ethernet to RS232 adapter. 
 Basically, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC) > Lantronix Box > Management System. 
 Parallel to that, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC)>Firewall>client network>analyzer diagnostic report exports to a website I can access from home. 
 I was just wondering what the purpose of running a seperate RS232/TCP/IP converter to the management system would be, if the analyzer and management system could be ran all via TCP/IP (which is what I normally see). 
 I tried to keep it concise without being too vague, but if there are more details I should include please let me know. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a link to the original.
 So I set up a meeting with my boss and I fumbled through a shitty 2 weeks notice. I told him I’m leaving. I didn’t want to hurt the guys feelings so I told him I need to be remote to be able to support my family more which is true but mainly I was sick of the constant lack of support while being handed project after project while trying to be an entire IT department for a large organization. 
 I kid you not I got the 5 stages of grief from him.
 In no particular order:
 Denial- what do you mean? Your not putting in your 2 weeks notice are you?
 Anger- There is no way I am going to be able to replace you by the deadline! Who gave you an offer? How much?
 Bargaining- Would you stay if gave you 5 grand? Can you please stay until march, I’ll let you work from home! We can work with you. Please let me work with you!
 Depression- I thought we were friends. I can take care of you. Give me a chance please! 
 Acceptance- you’ll want to hand in a formal notice of resignation if this is what you really want. 
 I didn’t want to tell him I accept an offer anywhere else but he kept patronizing me by telling me that money is gonna be tight and shit so i finally told him I got an offer somewhere else that gives me more freedom. He kept fucking grilling me to give him a chance to do good by me but it just felt weird. I told him I’d sleep on it cause I felt bad but I told him not to expect me to change my mind. Now he’s fucking texting me outside of work saying he spoke with the ceo so they can “make it work” for me to work remotely most of the time.
 TLDR; Gave 2 weeks notice and tried to be nice by focusing on a personal priority of mine instead of telling my boss what i really think and it back fired. 
 I’m handing in a formal resignation tomorrow hopefully it’s all just acceptance from there out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings. I'm struggling with creating an IPSEC connection between colocated server running Debian 11 and KVM/QEMU.
 It seems there's something "mysterious" about the virbr0 interface. I have a tunnel created using Strongswan IPSEC but it really only works in one direction. It acts like a firewall issue, but I've tried many things that make me believe it's more of a fundamental limitation of QEMU/Libvirt/virbr0.
 I've have created several tunnels with Strongswan, but this roadblock has me stumped.
 Has anyone successfully created an IPSEC tunnel with KVM host using strongswan and the default virbr0 network? I'd like to have my VMs reachable over the IPSEC tunnel and also allow the VMs to reach my local LAN.
 I can reach the VMs without issue, but I can't connect from the VM to my local LAN. I noticed the issue when trying to connect two KVM hypervisors over the internet with Strongswan IPSEC. I've been running Strongswan to connect to my VMs in the cloud for over a year, but never realized the tunnel really doesn't work in the other direction (other than ping/ICMP works).
 The basic oddity is like this: I can ping a remote LAN host over the tunnel, but if I run traceroute, it tries to go to the public interface first, which leads me to believe it's a limitation of virbr0.
 If anyone would like to help, here are my iptables on the kvm host.
 Local LAN = 192.168.7.0.24
 Remote virbr0/KVM LAN = 192.168.222.0/24
 Here's the strongswan config.
 I think the workaround is to create a tunnel using Wireguard, but I hate being defeated and would really like to learn what I'm doing wrong or not understanding.
 Thanks in advance to anyone willing to contribute.

        <updated>2022-12-13T00:23:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, the heading is the TL;DR.
 I recently purchased a SonicWall TZ270 for the family business as there was no sort of security infrastructure before. This is replacing what was just a basic home router.
 Ever since the firewall was implemented, there has been intermittent internet connectivity happening roughly 3x an hour lasting from 10 seconds-2 minutes. edit: closer to 5 minutes.
 ​
 Here is the current configuration:
 X0 - LAN 192.168.0.x
 X1 - WAN
 X3 - DEV 192.168.7.x
 X4 - SRV 192.168.5.x
 DHCP and DNS are on a Windows Server on the SRV network with IP Helper on the SonicWall. No issues with either of those.
 Ports are open for 2 services on 2 different servers - configured with wizard.
 ​
 Diagnosing:
 - Confirmed there are no duplicate DHCP or DNS servers
 - Disabled failover probing (known SW issue)
 - Ran packet traces
 - Pinged internal IP's, external IP's, internal hostnames, external hostnames for info
 - Reset to factory defaults, reconfigured as bare-metal as possible
 ​
 It looks like when the internet connectivity drops, I lose access to the WAN, both hostnames and IP's, but not anything on the internal network. I managed to catch the drop on 1 packet trace on the firewall and it dropped nearly 400 packets in a split second, all blaming either multicast not being configured, or something on the wrong subnet (known issue with this ISP).
 ​
 Is there ANYTHING else I can check? Or do I throw this out and just get a Sophos?

 Not the worst description I've seen, but still very unhelpful. Not sure why it's so hard for users to provide any details. Is this a file from a website? Some internal application? Elsewhere? Are you using a browser? Which one? Are there any error messages? At the very least, can you provide a phone number that I can call to talk to you to get this information?
 I gently responded to the ticket asking for more details (including some prompts to make it easier). Crickets.
 Sorry for the rant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have been racking my brain and researching this issue for about a week now. Sorry if this doesn't fit here.
 The issue I've been having, is that from a oracle cloud ampere server (with a 4 Gbps link) located about 1200 km away, with 34 ms of latency, I cannot seem to get more than about 100 Mbps to my local connection. 
 I have tested it using iperf3, and even if I tinker with the settings to adjust threads it will not get any more than 100 Mbps. I have changed the mtu on both machines, changed the max tcp window size, and tried to change the hardware settings for nics on both of the machines. When I run a udp iperf3 test, I can reach the maximum speed my connection allows (1 Gbps).
 The reason why I believe more bandwidth should be possible is that when I use a wireguard vpn, I can reach tcp speeds through that connection to the server, above 600 mbps. Also, a speedtest from the server to a local speedtest server is about 1500 Mbps, and my connection to that same speedtest is at 1000 Mbps.
 I am not sure if this is just bad routing, or bandwidth delay product. Could someone shed some light on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there even a big software company that provides even middling support these days?
 This weekend was a final migration from on-prem file server to Box. Users had been warned for weeks that this was coming, that the Box app had already been pushed to their computer, and that they needed to sign in to see how it worked so they would understand how everything worked and how to access shared files once the server is down.
 Of course most users ignored this and so, expecting exactly that, I was on site first thing today to get them going.
 Unfortunately things went sideways and most people who hadn't already signed in were unable to. The company uses Google Workspace so Box had been added as a SSO app through SAML, but signing in with their Google credentials either produced a prompt to create a password (???) or an error saying "invalid credentials".
 I immediately created a ticket with tons of detail and SAML traces, got a pretty quick reply from a T1 tech who said that the accounts I referenced didn't have passwords and could I please have the users create them. After a bit of back and forth about what "SSO" stands for he escalated the ticket.
 Hours passed. Frantic web searches yielded nothing. I looked through the SAML traces myself and couldn't find anything (I know nothing about web dev but figured I'd try). I called the Box account manager, who also "escalated". Updated the ticket email with more details. Called the account manager again. Had the customer's CFO call the account manager with me on the line.
 5 hours later I got a reply from someone claiming to be a T2 tech, asking for a SAML trace from an affected user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am experiencing some very odd TLS negotiation behavior between one of our clients and the webserver/LB (different sites).
 This is only affecting one LB for only one subnet in our VDI env (no other client has presented any problems).
 I can see traffic is leaving the VDI firewall and hitting the edge in front of the web server and then leaving, however, the FW outside our VDI env is not seeing any return traffic (I find this odd since Wireshark on the client shows reset packets as well as other ACK being sent from the webserver).
 Now here is where TLS comes in. I am seeing in a Wireshark capture multiple other connections going through the same edge FWs are negotiating at TLS v1.2 and are successful. But only this one is negotiating by default as TLS v1.0 by the client and then getting a reset (since we reject v1.0 and 1.1). I have tried forcing TLS v1.2 at the browser level on the client and it still negotiates at v1.0.
 The only thing I haven't tried (since I don't have admin access to the VDI machines) is doing the windows OS-level registry change for removing TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
 Any suggestions?

 ​
 I left my previous role (Head of IT (was very hands-on/3rd line)) for an educational establishment in early 2021 as I needed a break and wanted to try something new (self empself-employedloyed retail business).
 ​
 It's been almost two years, and I'm ready to jump back into IT but struggling to land an interview.
 ​
 I do not want to go back into management. I always enjoyed the sysadmin and project side of the role, but I hated the management side. It wasn't my choice to get into management but something that happened over several years.
 ​
 Anyway, I've been applying for 2nd line/3rd line support roles as well as project-based infrastructure engineer roles. I haven't had one interview request with about 60 applications.
 ​
 I'm considering spending some downtime to re-train for a specific role since my previous roles were very general sysadmin and network support.
 ​
 I've considered either Cloud or Cyber Sec, but leaning more towards Cloud as I am more familiar with it. Likely Azure as I have had exposure to it. 
 ​
 My questions are:
  
If I pass a couple of Azure certs, am I likely to get a Azure-based role without practical experience working with Azure, considering I have 10 years of network/IT support experience?
 What over avenues can I go down to try to land a job back in IT?
  
​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubiquiti/Unifi still just seems completely non-ready for the workplace, and I've been using them for years now in spite of it.
 Trying to work on a budget here, so good Meraki gear is out of the question. A year or two ago or so, one of the UniFi "controller" upgrades put a bunch of our older, perfectly-functioning AP's out of management scope. They still run but we can't change any SSID settings or even see how many clients are connected because the hardware is EOL. I could understand a nag screen or something, but to actually take functionality away from perfectly functional hardware? Come on now.
 So we bite the bullet and pick up some new U6-LR AP's. Oh fantastic, now they are pulling 16+ watts each and overpowering the PoE switches, leading to constant reboots of the APs. Cool - it's one of the bugs that is fixed in the new UniFi "Network Application", let's upgrade that again.
 Nope! That requires installing Java 11, which seems to be either unobtainable or undetectable, because I've installed at least 3 different versions of JDK, OpenJDK, some weird third-party extraction of JRE 11, and some other garbage, just for the UniFi installer to tell me it still needs Java 11 and quit the installer. Why does the latest Unifi software not use the latest Java? We're on version 19 now for God's sake.
 So now I can't access old hardware, can't use new hardware, can't upgrade the software, and if I'm able to install it I'm sure I will run into some other new stupidity, plus have to hack my way into making it a service again because it's only a console application for some ridiculous reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is a late adopter of the cloud, though they want to go to the cloud. For On Prem we use mainly Hyper-V for Windows and RHEV for Linux. I am on the Linux side and trying to create a gold image as we don't want to use the Market Place images, due to costs and mnagement. We have about a half dozen subscriptions for Azure and each one has many resource groups. 
 ​
 In tests it looks like the market place image is easy to deploy, though it isn't what we want. Looks like custom images are tied directly into the resource group and I think, if I undrestand it correctly, we need to have a gallery to be able to use an image within the other resource groups in the same subscription, though need a seperate gallery for each subscription? It feels like there are a lot of different settings when it comes to creating an image and Azure is very picky, yet very unforgiving about things. Simple things like changing names of the image can't be done, you have to create a new image w/ the name you want.
 ​
 Due to inforced RBAC, we can only create and delete VMs, we can't create Images, which is an internal problem that we have. So it doesn't help that we have a seperate team working on it, though we are trying to have that role added to our group. The other team, which is part of the Windows Team uses Market Place Image for their stuff, so they don't have much experience with creating gold images.
 ​
 Also the latency between the cloud and our on prem enviornment seems to introduce a lot of other issues, we have to up timeouts in tools that we have no issue communicating across the country to our sister DC, though communicating between our DC and Azure in the same side of the country has time out issues.

I'd like to unify our firewall duties into a single unit (or, preferably an HA pair), and wanted to see if anyone here has advise about any of the devices I'm considering. I have a personal bias toward the Palo's, since I spent the last two years piloting a pair of 5220s. Also, my network manager has an interest in Fortinet in particular, since they offer a full stack of gear - FW, switches, and APs. I also am not interested in Cisco, partly because the $250k order I placed at my former place of employment is on month 14 without fulfillment, with no end in sight. 
 Here's the list, and thanks for looking:
 FortiGate FG-101F
 WatchGuard Firebox M590
 PaloAlto PA-1410
 CheckPoint Quantum 6200
 Sophos XGS 2100

VLAN 1 - all ports are untagged. VLAN 10 - 1-26 are tagged while 27-28 are untagged. VLan 10 - 1-26 are tagged while 27-28 are untagged. Upstream router is acting as the DHCP server for each of these VLANs but each VLAN is configured on a different subnet on the upstream router. 
 ​
 My question is how does the upstream router know which subnet to serve DHCP on?

 10.0.20.0/24 - Non working
 When request sent from pgadmin client to pgpool from non-working subnet, it takes about 15seconds for only one single packet to get processed. This happens at start of connection after three-way handshake.
 After that particular packet, subsequent packets are having <1ms RTT.
 From the same non-working setup, if we bypass pgpool, and directly access db, it works well.
 What could possibly causing this issue?
 It is consistently reproducible.

 A little background info before we start : I am originaly come from a software developper background. After some misshaps in my personal life, i've had difficulties finding a job as a developper. I then decided to apply for helpdesk positions at multiple local companies and landed myself a job at the local university.The job was advertised as a "helpdesk" position.
 I've been working there for the past 1.5 years. The transition with the person before me was a little rocky at first since i had so much to learn in so little time (AD / GPOs / Imaging / Networking ...) and i'm still learning new stuff everyday.
 I manage around 150-200 Windows 10 machines. The department uses a variety of CAD softwares ( CATIA / Inspire / MoldFlow / MSC Patran_Nastran / Vericut ...) but they mostly use SolidWorks.
 The person before used to create a windows image every year with the latest version of the softwares they use. This created a problem where the images he created were at the very least 75gb. I've been able to move away from this by automating most of the installs with scripts.
 Now that i think i have the basics down, i'd like to optimize the process and find ways to deal with SolidWorks configs in a multi-user environment.

On server side we are using switch independent teaming with dynamic load balancing with specific standby server. Whenever firewall changes from primary to secondary due to one link failure on one of server, primary firewall switches off all its connected ports to change connected servers teaming on standby mode. Now after sometimes primary firewall's all port switches on though secondary firewall is running. Now as server's active ports are on server teaming switches back to primary and firewall still in passive mode. Is there any way I can retain server NIC teaming to last state irrespective of primary port availability on server 2019.
 Thanks in Advance. Pardon for grammatical or any other mistake as I am new to this community.

 So we have a few locations where machines are randomly dying, (dell and hp), the users sometimes see an applocker style message saying an application cannot be run, please contact your system administrator, then if they reboot the machine goes into a state where it never fully boots, no real pattern at all, only oddity is they are all W10 pro boxes, and applocker is present in the domain, but those SKU's cannot run applocker (although it is logging that).
 This has only just started happening (1 end of last week, now we are seeing a lot more), anyone else seeing this?

 We've noticed every Wednesday they are installed, we'll have a random user or 2 that then can't get on via DA the next day from home. A few reboots and appears to resolve itself.
 One machine I looked at I ran
 WMIC qfe list full (not sure how accurate this command is)
 On the Wednesday it showed KB5020487 installed on a machine and then the next day DA didn't work. A few reboots later it was back working.
 Searching for KB5020487 it doesn't exist on Microsoft's KB catalog. I've now looked at other machines that haven't had DA issues but also seeing KBs being installed on the Wednesday that have no Microsoft link in their "caption" entry and don't appear in the catalog. Another one on mine I've found from November KB5020372.
 n-able is the MPS software they use.
 UPDATE before finished typing :
 Looked at a machine that has Windows 11 that's not on the domain and it to has entries with a KB installed that has no reference in the catalog KB5017233. This odd entries are appearing in Windows 10 machines as well.
 Odd.

 I am currently overthinking/revising my digital working environment, tackling some of the annoying things I experienced in the past usage.

 I hope getting your inspiration and experiences on a topic on which Google searches lead me nowhere due to plentily used keywords like "sysadmin", "windows", "tools", "application", "configuration" and so on. Those keywords lead to posts/threads like "Must have tools for sysadmin" and consorts.
 My train of thought which lead to my old setup was, to use portable versions of my needed tools whenever possible.

 In our environment we have end users which might be using any type of means to access an application (mobile, browser, citrix). Then this goes to a SaaS, then to k8s in GCP, then to an in-house developed App which is on-prem, and then to a good old backend (also on-prem). 
 Is it possible at all to keep the session ID as you pass all these steps, so that your modern session-based performance troubleshooting which you get in the microservices world, as you move to your legacy apps (in my case everything after the GCP). 
 I am trying to get at least the right keywords to google to be able to start building an understanding as to what it takes to have e2e APM in a landscape like that, if it's at all possible.

 I've got a broken Server 2016 (HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE on everything, no installed updates found, not able to add/remove roles and features, etc)
 This is a single domain-controller environment and I need to get this lifted over to a new install. (2019/2022)
 Migrating the DC itself is an OK process, but what is the most effective and least troublesome way of transferring folder redirection for 40 users to the new DC?
 I've done this once before by just robocopying eveything (with permissions and so forth) and all and change the path on the GPO, but two years later I still have calls regarding old paths.
 I've read that "copy content" is a dangerous option and I assume copying everything back to local requires everyone to re-log and will cause performance issues?
 Another thing I've read is to use DFS, however I have never touched DFS - is this the best way?
 I'd like to do it the correct way this time - what would be the best way? How is this done by the book with no future shit happening?
 EDIT: I've seen this Storage Migration Services as well, but that claims that DC's are not supported

I deleted all of the certificate files, I have tried to restart docker and the daemon. I have also tried to remove the override file that I tried to put the certificate in. To create the self-signed SSL certificate, I used the following script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexisAhmed/DockerSecurityEssentials/main/Docker-TLS-Authentication/secure-docker-daemon.sh
 For the override.conf file within /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf I used the following configuration: [Service]ExecStart=ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -D -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --tlsverify --tlscert=/home//.docker/server-cert.pem --tlscacert=/home//.docker/ca.pem --tlskey=/home//.docker/server-key.pem -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2376
 I have restarted the docker container but that has also failed to work.
 Furthermore, I have also deleted the ssl certificate so I have no idea where it is pulling the old on from.

 Their core belief is "security is something that should be accessible to everyone" and they really actually mean it. If you don't know them, let me introduce you to some of their services
  
The fastest DNS resolver in the world with high regards on privacy (free)
 DNS for families that protect against malware and/or adult content (free)
 An extremely affordable ZTNA solution (free for <50 users)
 A WAF, SSL/TLS and DDoS Protection (free for standard usecases)
  
Thank you cloudflare, for making security available to everyone, especially for private usage and small companies too.
 I highly recommend cloudflare, and I am absolutely stunned by their portfolio, their generosity and what they do. Great stuff!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are located in a small office, with lots of computers on the same subnet. The layout is pretty simple. We have an old windows 2012 server that acts as a DHCP server. A few switches and access points for wifi devices. On the edge of the network there is a Cisco firepower 1120 outside connected to the ISP and inside is connected to the main switch. We use this for RA VPN and we can reach the internet through this. We have no router, only switches and acces points.
 The problem is when the firewall is down the subnet becomes unresponsive, devices cannot ping eachother, sometimes new devices do net get IP addresses. If the firewall is removed computers should be able to arp and find other devices, and we should still get IP addresses since we have a DHCP server. In the firewall DHCP server is disabled. 
 We had an old ASA firewall and the issue was the same with that one, but I would like to get to the bottom of this problem. The firewall config is almost default, one acl to allow internet access, dhcp disabled, RA VPN enabled. NAT is the default dynamic inside,outside.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea what could be the problem? Does this has anything to do with proxy arp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in the IT Department of a company with a couple of hundred remote users, who are a mix of technicians and sales people who use their devices constantly. Occasionally I need to configure a device and have it sent to them, and because they use it all day, they need it to arrive already configured, logged in, applications set up etc etc.
 ​
 We're using InTune with AzureAD authentication, a mixture of Windows laptops/tablets and Android phones. We're encrypting the devices before sending them out etc.
 ​
 The main issue I'm having is that before I can configure a device, I need to contact the user and ask for their password. Sometimes the user is unavailable, and I can't get hold of them, which delays things, and I also worry that taking a note of their password is a bad practice.
 ​
 I wonder if there is a way that I can configure the devices and sign into the user's corporate accounts on the devices without needing their password. If not, then what is the best practice to do this?

 They have to completely restart the Terminal Server or do a complete log out and log in, in order for it to connect to both monitors again.

 I'm trying to deal with a very interesting (to me) case. Someone is proxy-mirroring all content of my website under a different domain name.
  
Original: https://www.saashub.com
 Abuser/Proxy-mirror: https://sukuns.us.to
  
My ideas of resolution:
  
Block them by IP - That doesn't work as they are rotating the IP from which the request is coming.
 Block them by User Agent - They are duplicating the user-agent of the person making the request to sukuns.us.to
 Add some JavaScript to redirect to the original domain-name - They are stripping all JS.
 Use absolute URLs everywhere - they are rewriting everything www.saashub.com to their domain name.
  
i.e. I'm out of ideas. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
 p.s. what is more, Bing is indexing all of SaaSHub's content under sukuns.us.to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I've reported a copyright infringement, but I have a feeling that it could take ages to get resolved.

 Some prerequisite info:
 CRC is a very commonly used way to detect errors in computer networks.
 P(x), G(x), R(x), and T(x) are all polynomials under binary field arithmetic (i.e., all coefficients are mod2: 0 or 1).
 P(x) is the polynomial that we are given and that we will divide by.
 E(x) is an error pattern. It is XORed with T(x) to get T'(x). G(x) is the message that we want to send.
 R(x) is the remainder of G(x)/P(x) or just G(x)modP(x).
 T(x) is our sent data, (x^k)G(x)+R(x), where k is the degree of P(x).
 T'(x) is our received data but potentially with errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a vpn server with the interface tun0 on a server. I want to open the SSH port on this server so that the ssh connection is allowed only after VPN authentication.
 Which of the following firewall rules is correct:
  
specifying the tunnel:
 ufw allow in on tun0 from any to any port 22 
 
specifying the VPN IP address:
 ufw allow from 10.8.0.2 to any port 22 
 
 Let’s say the server is at 10.8.0.1, and there is only one client at 10.8.0.2. 
 For the second rule, the interface tun0 is not specified. The IP address 10.8.0.2 is not unique. What if the packet comes from an external private IP 10.8.0.2 to the default interface eth0, not from the 10.8.0.2 in the tunnel ? It seems to me the interface must be specified not the IP, to restrict SSH to VPN.
 For the first rule, I suppose the request from 10.8.0.2 first goes to the VPN gateway, say, 10.8.0.0, and then to 10.8.0.1. So shouldn’t it be “from 10.8.0.0”?
 Another question: For the “to any,” if I specify “to 10.8.0.1,” would that prevent NAT masquerading, thus login rejection?

We were supposed to have dark fibre provided, but the contractor who did the splicing did it wrong. The fibre belongs to a local telco and the alternative they are looking at is to patch it at their CO, but this makes me a bit nervous as it makes the link completely out of my control. 
 To put my mind at ease I’ve been thinking about encrypting the traffic, but it’s not something I’ve done before. The switches are both Cisco 9200L. Is it relatively easy to accomplish and is there any added latency?

A SAP HANA server is not accessible and it’s got to be fixed ASAP. This is the start of an all day into the late evening odyssey of trying to find login credentials to one of the few physical servers that no one knows how to access. I then had to drive to the office and then over an hour to the data center, to try and figure out how to get into the old Hitachi Symphony Blade 2000 server. After numerous issues creating a jump box vm to get into the ancient remote console, I was finally able to get into the machine. No big surprise that this server has an uptime of 2768 days. I’ve been with the company for 3 years. The issue is not yet resolved but since I can now get to the console, I’m turning it back over to the customer to figure out so I can go home.

 Calling all HP 3Par all stars - am I barking up the wrong tree here? Can I do this, will it work?
 We've recently decommissioned/replaced three x HP 3Par SAN's. 1 x 7200 and 2 x 8200's. All are still functional, just out of maintenance.
 I'm contemplating building a Frankenmonster play unit and/or get out of jail free card should bad things happen.
 My thoughts were to take one of the 8200's (being newer) and harvest the others for all the good stuff - SSD's, RAM, an external disk shelf from the 7200 etc and build something as big and as good as possible given the bits I've got.
 Can I do this with the 3Par platform? I do it all the time with old servers, what about storage?
 Oh - and this will all be 100% offline too - I've kept the old FC switches and a couple of old ESX hosts to build an unsupported play area.
 Any thoughts/comments/traps greatly appreciated.
 Cheers,

 We were asked to block all RDPs on our network, and while I have most successfully blocked wither via the firwall or GPO, Splashtop seems to be a massive issue for us. We cannot block it through the firewall, and we are talking to the vendors as they are just as confused as we are. HOWEVER, I decided to block splashtop via GPO and it it still gains access to the internal PCs. 
 I have it blocked for users and computers using both the 'don't run specified application' and software restriction policies and the app still gets through. Any idea what the hell is going on? I have never seen this crap before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to replace existing Juniper gear with HPE 5900AF switches. As I don't have that much experience with HPE/Comware, I need some help.
 What the setup should look like:
 ​
 2x 10GbE Ports coming from the upstream provider, running BGP on their end. That means: BGP to the upstream provider, announcing multiple IPv4 and v6 subnets but only taking a default route.
 Customers will also terminate on the switch with a seperate vlan for each customer (And on a seperate port for each customer.) Inside of that VLAN, there will be one gateway address .1. 
 Is there something like l3Interface in Comware like it exists on JunOS or how do I connect the customer vlans to the upstream provider with the default route? Or do I need a bridge like interface for this?
 Also, are the switches capable of line rate L3 features like ACLs? Or will they suffer and choke with a few ACLs/sFlow on some ports?
 Any help is appreciated.

 We have mixed environment such as office 2013 , 2016 or 2019.
 my question: how do you organize GPOs in the environment where different office versions are installed? Let's say if I set up a GPO that only affects office 2019 and apply it to the entire Computer OU, will only office 2019 ones be affected by this policy? Or What's best practices ?

 Hey folks,
 I am using netsh interface portproxy to port forward on my Windows machine.The problem I've been facing is that whenever I reboot the computer, I need to re-add the rules again.
 I've been trying to find a solution for quite some time now and have not found anything that would solve the problem.
 Any ideas on what might be causing it and how to fix it?

I'm also 42 with only one kid left at home but she has one foot out the door so it'll just be my wife and the cat with little expenses so I'm OK with the pay cut if it's low stress and good bennies. I keep looking at the IT landscape and feel like it's going to change very fast over the next few years with consolidation (cloud/saas) and competition for jobs is increasing. I don't want to deal with that now.
 I see quite a few government job openings around the 100k range (plus wife's salary) and keep thinking that's good enough for me to coast until retirement and I know a few folks who work there saying it's gravy work. Plus there's that 20-and-out retirement I keep reading about. But I don't want to be doing absolutely anything though cause that would just suck.
 So anyway, folks who work in the government how do you like it?

 For our organization we need to deploying different PAC files to users depending on their association.
 For historical reasons this is supposed to be done in the form
 http://<IP>:8001 -> hand out PAC script1
 http://<IP>:8002 -> hand out PAC script2, etc
 Now I just want to make sure my solution is viable.
 My idea is to just take a good old Apache, have it listen on all the required ports and set the DirectoryIndex to the matching PAC file.
 Would that work?

 - Text Input mode; sometimes does not register, just continues to collect input but it does not transverse through to the other end.
 - Challenging to call up the in session menu to change input method, swipe from left to right just usually exits the app due to androids native navigation method.
 - Mouse emulation method, I've always defaulted to "drag to move" yet, with this setting enabled, I can no longer pinch to zoom which is another hurdle to overcome.
 Like what are the workarounds to make this an enjoyable experience on a mobile device without a keyboard and mouse?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing the Fawn lab on HTB and while I tried a basic -sV, it didn't show me the version of the ftp server. According to Nmap's book -sV's default is 7, but it also said that higher versions of -sV aren't as useful as lower ones. So I tried scanning at a lower version and it worked. Why is that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, we are a company with lots of different tech departments, crossed all over Europe. 
 Security is in France, sys admins in Netherlands and consultancy almost everywhere in the world. 
 Sometimes the relations between the teams is somewhat.... Strained to put it midly. 
 Any tips and advice about how to improve relations between the teams?
 I'm looking to a shout out solution integrated with our Intranet to praise your colleagues, which can be part of our bonus system eventually. 
 But any other tips are welcome. Processes, regular meetings, more top down structure all already in place.

 Openstack sucks. I want something a little more barebones like a cleaner red hat or something that's stable. 
 Just bare bones Ubuntu? I want something with a support contract. Is red hat the best?
 I'm trying to spit ball things so I can think through this problem. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian based in South America. Currently on the lookout for new clients, but concerned about my rate.
 I'm a developer and sysadmin. Lots of VMware, Ansible, Docker, OpenVPN. Have a tiny bit of experience with AWS, CI/CD (Github Actions), Networking & Security knowledge. I love Linux, tolerate Windows. Most of my programming experience has been with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Python but I'm learning Golang. 
 Disadvantages: No certs, but I'm considering studying for one of the AWS certs. I have a half finished CS degree, couldn't complete for financial reasons. 
 My current role is independent contractor for a couple small Canadian businesses. I'm definitely undercharging them ($25/hour CAD) but that's a damn good rate here in South America. 
 How much should I be charging new clients?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PowerShell default execution policy is what it is, and for administrative/political reasons I can't/shouldn't change it systemwide.
 However, I would still like to be able to have a profile script, and creating one just results in the message "(path)\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 cannot be loaded because [...] blah blah execution policy" in every new window.
 The best I've come up with so far is to make an aliased script or program (in some non-powershell language) somewhere in %PATH%, which starts powershell with -bypass, and have "set-executionpolicy Restricted -scope process" as the last line in the profile script - clunky, but at least the spirit of the execution policy would be preserved.

 For example, when creating a GRE tunnel you can set the tunnel source as the interface number or you can use an IP address. 
 What are the pros and cons of each?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 So we just had multiple clients bite the dust when it comes to e-mail because of the whole Rackspace Ransomware attack. I was just wondering if anybody had any tips for getting some of my clients' Office 365 software clients synced and running correctly. So far my process has been this:
 - Remote in through Teamviewer
 - Open Outlook
 - Backup .PST files (some of these folks have multiple mailboxes, so I make separate backups for each, which is a total pain and very tedious and time consuming)
 - Delete Profile from Control Panel > Mail Credentials
 - Run Outlook & Put In Email Address & P/W
 - Import .PST Files
 There has to be a better way. Like, I thought I should just be able to tell the email software that Hey! This is now Office 365! And then it just automatically swaps over or something. Is this really the only way to do this? Thank you for any help/tips. It is greatly appreciated as it looks like I'm starring down the barrel of a full week of 10 hour+ days if this is how it has to be. Thank you
