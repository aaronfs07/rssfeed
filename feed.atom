 Visited again 2 years ago and it was garbage.
 Visited just now and it still requires considerable amount of time troubleshooting.
 I have device targeted apps in Intune across alot of SMB clients working no problem, so the enrollment process is working as a prerequisite to Autopilot, just fine.
 First Autopilot throws a 0x81036502 app error. Attempting to pull MDM Logs from Autopilot GUI on client throws an 0x800700 Access Denied error.
 Attempting to dump the logs on c:\ through cmd fails with same error, ok fine MS says cannot dump on root.
 Tries to dump on USB stick and then again all new 0x000000 error.
 .... Autopilot still total garbage.
 At this point its still more reliable to enroll with an install/demo user, hand to client and change primary user.

The device appears to be testing PoE, but for the block of 12 ports all at once, instead of just one. I’ve asked them for info but they have no idea (or willingness to check) who made it or the model etc.
 So, does anyone happen to know about these types of devices, or what this is called? Or something that achieves the same thing? I’ve searched and searched, but only find single port testers. My team has the need to test PoE on switches, often times several dozen, so a device that tests multiple ports like this would be really useful. Thank you!

 A few months ago at my job, I managed to transfer 5PB of data across continents with just these tools tools - rsync, gnu parallel, tmux and gdu. Had to use these tools because the environments didnt allow to install any other ones. This was my first time doing a transfer of such a scale with such tight constraints on tools and managed to complete it in approx. 3 months. Given this information, I wanted to know what the wider market thinks of this. How much would you give this effort out of 10? Or on a scale of (1) I'd hire you for triple the pay (2) Ok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a late night of dealing with this issue. We had a notice in one of our old R720 that a drive in the RAID10 went offline. I went out and replaced it like normal. The system is setup with C: as the OS and D: as has the Hyper-V files.
 Typically, a rebuild for this array takes about 12 hours. Right now, it's estimating 12 days! The odd thing is, the entire system has slowed to a crawl. Any IO on C: or D: brings the system to a crawl. Programs lock up for a few minutes.
 Looking at the event logs, and I'm getting a bunch of the following events:
  
Event 9, Hyper-V-StorageVSP - An I/O request for device 'C:\Virtual Hard Disks\XXXX.vhdx' took 10675 milliseconds to complete. Operation code = READ16, Data transfer length = 4096, Status = SRB_STATUS_SUCCESS. We are getting this error for both C and D drives.
 
Event 129, percsas2i - Reset to device, \Device\RaidPort0, was issued.
 
 We also use VeeamOne and are getting disk latency alarms for both drives.
 I am able to export the VMs across the network to a different system without any issues.
 At this point, I'm thinking maybe a raid controller or backplane issue. Any thoughts? I'm super tried so pardon my if my post didn't make sense.
 Notes: Yes, I know the R720 is ancient. Everything on it is backed up and safe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 At a loss and need some help.
 We are a small/medium sized business. 70ish people. Have a Watchguard Router and Unifi AP's/Switches.
 Ran into an issue last week where our 16-XG died. Would keep shutting off randomly. Couldn't find one available immediately, so had to reroute the cables to a different switch on the rack while we found a replacement.
 Got a USW-Pro-Aggregation to replace it.
 Switched everything to the new one, thought we were all in the clear.
 Started getting emails around 11/11:15 at night that VPN/network was down. Reboot the Watchguard and everything is back up and running. Get the same messages in the morning around 6:30/7 pm. Watchguard reboot fixes it again.
 More of the same all week, thought I might've plugged a cable in wrong somewhere, and that was causing issues. Gone over all of them, and everything looks to be fine. Thought maybe our backups were causing the issue, since they run at around 11pm at night, kinda made sense.
 Turned off Backups last night, same thing happened.
 Turned them back on tonight, and same thing happened.
 In the Unifi Console, the amount of clients on certain switches doubles. The switches at times show a Down speed of 79641 Mbps, but average 300-1000Mbps. Clients also show a huge download. But on the PC's I can't see anything being downloaded. Looks like there's a ton of traffic from the backups using Wireshark. But my knowledge of Wireshark is very limited.
 The only way to get things going again is by rebooting the Watchguard, or one of the network switches.
 Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because of this thread, I brought it up with my therapist and was just diagnosed conditionally as inattentive ADHD at a late age. I have another appointment with a doctor that is going to go through some things with me to give me a "second opinion" on my conditional diagnosis.
 A month ago when the post was first put out there I read it in full, comments and all, and almost everything that people were putting out there seemed to jive with how I am. 
 I dive deep into MANY MANY things/hobbies I'm interested, I misplace things easily, I jump from topic to topic, or task to task at work, and many other things that jived with the post/comments.
 My therapist also explained that many folks who undergo many stressors during a young age, like I was brought up, don't usually get diagnosed with ADHD. Their brains bar for stress is much higher and it's usually chalked up to that. 
 I want to thank /u/sobrique for bringing this topic up and leading me down an enlightening path. 
 I have recently seen on reddit posts after the above post that ADHD is very heavily linked to alcoholism and I with alcoholism. I don't drink during the day( or even think about drinking alcohol), and only at night a little too much and things have become unmanageable with relationships in my life. I have been seeking help with alcoholism for quite some time, I had a long hiatus from alcohol and fell back in recently after some stressful situations. I am hoping that this diagnosis, with a coupled medication(dopamine levels normalizing, and not partaking), can help me get off of alcohol and get the old me back. 
 I have blathered on too long and need to go to bed now. I thank you all for being you and reading my post. Their is hope in this world and I love you all. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, i have a consideration of building a network for data center.. It'll only be for IoT devices that's related to the dc operational needs, like cctv, electrical or temp sensor, etc. There will be 5 floors, and approximately around 17 thousands of ip or endpoints will be used.
 So i'm considering using vxlan for the sake of IP efficiency and broadcast storm prevention, since there'll be 5 floor and the switches will be put everywhere.
 Is there a best way to do the segmentation? Considering using a /17 subnet in one vlan, i'm a bit afraid of the domain failure. If I use dedicated / different vlan for each floor (by floor vlan segmentation), i can't see the benefit of the vxlan is utilized. (And also, i think there'll be unused ip since the allocated subnet can't be used in different floor) If I use dedicated / different vlan for each specific IoT category, i'm considering about the dailyops, since there'll be no thing such as ISE or ClearPass in place..
 Any advise / suggestion will be much appreciated, thank you in advance

I do M365 setups and administration all of the time and I understand how to enable MFA, legal holds, transport rules, etc. just fine. But even after spending the last half hour on google I can't seem to find anything that actually spells out what makes a M365 tenant HIPAA compliant. Everything is just a damn advertisement or article that eventually ends in "Get a free consultation with XYZ" and I'm like... I know how to do all of the things individually, I just need to know what rules need to be followed so I can put the darn controls in place.
 Is there somewhere I can read the exact requirements/guidelines? Thanks folks

 What sort of equipment can I use to tie this into network? I would like to use 1gbps for now and upgrade to 5g or 10g in the future if possible.
 I currently have HPE switches. I know you get SFP module I am just unsure about the exact specs needed. 
 Also should the terminations be SC or LC?

 Are there any decent corporate browsers anymore that aren't Chrome or Edge? I'm actually considering looking at Firefox.
 Edge was actually a decent alternative to Chrome for a bit but they continue to add so much ridiculous bloat to it that it's a joke now and I'm convinced whoever is in charge of that team is on drugs. The list of things I have to disable on Edge via GPO was already huge.

 I'm newer here and we are a 2 man IT dept that will expect to blow up from 40 or so to nearly 200 total users.
 All we do is cloud based nothing on prem (fyi).
 That said, I want to search for an easy to use ticketing system that we can learn to configure and have our users to use it to submit tickets instead of hitting us up on teams or calls. My goal is to streamline support so this casual walk-up stops and folks submit a ticket.
 Also this ticketing system needs to be hosted by them, as we so not have servers on prem. 
 I have used service desk by manage engine, service now but never as an admin of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bit of an issue, and I am by no means a networking expert, so please be gentle....
 I have 11 sites, interconnected with Prisma ION-1000 SD-WAN devices. Most of the sites have 2 ISP connections. We have been using DHCP on most of the Verizon boxes we use, but have run into issues of connectivity between several of the sites. This week, they replaced the ION device at one of our locations, and we additionally asked Verizon for a static IP for the location. They assigned the IP to the wireless box and provided us with the info. As I was digging into the settings and info today, I realized that the IP they had assigned to us is the IP of the Default Gateway of one of our other devices. I remember seeing this previously, when configuring 4 other Verizon devices for distribution to locations, and thought it odd. The new device has connectivity issues, and I am unsure how to fix the problem, or if this is even possible, in this configuration? Am I missing something, or can I configure something specifically to alleviate the problem? Thank you, in advance.

 I looked at documentation from the recipient's DNS (mx1.privateemail.com) and also Google, and my basic knowledge isn't helping. The recipient's documentation suggests Google rejected this message, but I'd normally see this the other way around, where the recipient rejected it.
 Did the recipient's server reject this due to a high probably of spam? Or did Google reject this and it not send it because there was a high probability of it being spam?

 ​
 I have a strange behavior on my company network and after many hours, I can't understand or find any logic.VLAN's are configured on Fortigate 80F firewall (VLAN ID24 for guest network, on 10.4.24.0/24 with 10.4.24.200 GW) and I've tagged the VLAN ID 24 on my Netgear S3300 switch.
 When I connect through wired cable a Windows 10 laptop, everything is fine. My client received an IP from DHCP delivered by the firewall, I get my IP, gateway, mask, DNS... and I can get outside through my gateway normally
 But when I connect a laptop with a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Centos or a device with a Linux kernel), I get an IP from DHCP but I can't go outside and I can't ping my gateway.
 I've tried with 3 linux (live usb boot) differents, same behavior.
 I've verified the routes and eveything seems to set correctly
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 0.0.0.0; 10.4.24.200; 0.0.0.0; UG 20100 0 0 enp2s0
 10.4.24.0; 0.0.0.0; 255.255.255.0 U 100 0 0 enp2s0
 ​
 If some kind soul could help me to understand what is going on :)

 Racks are connected with 10Gb/s OM4 fiber optics cables.Asking ourselves how many routers we should plan.We thought about just one firewall router, configured in high availability mode (if one fails, the second one kicks in). So, just one router at time which will be providing both LAN routing and LAN to WAN routing.
 Assuming a VAR who specialises in networks planning, is working on this, do you see any weak points in this scheme? Any comment is highly appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 Recently got into this weird issue.
 My Macbook M2 cannot seem to connect to certain private IPs using certain protocols (as stated in the title). Let's say the private IPs are all in the range of 192.168.0.0/16, my Macbook is in 10.0.1.0/24
 - I can connect to some hosts in 192.168.12.0/24, by their open ports/listening services (say HTTPS)
 - I cannot connect to other hosts in 192.168.13.0/24, by their open ports/listening services. Even telnet to ports do not return anything (which seemed like an indicator of a firewall in between)
 - However, there are no firewalls or access lists in between my Macbook and the destinations - I confirm this since this is the network that I manage and own, and there have been no anomalies detected. No routing configuration changed.
 - I can ping/traceroute using ICMP to the hosts
 - Another colleague's Macbook, in the same source as 10.0.1.0/24 can connect to mentioned host without problems
 - I have done tcpdump with the following commands, which return no packets if the traffic belongs to one of the affected flow (say the host I'm trying to connect to is 192.168.13.13)
 sudo tcpdump -nnvv host 192.168.13.13 0 packets captured 0 packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel 
 - For a certain Window DNS server in 192.168.13.0/24, I can use it to resolve the DNS queries (via dig). I cannot, however, connect to it via RDP (while I was able to just one week ago). Tcpdump displayed DNS requests/responses, ICMP requests/replies, but no RDP traffic even coming out of the Macbook
 ​
 This has recently happened. I'm currently on Ventura 13.2.1
 ​
 Please assist me in this case. This subreddit does not allow crossposting from r/macbook, so this would be a duplicate thread :)
 ​
 P.s: I have also restarted my Macbook a few times. Not gonna work with such trick

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thought I would post this in case others haven’t thought to leverage Connectwise to install the Office update for CVE-2023-23397. We have 700 on premise domain joined Windows 10 machines in offices and remote/home locations. Moving to Intune soon but not there yet.
 Here's what we have done making it a breeze:
  
Notified staff that any MS Office applications left open on the screen would shut down @ 11:00 when we sent the command.
 WOL all office based devices
 Highlighted all machines in Connectwise and sent the command below
  
"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\OfficeC2RClient.exe" /update user displaylevel=false forceappshutdown=true 
  
Any machines online updated there and then including machines not logged into.
 For the 300 or so machines not turned on, as and when they have been coming online, they have checked in with Connectwise and the original queued command has then run updating office.
  
Along with using https://config.office.com/ to track progress, In Connectwise we have also used a custom property to store the office version/build and then scope a session group to this to keep track of unpatched versions.
 Command for Custom Property: 
 Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty VersionToReport 
 Session Group – Subgroup expression (remember to update refresh custom properties):
 IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*16130.20306', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*16026.20238', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*15928.20298', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*15601.20578', 'PATCHED', IIF (CustomProperty4 LIKE '*14931.20944', 'PATCHED', 'NOT PATCHED')))))

 I was reviewing Microsoft Defenders 'Experts on Demand' costings, and have seen this has now been rebranded to Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting.
 After talking to the Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting team, it seems we're not eligible for a few reasons.
 So my question, does anyone have any alternatives to the 'Microsoft Defender Experts on Demand' option, to support our Microsoft Defender environment in for any scenarios where incidents are too advanced for our inhouse IT.
 I am not looking for an alternative to 'Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting', just the 'Microsoft Defender Experts on Demand' option.
 Kind Regards,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I'm the developer and owner of a web application that's grown in popularity (and so visibility) over the past few years. In the last month or so, this has brought something new our way with a series of what I'm quite certain are DDoS attacks. Nothing that would crash Facebook, but HTTP requests for our landing and login pages at a rate of ~1000/second without follow-up for the page's resources. Attacks are happening maybe a few times a week.
 I've been building an IP blacklist from the points of origin, am rate-limiting these pages by IP, and have split login onto its own server, so that when these pages get flooded most of our users are not impacted. All of that has done a lot to mitigate the effects of these attacks.
 What's the long-term game, though? Should I be concerned that we're seeing regular attacks, or is this just a product of seeing more traffic? Are there other measures I should be taking? Can I be a better citizen of the internet by reporting points of origin to somewhere?
 Thank you so much for your thoughts on this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been an admin for a few years now, but despite my efforts it seems like the back side of our server racks always end up a mess. When I have the time, I will go through and try and clean up cables and get everything looking nice and neat, but I find it very frustrating since it seems like I keep making shortsighted decisions that I have to fix later on. 
 I used to have a similar problem to this back when I did more development work. I would struggle with naming classes and variables, but I eventually learned that using standards and good principles helped me get past those issues. Is there some sort of equivalent for server racks? It feels like an odd question but, I'm running out of ideas here... I'm also getting tired of having to unplug a bunch of stuff before I can slide a server out for maintenance.
 To provide some context I'm mostly dealing with Poweredge servers, with a few other oneoff devices mixed in.

I'm having some trouble with what this all means and what the resolution path is for users that have these findings.
 The only thing from MS I've found is to just update the client, for users with findings are you guys resetting passwords as well? Just looking for more guidance.

 Users have been emailing external people and some have started coming back saying there is a PNG on the email. 
 This PNG is a blank 1x1 attachement with a file name like: 
 0e79bd18-2e8b-470a-bd12-bab865673dc1
 Ive had the same user email me and my external email address and this attachment has been missing from both the emails. 
 It looks like its present on an email that was only sent internally but un-sure if something may of been forwarded in that body and then edited out. 
 We have exclaimer which im edging towards being the problems but my knowledge with this system isn't the greatest. Just wondering what other idea people have as to what it may be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have PingID for SSO and MFA and have our M365/Azure authenticate through it. Here recently we've had some key users get locked out of AD constantly. This is because the authentication requests go to our DC to authenticate each SSO authentication, and because it's a brute force attempt, it's constantly locking out those users. 
 I reached out on multiple occasions to PingID and they dismissed it as "non issue" or pointed the finger back at us. I finally got some escalation and was taken semi-seriously at pointing out this issue (exploit??) and here was there recommendation: "Turn off AD lockout" What? So remove a security measure to open up an even bigger risk? Let them brute force the crap out of each user until they get the correct password, then move on to the next steps? Why would we give them that ability? We've asked Ping to provide logs of where the attacks are coming from, IP's, location, something. They refuse to give any. Their dashboard doesn't provide logs because they never (yet) have made it past the first authentication factor. It only logs on second factor.
 Ping recommends buying another product (Ping Federate) to solve this issue, but has not provided any details on how that fixes the issue. We also don't feel we should have to purchase more products from them to fix "their" issue.
 Here's where I'm stuck. Azure shows no logs. Purchased Azure AD P2 hoping that would help. No change in Azure AD logs. Nothing showing where the authentication attempts are coming from. Tried various geolocation and IP reputation blocks on Ping, nothing because it doesn't block until second factor. What else could be do to stop the AD Lockouts without "turning off AD Lockout" as Ping carelessly suggested? Anyone else experience this with PingID, or another provider?

 Within Intune > Devices > Windows, on the "OS Version" filter, everything displays "10.0.1xxx" or "10.0.2xxx" I'd have assumed that it would show "11.0.0" or something similar for a Win 11 machine, unless I'm mistaken?
 It might be worth noting, our current Windows 11 machines were upgraded from Windows 10, not Windows 11 out of the box.
 Appreciate the help! :) And again, apologies if I'm potentially being silly at all here.

 I’ve been experimenting with application recognition and finding it a bit hit and miss. For example, google Remote Desktop seems cannot be recognised with 4.5.0 along with many others that are listed. In the old days anything with application awareness needed to be updated fairly regularly to stay up to date with application signatures. Is this a reason to run a pretty current software release? Not sure how good VMware SD-Wan is at application awareness but would have thought pretty good ?

 ​
 I wanted to get some long term real live usage feedback from you, since it's hard to find not sponsored and not auto generated reviews nowadays.
 ​
 I already use a password manager for my private day to day logins, so It's easier to remember the master pwd than all the ssh keys, and other tokens and logins. I have to switch often between systems, and to have to spin everything up is a pain, and keys/tokens in a set up script is an absolute no go. Being able to have access to all the keys from the console seems grate. 
 ​
 I use keeper as my private pwd manager and I'm happy with it, but 1password seems attractive too.
 What are your takes regarding these two?
 Maybe you all have another suggestion?
 Or another good solution? 
 My criteria:
 - simple commands and quick access to the basic functionalities (I don't need to manage it through the console, i just want to access)
 - my sysadmin at work should be happy
 - mobile app and browser extension (if on the go or having to access smthng through the browser)

So we have manager's team, where MD is the top manager and I can view all people directly reporting to him within the list of those calendars, but how do i include sub-managers team's into it as well? 
 Also, how do i enable employee reporting to sub-manager's to be able to view to full team as well? 
 I was hoping it was achievable through "manager's team calendar" as it's autodiscovery kind of feature without any setup for the users, rather than manually sharing or setting each mailbox to reviewer etc. 
 ​
 Any guidance appreciated, many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if similar cases have been asked before, but here's the situation:
 We have IOT devices out on the field, and these devices are hooked up to modems. These modems have generic 4G SIM cards in them. The IOT devices use this public 4G connectivity to push data to an FTP server unsecurely. CTO wants to change this. CTO wants to put the FTP server behind a private subnetwork, and he wants to have the 4G SIM modems connect to a VPN with a peering to the private subnetwork with the aforementioned FTP server.
 Here's the thing: I'm not sure how this works. The usage of 4G SIM cards means that the IP address is dynamic or keeps changing. Furthermore, the modem only supports some old L2TP/IPSEC protocol. As the CTO wants this to be on Azure, I've read about Azure Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site, but I don't know how to relate this back to these modems.
 Does anyone know how this is accomplished?
 The traffic goes from public 4G to VPN Client to Azure VPN Gateway subnet to private network with the FTP server.

 The Issue: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/ldap-troubleshooting/
 For this setup im using windows 11 home edition and kali linux but for some reason i keep getting the server 91 error. I've tried more than 7 types of configurations scenarios - which have all failed.
 Collector won't see or collect information through LDAP query 
 Clearly I'm missing something that i am not aware of...
 If someone can point me in the right direction i will be eternally grateful:

 I'm currently trying to configure a new Microsoft hosted mail-adress linked to our heating-system to the alarm-smtp-service, but because of its age, I guess it still uses port 465 for smtp, now I can't find a way to send it and there is no extra slot to configure the port. Whenever I use the Powershell SMTP for testing on ports 25 and 587 it works like a charm, 465 doesn't go through at all.
 Is there a workaround for this, or should I just use an external mail-provider for that?
 If I didn't elaborate enough, please just tell me, maybe I can provide more info :)

 The issue we have is that the networks IP addresses are stored in some Excel files which are :
  
Difficult to update
 A PITA to use to add any more info than the name and IP of the device
  
I'm looking for a better solution, I tried netbox but it seems to be overkill and too much tailored to DC usage which we aren't. We do already have some of our equipements mapped using DNS names and reverse PTR in our DNS (which I also needs to migrate from a 15+ y/o server) which are monitored using zabbix. But Zabbix is only a monitoring tools, not a network mapping/inventoring one. My boss/coworker also tried at some point using Mediawiki, but the issue remains it's a PITA to maintain.
 So, fellow sysadmins, what do you recommend to replace those old Excel files ?

 Why is the client not using the secondary DNS? It's all right setup on the NIC configuration

 Edit: I shut down the first DNS for testing.

 What I have collected so far:
  
Ubiquiti is a few steps below professional grade brands, as a whole
 Aruba series gets a lot of fans and seems to be a good overall solution
 Juniper Mist APs growing strong
 FortiXXX strong on firewalls, weaker on switching
  
This brings me to these ideas:
  
Use Fortigate for firewalling
 Use one-brand setup for switching, to keep things easier to manage
  
At this stage, I miss some thoughts about Juniper switches..... Is there any user who has an experience with these devices?

 I was contacted by a company recently for a job that looks quite neat.
 As I looked into the company I found out it is a (huge) debt collection agency. If they collected debts only from companies I'd probably be fine.
 But they also collect from the normal day to day person, say some poor sod just getting behind on bills due to unfortunate circumstances ending up collection horrible interest rates and something that was a couple hundred ends up in the thousands. I'd sort of be making money from making people miserable. Call me a bleeding heart or whatever, but that's the way it is.
 So I decided that just wouldn't fly with me.
 I've worked with things that may be considered unethical as well, legal intercept amongst others, but all I ever heard were people conspiring on fraud of various kinds. I was fine with that.
 So, boiled down, I wonder if anyone else ever said no to a job due to the product the company offers?

 I’ve been hired as a network engineer somehow and they want to build a new DC. My boss is requesting my input on having perimeter and internal (local network facing) firewalls. However as per my understanding, the main idea of that is for the DMZ, and we don’t have any need for it currently since all of our public services are in the cloud. Is having 4 firewalls worth it in that case? Are there any other use cases?
 ISP ——> Perimeter FW ——> DMZ ——> Internal FW ——> Network 
 Right now we purchased 2 Fortigate firewalls for the perimeter, and we’re thinking of adding 2 Palo Alto FW’s.

 I haven’t taken any classes in probably 15 years because I learn best by doing not trying to ingest knowledge with no application, and I’m finding the whole experience to be less than optimal; jumping between three different environments breaks concentration, videos aren’t conducive to skipping back to review info, and I don’t feel I’m learning anything. I have two big monitors on my desk, which should be enough space for all this but it still feels inefficient. 
 My boss tells me I should take more classes when (if? Lol) I complete this one, but quite frankly, if this is the new normal for online learning it sucks.

 This may be old news, but I logged onto a dozen different clients and they did not have it turned on, so I guess not a lot of people know about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 We're mainly Macs (managed by Mac only MDM), but have a handful of Win devices that aren't managed atm. Normally I'd go straight to Intune, but since our org doesn't run on M365 (Apps for biz is the highest we go), Intune isn't the best option price wise. So looking for recommendations for other Win MDMs.
  
Hexnode looks interesting, and is cheaper than Intune.
 Scalefusion is a hard no due to their sales tactics.
 Managengine is a no due to some reviews in this sub...plus it's more expensive than Intune.

 Even when you manually update the definitions to the latest, the older versions still show as needed in the WSUS console instead of disappearing as superseded. 
 Is there a fix for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am attempting to host a Windows shared drive across a StS VPN. Below is the network configuration along with IPs. I am also pretty new to this so go easy on me lol
 ​
 Site 1 - Where Shared Drive will be hosted. 
 USG Pro4 - 
 Server Address: 76.XXX.XX.XX
 Shared Remote Subnets: 10.0.5.0/24
 Remote IP 108.XX.XX.XXX
 Key Exchange Version: IKEv2
 Encryption: AES-256
 Hash: SHA1
 DH Group: 14 
 Options for PFS and Route Based VPN checked, Route distance "30"
 ___
 Site 2 - Needs access to Shared Drive 
 Datto DNA Appliance 
 Local Ispec ID: 108.XX.XX.XXX (Same as "Remote IP")
 Remote ISpec ID: 76.XXX.XX.XX (Same as "Server Address from Site-1) 
 Remote Subnets: 192.168.1.0/24
 IKE Mode: IKEv2
 Encryption Algorithm: AES-256
 Hash: SHA1
 DH Group: Group 14: 2048 bit
 (Option for "Dynamic Phase 2" disabled, Dead Peer Detection Enabled)
 ​
 With this current configuration I can ping the gateway of Site 2 from Site 1 but I cannot ping vice versa and I am starting to get frustrated. It's confusing as there are multiple differences in language between the options. 
 Perhaps there is a better option?
 Any ideas would be greatly and thoroughly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently implemented some ties between a small number of racks in a DC using FS 24 fibre MTP polarity solution. We used all SMOF components (standardising on SMOF in the DC) consisting of: 24F Type A Cassette <> 24F Type A trunk cable <> 24F Type AF Cassette. This works and allows standard A-B patch cables on either end when patching. Essentially Port 1 maps to Port 2 on the remote cassette (rolling the fibre). However, there was a bit of confusion during installation as each A cassette had to match with an AF.
  
I understand polarity with the 3 solutions for MTP-12 (Method A, B, C). Are these exactly the same for MTP-24? 
 Could we have achieved the same result using 2x 24F Type A cassettes, and a 24F Type C trunk cable in between? 
 What are others doing for inter-rack patching in the DC - sticking with straight-through 1-1 polarity (A/A/A solution) and using A-A patch cables on one end, or using the inter-rack MTP to roll the fibre (either with a A/A/AF or A/C/A solution)?
  
I'm also looking to break out some 400G and 100G ports to 4x100G and 4x10G respectively.
 My understanding is I would use a QDD-4X100G-LR-S or QSFP-4X10G-LR-S connecting to a 3 x 8F MTP cassette (each cassette could break out 3 ports from the switch) using a MTP-12 Type A trunk cable. Is this the best way of breaking out ports to 4x standard duplex LC connectors?

Got to the final round of a MSP and when I mentioned tech stacks they begrudgingly admitted their customers are heavy ibm legacy Java enterprise web applications users and the ticketing system is BMC remedy from 2009. 
 These systems have caused so much grief over the years I simply could not imagine working on them full time. The amount of security advisories alone can send your teams mental state to oblivion. 
 I felt bad turning them down but the hiring manager was very professional about it. Even mentioned hiring staff was becoming increasingly difficult as young or old hires are well aware these products reputation precedes them. The support teams are anemic and on a month to month biases vulnerabilities could pile higher than a dung beetle rolling shit. Anyone else have a vendor they simply won’t work anymore, with would love to hear why humorous or not.

 My answer was that as long as it isn’t statically assigned, the phone would follow any DHCP / Network settings of the home office environment.
 Am I missing anything here? This was raised by a young person, so, wondering if it’s a possibility a gap on their end or if I’ve missed something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working with this one client for a few years. They’re a break fix client, and I was trying to get them to approve some network improvements at one of their sites. It had an EoLed routers, switches, APs, the works. Additionally, the whole network was flat (a single subnet for their security system as well as their guest devices), and full of holes: ports 22, 80, 443, were open. They had some vulnerable VPN server running as well… it was a mess, and the whole thing needed to be overhauled, if not just dumped gasoline on. 
 Because there was a pile on of vendors who had performed work on this network over the years, there was also, of course, zero documentation. 
 When I went to segment the network, almost every device that had been installed had a static IP that was set inside of a password protected console. The job which should have taken a couple of days quickly turned into a nightmare. I had to track down ghost vendors. We had to call alarm companies. I had to get in touch with the people who installed a stupid TV remote, which only they had software to manage. After I called them, they asked why they “couldn’t access the TV remote’s management directly via the public IP address?”
 I learned to hate the static IP with a passion.
 So here’s my public service announcement: please set your damn static IPs via the router’s DHCP sever! That way they’re easier to manage if you need to move things around.

The DCI setup uses EVPN multisite for the border-gateways in the new DC (DC2) and vanilla vPC VTEPs in DC1. I'm transitioning from a classic setup in DC1 with VRRP on the SVIs, to distributed anycast-gateway in DC2. The plan was to stitch the vlans between DCs via the border-gateways, then per vlan when half the hosts are migrated shutdown the VRRP SVI and bring up the anycast-gateway SVI.
 I've realised that for vlans I've stitched across the DCI, I can't reach the anycast-gateway address from hosts in the legacy DC. The VTEPs in the new DC just don't advertise EVPN routes for those interfaces. I guess this makes sense conceptually, as the anycast-gateway is intended for hosts directly connected to the leaf. However I do need some hosts in the legacy DC to route via an SVI on the border-leafs in the new DC as part of the migration process.
 As a workaround I tried spinning up an SVI with VRRP on the border-leafs in DC2, which I thought would be a valid workaround which I could then transition to anycast-gateway once the vlan was emptied from DC1. But the SVI is suspended as soon as I remove fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway from the SVI config.
 Is this a known behaviour in VxLAN EVPN with anycast-gateway, that you can't combine a FHRP and anycast-gateway on the same leaf? Or perhaps a specific limitation with Cisco NX-OS?
 I was hoping to avoid having to extend all of the L3VPN constructs to the vPC VTEPs in DC1 as this is a manually managed DC (new DC is operated with Apstra) and this would increase the complexity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So if any remember my story I was a desktop support tech that ended up being single IT person for an organization as “network administrator” with a small raise with no training hand off or help. I believe I have been trying to do the job of about 5 ppl. Initially I even stayed full nighters and work next day without sleep. There was so much demand and pretty much have been treated like garbage. There have been many crying alone days and near a complete mental breakdown. I found a new job and gave my notice and what I feared would happen is happening. They will try to bully me into a consulting deal. I gave them one and a half week notice as I had not clearance yet from new job. They’re saying I have a moral obligation to stay longer to train someone since I’m the only person that knows these systems for years. I told them I will write all documentation necessary. I know they prob asked their lawyer as a lot of legal terminology is used when talking with me so that tells me they’ve been asking their in house lawyer what are their options. They tried to promise matching salary and hiring more ppl but I don’t trust them and they’re bullies. I’m glad I didn’t tell them where I’m going as I’m starting to see their ugly character hidden thinking about ways to threaten me in one way or another. Idk how they do it as I know they’ve bullied others that have resigned into something similar. But I want nothing to do with them. I need to focus on my new job. They’re saying things will break and I leave them in a very bad position.
 Any advice is appreciated to how to handle this situation. I know once I finally say no to everything they will look for ways to threaten me or get back at me or get me in the hook w signing something that will make me liable. All advice is appreciated.

 We are using Avocent ACS8000 Console Switch which uses Termviewer to show console connections. When trying to perform password recovery on an NX-OS by sending the break command CTRL + ] it closes the termviewer rather than sending the command through the terminal. 
 I have seen some forums suggesting sending the break command by using the options menu in the termviewer, but there is no menu for these termviewer windows inside the console switch gui's.

It’s like every time I want to activate a phone it’s a new kind of request they have never handled before and confuses the hell out of them. Also why is the phone call quality to the phone company always so bad? AT&T Internet down? Good look using the “express ticketing” system! You need an “asset ID” to get started and as far as I can tell that information has never been provided to me. Have you ever tried navigating the AT&T portal. It may as well be in an alien language. In one location we have a smaller company that resells AT&T service and a network engineer answers the phone by the third ring. I highly recommend buying AT&T from a company with better customer service. 
 A lot of companies just want to kick the ticket back to you by always asking for more stuff. After a week of that, we usually figure out the solution on our own, or just give up. Jamf has been irritating me by doing this lately. 
 Microsoft? They have never resolved an issue for me. I don’t even try to get help from them anymore. 
 Ring Central. My “customer success manager” doesn’t respond to my emails and has never followed through with anything they promised…not once. 
 Shout out to Meraki for being available 24/7 and their level 1 support really knows their stuff.

 First off, they're perfectly fine with telling me that an issue is my problem because "IT" yet nearly all of their equipment needs to involve me at some point. Microphone not working? Must be IT's problem. Can't pick up that person in class? IT's problem. Then they give shitty customer service when users need help with their system. Finally, send it to their "vendor" who basically does everything for them. 
 Oh, you have 30k of equipment in a shitty rack not mounted to anything with NO ventilation, and yet you wonder why your BiAmp goes berserk when it's burning itself up in the rack you spec'd, with zero space between components?
 And the arrogance... I started out remodeling auditoriums. I know the technologies they use. The issues they're trying to solve have existed for decades.
 Yet, they never report directly to IT, they report to someone who thinks their shit is magic and they are exalted from on high.
 Does anyone have good strategies to:
 1) Hold them accountable for their work product?
 2) Understand that this is a PARTNERSHIP, not an IT vs AV fight?
 3) Help their managers understand that they are not gods
 Thanks everyone for letting me blow off some steam.

 I give the switch an ip address
  
And boom, internet flowing and access to everything is there!
 So I try copy running-config startup-config then reload. My configuration is gone.
 I re configure and try write memory and reoad. Then all config is gone.
 So I re config and try write mem and copy running config back to back. Every time it says it is writing the config.

The MSP used Kaseya as their RMM and gave me access to it. Now that I'm wanting to move away from the MSP, I'm working on implementing our own tools to manage our devices. We are pretty much a Microsoft shop because it's what I'm familiar with. I've already enrolled all of our Windows devices in Azure/Intune and wanting to replace Kaseya. I know there are many unattended remote control solutions that would replace what I primarily use Kaseya for, but one thing I can't seem to find without an RMM is something that gives live device inventory: what PC's are currently on, users that are logged in, IP address of the PC, last reboot time, last agent check in time, and hardware details. Azure/Intune give some but not all of this. Most importantly I'd like to know what computers are on and connected and if anyone is logged in. I'm sure you can run custom scripts with Powershell and/or Microsoft Graph, but looking for something on a web interface. Is this possible with any of Microsoft tooling, and if not, what other solutions would provide what I'm looking for? I know RMM's are geared towards MSP's so simply looking for something for myself for internal use to monitor devices.

 I am a big fan of silent software installation.
 And I've been told our NAV 2018 would be OK to run as a fat client, on our client pcs.
 So I want to build a silent installation script with our configuration setup.
 But I seem to be unable to find anywhere, that states the config.xml syntax for the silent installation of the software. I even tried to ask ChatGPT - which by the way, gave me the closest to something that could potentially be the correct syntax.
 Though the syntax it gave me, was two different variations. And none of them worked, after adjusting the values to fit our environment.
 ​
 So I am hoping, that someone smarter and more experienced than me, has a template or can point me in the correct direction, to get this application installed silently.

 I've come to the conclusion I need some professional feedback, if I'm just lazy or come to a kinda correct conclusion. Most of our central services is already hosted by an MSP, but not this (and they don't want to).
 So we have an alarm system to mobilize our workforce in an event. Central Server; calls a list of numbers; maybe do it again. I got this system handed over with following specs: old desktop pc; 2 LineCards for connecting to a PBX via ISDN.
 Now we came to a point, where we want to have geo-redundancy and multiple tenants. In the fist meeting we came to the conclusion it would be alright elevate the pc to a VM, connect to the PBX via VoIP (which I already planed). Create a second VM do the same, connect to a second PBX and use the build-in clustering mechanic from the software. Sounds easy enough with an second MSP which is selling the software.
 So my point is: In second thought I remembered there is a cloud solution for this software. Now I'm kinda torn between self-hosting or SaaS. SaaS, would solve my and my team lacking knowledge in PBX-tech and geo-redundancy (or at least outsource it). As the system is kinda critical, I'm questioning the reliabilty of the cloud, which would be better than right now, but if we self-host we can call the internal deskphones without external calling.
 TL;DR: would you move a critical alarmingsystem to the cloud or not?

We used to only need 1 IP address per classroom but now when we upgrade a room or get a new building we are using 5-20 addresses per room. Tracking these in an excel spreadsheet isn't working great anymore as we have 6 campuses and over 500 classrooms and things get missed. Thank you for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using no-ip.org for dynamic dns, with a TP-link router.
 Everything seems to work fine, router automatically changes my Ipv4 address for the domain i chose.
 I have set the port forwarding for port 80 4444 8096 and none of them is accessible over the internet, using the domain or the my IPv4 address.
 But it is accessible in my local network using domain or the ipv4 address or using internal ip obviously.
 When i turn off the port forwarding domain and ipv4 accessibility stops workings, so i thing port forwarding is working fine its just not accessible over the internet.
 Can someone please guess what may be the problem here. It would be really helpful. (I dont wanna use any more services like ngnix etc)

 To my knowledge NinjaOne doesn't support cellphones, correct? Or tablets? Only devices that can be joined to the tenant.
 I can't find a good comparison. Can someone educate me please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peplink routers have emerged as a leading choice for businesses and individuals alike, thanks to their innovative features, reliable performance, and user-friendly interfaces. 
 One of the most distinctive features of Peplink routers is their patented SpeedFusion technology, which enables users to combine multiple internet connections for increased speed, reliability, and security. This technology allows for bandwidth bonding, seamless failover, and intelligent load balancing across different types of internet connections, such as DSL, cable, fiber, and cellular.
 I had the opportunity to choose a Peplink Balance router for multi WAN support, load balancing and failover solution, which I liked a lot, but at that time I realised that it holds a very small market niche, and it is not very popular. Peplink might not have the same level of brand recognition as some of the more prominent players in the networking industry. This could be due to a combination of factors, including limited marketing efforts, a smaller advertising budget, or the company's focus on niche markets. Consequently, many potential customers might not be aware of Peplink and its offerings.
 What's your experience with Peplink, if any?

After contacting them the answer I got was 
  
If the tool is prohibited which it seems it is, then FACEIT AC will not be able to run - this is 100% intentional. 
 Keep in mind in order to play on FACEIT you must comply with our technical requirements when it comes to FACEIT AC and we cannot make any adjustments based on individual concerns or issues.
  
and after asking the reason it is blocked
  
I'm afraid we will not disclose to you the reason behind this change for security and privacy reasons.
  
is there any vulnerability or weakness known for Process Explorer? It blocks the most recent version of it, 17.02

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a hybrid Exchange setup. Email is filtered from the Internet to our on-prem Exchange by a 3rd party email filtering service. Once email hits our internal mail servers if the recipients mailbox is in O365 the email is forwarded to O365 over a send connector. Outbound mail for on-prem users goes out through 3rd party filtering service. O365 senders mail leaves through EOP.
 I am reviewing the non-accepted domain report on the O365 Exchange admin home page and I see a large number of emails listed in this report. These emails originate from the Internet and are routed from on-prem to O365 mailboxes. I am assuming they are not being delivered but I have not heard anyone complaining yet. Unfortunately I don't have the ability to dig into the results from the report. So what I have been doing is taking the domains listed there and using message trace to track emails by the domain. I don't see anything getting blocked. Can someone explain what I am apparently missing here? Are the emails really being delivered but for some reason since it's coming from our on-prem servers they are marked as non-accepted domains? If that is the case how do I fix it?

We are looking for something to replace WASP. We looked at SolarWinds and it had autodiscovery tools for Macs but not for mobile devices which is the majority of our inventory along with Chromebooks. The API support for FS and Jamf is outdated and does not work like we want it to. It would be nice if the users and locations of our devices synced. FS does have an inventory system but we are mainly using it for Ticketing. Any ideas? Thanks!
 Edit: The way I'm hoping it will work is to have Jamf/Sccm/Google sync with the Inventory system and then sync all that information into FS through an API.

Internal VM is hosted at 1.1.1.1. Public IP address is 2.2.2.2. Routed 2.2.2.2 to point to example.com. The URL that Gophish needs to listen should be public but can't be directly set to 2.2.2.2 when creating a campaign it should be localhost(1.1.1.1). I've got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2. My goal is when a link in the email is clicked to lead to my domain example.com?rid=516313 and to open the landing page I've configured, and when the link is clicked to somehow find its way to 1.1.1.1 through 2.2.2.2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having issue with LTE routers, losing connection and not coming up. Cisco 1100 LTE routers.
 ​
 I built a EEM script that would reload the controller if SLA icmp check status goes down.
 ​
 I think it worked last night, but I'm wondering if it would loop and trigger again if the first try would not work. If the state needs to come 'up' again, in order for the script to run again. Not sure, and I would prefer it not to happen that we would again need to reboot the router manually for the connection to get back up.
 ​
 So here is the script. 
 !
 track 1 ip sla 1 reachability
 delay down 30 up 30
 !
 !
 ip sla 1
 icmp-echo 1.1.1.1 source-interface Vlan1
 ip sla schedule 1 life forever start-time now
 !
 !
 event manager applet Backup_Failover authorization bypass
 event track 1 state down
 action 2 cli command "enable"
 action 3 wait 2
 action 4 cli command "conf t"
 action 5 wait 2
 action 8 cli command "controller cellular 0/2/0"
 action 9 cli command "lte radio off"
 action 9.1 wait 10
 action 9.2 cli command "no lte radio off"
 action 9.3 cli command "exit"
 !
 ​
 **
 ​
 So it looks like it worked last night, but I would prefer it to rerun again if the state would not turn 'up' in 5 minutes or so. Wondering if that would happen? or does it loop as long as the state is 'down'?
 ​
 anyone good with eem scripting? :)

Internal VM is hosted at 1.1.1.1. Public IP address is 2.2.2.2. Routed 2.2.2.2 to point to example.com. The URL that Gophish needs to listen should be public but can't be directly set to 2.2.2.2 when creating a campaign it should be localhost(1.1.1.1). I've got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2. My goal is when a link in the email is clicked to lead to my domain example.com?rid=516313 and to open the landing page I've configured, and when the link is clicked to somehow find its way to 1.1.1.1 through 2.2.2.2. Thanks!

 Is this still an ongoing issue? Is this a bug in the newest Microsoft update?

 But the best part is, when I have created a ticket, they have told me first to check my DNS (I did), and next "they can do nothing about it", I should contact Gmail myself.
 Let me get straight: I'm paying you money and you tell me I need to do your work and fix your deliverability issues?
 That's not the first time we opened tickets. In the past months multiple times we have caught them being randomly flagged as spammers, or detecting "unexplainable relay access denied" errors in our mail.log.
 We are using exactly the same tech stack and we never saw these errors with Sendgrid.
 Is Mailgun really so bad, or I am doing something wrong?
 Honestly, at this point I'm looking for an alternative (Stripe is not an option, due to local regulation).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I saw a video about new Intel Xeons from Linus Tech Tips. My jaw dropped when he said they are going the chiplet route like AMD since I was afraid they will do that.
 Pretty much all of our clients use Oracle Standard 2 on Intel hardware for our product. We can't use AMD because if licensing. Essentially if you have an AMD Epyc with four chiplets, you need FOUR CPU LICENSES. Yes, really. Which means you would need the Enterprise edition which costs more than I want to know (ranges of tens of thousands of Euros).
 Now that Intel does the same, there are multiple options.
 a) Oracle will change their licensing (highly unlikely) to allow chiplets
 b) It will not apply to the Intel implementation (it is a bit different to AMD)
 c) We start working immediately on moving our product from Oracle
 d) Our customers will need to just buy old, pre 2023 servers. This sucks because at some point supply will dry out.

 Even if they remove an IP from their list, they seem to block another one instead...
 Also you have to enter your name and company details for every lookup or removal request. This is very annoying.
 On the Website are no contact details at all. Just on the Validity website you can fond a form to enter your contact details so a sales rep can contact you. There is not even a field to enter details or a description.

 I found that major browsers recently end the supports for ftp and most js ftp clients are in nodejs. So I'm wondering whether it is still possible to connect to ftp server using js. Any web technology that will be able to do that, like web workers, websocket, webRTC?
 If web technology is impossible to do, what are the other options? Thanks and really appreciate any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember in the olden days there used to be something called “Small Business Server.”
 We have a very small standalone site with about 20 users where they are adamant about only having one server to manage.They don’t want to virtualize it and run separate machines as VM guests either. One server only.
 However it’s not recommended to add additional roles such as print servers to domain controllers. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment-print-spooler
 Same for file server and WSUS.
 Is there any equivalent to SBS in 2023 that’s supported for running a domain controller plus other roles on the same server?
 The only thing I can think of would be to configure direct IP printing, configure updates from Windows updates online and using SharePoint Online using a spare workstation for hosting any needed local file shares for things not hosted in SharePoint Online..
 Also, at this point, they are not interested in Azure joining workstations and getting rid of the domain.

 I feel like outside of the big banks and American companies with Canadian branches, it’s slim pickings for decent paying network engineering jobs. I live in Toronto but still feel this way.

Microsoft of course is the biggest offender, but lately Veeam does it too, and likely several others.
 Edit: my complaint isn't about techs being lazy or whatever, I'm talking about the enormous gulf between marketing and support capacity

In the process, we are wanting to put a bridge between the firewall and the ISP so we can take advantage of the extra IPs in a /29 or /28 if needed. I've recommended managed switches for these locations as many of them are automated sites with no personnel. I'm getting pushback on 2 issues. Our security consultant is recommending we put in unmanaged switches. They are cheaper, they can't be compromised from the Internet (cue scary music) and if a redundant link goes out you just ship out another cheap switch. Secondly, if we did go with the managed switch option, he is insisting that the OOB mgmt port doesn't plug into our trusted network but instead goes through the firewall. Apparently plugging it straight into the trusted network would immediately cause a security audit to fail. Thoughts on these 2 items?

Aside from society generally going off the rails lately I feel lately that I am living in the twilight zone of horrible customer support. It is just not one vendor but most. They all seem to be relying on chat support and extremely inept level 1 support people. And the quality of support is really horrible. Maybe I am getting old but there seems to be a massive sea change happening lately that is not good. It feels all wrong to be honest and makes me truly worry about the next 3-5 years. This is nothing specific about a specific vendor but just an overall feeling. 
 Maybe it is just me.

 My device is a Juniper SRX1500.
 I think this suggests a L1 issue so need to check patches/crossconnects, but just wanted to specifically ask if an SFP port can take a Dual-Rate SFP+ transceiver.

 From the research we have done, it does not seem apparent that there is a great solution to the documentation of the specifics of what is patched where, but rather focusing on identifying what device is connected, etc. 
 We are using Cisco switches. Any advice for what I could further look into, or what tools you all use, for tracking and documenting patches?

 I get frustrated because, for the most part, I get to spend about 15 mins thinking through something and then something else pops up. I feel like this has a negative effect on my career and my ability to focus. And I'm developing a habit of not focusing on one thing for long periods of time. I've had a coworker that was diagnosed with ADHD said he thought I may have it, but I've never investigated it more than speaking with him about it.
 Do any of you feel like you have limited time to think through something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are quoting a customer to move from direct Microsoft Enterprise Agreement to our CSP/MSP. I tried posting in the MSP sub and didn't get any replies. Today they have a line item for a product called "Exchange Online P1 SU Exchange Online Kiosk Per User" with SKU "TRA-00065". This customer is not government and insist that Microsoft agrees this is OK for them to use. This product is confusing as they should not exist on the same line regardless. At a high level, Exchange OnLine kiosk has 2gb, EOL plan 1 has 50gb, and EOL plan 2 has 100gb. I googled and found this same product name and SKU in the wild for several government entities, such as https://www.coquitlam.ca/DocumentCenter/View/9568/23-036-RFIQ---Microsoft-Enterprise-Agreement-Renewal-and-Software-License-Management?bidId=
 The goal of this product was to increase their F3s to have 50GB inboxes, which aligns to Exchange Online Plan 1. I am unable to compete as they are paying almost $1 for this product. Has anyone run into this before or can otherwise decode why/how kiosk and plan1 are combined into one product? Any other thoughts appreciated!

Obviously, pay was not good but I reckon that the mental stability that the job overall provided was much more important. Almost everyone came from a private background too, so they knew what a golden job they had gotten. 
 The things I do in one day at my current job by myself, it was done in weeks with a team, if not months (some minor upgrades, or deployments for example). The slower pace of the job actually benefitted everyone’s mental and physical health, and people seemed happier for a fact. Anyways, I’m nearly mentally drained and I hope to get back in the public sector hopefully sooner than later

 Basically, I have a .csv of users and devices and I want to send out hardware acknowledgements to each of them, where they can either sign or approve. 
 I have tried Power Automate, Microsoft Word (mail merge) and now Adobe Sign to no avail. 
 Are you guys still doing paper forms, or how are you handling deploying new hardware and having users sign off on it?

 I'm relatively young in the IT space. Started my first real job around the XP end of life. It seems like every OS update, Microsoft takes away all the functional shit real IT people would use, then slowly just adds it all back over the next 2 to 3 years. Then after that it's acceptable and that's when I switch. Same story with 10 and 8. 
 It's crazy this multi billion dollar company goes through the same cycle every time. Why? Just my morning shower thought.

 Is there any way to only allow 365 phishing protection to continue to work via a mail flow rule or similar, with Barracuda in place? I had notifications turned on each time a phishing email was allowed by override, that's how I found out this was happening. Barracuda doesn't seem to be doing a very good job with these, also have their impersonation protection which also kind of sucks.

 The trick is I cannot install anything on the laptop the vendor needs access too. All solutions seem to need that agent. 
 The only glimmer I have found is Teams allows this with Edge, one day, but not yet. 
 So I am looking for any solutions you have run across that would require no agent installs, on the laptop and allow in remote access to keyboard in a pretty restrictive environment. Think DOD kind of restrictive. 
 Webex, Chrome Remote Desktop, Bomgar all are out as they require agents and installs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a windows application that is currently running on 2000+ computers and we are searching for a simple tool that could handle deployment for us.
 The machine on which the application is running is set up using ansible which works great. After the setup is completed, we install and update our application using psexec.
 Psexec is quite terrible because we have to push a new version of the application and handle problems with machines that are offline.
 I'm one of the developers of the application and we are currently trying to find a tool that would help us update the application and potentially take care of restarting it in the case of an error. I would guess that there must be many tools specifically designed for this kind of problem but I cannot find anything.
 Note that I'm not searching for a tool that can manage and install all the applications on the machine (Azure Intune, PDQDeploy). That is the job of our infrastructure team and I don't want to invade their work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I've been always struggling with doing on-call duty. No matter how hard I try I always get overwhelmed with alerting software and prioritization of incidents. I can't keep my focus level consistent for the 8-9 hours duration of the shift. My ADHD definitely does not help with that either.
 Can someone recommend me some resources on becoming a better on-call engineer? How to prioritize better, how to handle incidents and not getting overwhelmed all the time with the alerts or errors thrown at me by Icinga or any other monitoring tool.
 Probably the easiest way would be to renegotiate the terms of the contract, so I wouldn't be put in an on-call rotation, but honestly for me that feels like being not fully qualified to do my job and makes my impostor syndrome kick me even harder.
 Do you guys have any suggestions for me?

I don't think I should remove the CA role from the sub CA. First time setup so I appreciate any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm walking the dog this morning thinking about how much time I waste thinking about incoming packages and where they go and if they were used and did the customer ultimately end up getting billed for the part.
 The ticketing system does not handle this well and spreadsheets are a mess. I absolutely hate using access because it is not in the cloud but it does everything I need as a single person, and in less than an hour I can go to database that will show me a dashboard of what I want to know and generate reports.
 I know there's so many cloud options right now but every time I try something new there's something that is not quite straight forward and takes more time to figure out and just leaning on my old trusty Microsoft Access skills. I wish I had time to learn as there are so many cool cloud tools these days, and sure if a customer is interested in a specific product I will learn everything about it and become an expert in it. In this case I'm falling back on access because I've already spent too much time dabbling in Microsoft Teams, messing around with building a small ticketing system within to organize tracking packages. When it comes to learning more for the sake of non-tangible endeavors it is often put on the back burner.
 And I'm not wasting time posting this because I can walk my dog and ponder at the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently discovered that Exchange Online transport rules, which includes mailbox forwarding configurations, forwards messages before EOP content filtering. The design decision overall makes sense, it’s just not optimal for some use cases. The end-result for forwarding to third-party systems, like Zendesk, is that messages flagged as phishing still get forwarded to the external system because the forward occurs before the content filtering by design. Some of these third-party systems have far less sophisticated content filtering that EOP.
 Short of implementing a legacy-style content filter, where you change your MX records, in front of our entire exchange environment, any ideas on how to forward messages after content filtering? We are also open to paid services as part of a solution, if there isn’t a good way to do it in the native Exchange Online platform.

 I'm new to the job and in charge of the ERP side of applications and so there's an MSP whose been here years and stays for back ups and such. I'm also responsible for them. This works since it gives me time to focus on business applications kind of thing and avoids 2am phone calls.
 The company has always bought the M365 licenses through the MSP and I'm not too cool with this. I am thinking we shouldn't be tied to them like this. I am looking at Dell as a license reseller, they are cheaper too. Naturally the MSP has all sorts of issues with this.
 Do you all prefer to be more provider/vendor agnostic? What do you think on this topic?

 ​
 I need to do a project for school and wanted to set up a WDS because we also need one at my company. 
 ​
 I'm completely new to this and only knew about WDS but today I saw an article about MDT and that I should use this instead of WDS for creating the imagen using WDS only for the PXE boot.
 ​
 We have many different clients ranging from Lawyers to construction companies. I wanted to create an image for every company and boot via PXE so that I only have to choose an image and then the PC should install and set up everything by itself (programs, settings, domain, pc-name, etc). The user should only log in and start working.
 ​
 My questions are:
 ​
 -is that possible?
 ​
 -what exactly are the differences between the two? Why should I use MDT over WDS?
 ​
 -what would be the best way to set that up?
 ​
 -does that work wih Windows 11 images?
 ​
 -do you know some good up-to-date articles I could use?

 With CVE-2023-23397, the attacker sends a message with an extended MAPI-property with a UNC-path to a SMB-share on the attacker-controlled server. No user interaction is required. The exploitation can be triggered as soon as the client receives the email.
 The connection to the remote SMB-server sends the user's NTLM negotiation message, which will leak the NTLM hash of the victim to the attacker who can then relay this for authentication against other systems as the victim.
 Exploitation has been seen in the wild.
 This should be patched in the latest release but if needed, the following workarounds are available:
  
Add users to the Protected Users Security Group. This prevents the use of NTLM as an authentication mechanism. NOTE: this may cause impact to applications that require NTLM. 
 Block TCP 445/SMB outbound form your network by using a Firewall and via your VPN settings. This will prevent the sending of NTLM authentication messages to remote file shares.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider a scenario where there is a pair of SANs that are replication partners with each other. Both are populated with FIPS 140-2 validated self encrypting drives so data at rest is encrypted. When one array does block level replication to the other array, does the data remain encrypted while in transit? 
 My assumption is yes since there's no need for block level replication to understand any of the file contents in order to function. So it's just sending 4K chunks of previously encrypted 1s and 0s over the network. 
 Can one of you experts help enlighten me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning have become increasingly important in practically every aspect of our lives. Based on these technologies, there are also promising identity and access control strategies. But what function do they truly play in identity and access management?
 The use of artificial intelligence to find anomalies in user behavior is one strategy being studied in this context. Algorithms examine user activity within a system and spot any unexpected behaviors that might point to a security problem. In this approach, possible assaults can be discovered and countered at an early stage.
 In the area of authentication, there are also interesting methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Systems that examine a user's voice or behavior to confirm their identification are one example of this. With no further user action required, high security authentication can be accomplished in this way.
 The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in identity and access management is, however, being questioned by certain critics. One explanation for this is the possibility of faults with these technology. Users may be mistakenly blocked or unauthorized users may obtain access to secured systems as a result of a flawed system.
 How do you feel? What role do artificial intelligence and machine learning play in identity and access management? Are they a risk or a promising technology? What strategies are already in use, and where do you see room for advancement?

 https://i.imgur.com/5OKifdA.jpg
 https://i.imgur.com/dA6U0St.jpg
 Background: i am working for an IT company. To be able to install email app and other company related apps that are in Microsoft, I need to install this profile in my phone.
 I read the privacy fine prints before installation.
 It says, if this is company smartphone, company will know all apps I installed and has full control
 If its “personal smartphone”, which is in my case, they can only manage company-related apps that are installed thru company portal and will not have access on my photos and other apps on my phone. But they have access to the info about my phone (model, serial number etc)
 So I understood the difference, however upon checking the Manage Profile itself, which in the photo above, it seems that its more than that. It feels like i am giving the full control of my phone.
 I wanna ask network administrators here what can you really see when someone installed company portal and installed this kind of management profile on their phones.
 I understood by definition (at least the info they disclosed) the limit of what can be accessed but i would also like to know how possible it is to get all information (photos in cloud, list of all apps installed etc.) if a company network administrator will intentionally try to access everything using the management profile installed.

 Currently we (SP) are planning IPv6 support for our customers. Currently we are running an IPv4-only MPLS core and connecting customers using L3VPN blah. blah. After researching it seems there are 2 possible methods, either keeping it easy and keep running IPv4 core and implementing 6VPE or Dual stacking the core and run IPv6 with SRv6 while keeping IPv4 next to it. The 2nd one looks like such an headache as we do not have segment routing implemented in our IPv4 core but looks more futureproof.
 Is the 2nd option even plausible? and if it is could anyone here with some more experience in usage tell me why "you" would choose one over the other? Thanks!

 i am studying self encrypting drives, and a functionality is to only use the dek function without an external password or Auth Key...but i am a bit confused...what is usable for security if leave only dek enabled ?
 this article says...
 https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/self-encrypting-drives
 " We know what you're thinking. If your data isn't being fully protected, then what's the point of even buying an SED? Does this mean that an SED can be hacked?
 Well, given that SEDs encrypt your data and store its DEK internally, you're still being protected from common software-level attacks that seek to steal, alter, or delete your most sensitive data. "
 dont get it...what protection can give me a basic dek only based sed disk?
 thank you

 I'm trying to run WordPress in a clustered setup on a 3 node Docker Swarm cluster and a MariaDB Galera cluster. However, the servers I'm using are very small and don't have a lot of RAM/CPU.
 I've tried using Gluster and Ceph to sync or distribute WordPress files between the servers, but it resulted in website response times that were 10x longer. As a result, I'm currently using Syncthing to sync the mounted folder between the servers since it doesn't impact read performance.
 I was wondering if anyone had any advice on a better way to set this up given the limited resources of the servers. Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm having an issue with some users.
 We are using Exchange Servers, and Outlook client for Windows.
 Sometimes, we have to remove users from our AD, since they are leaving the company. Our AD is synced to the Exchange Servers, and so, if the account is deleted, everything linked is deleted too.
 BUT, in the Outlook client, if someone still has the calendar from the deleted user, in his shared calendars, then Outlook will keep trying to connect to this calendar, then prompt the user for a password, and eventually not sync his Outlook anymore because it can't load this specific removed calendar.
 Is there anyway to monitor this ? Some users have +50 loaded calendars, and finding deleted ones is kinda messy... I don't know, that's why I'm asking. :)

 All holy hell broke loose when i released the update FSLogix 2210 (2.9.8361.52326), we were getting a black screen for users on logon, but as this was a managed change, we did this first in a test environment. However this consists of 15 users to ensure full testing complete. (Barring in mind they are 500+ users strong) 
 Well after much deliberation, i came across this fix through Microsoft forums! god forbid it took me 2 days after they posted it, to find it!

 I know for a fact that Edgeswitch devices, while they can't pack Q-in-Q and on paper do not support Q-in-Q. However if you pack the Q-in-Q on two other devices that support Q-in-Q, a Edgeswitch will happily transport the Q-in-Q without issues.

 I'm trying to get all the tickets from our company's SupportPal and import it all into PowerBI in order to make an easy to understand Dashboard, 
 I'm not having any luck trying to figure it out on my own and i'm quite new to this job as well as PowerBi, 
 Any and all tips would be appreciated, 
 Thank you very much.

 Can't share everything, but I have probably over the past few months called them a few dozen times for issues with their garbage products and terrible service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not getting much traction in the Intune subreddit
 ​
 I have 5 users out of 2000 on Full Azure AD with never ending issues. Intune isn't Enterprise grade yet, but we are being forced to go to it due to Microsoft removing features or making legacy onprem features hard to manage going forward or not adding new features.
 The next low hanging fruit on the issue tracker is Wi-Fi.
 We have 3 Wi-Fi networks.
  
CompanyWifi
 CompanyGuest
 CompanyBYOD
  
How can I block using Intune the ability to connect or see CompanyGuest and CompanyBYOD
 In GPO I just create the profile and add the guest and BYOD to blocked list and click don't view blocked wireless networks. I know it works because I have it right now working.
 Even with the CORP profile deployed via Intune it doesn't automatically reconnect sometimes and they just see the CompanyNameGUEST and assume its correct. As the GUEST password is on the board room they can connect. 
 They then create support tickets saying network shares, apps and things aren't working. The Guest and BYOD are on different VLANS and are blocked from accessing internal resources. I have told them not to connect to Guest or BYOD but ignore me. 
 We have had 25 cases so far this year just from the 5 Full Azure AD users regarding Wi-Fi and not able to access stuff and us finding they are on the wrong Wi-Fi. If we extrapolate that over 1000 odd users, we will get a shit load of tickets.
 This was such a simple thing in Group Policy but looks like moving to Intune and the Modern way is costing us more time for support and costing more money as we now need to licence everything and loosing essential features.

 What is the best way to back it up so that I can see if I can get the software for the machine to run in vdos or dosbox? I don't have an idea drive to plug in and use the backup tool in dos. Though does that back up the whole file system and os like a clone, or does it just back up the files?
 I have a star tech USB to IDE reader and have taken the drive and plugged it into win 11 hoping to use macrium and image it. To my chagrin, and what I should have realized, is I guess win 11 will not read fat16 and it says it's a 2tb drive that needs to be initialized. Obviously that would wipe the data so that wouldn't work.
 Tldr: Need to backup and old dos 6.2 machine and realized that win 11 wouldn't read the data. Pls help. I'm assuming linux would do it, but am unsure how.

 I have a Supermicro server with 24 bays and almost exactly half of the drives don't work. From the RAID card BIOS they read as 0/00 size, and the card refuses to pass them through to the OS. I've even tried them in my personal rig (LSI-9750) and it spits out a "Not supported" error. I've tried the drives in 3 different servers, with 4 different RAID cards and I'm at a loss here.
 I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone has had something similar. The most I've found is incompatibility with 520 byte formatted drives but I'm at a loss here.
 Let me know what you all think, I can post pictures as well if needed.

 Our IT team is a helpdesk of 4, 3 system and network admins.
 We've got a lot of systems. On top of your basic infrastructure (AD domain controllers, wired network, wireless network, storage servers, virtualization servers, backup and replication, firewall, etc. etc.) we're also managing, Microsoft 365 tenant (Azure AD, SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive etc. Loads of admin work with no one dedicated to looking after it all), two MDM platforms for all devices (Jamf for Mac, InTune for Windows machines, again without a dedicated person to look after it), logging and monitoring system, cyber security, and countless other systems and infra that seems to just be growing.
 What's it like in your organization? Is there someone who's role is to look after specific components of IT, or at least an SME for each component? For a while now it's just felt like help desk is running around mad trying to put out fires (users who can't connect, machines that dont have correct software, incorrect permissions, general computer issues, etc.) And then the system and network admins just get dragged into helping, meaning that any project work (and there's a lot) is borderline impossible to devote attention to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having trouble with a laptop wireless connection to an Epson projector. Originally, both the laptop and projector were connected to the office network over the same ssid at the main router. The projector is assigned a static IP address, which allows the laptop to connect to it over the router. However, something is causing a huge amount of lag in the connection. The router appears to be working fine for all other devices, however for the projector connection there is tremendous lag at times. My solution for this was to purchase a wireless access point. So now I am trying to connect the projector to the network through the access point (with a different ssid) while the laptop remains on the main ssid. In this configuration the laptop cannot find the projector. The projector successfully connects to the network with its static IP, however on the laptop side it can’t be found. I thought that as long as the projector IP remained the same, it would not matter how the projector connects to the network for it to communicate with the laptop. What am I missing?

 Also just to provide clarity we test with 1 ICMP per 60 seconds, nothing terribly overwhelming, I wouldn't imagine we'd hit any kind of DDOS threshold.

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

 I’m hoping someone can guide me in the right direction as we’ve hit a bit of a brick wall.
 We’re using Apple Business Manager & MDM (Microsoft Intune). Within Microsoft Intune we have blocked access for syncing, Apple ID’s and iCloud for regulatory reasons.
 I’ve been asked how to get contacts from an Android device onto an iPhone device, however, after looking almost everywhere it’s either a case of it needing some form of Apple ID/iCloud, it not supporting MDM devices, or it being a contact-by-contact process, which isn’t scalable.
 Does anyone have any form of alternatives?
 Kind Regards,
 Max

 Does fiber just use a different port for printing?

 I'm out of options here, so I'd love to pick some brains from people who are wiser than me here. Has anyone else noticed the atrocious behavior of M365 Apps, specifically Outlook, on the Dell Latitude 3500's? I've had anything from the application simply not opening, to it disconnecting from exchange, and other spontaneous issues. Everything stays up to date and it seems to only affect our 3500's, not our Latitude 5000's. The only way solutions I've found are rebuilding the Outlook profile, M365 repairs, and if all else fails a user profile rebuild. 
 I don't mind doing my job and fixing these issues, but it's getting to the point where I'm just genuinely having my time wasted with users having the same Outlook issues over and over again. Hell, I've even completely wiped and redeployed a machine and that same issue happened again. Microsoft has been no help and recent updates have done nothing. 
 This is such a simple tier I/II issue that I'm genuinely just getting my time wasted on. I'm tired of running a repair or rebuild every two weeks.
 So, basically, have you guys encountered this? If so, have you found any other reliable fixes?
 Also, if you think I should copy this to another sub Reddit, let me know.

 If it goes wrong you don't have to do an AD authoritative restore, just a regular one. If it runs into issues the pressure is off to resolve them. Depending on size of forest it's could be more than 1 day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had an issue last week after installing the February 2023 update (KB502289) on 4 separate devices running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 that I wanted to pass along, because I haven't been able to find any similar issues out there.
 I believe this actually began back in October/November when we started seeing daily incidences of NETLOGON error 5719 (that we only noticed now, in hindsight). A couple of days after installing KB502289, users complained about data shares not being accessible. We noticed that the ACLs on each server weren't listing domain members, and that led to figuring out that the secure channel/trust relationship was now broken on each of these servers.
 Tried multiple fixes including:
  
rolling back update KB502289
 Secure Channel repair
 domain unjoin/rejoin
  
None worked, and we ended up just moving the data off of the servers (as we had planned to retire them later this year anyway) and re-creating the shares. We're still not 100% certain how this could have been remedied if we were forced to keep the servers in production.
 I'm fairly certain that this issue was caused in some part due to Netlogon protocol changes/hardening but I can't prove it, and I'm somewhat concerned about how this could end up affecting other servers in our enterprise further down the line. I know this Netlogon hardening is considered a KABOOM so I've been trying to mitigate against issues, but wasn't anticipating this one.

I would like to have my own VPN server on each site, that allows my computer to connect to each site, on demand (not an always-on system) but have it in a reverse connection fashion (so the client does not need to setup port forwarding and IP assignments on their public interface).
 ​
 I was looking into OpenVPN appliance, with a reverse connection policy.

 Has anybody had a similar scenario they needed to achieve? Thank you for any replies with help.

The reality is that they don't want to carry a laptop to and from the office so they leave a laptop at home where it never goes online to get application and security updates. Their defense is that they don't want employees leaving them in cars on days they don't go straight home. They all have Bitlocker enabled and we live in Virginia, it doesn't get that hot to melt the laptop. How do you guys handle this?

I tried to make a dynamic route between the devices' fiber ports but somehow it wont work. Logs are flapping between exchange and down and the reason is too many transmissions. I searched in the internet and the solution I only find is MTU mismatch or MTU misconfig. I tried to fix this problem but the adjacency still doesnt form and logs are still flapping between exchange and down. What do you think is the reason behind this? This is my first time handling inter-vendor routing. Thank you.

 Approached by a recruiter based in the UK, who found me on a business related social media site. 
 Agreed to talk about the offer: company/role/wage etc. Company is local to me (not UK)
 After our talk he sen't me an e-mail wanting me to reply by copy-pasting a text he appended:
 "I, {my name} confirm that {recruiter name} of {recruiter company} has discussed the role of {job title} at {company they want to refer me to} and confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative.
 I understand {recruiter company} are passing my basic details and CV to {company they want to refer me to} on my behalf and are doing so with my express agreement. The Data Privacy and Retention Policy of {company they want to refer me to} is available from {link to company they want to refer me to} {company they want to refer me to}."
 ​
  
The "confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative" + no time limit for how long is fishy to me. If it were only for the company he's selling me to, I wouldn't really mind though.
 But is it really meant that way? What if I don't accept the role? Would I need to terminate the contract with him/them being my sole representative?
 The link goes to the homepage of {company they want to refer me to}, where I couldn't find the Data Retention Policy. I can understand why they need to refer to the {company they want to refer me to}'s Data Retention policy, since they send my CV over, but wouldn't it make more sense to link to the {recruiter company} Data Privacy and Retention Policy? Or both?
  
Is this BS? Am I being overly cautious? 
 Thank you

 As far as RAM and processing power, to have a enterprise environment running with switches , routers, firewall and clients. That should be more than enough RAM to push through?
 I know it depends on how large the environment is , but realistically just to have enough power for run at least a moderate enterprise environment with the listed above?

We have a request from a client to find a solution that does BOTH patch management (Microsoft patches but also 3rd party apps patches) and vulnerability scanning for about 500 pcs. So far the only thing that I could find that does these things is Languard, but after a few days of testing the trial I'm not confident to recommend this. It's very slow, freezes a lot, agent deployment does not work 99% of the time, looks very dated, etc.
 I really liked Rapid 7's Insight VM for vulnerability assessment but this doesn't do patch management and the client doesn't want 2 sepparate apps... There's also Qualys that would work and I like it, but they have huge prices, it's enterprise level solution.
 So, in a nutshell, do you know of any solution that can do what I need and doesn't cost my weight in gold? 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 I discovered Z-push a while ago, in every documentation I find it talks about integration with Zimbra. 
 ​
 In my case I have a server with Directadmin and exim with more than 10k mail accounts running and I would like to know if it can be integrated with my system without having to migrate everything to Zimbra.
 ​
 I also have a CalDav and CardDav server running, so I understand that it could be configured for z-push to use both servers.
 ​
 Thanks in advance

January people complain about not beeing able to share their screen. This only happens solely on Surface pro 7. You plug in the usb dongle, click the .exe on the usb share but nothing happens.
 Funny sidenote: it works with all guest devices, it works with our lenovo notebooks, it works with surface book 2, only about 30 Surface Pro 7 dont work.
 We use CS-100 and CS-200 and appropiate Clickshare Buttons, all on the latest firmware.Windows Version is 20H2, soon 22H2 on all machines, also no GPO that prevents USB since it works on all other devices. We are really struggling atm - no eventlog nor barco log show problems. We tried deleting local profiles, we downgraded firmware...
 Does anyone experience the same?

 All our users have a laptop with always on vpn. We split tunnel some stuff like teams/onedrive to not kill our internet connection. Normal web traffic goes trough the vpn and firewall rules.
 Lately we are detecting large amount of traffic from alot of windows 10 laptops to some ip bloks. Mostly 8.238.22.x, 8.238.23.x, 8.238.177.x, 8.238.179.x and 152.199.21.x ranges. It show as port 80 webtraffic and they are big data blocks and causes our internet connection to clog up. Also we are europe based and the ip blocks seem to be from usa. (nsa stop spying!!! :p ) We can kill it with firewall rules but we need to get to the source of this.
 Stuf we tried/considerd.
  
It all started pretty much at the same time and only are win10 laptops.
 Checked if we missed ip block update from microsoft but that is not the case.
 Tried to find something about the ip's but can not find anything more than Level 3 communications.
 Ran malware bytes on laptops confirmed they had this problem and nothing found
 When a range is blocked at some point the laptop stops trying to connect.
  
Anny and all tips would be very welcome. At the moment I am trying to get my hands on a laptop that showing this so i can try to see if I can get the proces with netstat but at the moment no luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the longest time I have been terrible at linking a title with something - this goes for anything, examples such as:
 - Names for people
 - Titles for subjects
 - Area names like street names, site areas, ect...
 I am generally quite intelligent and managed to get by with this limitation as although I struggle with the titles, the knowledge I pick up quite quickly. However, as an IT apprentice this has been effecting me more and more, especially for my portfolio.
 For my portfolio I have to fill out a KSB table (Knowledge Skills and Behaviours) where I have met each topic, e.g. applying the appropriate skills/techniques for secure working. Every time I go to look at it I feel a little overwhelmed and not sure where to start due to this weakness. 
 Moreover, when providing on site support, as I am first/second line support, it can be difficult for me knowing where things are. Although I know where users are as I have learned their names after being there a while, if someone says one of the clock in machines isn't working I have to get them to describe where rather than just saying the area name.
 I wasn't entirely sure where on reddit to ask this, so if there is a better place please advise me :) However, I thought this would be a good place as my issues are effecting my ability in my career and I am sure someone else has likely experienced this.

 ​
 So I'm looking into an issue with a few surface pro 9s where the on screen keyboard doesn't auto appear even when there's no typercover or keyboard attached. It doesn't even seem to detect tablet mode. I've tried playing about with all the settings that should enable the touch keyboard but don't know what else to try. 
 ​
 Has anyone had this issue before and managed to fix it? The machines were built with SCCM so maybe it could be an issue with the image, GPOs or something in the task sequence.

 Vulnerability :
 ​
 Description 
 ​
 When non-privileged users can link GPOs at the Domain Controllers OU level, they havetheability to effect change on domain controllers as well as potentially elevate access and change domain-wide security posture. This indicator looks for non-default principals who have write permissions on the GPLink attribute or Write DACL/Write Owner on the object. Likelihood of Compromise Just being able to link GPOs doesn't provide the whole picture. An attacker would need to find or edit a GPO that contains the instructions they want to achieve. However, i fan attacker can find an existing GPO that meets their needs, then having this write permission gives them thekeys to the kingdom. Result Found 1 objects with write permissions on the GPLink attributeat the Domain Controller OU level.

I thought that if I try to install the 2022-01 monthly rollup patch, it will give an error that says "update not applicable" since a latest monthly rollup patch is already installed - but for some reason it did not and I was still able to install the old patch.

 Would there be any changes in terms of security by installing a much older patch? I now wonder what changes would there be by installing an older patch?

 I've got my SC-200 this Friday, previously attempted it and failed by 1 or 2 marks, I got 684 and needed 700 :(
 ​
 Work gave me a 2nd exam voucher and I realised we also have access to measure-up for free so I've been going through the 117 Qs they have but am I better using exam dumps? Measure-up offer money back guarantees if you can hit 90% in succession (confident I can do this easily with practice) but would I be better spending my time on the exam dumps instead? 
 For dumps my colleague recommended Prof-IT (work subsidised buying this so I have access to both options).
 Overall I find Measure-up better personally in terms of interaction/gui/features.
 ​
 Any thoughts welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi 
 We are a small MSP who seem to run into problems, when we are experiencing more complicated issues with our customers' different copiers. These are issues that seems to relate to their drivers and the interaction with the rest of the network/print server ecosystem. 
 Our experience when contacting the different Copier/Printer suppliers is mostly rejections saying that the issue is with our systems - e.g. once we had a technician connect a laptop directly to the ethernet port on a copier, print a page and conclude that there was not a problem printing to their device. While I can understand the technician's point of view, in regards to his domain with technical support of the copier itself, I am guessing it is fairly few organizations who buy a copier for one person to connect directly to it via ethernet cable.
 Other times they will say we can only use one specific driver without further explanation, even though their own company supplies both Universal and PCL and PS variants.
 We try of course to be diligent in our testing and problem solving, but when we cannot find fault in our systems, we need somebody to turn to. It seems it is very hard to get the suppliers of Copiers/Printers to take what seems to be issues with their drivers and the interaction with other IT systems seriously?
 So I am asking for advice on how you handle issues with copiers, where you have tested different configurations in regards to network, server setup and drivers with no luck
  
Do you buy special support from the copier/printer manufacturers?
 Do you have a secret hotline?
 Any other tips?
  
Thank you!

Can I set it up on the local roundcube?
 So e.g. the local Sieve in manageing the filter option if set up in roundcube, like thunderbird would do it? 
 Currently I just get a timeout or couldn't connect to managedSieve server and I wonder if this is even possible or not.

 -VLAN 100 with a DHCP scope with 8h lease time
 -VLAN 200 with a DHCP scope with 8h lease time
 -Accesspoint in bridge mode with ~ 30 clients on a switch port with untagged VLAN 100
 ​
 -> The AP is putting clients in the VLAN 100 where they get a DHCP address. So far so good.
 -> When I change the vlan to VLAN 200 untagged on the switch port, all clients immediatly ask for a new DHCP address and get an address in the VLAN 200 DHCP scope. 
 -> My questions are: Why is this the case? The lease time is 8 hours, so shouldn't the clients at least keep the address for 4h before asking for a new one? Or has this something to do with the clients not being able to reach their gateway in VLAN 100 anymore and therefore asking for a new address?

 ​
 As I understand, it is entirely possible to configure on-premise only WHFB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-cert-trust-adfs
 ​
 My question is -
  
Once I enable ADFS as the CRA, and configure DNS for device registration - who/which devices will be prompted to register?
 Can I allow/enforce registration only for domain-joined devices, and all other devices will just authenticate as usual without using WHFB?
  
​
 I'm trying to 'allow' WHFB in my organization, but not to 'enforce it'.
 Because not everyone who will authenticate against my ADFS are using a domain-joined laptop.
 We want to allow WFHB for domain-joined corporate devices, while those logging in from their personal devices (non-domain joined or even joined to someone else's AAD) are not prompted to register (since the registration would fail, as we are on-prem only).
 ​
 i.e. if you try to access https://intranet from a domain device, you are prompted to register/use WHFB
 if you try to access https://intranet from a personal non-domain device, you are not prompted to register and can just use 'regular login'

Does anybody know if it makes a difference when installing Admin by request, if the end user is a local admin or not? Does the software still work the same in either case or should I make all users either standard or local admin first before installing?
 EDIT: I have just thought why my question does make sense
 I was told to install the software onto my domain laptops in a kind of monitoring mode before enabling 'Require Approval = ON', but if that then makes all my standard users local admins this is not good.
 So, if Admin by request is installed on to a stanadrd users account and I then leave it in moniotor mode, which is,
 Allow run as admin = on
 Require Approval = off
 Does this kind of make all standard users local admin users until approval is enabled?

Most of what I do is user account management, a little data center support, exchange 2010, shared drive access management, airwatch/WS1, and some other light system duties. I am very interested in endpoint engineering with O365, Intune, SCCM, Exchange Online, and Azure.
 I have done some work in O365 and Intune from a help desk role a couple jobs ago. My current company will be migrating to O365 later this year, with me being part of the migration.
 A friend recommended a powershell book and I started building scripts for some exchange tasks.
 I haven't used SCCM itself, I used KACE and Empirum. I reached out to one of the engineers to show me SCCM and she's going to let me shadow her for software packaging and pushes.
 Besides just shadowing others, what are some resources I can watch, learn, and do myself to get a jump start? My job has plenty of downtime and I want to fill that time to learn more things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the new network engineer for a certain company, I have inherited some...less than stellar network design choices. Regarding TACACS, I have had to make due with what's available until new equipment arrives. In the interim, I am trying to do some AAA implementation and getting hung up on a specific set of commands I'd like to restrict if possible.
 I am trying to restrict the Tier 1 techs in a way that allows them to manipulate a VLAN's tagged/untagged ports, but there are other commands under "vlan" I'd like for them to not be able to access. So, to add a port to, say VLAN 10, as untagged it would look like this:
 switch(config)# vlan 10 untagged ethernet 16 
 The problem is, it seems that I can only either allow no access to the "vlan" command tree or allow all. I say that because I do not know and have not been able to find a way to tell TACACS to allow the user access to the list of VLANs (since they are user defined) or the port number. I've tried using an asterisk after the "vlan" entry like so:
 vlan * untagged ethernet * 
 And other variations of this, but nothing has seemed to work. If anyone has any advice I'd greatly appreciate it, I would prefer not to have to give them access to the whole "vlan" command tree.

Zone A will house ICS, Zone B will house servers and Zone C will house users. Currently I have 2 domain controllers that mirror each other on the flat network. A handful of users will need to authenticate across all 3 zones.
 What should I do with the domain controller to keep it secure. Should I keep it in the user zone and place read-only DCs in the other zones? Should I keep it the servers zone and setup DCs in the 2 other zones with one-way trusts? Should I setup stand alone DCs in all 3 zones and create those user accounts accounts the 3 DCs? My paranoia is that if my one DC gets compromised then users can't log into the 3 zones. My ICS zone needs to be the most secure.

 i work in IT support of a Company with around 4500 employees - the default Smartphones we hand out are Samsung A53s 5G.
 So recently an employee left the company and we got a like-new A53 with Android 13 back to hand out to the next user.
 He did a factory reset but didnt remove his google account - so we cant access the device. Even a factory reset via recovery mode doesnt help. The phone always ask's for the last registered google acc.
 Does anyone of you have an idea how to bypass Samsung's FRP? I would prefer solutions without sussy external software.
 I saw some youtube videos how a guy accessed bixby with talkback (Android 12). Via bixby you can access some stuff like browser or settings... but it seems like this has been fixed with Android 13 - i at least could not make it work.
 Thanks for your ideas/solutions!

I am also concerned because from an compliance standpoint, Zabbix is internationally headquartered. As an ISP, is it safe/reasonable to implement a foreign, open-source network management tool?
 On that note, does anyone have any experience with a tool that would allow for automation, security monitoring, and data logging for an ISP network? As we may move away from Calix equipment in the future, interoperability and accessibility are important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Left my SysAdmin job last year for burnout. A colleague who went on to become CTO of an ecomm company reached out in Feb to check in on me and see if I was open to some contract work. 
 I’m sick of spending my savings so I said yes. 
 Essentially, they fired their old head of ops because of a massive crash around Valentine’s Day. 
 The CTO wants me to come in and basically rebuild the department in the image of the company where we worked at together. 
 There’s 2 other junior IT people I’ll have at my disposal who I will be training up. 
 If everything goes good, there’s the potential to stay on or if I don’t want to, the pay will allow me to take some more time off. 
 Any tips on scoping this out and making good? Mistakes to avoid?

Currently we have two campuses linked together by a Siklu Etherhaul Wireless device (spec'd at 1gbps but really we get around 600mbps). We are a few days away from commissioning a new leased fibre circuit(using Openreach here in the UK) at 1gbps. We use this kind of site to site link in several location and we will be getting the full 1gbps throughput. I want to be in a position where by default, the switches will use the more reliable and higher bandwidth fibre link, not the WiFi.
 My concern is that by default, spanning tree will look at the two options for routing the traffic, see that they are both technically advertised as 1000mbps and just decide to use the WiFi.
 Can anyone advise how I can forcefully set the fibre link as the default in SPT?

From November 2022 through early January 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and authoring organizations identified the presence of indicators of compromise (IOCs) at a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency. Analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors, including an APT actor, were able to exploit a .NET deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in Progress Telerik user interface (UI) for ASP.NET AJAX, located in the agency’s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for remote code execution. According to Progress Software, Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX builds before R1 2020 (2020.1.114) are vulnerable to this exploit.[1]

 2 firewalls, yes I know. One is for a 2nd company that needs traffic as separate as possible from the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a question on how acceptable this is. I have a property where all of the inner vlan routing is done at the firewall level, the level of communication between vlans is relatively small and it has never been an issue.
 ​
 We recently installed a new security camera system and I am looking to relieve the new traffic now moving through the firewall from the camera to employee VLANs. My initial thoughts were to add IPs and a static route on our L3 core switch (that we currently do not use for any routing) and change the gateway for the camera vlan to point to the switch. I would keep the gateway of the employee vlan to the firewall, but the L3 switch would also be in the subnet sending the video feeds from the camera vlan, I was also planning on setting up the switch ACLs so just the camera ports are allowed through the switch.
 ​
 Does that sound reasonable? I could also change the DHCP scope for the employee vlan to the core and set the default route to the firewall on the switch, but the traffic to the camera vlan from employee is pretty minimal.

I've been learning from the official Cisco courses for the ENCOR and ENARSI exam (from cisco learning networks store), but unfortunately there is no single course there, that would prepare me for the CCIE EI lab. 
 Do you guys have any recommendations on what course/courses to take over the next few months/years to prepare for the lab?
 I'm thinking about starting the official course for the ENSDWI. That would probably prepare me for the SD-WAN part, because although I have some experience with it, but to learn how to set it up from 0 it totally different from just operating it and making some changes to it.
 Unfortunately at my company we don't have any clients, that would use Cisco SD Access, so I'm also looking for a place, where I can at least do some labs with the Cisco DNA Center. Also a bit more some BGP and MPLS practice wouldn't hurt, but I think that can be simulated by GNS3 or some other network sim.
 Do you have any preffered courses? What did help you to earn CCIE (or how are you preparing for CCIE)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So - I was recently voluntold to help get a new network implemented for a nonprofit I help out at. Sure! I forgot how much i forgot however, it’s been a hot minute. Hoping you all can help get me on the right path.
 Setup: all 1G managed switches, Some connected by copper some by fiber/SFPs. Low low client count (under 100). There’s also a cable company provided gateway/router which spits out 192.168.0.x DHCP addresses internally. They also pay for two static IPs 10.x.x.x that currently go to some standalone ubiquiti server that routes them and handles the wifi internet access point traffic currently. The idea is to retire all that soonish. Keep if we must.
 All i wanted to do was set up this new network of switches i mentioned above on its own subnet (192.168.2.x) and everything on that subnet would be static IPs - and connect it at one place on ine switch with (i had assumed) A static route so anything not .2.x would get pushed to the cable company gateway/router and to the outside world. The .2.x subnet is for a POE camera system for them so thats why i was thinking keep it separate.. flawed? There’s also wifi 6 access points they want to add later for internet connectivity, and retire the old ubiquiti setup.
 Is this the right idea? Or should i swap over everything to be on the .0.x subnet? Should i leave everything on DHCP?
 Thanks..

 Does anyone know how to create a KQL alert for when a user is having 2 MFA app Authentication Methods configured? By default we have 1 app MFA method and Phone SMS setup, but if a user setup app MFA method for lets say a tablet, or another phone, then we want to have an alert on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We have some issues with the networking thought you may have the same experience or you could help.
 We are running QEMU/KVM on Dual Epyc servers (256 logical core) with Mellanox dual 40G connections. When our customers were pushing more than 50k pps and a few hundred mbps starts to drop the VM's packets. However, the server load and the network load are very low almost nothing.
 We were start tune the network and the Kernel of the host as AMD/Intel recommended to see how it goes. Started using Vhost and multi-queues but now we are seeing a heavy load on the CPU from the Vhost/network which is higher than 70% of the CPU time with only a small number of VM's on these servers. Around 60VM's with low usage on CPU and 500Mbit (110k pps) on the network. The two Epyc 7h12 with 256 logical cores are pushing around 80 percent of the CPU and more than 60 percent of it is from the network/vhost. Now we don't have packet drops but under a heavy CPU load.
 Here are the configurations and changes we made.
 We have started with this 3 months ago
 -netdev tap,id=nic0,ifname=$TAPIF,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on,queues=8 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=nic0,mq=on,vectors=10,mac=$MAC 
 Still had packet loss.
 Latest config. High CPU load but no packet drops.
 -netdev tap,id=nic0,ifname=$TAPIF,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on,queues=2,poll-us=50000 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=nic0,mq=on,vectors=10,rx_queue_size=1024,tx_queue_size=1024,packed=on,mac=$MAC 
 This is how we create a network interface
 ip tuntap add $TAPIF mode tap user $َUSERNAME multi_queue
 Any idea?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a few Windows Server VMs on-prem. All of them except for our DNS/DHCP server are not super critical. Even if our DNS/DHCP server was compromised or died, we have a back up of the configs that we could just throw on a new Windows server instance. Most other VMs mainly just serve as app servers for facilities, or jump boxes for ScreenConnect. We run Veeam backups, but they're not being off-sited. They could go down and people could still do their jobs, but we'd still have to rebuild things for them.
 If we were ever compromised, the org would not really be heavily affected, but we'd probably spend quite a bit of time setting new things back up. My question, is should we invest the money and time into making sure we have off-site backups if the information is not super critical? Or are things more critical than I really think?

What are the requirements for the tranceivers? I need a downstream on the switch end and upstream on the router end? Do the brands need to be the same?

 Another long time lurker, fist time poster. Sorry for languange (not my first language) and if i missed community.
 So, my company is IT company, dealing primary in software developement. We are part of companys that are privaty held by one person. No compay helds share of other company, one person is phisical owner of all companys. Also owners wish is that our compay deals with all IT related problem.
 So the problem is, that people from this companys are freaquenty working in some other company ( in this group of companys) and bringing their PC's around, making a mess with licence tracking. It is not realistic, that when a person is tasked to work at other company for a period of time, his PC will be sold to this company and then (after he is finished) soled back to primary company again.
 So our idea is, that my company (IT) would own all the PC's and server, and leasing it to other companys. We can easly track where some PC is (majoraty of month), and invoiced the proper compay for monthy usage of this PC. But i cannot get the information if this kind of bussines model is legal from Microsoft Windows OS stand point? We would like to do the same with servers (Win Srv 2019 Datacenter for hosts and Standard for WMs).
 Can we buy PCs and laptops with OEM Win PRO licence and lease them to other companys?
 Thank you for pointing me in right direction, i will gladly provide additional information. And off course leagal and financial teams will be involved before pulling the trigger on the decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm looking for a recommendation for a product that folks have used and are happy with. I think ultimately we'd like a single product for endpoint security, but that may not be possible. 
 The most pressing issue is endpoint content filtering and https decryption. We need to be able to control URLs per-user or per-user group, and when we enable certain URLs (office365 for example) we need to re-write http headers to allow login only to certain tenants (similar to this KB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/tenant-restrictions ) However, we're going to want to control this for more and more cloud providers (adobe cloud, google workspaces, aws, etc) and each has a slightly different way they want the http header re-written to be able to lock down which users can login. 
 The above is my most pressing need right now, and cisco umbrella can do this when using the more advanced flavors of the product and the cisco AnyConnect agent on the endpoint, however it's limited to like 6 cloud providers at the moment, and not flexible. 
 So please let me know if you have a product you are happy with that can do the above. Now ideally this product would also replace our AV/Firewall/EDR as well, but that's sort of a secondary goal. 
 Thanks in advance

 What can I use instead of RMON to have good network visibility? Sflow or something similar could be a good alternative, ya? What would you suggest to replace with RMON?
 Apart from that, A sound box with REST API support or NETCONF support, could give the network operator what RMON provides, right?

 - All the data is stored on a Synology NAS 70TB capacity
 - There are 50TB of data and 4 million files
 - There is an unused old/outdated Isilon cluster with 289TB available
 - Not all data has the same criticality and many of them files are GigaBite sized could points or HD video. Loads of photos too 
 To me the easiest way would be to use Hyper Backup on synology to Isilon but when configuring it says "no modules available" and given Isilon is on a very much outdated version and this cannot be reverted (rsync 2.6.9 version) I would love to hear any ideas and create a nice discussion topic

What is the accepted 'protocol'? Do we redirect and issue an auto-reply saying the employee is deceased? Do we say nothing?? When an employee leaves under normal circumstances their mailbox is archived and their email address is added as an alias to someone else's mailbox who picks up any emails.
 What do you do? We don't have a HR dept to ask.

 I have been working as an IT-apprentice now for 1.5 years (my first job in IT ever). I have mostly done first line support for the company, this including installing new PCs, setting up new users, printers, phones, meeting rooms etc.
 In about a month there will be a subject test for me to get a certificate of apprenticeship.
 I just recieved what the last two apprentices had to do and I have no idea how to do this stuff as I have not done this type of stuff before, ever.
 In short what I have to do:
 "Set up a new IT-system for a school/business."
 - Three servers: two Domain Controllers and one Fileserver
 - Install two clients with windows and configurating them
 - IP range/segment (?)
 - Set up and configurate: AD, DNS, DHCP, Print and Document Services, Shares, Public and personal space.
 - Set up GPO for public and private
 - I also need to set up a switch, wich the two clients and printer will be connected to.
 The servers will be virtual (VMware)
 I have googled, but not sure what Im looking for.
 Im not asking for a full guide, but rather a nodge in the right direction. 
 This test will be over five days, I will also need to plan, document and evaluate my own work before presenting it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 I'm setting up some systems for the first time so I wanted to check best practices and security before implementation. I'm working for a SMB, the time has come to replace our old fileserver which contains over 20TB of files over the past several years. Currently, this file server's a windows server with multiple SMB shares on for pretty much all work across the business. 
 ​
 A new Dell ME5 Powervault has been set up running RAID10 with a single large LUN & volume. I have several queries on the best practice and configuration having only really worked with small setups single hosts, local storage etc. I'd like to ensure this is done properly.
 ​
 1) Should I just attach the Powervault on iSCSI using windows iSCSI Connect on a VM, then place the NTFS files direct on here? Or would a large VHDX be better for any reason e.g. performance, security, backup then mount this to Hyper-V? Or even multiple smaller VHDX's due to the size? 
 2) Security wise without too much impact on performance what is best e.g. CHAPS, Full disk encryption on the PowerVault, separate VLAN between the Powervault and Hypervisor? This would be done using a core switch, I don't have separate hardware I could use for isolation. 
 3) Is robocopy still the best method using MIR or /XO and ran before and after cut-off of the old server shares?
 4) Any other advise on best practices and security?

 I want that domain users can restart a specific service. I was able to set the permission with sc.exe.
 So far so good. But with this settings the user is also able to just stop the service, what I dont want. So I want to deploy a cmd script, instead of advising the users to do something in services. So the users can just double click the cmd script and the service will restart.
 Even though I granted the access for the user to restart the service (it works in services), the access with cmd (net stop && net start) is not granted. Is there a possibility?
 Best regards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 Having an odd issue, we have half a dozen staff using Macs for creative work and over 40 staff on windows devices. The windows devices have 0 issues with the SMB V3 share. Our macs also seem to work fine, i'm able to download and upload large files fairly quickly no issue.
 The problem we're having is InDesign saving to our servers SMB share. A 15MB InDesign file with a few images linked takes 40 seconds to save both when opened from the server and saved back or worked from a local source and saved to the server. I can copy a few GB from the same device to the server in less time with finder. If saved locally InDesign saves instantly. If copied and pasted from the macs local drive to the server it's also instant. InDesign feels like it just spins for 35s before trying to create a file.
 Has anyone else experienced this? We're using InDesign 18.1 on a 2017 iMac running Monterey 12.3.1 and a 2020 iMac also running the same OS and InDesign version. I've tried earlier versions back to 17.0 with the same issue still occurring.

 Sometimes, it can be overwhelming and tiring to manage these tasks. I'm curious to know if other DevOps/system engineers feel the same way. Do you also find this part of your job to be frustrating and tedious, that you try to avoid it and start procrastinating?

 The VM with Ubuntu, would only be used to create that share.

 Checking if anyone on /r/networking knows the status of job market in those markets , and what skills are sought after there ? Have started scouring the job sites to get a reasonable idea what to expect though would be nice to get some opinions from actual grunts on the ground.

 If I am connected to network A via a VPN, (same network, same public IP) the connection works fine every time. 
 When running a traceroute to the database URI directly from network A, the requests time out at servers owned by the corporation running our managed firewall, but they claim to outbound traffic to Azure on port 5432 gets blocked. 
 When running traceroute connected to network A via VPN, it immediately just times out. 
 Does anyone have an idea of what might be wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 I am going to struggle to articulate what I'm looking to achieve here because I'm not sure how I go about this. 
 We currently have a suite of software delivered by a third party application - kind of like adobe creative cloud but for engineering.
 Now we had a policy change that means we no longer allow any user to be a local admin group member on any client endpoint. We instead use LAPS for the odd occasion when admin right sis needed.
 Before this policy change, the software suite was run via a service whose user was in every local admin group on all user endpoints, so this service no longer works and we're struggling to use other methods such as intune due to the size of the applications etc.
 So I guess what my question is, how do I make a service have the ability to run things as an administrator in the users login? 
 The applications we install are all based on a network share and currently I run the application as the local (LAPS) administrator and then pass user credentials to access the share. Very clumsy. The alternative I have setup for now is a script that deploys via intune its mounts a drive as system using hardcoded user credentials in the script to mount the share as a drive then manually running a shortcut for the executable (this is hit and miss). 
 My assumption is to run the service as system, but I don't think that this would be able to access network shares and also be able to interact with the user session for the install.
 Apologies if this is not very clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got a non-standard request that I haven't encountered before.
 A client has a company-issued laptop that will be used by remote/outsourced staff based overseas and as consequence of that, they'd like this laptop to be prevented from joining public WiFi networks but to still be able to join any WiFi networks that are considered either home or corporate networks.
 This a Windows 10 laptop joined to an Azure AD domain.
 I'm unsure of any built-in method in Windows that can achieve this and the client's current AV solution also doesn't have this functionality built into it (Webroot Endpoint).
 I know you can block a Windows device from joining specific SSIDs but Windows only determines a network is public/private/domain AFTER joining it via NLA, so on a technical level I don't see how the OS would know that particular network is "public" before being joined to it and therefore know that it's not allowed to join it?
 Is this something that you'd only be able to implement via 3rd-party software?
 Are there any Azure AD-based security policies that could achieve this?

 What are some of the most useful "canned" or custom queries / search functions you've utilized, that you couldn't do without? 
 As an example, in Tanium for instance it might be useful to get all workstations that need a reboot. For this, the query would be:

 What are some examples of some "go to" scripts, queries etc that you use frequently?

 Current: SysOps focused on infrastructure - compute and storage. About 70% on-prem/30% AWS.
 Future: Moving some of the environment to GCP, signing on with Snowflake for our data and reporting source. Manager has mentioned over the next few years our roles (2 Sr engineers incl me, 1 Jr engineer) will be migrating to more of a data engineering role. 
 My question for the hive: Where do I start my knowledge migration? I'm heavily involved in the Snowflake build and rollout. Should I start to focus on SQL, Python? Look into PowerBI and Looker (GCP)? I'm not feeling overwhelmed yet, but feel if I wait too much longer to get new knowledge learned, I'll start falling behind. I'd like to stay on top of it all as much as I can.

 Then I went back to college, dropped that shitty job, got an internship at $30/hr; got 4 IT certifications, working on cool tech I never thought I would touch in a million years. Life's pretty good, and have been at my current employer since.
 However, these recruiters at TEKsystems will not leave me alone. They keep calling me at odd hours of the day asking me if I want to work for pennies, they keep sending me emails for job listings that are asking for the whole IT department in one person. No matter how much I tell them I make, a new recruiter comes by every week or two and does the same thing. It's like a bad ex that won't leave me alone.
 My advice to the new people trying to break into IT reading this is to never touch TEKsystems, and to never give them your information. There has to be a mom & pop shop near you that'll be much better to work for, these parasites will just keep calling you no matter what. Learn from my mistake.

 We have a dozen servers with exactly the same software and only one is doing this; vMotion to another host doesn't affect it. Nothing in the event logs leading up to it (other than AG disconnect notice during it) that's unique. Persists after reboot. No indication in metrics of high CPU or RAM usage or high disk latency or queue length or anything leading up to the event.
 Did something in last month's Windows Update really FUBAR it? Any idea what to look at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi we are looking at building a low latency MPLS/WAN deployment. We currently use SDWAN this is great but it runs over the internet. We currently see 15-20ms between sites. We have 2 x RO 5Gb on 10Gb connections at 4 key sites. One issue with this design is the latency is too high for our old applications. The other issue is the MTU is around 1300 usable with the SDWAN headers. 
 What I’m looking for is to put point to point connections between each of the sites. We already have 2 links between 2 of the sites that are 10Gb OSA giving us sub 1ms latency between these sites. This means I need 3 more point to point connections and 2 routers for each site. 
 Total 5 OSA links. 2 already in place. 8 routers with at least 4 x 10Gb connections on each. 
 Any advice or thoughts would be great. Thanks

The distance between the access layer and thr core switches exceeds the limitation of Multimode optics (upwards of 1km). To minimize the cost of Single mode transceivers i have decided to add a distribution layer in the middle. This, in addtion to now enabling MM optics , enables better segregation of the network as I can bring L3 closer to the access layer.
 Client however does not like the distribution layer i the middle and whats to go Sm between Access and core.
 Still trying to convince the client that the 3 tier topology is best. Are there other advantages than the ones ive mentioned?
 P.S the core switches are big enough to handle either topology.

(Also, that switch has a fan failure). The switch I want to remove contains the SFP. I did some reading and am still a little fuzzy on what is going to happen. I have a spare sfp to move into the switch I plan to keep. My thoughts are:
 Backup Config
 Power down switch, install new sfp, configure vlans.
 Backup config
 Power back down and remove the stacking cable.
 Look in irf and look for "missing" switch and remove.
 Does this sound correct? Will the remaining switch automatically retain the config along with the ip address that is already assigned?
 Anything else I am missing or not thinking of?
 Thanks for any advice/assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the moment we are looking for an improvement in our data centers. We have two separated DCs that have redundant layer 2 dark fiber connections (not in use). In both datacenters are collapsed core topologies which are then connected to the campus core. The datacenter Vlans are routed from the respective collapsed core, i.e. the SVIs are located on the core VPC pair. The VPC peers share the gateway IP using HSRP.
 Since we want to connect both datacenters with layer 2 and the vlans should be available in both datacenters to move VMs back and forth comfortably, the question is how to solve this in the smartest way. My extensive internet research, unfortunately, has not brought a perfect solution. In addition, the documentation is often outdated (OTV/DCI etc.).
 One often mentioned possibility is to have 2 gateways in the DCs with two HSRP groups, but this does not seem to be a suitable solution. I was thinking of pulling another layer into the topology, so that the collapsed core layer becomes the aggregation layer. Above then comes a real core layer with all SVIs and again HSRP gateway. One VPC peer of the core layer would then be in the first DC and the other VPC peer in the second DC.
 Does anyone have an idea or a suggestion or is there no getting around VXLAN for such concepts nowadays ?

 I’ve noticed an issue when testing the 1G interfaces of ROUTER-01 via the SWITCHES. I’m only seeing 76% utilisation when I expected closer to 100%. On further diagnosis using our testers, I am only passing 10% though the ROUTER-01 1G interfaces and then only 10% from SWITCH-01 via the interface ROUTER-01 connects to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The company I'm working for is attempting to set up a connection between a control shack and a piece of equipment wirelessly. They have purchased 2 Silex AP-100AH (which appear to be 802.11ah wireless access points) to communicate with each other between the equipment and the control shack.
 Is it possible for these two pieces of equipment to actually communicate with each other? It's my (limited) understand that WAP's can't communicate with each other (unless they have a bridging feature). Am I wrong to think we need at least one BR-100AH which is a wireless bridge? What would the optimal network topography look like for this arrangement? Thanks!

It`s 1024 bit, and as far as I know today`s standard is 2048 at least, even if 1024 bit length key is not broken yet.I`m just wondering what is a real attack scenario based on short ssh-rsa host key? Supposing (hypothetically ) the adversaries derived private key from public, what are those keys used for? What the attacker can do with that? I understand that host key pair is used for a host authentication, but is that all? Does it take part in key exchange procedure?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've never used Terraform and Kubernetes and the project hasn't started yet, so if you think I should switch technologies feel free to let me know. I usually use Docker and Puppet.
 ​
 Suppose I have 3 dedicated servers and a VPS
 ​
  
A Dedicated server running Postgres on Kubernetes
 A Dedicated server running a Go server on Kubernetes
 A Dedicated server running Python sever on Kubernetes
 The VPS is used to monitor those servers and for admin tasks
  
​
 I have the following questions:
 ​
  
Let's say that the Postgres server is running low on resources, does Kubernetes notify me to buy a new server? 
 
If I need to set alarms manually to buy a new server, then what are the best practices? How do you decide when it's time to buy a new server? 
 
Can I buy a new server and not add it to any cluster and let Kubernetes decide if it wants to add it to any of the clusters mentioned above? Can I have servers on standby and then Kubernetes either use it for Postgres or Go etc?
 
How to protect against DDOS? Do I run all the clusters behind Cloudflare Or Do I buy additional firewall servers and run the clusters behind the firewall? Is it easy to set up Cloudflare?
 
 ​
 So essentially, we're starting a new project, and we'll need at least 3 servers and a VPS as mentioned above, the project might scale up and if it does, I want to have answers to those questions so I know how to act.

Or we put roadblocks in place so they can’t have what they request, using the excuse of GDPR or PCI. I won’t go into specifics but it’s pretty clear he’s lying, sometimes it’s just unrelated entirely but users buy into it because he bombards them with buzzwords and tech language. Overhearing it gives me second hand embarrassment. Someone complained once about wanting a different ISP because the last one let us down at a major event (this is true), all of a sudden my manager fucking hates him and refuses to assist him. Ever. 
 We also only choose suppliers that are his friends. The companies we choose get paid double what anyone else would charge, some work we could actually do in house as certain team members are actually certified in that area, but we choose to go with some random external contractors who charges insane amounts. 
 I don’t know how he’s getting away with it. Nobody dare question him because he confuses them with jargon and gets majorly defensive. 
 It’s making the job really rubbish, it feels like one vicious circle. User requests support with purchasing new software > user complained about IT once > we refuse to assist them > user buys new system themselves anyway > system gets implement with no support from us, constant roadblocks, dragging our heels > poor end users get issues and ring for help, we refuse. It’s so fucking awkward as the person answering the phone to deny them assistance.
 I do this job to earn money, I know it’s not personal, but honestly it makes me sad how far behind we are with technology and not giving end users a solution that would really improve their work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow sysadmins, seeking your advice on how to address a recent phishing email incident in our organization. The email successfully bypassed our existing security measures and landed in one of our executive's inbox. The concerning part is that the email display name was cleverly spoofed to appear as our internal HR department, despite coming from an external email address r12fdf@icloud.com.
  
 I'm wondering if adding our HR department email group (hr@mycompany.com) and other similar department email groups as a "user" to be protected from impersonation in Microsoft Defender anti-phishing policy would prevent similar spoofed display emails from reaching any of our user's inboxes.
  
 I would appreciate any suggestions, insights, or alternative solutions that you might have in this regard. Thank you for your help in advance! On M365 Exchange Online and Microsoft Defender.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am preparing to install some nexus 9ks to replace our old nexus hardware. While I don't plan on making many changes during the upgrade process I am trying to get a feel for what I could be with them. So far I have been looking into potentially moving toward VXLAN and possibly leveraging guestshell to do occasional validation testing of network throughput using iperf or something. Not sure what I could use as a client to test against a 100gb network, but the switches are very oversized currently.
 However I know there is a lot more I could look into. Even if I don't use it I enjoy learning interesting things and what I learn today will likely get used when the next absurd network requirement is asked. This is my first time having the opportunity to plot the future of a smaller datacenter and I don't want the network to ever be the reason why something can't be done (hence the current plans for VXLAN).
 Thanks in advance for any suggestions or avenues of research!

Linux seems to accept any USB stick as a hardware token, as long as it's initially configured by the pam library. Alternatives such as nitro/solo/only key exist, and known brands such as kingston and verbatim have models on which Fido protocol is implemented.
 So what would be the point of getting a pricy yubikey ? Because yubico partners with big services providers ? Is a "pam homecooked" hardware token not crossplatform ? not accepted by these service providers ? Is yubikey the answer only because it embed additional NFC hardware/feature ?
 I'd appreciate any teaching from you guys

 Since the company already uses Microsoft 365, that somehow uses the Azure infrastructure, is there any particular method I should use when creating the Azure account?

 Simple networking question
 Hey, all. I’d consider myself to have intermediate network knowledge and I need some advice. …
 Currently I purchase 2 static IPs from my business internet provider. I use one for my public router, the other is for the company’s Fortigate which tunnels to corporate. The setup has worked well, but I’m slightly limited. 
 Since I’ve converted to VoIP, our non business class routers don’t do a good job handling traffic for 10 phones, even with QoS on and SIP disabled. 
 Currently, I’ve migrated the phones to behind the WAN. The Fortigate handles them much better, but I’m limited. There are blocked ports, some of which affect phone provisioning. The Fortigate is corporately controlled. I’m able to access the UI, but it’s connected to FortiManager for its config. Making any changes that large would throw a big red flag. 
 Should I keep the two statics, or should I save money and migrate to a single DHCP? If so, what can I put behind the modem to manage traffic (on the cheap!). Can I provision a managed switch to handle the ISP, QoS for the phones, and separate the traffic for the Fortigate? Do I have to buy something expensive like a Ubiquiti VLAN capable device? I’m open to any ideas.

 So one of my other challenges is hardware vendors switching to subscription support models and software vendors ditching prpertual licensing for that sweet...sweet stock inflating continuous revenue stream (I'm looking at you Citirx and VMware!)
 We're currently looking into upgrading our current Exchange 2013 environment (yes...I know its EOL beginning of April...grrrrr) and were looking into on-prem for depreciation and CAPex, but that was deemed too expensive so the upper's considered O365 because it was a less expensive hit this year as OPex.
 Now, the C-suite is involved and I can't do anything while it is discussed further. Discussions have been going on for over a year and a half and I am still at square one when either way, I could have been done already.
 I mean...it's not like Email is a lifeblood of a business or anything /s
 My question...is it possible to depreciate expenses like O365 and subscription VMware/Citrix licensing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Luckily for me, I am a part of a company that decided to cheap out on their VoIP implementation, meaning we are using a system that is horribly outdated. We are using a "Zulty's" system that has a phone app you can download, but half the time it doesn't seem to work.
 For example, if you receive a phone call, answer it, then end the call, you have to be sure you re-open the app, or else you will be stuck on "On the phone" status, meaning any additional phone calls will not ring to the app until you open the app again.
 So, my question is, has anyone ever had to deal with a situation where you need to route it through something else? Even if it is to route it through something like Google Voice, etc. we are dealing with a call group (our helpdesk line) that is hit or miss if the person on-call is receiving the phone call, because the app is terrible.
 My experience with VoIP is limited as you may be able to tell, but any suggestions are great. We can't move to another system with just that number / phone group as it's a part of a contract, however just being able to get a phone call through something whether it's through another app that is better would make our lives so much easier.
 Thanks if you have any ideas!

 Unfortunately, I don't have the time or space to store it. To consider digitising them. I don't even know if it's valuable.

I am considering decommissioning the server and moving to Exchange Online only. I wanted to share my thoughts and get some feedback on whether this is possible or the correct way to go about things.
 First, let me explain a bit about my current setup. Our organization has been using Exchange Server 2016 for several years now, and we implemented a hybrid deployment with Office Online. This allows us to have the benefits of both on-premises and cloud-based Exchange, including password and directory synchronization. 
 However, as we continue to evaluate our IT infrastructure, we are considering moving to Exchange Online only. There are several reasons for this, including cost savings, security, and reliability.
 So, is it possible to decommission the Exchange Server 2016 and move to Exchange Online only? We want to keep our AD syncing with Azure and our passwords syncing. I read this article (below) that says we should keep an Exchange server online, but we are at the point where I'd either need to spin up some new VMs or go Exchange Online only.

Currently we run a SAML IDP with a custom authentication process that reads from multiple databases, no central user storage or management, authentication is a function of a matching email existing in certain locations and the values of various database columns.
 There is no single source of truth for user information. Would like to store users in one place along with roles/permissions management. We transmit some of these as SAML attributes currently, sending what is relevant to each service provider.
 Most of these users are low value, not paying customers or employees and the client deemed Okta too expensive, I don't think they'd go above $0.25 per user but they'll happily pay tens of thousands for us to set up something free.
 It's not exactly my wheelhouse and I'd be doing this entirely on my own with a restrictive timeline/budget so I need some advice. Would like to stick with SAML auth since I know it works on all things users need access to and I have a decent understanding of it at this point. Could Azure AD suit these needs? That's my 2nd choice after Okta but the presentation to me as a developer isn't as clear.
 I'm leaning towards a cloud product recommendation and help setting it up vs something we'll have to install, configure, host and maintain, because of the severely limited resources, but may have to go with something self-hosted due to budget constraints.

 ​
 This script first defines the name of the app to be blocked. It then gets the path to the startup folder for the current user's Terminal Service profile from the registry. If the startup folder exists, the script checks if the app is already there, and if so, it exits. If the app is not there, it creates a shortcut to the app and adds it to the startup folder. Finally, the script outputs a message indicating that the app has been blocked on startup.

I thought maybe it's dirty, or dirty fingers, but for some reason, I'll be moving my pointer and suddenly it stops. I then have to wait for it to decide to work again. No issue with using multi-fingers to scroll, zoom, etc. Just the single finger Has anyone else experienced this? As you can imagine, this has made remote access more challenging than usual when I can't use a mouse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so I've been in this space for a few years, and have worked with servers from HP, Dell, Cisco, even a smattering of supermicro and fujitsu. But we got about 40 servers from Lenovo about two years ago, and they have been nothing but a constant headache. Which fine, A bad firmware here, a faulty driver there, it has happened with all of them. The problem comes down to the support. 
 Their support has NO clue what they are doing, Every time we call in, we have to explain the situation to them multiple times, We demonstrate the problem to them, and they cannot comprehend what the issue is. Like they've never done break/fix before in their lives, and so troubleshooting steps are foreign to them. Their knee jerk reaction to any issue is a motherboard swap. We've had the motherboard on a system replaced 7 and 8 times without resolving the very obviously firmware issue. 
 The techs they send out are all contract, and other than replacing system boards have no knowledge or desire to do anything beyond swapping boards, there have been several times they have failed to update serial numbers and other things (I believe they have all been IBM techs). 
 The newest experience has me laughing, We opened a ticket for a power supply gone bad, and they somehow confused us with another company, and Now we're invited to a teams meeting monday for their issue. 
 Has anybody had a good experience with Lenovo support for servers? any tips? 
 When I did desktop support, I LOVED Lenovo thinkpad support, they had amazing support processes, and super knowledgeable people, fast response times, etc. It has been the exact opposite with the servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I launched a software licensing service not that long ago. As a Software Vendor (I made a desktop app that I was looking to to sell), I found existing Software Licensing solutions (FlexLM, Sentinel, Wibu, Nalpeiron) were either prohibitively expensive to adopt and difficult to use, or just didn't have sufficiently robust capability.
 I think looking at it from the software Vendor's perspective is only part of the problem, since many end users also complain about licensing (more so than the vendors!). Looking through other threads, some of the big issues that kept coming up seem to be:
 - Easier to "steal" rather than install and activate correctly
 - Difficult to get buy in from higher ups to switch to a software with easier to work with licensing policies. We're talking monolithic On-Prem License servers with UI from the 90s that have never been updated used to enforce concurrency.
 - There is no single agreed upon standard, every ISV might have their own definitions for floating licenses, a seat, or a user-based license provisioning. This inconsistency makes SAM automation a nightmare.
 - ISVs sometimes prefer to prevent piracy rather than deploy in an environment that they cannot control (in a VM, for example).
 - Hardware Dongles aren't going away.
 - Node Locking fails often for many reasons (MAC address isn't persistent; you attach a new dock and the device fingerprint changes etc.). 
 What else could be improved to make licensing software less of a headache for everyone? #opensource

 We are looking at deploying WPA3 on our APs for our AD managed devices.
 Currently have an 802.1x WPA2 GPO with computer cert based authentication setup.
 Issue running into is our DCs are still server 2016, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to setup WPA3 within the GPO settings. Server 2022 does have that option for WPA3, so would it be possible to just introduce a brand new 2022 VM into our DC environment to apply these settings? Planning on upgrading all DCs to 2022 by the end of this year, but just want to start testing WPA3 802.1x right now.
 Thanks!

I have an end user whose mapped drives are suppose to connect automatically at start up but they don't. The drives show up with red x's and only when you click them it turns green. From my understanding windows runs a script at start up when it is configured to connect mapped drives automatically. Is it possible that the windows script is timed to run before the stp forward delay timers reach zero and move the switch port into a forwarding state? If so, portfast is most likely disabled. Just looking for some insight before I decide to escalate this ticket.

 I work out in Hawaii, and we have 2 offices on 2 islands, served by 2 ISP's - Office_A is served by HawaiianTel on the island of Maui, and Office_B is served by Spectrum on the island of Oahu.
 Question: why do I get 2 different traceroute results from either location when running a simple traceroute between the 2 sites?
 From Office_A to Office_B, it's 14 hops, that actually runs from Maui -> Oahu -> California -> Oahu.
 However, from Office_B to Office_A, it's just 9 hops bouncing from router to router on Oahu before heading to Maui.
 Why wouldn't the traceroute results be more or less the same?

 Obviously traffic shaping from the ISP is a very possible scenario- but aside from that, there could be issues with the traffic between the ISP and the cloud provider server- right? Of the parties involved, who would be responsible for sorting that out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so hopefully someone can advise here.
 We have quite a complicated setup which I'll miss a lot of information out to keep this brief... we have an OSPF instance (OSPF 20) with our ISP. The ISP advertises several routes to us including a default route and a route to one of our remote branches among DCs.
 We also receive a route to our remote DC from another OSPF instance (OSPF 10) with our internal routers. This is redistributed into OSPF by the neighbor route as an E1 route.
 At present, the route to the remote DC that is making it into the routing table is the one from the ISP (OSPF 20), while we want the traffic to route internally via OSPF 10.
 I've tried a few ways to fix this but can't seem to crack it. I though using a route-map against a distribution list on the ISP OSPF instance to set the metric higher would work if I matched the route I was interested in, but it seems to filter out all routes from the ISP EXCEPT the one I want to affect.
 I feel like I'm missing something crazy obvious here, any chance one of you geniuses can help me out?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Networkers of reddit,
 This issue first came up with a client that couldn't process their CC transactions after coming back from lunch. Essentially they could not resolve xyz domain and further examination revealed other domains also not being able to be resolved but 95% of domains on the internet are being resolved.
 Ive pegged it down to the Fortigate(s) simply because if we Ethernet into the back of Comcast modem DNS resolves to these specific domains. Alright so then I remembered our own business uses Comcast business and also has a Fortigate 61E and I can reproduce the problem on our network. I even noticed now I cant even hit the slickdeals website to which I was just checking it out last week on my machine. OK so I if i know the IP and setup a forward zone on the DC to the IP for the domain it routes and comes up. If i setup my machines DNS to googles/openDNS/comcast DNS it still will not resolve. If i nslookup using another DNS server besides the domain controller it will not resolve. I feel this eliminates the windows DNS DC(s). Packet captures show the DNS requests going to the DC out so I dont understand why the requests are timing out. I can double check the WAN packet capture but why would it fwd DNS request for certain domains and not others?
 No changes have been made to the Fortigates OS 7.x on any of these separate sites and neither have any web filtering rules other than blocking foreign countries inbound. There are no external connector feeds to 2 of the sites and ive disabled them on our site. I can replicate this problem across 3 different places across the city the only correlation being they are all on comcast business using fortigates across multiple workstations. Software upgrades on the fortigates are manual so I can only think of something being bugged, exploited or i need other ideas. I hope ive explained enough to get some insight from you guys.

 We have a small network in one of our outlying buildings consisting of a Sophos Firewall, and an Aruba switch. There are 3 subnets, LAN, WiFi, and the VPN.
 Yesterday users on the Wifi and VPN subnets were unable to connect to the Server on the LAN subnet, and vice versa. Connections LAN to LAN work flawlessly. No configuration or hardware changes had been made. 
 We noticed after doing some discovery that when attempting to ping PCs on the LAN subnet from any other subnet the packets would timeout 92% of the time. There would be a long series of timeouts, then a brief period (about 30 seconds or so) of connection that would work fine, then the connection would start timing out again for about 8(ish) minut…]]></summary>

 Things like "Hey I tried calling but you weren't at your desk. I left a voicemail and this email is a follow up when can we meet to get thing done" only for a few days later I get a call from a supervisor on how I hadn't got thing done cause user never responded to me
 ​
 to multiple emails about people needing to set up their new account for something only to have someone furious at me that they where never made aware of new account and they don't have time to create a username and password.
 ​
 Even simple things like asking for clarification on a problem, then not hearing from a person till they walk by 3 days later and ask if i have a solution for their problem that I wasn't even sure what the issue was. 
 ​
 Even in the last staff meeting I mentioned I would distribute my quick presentation via email only to loudly hear an employee say "Well no one reads your emails anyway" 
 ​
 I have been looking for my out (though i know this problem is everywhere) but it seriously just makes me feel like i am losing my mind when things end up being My fault cause someone doesn't read their email.

I've searched for suggestions between Aruba and Juniper, but I'm running into a lot of trouble comparing their exact specs. The short of it is, I need a 1RU, 48GBE (SFP+ / multgig a bonus, but not priority), POE+(at least 10 ports), L3 managed(or "2+"), with dual redundant PSU (Field replaceable preferred, but not required). 
 The closest I can tell, I should be looking at the 3810M or EX4100 series, but would really appreciate any input. If anyone could point me to a matrix that actually compares multiple brands, I will send you a digital kiss as well!

Am I right about the placement of the firewall and the BGP router?
 If the firewall doubles as an IPS, does that change anything?
 Does this require 2 firewalls?

 UPDATE: So far, the option of using TAP (suggested by u/zm1868179) seems to be the best option to try. So far, looks promising; although the TAP is supposed to stay active for 60 minutes, my outlook profile on iPhone is still active and still fetching mails. Not sure when the system will ask to log in again, but definitely not after 60 minutes. Will update the post.
 P.S. TAP is cumbersome as this has to be created by an admin, but it is kind of okay for a small company

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for patching tools that support schedules based on X days after Patch Tuesday such as AWS Maintenance Windows or Syxsense.
 Example: Test Environment A would patch 3 days after patch Tuesday. Prod Environment A would patch 12 days after patch Tuesday.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a decent patch tool for a multi-domain multi-site enterprise environment that supports this capability?
 Ideally the tool would be able to patch Windows and Linux OS environments as well as third party software (Acrobat Reader, Zip utilities, ect), but the biggest need at this point is Windows OS updates.

From what I gather, the mgmt console should be upgraded first and then the actual firewalls. Can I just call support during the upgrade in case it doesn't go smoothly or will i need pro services for something like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently transferred from one university division to another. In this new division I work in, they have never had an IT guy. Concepts like ticketing systems, remoting systems, and no access to admin for the average user is very foreign to them. I'm the single IT guy for about 300 users. This division has many departments.
 Active Directory was a mess. I've mostly straightened that out and reorganized OUs and such. They finally agreed to the purchase of a ticketing system. That got funded today....Really happy about that. I am sick of getting calls, emails, team messages, skype messages, texts, and office pop-ins. They are finally receptive to purchasing a remoting system. 
 But what really pushes my buttons are that the Leadership is stubborn on wanting all users to have administrative access to everything! I've showed them university SOPs. I've cited my state's government SOPs on admin credentials. I've told them I do not fill comfortable trading convenience for security. 
 My reasoning for posting this would be to ask for advice. Does anyone have any "scary" stories I can let my leadership read. I'm looking for cautionary tales that will scare them into submission! Also looking for advice on how to handle these asshats!

This is not a major installation, no raised floor CRAC or fancy fire suppression system. What might I incorporate into the design and layout to make things a bit more efficient and my life a little easier?
 Space is not finalized yet but it will be a minimum of 180 SF for four racks. Maybe a lot more. I will be installing ladder racks and Netfloor tiles. I will install new Ethernet throughout the office area too. It will have redundant cooling and a dedicated electrical subpanel.
 If enough space is available I plan to install a standing bench for equipment staging and diagnostic work.
 -edited to add, I did a very thorough cost analysis of moving to colo or public cloud, not going to happen-
 Thoughts?

 As an example the advanced threat hunting schema tables now include Device prefixed tables, and it has details on all devices and not just the ones licensed for P2.
 My intention is to keep most devices on Plan 1 while having a subset of devices on Plan 2. 
 Why is the portal letting me see details on all devices and not just the ones licensed for the higher tier? Is there some setting that can restrict this and filter out the noise down to P2 licensed devices only.

 I want to get certified, as of now i was sort of just thrown into the IT part of my job as i was "good with computers" and to be honest i love it, i've been doing it for the better part of 5 years now, setting up Intune, managing O365, creating a hybrid environment, setting up servers, FTP, Azure, Print servers, file servers, etc.. 
 I've been thinking/studying to take AZ-900 but what other Certifications would you recommend which would help me prove that i know what i say i know if you catch my drift.
 I would like to learn more about Security and Microsoft as well as Networking
 I did think about taking Security+ and CCNA but as i dont do any Networking in my job it's hard to learn it as i'm not working with it daily
 Thank you for reading and your response! And thank you for any tips!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have a client that uses an email to send personal information and documents to their clients. They specified that the email has to be able to send encrypted messages and multiple users need to be able to read and reply back to emails from it. No problem! we can set it up as a shared mailbox, and enable encryption on it.
 However, a phone call with the user, she also now mentions that she also needs her front desk to be able to log into the account to send scanned documents from this email and not just a shared email. This makes it a little more complicated because you now have to have a license attached to it for it to be logged into. No worries though, we can do this we just enable MFA (Now that it's going to be physically able to be logged into), give read/send permissions to the needed users so they can access from their email, and enable Encryption on the email. All done!
 Third call with the user comes, she now mentions that the email will be used for SMTP from a 3rd party with their application that they use to send out contracts, documents, etc. This is where it gets complicated, I have no idea how to keep this email secure with MFA (As far as my understanding, SMTP will not work with MFA enabled), we now can't change the password, or it's going to break the application from sending emails, and now we have 4 different people inside of this email that has access to personal, sensitive information.
 So my question is, how would you go about it to make this account secure and meet the requirements. We can make another account if needed and makes sense to do so.
 Requirements
 1) Allow SMTP
 2) Possibly Disable Login, if not then enable MFA.
 3) Allow shared account access from multiple users.

 I'd like start hosting some cyber-security competitions for some kids. Something like these: https://www.bestcolleges.com/bootcamps/guides/top-cybersecurity-competitions/, but ones that I control to whip out and use outside of competition days.
 Essentially, the way I see it working is that I produce a linux VM, make some insecure changes (no updates, passwords changed to 1234, password requirements, chmod 777 some config files, random executable in home dir, no anti-virus, etc.) and then get the kids to find and fix those changes, and get scored on the number of fixes they do.
 I can do all this with scripts etc. to check various scenarios and build the images, but I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on where to start or if they have an idea of scoring or any issues that should be included.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regardless of which firewall we are using from one of the popular brands like Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, or Sophos Fortinet, PA, Cisco or Sophos, what is the best way to allow a user to establish SSL VPN from only a specific device?
 While researching, I found that many of the admins suggest using PKI certificate-based authentication. However, I am concerned about the downsides of using a cert-based VPN.
 Firstly, certificates have a limited lifespan, which means I will have to monitor the age of all issued certificates continually. 
 This could mean a lot of effort, especially if we have so many VPN users.
 Secondly, not all regular users are knowledgeable enough to install a certificate on their device, which would mean that I would have to bring the device in to have the certificate installed. This could be a repetitive process because the certificate has a definite lifespan.
 Given these concerns, I wanted to ask the community: what is the best way to restrict SSL VPN access to specific devices while avoiding the downsides of cert-based VPN? Are there any alternative methods or best practices that I should consider? 
 Any insights or recommendations would be appreciated.

 I use WSL2 Ubuntu distribution for my development stuff and sometimes i need to access my Windows's localhost from WSL. There is an IP in /ets/resolv.conf that can be used to access Windows but firewall blocks all requests from WSL by default, after some digging i could not find a way to fix it with firewall rules so i tried to disable firewall just for WSL's virtual network adapter and it worked.
 Here is powershell command, that i use: Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Public -DisabledInterfaceAliases "vEthernet (WSL)"
 I does the thing as i said but the problem is that every time i disable/enable firewall with it, firewall spits out permission prompts for every program that i already permitted before. Sometimes it is very annoying, especeially when permissions are reset for my DLNA and network sharing sevices and i can no longer access my PC via local network.
 Is there something that i'm doing wrong? Would appreciate any advice on how to configure firewall to allow outbound requests from WSL environment without having to explicitly set permissions for every program again every time.

 ​
 Various apps from Word, Outlook, Excel to OneDrive all repeatedly prompting to sign in with their M365 credentials over and over. 
 ​
 Not seeing any pattern to as it seems to be impacting all Windows clients from local AD joined, AD joined with AADconnect sync, AzureAD Joined, Windows Hello, Regular password, or even basic workgroup. All same problem all in the past two weeks all different M365 tenants.
 ​
 ​
 The workaround is to 
  
open Word and click File - Account - Sign out all accounts
 
Then log off, log back in as a different local admin account and delete the folder: C:\Users\<username of the user with the issue>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPluginxxxxx\
 
Then reboot and log back in to Windows profile and sign back into the apps again.
 
 ​
 But even with that some people get the problem again the following day.

 The customer I am helping right now has created some simple diagrams about memory, CPU etc for switches, some temperature sensors from the server room, and UPC battery levels as tracked in the software they use for monitoring. This is, however, some really old version of the software and the view with diagrams needs to be scrolled so no use in displaying them on the monitor screen. Also, they need something to show/display to the boss which is rather general, and colorful but 'not too alarming' (should not be screaming about some newly detected problem too early, more like day average situation overview).
 Any advice? What would you put on the 'boss dashboard' about your network? What type of view would you do just to help you/your colleagues do their job?

 I started an internship a few months ago and was tasked with setting up a HA cluster with a few test servers, after about 2 or 3 weeks I figured it out and got it set up. Keep in mind I am studying Computer Science, so my knowledge on networking and system administration is limited, honestly not sure why they gave me this work to do. 
 Now a few days ago they gave me access to a live server they want me to set up and I ran into an error I don't know how to fix. 
 I am using two Window server 2019 and running mssql 2019. I wanted to set up the failover cluster, but when running the validate configuration wizard, I get this error:
 DHCP status for network interface 'servername'.'domainname' - Ethernet0 differs from network Cluster Network 1.
 The servername and domainname is filled in, but I just left it blank for security reasons 
 I have tried googling the problem, but I'm not getting any luck there. Also no one in the office knows how to work with databases, and the one guy that does kinda know what is going on, is very busy with other stuff so I can't bother him too much.

 I guess there's no right answer just trying to read the room on where it's headed.

 So far we've explored Bitwarden and 1Password, and I've also had a couple of brief flings with NordPass and Dashlane. None of them come up to feature parity with LastPass, but 1Password's security architecture was compelling.
 However, last week I came across Keeper, and it's the first product I've found that is enterprisey enough to have everything we're after, without being a full blown PAM/PAW solution like CyberArk. 
 The features we're after are:
  
Azure AD integration for login and user provisioning
 Custom templates for records
 Granular sharing
 Ease of use for 'normal' users
 Actually secure
  
Does anyone having any experience with Keeper to either say they'd recommend it, or recommend completely avoiding it?
 I've heard bad things about their Firefox plugin, but I will be doing a trial personally to validate that.
 Also, does anyone know of any in depth security assessments carried out by independent security experts that can validate that their security architecture is good?

 There is a shared mailbox used by the sales team. Periodically they'll get hit with waves of 50-100 per hour bounce-back notifications or "Mail Delivery Failure" messages. It's all mail servers responding with limited details, as in they don't include the original message, and from what I can tell the headers are not original so I can't glean much info.
 I'm still not 100% certain if this is originating with us. I'd like to confirm if someone has gained access to the outgoing SMTP and is sending from our mail server or if it's spoofed emails being bounced back to our spoofed email address.
 Does anyone have any helpful advice?
 The only useful info I've found so far on the backend is that "Real-Time Detections" show the incoming "Mail Delivery Failure" emails as quarantined malware emails. It lists us as the recipient and the mail servers as the senders.
 Where do I go from here?

 My job itself is very challenging and I get a lot of freedom in developing our infrastructure. The expertise in our team is skyhigh and I learn everyday. Every few months when I look back and I am amazed at how much I learned. I am allowed to make mistakes, no hard feelings. 
 Our team leads have vision for the future and know how to communicate this. As far as I can tell this vision is in line with the developments in our field.
 I get to be responsible for processes and I get to criticize policy and processes. If spearhead an effort to change something people listen with an open mind. Often people will think along with me and enable me to actually make a difference. 
 I work exclusively with Linux systems we fully administer ourselves. The only windows in my life is the labtop because thats policy. 
 The lunch at work is cheap and amazing in quality for what you pay. 
 Sure there are bad days and good days. The business is terrible at software development lifecycle. We get involved way too late. There are large problems with understaffing in our team. But in general the good far outweighs the bad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I am a storage/vmware admin at my current role and our network team is looking into moving away from our current network setup. We are currently using Xtreme switches and core and moving on the Fabric. 
 While my SAN switches are now not routed over the core and are different from my TOR switches. My 4 SAN switches are running standalone, 2 in each datacenter connected to each other. 
 Now with Fabric incomming our network team want to use the same switch for TOR and SAN network both routed over the core, is this a good idea ? 
 Currently i'm running a test cluster with a vmware host connected to 2 frabric switches for TOR & SAN and that traffic is running over our old core X8 back to our old SAN switch and our storage appliances. What I am seeing atm is there are only a few test VM's running on that host, but the latency is high. I wonder if this setup is a good idea or if it's better to keep SAN completaly seperated from the other traffic like it is in our current setup.

 The app essentially reads the settings from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App.
 Problem is that all computer accounts are in a single OU and it's beyond my decision & control to re-organize them in different OUs. And the requirement is the App needs to be configured based on user's role, so it needs to be User-specific settings. Computer is shared by multiple users shift work.
 What could be some creative ways to allow the app to be configurable via domain GPO and User-specific? Some ideas...
  
Insert them into HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App but the App would not read it there.
 PowerShell script on login to apply the settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Vendor\App. But the settings also needs to be cleared on logoff so the next user's settings can be applied? Or maybe clearing the settings isn't necessary since the next user's settings will just get re-applied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a DevOps consultant since late 2021. So far it has been un-fulfilling. I basically did this because everyone on my team left my old job aside from a couple people, including my manager leaving and it was the only easy option to get off the sinking ship. I've been a Systems Engineer previously for about 10 or so years.
 I can either go back to my old job possibly but no one on my team is there aside from two people, or try to find a new job that is remote only. I've been fortunate that my last 2 jobs out of 3, I've put my heart in and have gotten promotions and been able to do things that helped the company. With my latest it's just not the same.
 Has anyone been in the same boat? There are some people that got me here at my current job and I feel like I might burn bridges but I want to have that fire back in. I just feel like I work best devoted my time to fix things at a company as opposed to coming in, doing a project and leaving. I hate the feeling of starting a project with a bunch of new people and rinsing and repeating with other new people. It causes so much anxiety for me. I prefer to go to midsize company and pave the road and make a name for myself (based on my previous jobs this has worked out...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This just came up while configuring a new NAC deployment.
 Fairly common scenario that I've not thought through before. You have your relay agents (whatever they are) configured with a pair of dhcp servers to cover your ass. When the relay agent receives a request, does it forward to both, round robin, or some sort of stateful decision tree? Just finished reading rfc 1542 (best, most detailed description I could find) and I'm no better informed on the topic.
 At this point, I'd love to throw together a lab and experimentally check what a dozen different devices do, but have a few too many projects I'm behind on. Anybody already done this legwork?
 Whole question is because I stumbled upon instructions to setup the NAC mgmt port as an additional relay target and it will passively sniff for DHCP fingerprinting. Obviously clients get DHCP either way, just with more delays if there's some form of load balancing. But RR would mean fingerprinting is inconsistent across devices.

Put your phone on DND, eat lunch and make people wait. Stop being a pushover pussy and you won't have to come to reddit to vent and hate everyone every morning at 9AM. 
 Have some self respect and stop self loathing. Our jobs are difficult enough. You don't need to hate your position because you don't have enough self respect to stand up to people and tell them to fuck off very nicely.

 Recently I've moved to EVE-NG as my platform of choice, and it's great, except I can't for the life of me figure out how to start a docker container with (1) startup commands and (2) environment variables, both of which are required to run a containerized EOS. The EVE-NG team has not given much support on this subject, so I here I am asking you fine folks for help.
 Has anyone here gotten cEOS and/or custom docker images to run in EVE-NG?
 EDIT: Why am I getting downvoted? If you do a search on the subject you'll find that there is only ONE resource talking about how to run custom docker images on EVE-NG, but that is using docker-in-docker, which I want to avoid due to the performance tax. (The whole reason I'm using cEOS is to get better performance...). Plus the use-case for docker-in-docker is much more complex than starting a container with simple environmental variables.

 I put up a post over a year ago complaining about policy and management at my job, you can view on my profile. TLDR of that post was management was changing policy flip flopping back and forth and making our jobs harder because of it.
 I spent a lot of time at the old place complaining, and wallowing in my self pity. Thinking that I wasnt good enough and that there was no way another company would hire me. I blamed management for my unhappiness which is partially true but in the end it was my fault for staying and letting them make me unhappy.
 On the flip side yesterday I had my 6 month review at my new job that went spectacular. I found a place that is supportive and listens to employees to improve the company. It's not perfect by any means but no where really is. Since I've been here my mental health has improved, I've been eating better and I've lost ~60lbs. I'm learning more than ever and have the ability to move up in the company.
 Please remember that no job is worth your health. If you are not happy or your health, both physical or mental is declining, leaving is better than staying. Yes I'm aware that is easier said than done it took me almost 10 months to decide and actively look for another job but it worked out in the end.

 This time I put my name in the hat as did another coworker (he applied the first time as well but was passed up.)
 I met with our CTO today and was told that the organization was going with the coworker over me, essentially because of seniority even though I’d be a better fit.
 This is a guy who
  
Calls people on their days off because he’s too lazy to spend five minutes looking for an answer
 Has to be told/shown multiple times to do something (I’m starting to wonder if he can read and write)
 Does nothing to improve things and does not work smart
 Won’t take ownership of stuff and will try anything to push work off to others or weasel out of it
 Staff outside our main office specifically complain about him
  
What’s worse is I was given permission from our other coworkers on the team to use as a reference as well as a respected manager outside our group. I don’t believe he had any. While I haven’t seen his resume, I don’t believe he’s the better qualified candidate (other than being in IT longer.)
 The boss says the decision was not his and leadership/hr overruled him.
 I may give it a few months to see how things pan out but I’ll likely leave if I can find an employer who’ll match or beat my benefits.

 I installed an ER8411 VPN router in our office and I configured an IPsec VPN. My client device is a Windows 10 PC on another network. It connects to the VPN using TheGreenBow.
 I get good speeds, around 70 MB/s for file transfer, which is good for me.
 The problem I have is weird, and probably something I don't know. When I try copying a file from any remote device to my local client, it will allocate the client's ram for the size of that file. If I start a 5GB file copy, quickly the Ram usage will ramp up by 5GB. I need to transfer 60GB files, so that's a big issue. Once the transfer is done, it DOES NOT free the ram...
 I do not have that problem if I launch a copy from another drive or a local NAS.
 Any idea or explaination?
 Thanks!

 It seems like a waste of time having to answer IT questions through Teams chat when we can just find the answers quickly ourselves ya? Currently stuck with a minimal helpdesk system without any of these kinds of features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Was wondering if someone can provide an example of how to configure MEC on a Cisco C9500 that is configured in a StackWise Virtual Link, please? 
 For example: 
 In Arista, they use MLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation). I know how to configure MLAG in the Arista using Port Channel and MLAG configuration. To do so, I select the interface, for example, interface ethernet 2, under that interface, then I create the “channel-group 20“ with the number and mode. Then I move to the interface “port-channel 20”, and associate that port channel with the mlag number (let’s say 20 as well). I'll do the same on the second switch so both switches know they are part of an LACP/Port-Channel with MLAG connection in case switch one goes down. 
 Just need to know how I would configure MEC on the Cisco C9500 in a Stackwise Virtual mode.
 ​
 Thanks!

 The phone keeps ringing off the hook, and my half eaten Wendy's cheeseburger sits hardening on my desk. 
 I am paid 1/4 of what the people I'm helping are making, yet I am expected to know the inner workings of every software or complicated piece of equipment that they rely on.
 Ironically it is them who are allowed to slack off and complain to no end when something doesn't go their way.
 Every day there is another self important asshole who thinks their job is more important than everyone else's.
 Ironically, it is these same "overworked" and "stressed out" individuals whom I see heading to the cafeteria 10+ times a day, when I haven't finished my lunch in a week.
 I am only one man to 600 tech inept employees. 
 My question is, why is there no computer competency test for positions that are paying $100k + a year?? What is this absolute bullshit.

 I have a device on my facility floor that is using a Static IP of:
 10.239.134.177
 255.255.255.0
 10.239.134.1
 The DNS servers are set correctly as well.
 When I run an ipconfig /all
 I get 2x IPv4 Addresses:
 10.239.134.177 (Preferred)
 255.255.255.0
 Then I also get a second IPv4 Address:
 10.255.255.241 (Preferred)
 255.0.0.0
 It is causing issues on my network because the second address seems to be taking priority.
 When I reboot the machine it only shows 1 address, but after about 15 mins the network icon in the taskbar gets a yellow triangle saying (no internet) and when you run the ipconfig /all you see the second IP has come back.
 The device does have 2 NIC's but one of them is disabled and we are only using one.
 https://ibb.co/fX35xxM
 This is a link to the screenshot of the ipconfig.
 Thank you for any help you can provide.

 For context remote users use SonicWall VPN and my experience is the fastest fix is a simple reboot. Emailed instructions; will send texts if asked; I will even take a phone call and politely explain to reboot. "Hey just reboot and your issue will be solved. This thing just hangs up from time to time."
 After a few minutes The number of times I hear the words "Did that; same error" only to find their uptime being over a day is increasingly annoying. 
 This feels new and I think people are getting dumber and lazier. Been in IT 20+ years and I thought we'd be passed this.

 I am by no means a network professional but this has me curious. Could a hub cause problems for the rest of a network if used at its extreme reach, or is it ok so long as it doesn't cause problems among the devices it serves?

 No idea if other countries do this but in the UK its common for kids (age 15-17) before they go to college to do a week or two of 'work experience' .
 Anyway, this kid is coming here as he wants to get into IT and/or Dev so he's spending 2 days with our software engineers, 2 days with our test equipment design team (we're a manufacturing facility) and he's with me for one day on Monday. He gets to rate the experience so naturally there is some friendly competition amongst us as to which was more interesting, and I only get one day.
 ​
 What the hell do I trust a 16 year old child with that:
 - is engaging and not intensely boring
 - shows a good overview of what working in an 'IT' support/ops environment is like
 - can be explained quickly as time is limited
 - doesn't involve giving him the keys to the kingdom or other such compliance nightmares
 - doesn't involve me talking at him for 8 hours.
 - can be done in production because I'm not in tomorrow, only found out about this on Monday and haven't had time to set up any kind of lab he can happily break

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cisco switches in a school, we've got a port downstairs that is on the wrong vlan, but I can't find which switch and port in the MDF it connects to (previous admin set vlan by switch port as far as I can tell, but didn't label the patch panels or leave any documentation). I've tried show mac address-table on each one and see nothing. At this point I've connected a laptop downstairs that's on a continual ping so I know it has connectivity on the port, but I can't find the mac address for that laptop. Catalyst switches, mix of models. Any help appreciated, as a ton of small children are due to arrive any moment and make this job a lot more difficult.
 Edit: Issue resolved. Thanks everyone who responded. I'm sure this isn't the last you'll see of me, hopefully next time with smarter questions than I had today.

 As it stands the OS drives are in slots 1 and 2, with the rest being allocated to data.
 When I go to create the Logical Drives using Intelligent Provisioning, I can see that, there are 4 drives allocated to Port 1 on the RAID controller, 4 drives allocated to Port 2 on the RAID controller, and 2 drives connected to Port 3 on the RAID controller.
 The issue is that the x2 OS drives are intermixed with the x8 drives and not separated under port 3 for the expansion bay. Does it matter which drives are connected to which ports on the RAID controller? Or should I just be able to cut up into logical drives no matter where the drives are plugged in?
 Edit: and also from a sysadmin perspective, what would be the least confusing configuration for this setup. To have the OS drives in bays 1 and 2, or have them in the last slots 9 and 10 and be in the expansion bay.

 But i can't for the life of me figure out how to add on-call that's reoccurring every n weeks for each user.
 As it is now i have to update the schedule every 3 weeks, since i can only figure out how to add on-call for one specific weekend by adding it with dates.
 See the picture here for how i've done it so far.

 We have a Sharp BP-70C45
 ​
 And Odd thing is happening. We have MS365
 I have setup scan to email with smtp auth(Option1)
 I cannot use Direct Send(Option2) as it need to go to external recipeints as well
 I cannot use SMTP Relay(Option3) as it is a dynamic IP, I tried but it fails/does not work, even if I put the dynip on the sfp and connector
 ​
 So what is happening is I cannot scan to email to multiple recipients in my domain
 ie ([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com), [user2@mydomain.com](mailto:user2@mydomain.com)) it gives me a time out error on the printer
 ​
 I can send to a single recipient in my domain ([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com))
 I can send to multiple external recipients to any external domain([userext1@ext1.com](mailto:userext1@ext1.com), [user2@extother2.com](mailto:user2@extother2.com))
 ​
 But if I try to send to multiple users in my domain ie([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com), [user2@mydomain.com](mailto:user2@mydomain.com))
 it will give me a timeout error on the printer 
 OR 
 If I try to send to a mix of external([user1@somedomain.com](mailto:user1@somedomain.com)) and internal([user1@mydomain.com](mailto:user1@mydomain.com))
 It will send to the external but will give a timeout error for the internal. 
 ​
 So not sure if its something with the printer or MS365, anyone seen something like this before

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 Just looking for some advice. I have been looking at creating an internal Ansible infrastructure from scratch for our small team. The master server setup and inventory is quite easy and the box is easily screwed down re: the security as far as OS and access for certain groups, correct access rights, logging, locked down firewalls as well. You know, the sane usual settings.
 One thing that really worries me is the fact that in order to use the Ansible setup properly we are going to have to create keys that have no password, are exempted from 2FA rules and can switch to root level access. 
 The information on these servers "is the business" so if our data got lost it would be the end of the business if that makes sense. If the box got compromised it would be game over.
 In order to get the key they would have to exploit some creds to get into the box but its the sheer lateral movement/access that is gotten if these keys are misappropriated that worries me.
 Thoughts?

 ​
 This whole Exchange Online / Hybrid-Configuration topic has been bugging me for a long time now. I hope someone might be able to help me.
 ​
 Following scenario: We have a Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online and an on-prem Active Directory (NO AD Connect). So at the moment we always have to create two users: one for the M365 tenant / Exchange Online and one user for the on-prem AD.
 ​
 Is it possible to merge the on-prem AD users with the M365 users? I did find some tutorials on how to configure Azure AD Connect using soft and hard matching. BUT: I also read on some forum, that you must have an on-prem exchange in order for it to work properly (no further information was given). This on-prem Exchange is just used for communication between Exchange Online and the on-prem environment (no mailboxes etc. needed). How do I have to configure that on-prem Exchange? Just install it, configure hybrid mode and start creating users withing on-prem Exchange? Do I have to license the on-prem Exchange?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

 I've been working in an engineering team for a few years now (ISP). Mostly phasing out older stuff, helping out our SD teams and working on incidents that occurred. Also we're occasionally involved with on-boarding new clients, fitting their needs. And other projects (think: new PoPs etc).
 Honestly, it kinda feels 'stale'. I like to play new shiny stuff once in a while. play around with it, see if it fits our use. For example software/tooling for QoL, other hardware, else. 
 Reflecting on other engineering teams in other branches e.g. motorsports; they have engineers with a clear goal: win a race within certain rules. I don't think we (as NWE's) always have these clear rules. There is -however- one clear goal: it has to work. It mostly does not matter how (no clear rules).
 How would one create some kind of 'race' to squeeze every bit from a router. Having no jitter, or making sure you lose no packets in transit? Otherwise, i don't really feel being an engineer but more like a janitor.

 Downgrading the firmware back to 219.0.29.0 and then the nics showed up in VmWare
 Quite a big problem if server is unusable out of box and promised fix is coming by the end on April.

 I don't know if the community of r/sysadmin might help with my issue, see it as a message in a bottle and mods feel free to delete if it doesn't fit this sub requirements! 
 I'm having huge trouble with a OOM issue when running MariaDB :
 - Server specs : https://pastebin.com/qXCbBWLM
 - InnoDB Status : https://pastebin.com/p9aNVWqT
 - MySQLTuner report: https://pastebin.com/xfvVt1Nv
 The main issue is that even though MariaDB is allocated 20Gb for 'innodb_buffer_pool_size', it goes way up in memory consumption leading to this graph :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/5hxodSj)
 As we can see in this graph, it doesn't seem to be related to an activity spike :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/Y12CECY)
 And if we take a look at the buffer size (the issue started when the 'lowered' was 1Gb so we went for 24Gb and lowered it to 20Gb) :
 [Imgur](https://imgur.com/5hxodSj)
 I already tried to tweak some MariaDB configurations but struggle to find the culprit of this OOM issue. There is only MariaDB running on this server and the kernel log file shows me that only MariaDB is consuming RAM when the OOM occurs.
 Is this only an issue of too low RAM to run this database ?
 Any help is welcome and if I can provide any other information just ask, I'm getting reallllyyyy desperate ! Thank you for your reading and have a good day !

 I know that the client resolver on W10 switches to the second DNS server after trying and failing with the first server for 1 second. But when does it switch back? I know it does after a restart, but what about during regular operation? From my findings, Windows doesn't "balance" between servers. It sticks with the first one until the 1 second timeout.

 We have an on Prem AD server which sync's out users to AAD using Azure AD Connect.
 Recently the On Prem AD server went pop which obviously has stopped the sync. My plan over the course of the next month was to Fully migrate away from the on Prem server anyway as there is no need for it any more. All of our Microsoft services are cloud based. We have no on site applications. All machines are connected via Azure and linked up to intune. So really all we use the on Prem server for is creating accounts. 
 My question is... What would the implications be of just leaving the server in its current state seeing as though I was going to be getting rid of it anyway. Do the current users get converted to Cloud users automatically 
 ...or is it advisable to restore from backups and carry out the steps of stopping syncs at both ends etc.
 Thanks

 Our CIO left the company and the process to find a new one just finished and they landed with a CIO with 20+ years of experience in the field, after a few talks with the new CIO and he seems to have a lot of knowledge.
 My only issue is that he decided to change our entire OS infrastructure, from Windows to ChromeOS. I've asked him why the change, he said "ChromeOS is more secure and faster".
 I've never used ChromeOS, so I don't know what to expect on it. 
 I'm half tempted to learn the OS to improve my skills and knowledge, but at the same time, I don't wanna waste time learning something that I might not use much in the future if I change jobs or he leaves (the previous company where he worked started the transition back to windows after he left, the employees weren't happy with ChromeOS). 
 What do you guys think on this transition and what would you do in my shoes?

 The only exception was one particular vm Win Server 2019 on which a CRM was running and presenting a smb share to the users, from which they could start the applications.

 <ValueQueries> <Value name='User'>Event/UserData/EventXML[@Name="User"]</Value> </ValueQueries>

 I also tried "%username%" but this one is always filled with one special user (I do not know, why) and not with the "reconnecting" user.

 The only options I've found so far is NetGate TNSR appliances, or Ubiquiti ER-8-XG-US.
 Edit: Cheaper would be <$10k USD or around that target.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am dealing with a fairly large Nutanix infrastructure 40+ nodes across several clusters and locations. We use it like you you would use a vmware or any other hypervisor to just run VMs. Nothing special no fancy services or scripting. 
 When I say every single upgrade I have done has failed or taken 8+ hours for something that should be 2 at the most, I mean every single upgrade. I can't find a single redeeming quality to this system. Every issue requires SSH access to the controller VMs, and either a pile of CLI or direct intervention from their support staff. In a 10+ year career I've never talked to support so much in such a short amount of time. Every firmware upgrade of the underlying host turns into a multi hour nightmare with crazy 2+ hour timeouts before a failure message. Every single feature down to what should be the simplest thing is manual, or a ratking of python scripts behind a sleek UI with bad progress reporting. Something as easy as upgrading the VM guest tools is a manual process with no automation. 
 I don't understand, what's the value add? How is this company maintaining customers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that it has been said that one doesn't "recover" from ransomware, one "restores" from ransomware, if possible. But I want to think outside the box a bit; can we put some more safeguards on exactly who can encrypt data? Can we wholesale disallow via GPO the use of encryption on the OS? Can the OS/Admin have a system-wide "skeleton key" that can decrypt data regardless of encryption keys used? It can't just be about backups and malware prevention, cybersecurity needs to neutralize the threat itself, to de-fang encryption-abuse. Is anybody in cybersecurity thinking along these lines?

 We are a smallish organisation with 20 sites + 1 Datacenter headend all on MPLS. We currently have all the backup IPSec tunnels terminating on the core router (network core and MPLS headend) in the DC but I am looking to move the tunnels to a new/repurposed router to avoid SPOF.
 We have onprem (Datacenter) domain controllers and Office365/Azure AD in a hybrid setup.
 Hardware:
 Core router - Juniper SRX4600 in HA
 Repurposed Router - Juniper SRX1500 in HA
 The SRX4600 is beastly enough to handle the existing and future tunnels but I am just looking at a cleaner way to tie everything in. FYI - We are in locked in for a further 3 years with our MPLS provider.
 What is everyone doing nowadays with backup tunnels (besides ditching MPLS altogether for SDWAN and SASE/CASB :))

 back story I created a payment website for an association and used a local merchant for the online payment processing portion.
 I have an email drafted and ready to go to his boss but what would ya'll do? Should I just reply to him and tell him I can't do this or is it better that his boss knows he's trying to get me to pretend I still work at the company by calling the merchant and letting them know to increase the limit of the online payment processor.

 cut over to a new firewall and moved the L3 interfaces from the router to the firewall behind a transit vlan 
 Prior to the cutover the interfaces were all being advertised out on bgp using network statement and route policy. Upon moving the interface to the firewall it appears that the router is no longer advertising those subnets into the BGP peering. Why could this be?
 Changes made: Transit subnet/interfaces created on router Static routes added to point routers to new location of the subnets Old interfaces deleted
 Troubleshooting: Pings to otherside of transit interface - pass Routes in local table - pass Advertised routes - fail

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time lurker and first time poster. Thought I would cross post this from the K12 page just to see what insight you all could provide too.
 Looking into new wireless hardware for this next fall for my district. I feel like reviews are all over the place... I'm hoping maybe you all can share your experience and advice on what has worked best for your district.
 We are a small district. Two buildings with 1200 students and 200 staff. Our environment is somewhat mixed. Students are 1to1 iPad, staff are 1to1 Mac Air, Chromebooks for assistants, and office staff have windows desktops.
 We are currently running 3 year old Aruba switches and 2 year old Unifi AC HD AP's. While I really haven't had many issues with the AP's, used Unifi in other districts and businesses for the last 8 years, I'm concerned UBNT may not be as focused as they use to be on the networking end.
 I'm considering staying with Unifi and purchasing U6 Enterprise AP's. Testing with them so far has gone well in classroom.
 But, I've also been considering Ruckus, Extreme or maybe Aruba based on bids I've received (I don't have any experience with any of those 3) I have had Meraki and I'm not a fan of the Meraki licensing model or hardware.
 Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been experiencing a strange DHCP issue the last few days. We are using Juniper Ex4300s as an L3 gateway, with UniFi access switching and wireless.
 Clients will send DHCP Discover to the router, which is then relayed to a Windows DHCP server. The server then sends an Offer, which is received by the client.
 This is where we run into issues. The client sends a DHCP Request, but the request never makes it to the Juniper gateway. This is mostly affecting our WiFi, so I am thinking it is the UniFi APs, but I haven't been able to find a resolution to this issue.
 DHCP Snooping is disabled. We have tested several different firmware versions on the APs, to no avail.
 EDIT: This is affecting wired clients as well.

 'show switch' shows all switches are a part of the stack no problem.
 ' show switch stack-ports' shows all is good with the stack cables
 Nothing in the logs is showing anything out of the ordinary, except for %SPI_FC-3-HIGH_WMARK_REACHED: Number of messages in the queue for channel 11 has reached maximum. Which i'm reading is a known bug on this code... shouldn't be an issue with stacking.
 We're able to reload all other switches individually with 'reload slot x' command, and reloading all other switches (except for the primary, because we dont want to reload the working one during business hours) didn't seems to fix it. After reloading the other member switches, they join back into the stack just fine. 
 ​
 The member switches' ports are simply just not coming up. It's showing no link activity like there's no cable even plugged in. Tried bouncing the ports, and unplugging/replugging in cables, no luck.
 ​
 Has anyone ever ran into this? The plan is to reboot the whole stack tonight after work hours to see if that fixes, which i'm hoping it does. It has an uptime of 2 years also.
 Any advice would be appreciated!!
 EDIT:: The reboot fixed it! Of course next step is to get them upgraded. Thanks for the responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We've had Cisco routers on order for over a year now and their ETA keeps getting pushed further out. I am wondering how prevalent different virtual router products such as VyOS, TNSR, or even CSR1K/CSR8K are in the enterprise non cloud environment for replacing traditional ethernet routers used for internet edge and private WAN connectivity. I understand there are some (very) large and small businesses that make use of them, but would like to understand how "ready" are they to replace traditional hardware-based internet/WAN routers? Most discussions around VyOS tend to be around home use rather than enterprise and VyOS/TNSR seem to be only occasionally mentioned in enterprise networking related discussions.
 Also, does anyone have experience with technical support for either? VyOS looks to be < $20K per year for unlimited installs and 1-4Hr support SLA. I feel I'd have a better time convincing management to try a products other than Cisco if they can be assured that they have decent support. There also aren't many concrete performance numbers published for VyOS but anecdotal evidence suggests that 10Gbps+ should be achievable even when hosted on ESXi. Are there any "gotchas" to look forward to with hosting any of these on ESXi as far as functionality, stability, and performance?
 Thank you all for taking the time to read this.

 I'm suffering with speed client speed issues with one of our stacks of Dell5548 switches (5 members).
 This presents as speed tests (iperf to a server, another client on the same stack or to WAN) performing at 0Mbps-990Mbps (speed fluctuates massively per second per client).
 We have 2 10Gbps fibre uplinks from our core in a port-channel, I've tried shutting each of these in turn to see if its a link issue but obviously the issue persists on the stack itself so I don't think its a link issue.
 The switches are stacked in "Ring" (port 1 on switch 1 to port 2 on switch 2, down to switch 5 where port 1 goes back to port 2 switch 1).
 I've tried enabling BDPUGuard on all non-trunk ports to no avail. Our core stack is our root bridge for RSTP. I've added (and then removed) portfast fro…]]></summary>

 First question — it’s a fairly small office. In total we’ll have less than 20 dynamic clients and we’re currently using a Meraki device. What hardware will I need to accomplish this? 
 Second — for shared resources (i.e., printers) what’s the easiest way to have a device span multiple vlans in this way?

 My situation
 Worked my way through the standard sysadmin role to now being more of an IT (project) management role.
 I work in an international organization with IT colleagues spread in lots of countries.
 I am working from HQ but mostly my role is supporting/managing local IT colleagues and to make their life easier.
 These local IT colleagues purchase hardware based on HQ recommendations mostly, albeit these are often not hard recommendations - in areas like accessories (keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.) there is a lot of flexibility on purchasing whatever fits the local organization best, although there are selected recommendations in some areas.
  
 We want to provide all IT colleagues with a repository of recommended hardware in all general categories.
 What would be the best way to go about doing that?
 Ideally it should:
 * Cover basic information for all relevant device models divided in categories (mouse, keyboard, etc.)
 * Provide reviews/insights from other local IT colleagues (e.g. 5-star rating, comments/reviews)
 * Include links to our recommended resellers for purchase
  
 We do have confluence and SharePoint available as tools.
 I don't have much experience with SharePoint myself and I do know that confluence will struggle once you work with lots of information on a single page (especially tables) - which is bound to happen after some time of adding hardware to the list.
 Neither of these options (at least as far as I can tell) would provide an easy way of achieving the goal.
 We also have ServiceNow but I don't think this use-case fits an ITSM solution.  
  
 Did any of you do something similar already?
 If yes, how did you do it?
  
 I appreciate any input you could share with me! :)

It would need to be able to inventory servers (both Windows and Linux), switches (HP/Aruba), access points (Aruba), firewalls (Palo Alto), printers, and maybe a few other device types. This solution would need to be able to scan multiple subnets, and preferably filter out just the device types mentioned (for instance, I don't need this tool to inventory desktops/laptops).
 As a bonus, does anyone know of any software that could scan web servers and keep an inventory of all websites hosted on those servers (we are a state agency, and host a LOT of websites)? This can be a separate solution from the above recommendations.
 Thanks for the help!

 Does anyone have any experience with docking stations that work? I'm going crazy trying to find a proper docking station that works reliably.. 
 I've tried so many different devices, all kinds of Lenovo to Iiglo to belkin. I just purchased a Lenovo 32" monitor with built in docking and it works great, but it doesn't have an ethernet port or any display output for daisy chaining several screens which is a big minus.

 currently i'm trying to set up the connection to multiple NFS-Shares on the same Server (This setup is non-negotiatible)
 First i set up the connection to 1 NFS-Share which worked fine after some tweaking. A part of this journey was to create 2 keys in
 HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\Default
 The keys are "AnonymousUID" and "AnonymousGID".
 Now the Problem is that with a different NFS-Share i will have different GID's, but regedit doesnt allow a second key with the same name.
 How i can i make this work with 2 different GID-values?

 I'm trying to connect 4 different iscsi targets provided by a NAS with powershell. I don't want to connect them all at once but rather separately, one at a time (first target1, then target2 and so on).
 So far I've had success geting the target names with get-iscsitarget and piping this to a select-string which then chooses the target I want to connect (target1 for the first target). I then pipe that to connect-iscsitarget but here's my problem: This will assign the first available driveletter to the target. I want to assign specific letters, for example target1 gets W:, target2 gets X: and so on).
 But I cannot for the life of me find the command needed for this. All I can find is how to get driveletters from already connected targets and similat stuff.
 Any ideas? Am I missing something here?
 Thanks and have a good one!

 I was wondering if AD CS has an option to revoke an old certificate if a computer requests a new computer certificate.
 We have several machines who are getting rebuild every week which request a certificate with our CA. I would like to have the certificates which got request before the client got re-installed to be revoked, but I dont see any option which allows me to do this.
 Does anyone know if this is an option within AD CS?

What is the best way to take a golden config and push out something that ensures all other switches have exactly the same config as the golden switch?
 We have Cisco Prime, not sure if that has a feature to do this. But I am also somewhat comfortable with python and ansible. I know with ansible, I have done ansible diff to find differences, just not sure how to go about enforcing changes based off that.
 Just trying to find an easier way than wiping all the switches and putting a new config on them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Yesterday we had an alert from Microsoft 365 Defender (our Licenses are on 365 E5) notifying us of “Ransomware-linked emerging threat activity group detected “. Yikes!
 To cut a long story short, our security stack has contained the threat and the single device in question is nuked – We looped in 3rd party security to sense check everything.
 The threat was a Gootloader infection and Google suggests this is particularly nasty and sophisticated. The payload is a zip file with a .js file inside and from our investigation, the .js script needs to be executed, launched via WScriptexe. We implement best practice in our IT stack and are on-top of hardening our environment where ever possible. In this instance the payload was downloaded to a temp directory where Applocker blocks execution. But had the zip/.js file been downloaded to the desktop, it would have potentially executed.
 1 suggested rudimentary mitigation for this is to change the file association of .js files (via Group Policy) to open with Notepad so if a user does click a .js file, it will harmlessly open in notepad - We have done this. 
 But I have seen further recommendations to do the same for .vbs, .vbe, .jse, .hta and .wsf. I’m wondering if anyone else does this and if this could break anything for end users?

 My boss has handed me his old work issued Samsung A10 that is completely locked down using SOTI mobicontrol. The kicker is that the company that this phone belongs to doesn't exist anymore and so we are unable to get an admin to unlock the phone. Furthermore, I have contacted SOTI directly and because the company doesn't exist anymore they don't have permission to unlock it so they can't help me.
 I can't seem to figure out a way to unlock it - they have me beat at every turn.
 - Developer options is blocked
 - In recovery mode, there is no option to factory reset the phone
 - I am able to get into the settings for about a minute before the mobicontrol kicks in when I restart the phone - otherwise settings is completely disabled
 - The factory reset setting is completely greyed out.
 - In recovery mode, the bootloader is blocked out | when I try to open it, it just says downloading forever with a green screen
 Any methods I can try to get this phone reset or alternatively get soti mobicontrol off the device? Or is the device doomed for eternity?
 Any help would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Without going into detail, I gave a family member of mine a beautiful enterprise laptop that I got for free out of a HW refresh a few years ago. For some reason this relative decided rather than going to me when they had a problem they would run straight to the local "repair shop" as he apparently was chatted up by one of their staff while he was at the chippy.
 This "repair shop" (and I use this dubiously) has made a fucking botch to put it lightly. They claimed he had a virus and that his "hard drive" (actually an SSD) was destroyed by it and he would need a replacement which he happily agreed to. They installed a "new" hard drive and sent it back to him, obviously with slower performance on acc. of having an SSD swapped for a HDD and no effort made to reinstall any of the laptop's basic drivers which can be pulled off the manufacturer's site with a few minutes on Googles, so this relative had no sound, no WiFi (lucky they use a cable connection, really!) and a prompt to activate Windows.
 When they took it back, they had the sense to call me this time. When I went back with this relative, they had kindly replaced his hard drive with a "solid state drive" and would only charge him £150, what a fucking deal! I actually had a look at the laptop at the shop and it was in the same state as before, no effort to reinstall any drivers, probably was just the same SSD they took out reinstalled and sold back to him at cost, and a prompt to activate Windows. I quite bluntly told them to fuck off, gave them an earful and walked out with my relative and the laptop in tow. Considering either legal or lethal action to get these tw@s to stop bothering him.
 Also, the fucking screws are threaded on the underside so good luck to me getting into that fucker again. At least they had the decency to install another SSD but that's nearly £100 of this relative's money down the fucking drain.

 I think this is very excessive in terms of cost, but I am not 100% what is involved so maybe it is correct.
 Does anybody have experience with this and can indicate if this cost is reasonable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 we currently have a strange issue.
 Our customer has 6 AVD session hosts with FSLogix in use.
 The issue: Sometimes a specific program won't start anymore on the vm a user is connected to. They have to connect with one of the other session hosts. On that session host it works for 1-2 days and afterwards the same issue occurs.
 The software is not installed on the vms but is started directly from a mapped network drive. It doesn't add or edit registry keys and only caches files in one specific folder in AppData. We already excluded that folder from the FSLogix redirection but it didn't make a difference.
 The only solution that works is to delete the FSLogix profile and create a new one.
 Additionally, Excel doesn't seem to work great either. Users have to restart it every few minutes because of freezing and crashing. Same thing, if the FSLogix profile will be deleted and be newly created it works again for a few days.
 So it seems there is something wrong with FSLogix. We already updated to the newest version and tried both normal caching and cloud cache.
 Weirdly I couldn't find anything or anyone on google regarding to this issue.
 Did anyone of you experience similiar issues or has an idea how to fix this? 
 Thanks in advance.

 We have Roaming Profiles and Folder Redirection reasonably heavily deployed amongst our on-premises clients. Recently a number of our long term staff who were very experienced with setting these up and troubleshooting issues with these have left, and the replacements we hired have no experience. RP and FR have been pretty stable for us, but we get a couple of issues a month I guess, and we aren't really having much luck getting on top of them. 
 I am keen to track down some resources on setting up and troubleshooting Roaming Profiles, including slow logins, errors regarding logging on with locally cached profile, and other common issues like a new profile directory being created locally each time a user logs in.
 I'd also be interested in tracking down information on how to turn off roaming profiles if we want to stop using them, without losing the profile data and just general troubleshooting in this area. 
 Totally happy to pay for training materials, just really keen to get the new people up to snuff so we don't spend hours and hours troubleshooting and or fixing RP Issues.

 we have had a strange problem with our print server (Win2019 1809) for quite some time.
 If employees try to print a document in the morning, it is sent to the print server, but not printed out immediately. The document is not printed until an admin connects to the server via RDP connection. After the RDP connection, all documents are printed out. This applies to all printers that are connected via a print server.
 1.) The print server can be reached permanently via ping, even in the morning.
 2.) LAN card (Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power) is not checked.
 3.) VMware Tools up to date
 I suspect that during the night some service hangs up. However, I have no idea which one.
 Have you already had a similar phenomenon and can you give me a tip in which event log I can find it?

 Im working at a startup selling saas. 
 We have just got our first client in eu and are looking at more in other countries and struggling to figure out how to respect data sovereignty. 
 We have a very basic IIS server mysql server and this runs everything. We would like to place a server in eu and other countries, and store the data and files for those countries users, on those servers.
 The catch is, there is a few "global" databases that need to be accessed on all servers. 
 Running the application on our current server and using a database in another country does not seem to work well due to latency. I have tested installing IIS on this second location, using a different domain and connecting back to our global databases so only certain requests have additional latency. 
 But this all seems really stupid, surely there is a better way.

 https://imgur.com/dYSzKUo
 We can assume that each NIC is assigned a route table with a UDR that points 0.0.0.0/0 to the respective IP (load balancer IPs) shown in the diagram. We can assume that the NVA's are running active/active and are configured as backend pool members for each load balancer in the diagram.
 ​
 If both of the load balancer back end pools are configured in the following order:
 Load balancer in 10.0.0.0/24
  
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.0.10
 
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.0.11
 
 Load balancer in 10.0.1.0/24 
  
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.1.10
 
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.1.11
 
 What would be the effect, if any, upon traffic if the order of one of the back-end pool members were reversed so that it is displayed as follows:
 Load balancer in 10.0.1.0/24 
  
NVA-Secondary-NIC 10.0.1.11
 
NVA-Primary-NIC 10.0.1.10
 
 ​
 To provide context, I am trying to understand in what instances does the order of the backend pool on azure load balancers impact and effect traffic flow, and what considerations need to be understood here for this to make sense.
 I would appreciate the communities thoughts on this to help my understanding on this subject.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm lets say a little rusty on routing, was just looking for conformation. sorry if my terminology is not spot on.
 I have an layer 3 switch (Aruba 8320) at the core of my network, it is doing all the routing and is configured with the final route as 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.0.18 (my firewall), however I want to re-route the traffic from VLAN 66 (10.66.0.0/21) to another device (different interface on firewall, as I can enable a captive portal for that vlan only). if these two devices are directly connected I assume the I do the following to re-route the traffic.
 Configure firewall interface: 192.16.30.5/29
 Configure layer 3 switch interface: 192.168.30.6/29
 Configure route in layer 3 switch: ip route 10.66.0.0/21 192.168.30.5
 the bit I'm unsure of is do I need to configure a vlan for 19.168.30.0/29
 interface vlan 30
 description Guest_Wireless_VLAN
 ip address 192.168.30.2/29
 active-gateway ip mac e2:ff:5e:ac:09:07
 active-gateway ip 192.168.30.1
 and change the route to: ip route 10.66.0.0/21 192.168.30.1 or keep it the same
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I would like to know your opinion regarding how change and risk management is done in your organizations. I am particularly interested in risk management (not security risk but potential impacts due to change).
 The ITIL framework is useful however there is an element that I struggle with, potential customers impacts, normally when defining potential, we might think as the worst case scenario, but even small simple changes could have big potential impact if we consider a typo when adding a new policy in an existing vrf, someone might say deleting or modifying policies are riskier, and I would normally agree, but when it comes to typos, missing a statement, wrong IP, community tag, etc, could have severe consequences.
 In my organization we have defined these categories to come with a number, the number will fall under ITIL thresholds, P1-P4, these are the categories:
 Potential Customer Impact, it is based on the activity being performed and the amount of customers potentially impacted.
 Type Element, it is a grouping that depends on type of element, for example, a core IP layer element would have higher value than a Voice or Data(Application layer) element.
 Service Area, based on the geographical area that the element is providing services, example, it could be region of a country, a state, it could be within a city.
 Service Density, amount of actual services that the element is supporting.
 As you can see, Type, Service Area and Service Density are based on the element where the work is going to be performed, but the Potential Customer Impact is based on the activity itself only.
 My struggle is finding a good balance in the risk management for the activity itself as there are many details like typos or missing small pieces of configuration that could create a big impact even though the activity itself could be a simple one. 
 How does your organization manage risk from changes? What ideas can you share with me based on the above?
 Thanks in advance.

 Currently I've got VRRP running with rfc3768 compatibility, which means vyos creates virtual interfaces with virtual mac addresses for the virtual address.
 Unfortunately rfc3768 comes with plenty of hoops and bugs on vyos currently and I was wondering what is the likely outcome if I disable rfc3768 support? keepalived will send GARP packages on failover and then resend it after a delay. Do you have experience with equipment missing/ignoring garp packets and not failing over?

 "I used to play pranks on people who didn't lock their computer. Now I just lock it for them. If I see someone in a coffee shop walk away and leave their computer unattended, rather than being a dick I just keep an eye on it until they come back"
 Obviously heavily paraphrased - but that was the jist of it. 
 I know it is a long shot - but I am trying to find this article again and drawing a complete blank. Every time I try to google it I get hundreds of pages of search results for the best pranks to pull on people who leave their computers unlocked.
 And yes - switching their mouse from right to left handed or rotating their screen 90 degrees is amusing, but not what I am looking for right now...
 Thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction.

I know I can create the VLANS and use IRB/SVI (logical ports) for the VLAN routing and connect the switches with trunk links and setup some DHCP forwarding (ip-helper) addresses on the IRB interfaces to leverage the DHCP ranges on the Fortigate 100F, But I wasn't sure about the connection from the switch to the Fortigate. Is that considered a trunk link too? I would think it would just be a standard link and then you have the routing to the VLANs setup on the router with static/dynamic routes or whatever. Or is there an easier way to do this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 I thought it was a standard phishing mass attack posing as a bank then hitting lots of people to try to get people with an account there, but after looking into it they're actually coming from Capital One. At least they're coming from the same IPs and domains as confirmed legit Capital One emails. 
 So far we've gotten at least a hundred of these emails. They have all the looks of a phishing campaign. They're hitting old and disabled accounts as well as current legit ones. 
 There's nothing malicious I've found in the emails. The embedded links all go to the correct sites. So I'm not sure what the point of the emails are. 
 I've reached out to their abuse email address, but doubt I'll hear much back. 
 Has anyone else seen anything going on like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Recently I've configured HSRP on our core switches. Because of the physical limitations of our fiber connections, we only have one trunk interface as the heartbeat interface between the two core switches. I set Core Sw1 as primary for all VLANs and Core Sw2 as the secondary for all VLANs. The configurations were successful and when I pull the ethernet cable going to our ASA, the traffic still flows through Core Sw2. However, when I unplug Core Sw1, we lose connection on the entire network. 
 Quickly explaining our Core to ASA connection: the connection from Core Sw1 and Core Sw2 is a single cable connection from each of the Core Switch. We only have one ASA running on the network at the moment.
 What could be causing this problem? I brought up setting up STP root manually so that the VLANs have a cost to follow to the Distribution then to Core Switches, but my Supervisor is insisting that doesn't matter. If I can get a clear technical explanation as to why our failover isn't happening when Core Sw1 loses power it will be very helpful.

 I have 2x 2019 domain controllers. Deployed and promoted 2x 2022 DC's. Waited a few days for replication to happen. Moved FSMO roles to the new DC's, demoted the first 2019 DC. Shutdown the 2nd 2019 server... then all hell broke loose. Apparently, the 2 new DC's are still waiting for initial replication to complete. The old 2019 server is saying it's been 392 days since it connected with a partner and won't replicate with any others until it does so.
 I screwed up by not checking my DC logs before shutting removing the first DC. Let that be a lesson to everyone doing an upgrade. Always check your logs.
 Now I am stuck with 2 DC's who are waiting for initial replication to complete with another DC who thinks it is too out of date to talk to anyone. What are my options? How can I tell the old DC that it can replicate with other devices? Can I force the new DC's to believe what they have been transferred is a complete sync?
 EDIT:
 I was able to resolve my issue by going on to the 2019 DC and changing the MaxOfflineTimeInDays to beyond the number of days that the DC thought it had been disconnected by issuing the following command and then restarting the DFSR service:
 wmic.exe /namespace:\\root\microsoftdfs path DfsrMachineConfig set MaxOfflineTimeInDays=450
 After that, I forced replication on both the new 2022 DC's who were able to complete initial synchronization. Thanks to everyone for their help!

 My original plan was to use spare Meraki MS120's as the breakouts, but the MSP said it was a bad idea due to licensing, despite me showing them a known working config for exactly this use case. Instead they recommended 2 dumb L2 switches.
 I'm not a network person specifically, but I can handle the basics of Meraki. I'm just not sure what config is needed for these 1000's.
 If I follow what my plan was for the MS120's, this is what the config would look like for the 1000's
 How wrong is this? And if this is somehow the right idea, I'm assuming there is more to do on the config...any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All. We are an IT consulting form and commonly perform site surveys for clients. Most of our clients have small to medium sized sites with between 5-20 APs. Lots of small warehouse clients that we do this for.
 Currently we use free predictive wireless heatmapping tools, and the free Wi-Fi analyzer tool to provide heatmaps and recommendations to clients. We basically use the existing AP placements and predictive heatmap tool to make an approximated heat map, then go onsite and use Wi-Fi analyzer to confirm the accuracy of the predictive heatmap and look for interference and optimal channels to set. It's pretty manual but fairly easy/not complex for us to do.
 Also we help them by recommending Wi-Fi settings such as the channels, etc. This has seemingly been enough for our clients and they've been happy with the results. We're able to make plenty of recomendations using our method.
 We've actually had clients tell us that another competitor came in and did a survey with other (paid) tools and the reports were overly confusing to them and took too long.
 We're starting to raise our prices for site surveys more towards what our competitors are charging, so I'm looking into paid site survey tools to see if they can provide anymore value to clients or efficiency on our end. 
 What would ya'll recommend? We do around 1-2 surveys a month, mostly for small clients like I described above. I would prefer something cloud based, something we can easily install/license on our laptops (for our team of 5 engineers), no physical tool, and affordable (don't think we need something like Ekahau for these smaller surveys?). Right now I'm looking at NetSpot. 
 Please let me know what you would recommend and why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 We are writing to inform you that a vulnerability has been discovered within a Veeam® Backup & Replication™ component that could allow an unauthenticated user request encrypted credentials that could lead to them gaining access to backup infrastructure hosts. This affects all Veeam Backup & Replication versions. 
 We have developed patches for V11 and V12 to mitigate this vulnerability and we recommend you update your installations immediately. If you are not the current manager of your Veeam environment, please forward this email to the proper person. If you use an all-in-one Veeam appliance with no remote backup infrastructure components, you can also block external connections to port TCP 9401 in the backup server firewall as a temporary remediation until the patch is installed. 
 Veeam has a long-standing commitment to ensuring our products protect customers from any potential risk. As part of this, we run a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) for all our products. In mid-February, a security researcher identified and reported this vulnerability for Veeam Backup & Replication v11 and v12 with a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating high severity. We immediately reviewed and confirmed the vulnerability and developed an update that resolves the issue.

 Networking past a layer 2/3 switch. I'm plenty capable of doing all kind of fancy things with networks, but truthfully I just hate it. I can't stand doing network planning and carving out subnets, managing VIPs, QoS, all the VLANs, etc. etc. It's just boring and tedious to me. I learned my lesson early when I temporarily took over for a netadmin position at a previous job while we looked for a new one. Never again.

 -OSPF adjecency fully established-No routes received over OSPF adjacency on either end-Traffic goes the long way around
 Cause:
 -I have accidentally skipped adding the OSPF point to point subinterface to 'mpls ldp'.
 Question: Why did OSPF not send routes over a P2P subinterface, even when an adjacency was fully established, just because I skipped putting the subinterface into MPLS(accidentaly)? It seems that this is happening even before route-path-cost calculations.
 FYI it is fixed now. And it was the same on OSPFv3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a result of a merger, we're moving two schools into the same new building and we're planning the new network accordingly. Within the first couple years, the two schools will operate independently, however staff from both schools will be sharing staffrooms, printers, libraries and halls. We want to ensure that, whatever the solution, network resources belonging to the two schools are safely kept isolated.
 At the moment, one school is running users and computers in a Windows Workgroup in a very simple scenario, while the second school has a more advanced setup, which is depicted here: https://i.ibb.co/8XVYw3F/unnamed-1.jpg
  
Core LAN (not into a VLAN) for on premise trusted Windows devices and AD servers
 Staff VLAN, for BYOD devices and mobile phones
 Guest VLAN for students :school chromebooks and BYOD
 Printers VLAN, shared with the above LANs and VLANs, inbound only traffic
 PBX VLAN, runs traffic from DECT and softphones
  
Assuming that, as for the merger, users and computers from the first school will be moved into an AD Domain, we could think of two possible choices:
  
Logically segregate users and computers using two domains, and two "zones", which implies duplicating the above network design. Manage two domains, two isolated groups of WIFI networks, plus a shared network, which would be more tedious to manage, but maybe more secure, or
 Integrate users and computers into a unique domain, manage a shared network infrastructure, ensuring that a granular and hardened access control to resources is in place. More flexible, but more prone to "attacks" if not properly designed
  
Of course, brand new network appliances will be thrown in: switches, APs, routers and firewalls.
 With all the above in mind, what solution would you choose? What are your suggestions?

 Do I just use IP addresses within the same subnet I use for the BGP peering or do I use private IPv4 addresses and then CGNAT?

 I have a design question here… seeking wisdom to prevent me from possibly painting myself into a corner. Regarding the phase 1 ikev2 policies, specifically on the Cisco ASA… how should the order look and is there a better way to number all of them?
 Like should a more secure policy be a lower index number than a less secure policy? If you order and index them poorly – could anything be impacted?
 I guess there have been 3 network engineers here in the last 2 years and I see very random numbering... even a random ass Policy 71... it just screams bad design to me but I'm not familiar with the topic well enough to pin point it.
 Any tips/wisdom is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if this is going to apply to anyone but if you are using a on-premise Radius/MFA Server in a Microsoft environment I highly recommend transitioning to SAML. 
 In particular my company just upgraded from some old ASAs to a MX-105 in HA, it was a bitch to set up the static routes between a old Cisco switch and a MX. One of the perks is being able to configure SAML in Azure AD. It just seems like alot more wholesome and customizable way to allow and configure Anyconnect VPN access with MFA. 
 Feel free to comment or DM me if you have any questions or want help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be a long shot... But I'm hoping that somewhere out there, someone has faced the same issue and maybe even found a fix.
 We have a bunch of Windows 10 Pro clients, and some Windows 11 Pro clients, which were initially on-prem domain joined, but have since become hybrid joined with AAD.
 My issue is that our users (about 500) have license for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, but only about half of the clients are running Business, the rest is stuck on Pro.
 Now, for some reason, it's exceptionally difficult to find any documentation on how this edition change actually works or should happen. Everything on MS, both on Learn and TechNet concerns Enterprise only, and even our CSP's licensing experts couldn't give a straight answer. (The first guy I spoke to, even claimed that there was no such thing as "Windows 10 Business"... o.O )
 Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a KMS key specifically for "Business", because if there was, I could just have the clients run a slmgr script silently, and that'd be the end of it -- and "just buy E3" (as another "expert" from our CSP suggested) is not en option either.
 Any insights, pointers or even encouraging comments are highly welcome and greatly appreciated.

Therefore, I would like to hear your thoughts on what features are lacking in existing tools, like Windows Admin Center or any other tools you use, that you believe should be included in a Hyper-V manager app.

 I am reaching out to ask what would be a nice thing to do for some admins that helped me out. Quick background, I started a new job a few months ago and was put in charge of building up a small mobile network with VMs, VoIPs, printers, WiFi, etc. I had a few people that came in and helped me put it all together. We had our first event recently and were complimented on how well everything ran. There were some issues to iron out but for the most part, it went really well. What would be the best way to thank them for their efforts? Keep in mind, they are not part of my organization, I am not a manager in anyway, I have no power to increase their salaries or get them a bonus. Thinking either taking them out to dinner or getting them each a small gift or something else. Any ideas on what would be good?

 I'm hoping someone can help me. I work in the education sector as a Network Admin and I'm looking to clear down user profiles en-masse using PDQ Deploy and Powershell but I'm running into a few problems.
 We have over 1000 students here all with roaming profiles and 400~ PCs, we are looking at getting rid of roaming at some stage but that's by the by.
 So, I tried the following scripts in Powershell:
 Get-ChildItem -path "C:\Users\*" -Exclude Default, Administrator | Remove-Item -Recurse -verbose 
 And simply:
 Remove-Item 'C:\Users\*' -Exclude Default, Administrator -Force -Recurse 
 The problem is, I'm getting an Unauthorized Access error. This happens despite running the script with elevated privileges, even locally.
 It has deleted the empty files and subfolders in each account, but leaving files like NTUSER.Dat and 'My Documents'.
 Would I need to run a script to take ownership/give modify access to all these folders beforehand? Or is there a better method for doing this?
 Thanks in advance.

 This is something I am looking for:
  
IPAM can do multi-tenancy something like a tenant can login and can only view and edit their own IP block
 Can record circuits, etc
 Can record VMs, Containers, bare-metal servers
 Has a capability of documenting racks in the datacenter
 VLANs, VxLAN and VRF information
 Can detect overlapping IP or subnets
  
I have never used infoblox and can't really say much about it. At to this point, I need to provide my top 3 products that can be purchased so that it is suitable for enterprise environment. 
 Can you share the paid product you use and can it do a simple DCIM ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need your consultation.
 Let me briefly explain the topic I am working on:
 I work on the topic "satellite integrated terrestrial system" and am trying to understand what dynamic functional split and placement of RAN functions.
 I am a newbie and have never been working on these topics. Reading publications and attempting parallel to understand the basic concepts of the functional split, network slicing, and RAN are inefficient for me. I can spend 3-4 hours or more on one 4 pages-paper.
 Could you please help me with understanding the following questions:
  
What is a dynamic functional split? Does it mean that the placement of central(CU), distributed (DU) and radio units (RU) can be changed during transmission?
  
"dynamic" - process or system characterized by constant change, activity, or progress.
  
I have found a lot of publications where Open-Ran is proposed as a promising technology for satellite-integrated terrestrial networks. For a next-generation wireless system, we expect a huge amount of data and such an integrated system can help with overload. Why does Cloud Ran (CRAN) not suitable then?
  
CRAN can support up to hundreds of gigabit data rates cost-effectively without degrading the performance.

 We just had a site survey done and the results show that we need to roughly double the amount of APs that are currently in use if we wanted to use VoWIFI.
 That brought up some questions:
 1. What is your experience with VoWIFI?
 2. What is your experience with VOIP Apps on smartphones in daily use?
 2. In what cases would you use VoWIFI and in wich DECT?

As the mailbox probably is fairly old, it would be helpful if it was possible to only measure the last X months, otherwise time of employment would impact the stats. 
 I'm waiting to get a MS o365 admin account, but the people that create them are a tad bit slow. I hope I posted this question in the right sub. I'm a bit new to all this, having done a drastic career change into IT admin in my mid 30s due to an injury.

 Single Domain, 25 users. Folder Redirection and Roaming Profiles. 
 The server was originally at the start, a 2003 SBS server and over the years has been migrated to new hardware with whatever version of Windows was current at the time. The intention is to put Server 2022 on the new Hardware. It's currently on 2012R2
 Given how many upgrades it's had, we are wondering about whether it would be better to create a new domain from scratch vs trying to do yet another upgrade. There seems to be legacy GPO's going back many many many years and we are a little worried that there is stuff in the system now that could be problematic. 
 Before anyone asks, yes they require an on-prem server for another cycle as their LOB application doesn't have a cloud equivalent for another 2 years at least. 
 One of the main issues is moving the profiles up and setting them up on the new domain etc.
 ​
 Interested in your thoughts on that.

We are slowly migrating client systems to Azure AD joined devices. There are a small handful of on-premise application/file servers remaining in the environment.
 With password hash sync, Users with expired passwords are allowed to access cloud resources normally. However, the rub begins where said user with Azure AD Joined system attempts to access an on-premise resource, which prompts for credentials (Because the password is expired). Simply wondering what the general guidance is to keep passwords synced back to on-premise AD for users logging into Azure AD Join systems. The on-premise AD Password policy matches the Azure Password policy.
 I was thinking about setting "EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers" from this article https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronizatio. Per this setting, the password would need to be changed on-prem first to initiate the enforcement process.

They’ll be keeping the ISP hand off in the same data room and will have a large fiber run from the left half to the right. Nothing on the left half of the building will be connected to their network. 
 What’s best practice? Putting the firewall on the ISP side or on the client side of the fiber run? 
 Note: They use unmanaged converters now but I suggested using switching with SPF so we can manage it better and see connection quality, etc.

 Anyone moved away from those products to others and have some experiences to share? (if you knew back then what you know now, post migration, would you have chosen another option etc?)

 There are servers piled high with really resource intensive software. Some on the domain, some not. Nothing central. Easy to resolve. Basic stuff. But noone will hear me or they want to address 1000 things at once.
 There are these two dev servers just piled high. SQL, IIS, Visual Studio, and a huge swath of dev software. And they have developersiterally remoting in and working directly on the servers. Running massive processes in VS.
 I have told the CTO until Im blue in the face... Throwing more resources at these wint solve the issue. Well just keep adding resources. We need to split up some of it. SQL at the least.
 And he just isn't hearing my actual point. Saying things like, it's a lower env we can have sql and iis on one server. That's not my point....
 I got a request this morning and there are two ways to do it. One takes 15 steps, the other way takes 2. The easy way is modifying the config. I wasn't 100% sure which setting it was so... I sent an email asking, "Which setting in the configuration is x?" 
 This guy responds, "Yes, you can do it in the config." It's like no matter how I word it - he doesn't take my goddammit point and I'm about to put my foot through a window.
 Like I make this very well and clear point and he says, "Thanks for your inputs but its okay to have x y and z on a single server in a lower env.
 That was never my point. My point was - these vms are going to eat up every fucking thing you give them and well end up in a never ending loop of adding resources and you'll never remember that I said it would happen. Instead you'll just ask me, why does this keep happening? Like it's my fault.....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I never really thought I'd be making a post like this but that's only because I was too busy being an atta boy and not paying attention to the writing on the wall. 
 I'm a system admin over a very specific set of applications and systems. I've expressed my want to move outside of this role, however those conversations have been fruitless for the most part. I got an opportunity at another company for System Admin in a more traditional IT role. I spoke with my bosses today after telling them about the opportunity and I got the "what can we do to keep you" speech. 
 I feel like my biggest hurdle is my current boss. He knows half as much as I do, does 1/4 of the tickets I do, and delegates every.single.chance he gets. He's not a managing Sr, he's supposed to be a working Sr admin, which has been made abundantly clear to him via our chain several times, yet still there's next to no production from his office. I can't get a raise because then I'll make more than he does, and I can't get promoted because he doesn't have any place that'll take him, he has a bad work history within our department and is frankly lucky to even have a job at this point. 
 My question is...do I keep sticking around and trudging forward in the hopes that eventually the ice will break and I'll get a chance to move? Or do I just pick up my toys and go play someplace else where I can gain traditional IT experience that will go towards my resume if I choose to move again later on? I've been at my current company for 16 years, which makes it harder to just pack up and go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
 I am looking for help/suggestions on a cisco design topology. I have a project where I'm moving data between sites that are geographically distant. I want redundancy within this system that will be using cellular as its backbone.
 I have visited the locations and completed cellular audits of the signal, bandwidth, etc. Were happy with the speeds and it appears for the most part connectivity shouldn't be an issue. But we cannot have tons of reliability issues. So redundancy is important.
 I have IR1101 cellular routers at my disposal. I have attached a drawing to show this topology.
 My questions is:
 How do I steer traffic to use one cellular connection as primary and when this connection fails use the other cellular connection? Policy based routing? if so, can you expand on how this actually works and maybe link something I can gather more information on the config its self. I am a working Network engineer but I have not done this specific config before. Funny enough, cisco makes this 100x harder than all other manufactures. Also costs 4x. But I have the routers so that's what were running with.
 Key Notes:
 Cellular SIMs are Private static routable IPS. These are not accessible from anywhere outside of this Private subnet provided by carriers. Meaning The VZW sims can talk to one another, and the ATTs can. But not between the two carriers. In addition these SIMs cannot reach the internet. Internet cannot reach them. (this is a paid service from the providers)
 I am starting with simple site-to-site VPN tunnels. redundant setup. Tunnel 1 between VZW sims. Tunnel 2 ATT SIMs.
 With this setup, I figure all I need is to tell the router. "Hey always use VZW Cell interface, if it fails, go out ATT interface." Since both cellular connections are live, and they both have tunnels. The failover is simply switching the interface the traffic is going out.

 ive seen some post about the WiPry 2500x but the device cost 900$ ... might aswell keep an android in my backpack for that price ....
 is it possible to use other adapters like Alfa cards ? ore any other external device i could use for that purpose
 i already have a Netool.io so i can still perform network discovery and pcap etc... i only need a solution to monitor WiFi RSSI and see channels

 https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5020805-how-to-manage-kerberos-protocol-changes-related-to-cve-2022-37967-997e9acc-67c5-48e1-8d0d-190269bf4efb

 We were like many others in that the first update kinda broke things and we put in the entry to fix that issue. Then After the 2nd update we've added the auditing and we do see audit entries related to accounts that won't work after the final updates. 
 We're trying to get way ahead of this so we don't have as many issues by the time all is said and done and honestly we're really lost on how to handle this. We've been wondering if we need to automate the adjustment to all existing AD accounts and computer objects? Is this going to affect anything that makes an LDAP call instead of LDAPS? Are we overthinking it and it's actually not a big deal and it all works itself out through all of the updates? 
 We just don't quite understand everything that's happening related to these updates and we'd rather cause some little bumps to get everything ready early versus one massive downtime issue when Microsoft sends out the last update and enforces the new encryption types.

Problem is when failover occurs. The inside interface is no longer passing internet traffic. I can ping the inside interface from the inside network but now internet traffic is allowed. I have been working with TAC forever and 4500 switch tack blames firewall, firewall tac blames switch. Because of the way the firewall fails over and keeps the same IP address but on the other firewall makes me think there is something with ARP table that is not allowing the IP to change for that MAC address. I am looking for any ideas. We are a manufacturing 24/7 so I can not just reboot the 4500. I have performed forced redundancy failures and it is not specific to which switch is the supervisor.

It's useally the same departments, same users over and over again. It would help if HR told us when a user was no longer employed, but that is asking way to much I guess.

 ​
 After a long journey, I was able to regain control of six /24 IP blocks that my organization purchased back in 1992. I then put a few of these IP blocks to use, but have ran into a snag. Apparently, since these blocks have never been used on the outside internet, they were listed on the SPAMHAUS PBL. 
 The only information SPAMHAUS lists is the following:
  
Removal procedure 
 Removal of IP addresses within this range from the PBL is not allowed by the netblock owner's policy.
  
The bolded is frustrating as I am functionally the netblock owner, yet I see no option for submitting a removal request anywhere. 
 My idea is to put in a ticket with ARIN and with Lumen(whom is our ISP), but wanted to know if anyone else had any tips or ideas?
 Thanks in advance!

 Timeline:
 Email sent from genuine customer trying to make payment.
 Email returned to customer from a slightly different domain name with alternative bank details. It has correct email signature and some original text that one of my users has written.
 Customer queries with us and we realise what is happening and no payment is made.
 Provider contacted to block domain
 We use O365 and the user accounts have MFA. The password was poor for our user, so it has been changed to a new policy we are rolling out.
 Today it has happened again with a different customer and a different domain name - again very close to ours. They were going to make payment and the received a reply from a different domain but with text that looks like it came from us. One of the users involved is on holiday so I have disabled their login but this time a shared email account was spoofed. This account is disabled in AD by default (we are hybrid).
 Feels like we are being hacked somewhere. We are contacting our cyber insurance and I have requested the second domain be taken down. I have also reported to our email security/archiving company.
 Has anyone been affected this way before? What was the outcome?
 A worried thanks.

 But then I started thinking - after decades of the "older" generation being just. Pretty bad at operating their equipment generally, if the new crop of folks coming in end up being very, very bad at things and also needing constant help, that's going to be very, very depressing. I'm right in the middle as a millennial and do not look forward to kids half my age being like "what is a folder"
 But at least we can all hold hands throughout the generations and agree that we all hate printers until the heat death of the universe.

We recently purchased some laptops and I’ve been tasked to create a golden image and have this installed on all the new laptops. Any recommendations on which software I should use? Or if we were to outsource this to a MSP, what would be an appropriate fee to pay? My background is in unified communications so I’m not 100% when it comes to real hardcore IT stuff.

 Is there a best practice for safely shutting these things down? I’ve got a monitor, keyboard, and mouse plugged into them. 
 Since anything that would be accessing the storage cluster is powered down, am I good to just shut windows down, starting with the second storage server?

 My manager wants to start using some form of MDM at our organisation, we haven't used it in the past as the number of users and devices was negligible, but we're at the point now where we need to start looking at implementing it. He is dead set on using Microsoft Intune/Endpoint Manager to do this. All our identity management is done via Azure AD. We essentially want to:
  
Allow users to log into any device using their Microsoft 365 account
 Deploy applications that the specific user is allowed to use, this should be able to be done on any device
 Push auto-updates, auto shutdown and remotely monitor devices
  
Is Intune/Endpoint Manager the ideal piece of software to do this? Are there any alternatives I could suggest even though my manager is dead set on it, as Intune/Endpoint Manager has so many features that we may not need? Also, are the requirements above feasible on Intune/Endpoint Manager?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In order to increase room on the network for our rapidly growing office (with many lab devices as well), we decided to split the wireless network into a separate VLAN/subnet. That's all well and good but our three printers (HP MFPs) are all Ethernet only. Our original subnet that remains ethernet based is 10.1.26.0 /24 and the new WLAN one is 10.1.29.0 /24. They are connected on the back end via our Cisco layer three switch and talk to each other fine. 
 People, when they're hard-wired, are able to print with no issue as before. However, I noticed that when on the new wireless network, they are having trouble reaching the printers that they have added on the other, hardwired based subnet with the drivers they have (though of course they can ping and access the web interface IPs fine). So far the solution is to remove those old drivers (added through the basic Microsoft 'add a printer' feature), go to the HP website and download/install the full official driver, skip past the step where it scans the network and can't find anything, and then manually input the IP address of the printer on the other subnet of 10.1.26.0. This then seems to work for both the wireless and ethernet subnets. But it is a few extra steps and a bit of work for the users, who sometimes may get confused or don't have time.
 Also, I noticed if you just use the basic Microsoft 'add a printer', 'can't find printer I'm looking for', 'manually enter the printer IP address', it just finds some generic or universal print driver that is not the most descriptive or useful, as it can't seem to find or offer an option for the actual precise driver.
 Anyway my main question is, is there a simpler way to do this, and advertise the printer easily and directly on both networks, or just make the existing printer installs on user machines work on both?
 Thanks.

 Is it safe for me to simple outright delete this file? If not, what does the default file look like so I can adjust it without accidentally breaking something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday someone tried to login to my Synology NAS through SSH. It was a bruteforce attack, so it was permanently blocked after they tried a few times. What worries me is that I really don't know how have they done it. The SSH port that I'm using, which is not even the default (22), is only accesible through LAN and scanning it returns a closed port.
 Let me briefly describe my setup:
  
ISP router in bridge mode.
 Mini-pc running pfSense Community Edition v2.6.0.
 Synology NAS connected to pfSense.
  
​
 Pfsense config
  
upnp disabled.
 A few ports open for some of the NAS services, with the corresponding firewall rules.
  
​
 Synology NAS config
  
SSH is enabled and running on a port which is NOT open in pfsense. It is only accesible through LAN. I've tried accessing it through WAN and I can't.
 SFTP enabled and running on an open port accesible through WAN.
 WebDAV enabled and running on an open port accesible through WAN.
 Torrent client running on a docker container. The TCP port is fixed and upnp is disabled on the client.
  
Was this hacker exploiting a pfsense vulnerability? Or maybe a Synology's vulnerability? Or am I doing something wrong? Surprisingly, neither the SFTP nor the WebDAV had any intrusion.

 We have a class of 32 PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Version1809.
 Recently I've installed some software 'Autodesk Inventor 2023". Since then. on around 2/3 of the PCs the domain accounts take around 10-15 minutes to load up, and when it finally logs in comes up with the error shown in the photo on this page (Except 2023 rather than 2019)
 https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Warning-1909-Could-not-create-Shortcut-Inventor-Electrical-Project-2019-Ink.html
 "Warning 1909. Could not create Shortcut Inventor Electrical Project 2023.Ink" when launching Inventor
 Any ideas what I can try. So far I've tried fresh uninstall and reinstall.
 Tried these instructions
  
Navigate to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk.
 Locate the folder labeled Inventor Electrical Library 2023.
 Right-click and select properties.
 Clear the Read-Only attributes at the bottom of the box and Apply. 
  
Also tried the master folder and subfolder and gave all users full access to read and write and modify where this shortcut is supposed to possibly be.
 I've also turned off Controlled folder access too via Windows Security. Local admin and network admin both log on.
 Not sure what else to try. Only thing I can think of is that the user domain accounts connect to a network drive and they can't access their C:// drives (except admin). But obviously reads all the program data from the C drive.
 I'm baffled why it doesn't happen on every single one though.
 ​
 Any tips for me to try?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

 I noticed a few things with the existing cabling that seemed a bit strange.
  
Most of the cable is loose-laid over the ceiling grid.
 Some cables is zip-tied to threaded rods, that are used for the HVAC ducting (which I assume is somewhat better, right?).
 Several open plastic takeaway containers of liquid - not sure what it is? Maybe leaks?
 Several pieces of old clothing/rags up there - I assume from construction, or somebody left their overalls?
 Exposed electrical wiring
  
Firstly, does anybody know of any photos of a *good* data cabling setup in a suspended ceiling? (So I can show them what it should ideally look like).
 The closest I could find are these - but they don't really show the final complete setup:

 Secondly, what's a way to describe to a non-technical person, why the above are issues? Or why it might cause issues when they try to add new cabling etc?

 The difference with me is that I have a mishmash environment. Two domain controllers - 2003 and 2008. The domain level is set to 2003. From 2003 I can not migrate to 2022 directly. But from 2008 already yes? I can't find anywhere if after demote old DC 2003 and then upgrading the domain to 2008 I will be able to migrate directly to 2022. Only there is information about the R2 version. On File Services I have option to install Distributed File System and DFS Namespaces, DFS Replication.
 The next question is about the ip number of the new domain controller. I would like to leave the old ip number. That way I wouldn't have to change the dns number anywhere.

 ​
 I need to upgrade a cluster from vSphere 6.7 to 7.0. The VCSA is already on 7.0. HA is currently activated.
 ​
 What is the best order for the upgrade? Would you attach the new ISO baseline to one host, then to the next one, etc. or to the cluster and remediate one after the other?
 ​
 Would you fully disable HA, or only do maintenance of single hosts?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We have had a long running issue regarding Sophos XG Firewall. Users who log in to their laptops have access to the internet, and then when some lock their computers and come back to it, the heartbeats aren't sent to the firewall and they're blocked from accessing the internet until they restart the laptop.
 We have a 3rd party who provide the equipment for us and "manages" them, and we've been on at them for 18 months about this issue. Their response tends to be to run a piece of software that pulls the logs from the machine which is then sent to Sophos. We've done this for so long with no real solution to the issue. I get the feeling the issue is with Sophos as they don't know (or care) why this is happening, so things are just stuck.
 I've been asked by my boss to find an alternative to Sophos XG Firewall, as a number of users are losing chunks of the day from having to restart their computers to get back on to the internet. The firewall must be user aware, so that we can apply specific rules to these users. 
 Can anyone suggest an alternative? One with good support would be advantageous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First let me preface this with I have very limited networking experience, but I am at my wits end with a recurring issue that feels like no one else wants to figure out so I'll learn how to. hopefully. 
 With this out the way, periodically (always during core business hours) we have really bad network performance, dropping packets from site to external, from site to data centre. But performance inside the data centre to internal devices is fine which leads me to believe that something on site is doing something to an external entity. 
 To give you some idea, we have site connected to a data centre via fibre and then from that data centre firewall out to the internet. 
 I don't even know really where to begin with this, the only evidence of the issue is poor network performance, packets being dropped to servers in the DC and to the internet. Im hoping to be able to at least figure out where the traffic is being sent to and or from and from ether i can then figure out what and why and ultimately how to deal with this. 
 I apologise if this is not the kind of post you folks accept here.
 Thanks for reading

 Juniper SRX -- Modem -- Internet
 The issue am having is am not able to ping from the FW (Edge device) to the Internet nor to the modem IP address.
 I have read through what so called IP passthrough and tried several setups with no luck.
 The modem type is : BGW320-505

 We're experiencing an issue with some of the bigger call queue's we have. We use Ringcentral integrated with Teams.

 When there is a member of the call queue out of office the other users will get an incoming call double (because of the Teams forward I think?). But when 2 users pick up at the same time, the caller is lost.
 Any one has an idea what's going wrong here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am aware that a network professional should plan a site and choose appliances and brands depending on several factors, such as:
  
Reputation and Reliability: A brand with a good reputation for quality and reliability is likely to be preferred by a network engineer. This is because they need to ensure that the network is up and running smoothly at all times, and any downtime or failure could result in significant losses for the organization.
 Compatibility and Integration: A network engineer may choose a brand that integrates well with other devices already in use in the network. This can simplify network management and reduce the likelihood of compatibility issues.
 Features and Functionality: Different brands offer different features and functionality, and a network engineer may choose a brand based on the specific needs of their organization. For example, a brand that offers advanced security features may be preferred for a network that handles sensitive data.
 Cost: The cost of networking devices can vary significantly between brands, and a network engineer may need to balance the cost with the needs of the organization. In some cases, a more expensive brand may be preferred if it offers better performance or reliability, while in other cases, a more affordable brand may be preferred if cost is a primary concern.
  
Having said so, for our next school site (900 users) we could opt to continue using Ubiquiti devices which have an overall good price to performance and reliability ratio. However, within the community, there are several experts who keep on snubbing Ubiquiti as if it were an unreliable or less-enterprise grade devices.
 Given the the above brands, and the above thoughts, if you were asked "Ubiquiti, why yes and why no", how would you reply? What is Ubiquiti missing compared to the other two brands, apart from a poor support, which is essentially community based?

 What does everyone use for their "what's your computer name script"

 Looking for something easy. EG they double click on it, pops up a html page with the info. EG Computername, IP address etc
 ​
 Before we would stick a sticker and choose the name in SCCM during the build.
 But now with Intune and Autopilot you can't do it and we can't be bothered changing it in Intune as we would have to login to the computer etc. and that's annoying and broke Azure AD once on the machine. I don't mind if they are random but want to be able to get the name easy for the end user so we can connect using Spalshtop.

 Unfortunately they are not. Is there something i'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says. I am trying to build a route-based VPN between an ASA and a NSX-V. If this might be better suited for r/cisco then feel free to let me know. The ASA 5515 is current NAT'd behind another firewall. Ports 4500, 500, and 50 are DNAT'd to the ASA. This is where my knowledge of networking starts to fizzle out as I believe a lot of the issues I am running into are because of NAT-T and potential limitations I might not know of or how to get around
 The NSX-V is connected directly with a public IP. I am connecting the on-site ASA to the cloud hosts NSX-V. In the snippets below the 216. is the NSX-V and the 10. is the ASA. All Phase 1 settings match and what is interesting is that if make a change to the tunnel on the NSX-V and save (like disabling and re-enabling PFS) the tunnel acts like it comes up on port 500.
  6 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 302015 10.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 216.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 Built outbound UDP connection 9147 for Outbound:216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) to identity:10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) 
 However after about ~30s I get this error and the tunnel continues to loop on port 4500
 4 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 750003 Local:10.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Remote:216.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Username:216.xxx.xxx.xxx IKEv2 Negotiation aborted due to ERROR: Auth exchange failed 
 I saw in this VMware article that states potential issues with NSX-T and IPsec with NAT-T. So I would assume that same behavior is to be expected with NSX-V. I configured the NSX-V to only be a IKE Responder so that only the ASA would initiate the tunnel but I havent seen any change in outcome. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77288
 As a test I tried to build a policy-based IPsec tunnel to a USG I get somewhat similar behavior where Phase 1 completed however after that the tunnel is torn down and the reason being User-Requested. 
 Just a little stumped, if anyone wants to toss some knowledge into my beggars cup. It would be much appreciated :)

 I currently have a PowerShell Script that can perform this task but can only do 1-1. I also tried making a script(using google) that can perform this task but for bulk using a csv but I have not succeeded yet.

 I've been studying Spine-Leaf/Clos networking design for cloud native data centers for quite some time. Now is time to put the hands onto work !
 Where I live (Brasil), we do have few options when it comes to good equipments and fair prices. Mainly white box ones, being QuantaMesh and Arista the closest (EdgeCore models available are not ONIE compatible, so ...).
 So, for our case, based on price capabilities, we have the following models to be purchased :
  
Arista 7050QX-32
 QuantaMesh T1048-LB9A
 Nexus 2048T
 Nexus 3000 (3048TP) and 5000 (5596T)
  
The preference is for white box switches, and only Arista fits that requirement (we're evaluating SONiC and Stratum primarily). QuantaMesh has models that does, but 10048-LB9A seems to not be compliant and doesn't support ONIE.

 Have a public website with domain, currently using two nameservers at the registrar.
 Those NS's are hosted by the same company, and if that company has an outage, none of my (A), (CNAME), (TXT) or (SRV) records are going to resolve.
 My thought is to setup a Hurricane Electric free DNS account at and add just two of their name servers as the third and fourth entry:
 ns1.he.net
 ns2.he.net
 T so if a lookup is made for any of the records during an outage of the first two NS, it will (FAIL), (FAIL), (RESOLVE he.net DNS).
 Now I don't mind keeping the two DNS server entries up to date manually, there are like 10-15 records in total. But does anyone see any issue doing this that I am not thinking about?

 We finally configured DMARC for our domain about a week ago. Everything was functioning fine, reports were coming in correctly, and then we decided to change the email we were receiving reports at to better filter them. Since then, emails to some domains (not all) are bouncing with "554 5.7.5 Permanent error evaluating DMARC policy". 
 All our records are checking correctly with spf/dkim/dmarc checkers, and all the records have propagated out correctly.
 DNS host says check with your email provider (Google), Google says "your records look fine, turn off DMARC or reach out to every domain you're getting that error from and ask their IT to add you to a whitelist"
 Is that the answer? Are we doing DMARC wrong? Our current record is just "v=DMARC1;p=none;rua=mailto:dmarc@ourdomain.com", still getting bounces.

 To this point the Network Administrator has had the responsibility of purchasing and managing the SSL certificates on the Internet domain registrar. No issue there.
 Previously, the Network Administrator stood up the base server, and the WebDev installed the Internet Web service. The Network Admin would download the appropriate Cert and private key and make it available to WebDev
 New people have come onboard as WebDev, and they seem to have the attitude that it is the Network Administrator's job to maintain the certs on the various servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a reorganization of a relatively small data center into something resembling a decently designed, modular network. It's of a size where it doesn't need anything more than a collapsed core with ToR switches acting as a access. It's going to be L2 access for now because of equipment availability. Also because of its small size, I'm not doing any overlay networking.
 However, some of the hosts are VMhosts like ESXi and it occurs to me that they have their, virtual switches internally. Other than providing basic VLAN infrastructure, they aren't doing anything in terms of service provisioning, port density is a nonsensical concept for a vSwitch, and any interconnect to physical switches is, at most, going to be doing basic trunking/tagging.
 So, how do these fit into the outline of the infrastructure? I'm trying to get this design to be scalable -- small right, but possible to grow and evolve without major rip and replace of the whole thing rather than piece by piece over the years -- and data center networking is something I'm not deeply familiar with. Do you just ignore their presence, beyond ensuring there is no possibility of them causing L2 issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I purchased an older switch off of ebay in order to upgrade my internet network at my home. I know enough to be dangerous, but I'm running into issues setting this up in my home network. 
 For my main controller, I'm running an Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro at 192.168.1.1. I have a few other subnets off of that, but this one for this switch is 192.168.4.0/24.
 I set the ip address of the switch as 192.168.4.2 255.255.255.0
 I set the default router of the switch to 192.168.4.1
 I then setup the dhcp-server pool...
 ip dhcp-server enable ip dhcp-server pool home network 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 excluded address 192.168.4.1 192.168.4.10 excluded address 192.168.4.100 192.168.4.254 dhcp-default-router 192.168.4.2 dns-server 192.168.1.1 lease 1 0 0 deploy 
 After setting this, I can run `show ip dhcp-server address-pools` and it shows me the correct configuration and that I have one active lease for the dhcp server pool, but for whatever reason either i'm missing something from here or i've done something wrong that just above my scope of knowledge. Either way, i'm looking for help. 
 Anything you can contribute I would greatly appreciate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2020 lockdowns we got fairly settled with a remote working configuration that involves our remote team using RDP on a thin client of sorts, remotely controlling a remote Windows 11 Pro workstation (via a VPN). We then either use a work smartphone for VOIP calls, or using remote audio redirection via RDP. Remote audio redirection works OK if latency is low (under 30ms), but we now have someone who has over 150ms ping to their remote workstation. Unfortunately this causes VOIP calls to have a LOT of lag (probably about 1000ms latency or more) and is generally not great. Before I send out another smartphone, I wanted to do a little bit of digging to see if there are better remote audio solutions available.
 When doing some research I found that some people were experimenting with to passing through a USB audio device, but I can't seem to find a way to do this on a Windows 11 Pro workstation - I enabled the group policy option for RemoteFX USB passthrough on my client PC but I still can't seem to find this as an option.
 Other people have suggested installing VOIP software on the local machine - but having to flip flop between the local and remote environment sounds really annoying.
 The last thing I've discovered is a tool called sound-over-rdp, but I can't seem to find any feedback as to whether it's a good tool or not. It also is a little bit on the expensive side of things, would rather not drop nearly $3k AUD for 5 users / servers.
 I did also find an open source project called USBIP-Win that allows for USB redirection, but it seems pretty complex. I had a quick look at their github and I'm not quite sure it'd solve my issue to be honest.
 Any suggestions on the best practices from here would be greatly appreciated!

 My questions are :
 ​
 1- Adding page files to other disks may increase performance up to the maximum ?

 2- if I put the Windows Page File (Pagefile.sys) on the same disk where database or log files are located. is it correct ?

 I have 1 email address linked to a custom domain. The domain is hosted on name.com, and the email is hosted via Microsoft365
 I'm able to send and receive mail from within my outlook client just fine.
 I followed the "Enabling DKIM" guide from learn.microsoft on the following link:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dkim-configure?view=o365-worldwide
 Additionally, I also followed the github guide on https://github.com/duocircle/Office365-Setup-DKIM-DMARC-SPF
 By following the guides, I added 2 DNS records for my custom domain, and waited 24h to verify this in the dashboard. After 24h the verification succeeded, and the tool at https://security.microsoft.com/dkimv2 reported that DKIM was set up successfully. 
 However, 48h later, messages received from this email address still report 
 dkim=fail (no key for signature) 
 In the header.
 SPF and ARC are both reported as pass.
 I tried to verify the DKIM records via an external tool (https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=dkim), which reports:
  No DKIM Record found 
 Could it be that I need to publish another TXT record with the shape?
 v=DKIM1; p=76E629F05F70 9EF665853333 EEC3F5ADE69A 2362BECE4065 8267AB2FC3CB 6CBE 
 And if so, does anyone know where to get this kind of information?
 I'm out of ideas on what to try, to make the DKIM check succeed.

 I’ve got this odd issue the with the VMware sdwan / Velocloud Edge 510-LTE. I have about 150 and randomly they drop their LTE interface. It’s just not there. The debug thinks so too. A reboot doesn’t fix, firmware upgrade doesn’t fix. I have to pull the power for a bit and reconnect to resolve. Across my fleet I’ve got usually about 5 with this issue. The SP can’t work it out and VMware’s reply is it’s not a priority so they get to it one day.
 Curious if anyone seen this ? I though initially heat related but I’ve demonstrated it’s isn’t. 
 Cheers

 Example: I rename Ben Dover to June Doe.
 When the user logins in to their existing Windows device (AzureAD joined) with their new email address (ben.dover@domayn.co), the first thing Windows does is show a their old name (Ben Dover). Then if they click on the Start button, their profle icon (for Sign Out, Lock etc), shows their old name too.
 Even if you rename their user profile folder and the relevant registry key (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/user-profiles-and-logon/renaming-user-account-not-change-profile-path) the same symtons exist. 
 Anyone else experiencing this and know a way to resolve it?

We haven't had enough time yet to make any of this work properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had an old windows 2012 physical production server failed a few weeks ago. We had DB and file backups for that server. So, we ended up rebuilding the server from the backups. But it still caused a lot of impact, like almost 2 days of production down, and missing a few days of data. 
 After that incident, the boss ordered us to convert all physical servers to Virtual server. We still have a handful of old physical 2012 mission critical running. We use hyper-v for our VMs. Converting is easy, but expecting doing it on the weekend to minimize business downtime. We don't have a lifecycle for servers, if they are not EOl and still running, we just let them run.
 Most of those physical servers are old ,I think a better approach is creating new server and letting the application owner migrate the data out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 laptop (Win11 Home) that recently had its motherboard replaced through repair. There was no option for me to suspend Bitlocker as the Windows I have doesn't feature that and my laptop stopped working, so I didn't prepare for that situation.
 Right now, every time I boot my computer, I am asked to input my Bitlocker recovery key, which is an inconvenience (I have the key backed up). I haven't been able to find solutions that match with this situation as most posts online focus on non-repair related issues.
 The Lenovo technician told me this: It's because the serial number on the motherboard doesn't match with the rest of the laptop. He suggested me that I should reinstall Windows 11, but because it was active when I booted post-repair, I don't think this would work.
 I also found out that there's a BIOS update, along with some other Windows updates that were there for the three weeks I didn't have access to the laptop. But given that the situation I'm in with the Bitlocker Recovery Key is due to a repair and not a software issue, how should I go about this?
 Thank you in advanced for advice! :)

 ​
 If you are using an account that is a part of the Protected users group in AD, that account will not work. You will receive an error stating that vSphere cannot contact the LDAP server along with an invalid credentials error. I assure you, there is no connection issue. This is likely the issue. I would suggest creating a separate account and make sure that it is not a part of the Protected users group. This should fix the issue and allow you to connect through LDAP.

Most of the time when I log in to my win10 work pc the screen does this flashing thing as if it was trying to catch up or refresh. I can get around the system while it’s doing this but it’s super slow. It will do this for about a minute each time. Say I walk away and the surface goes to sleep it does the same thing after waking back up and reestablishing the connection. I have a shit ton of stuff up on my desktop so I figured that has something to do with it. If I reboot the work pc it won’t do it for a bit but that’s super annoying with all the stuff I have open. 
 Here’s the weird part - today I was trying on my girlfriends MacBook and the connection was flawless. Soon as I connected it doesn’t even flash once and I can move around the system within seconds. 
 Any ideas?

MX-01 has an Extended-Vlan-bridge to another MX-02 that has Vlan-vpls encapsulation with the interfaces directly associated to the VPLS routing instance. Which then this VPLS Instance extends the VLANs to the remote sites. MX-02 is a iBGP RR with dynamic tunnels to 10 other sites to create a full mesh. The issue that seems to be happening is the BD is re advertising learned MACs from the remote VPLS sites as its own. Indicating the wrong LSI reachability. And also randomly creating loops with the MAC addresses.
 Is this just the nature of the beast in this setup? Or is there a way to prevent VPLS from readvertising learned mac's across the LSI's? Or would EVPN be a better fit?

Some time ago I tried to deploy same design to other site that has several times higher MAC/IP count, specifically around 5k MACs and 30k IPs across many vlans. First problem I ran into, was per-interface MAC and MAC+IP limit in bridge-domains. I figured out how to increase those limits and decided to try again. To better describe what the config looks like, at the bottom of the text there is example of config. The configuration of second router is similar. I did not include BGP with family evpn but EVPN signaling works fine, I checked that by elected designated-forwarder on both routers.

It's crazy being in this community and seeing the salaries of our American counterparts and here in the UK, the pay for IT jobs seem to be getting stomped down regularly for some reason. "Urgently needed" as well, what a joke!

 I have been working as an sysadmin for 6-7 years and have always been dumbfounded that we have 4-5 WSUS servers, one for each of our customers VM environments that we host. I was told when I started that this was best practice when it was setup but seems like a big fat lie.
 My questions is as follows:
 1) Is it even possible to have 1 WSUS for all the servers for a more seamless environment or is it really best practice how it's setup today. Seems like allot of wasted space.
 2) Would the WSUS server need to be on a domain?
 3) Does anyone have any tips what to do?
 Thanks in advance! 👍

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is more a topic of curiosity than just hating on the cloud. I myself and very wary of the majority of computing being consolidated to a handful of major cloud providers. I know we here are not going to change the world as decision makers greater than us are driving this change.
 What am I curious is if any company of substantial size reversed their cloud journey. Move thing back to a data center when smart like VMs infrastructure. If so, what drove that reason? 
 My biggest gripe about cloud is the constant flux of change. It is almost impossible to mature what we are doing when the tech evolves rapidly every two years now. Half of Azure features always have a “Preview” tag on it. For me, the lack of stability would be my reason to not become a cloud first company. Not ignore it, but not see it as the answer to all my problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've got myself stuck trying to work out how much of our 1Gbps uplinks between switches are being utilised. Our monitoring pulls back input bandwidth and output bandwidth, and our uplinks are fibre with 1Gb SFPs.
 So if the output bandwidth is 100Mbps and the input bandwidth is 100Mbps, then the total bandwidth would be 200Mbps. But because it's a fibre pair how does one affect the other? Is there 1Gbps up and down simultaneously or is the bandwidth limited by the SFP?
 Any pointers gratefully received.

I like to have those images as a wallpaper as a slide show. So every four hours or so the image changes. 
 My buddy said that's a security risk. I am aware of the practice of hiding data inside of images...but if I really wanted to do that I could probably find a way to do that. 
 Personally, I've found those background images to help me especially when your having a bad day. 
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Sysadmin,
 So I’ve got a upcoming task at work this week. I need to replace 3 x old APC UPS Units with 3 x new APC UPS Units. I’ve never done something like this before, but it can’t be that difficult, right?
 I’m planning to do this out of hours. I’m thinking, first of all, shut all infrastructure down properly - this includes: 
 Sophos Firewall, User/Server Switches, Physical Servers, Physical Workstations, QNAP NAS Devices, ESXi hosts, Equallogic SANs. 
 Then, power off the current UPS units and unmount them one by one from racks. Remove one old and replace with one new. Connect all power cables as they were before, and power up the UPS’s. 
 Then just a case of confirming everything is back online and working as expected.
 Am I missing something? Anything important to keep in mind with this sort of task?
 I’m excited because these new UPS’s we’ve bought have NICs, so we can setup monitoring/alerts and check on them (if needed) remotely.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ran the ForensIT profile migration wizard which migrates an existing profile to a new environment (from domain to workgroup, or vice versa). Doing so deletes encryption keys from Chrome's "Local State" file, similar to changing a password, and Chrome lost the saved passwords. When the user logs in from the migrated profile, Local State's encryption key is replaced, so tools like Chromepass don't work, as it tries to use the new Local State encryption key. They didn't login to Google to backup.
 I know the password from the old environment\profile, but switching the profile back still assigns a different SID. Am I screwed without the Local State file? Is there at least a way to find the encryption key? I can then add that to the Local State file and then use the user's password to decrypt it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple years ago, the company I was working for was acquired by a much larger corporation. They never said my job was safe, but the people I was working with reassured me my job was going to be safe. Long story short, after a year, I completed a ton of migration work (pretty much everything) but immediately after I was sent on my way. (I don't hold a grudge against them, I get it, they had teams to do what I was doing by myself.) I did all the sysadmin work and the netadmin work. We would hit up a trusted MSP if I didn't know what to do with the networking side of things. 
 Before the acquisition I was doing everything outside of ERP work. I've been in the sysadmin role for over a decade. Anything Windows that you throw at me I'm fine with... Some linux i'm ok with. I'm pretty good with configuring network equipment, not super advanced. But I'm comfortable with configuring switches and firewalls. Not an expert, but I can work my way around it. 
 When recruiters hit me up, about 75% of them want some intro level NOC role. Others are trying for a senior networking role. I don't think I'm ready for a senior networking role right now, but I think I could be ready within a couple months if given the opportunity. 
 Sorry, I'm kinda rambling because I've had a few beers and I don't know what to do.
 I've had multiple interviews. I've made it known what I'm looking for compensation wise. So I don't know if I'm outpricing myself. But I've never even been lowballed with an offer. 
 I've gotten interviews but not for every job I've applied for, so maybe my resume is garbage? I just don't know what to do.

Now the question is, can I use one port on the NIC as Hyper V’s WAN and the second as a LAN for the internal network that would then be handled by Untangle, or should I just create a scope within Win Server to issue IP’s Via DHCP on the NIC’s second port, or is any of this even possible because I have never attempted it myself. I understand it’s an odd request and it’s more for a Proof of Concept rather than production, but I’m trying to prove a point to a manager that took one network class and now believes themselves and expert. 
 I’m in essence trying to create a network on this blade while getting a DHCP assigned address from the actual production network at work. Running that traffic through untangle to a layer 3 switch/router then out to two Layer 2 switches that will then assign addresses to plugged in devices. It’s a mess admittedly but again this is a proof of concept. 
 I thank anyone who has advice or comments in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to what I know, lower metrics are preferred, but in this case, we have two vEdges routers (MPLS and Internet routers) that are both advertising default routing by using the command "default-info originate," in OSPF.
 The current problem is that the client claims that there are subnet traversing to MPLS routers, which are meant to traverse through the Internet to reach public servers. Upon checking the configuration. The MPLS metric is set to 50 and the Internet to 1, respectively. Internet should be preferred based on the metric they have. Another thing, there is only one point-to-point connection between each router and the core switch, I am unable to access or control those core switches. (refer to the diagram w/ issue)
 https://ibb.co/hRsGv29
 I've now tried setting the MPLS value to 1 and the Inet value to 50, and apparently they claim it works. Do you believe that this is possible, particularly in multi-homed connections? (refer to the diagram FIXED)

That is, software x comes as a product but underneath the hood, it's all driven by an Apache backend. Are you handling updates to Apache outside of the vendor or are you having to lean on the vendor to supply an entire new package with inevitably already out of date versions of these packages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got hired in as a System Administrator role in an $100 million revenue Automotive company about 6 months ago... this job is so stressful, and I feel so under qualified. I worked as a mom and pop hardware shop PC repair technician before coming here and was very forthcoming with my skills, knowledge, etc when I interviewed for this role and they hired me.
 It felt like a lucky break and I was so excited to work in a real professional and corporate environment under an IT professional that has been in the biz for almost 30 years. 
 This was not what happened.
 My RM set me down and introduced me to a Team I'd be working with for support that i needed and they are based in India so I could come to them with any help I need. 3 weeks later, my RM leaves to UAE as well for an indefinite amount of time. Before he leaves, he gives me the most barebones training ive ever received and basically just told me to watch and learn and ill pick up everything i need that way. Every time I need access to something or to help someone out, I have to reach out to someone on my Team in India to grant access, monitor bandwidth, configure DNS, you name it, I pretty much have to ask someone to assist me because either I don't have the tools, or the understanding. Maybe it's a good thing as I don't know exactly what to do with the tools in the first place.
 Is this normal to be hired in like this and feel totally out of place and just constantly questioning if I'm doing a good job? Are there any tips anyone could give me or maybe empathize a bit?
 Any support is appreciated, 
 Much thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're starting the process of transitioning from 5508 WLCs to 9800-L-F WLCs. Our existing 5508s have around 100 APs (all 2700 and 2800 series) connected. I have the new WLCs set up in the same vlan and the plan is to eventually join the two WLC pairs in a mobility group to ease the transfer and eventually install all new 9115 APs but that's not what I'm asking about today.
 I have the 9800s configured and I have one spare 2702 AP that I'm trying to get connected to it.
 5508 IP is: 10.1.50.135 (/25)
 9800 IP is: 10.1.50.132 (/25)
 I set up an isolated DHCP server with option 43 set to the IP of the 9800s and made sure the test AP would reach out to this DHCP server for an address. This part is working. The problem is even after a full wipe (format flash:) and reload from scratch, and after seeing a console message that it properly receives the .132 address from the DHCP server, it then reaches out to .135 anyway and I have no idea why.
 Here's some selected console output to show what I mean:
 %DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface BVI1 assigned DHCP address 10.1.50.232, mask 255.255.255.128, hostname AP0081.c4fc.d39c %CAPWAP-5-DHCP_OPTION_43: Controller address 10.1.50.132 obtained through DHCP AP has SHA2 MIC certificate - Using SHA2 MIC certificate for DTLS. %CAPWAP-5-DTLSREQSEND: DTLS connection request sent peer_ip: 10.1.50.135 peer_port: 5246 
 This is after a full wipe and reload so I don't think there can be any leftover config pointing the AP to .135

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft licensing is obviously confusing as hell and our VAR reps do not seem to have the answers to this question. We do not use O365 (we are on GSuite) but we do want to get Intune working to manage Windows devices. Our main requirements are to get Autopilot working so that we can just mail new users laptops without having to image, use Intune to manage endpoint policies, and use Intune to manage updates (especially feature updates) for older versions of Windows 10.
 When I researched this previously the "EMS E3 (Enterprise Mobility + Security E3" license was supposedly the best option to get all of this. Our VAR seems to think, however, that this does NOT include Autopilot or the ability to push feature updates. Does anyone know if it does or does not? We would likely not use the security features (currently on Crowdstrike) unless it integrates well with our other security products. We are a non-profit so we are hoping we qualify for the non-profit licensing discount but our VAR also thinks that we may not (no idea why they think this). 
 We were also recommended to use this 3rd party site which also makes it seem like EMS E3 does not include Autopilot. However other people have told me that it does and that this site is incorrect. 
 https://m365maps.com/files/Microsoft-365-Enterprise-Landscape.htm
 edit: This link makes it sound like EMS E3 MIGHT be all we need? But it is not quite clear:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/licensing-requirements
 TLDR: What is the cheapest licensing option to get us Intune + Autopilot + Windows Feature Updates patching ?

 I want to setup the SNMP service on the network so that we can leverage the native SNMP capabilities in Domotz. I want to get any/all SNMP alerts transmitted via the Domotz client to a distribution group.
 BTW - this network has NEVER seen SNMP. So it's a brand new installation.
 But something doesn't feel right. I think I'm missing a step with configuration? Or security? We're only starting with SNMPv2 at the moment. I have no idea how to setup v3 yet.
 Any ideas here? Any way to confirm its functionality? Most of the papers I've read have been awful.

If you try to establish a connection to (business) OneDrive or SharePoint, it'll just stall out and do nothing, not even apprising you of the issue.
 That is, unless your 365 tenant still has the SharePoint policy which controls legacy access on "Allow," then it works fine. But we don't and don't want to revert that setting just for this.
 Adobe is obviously a major company with the resources to have upgraded their products for this a long time ago--many others already have, including much smaller companies like Foxit. This leads me to wonder if it's purposeful: maybe they want you to use the Adobe Cloud instead of SharePoint.
 There's a sad little UserVoice entry about this with 8 votes currently (I think more reflective of the obscurity of what the problem is, perhaps combined with many tenants still not going to modern yet, than lack of interest):

Do T1 Support for all their staff (worldwide)
 Do sysadmin duties like maintain their inventory/MDM
 Build out on-prem infrastructure and networks
 Deal with office facility issues, like changing light bulbs or calling a plumber. Because that makes sense.
 You are on your own, for the most part.
  
I know you aren't supposed to say compensation expectations in an interview, but when asked, I gave my range. I thought, surely the pay would be massive to compensate with the laundry list they want this person to do. They came back with, "that's pretty high, and a lot more than we envisioned for this role." Cool, hire someone else then, because that's my worth in this position!
 By the way, this is not a small company. I'd consider this a mid-sized global ~300 person company.
 These hybrid roles that mix several departmental duties on one person are getting way out of hand.

Can anyone give me an example of a switch config that might be missing or would be necessary to allow VLAN 110 to pass through?
 ​
 Thanks

No worries there just instructed him to ship the broken laptop back to me once he received the new one I had prepped and shipped to him. Not too difficult
 Well the employee no call no shows his job after the second laptop showed as delivered and his managers are unable to get a hold of him. 
 I instructed finance I believe it to be wise to withhold his final paycheck until we receive our equipment. Sadly finance did not heed this advice maybe due to certain laws I'm unaware of, But we are now out the two devices and my parent company is telling me I need to follow up and get them back
 How do I proceed with something like this? Is local police an option in this context? 
 Thanks for any advice.

 ​
 That makes every azure admin a whale.
 ​
 This is not a post mortem post, instead I want to know how a decent whale organizes his workstation with security in mind, also to endorse/enforce this best practice to his henchmen. 
 ​
 These are the dimensions in that warped space :
  
use multiple VM's and RDP into them / use an RDP manager
 you can have multiple Displays
 
you can use the Workspace feature
 you can use RSAT tools / PS remoting
 per RDP session you can configure whether 1 or 2 displays are involved
 some mice have programmable buttons that help you scroll thru Workspaces
 you can use 65" TV screens if you want, IT is not poor where you work 
  
​
 These are the limitations:
 Must use 2 identities: a personal and an admin identity
 The admin account can not have access to Outlook or internet : vsphere/zabbix/jira .. only 
 The bare metal should be a Jumpstation as per MS best practice
 At least one VM for personal Identity, where Outlook lives and for general/genuine Internet work
 ​
 ​
 Challenges
 Many admin task involve cookbooks .. that are online.
 Workspaces are great until you discover that VM's you RDP into have workspaces as well. Your programmable mouse gets confused/freezes, forcing you to use the keyboard to 'pop' into the right level.
 You have to screenshot an error on a VM, but then waste time to find where your Outlook instance lives to get it sent to the ERP people.
 Running wayland on the bare metal for your three monitors isn't plug and play, nor is getting portreps working in linux
 You want Teams running as a singleton in your setup, but discover another instance has the camera locked. Or fights with Skype for Business for the dial tone.
 Your employer expects you to multi-task, obviously.
 ​
 ​
 How can it be done ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! 
 My team and I are working on a upcoming large/arena scale sized VR experience and some people would like to know what the best or most suggested routers for this setup would be:
  
60'x80' total coverage needed
 6 Meta Quest Pros, all using Wifi/Airlink
 6 individual desktops to power each individual headset
  
The headsets need to be able to talk/communicate to each other but do not need internet access, this is a local multiplayer experience. Wifi signal/coverage is extremely important too for quality to remain at the desired level. These are the general questions suggestions we are hoping someone could shed some light on:
  
What routers do we need to buy?
 And how are we doing the connections for each PC to each headset?
 Won’t each PC to headset connection require multiple routers?
 With each PC to VR headset on a separate connection and router?
 And then these routers cannot cover the whole space, so don’t we need a mesh network or wired connections to each of the routers in the ceiling?
  
Any help or recommendations on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

 I know that we can do it on ise but how long can ise store those logs for? Can it do it for 1 year more than 1 year etc?
 What about prime and which one is the better option for storing logs.
 And when I talk about logs I'm talking about all commands which a user types into the cli on a switch/router etc.
 We are trying to figure out when some vlans were created on our core as these have no description and no svi associated with them. No Mac addresses associated with them either so thinking on whether to delete them or not but need to know who and when they were created and why.
 We use both prime and ise.

 How do I accomplish this without taking down the network with a loop? 
 I've seen documentation on ethernet daisy-chaining but I don't think that fits this use case. 
 I've other posts that hint that you don't need to worry about spanning-tree as each MAP will only use one path back to wired network anyway.

 I'm a one-man shop and I'm supporting an environment with a domain controller on 2012R2. I'm replacing this device as it is EOL in October, I need some help with best practices and ease of transition/migration.
 I'm not planning on performing an in place upgrade, I'm working on getting new hardware and licenses for a fresh install.
 I've read some information about adding the new server / DC to the existing one and then making it the primary and feel like this is the best way to go...however I want to add an additional difficulty into the mix. Currently the domain name is named with a prefix "abc.TLD.com" Since I'm not doing an an in place upgrade I want to fix this and change the domain name to just the TLD. I'm also not sure why this was done in the first place, is there any particular reason to do this that I might not be aware of?
 I want to hear your insights from anyone that has had to go through this on what is the best path to take. I'm primarily concerned with the downtime a new domain will cause as some of the equipment wont know how to find their dependent servers using DNS as well I'm concerned that permissions will be broken and how to best go about moving over OU's and security groups etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I wanted to share the documentation for a project I've been working on in the school district I work at. If you're not familiar with RDS, it basically allows large amounts of users to rdp into a host or hosts that have a shared resource pool, and Guacamole is a browser based RDP server. This will allow us to cut back on computer labs and allow students to use windows based software on their chromebooks. When I set out to make it this way I could not find any clear documentation on how to set this all up and have Azure SAML working so I wrote some up in case anyone else wants to give it a try!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I'm little bit out of options with this one. Please advise. 
 The environment:
 Few Windows and Linux servers on the same network, which itself is firewalled, but no firewalls between servers in the network. One downstream WSUS server that's keeps Windows servers in the network up to date. No domain or DNS.
 Two of the servers are Windows 2019 SE HYPER-V hosts with few VMs. Let's call them HPV01 and HPV02. 
 Apart from the purposes of the VMs and IP addresses, these hosts are identical.
 HPV02 now lost the ability of accessing some shares on the network. There was no change in the configuration. Shares from the server itself are still accessible by others. The error message:
  
Network Error
 Windows cannot access \10.0.0.11
 Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To try to identify and resolve network problems, click Diagnose. 
 Error code: 0x80070035 The network path was not found. 
  
The address is correct, perfectly accessible from all the other servers in the network. Even by the VMs on the affected host. 
 It also lost access to the WSUS share by IP, but it's possible to access this share by WSUS server name, even tho there's no record in the hosts file. (how?)
 I tried all the possible solutions I could find on the internet. Lot of them for example here.
 Thank you for any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to open a port for a host on the other side of a Policy based IPSec tunnel. The reason I want to do this is because most of my sites sit behind a CGNAT and I'm not able to open up ports on those sites firewall. Well if I do it would be pretty useless haha
 The current network setup involves OPNSense in Azure as a hub and the sites connect to is so the can reach each other. They also use OPNSense as their firewall as well. 
 My subnets for each network are the following
 Azure: 10.0.0.0/24
 Site A: 10.1.0.0/24
 Site B: 10.2.0.0/24
 Site C: 10.3.0.0/24
 So basically what I'm trying to figure out is if I have a host on Site A is is possible to open a port on the Azure side of the tunnel and forward the traffic to back to the host on Site A?

 But we are having an unusual problem with it for some time now. It randomly freezes and nothing can get it back except reboot. Keyboard input, network, VMs, GUI, everything is down. If we connect monitor to the server we can see CLI, but unable to interact with it.
 Error that repeats itself in the logs just before the cluster freezes is: kernel BUG at net/8021q/vlan.h:47!
 We did some research and only documented case I can find is from oracle https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Sun%20Microsystems/2903057_1.html. But we dont have an oracle account and can not see the article.
 My question is if anyone had the same issue, if yes did you manage to solve the it? Or if it is ok to ask that here if anyone has an oracle account and is willing to send me the info from the article mentioned abovo, of course if there is something of interest for this specific problem in the article. 
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is happening across probably five or six vendors over the last year. Like the title says, if it isn't a critical P1 outage, the vendors seem to express zero interest in coming to a resolution for my problem in a timely fashion.
 With currently two of my tools from two different vendors that we are paying good money for, there's so many issues that are affecting the usability of the tool that it's practically worthless in it's current state and we are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a tool that we can't use because of issues with it. I have had to reach out to our CSM multiple times for both companies because the support technician keeps on saying that he will get back to me by the end of the day but two days later I haven't heard anything. I reach out to the CSM, and then magically within a few hours I have a support engineer beating down my digital door asking when we can schedule a phone call. The phone call takes place, I give them what they need, they say that they will get back to me. 2 days goes by with not a peep from them. Re-engage the CSM, and the cycle repeats. 
 With our firewall vendor, it takes an average of 8 days for a resolution, even the most simple of changes. I've brought this up to management multiple times and they say that we don't have the manpower right now to take our firewall duties in house nor do we have the manpower to research and negotiate a contract with a different firewall management company.
 I don't know if it's a staffing shortage or just poor management, but this is incredibly frustrating because I have management at my company asking why these issues aren't resolved yet and I hate shrugging my shoulders and telling them that I'm in a perpetual state of waiting for support to get their act together but it's the truth.

Newbusinessname.com vs OBN.com (if that makes sense). The cert on the on-prem machine is for the OBN.com and half our users don't even have that alias anymore, just the newbusinessname.com as their primary. There are no mailboxes on it, it is just a smtp server at this point or used to create new accounts. Accounts are on-prem by synced to Azure. All email is using Exchange online. First, do I even need this on-prem server? Second, what is the real need of an on-prem server? I am guessing I need it to handle the on-prem accounts email attributes. 
 I am just tired of cert errors and users being prompted for passwords for the old exchange server that just sits there and relays an email every now and then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the best way to go about recreating Python's virtual environment functionality, for a nice fresh Windows install? 
 I'm looking to create a persistent, separate clone of my installation that can handle its own program installs, config, etc without affecting my "clean" install. 
 If it sounds like I want Windows Sandbox, kind of - but I want it persistent. I know I could make a recovery image of my current windows install, but I'm trying to AVOID needing to restore to a previous date, and I want to use both 'environments'. I considered using a VM with an image of my setup, but AFAIK I'd end up with significantly reduced performance. Lastly, I know SOME applications allow you to install to single users, but some of the tools I need required admin. 
 The end goal is to keep my work tools separate, along with their associates config / dependencies / quirks within Windows; while my "main" environment stays clean and proper. 
 I know very little about Docker, but I wondered if I could put all those apps&dependencies into a container, and run them that way?
 Appreciate any input.

I've tried all the troubleshooting steps I can, and the adapter works flawlessly with the same hardware but a blank computer so I'm thinking it must be something about the GP/setup on the domain computers that's preventing it from completing the connection.
 When you press win+k it'll happily find any miracast screen, but it'll try to connect and then fail after about 20 seconds. I tried the troubleshooting steps below but everything seems fine. DXDIAG has it as supported, firewall is setup to allow wireless displays so I'm at a loss. I had a poke with Event Viewer but I'm either not looking in the right place or there's nothing there that indicates an issue.
 I am not the IT team, they're not supporting this and don't really know what miracast is and fed back that 'we don't support 3rd party apps' - this is not a 3rd part app so I'm guessing it's been inadvertently blocked due to something else.
 Oddly, it used to work about 3 years ago, then coming back off lockdown it now does not.

 it is me. Again.
 I am lost on this one and hope to find some aid.
 For my organization I have setup an IKEv2 VPN on our firewall. And it seemed to work fine, as my coworkers all use it without problems. But a few days ago one of our users approached me and asked when their problem is "finally solved".
 Which problem? I wasn't aware that there even is a problem.
 We had a few major internet outages three weeks ago, but those were resolved by our ISP. But since then, their VPN connections drop regularly, like every 1-2hours. The users thought, that these two problems were somehow related.
 While windows is still telling them, that the VPN Connection is connected, the firewall already decided to drop the connection, probably because of the DeadPeerDetection.
 I don't know who to ask exactly. The firewall is a fortigate. The OS is windows, and the vpn profile is setup in Intune.
 Does anybody have a tip for me? What can cause such a behavior?

 - Various Cisco Networking Devices (can forward to e.g. rsyslog)
 - Possible Windows Clients as well?
 Also we're running machines/endpoints/containers on:
 - MS Azure
 - GCP (Google Cloud)
 - OTC (Open Telecom Cloud)
 We're monitoring environments (at least part of them so far, WiP) with Icinga2, so integrations to that may be nice as well.
 So far I took a quick glance at Graylog and ELK, they seem to be the most prominent and obvious choices to look at. But I'm unsure about what of our environment may or may not be supported, so experiences are very welcome.
 Of course, alternatives to the two are as well.
 Thank you! :-)

 At first we've deployed the script using user configuration but it's not ideal because it asks an admin prompt. So we've done it using computer configuration but it just doesn't want to be deployed.
 Is it a recurring problem scripts that doesn't work as GPO? Or is it just us?

 For computer users that's easy (already in place) But for non computer users, can an account be created which resembles more of a placeholder or contact?
 I'd really like our Active Directory to be as closely aligned to HRIS as possible but for all the users who don't actually log into a computer this seems not so straightforward.
 Just in case your wondering what some use cases for this crazy ask is....
 I need to add all internal company phone numbers to the global address list and as HRIS is always the source of truth which syncs to AD, it seems logical for the users in the organisation to all appear in AD whether they are a computer user or not.
 Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

 Has anyone been seeing long delays with opening Safe Links re-written in Outlook and Teams?
 Delay can be anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes.
 Started yesterday for our tenant (UK) and still seems to be on-going.
 Opened a support case with Microsoft who initially advised that it was expected but pushed back mentioning that the delay is not normally this long. 
 Have since been told that a sync object repair has been initiated and to wait 24 hours. 
 Obviously I could turn off the safe links policy in the meantime but would rather not if I can help it.

 Long time lurker on the sub and just had a few questions. Bit of background of myself, currently a helpdesk guy looking to learn networking to move into a network admin role one day. The other day my boss showed me one of our comms room with a rack of live networking equipment. The rack consisted of multiple Aruba switches/controllers and Cisco router stacked on top of each other.
 My question is how would you go about moving all this equipment to another building? Would it simply be a process of unracking all the equipment and cables --> move equipment to another building --> rerack all the equipment and plug in all the cables?
 Another question is how do you guys keep track of which cables are plugged into which device? I've seen network diagrams before but are there diagrams for which cable goes where?
 My guess would be you would need to save the running configurations on all these devices and take pictures of all the cabling.
 Is there anything else you guys would consider?

 I have looked at:
 - GPO (only default domain policy is applied to everyone)
 - Fine grain password policy (we have none)
 And can't figure out why the one user cannot reset their password due to " This password does not meet the length, complexity, age, or history requirements of your corporate password policy." in SSPR
 They have the same license as everyone else in which they all have no issues resetting their password.
 We have a hybrid AD setup where Azure AD has been setup on an on-prem domain controller connecting to Azure.
 Is there anywhere else I can look at to troubleshoot?

 We hired a younger system administrator and he assumed administration of a number of services, to include the application mentioned earlier. 
 The vendor of said application no longer exists, but we’ve been able to keep it running on a windows server 2012 R2 (ha remember service packs?!) virtual machine. 
 Well, windows server 2012 R2 is going EOL this year. The young administrator asked what he should do and well no one really had a good answer. So the young admin must have taken a shot of whiskey and said fuck it because before we knew it he had upgraded the server to 2022! And the old application is still up and running as if nothing changed! 
 The young administrator has earned himself all sorts of street cred with this, honestly, ballsy (maybe reckless) move! Us senior admins and engineers all want to fast track him with more responsibility! 
 I told that story because I don’t see that kind of risk taking by junior admins and honestly I kind of loved it!

 We can see and access each other's labs, but when I try to access a device I get presented with a generic bash prompt. Like it's allowing me to access the emulator without the device image being present. 
 Is there a way for two users to simultaneously work on a lab together? If so, how do we go about it?

I reached out to the security company's helpdesk and they suggested nic teaming 2 of the nics to increase bandwidth. So I added nic 1 and nic 2 to a team along with the settings the help desk suggested. As it's adding the nics, it immediately errors out and states Faulted, not found on both nics, then the redundant nics 3 and 4 drop their connections. When I realized that the security camera server had no network, I immediately called a senior analyst over, and then the server became unresponsive. Since it was unresponsive, we rebooted it. It stayed on the "restarting" screen for apx 5 minutes and then blue-screened. Also, before it became unresponsive, I attempted a windows troubleshoot, and it gave me a "drivers" error. What could have caused the server to freak out.

Tons of results for the IP enabled version, as well as some other unit with a K in the model number, but NONE for this EXACT model. Those units have a different default username and password.
 So, I'm putting this on the internet for posterity. Hopefully Google scrapes this page and no one else is stuck in the same spot as I was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 Trying to get into deeper networking and I've been wanting to get into monitoring/analysis on my network so I'm looking to get some recommendations for this
 I have a couple of scenarios in which I'm trying to monitor/log certain packets being sent from a machine to the internet. 
  I have two PCs sending some data to a specific destination that I want to monitor on and store for analysis at a later date. Data is not encrypted on the wire.
 I have four PCs that sends some data out to the internet that I want to run through a self built TCP proxy to simulate some network conditions without running the proxy on any client.
 I was wondering if any of this is possible straight out of the switch itself via some configuration/port mirroring or if it's possible to build a proxy machine with 2 quad NICs where I could basically bridge 2 ports for data to come in and out before it gets sent to a switch on the network where I could maybe run my proxy on the to monitor and maybe alter data being sent between the NICs.
 Don't know if any of this is possible so any help would be gladly appreciated.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Again, Reddit! I've come to ask for some help with a port forwarding issue I've got going on.
 My edge/gateway device is a Sonicwall TZ215 running SonicOS 6.X. I have an A record as sub.domain.tld on my public DNS that points to this device's WAN interface IP. No issues there.
 My internal host is a Proxmox host running a few web servers. I have a port forwarding rule on the Sonicwall to reach the Proxmox web UI from the internet on HTTPS/TCP port 8006. I have an SSL certificate installed on the Proxmox host for sub.domain.tld. This works perfectly.
 I am now trying to add more web servers to this subdomain on other ports, i.e. https://sub.domain.tld:8443 and http://sub.domain.tld My issue is that I get an ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in my browser for any other port.
 My NAT configuration for the other two web servers that I'm trying to reach matches the NAT configuration for the working web server, the Proxmox host on https://sub.domain.tld:8006, except I created a service object entry for HTTPS/8443. That's the only difference. Still, I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.
 I did a packet monitoring in the Sonicwall appliance to try to isolate the issue and I see the traffic is being dropped to the internal hosts using 80 and 8443, due to "Error code 40 (Enforced firewall rule)".
 There isn't any kind of p@cket trac3r or traffic simulator like ASA has so I'm kind of at a loss. There really aren't any other firewall policies set up since this is a really basic and new configuration, so I can't imagine there'd be anything conflicting.
 The reachable web server and the non-reachable web servers are in the same network zone as defined by the Sonicwall, so it shouldn't be an access issue either.
 I can reach the web servers both internally and on a separate network segment for VPN. 
 I'm stumped, any ideas? Thanks in advance for anyone's input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying again as I lost the post I just typed. 
 Why do leavers from a non tech background of the role they work in, think it's acceptable in 2023 after they have decided to part ways with the company to demand a leaving "rider", after they handed the notice in?
 head of business and approvers above this allow it when they know it's more work to make a corp device into a personal one. Doing all of the admin alongside to make sure there is no data leak. 
 Then the business describes this year the same old thing we have no budget to invest in new systems, hardware, infrastructure or give bonuses due to the economic world. 
 We work incredibly hard all of us to keep the business running in a stable robust environment to prevent from breaches and other unknowns. I can say that and other IT admins will hopefully respect that. 
 Yet it just feels when you see a leaver asking you about the process of keeping my IT business assets when I leave it's like do we owe you that. It's not yours. It's the businesses. Yes you have a phone number that's the businesses line number. Your iPhone the one that says property of XYZ.com is again a business asset. Also the laptop which is a corp laptop with a corp image on it with corp licensing on it is not yours they still seem to think it's ok to ask for this when they leave like it's a sentimental thing ? 
 Then it comes your manager asks you to make sure they transition you off everything and give them the guidance you should of done this and that. In work hours when you have other actual jobs work related jobs to be doing. 
 Why do businesses not stand up and have a stern stance on this. They have a HR team they have policies and procedures and we chase users for not bringing kit back and holding final salary payment but the odd who dosent want to let go demands they want IT hardware as a parting gift. Opinions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was an SE at Verizon for a few years and one of the things that I did not realize before coming there was the distinction between an ILEC and CLEC. I realized that ILECs had certain legal obligations, but I didn't realize how different they were organizationally.
 Verizon (when it came to networking services, at least) was essentially split into 3 different companies:
  
Verizon Business (Long-Haul Network Services + CLEC)
 Verizon Telecom (ILEC)
 Verizon Wireless
  
I never quite understand why it was that ILECs were treated like different legal entities, as nothing I read suggested it has to be that way... I'm not sure if all service providers do this, but I know for sure that AT&T does. So for you old timers in telecom who understand a bit of the organizational/legal considerations surrounding networking, can you explain to me why it is that ILEC & non-ILEC services are often split into different companies?

 The team from AT&T says it is extremely difficult for them to look into their own accounting system to find out what they are billing us 🤷‍♀️ We are also transitioning from a managed billing consolidation to internal ap team and need to setup AT&T as a vendor. 
 ​
 I want to do the process right, but at the same time want to run away from AT&T. 
 ​
 My internal team is telling me that AT&T owns a lot of last mile circuits for many of our facilities. 
 ​
 Any thoughts on how to approach this ? 
 ​
 Essentially it's a mess out there. Any help / guidance will be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just thought I'd do a PSA for this in case anyone runs into this issue again. We had a request to make some NDI capable cameras work with OBS over our enterprise wireless (this particular SSID had to be created on our older Cisco 8510 due to the APs involved). The cameras themselves I believe are Mevo brand.
 After making some tweaks to get the cameras connected and accessible from the Mevo mobile app (client isolation was turned on in the WLAN config so easy fix), the next issue was that the devices were not being discovered as NDI camera sources in OBS. NDI uses mDNS but I was having issues finding the specific service string so we could add it to the mDNS snooping allow list. Ended up doing a packet capture to find it: 
 _ndi._tcp.local.
 Simple enough but even searching this in Google now that I know the answer didn't bring in a lot of results so I wanted to post this and hopefully it is helpful to someone in the future.

He said he would feel a little weird using it for work...like it's not his work. I said, "no...just another tool in the arsenal. How long have you been using StackOverflow or google to copy code?" You have to know code to tell it what to do so it's not like some dude off the street can explain how to create a complex function in powershell. 
 Anyway, how many other sysadmins have been actively using ChatGPT? What have you primarily used it for at work? And do any of your coworkers know? I'm a bit reluctant to even mention it to anyone else after that conversation.

Across all of those I have one VLAN which is our AV VLAN with about 180 devices of various types of AV equipment from Teams Rooms to Dante microphones/speakers, amplifiers, control systems and Crestron NVX encoders/decoders. Everything works perfectly fine. 
 I’m trying to add a new audio conferencing solution that needs to connect to some cameras using ONVIF for control. The main system sends out a discovery to the network to find any cameras. The cameras can also be manually added but then after populating the details it sends an ONVIF discovery probe to get all the details of the device. These processes don’t work at all on the AV network. If I change the addresses of these devices to any other subnet it works. 
 My assumption is that there’s too much traffic flying around on that network and the messages are getting blocked somehow. I’m at a loss as to how to rectify it though. All the stacks have 10gig uplinks with no saturation, igmp snooping configured, igmp querier set to collapsed core Nexus. Any ideas what I might be missing?
 Edit: I got it. It was an issue with MTU and jumbo frames.

Ran into an issue where someone had the labels swapped on our MPLS interfaces, went in and deleted all the tunnels because they were still showing src and dst as two different MPLS carriers. But it takes over an hour to orchestrate the changes.

The data plane uses an emulated Flow Processor (FP) that delivers Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-like performance that does not degrade as services are added.

At the minute I've created a prefix-list/route-map permitting the routes individually, but obviously this isn't hugely scale-able going forward.
 I saw a blog post that mentioned doing this with the next-hop option in a prefix list:
 ip prefix-list STATIC-NEXT-HOP seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 match ip next-hop 10.27.4.1 
 but I can't actually find this as a valid Cisco command anywhere, and even if it is it isn't available on my C9000.
 Seems there must be a simple way to do this but I can't figure it out right now!
 I also tried an access list with "permit ip any host 10.27.4.1 " and feeding this into a route-map but that didn't play along either.

 Long time lurker here. For the past 2 years I set up my own company and I have been working as a B2B contractor as a network engineer. This week, my main and only customer told me that they will no longer be requiring my services -- the (in)famous pink slip (or email, in this case).
 Won't get into too much detail in order to not breach the NDA, but it's one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. I was handling several DC's for them, and they decide they no longer need those DC/branch offices. They will be moving all their apps to the cloud, and all their personnel back to their HQ. They'll only have a skeleton crew at the locations which I manage, so that makes my role rather redundant. 
 The reason I opened this thread is not to complain ( I'm single, no obligations, no rent, and I have several certs, including CCNP Enterprise and JNCIS-SP), but I'm curious what is the status of remote work where you're currently at ?
 This contract was 100% remote. Since I got the news this week, I think applied to some 200 jobs already, and while I found some very interesting ones which were a good fit, and which paid even better than my current contract. However all of them required either hybrid or on-site presence. 
 Since the pandemic ended, what was the policy in your company in regards to remote/office hours ? And what do you think will be the future of remote work, especially for us ICT folks ? 
 Also, if you happen to know anyone looking for a 100% remote based network engineer, don't hesitate to reach out to me in private.

 We thought the user got the Administrator account password and was adding themselves to the Administrators group. That might not be the case here. 
 The user really isn’t computer savvy. They also haven’t made any changes ever to the system while having Administrator privileges. 
 We did change the Administrator password on that system a few weeks ago. We haven’t touched the system since. It seemed like maybe it was indeed the user making the group change somehow because it stopped for a while. Today, their account popped back into the Administrators group. There is no record of the Administrator account being logged into or used in order to make the group change. They are just magically in the Administrators group again. 
 We originally thought it was something related to the original sysprep of the system because they would get added to the Administrators group at almost every login. That doesn’t seem to be case here since it stopped for a while. We’re thinking it might be some system service or an application they launch that is adding them to the group?
 Any ideas on how to trace this? We’re already using Event Viewer to track the group change being made and confirmed in the GUI that they are indeed in the Administrators group.
 Any other ideas how this is occurring?

 Feel strange asking this as someone who has done networking for about 25 years now but this just seems so weird to me. I have never interfaced with Cisco Nexus before, and have no idea how this network is setup(other than badly). Just got access to the devices today.
 I'm trying to setup monitoring of the switches and one of the Dell switches is giving me trouble. It's not an issue with the switch, the issue is I can't ping that switch from some systems on the network but can from others. There are two switches side by side 172.16.1.23/16 and 172.16.1.24/16. The problematic one is .23, I cannot ping it from at least 2 different windows servers(internal windows firewall is disabled) on the same subnet but can ping it from a linux server on the same subnet.

 I was asked to create a NAT and firewall rule set from an external IP to a 3rd party controlled server dead smack in the middle of an important internal subnet.
 I have zero reason to believe anyone has set up comprehensive local device firewalls on the other devices in this subnet.
 I pitched the idea that they either review their individual firewalls, or create a DMZ for their new server, and only allow inside access to the items the 3rd party box 'needs'.
 NOPE! We're going to blast a goddamned hole in the perimeter with no further thought given. I have the proof in email that this is the choice that was made.
 Not only would I like to tell them to make these awful configs themselves, I'd like to tell them I won't help them when they get owned, and they should request someone else.
 What is the point in doing a job badly, and dutifully taking part in bad practices? I can get paid to do shit work in a thousand other places where nobody is experienced or conscientious enough to notice or care. I tried for something better, and now am subject to bad choices by unqualified high ranking functionaries.
 The second something goes wrong, I'm checking into the E.R. with a fatal case of 'I Told You So', and they can find another technician to bail them out.

 Shutting down your PC doesn't restart your computer. (not intuitive and a behaviour change recently)
 Restart, is the only way to reset and start fresh.
 In effect if you shutdown and turn on your PC every day of the year. It is effectively the same thing as having never restarted your PC for a year. At the end of the day you should hit the 'Restart' button instead of shutting it down."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll share as much detail as possible as this problem hasn't waivered. Keep in mind this is my first step up from IT specialist to sys admin so bear with me OGs.
 We are operating on a 2016 Windows Server and this holds all of our drives. The business is about 100 people. In November, I installed the .NET Framework 4.8(KB5020614) and the Update for Windows Server 2016(KB5019964). I have had non-stop issues with connectivity to the drives ever since. The errors string from "local device name is already in use," to "Target name is incorrect."
 I have found limited success in doing ipconfig/release-renew-flushdns. It's usually a 50-50 chance that the issue resolves after that. If I use the IP address to the server in the file explorer address bar, it immediately pulls up; its the complete opposite when I try to call it by its name \\server1\. I've checked the DNS and DHCP to see if they're properly communicating and there seems to be nothing wrong(not ruling them out).
 As recent as yesterday, I have started to force our user computers to use a different IP through the IPv4 in adapter options. For instance, I'll make 192.168.8.113 go to 192.168.8.204. I have found complete success with this and the most odd part is I can set the user machine back to automatically grabbing an IP address which will revert it to 192.168.8.113 and it instantly works. 
 It seems like I'm forcing the previous session to end and renewing the lease on the DHCP ??? I don't know but I'm open to all suggestions as my boss(the owner) grows in irritation. 
 Thanks ahead of time.

 Im having several discussion with both Cisco, OT vendors and customers regarding the best way to start such projects. Some says that SPAN/RSPAN into Micosoft Defender for IoT or equivalent product is sufficient, others say that SPAN will create problems and one must get Cisco cybervision and switches with sensors.
 Anyone have experience or some advise on what to keep in mind in different scenarios? I know that the Cisco solution works fine, but in big networks it will get really expensive.

 Something that i want to fix. I need to determine which users are utilising BYOD and how they are doing it to work out a plan of action.
 We use O365 and have DUO+Okta.
 Ideally, i would like a report of some description that shows logins from non-corporate devices.
 DUO reports do not give me the hostname of the device the user is logging in from, and i dont believe Azure logins do either. 
 In an ideal world i would just turn on the posture settings of DUO and see who screams, but that isnt going to go down well.
 I need to demonstrate the scale of this to upper management so they realise how many people do this and realise the exposure we have with data on personal devices etc etc. 
 Can anyone think of a good way to determine which devices logins to O365/DUO/Okta are coming from?
 Was thinking whether the install log from O365 apps gives telemetry of the device its installed on?

 We have here a classic on-prem Environement with a hyper-V cluster and mainly Windows Servers in Production. Now we have a new system that will run "dockerized", that environement is a composition of 7-8 containers that run together to deliver that service (mysql, redis, nginx and some other images).
 How do you deal with that "in general" regarding the management of such stuff?
 Do you create a bunch of linux hosts virtualised inside hyper-V and manage them with some container orchestrator (any tips - can be commercially backed and cost something)? So, something like a virtualized cluster?
 Do you build something completely "aside" like a bunch of synlogy nas with docker support? or even a complete new hardware cluster?
 Using windows servers for docker stuff does not make sense imho. 
 Thanks for any recommendation :)

 I support about 200 users in one company but need to support about 100 in other companies. I had been using real VNC but the customers hate it because I'm not on their computers so they have to invite me and right click is a challenge.
 I tried out meshcentral and it looks great but the developer may stop working on it.
 I need something very easy to use like teamviewer but probably more affordable and they seeem like the used car salesman of remote support.
 I definitely need multi monitor support.
 Quick assist is free but doesn't let you see when the pop up for admin comes up to install something and my users don't have local admin rights.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so while typing what was going to be the original post this has started working, but for no apparent reason. This has now gone from a request for help to a quest of understanding.
 So a while ago I was doing some fiddling with a client Synology, had created a new backup folder, unmapped the old one, attempted to remap the new one. "Invalid Password". Ok sure, that happens sometimes, thing is I didn't actually need the drive to be mapped as the backup software (backup assist) could see the location and access it with the given details so I figured it'd be fine. Decided to fix mapping the drive after the next scheduled reboot.
 Everything was not fine, turns out that despite being able to see and access the NAS, when attempting to actually perform the backup task it would fail as "unable to access the network location". Keep in mind, all I have done is make a new 2023 subfolder in the backup folder (we're MSP, they like it that way) and try to map it back after removing the 2022 folder.
 So I make a new user, try to map it with that, nope, same thing. Despite being able to log into the device with these same creds that Windows doesn't like.
 After that I restart things, bash my head against the wall a bit, find some other people who had similar problems that came about as the result of a setting change (none of mine have, double and triple checked), so I come here, begin writing my post, and mid way through I decide to try to map it one more time.
 It fucking works.
 And I haven't even done anything. I didn't even have to type the details in, it just immediately worked and mapped it like there'd never even been a problem.

 I am wondering if I should get a CCNA certification to maximize my chances of landing a role but I've heard from interviews (I've asked if the company offers this cert in interviews) that it's not required to do the role and the same goes with CNCI.
 There's an trainee installer role I've been interested in but they don't offer CCNA certification, only the CNCI. 
 I ask because taking CCNA will come out of my own pocket and if a Network Installer firm doesnt specifcally look for it and says its not needed then I wouldn't take it. I know that CCNA is one of if not the most popular IT course so it shocks me that a trainee position in a network role doesn't offer it as part of their programme.

 we have a big problem at our RDS System and our Print Server.
 I need more time to analyze it but i dont want the users to always call it so we can restart the print spooler.
 So here is my plan:
 i activated the log funtion in " Get-WinEvent Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational ". If the problem occours we can see it in the Event-ID 821 (which gets created everytime a print happens on the client that tells you the status. if its status 0x0 everything worked, if its not 0x0 there was a problem. In our case we always get the status code 0x6BA: example: https://imgur.com/a/kAOQJf3
 So i want an workaround for our endusers that automaticly checks if there is something different than Status: 0x0 in the 821 Event.
 The Question is how to do it right? I can create an trigger in the taskscheduluer for event 821 but keep in mind that in event 821 the successfully and failure prints are listed. Is there a way with custom XML-Filtering? 
 Can someone give me a tipp or example for the right direction?
 ​

We had this the first time in the beginning of February with about 2,5 million request over 4 days. Annoying but not something our webserver could not handle. Did an abuse report to Azure as it was an IP address in their space. 
 Yesterday at 1am a new scan started, again from a Azure IP address. Did a new abuse report but after 750000 request I had enough and blocked the IP address around 2pm, to my surprise the second I blocked te IP address the pattern moved from 1 IP address to random IP addresses from all over the world. At this moment I have more than 19000 IP addresses. The rate of requests has slowed down but still we see around 15000 requests an hour. 
 Anybody experienced this?
 My idea is removing the wildcard entry and just add the necessary subdomains to our DNS (would be around 70-100), my co-worker however things it is useless.

 Also yes I've got a break glass account with multiple 2FA methods. Don't like having an account without MFA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the early stages of getting started with Ansible for some network automation. Currently, use cases are small for now (update helper-addresses, NTP servers etc) but I expect to go further down the rabbit hole and maybe leverage it for full site deployments.
 Anyway, one of the things that is being discussed is integration with Jenkins CI/CD. As a pure network engineer, I honestly have no idea how Jenkins works and what is involved with it and why it would be beneficial to us but none the less I will need to research it.
 So first question, is there any resource out there (book, blog, youtube etc) that gives some good insight into Jenkins purely from a network perspective? 
 And finally, is Ansible Tower considered CI/CD? Ansible Tower to me seems just like a GUI for pushing playbooks which would obviously make it more user friendly for someone who want to push a playbook but not have to write the code in Ansible. Example, would be that I create a bunch of playbooks and someone else who is not fully up to speed, could just come along, modify the variables to the relevant devices, and then push it out. Is this what Jenkins tries to achieve?

 We have a new Firepower1150 we are attempting to add to our FMC. We see traffic arriving on both ends using TCP dumps, however it keeps throwing a "could not establish connection with device" error. 
 In the pigtail logs i see the sftunnel establishing, then it seems like it keeps looping on this "sfmgr:sfmanager [INFO] Waiting for RPC service to be published on peer"
 If anyone has encountred this issue before any and all help would be apreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning all,
 Work for a CSP and we have an Excel sheet that we copy + paste each month to record backups for customers, each backup type (i.e. offsite or onsite) and what we back up (physical server, VM's). To record success/failure - each cell has a tick box. We get emails to a specific shared mailbox for the backups, so the process of recording the backups is to check the folder for a given client, tick if the expected backup succeeded, go on to the next (and of course if there isn't a tick, investigate why).
 Problem being that it's pretty slow to load several thousand tickboxes and as soon as we create a new backup/new customer it completely drags it down. We create a new document every month. It's been this way for a few years but given the recording of backups takes 30 minutes a day and feels like a early 2000's solution - feeling there's got to be a better way.
 What're you doing to record your backups?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company has gone fully remote over the last few years and might be looking at terminating a remote employee. We are a fairly small company and to be honest, haven't had to fire any once since we have been full remote. I still need to work out the details with HR, but I got the impression this will be over a teams call. Our business works with a lot of customer data that this individual has access to, and want to cut that access almost instantly after the call. Here is a bit about our environment:
 User has a laptop that is Intune enrolled. We have our DCs in Azure and use a lot of the typical MS services such as teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.. This particular user has some of our customer files SharePoint doc libraries synced with OneDrive to his local machine.
 If while we are on the call, his password is changed, SharePoint and files access removed, doesnt this take some time to sync? I believe the last time I removed some ones Azure files access, they had it for several more hours. Is this the same for Sharepoint? We do have "Automate" installed on his machine, so I could force a reboot, but if he is not on the VPN at the time, the password might not sync and still be cached. I did some research and saw there is a registry item that can be changed.
 Although I could wipe the machine with Intune, I do want to be able to go through the machine and make sure he does not have local files that need moved to a project directory on the network. 
 Will a password change instantly cut his access on his phone as well, or do I need to revoke those tokens as well?
 I would appreciate any suggestions to make this as streamlined as possible, its not something we are particularly excited about having to do, but they are leaving us no choice.

 I have browsers setup to open two tabs for two separate systems when a user launches a browser.
 When a user opens a browser and number match is enabled, the user gets two different two digit codes for entering into their authenticator app. One for each tab.
 Is it possible to have a single code for the two tabs that are launching simultaneously or is this just the way it works?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I need a way to analyse if OS packages (OEL/RHEL/Ubuntu/Debian) are vulnerable to a CVE's. Most vendors have an oval file that describes "package with version lower than XXX is vunrable".
 I have an ansible playbook that gathers all the packages and writes them to a server (a file per host)
 I know there are a lot of tools and ways to see if a system in vulnerable to an CVE (oscap/vuls...). But nothing that is actually without installation of the tool on the server itself.
 So I was wondering if there are tools/scripts that just have a parser of OVAL with an input "a package or a package list"
 something like
 cvereport.py -i server_packages.list -o oval file.
 I know oscap-ssh exist and that might be a solution. Vuls also looks like it is agentless but I want to avoid having "another inventory to maintain" (ansible and vuls)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this may be a stupid question and maybe I'm reading too much into it, but here's where I'm unsure:
 I deal with Cybersecurity Insurance Questionnaires for our clients. A lot of times it'll ask if server databases are encrypted at-rest, and from my understanding and from what tools we use, this is basically asking "Is Bitlocker enabled on server data disks?" and the answer is typically No.
 However now I have this question for a client who's servers are all Azure VMs. These do not have Azure Disk Encryption enabled, which from my (potentially limited) understanding, means Bitlocker is not enabled on the virtual disk. However, Azure VMs by default live on Microsoft's data centers, and the physical disks in those data centers have server-side encryption (SSE) 
 So my question is... does this count for at-rest encryption as far as this cybersecurity questionnaire is concerned? Because from my (again, probably limited) understanding, at-rest encryption is intended to protect against someone getting access to the physical disk, and sure this would prevent it if someone broke into the Microsoft data center and somehow stole the disk this VM lived on so that would seem to make the answer to the question "Yes" in the most technical sense. But if someone gained access to the Azure environment & stole the VHD file, then Bitlocker isn't enabled on that file and could presumably read all the contents then it's like... was at-rest encryption really even on? Is at-rest encryption explicitly a protection against physical data breaches? Or should at-rest encryption include VM disk encryption when the server in question is a VM?
 Or maybe I'm thinking too hard about this?

 We just started to receive a few calls from users informing us, that some Microsoft Apps on iOS seem to be stuck on updating.
 Looks like they are being offloaded by iOS, guessing by settings > general > iphone storage, but to my suprise, the offloading setting isn't even accessible/visible under settings > app store > app offloading.
 Unfortunately, those devices are DEP and MDM enabled AND the Company Portal App (Intune) is also offloaded, so those other apps are never gonna get updated due to "broken" devices. 
 Best workaround is to fully reinstall the device, which is cumbersome.
 ​
 Does anyone have a clue on how to prevent or undo this? I couldn't find an MDM switch for this Intune or on the web.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We managed a bunch of RDS Collections for several customers, we deploy the RDP file that is generated as part of this that you can download from RDWeb after the collection is setup, this is the file that's digitally signed as part of the setup - generally this just "works".
 All of a sudden yesterday morning we got a report of an error on a customer when trying to connect into their collection, the error appears when double clicking the RDP file:
 "The digital signature of this RDP File cannot be verified. The remote connection cannot be started."
 Interestingly, some users still worked fine however, and these were users sat next to each other in the same office.
 Now, we've seen issues where the signature can throw off the RDP file sometimes so we edited the file in notepad and removed both the "signscope:s:" and "signature:s:" values, this allowed it to work, obviously this bypasses the whole "digitally signed" part of the file.
 We checked the usual before this, ensuring all the certificates were valid etc. (they were) and no weird updates had been applied to clients or the relevant servers (they hadn't) so we deployed this file to affected users.
 However, we then got a report from another customer with the same issue, then a third reported the issue. Our initial thought being some sort of CA issue, but two of these customers used Sectigo, the other was R5/GlobalSign so that ruled that idea out.
 We couldn't find a reason for this so eventually just had to remove those two lines from the files and it seemed to resolve the issue. A cursory glance around the Internet only really flagged this issue when using self signed certs, we aren't.
 Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! At the moment we have only seen this at 3 (maybe 4) customers but obviously don't want to see this get more widespread!
 As an additional point, the RDP file "breaks" regardless of where it's used from, so it doesn't look to be the originating network that's the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been experiencing a weird issue with my production dell L3 router S6000-ON. Once a week or soall of its port-channel members ungroup and then immediately group back up (I have lacp long-timeout set). I turned on RSTP and LACP debug events but it essentially just logs the fact that those ports ungrouped and not the reason why they did it in the first place. No alarms or other environmental thresholds were reached. I'm trying to find some kind of event or traffic burst in my network to explain these events but it is difficult. I'm trying to think of ideas of what I could check to figure this one out.
 I changed the firmware from the older to the latest but it didn't seem to have any effect.
 ​
 I noticed some possible causality on one of my access switches connected to the router. I was migrating my router from old hardware to new and the issue of port-channel flapping moved to the new after moving this particular access switch (although I can't be sure). I noticed that port-channel for that switch has counter for "giants", but I'm not sure if that can have any affect on the switch itself (giants = packets that are greater than the MTU size).

 On the router itself, I noticed dozens of connections from our internal workstations on the LAN, going to handfuls of the same destination IP addresses located at various Akamai CDNs on port 443. The issue had gotten so bad, that I had to block the offending connections at the router level just to stop it from causing all of this packet loss, because it was maxing out our internet connection, and our Mikrotik CCR1036 router couldn't handle it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Are there any guides for how to administer FIDO physical security keys like Yubikeys for an entire team/organization?
 The biggest hurdle I would expect to see is a user losing their key. I don't understand how organizations which require all users have physical keys handle this on an administrative level, and I am struggling to find any real world examples/best practice documentation on it. 
 I understand for any account fully controlled by your organization (such as Microsoft 365) that a lost key can be handled from an administrative portal. But how do you handle a lost or broken key on accounts that you do not have full administrative control over, such as a social media account? If you require your staff to register a backup key, does that not create other issues (my knee-jerk reaction is end users would end up carrying the backup with them so they can always have it to register both at once, or would forget to bring in the backup key so it never gets registered, both of which defeats the purpose of the backup key) or do you require that the IT department register additional keys on MFA setup?
 Am I overlooking something obvious, or is this just something that sysadmins just deal with? It would seem to me that the best way of solving this would be if a YubiKey/similar product could be "paired" so that one key could register both itself and a cold backup key that is stored elsewhere (held by IT in a corporate use case) without having to carry both.
 Thank you for any insight,

 (I have kind of the same issues as mentioned in this thread.) 
 I am working with ansible automation towards different cisco switches in my company and I have specific issue with VTY lines on IOS-XE 17.x 
 So on 17.03.04(9600) it looks like this: 
 9600(config)#line vty ? <0-97> First Line number 9600#show run | incl line vty line vty 0 4 line vty 5 15 
 And on 17.06.04(9300) it looks like this: 
 9300(config)#line vty ? <0-98> First Line number 9300#show run | incl line vty line vty 0 4 line vty 5 15 line vty 16 31 
 And that in itself is okey(pretty f'ing annoying tho), but the problem is when i try to remove excessive lines.
 On the 9600 it's no problem, but on the 9300 i get this error:
 % Can't delete last 32 VTY lines 
 Anyone has experience with this, and what did you do to solve it?

 We just bought some licensed LTE spectrum , so our CBRS LTE will now be accompanied by real licensed LTE. 
 Id really like to know how all of this stuff gets implemented. Ever since I started here back in August of last year, I've been trying to find some reading material or some sort of course on this stuff but not really sure where to start.
 Anyone here know LTE pretty well? If so, what resources did you use to develop your proficiency on the topic?

 Anyone have a way to do this with native tools? Perhaps something along the lines of using PS to output disconnected sessions on each session host, then outputting the processes each session has, looking for chrome.exe?

 I am trying to integrate Checkpoint firewall with Aruba ClearPass for TACACS. I couldn't find any dictionaries available for CheckPoint in ClearPass or even the profiles. The plan is to configure basic AAA services with Checkpoint read-only, read-write and super admin roles. Can anyone please help me with the configurations to be done at both Checkpoint and ClearPass side?
 Thanks in advance!!

I try to call support and I am not permitted to speak to a human unless I go thru the troubleshooting process which will have me restart the modem. That will fix the issue. There is no way to report an intermittent issue. 
 Any way on to the issue: my ssid is similar to xxxxxHome. After not doing the modem reset, I got to a tech. They said that any ssid that contains the word “home” causes issues. Must be a new feature, because the ssid hasn’t changed in years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so I have a real strange one. Windows 11 (why did I upgrade)?? Outlook 365 (NEWEST VERSION) after about 4 hours becomes unresponsive and when restarting the application it will get stuck on LOADING PROFILE. Like all good sysadmins I did my google searching forever on this and there is not one thing (rebuild profile, reinstall Office, repair OST, rebuild OST, turn off bad add-ins that do nothing but slow you down, reset the navpane, everything) that hasn't worked. The ONLY thing that works is once it gets into that state, a quick reboot fixes it for another 4 hours. I keep saying 4 hours because it's been close to clockwork when it happens 4-5 hours later.
 Talk about an annoying piece of crap. We all can have our rants on crappy MSFT software updates and programming. However, I have had a few other users with the new version of Outlook with similar issues, but the beforementioned methods have worked (but it eats up precious time none of us have). The difference with my users is they are all Windows 10, and I was the idiot that was smart enough to upgrade to Windows 11.
 Any thoughts? Other than the IT guy is an idiot (I hate that I can't even figure out my own stupid issue)? Sure, I can drag MSFT into it (and probably will if I can't get it figured out) but I thought I would turn to the much smarter guys first.
 Edit 1: Outlook will still hang even with an attempt to load in Safe Mode...
 Edit 2: I have deleted fully all OST's and rebuilt from the server twice now, not that either..

 These objects are further called into custom 'links', that will show as a button called 'Wireless management' with the underlying url defined as https://{{ obj.cf.WLC_Managment.address}}:{{ obj.cf.port }}
 As I'm using the wlc IP address and the port as the object type, the URL always includes the subnet mask as shown below
 https://10.1.1.10/24:4343
 I can use 'text' in custom field instead of an 'IP address' object and get around the issue, but would like to see how I can use the IP address as an object and remove the subnet mask from the URL.
 I tried the following but that didn't work
 https://{{ obj.cf.WLC_Managment.address | split('/') | first }}:{{ obj.cf.port }}
 anyone know how do I get the url as https://10.1.1.10:4343 in netbox

 ​
 Happening across many companies and different Windows servers from 2012 R2 to 2019.
 ​
 The cert on the RD Gateway is fine but the certs are all issued by Sectigo so perhaps that's the issue.
 ​
 Quick fix is to backup the RDP file and remove the signing details from the end. 
 ​
 Is anyone else seeing the problem?

 I've looked at a lot of options; Mimecast Web Security, DNS Filtering products (Umbrella, WebTitan, DNSFIlter) and nothing has blown me away. All have weird quirks, seem quite easy to circumnavigate. I hear the next "step" is to go to some form of CASB, but wondered what your thoughts were?

 I'm running 3rd software on Windows Server 2016 on VMWare.
 AFAIK , The idea behind the so-called 'best-practice' of 1.5x RAM has its roots in the 1990's when RAM was very expensive. 
 There is a lot of advice out there talking about setting the size to 1.5 or 2 times the size of the memory that is installed.

 A month ago i switched out my firewall at home to a box running OPNSense. At that time i also started using VLANs. The plan was to move everything out from default LAN and i started moving some servers to VLAN 100 (MGMT) (they were already joined in the AD at that point).
 IP numbers of the servers in question:
  
DC01 192.168.1.201
 DC02 192.168.1.202
 ADM01 192.168.100.140

 Vlan 10 and 50 are picking up dhcp but not internet Vlan 30 still works fine and so does vlan1 - these are on different wans so the internet is working fine on both wans.
 I've restarted DNS. Renewed dhcp etc but can't figure out where it's going wrong.

I’m keen on setting up a VLAN for my CCTV at home to minimise chances of my CCTV being hacked, as well as reducing the chances of other devices in my home network getting their security compromised.
 How do I go about doing this and does it cost a lot to setup a VLAN for my home CCTV? It would be great if I could have an idea of the exact equipment I need to purchase as well as a cost breakdown. Further, is it really necessary to have a VLAN set up to prevent an occurrence of hacking in a home network?
 I don’t have much technical knowledge in this aspect so a layman explanation would be very much appreciated. Thank you!

 I'll try to keep it as short as possible and go straight to the point:
  
Within our company we all make use of Office365.
 We make use of a Hybrid Azure AD system.
 One particular colleague has the issue that he keeps losing connection to the Exchange server within Outlook. This always happens after 1 or 2 hours of working.
 All other applications keep working fine.
 He closes Outlook to restart it again, yet Outlook won't start anymore then.
 He has to reboot his laptop to make it work again, only to have the same problem occur after 1 or 2 hours again.
  
I'm running into a dead end what I can try here, this is what I've tried so far:
  
Quick repair of Office in Control Panel
 Online repair of Office in Control Panel
 Reinstalling Office
 Enabled Wireless Radio Control within BIOS (read somewhere that enabling this could help with the issue, unfortunately it didn't).
 Reset the user's password through www.office.com, while connected directly on our company network (to make sure the sync between Azure AD and our on premise AD is done correctly, as this has been an issue sometimes in the past).
 Removed the Outlook profile and made a new profile.
 Probably countless other things that I can't think of right now.
  
Does anyone know what else I can try? It's getting really annoying, especially for the end user.
 ​
 Thanks a lot for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slightly strange request....\
 I've been tasked with setting up temporary wifi and internet for a building. There are 3 floors and each floor is c. 80m x 50m. The floors are largely open - no walls, just empty space. We do not have access to the building's internet and we may (or may not) have access to normal consumer-level electricity supply.
 It just needs to be be there for a couple of weeks. 50 wifi temperature sensors will beplaced on each floor and will connect to the wifi and transmit their small amount of temperature data to a cloud service.
 I'm thinking we will likely need three 4G mobile internet routers (one per floor) and then a wifi access point (or more than one) for each floor. And possibly a UPS for each floor to supply the power to them - although hoping that electricity will be possible.
 No floor-to-floor cabling will be allowed and only minimal, exposed cabling allowed on each floor.
 So I guess my questions are chiefly:
  
Will one WAP per floor be able to deal with 50 low-data devices and the 80mx50m area?
 If so (or if not) what devices would you recommend
 Anything else I ought to be thinking about?
  
Thx

 I have an interesting problem. We are a small ISP/MSP and our upstream provider told us that users from two of our /24 IP ranges send very excessive DNS queries asking for the IP address of a.root-servers.net (their engineer told me that there were times when it surpassed google by a significant margin, even distorting their statistics for site queries).
 Now I am wondering what could even cause this; especially as there is very little overlap in infrastructure between the two IP ranges (and one of the ranges have a significant infra overlap with other unafected ranges)? Have any of you seen anything similar ever? Could it be a bug caused by a auto update of a common CPE brand?

 Those credentials (SSO) allow me to sign into macs and windows computers, not only the one in my desk but also any public terminals (library), albeit my documents only stay on my desktop Mac (they don’t sync to any Mac I log into). 
 Staff can bring their own devices and are able to use their SSO to access MS office, PeopleSoft (student information system), VPN, Adobe, DocuSign, Canvas, etc, all of which are downloaded directly from the developers or are web-based. Mixing personal documents with work documents isn't discouraged because the important stuff (student records, financial stuff) can only be accessed on campus with school WiFi or a VPN for remote work.
 It seems only on-campus Macs and PCs are managed with MDM. If an employee prefers to not use their own computer for work, they can be issued an on-campus computer, in which software is downloaded through a program. 
 What is the technical description for this type of system? How can one replicate this for their own organization? 
 Is it easier to use cloud based products and manage a SSO instead of deploying and managing devices?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We are about to migrate some customers to azure ad joined devices. They are all domain joined right now. We would love to keep the user data / settings and move it to the new azure ad joined profile on the device. It would also be great to migrate the installed printers to the new profile. How would you guys handle this?
 Edit: As some extra information, the reason why I am asking is. This company has users who feel very special, entitled, we already have to do some 1 on 1 sessions to make sure everything is allright. So we will touch all the devices, but some of them are not very IT knowledgeable and would freak out because there printer is not working or something is wrong with their device
 I have no issue in using third party tooling if it would make life easier for the users...

 I’m having trouble making much sense of sticking around here.
 Are there any job boards or sites that show companies willing to relocate/work visa sponsor someone? Just myself and a couple of cats… want to get far away from all of this.
 Looking for I.T. related sites/information that you can pass along to help me out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, has anyone had any experience with Dialpad VoIP system in Australia/New Zealand. We have recently shifted a portion of our business to use the cloud service to replace the previous telephone system but have noticed significant latency issues especially at the start of calls. My gut feeling says as the call session initiates with the "Global SIP Network" as they call it, it gets rerouted quite a bit which slows it down. I'd just like to know if anyone else has had subpar performance for Dialpad in Aus or NZ?
 Note) Did an Ookla speed test with an end user today reporting issues and they 278 down 114 up with 4ms to server, so I'm thinking very unlikely an issue on our side.

The CEO, CIO and President have built a habit of calling our help desk techs directly (or emailing / chatting in Teams), anytime they need IT assistance (even non-emergency ones). They have never submitted a ticket, which is what we want them to do. But they won't listen, no matter how kindly we ask.
 their secretaries typically will submit tickets for them. But that rarely happens since they don't go to their secretaries first when something goes wrong.
 Part of us is like, "eh, they are at the top of the pyramid.. whatever.. just help them then open a ticket for them and move on." Another part of us is like "no, they need to follow IT policy like everyone else!"
 Just curious if this is an issue for the companies you work for? And how strongly you enforce the "open a ticket before I can help you" policy with the "higher-ups?"

 just hoping for some assistance. 
 It's a bit of a noob question, but im struggling to understand and implement 802.1x auth on my office's wifi.
 I've created an nps server, added the Meraki AP's, added the secret to the AP's, and configured meraki to go to the NPS server. But my sticking point is installing and correcty configuring the certificate my boss gave me for the task.
 I've had very little to do with certs and whilst I understand the concept of pki I don't understand how to implement in practice.
 Like I put the ssl cert in the personal store on the server and the 802.1x policy then let me choose it as the certificate to authenticate against. But then what part do i need to add to a users computer, and how do i get that out to them?
 I've just become massivley confused and would love if someone point me in the correct direction.

I have tried a couple of things such as re-plugging the HDD, resetting the BIOS, performing System Restore, Booting into Safe Mode but as you guess it, everything failed. The error persists, now I'm down to the last resort which is to reinstall windows but before going thru that, I was wondering if there is any other things I could try?
 Edit: I have also tried running chkdsk /f /r and sfc /scannow but both didn't help much. The chkdsk didn't find any bad sector. The disk have 4 partition and everything is correctly labelled such as C: Windows, D: New Volume, and also 1 Recovery partition and another system reserved partition. It seems like it does detect the HDD but couldn't access the boot sector? I might be getting the wrong idea but that is what I understand.
 Edit 2: I decided to just reset the PC since I don't have all day and user need it fast. I thank you for the suggestions that everyone gave me.

Before that I used to fix network issues on a basic level remotely. I was chosen because I was very interested in networking, internet and I would study at home while others wouldn't. I have learned to configure switches like Alcatel, HP, 3Com, Nortel, Dlink, Dell, Netgear on a basic level. Vlans, port isolation, loop protection, troubleshooting why it wouldn't work. We have only mikrotik dude to monitor entire network. We use only mikrotiks.What would be the best network monitoring software to monitor network for free? I can't take care of my network if I can't see what's going on in it properly. The dude only displays bandwith after 24hrs. Service up, down with notification to telegram is setup so we can react quickly. Zabbix + grafana, prometheus + grafana?How to take care of network properly? What to monitor? What are free gpon monitoring tools? Zabbix seem to increase cpu load of gpon. I have basic understanding but I want to get better and take care of my network. I have to take care of a few data rooms, switches, security, I need to see what's going on my network in switches, gpon, I want to get better at this. I was working for free to get any experience previously just to get hired somewhere. I found my favorite thing. Networking. When I like this, I have motivation. Could you help me? I need good material how to take care of network properly. Thanks. I'm not alone there's a Senior Network Admin that takes care of servers, the work load is huge, when to learn? :) I want to help him. I'll put less stress on him by taking care of my side of network. Help me a bit. Thanks! I feel like CCNA + Mikrotik Courses would be best atm. Which I'm going for.

 There are existing cables run in the cavity - lighting, data, AV etc., as well as HVAC ducting
 There are some existing vertical metal rods, and some of the cables are cable tied to those - however, in general, most of those are loose, and there aren't that many rods.
 My question is - if you were running new CAT6A cabling in this space - would you put the cables in some kind of conduit? Or how else would you keep them supported and tidy, and also in case you wanted to change them later? (I seem to remember something vaguely about supporting them in bundles, but can't find the reference).
 Or would you just loose lay the cable on the gyprock ceiling itself?
 Or what other techniques do people use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello networking !
 I have a quick question for any pro installers out there. 
 I'm in the process of commissioning my new recording studio and I have my friends teenage son who's interested in systems integration/audio production (kids these days) on site after school to help out with testing and to learn some wiring skills. 
 I'm teaching him to terminate RJ45's and having him try to make some short ethernet cables (the first of which have been deliciously atrocious) and I wanted to give him a sense of what would be expected in a pro environment in terms of skills.
 I'd categorize my personal networking install level as apprentice+, this will be my third studio I've wired and with various other projects I'd say that I've terminated maybe 600-700 cables in my "career". I had to terminate about 60 cables for this one and I messed up 2. 
 From the audio wiring perspective I've probably terminated 6k balanced channels and I'll mess up maybe 1 in 150ish. 
 My question is what the error rate would be for a professional installer, I'm guessing it would be 1 in 200ish but frankly I don't have a clue. 
 Any edification would be much appreciated, also would be curious as to how long it took any of you to learn this skill.

 I work full-time IT at a non-profit organization and there really isn't a ton of work to do. I work under an IT director and we're just a 2 man department.
 My boss is a total workaholic and it's hard to get him to delegate stuff to me, so I feel like working with him is a competition in my own head to try to jump on top of any work to be done because if I don't do the work within 5 minutes of it coming up, he just does it.
 Because the org isn't terribly large, we end up running out of work to do pretty quickly, and I start to get a little nervous that I'm not doing enough, or that I might get laid off or something if I don't continue to prove my worth to the org.
 The org I work for is actually awesome. I know a common perspective people have is to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck because "coporate overlord dont care about you, employee," but this org has been amazing to everyone with very generous compensation, org-wide raises that consist with inflation and THEN some, great benefits, and an overall healthy and productive environment/community of people.
 So, I really want to be doing more and being more useful because I feel like i just don't do anything all day and it's eating away at my soul every night lmao.
 anyone got any good suggestions? how do you keep growing when there isn't a fire under your ass?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a small company. Recently, I have been tasked with setting up a VPN server so that employees can access certain company resources remotely. I contacted the ISP and requested a static IP address block. However, I am unsure how to respond to the ISP's followup question about the configuration.
 For context, we are using CenturyLink/Lumen as the ISP and our hardware is part of the Unifi family. We originally planned to use an OpenVPN server, but recently discovered it was possible to run a VPN server directly on the Unifi hardware.
  
Your new LAN IP block is aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa/29 and it is statically routed to bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb. However, how would like us to configure the new IP block on the managed CPE, is there a specific interface you prefer for us to configure the new block on or statically route it to your LAN (Which next hop IP should we use) so you can use the whole /29 block?
  
What does "interface" mean in this context? Is this something on their end, or does this refer to our own hardware? Should I tell them to statically route the block to our LAN and provide the local IP address of our (network gateway? router?) as the next hop?
 I apologize if this is a stupid question, but our consultant has not been much help with this and I am a fish out of water here.
 Thanks!

However since they only gave me midrange on the salary I counteroffered near the top end and then they just said "I had withdrawn myself from the position". This was after I pointed out it was a 100% onsite job and that their offer was not commensurate* (edited, thank you /u/mudclub) with the cost of living in the area, especially housing. 
 There's a big difference between withdrawing and being lowballed.
 I'm interested to hear from my fellow sysadmins on how salary negotiations have gone from an offer to employment or to just turning your back on a potential employer.

One server and one storage array that needs to remain on. And another server I can shut off.
 Has anyone ever, with equipment mounted, slid the posts forward or back? It requires loosening a couple nuts, but they're in a track so it doesn't look like any equipment could actually drop. But obviously I'm most concerned about vibration, and that's the top reason I think this is a really bad idea. All three sets of rails mounted in the rack are adjustable depth.

We are expanding and have bought a building about 100 yards away for part of the office to move to. We have already installed a new modem/router from our ISP on a separate account and have it up and running. Now that the situation is explained I want to know the best way to go about this problem. 
 The people that are moving from building A into building B still need access to a shared file that is hosted on one of the windows computers. (not the way I would create a file-sharing system but it is what I have to work with.) The plan is to connect the network from building A to the new building B so they can access the locally shared file. I want to configure it so they can access the locally shared file on that network but the new ISP connection will handle all of the actual internet access. 
 Any help or recommendations would be appreciated. Feel free to ask about anything I left out.

 It originated from dealing with some of the server folks or helpdesk folks seeming to imply I'm responding with "it's not the network" without actually looking, so instead I prove I'm looking and showing them what I see to sort of "nip in the bud" any implication that I'm being dismissive, but now I do it out of habit.

 I can snmpwalk to that device successfully, and I have the same credentials configured within Netdisco (Which I believe USES the net-snmp library) but no luck at all no matter what I try. 
 Netdisco works great with our AES128 devices.
 Any tips on what I can try to get Netdisco to communicate to devices using AES256 or AES256C?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, 
 So I’m new to packet loss issues – this is my second network job but first time I’ve had to deal with it. So it seems like there is intermittent packetloss stemming from one specific device in our network… our Nexus 7706. At random times nodes all over our network stop responding and the common denominator is they are all patched to the 7706. They don’t all go down at once but when an event occurs you can be assured it’s patched to the nexus. It’s very random in both the time it happens as well as the devices it happens to – but again all uplinked to the 7706. 
 So my question is – where would I begin on troubleshooting this? Any real world advice here? This is where those damn ccna books do nothing for you… and unfortunately I’m a one man shop so I don’t have anyone to seek guidance from.

        <updated>2023-02-28T15:23:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am configuring a 3900 from FS (first one I've purchased from them) and it will be used as a WAN switch sitting between the ISP equipment to share the connection to two firewalls in an HA config (active/standby). There is a second ISP that connects to the HA firewalls and the equipment from that ISP has multiple ports for WAN and a WAN switch isn't needed on the second ISP link.
 It is a 24 port switch and I plan on using interfaces 1-12 for the WAN VLAN (to avoid using VLAN 1 and all 24 ports). I've already added the WAN VLAN and added those ports to that VLAN.
 The mgmt interface will be used for local access/configuration.
 Here are my questions (so far).
  
I'm going to confirm LLDP isn't active on ports 1-12.
 I'd like to configure SNMP to only send data to my internal SNMP server. I've seen switches/network devices that have fields/commands to send SNMP data to specific servers, but I've also left those fields blank and I can still log into my NMS and pull SNMP data from the switch given I have the correct information.
  
I'm currently reading through the 3900 manual to confirm the LLDP and SNMP commands, but I wanted to see if anyone here had any other suggestions that I may be missing to avoid leaking out data/information that should be avoided on the WAN side.
 Traditionally we've never done anything fancy to WAN switches, they are just L2 switches that we throw into the mix and we've also never had any management other than a local console cable IF a change needed to be made. Going forward, I'd like to change this and given that I have a local network port for management, I'd like to secure this switch the best way that I can.
 The default credentials have already been changed.
 Thanks.
 Edit- In other switches I've used, the management port is usually listed as out of band. I haven't found that to be the case for this 3900 switch.

 I'm experimenting with a Juniper SRX and it seems static routing isn't as straight forward as it would be on a Cisco.
 I have my SRX connected to an L3 switch, with a network either side. On the L3 switch I've issued the static route command and set next hop as the Juniper interface that connects to the L3 switch.
 I added a static route in on the Juniper also, with next hop as L3 switch interface. However, when trying to ping from the Juniper network into the L3 network, my gateway comes back with destination net unreachable. In fact, when I logon to the Juniper over SSH, and try pinging the L3 switch interface, I get "no route to host" and when I look at the Juniper routing table, I see an entry for the L3 switch interface listed as a "rejected".
 I read somewhere that you can't simply add a static route onto a non point-to-point link on a Juniper. If that is the case, can someone explain how I can configure a basic static route on here?
 Many thanks

 While doing this, I saw a ticket for our MS licensing. Well, it's been ok with everyhting else I have thrown at it, so I asked it:
 "How is your understanding of Microsoft licensing?"
 Well, it's been sitting here for 10 or so minutes blinking at me. That's it, no reply, no nothing, not even an "I'm busy" error. It's like "That's it, I'm out".
 Microsoft; licensing so complex that AI can't even understand it. It got a snicker out of the rest of the office.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a small mobile IOS router/switch device that is used for traveling clients. Essentially just a single site-to-site vpn back to an ASA, with a built in switch module. There is a single WAN interface where the crypto map is applied. This interface is public facing and is designed to be plugged into any commercially available IP (hotel, i.e. airport hotspot, etc) 
 We’re debating whats the better security practice on setting up controls on the WAN interface to only allow the IPSEC and ISAKMP traffic in. Is there any advantage or better practice to using ZBF on that port than just a simple inbound ACL that allows only those protocols though? Seems like the same end state from a security stand point

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I initially had the whole story outlined, but I don't think it's necessary as I know this happens to all of us. What do y'all think is the best way to handle such situations?
  
Karen clients: User thinks they know what they are doing, messes up, then calls IT. I offer solutions and the less practical one is declined in favor of the more expensive/complicated one. Then they call my boss/co-worker/etc., who gives them the exact same [simpler] solution, which they take, and claim I never offered it.
 Agent 99 situation: My boss/co-worker/etc. already knew of the situation and my solution. Then they offer the exact same thing as if it was their idea.
  
EDIT (FEB-28-23): The most common and upvoted suggestion seems to be document, document, document. At this point I don't know how much is paranoia and how much is reality. We are down to 40% staff and it's either document or let things go. This particular situation is a wireless network with lots of environmental, feeder controls and alarms for live animal experiments. The person who put it in place was fired and the documentation is all out of wack. At the same time that the Karen client is adding/moving things in the network without consulting. Literally 0 minutes to sit down and Document everything in the ticket, as it flows so quickly and the karen does not read them (and once claimed IT almost killed their experiments)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a small segment of our network, so this is really just one of the VLANs. We have about 70 houses (and a business office, and a school, and ...) that share a single internet connection. All the VDSL modems connect and work well. They can talk to the router, 172.23.72.1 and to devices on the other VLANs (172.23.68.10 for example). However, they cannot talk to each other and I'm baffled.
 The DSLAM is a Huwai MA5600/MA5800 with 4 VDSL cards. Transparent VLAN setup in the DSLAM. Everything gets an IP address fine. Each DSL modem has a "public, but private" IP from our internal network and then does NAT for devices in that house.
 DSL A cannot talk to DSL B. I'd like to be able to put a server/NAS behind A and access it from B. Presently, if I have a server behind A I can only access it from other VLANs on the network or devices not connected to the DSLAM.
 Anyone have any ideas what I'm missing?

These two PCs would benefit from faster lan as they both work with the same data stored on one of those PC. The question is - can I add 10Gbps lan card to both and connect it directly without switch, while keeping the connected by 1Gbps switch? Or would this double connection intrferee? I don't need faster connection to the rest of the network. I'm on tight budget, I was thinking about buying something like zyxel XGN100F (~150USD each) to both PC and premade optical cable (~20USD). Switch with two SFP ports would add ~180 USD that i would like to spare. Thanks!

We would like to get owners/managers to start taking on this responsibility. Because these lists are on-prem, and devices are in Azure, there’s not much users can do to manage these lists. I’m curious as to how you handle this on your end. I was thinking about possibly migrating these groups into Azure, but not too sure on any repercussions of that change. I also thought about a 3rd party tool, but it may not be worth it, if there is something I can do with what I already have. Appreciate any thoughts or comments you may have. Thanks.

 I think he is a major **** for doing this so often. I want to keep my Friday afternoon free to tidy up loose ends, schedule my diary for the next week, etc. NOT to start something new. I want to finish at 5 to spend time with my kids, have a beer and relax. 
 He does not have family and lives alone so I think he doesn't have much of a life outside work. 
 Any ideas how to approach? An invite just landed in my diary for 16.00 this Friday. I'm feeling very annoyed and don't want to attend, but what excuse to use!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 i wrote a thread some weeks ago about performance issues on our RDS farm. I did some more monitoring and saw that the cpu queue is sometimes a bit to high (about 5 - 10 for a 16 core VM).
 So i like to spread the user over more servers and read about the sizing guide from microsoft. Our users working with the office programs, ERP System and doing normal surfing and research via MS Edge and Google Chrome. Due to this workload i would say that its categorized in the heavy work load / power users.
 For that Microsoft says i should use 4 vCPU and about 8 GB RAM per User. Thats beeing said for our about 140 User, i shoud have about 144 vCPUs and 1 TB RAM. Thats seems quite high for me. Usally i dont provision 1:1 CPU ratio. 
 Microsoft also say, i should not provision more then 2 users per vCPU. Thats still 72 vCPUs for all. Due to the workload i dont get a good ratio about real threats and vCPU (on Hyper-V). 
 I'm quite curios about other RDS farms with about the same workload. I read some threats on the internet where 20 Users are on a quad core system with 16 GB RAM. Other wrote that they have 8 Core, 32 GB RAM but just provision it to 4 users. Its quite hard to see the real workload on other infrastructures. 
 So, could some people tell about their sizing in situation there the users doing a simiar workload?
 Thanks

 Let's say an IT administrator accidentally back-ups a 5 TB VM with Data Lock enabled. (which should not be backed-up at all) We would than have to pay for the storage consumption for this VM the entire year? There is no work-around to overcome this? 
 I know this is the purpose of immutable back-ups, but cost is also a big factor when using cloud back-up solutions like Druva.

 We have a client coming on board for support and would like a VPN. Normally we'd configure an SSTP VPN but in this case port 443 is already being routed to their webserver from the internet.
 If I forward another public port (say 414 as an example) to 443 private and point to the VPN server, would this work?
 I'd wager the connection address on SSTP client on other connecting windows endpoints would be vpn.CERTNAMEHERE.co.uk:414?
 Can you poke holes in that theory or point me towards a better solution?
 Besides another static IP that is referenced on the DNS entry to get to the WAN IP I'm struggling to come up with ideas.
 TIA!

 I am new in a company and have noticed that the Windows firewall is deactivated on almost 3000 servers. The reason: The effort to configure the firewall is too great or the Windows firewall would be pointless anyway. I would now like to change this situation and gradually activate the firewall on all servers. The problem is also that the necessary IPs and ports are hardly or not at all documented.
 ​
 Now my question: How would you proceed to achieve this goal? Simply switching on the firewall would instantaneously paralyse most servers. Firewall
 My idea would be: First document the active connections with netstat and write corresponding rules, then activate the firewall with Allow-Any for a certain time and then study the log to find more IPs and ports.
 ​
 I am curious about your suggestions and thank you in advance for your ideas.

 I am having an issue in our enviroment which i can't crack yet. 
 We migrated to M365, and let people work on their workstation. We offer some apps (including M365) as remote apps through RDS. We use Windows Server 2012 R2 (yea yea i know, we are upgrading asap)
 For the people saying, why don't use the local M365 apps. Our back-office system only works good on TS-systems and needs Outlook and word for some functionality. 
 The issue is, when people open attachement in this outlook app or from our back-office system. The outlook 'home' page (The page with inbox and all your e-mail) stays as the focused the screen. The openend attachement or e-mail from our back-office system stays behind that outlook screen until you open it from the taskbar. 
 I am getting the feeling it is an Server 2012 R2 issue or a remote app issue. When we used RDS with desktop for our users, they didn't have this issue but we used Office 2010 then and Exchange 2013.
 Thanks in advance,
 Kind regards,
 Roy de Jonge
 p.s. English is not my primary language, i am sorry for any mistakes in spelling or grammar.

 My example is:
 I have a group policy object assigned to an OU named Site1.
 With 2 GPO's applied, which apply the same setting, on one the setting is Enabled, the other the setting is Disabled. One GPO is named PolicyObject1 and the other is PolicyObject2.
 PolicyObject1 has a link order of 1, PolicyObject2has a link order of 2.
 PolicyObject1 will be applied first, then PolicyObject2 will be applied, overwriting PolicyObject1.
 Am I correct, and if so, please can you provide some Microsoft Documentation regarding this? I'm fairly sure this is right, but I need the documentation to prove it. Thanks :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was tough to come up with a title to sum up what I'm talking about but here are the details:
 We've got half a dozen offices and we are in the process of changing the WAN vlan at each one. Here's a very simplified diagram of one site with a made up subnet:
 https://i.imgur.com/lIDZX3R.png
 Like I said, this is a very simplified diagram but the part in question is accurate. I used the green arrows to show how traffic is flowing from outside to the local LAN. During this change I've got a constant ping going to a host inside the local network from another location across the MPLS.
 The process is:
  
I ssh into the WAN switch from outside (MPLS)
 Select all 4 interfaces at once
 issue the access vlan command
  
At this point I lose anywhere between 5 and 10 pings and then the connection comes back up. Now, I'm reasonably certain that the lost pings are caused by something to do with the MAC address table on the switch but I'm not 100% and I'd really like to understand specifically what causes the brief disconnect. I started labbing this up in GNS3 but I quickly realized that the switch emulation isn't good enough to accurately simulate this scenario.
 If this isn't enough detail I'm happy to provide more in order to help identify what's happening.

I found a way to force a setting change for members, whether they are subscribers or not, but nothing is stopping them from manually changing this setting gain the future. 
 Get-UnifiedGroupLinks $Group -LinkType Member | % {Add-UnifiedGroupLinks -Identity $Group -LinkType subscriber -Links $_.Guid.toString() -Confirm:$false}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /networking! 
 I've been fighting the classic "no internet" globe at our primary location for 2 years. It seems to rear it's ugly head every 6-10 months and of course this Monday was a classic explosion of multiple computers not allowing Outlook to function even though the internet was connected. I've spent hours...nay days on this. 
 Our standard fix has been:
  
`sfc /scannow` `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth` [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet] EnableActiveProbing set to 1 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] NoActiveProbe set to 0 `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator] DisablePassivePolling set to 1 restart computer 
  
I finally realized that an nslookup with "server 131.107.255.255" to any request fails...pcap shows no response from the server what-so-ever. Confirmed the traffic is being passed by the firewall and no clear blocks from anti-virus. 
 I can do a DNS request all day from other networks and IPs. I have access to a number of sites and all of them respond instantly to a dns query to the classic nds.msftncsi.com IP. Any recommendations on how to find out if MS is blacklisting my primary site IP? Who/how do I contact Microsoft regarding this?
 The above fixes have worked previously but of course today, something has changed and 3 computers continue to not function even after the fixes. I do not have IPv6 running on this network. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks for any rabbit holes I may not have run down. This has me frustrated and stumped. I think the fact that DNS isn't responding is my smoking gun but I don't know how to take it to the next level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My fellow Redditors,
 I am redistributing BGP from my router into an OSPF process located in a VRF (Area 1). My router is connected to the Neighbor Router via Area 1. Area 1 is configured as a stub area. 
 My understanding of a stub area is that it blocks Type 5 LSAs. I am redistributing into the OSPF process that includes the stub area. Since my path would be BGP -> OSPF (Backbone Area 0) -> OSPF Area 1 (VRF) -> Neighbor Router (Area 1), does the Stub router located in OSPF Area 1 deny the Type 5 LSA coming via the Backbone area? 
 My understanding is that a Stub Area does not allow an ASBR to exist within it. My router that is redistributing BGP -> OSPF would be considered an ASBR. However, since I'm going from OSPF Area 0 to OSPF Area 1 in a VRF, does the VRF act as an ABR (and not an ASBR) thereby allowing the Stub area to receive the type 5 LSA?
 I understand the simple solution is to configure the Neighbor Router as a NSSA. However, this may not be a possibility. 
 Am I overthinking this? It is as simple as I am coming from BGP -> OSPF and the Stub Area prevents that type 5 LSA from entering it (VRF or not)?

This is due to the proprietary pinout of APC Smart-UPS serial cables.
  
Today I needed a USB to serial cable for a switch's console. That switch is on the other side of a huge building, so I wanted to test it before making the trek. I had found an old radioshack usb-serial adapter and plugged it into an inventory laptop, installed putty and went to the rack to look for a serial port to test it on. Ah ha! Look right here, an unused one on this UPS. Let us see... what's that beeping... ... why is my phone ri... oh shit... zomg wtf really!?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spearphish attempt came as a fake reply to real e-mail that was several years old, from a vendor that had an email compromise.
 The attachment is a password protected zip with the password in message body and something about being unable to send the attachment otherwise (very true in this case).
 Extracted first payload contains large .htm which uses HTML smuggling to drop a second zip file with same password while putting up fake Office 365 page telling you how to open it.
 Second payload contains an .img file which mounts a filesystem and includes a .lnk shortcut to unleash the nastiness.
 From here everything is deeply obfuscated and resistant to being run in a sandbox. Proceeding any farther would require downloading payload files from the Internet and alerting the sender so this is where I stop for now. Even posting the filenames they use could leak information. I will say that the payload files all date from June to November 2021.
 The whole thing closely matches the technique described here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/
 So that's fun.

        <updated>2023-02-27T20:09:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been working on a project that involves taking the existing network of 192.168.1.0, splitting it up into VLANs and creating additional VLANs to allow for a Data Network and Voice Network. I have a Layer 3 core switch which is connected to an ASA and all of the VLANs are configured on the core switch. I implemented the design this weekend and am having trouble with the connections from the new VLANs to the pre-existing network.
 My configuration is as follows:
 ASA
 int g1/1 - Outside
 int g1/2 - Inside - 192.168.1.1 (Connected to Core Switch)
 route inside 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route inside 192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
 route from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.2 is directly connected via g1/2 
 Core Switch
 vtp mode server
 int g1/0/1 (Connected to ASA)
 switchport access to vlan 10
 int vlan 10
 ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 80
 ip add 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30
 int vlan 90
 ip add 192.168.102.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.30 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 
 ip routing is enabled 
 So here's what I've found so far:
 I can ping from 192.168.1.x to any other VLAN
 I can't ping the other way around
 DHCP is working. I'm able to receive all DHCP information and can reach the internet.
 I can ping all SVIs and ASA from 192.168.101.x
 I can't ping between 192.168.101.x and 192.168.102.x networks 
 There are ACLs applied to the inside interface on the ASA, but they appear to permit all icmp traffic and all ip traffic.
 I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this exact issue as searching on Google has been no help. I mostly get results with configurations that involve using the ASA for Inter-VLAN networking, using sub-interfaces and whatnot. I am strictly trying to setup Inter-VLAN networking on the L3 switch. Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have this guy that works... "works"... with us and we've noticed an increase in the frequency that we see Netflix up on his computer, through his browser. Now, we don't have a problem with someone pulling up Netflix while they work for background noise, if it helps them get the work done more efficiently, I myself have YouTube videos up while I'm working, it helps me concentrate and get my work done, and my boss doesn't have a problem with it. The major issue is that this guy doesn't really do anything, just sits on Yahoo! all day and watches Netflix. So we were thinking, we should block Netflix on his computer. The only problem is, Netflix has thousands of IP addresses, and trying to block, or redirect, based on IP would take a long time, time that we don't really have.
 So my question is this... does anyone know of an effective way to block Netflix on a domain computer, and only that domain computer? Blocking the site on the network completely is not an option, based on the nature of our work environment, so we need it to be just for one computer. We also do not want him to know that we actively blocked it, he has a bad temper and flies off the handle when things like this are brought up, and retaliation is a real fear, so a redirect to localhost is preferred. If it's not possible, I get it, but we need him to not be on Netflix all day.
 NOTE: 1.) My boss can't fire him, he's been trying. 2.) He's tried talking to him about things like this before, it doesn't work. 3.) HR has been ineffective at helping the situation, their advice as "All you can do is talk to him."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up a complex system using a cisco nexus with full routing enabled. I need to have two VRFs set up for regulations requirements. I need to get 4 networks on the switch run through 2 vrfs out two physical interfaces up to the firewall where Policy can handle it and let things go out to the internet. I am having trouble actually configuring it.
 The basic set up is kind of like this: 
 VR-Office
 vlan 12
 10.10.12.0/22
 10.10.12.1 gateway 
 vlan 16
 10.10.16.0/24
 10.10.16.1 gateway
 int eth1/1 ip add 172.16.16.129 #the far end will have an add of 16.130 
 VR-Accounting
 vlan 112
 10.20.12.0/22
 10.20.12.1 gateway 
 vlan116
 10.20.16.0/24
 10.20.16.1 gateway
 int eth1/2 ip add 172.16.16.133 #other side will have address 16.134 
 I need the two vlans to have an svi per vlan that I can add to the associated VRFs. Then I need to route to physical interfaces associated to the vrfs.
 The way I logically manage it in my head I imagine that the office vrf has two SVIs, one per vlan, with each having the IP address of the vlans gateway. Then the office vrf also has the physical interface. 
 I want to make sure that the vlans 12 and 16 are only routing on vrf vr-office and can be routed our eth1/1 to get out. 
 Am I misunderstanding anything? Would anyone be willing to explain how this might look in a L2/L3 router's config? I feel like I am missing something simple.

TLS certificates require domain names to work so DNS over TLS only works if you provide a hostname instead of an IP address, but if the device is connecting to a network for the first time and the DHCP server only provides the hostnames for the DNS servers then how is the device going to resolve the hostname to connect to the DNS server in the first place? Also, what if I'm connected to a single DNS server that supports DoT and the cached IP address disappears or something? How are these situations handled? And if you just cannot resolve any query then are you supposed to provide the IP address of the server as a fallback option? What is the best way to proceed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as the title says I believe that the company has lost all their data. There was a storm overnight that turned the power off for a while and when everyone came in this morning computers turned on like normal except the "server" (Win10 machine with all shared files on it). Basically the machine would not boot windows. Plugged the SSD into another computer and saw the data was RAW instead of NTFS. I have to format the drive in order to use the SSD again. They had 2 external drives plugged into the computer for backing up but apparently the last time anything was done on the drives was back in 2020 and there weren't even any backups. Is there anyway to recover the SSD without formatting or is it a total loss? The company does not have IT, they call us whenever there's an issue and we offered to do cloud backups a while back but they're cheap and refused saying they'd do it on their own.
 Update: the computer was windows 10 but they were running server 2019 on Hyper V. SSD has Been sent to data recovery center

The issue is that the main switch (Ubiquity) only allows mirroring of one port. This would be fine, except that I have redundant firewalls, with automatic fail over. The second FW is connected to another port on the switch.
 My thought was to put a HUB between the firewalls and the main switch, then plug the monitor into that.

 set interfaces ae8 native-vlan-id 1 set interfaces ae6 unit 0 family ethernet-switching native-vlan-id default 
 After doing some reading, I think it's just the difference in setting that actual ae8 interface to native vlan 1, whereas the second command is setting the logical ae6.0 interface to native vlan default which on this switch is also vlan ID 1. So vlan default = vlan 1. Wouldn't each interface act the same with anything on vlan 1?
 The change I am making is swapping po1 and 2 vlans. So I don't know why when I move po1 (which owns the default, or vlan1 traffic) to po2, traffic stops flowing. I feel it has something to do with the above commands.

 ​
 we have been running our GGC for some years now, and it gives a pretty constant 1:3 bandwidth saving. We just got our Akamai appliances and I'm curious how much that will be, probably higher peaks but less consistency. As we don't have private customers directly Netflix has not been interesting for now, but I could see huge savings on networks with many private customers.
 ​
 Which appliances are you running and how much Bandwidth do they save for you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I am about to buy a new laptop, for my job. My job consists of a basic office work, excel, word, outlook and little bit of graphic design, photoshop. In my free time, I like to play games, mostly Dota 2, warzone.
 So I started to look for a laptop, for office work. I found out that if I dont want the lowest tier office laptop, I am gonna pay around 700-800 € (which is my budget). For this price, I can find some lower tier gaming laptops (10- 11th gen intel, rtx 3050, 144 Hz displays which I find very comfortable to work with). 
 Thats where my dilemma starts, would you rather buy a mid tier office laptop, but not have the ability to use it for entertainment, or aim for lower tier gaming laptop which may have some disadvatages ( overheating, weight, noise)? 
 My best options I found on the web so far:
 Office laptops: DELL Latitude 15-3520, ASUS Vivobook 15X OLED X1503ZA-MA437W,
 Gaming laptops: MSI GF63 Thin 11SC, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IHU6 Shadow Black 
 All of these are approximately 800€ (you can suggest different). Besides that, I am have a desktop PC at home, mid tier gaming machine, but sometimes I work from outside my home. I dont have any laptop right now.
 Thank you your replies, I appreciate all of the advices and shared experiences.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a major power event at our main data center yesterday. Maintenance was being performed on our UPS, something went wrong and we lost all power to all of the racks including our production Nutanix cluster (5 hosts, ~120 running VMs) and our main backup repository (Dell Data Domain). I was shocked when we powered everything back up and there wasn't a single data corruption issue (that we have found). In hindsight, I know I should have shut everything down gracefully ahead of time but they assurred me it was routine thing that they do all the time and it wouldn't cause any issues. That should have been the red flag.
 The point of my story is....we've come a long way in recent years in terms of preventing data corruption. I remember a time when pulling the power on a SQL Server while running would almost certainly mean recovering databases from a backup. Chalk one up for progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning fellow nerds and geeks,
 I need some advice on my career trajectory. I've been working for a company for 10 years and I recently moved into a management slot overseeing our department. It's a small shop, but a really good company and I was really enjoying it.
 Fast forward to a few weeks back, and we were bought out. It's looking like I'm going to be back in a sys admin position. While it's not terrible considering I have the same wage, seniority, and WFH, I'm concerned it'll hurt me moving back into a management slot. I'm concerned that the longer I'm out of the position, the harder it'll be to move back up.
 What is your experience with this? Is my concern unfounded, or should I start looking again? We've not moved over to the new company just yet, but it looks like there's no management slots available and likely won't be for some time. The current staff have all been there for a long time and don't look to be moving on anytime soon.

What I want to do is make a inventory system which can be accessed from each of those store locations using a barcode system with a barcode reader and a inventory software. 
 Simply my goal with this software is to see: - Quantity of a certain product by location - the sizes available of the product
 I dont need the software to be linked with the cash register.
 For example if a product is sold. I want to scan the barcode and decrease the quantity of how many of the products is left.
 Or the exact opposite. When new products arrive i want to print a barcode and stick it on the product and then enter it into the inventory system.
 I understand that for this i will need
  
multiple barcode scanners
 barcode printer
  
Have you guys ever worked with this type of software and also which software is the best and cheapest for this system.

 I work for a mid-sized company of about 160 users.
 We're currently looking for a secure web gateway kind of product. We previously ran a POC of Netskope, but this didn't turn out very well for us. We've looked at other solutions such as Zscaler, Perimeter81 and Cloudflare One, but I'm curious to know what others have used in this space and how effective those products have been.
 The main things we are looking for are:
  
Filtering traffic(DNS, HTTP, Network based, etc..)
 Can provide some kind of secure access to non-public facing web apps.
 Has some kind of Malware filter for web traffic.
 Detects shadow IT usage. - Defender for cloud apps does some of this, but doesn't seem super robust.
  
Thanks everyone.

 Blacklist monitoring and alerting, SPF, DNS, DKIM and DMARC Checks (+RUF) and so on.
 But as mxtools, dmarcly and so on are from outside of Europe, my company isn't keen to buy non-GDPR compliant services ( and our procurement apparently doesn't want to get into international payments...). 
 Long story short - my research wasn't really successful, so here's my question to you: Are you aware of any such email security service hosted in Europe?

As far as I can tell, Nautobot doesn't cater for WDM usage on a fibre path.
 So 2 questions.. is there a way to make it work in Nautobot? If not, what are you using to record and document your WDM deployments and what do you like and dislike about it?

 My team has recently expanded from a couple of people to a much larger group. We now need to securely store some passwords and logons that the team collectively need, eg for accessing administration websites. I am looking for a suitable piece of software (Win Server) or website that would allow us to store these securely and ensure access for the team, while allowing us to grant / restrict access to specific individuals. Ideally this would be cheap, or free, as we are education/public sector.

 On the github page OP said to change values one has to go to
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin 
 But after installing the app, that key does not appear in that path (or any other path), so do I have to create it manually?
 I also wrote some PS code to create the key if its not there with my veeery limited PS syntax knowledge and some AI, but it also doesnt seem to work. While it does install the app (if its in the same directory as the script for now), it does not create the key.
 $software = "MakeMeAdmin 2.3.0 x64.msi" $msiPath = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot $software if (Test-Path $msiPath) { Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList "/i `"$msiPath`" /quiet /passive" if (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ProductFilter -Filter "Name='$software'") { Write-Output "'$software' is installed." # Create the MakeMeAdmin key if it does not exist if (!(Test-Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin")) { New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\" -Name "MakeMeAdmin" -Force | Out-Null } # Set the AdminRightTimeout value to 60 minutes New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\MakeMeAdmin" -Name "AdminRightTimeout" -Value "60" -PropertyType DWORD -Force } else { Write-Output "'$software' NOT installed." } } else { Write-Output "MSI package '$software' not found." } 
 Sorry if the post sounds confusing, I am lost myself rn haha

 Please bare with me as my windows admin experience is nonexistent. At the corp. I work for, they are largely a windows shop and while they have been generous to provide admin rights on developer machine. Basically their development process is very manual and limited automation.
 So trying to get automation in is rather challenging due to the firewall. EG: I cannot use terraform as trying to use it from the terminal fails due to the proxy settings. Similar for minikube or pulling from the docker hub. In December there was some screw up because I could actually pull docker containers from hub.docker.com. When speaking to the infosec people they keep telling me we need static IP's so that they can allow those sites. However trying to find out who can assign static IP's just results in the run around. 
 Surely there is a way with windows group policies to allow developers in that policy to get access to terraform/npm/docker?
 I think the firewall solution is from fortinet if that helps with suggestions.

 Many thanks

 we are using a Slack-App to do our permission management. The user fils a short form, a superior and myself accept the form & then I set the permissions manually on our Domain Controller (which is a Synology NAS). 
 So now I want to get this automated. The goal would be to only hit the "accept" button in the slack-app and the permission for the user get set automatically and also get removed after a set date.
 I don't really know how to do this technically.
 Maybe you have an idea or direction on how to achieve this, so I can do some further research. :)

Our customer has access to Alcatel-Lucent switches with a significant discount. My last experiences with Alcatel were not the best, with them being tedious and slow to configure, but that was about 12 years ago. We primarily use Cisco and Dell for core and access switches these days and I am currently thinking about sticking to what we know best or just going with Alcatel to save money. We are planing to use stacked 48 Port 1G PoE Switches as access switches and 48 Port 25G switches witch MLAG as core switches.
 What are your thoughts and experiences with Alcatel?
 Features that are important for us (apart from stability and support of course):
  
configuration through a CLI interface which can be automated with ansible
 stacking for access switches, MLAG for core switches
 a solid 802.1X implementation with multi-host support

 I'm preparing to setup Linux VM deployment for our application team, the goal is to setup a basic VM via template and then deploy the OS and all standard configurations automatically.
 The distros will vary, depending on the requirements, but overall they will deploy Ubuntu (22.04 or 20.04) and RHEL (probably 9, maybe 8).
 For lifecycle management like updates and config changes we will probably be using Ansible, but how could I automate the deployment process across those distributions?
 I am aware of kickstart, but afaik this is a Fedora/RHEL based tool, would it be possible to deploy Ubuntu as well?
 I'm asking this, because Ubuntu has it's own deployment tools, if I get this right, which is Autoinstall/Cloud-Init, and I would prefer to use only one method for both distros.
 What would be the best approach to this, otherwise?
 I'm sorry if something seems unclear, I'm pretty new to linux administration (dipping into it right now)
 All answers appreciated!

 I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, if it's not I'll remove my post.
 My boss asked me to remove all local admin users from the domain. Doesn't seem too hard so that's going to be easy. The hard part is supporting the users which have the local admin accounts.
 Some users need to change their IPv4-Address to work with servers. I fixed this with the local group Windows 10 has which is called "Network Configuration Operators". All users which need to change their IPv4 Address are automatically added in this Group via a Group Policy.
 Now I wanted to know if I can do the same thing with allowing users to create bootable USB-Drives and give them the permission to partition USB-Disk Partitions. 
 I checked the builtin Windows 10 groups but didn't find a group which could enable this. Maybe someone can help me with this?
 Thanks in advance!

 Any tips on designing them in P-Touch editor and getting the alignment to keep when transferring them to the labeler templates for use on the device? We can use the software or the app, but it's so nice when it does work that you can just enter in a pre-set field or two and it prints the same everytime.
 For a simple two line label, with two "titles" the alignment never lines up.
 I know some of you guys use p-touch so thought I'd ask before I pull my hair out over a darn labeler.

 Would using Defender + Huntress ( Managed Cybersecurity Platform for SMBs and IT Providers | Huntress ) be a good replacement?

 Just about any routing feature I’d need is present, not to mention the performance is pretty impressive.
 One of the things I don’t see in FRR’s documentation, and this was confirmed by some of the FRR devs as well, is there’s no Netflow/IPFIX/Sflow capabilities.
 Obviously FRR is intended to be a routing suite, and that’s understandable, but has anyone here using FRR found a library for this purpose on Debian that is actively maintained and has enough flexibility to be considered viable for being used alongside FRR?

 Just curious on how everyone running older equipment…or Cat9200s…supporting auto-install mode are doing ZTP with DHCP. Specially in regards to DHCP scopes where native VLANs don’t exist.
 At all of our locations everything is tagged and a defunct/unused native VLAN is used.
 And idea I had was to create a small network just for the ZTP configuration on the branch router and then just abandon it afterwards.
 Curious how everyone else does it?

This site was quite helpful, but I discovered that I had a hard time coming up with fake users, fake documents, and the like to make it actually look like an internal company network that was in use.
 Whilst doing this, I thought to ask ChatGPT for some help on the matter, and the results were quite helpful. I gave the prompt:
  
I'm trying to learn how to become a sys-admin, in order to do this I'm creating a homelab in VMware, I want this homelab to be a realistic simulation of an SMB, please generate some fake, but reasonable information about this fictional SMB that I'm emulating for training purposes. 
  
It gave me some excellent data that would likely take me forever to think of on my own. It included names of employees, their good/bad passwords, company details like location and size, it even gave me data about the technology they used!
 I've seen people use ChatGPT for writing scripts or fixing problems, but with dubious accuracy. Alot of the solutions are good, but it seems about half of them contain some manner of issues and inaccuracies. However, it seems that ChatGPT's excellence in making up BS can actually be used for good!
 EDIT: Let it be known that ChatGPT's accuracy is sometimes a bit better than half, but in all fairness I wouldn't trust it enough to justify some peoples uses for it. Although generating reasonable, but fake information seems to have a 100% chance of working.

We were a necessary evil but IT wasn't something that the company liked to spend money on. We were running on shoestring budgets and poor leadership. We were expected to move mountains and were in constant fire fighter mode. 
 The new organization is much more mature and more resourced. The IT team appears to be at least 10 times the size of the previous company. Everything is organized, automated and cutting edge. There are clear expectations and IT appears to be highly regarded by the leadership team. 
 My initial reaction was feeling like there is nothing for me to do at the new company since there aren't any burning fires to put out but I realized that this new environment and change in culture offers me time to actually grow. I can actually focus and learn new things rather than run from one problem to another. 
 Just wondering how others have gone through this experience. My hope is that I will be able to really level up in the new role.

 Anyone year who’s been working for 10+ years and still enjoys it? Do you still like learning about new stuff and working on a homelab and what not?
 It’s also weird cause so many of those folks that work non-tech jobs like farming end up wanting to learn to code and switch to a desk job after 10 years.

 I have a fluke toner but found that the 48v on the surrounding live lines generates to much noise to be usable ☹️

 (This is for prepping cable for fusion splicing).
 They both appear to be 3-hole fiber optic strippers, and from the specs I can see, they strip the same diameters.
 Is one newer or older than the other?
 Does anybody have any personal preferences, with any reasons between these?
 (I saw Knipex also makes some fiber optic strippers - Knipex 12 82 130 SB and Knipex 12 85 110 SB, however, there don't seem to be many reviews for them, and I assume they're not as well known as the Miller gear)

 I was wondering if anyone had advice for software for scanning a network for live devices.
 I currently use advanced IP scanner but it doesn’t placate pull through users. The company I work for is actively trying to reduce our electricity by having users power down on a Friday. It’s not happening though as on Monday mornings they don’t like waiting, when I run advanced up scanner it tells me machine names etc but not always the users. 
 Sadly My predecessors didn’t keep note of machine names and who they went to so it would take ages to sit and go through things.

We currently uses a very heavily Customized version of Dynamic AX and we'd like to upgrade to a new ERP system that replicates as much of this as possible so we don't have to maintain and import all of our customizations.
 A lot of emphasis on the features and input process for Sales Orders to make it easy to input with huge numbers of size/color/fabric and customization variations.
 And also to manage the many stages that are involved in creating the custom apparel for the people involved in actually producing them at each stage.
 We also have a lot of custom reports, so it would be great to have a good BI system, separate data warehouse so that running reports doesn't affect performance of the main system.
 We are about 300 employees and growing.

 I am looking to a easy to use alternative that is hopefully open source, but my search results are all turning up kaput. I see a lot of talk about group policies and temporary accounts. I'm not too verse on those. Right now the lab is set up as 32 bare metal computers with an admin and a student account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So recently I was asking a question about how to fix Grub if I'm installing Windows after Ubuntu. I found the solution. But now I want to ask about aftermaths of boot-repair. So, my system was working like this before:
  
Ubuntu with Grub
 Windows on hdd
  
So what I did is I unplugged every drive, I installed Windows on new m2 ssd, connected old hdd (where my old windows was located), transfered all data and formatted hdd so it's now just a storage for windows. Then I connected ssd with my ubuntu and run boot-repair from my usb flash. After that grub got fixed and I can choose between new Windows and Ubuntu, and it's all working.
 But one thing that bothers me is that there's still old Windows left on grub menu, even tho I formatted old hdd with Windows. Also in UEFI there were added more options to boot from, like ubuntu (m2 ssd) and ubuntu (hdd) even tho ubuntu is not installed there at all. I have the logs from boot-repair saved, if they're safe to share, I can share them. Also I can screenshot my partitions if it's needed, just tell me what to run, I'm not a pro in such things, and it seems like no-one in other communties can help me (I asked this question many times), so please don't delete the question, because last time I asked here something, it got deleted even tho it didn't violate any rules, but I was lucky enough to get the answer before it got deleted, so I came here again, as my last hope, not trying to violate anything.
 My question is, should I be worried about something? Or it's not of a big deal and I can forget about it? It also says when I'm booting to Ubuntu "failed to set APST feature" and something starts going on, and eventually it loads after a little time and works fine, new Windows on m2 ssd works fine too.

 When transfering file internally inside smb server getting 120 - 130 MB transfer speed beetwen two hard drive.
 My concern is how can i achieve atleast 120MB file transfer speed from laptop to smb server.
 What speed i can get highest? Over wifi and over ethernet?
 Update:
 Router is Tenda AC15 AC1900 802.11ac
 From feature: ac speed of up to 1900Mbps, delivering both 1300Mbps 802.11ac at 5GHz and 600Mbps 802.11n at 2.4 GHz concurrently.
 And laptop wifi 6 supported.
 Smb server connected with usb3 ethernet adapter with router utp cable gigabit port.
 Tried from smb server main hard disk without external harddrive still getting 30- 35 MB speed.
 If connect from android connection speed showing 866Mbps (not file transfer speed)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a recent networking grad working for a big bank. I remember as a student delving into automation, everything was new and interesting. I had a lot of fun setting up small topologies in GNS3 and automating commands with Ansible and Nornir.
 Now that I’ve started my career, I’m very interested (from a selfish point of view but also as a way to increase my skills) in taking my automation skills to the next level.
 I’m under no illusions that throwing Python scripts to automate some config changes does not make me some automation wizard. Anyone with a keen interest in learning automation can get to that point in no time at all.
 With that being said, I’d really appreciate some seasoned automation people to share cool ideas they’ve implemented. 
 I was thinking of looking into how to create a web GUI that takes in a command and runs them against some specified devices. But then I think Ansible Tower is pretty similar to that, so I don’t think that would be the best return on time for me to create that (bearing in mind it’d take me a long time to learn how to create web GUIs).
 This post was borne out of a desire to understand how to get to the next level. As I’m working for a large enterprise with many networking colleagues, I want to be able to build automation tools that others can use, not just some one-off Python scripts.

 For a week or two I plan to run both concurrently, in a primary/failover scenario, while I make sure everything is solid.
 I've always had IPv6 via DHCP-PD; I know the new ISP provides IPv6 as well (it was able to pull a v6 address), including PD (based on reading).
 I set up the router to grab PD from both WANs, but so far it's only pulling/using the primary ISP.
 I've been looking around, and I see that multi-wan PD is perhaps a common issue... then it occurred to me that perhaps it's not even possible, given that such a configuration would essentially multi-home each host (right?).
 so my question is simple - is it even possible to use DHCPv6-PD from multiple ISPs without using BGP?
 Thanks in advance!

 I work in IT for a company that has in the last few months been plagued by an update that has made it so nearly every computer we own now auto-locks after 2-5 minutes. We have opened up a support ticket with Microsoft and they deny anything is wrong, but other companies have agreed with us that this is new and is affecting them as well.
 To try and bypass this new "feature" we have tried: 
  
rolling back the update - Didn't work
 modifying power plan settings - didn't work 
 Power plan advanced settings - didn't work
 
 Windows settings - didn't work
 Various registry edits - didn't work*
 Disabling Windows Dynamic Lock (this is normally disabled by our policy anyway, but that's a whole other story) - didn't work
 Disabling Dell Optimiser on computers that have it - Didnt work
  
There are no settings in our Azure AD tenant, group policy, or on-prem domain that pertain to screen saver and screen lock timers
 * we did find a registry key that disables the computer's ability to lock entirely (including using Win+L), but this poses a security issue for obvious reasons and so we aren't going this route. 
 So far the only thing I have found was earlier today when I was working on this issue is that my windows screen saver settings auto default back to five minutes even after changing the settings AND modifying the registry key to set the screen saver up to 15 minutes.
 I also found that my computer's screen will lock after 2 minutes but when I boot in safe mode it goes. up to 5. 
 We now have upper management breathing down our necks because everyone is complaining about this issue and the CIO is trying to fend everyone off the best they can while we figure this out but nothing is working.
 Does anybody have ANY ideas because we're at wits end here.

 I have quotes from people from using KVM to VMware, but I can't get funding for a completely new VM system. (Was quoted $45k-150K depending on vendor for 3 host 20 vm load with backup)
 I need to get this as cheap as possible (<$5k) with reliability.
 The demand of the system is very very low. We have probably 80 windows clients that are AD joined, and use the DNS service. It also syncs to Azure and runs google script (I know it should be a PAW, but right now don't have the vm to do this).
 Part of me thinks, okay bare metal, how few times anything has actually failed, it is likely to be fine.
 Throw together a box, install, and go.
 But the gnawing part of me says, do VM. But what part of VM makes sense unless a 2nd host can run it (Azure/AWS for backup?) and the storage is accessable.. (without spending on NAS/SAN, have a removeable raid 1 storage so it can go to another device)?
 Anyone have ideas on the minimal install for a server? Is proxmox or such worthwhile with small workstations that are under 2k each?

 Much of my research around getting started in this field suggests learning an OS in-and-out, a close-second is learning a scripting language. Because I work in a Windows environment, it's sensible to start with Windows and PowerShell. This makes sense, but I don't know how to go about tackling the former. 
 There are some books, like Powershell for SysAdmins, that can teach me Windows administration through PowerShell--hitting two birds with one stone. Is this advisable or should I begin by learning Windows core processes and its other components independently of PowerShell so I don't get overwhelmed?
 I fear I'm overthinking this, and I'd welcome that constructive criticism if that's what's going on. Helping me develop this area of my roadmap would be much appreciated. Thank you!

 They need to be able to send and receive mail on all 3 accounts but only really need to be fully Microsoft licensed on their primary. Currently they have licenses in all 3 and open 3 separate mailboxes in Outlook with various forwarding rules etc set up.
 Ideally it would be much simpler for them to manage with one account and mailbox and just use aliases from the other tenants but I haven’t been able to find any good docs on how to do that or if it’s even possible. Tenants have to stay as separate entities due to the way the companies are silo’d. 
 Looking for recommendations on how to do this simpler/better! Thank you

 Anyway...We’re doing some IT work for a friend and we need to replace an aging PC where Atrium is installed. I’m aware that in addition to the Atrium software itself there’s also a SQL database behind. Not sure if there are other dependencies or not. I have the Atrium software install for the new PC, but what steps are required to get everything transferred and running on the new PC while retaining all existing settings\access and of course not “breaking” anything.
 I was thinking the steps would be something like this. Or am I way off base here?
  
Backup existing SQL database
 Install Atrium software on new PC
 Restore database backup on new PC.
  
Thanks in advance if anyone has any experience doing this.

Instead of using our software imaging (Quest KACE) to save a bit of time I showed our desktop techs that they can simply put in the Windows 10 Enterprise key from our software licensing (we have an enterprise agreement) which saves the time on having to re image. They like the idea of saving time but also liked that the image answered the Windows installation questions from the Unattend.xml file I built within KACE scripted installations (we want to move away from KACE K2000 and don't have SCCM).
 What I want to know is if it is possible to put an answer file of any sort into one of these new Dell machines to answer all the basics and setup a simple admin user so they can then get on the domain right away and start working.
 I have tried pulling the command prompt at OOBE load (Shift + F10) and have thrown an Unattend.xml file in both the C:\Windows\Panther and C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep folders but nothing happened as I had hoped.
 Any ideas? I hope this is clear enough, please ask any questions for clarification.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perfect way to ruin your weekend. I took this job 5 months ago as internal IT guy. Came into a place that has fat clients everywhere with no servers and everything MS365 cloud/onedrive. Passwords are flying around all over the place. And yes, they also used (and still use) Lastpass, which is, as we all know, compromised. When I came there, there were NO BACKUPS. Boss thought they were unnecessary because "everything is taken care of by Microsoft". It took me 2 months to convince him that he was wrong about that. So I did implement a backup system which is running now. Also took care of other stuff and was testing out Intune for consistent MDM deployment.
 Boss was also global admin himself and fucks around with permissions and settings, causing problems that I don't understand because he doesn't tell me what he changed.
 He also has this minion dude that works a couple hours a week and barely knows how to install a computer.
 So yesterday I get called in and get this 3 page letter stating that I'm doing everything wrong, got my priorities wrong, I meddle in things that I should not meddle in, I'm watching Netflix at work on my laptop, which is a complete lie, and I'm not following orders. I'm not 21, I'm 52 with a ton of experience who's jaw dropped when he said that he didn't need any backups.
 So at the end of the talk, he says he withdraws my admin rights. So now I can't do anything. "Sure you can, just pick out the roles that you need". The little minion still retains rights.
 The little minion also says that I did not share the backup account password with him. I did. He looked in the wrong column of the spreadsheet.
 What the hell should I do?

 i have installed Oracle Linux 9.1 and then FreeRADIUS, added both the WLC and APs as clients, used a test user but no dice, when adding a windows machine as a client and test with NTRadPing i get accepted message, but when connecting to the AP nothing happens.
 on both FreeRADIUS and WLC the config is up to cisco documentation, but there is no communication between the two. i am sure i am missing something stupid but i cant put my finger on it.
 any help is appreciated because i am starting to feel really stupid for failing such a basic task.

 So I'm still not very well documented regarding SCCM handling. I'm trying to create a simple recurring Maintenance Window for each software group, so it happens exactly the third weekend of the month, or one weekend after MS's patching tuesday. This is to give some leeway week for the patches to be trialed on the test group in the first weekend. Is there a logical way to do so? Because the current setup is to manually input non-recurring MW for each damn month of the year...

 On a related note: I had to work 16 hours today. I’m holed up in a hotel and have to work tomorrow for what I’m suspecting to be another 10ish hours. We’re migrating a bunch of new users. I’ve never felt less like this was for me than I do right now. How is this my job? Meanwhile I have friends who are fully remote and making bank working at their leisure.
 Guess this rant went a bit off the rails. I just don’t know want this to be my life going forward. This wasn’t what I signed up for when I took this job. Wish I could just catch my big break like my friends did.

 I am finishing up a migration from Intermedia (hosted Exchange) to Office 365. I have almost everything set up, but am facing a stumbling block. If you have any idea how to fix it or even another way of doing things, I'd appreciate your advice.
 To preface, our public folders contain mailbox enabled folders that have their own aliases that external users e-mail regularly. Our current setup allows only users assigned a public folders role to have access to see the public folders as its own entity under folders in their Outlook client. No one else sees it. For the migration, we are using BitTitan.
 In Office 365, I set up the public folder and using BitTitan, migrated the stuff over. I set explicit permissions using the public folder GUI in the Exchange admin center. However, everyone is seeing the public folders as if it's a shared mailbox shared with everyone. I've found out how to limit unauthorized users from accessing the content, but the public folder mailbox remains. Any ideas of how to get rid of the mapping entirely for certain users?

It's ranged from a simple UI bug that provides incorrect instruction that would lead to an outage, to a poorly designed and documented system that will lead to a legitimate loss of data. I've heard responses from "voice your concern in the community forum and let people vote on it" to "that's just how it's going to work, it's up to you to deal with possible data loss"
 I don't regret cloud services...I don't want to be thinking about CPU, storage, rackspace, maintenance windows, etc for every application I'm tasked with, but i do think that the exorbitant subscription licensing costs should provide some equal amount of product improvement and support. Maybe I've been huffing too much of the cloud not knowing it's just smoke?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Kinda novice on this, I am building a windows 11 image for rollout. I understand that an "image" is not the most modern way to do it but I'm on a very limited time schedule. My question is about copyprofile in the autounattend.xml file. On Microsoft's website it says that if you use copyprofile you need to delete certain registry entries after the fact using regedit. You need to load it up, open a hive etc. Is there an easy way to accomplish this over command line so it can be automated?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two CBS350 switches stacked and I'm managing it via the OOB port on stack member 1. For redundancy should the second member's OOB also be connected? 
 I've tried to find documentation on this, but it's not in the manual. My concerns are:
 -Will this create a loop? Does STP even work on the OOB int?
 -Does doing this provide the expected solution, where if member 1 fails, the stack can still be managed via the OOB interface on the second member.
 -Would the management IP somehow move to the other OOB int?

What happens is that your eyes may roll and get stuck when they get a glimpse of the captain of your brain for guidance, but he’s having the same problem, and his captain is having the same problem (etc) thus causing a multi dimensional recursive state. Eventually your neural stack overflows.
 But take comfort, your brain will reboot. You will try to reprocess events, but those poor neurons are fried. And don’t bother talking about the problem to anyone; it’s scrap code that will only give more form to a problem that should not exist.
 Don’t complain at all. It isn’t going to add any sense. Just put that little layer 8 object in a box, and push it into the sea of your mind, toward the waters where DNS probably lurks.

 Was wondering if I could get another perspective on this issue that suddenly occurred. It's got me scratching my head as well as a colleague of mine. So, here's the scenario...
 I've got about 20 Adtran Netvantas situated through my network. My admin AD account creds work just fine in all of them. In each switch, there's a local "sadmin" user created that has worked fine up until last night. 
 I was in a new switch last night using "sadmin" getting ready to config RADIUS on it and suddenly my sadmin account failed on me when I had to SSH back in. Strangely enough, I then discovered that the "sadmin" creds failed on all my switches. This account is not an AD account, so that's why it's got us puzzled... 
 service password-encryption
 !
 username "sadmin" password encrypted "2e225c6676944cbfe03d03126a45db4dbeae" 
 Any insight and/or suggestions as to why this suddenly happened across all my switches would be appreciated. TIA folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started a management gig at a K12 school and one of the items on my agenda is to modernise the switching within the school.
 Currently we are mostly Aruba switching with a mix of Cisco switches in nodes around the school. Our core switch is Cisco however most of our major nodes are Aruba.
 So here is the issue; our state govsrment is overhauling our wireless and providing a replacement for every wireless access point and these will ALL be cisco as well as a Cisco WLC. 
 I would like to start using smart monitoring software like Juniper Mist, Cisco DNS or HP Airwave but I am under the assumption that we everything will need to be the same vendor for this to be clean and effective.
 The other issue is that the team im not leading has very limited switching experience and in order to Change that I'd like to get them used to a specific vendors way of doing something first.
 Has anyone got any advice on which vendor to go with for switching? Do I have a problem if I mix switches and want to use the software? Or am I making this a bigger issue than it needs to be.
 So to sum up I am considering: CISCO HP Aruba JUNIPER UBIQUITI 
 NOTE: Assume budget is no issue and we are just aiming for the best possible setup.

 Last year, one project that was on hold was the replacement of the current switchboard for the reception / call center (three people) that is currently running with a very old solution, I'm not going into details but it doesn't do much except receiving calls and displaying all users on a virtual switchboard.
 All other users are on Teams and it's working good for them.
 The problems we currently have is that overall, the switchboard solution doesn't know anything about users on Teams ; it doesn't know if they are on call, away or simply offline.
 About 2 months ago I was approached by a vendor for an integrated solution that basically works "below" teams as a virtual PBX that can tehn route calls to Teams,…]]></summary>

 My main concern is, are we going to have to completely tear down the Fabric site and essentially rebuild each site from scratch? 
 I know in the past we have replaced switches with the same model and that worked fine but I don't see using the "mark for replacement" feature working in this case. 
 Just seeing if anyone has gone through this yet at all. Posted in the cisco community forum a couple weeks ago but no responses yet there either.

 Been in a Network Engineer/Network Admin role for 3+ years. Mostly for smaller scale government networks. I've made it to the final round of interviews for a position as an MPLS engineer.
 I feel confident about some of the things they want, like L2 switching, L3 routing, OSPF/BGP and Cisco familiarity. The problem is that I haven't touched MPLS professionally in a while, and when I did it was on the customer end. The company I'm interviewing with is a provider. Aside from a core understanding of MPLS, I've also been told they're going to want to talk about: Segment Routing, Pseudowire, VRF, VPRN, VPLS, EVPN, 1588, and TWAMP. They've also mentioned the ISIS routing protocol which I'm not too familiar with.
 I understand the theory of MPLS and I've been individually researching these other topics. I was wondering if you guys know any solid video series, courses/labs, or books that would cover most or all of these things under the MPLS umbrella. The interview is next week so my aim is not to sound like a complete clown when I talk about MPLS. Any advice appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 Network for reference: (Edit: I tried to do spacing here but it didnt work. SW1 has SW 2 and 3 below. SW 2 has 4 and 5 below and SW3 has 6 and 7 below)
 SW1
 SW2 SW3
 SW4 SW5 SW6 SW7
 I am currently trying to gain insight in a network and to do that we are installing a sensor on SW1. We then used RSPAN get all traffic from all of the lower switches up to SW1 for the local SPAN. Currently SW6 and SW7 have remote VLAN 111 going to SW3. But once we try forwarding SW3 to SW1 using VLAN 111 it creates a loop and sends a copy back to SW6 and SW7 since the trunk allows the VLAN both ways.
 Any solutions to this issue?
 We are thinking of having RSPAN on SW4, 5, 6 and 7 use VLAN 111 and then configure RSPAN on SW2 and 3 to use VLAN 112 so that way the traffic is only able to go one direction. Not sure if this would work.
 Thanks all!

Today's theft is surprisingly early, so it must have been a boozy lunch. Because of this, I am going to have someone on our junior staff create a training session on how to avoid getting your shit stolen while having a drinking session after work. Back in my party days I used to hook the strap of my backpack through a part of the chair and never got my bag stolen. What kind of tips or funny ideas do you have for a presentation to help people avoid getting their shit stolen while their necking a handful of lagers back at the pub? We have a young party culture with a lot of remote travel/work with clients that pay VERY well, so the old school grizzled administrator answers about making them pay for it or not bring their laptops home won't be helpful.

 I have a quick question for those of you using Anyconnect VPN on ASA/FTD.
 When you upload Anyconnect images to the VPN appliance, do upload only the latest version that your company uses or all possible images that are present in your enviroment?
 Is there a reason to upload older versions on the firewall at all?
 Only thing I can think of is the recent bug in Anyconnect that triggers auto update even if it's disabled in the XML.
 Another reason could be related to XML scheme that might change some parameters between releases of the supplicant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Corel acquired Roxio. We ran into a strange issue with a Roxio product and reached out to their support. Hands down, the most incompetent group of "technicians" I've encountered in ~20 years of working in IT.
 Our ticket was escalated to the higher tier of support and they initially attempted to help. But once none of their recommendations worked, they said "Unfortunately your product version is no longer supported."
 I replied saying that can't possibly be true, as you all are still actively selling the product. So they backtrack and ask, "May I know proof of purchase?" To which I responded that we no longer have the receipt. But sent them the activation key, the email used to originally purchase the software, and a screenshot logged into said account on our registered products page.
 From here, they send, "Another user may be able to help you get an answer in one of the forums" to which they provide a link that just goes to their parent company's main page with no forums mentioned anywhere.
 So I inform them of this... and the response? "May I know proof of purchase" - same exact guy I have been speaking to this whole time. 
 I open a second ticket in an attempt to get a different technician. Specifically ask not to get "Mr. XYZ" and I end up back with him anyways. We have the exact same conversation mentioned above and this is a never ending loop. We got so frustrated we decided to say fuck that software and bought a similar one from a different vendor.
 TL:DR - Corel bought Roxio. Their support sucks dick for gas money, and then rides their bike.

 Employees are encouraged to work from home and need to appear only twice a week. Max capacity of 60 devices running fully on cloud apps at the premisesas well. No local file servers, no VoIP, no email servers, none of that legacy tech. So floating population of employees using unassigned desks with only docking stations and monitors that connect to company issued chromebooks for better productivity. 
 All client devices i.e chromebooks, tablets, mobile phones, new printers will run over wifi.
 Though we feel WiFi should work here if implemented properly. What are the biggest issues to be weiry of? What would the challenges be when scaling up the number of clients in the future?

 When configuring Radius/User/Privileges, there is no option to set the privilege level of Radius users. When Radius users login, they have no privileges which makes the user basically useless.
 I've reached out to our account team and the manufacturer and they report that the underlying SDK doesn't allow for them to set the privilege level of Radius users and we would need to use TACACS.
 Surely this can't be the case. Radius authentication without the ability to use the Radius user? No VSA, template user, default privilege adjustment? I have to create a user locally before it can be useful?
 Somebody tell me this isn't true.

For example they have purchased media devices for online TV but with these devices you can only enter the WiFi password which obviously will not work.
 I've reached out the provider about the issue and they told me just open up the web browser on these media devices to authenticate which I keep telling them it doesn't work that way. Has anyone dealt with similar issue or this type of issues at all.

I'm looking to take my networking skills and move towards network automation / DevOps role. Any tips or things to study to start to navigate towards that direction? I have device experience with bigger vendors already (Cisco, Juniper, Fortigate, Meraki & etc) so I'm ready a little familiar with Python via Cisco. Also, if there are any certs or things to better my resume, I'm always down to get more certs!
 A little history: Been in the network field 5+ yrs. I currently have CCTRS, CCNA & JNCIA. I learned deeper protocols and Troubleshooting working for an ISP then moving to this MSP got more advanced with firewalls and internal routing protocols. I was considering getting the Cisco DevNet then continuing to CCNP vía that route but I heard it doesn't hold much weight in careers right now. 
 Any advice is beneficial! Thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has me looking into and meeting with Front App. We are a logistics company and the volume of email we get is tremendous, we receive around 100k emails a day for a 150 person company. A lot of it is emails going to multiple people because of how teams and distribution groups are setup.
 I have sent out training to users on how to create rules and manage the volume of mail with retention policies and even showing them how they can bulk delete them selves online, but it seems to be getting too much and users aren't following direction. We have tried shared mailboxes for some teams, but due to the volume of mail and people accessing it, it tends to crash outlook and does more harm then good. 
 I have a meeting with Front's technical team, just want to know if anyone has tried to make the transition to a software like this and is there anything I am looking over? And or how have you overcome the problem of high volumes of email?
 Concerns I have:
  
We have around 1000 distribution groups which we would have to use Microsoft's SMTP settings for each distribution group and would be a manual setup for each. The other option is using Front and their servers and updating our SPF/DKIM records, though then Microsoft will then not have a record of those outbound emails.
 Adds another point of failure for email, as now if Front goes down everything will be forwarded to their system.
 Learning curve for end users, we would have to switch around 80% of our company to this.

 1. Can I use the RMI+RP under the redundancy settings for these devices even though they are on different subnets? If not, any other ideas for HA?
 2. On the initial deployment of the .ova, there was a step where we could have put in the S/N and PnP information. Is that necessary for full functionality? If so, where do I find the S/N?

 I have 4 users on Mac's that I need to export their mail from and then import that mail into their new email address which is a completely different domain name. If I'm remembering correctly, Mac can't export to PST and it's an OLM file (I think?) 
 User 1 = 48GB
 User 2 = 47GB
 User 3 = 20GB
 User 4 = 70GB (I thought 50gb was the max but here we are)
 Normally on a PC I would just export to PST and then import into their new account in Outlook. I feel like is outdated and there might be a different or better way to do this? I know PST's can get corrupted during the export/import process so this whole process feels fragile. 
 Any ideas, suggestions, tips or wild ass guesses are welcome. I've considered joining the French Foreign Legion to avoid this so that is always an option. 
 Thank you!

 I'm going to be sitting in for an interview (virtual) in a few hours and I'm pretty nervous.
 It's for a Network Computer Support Technician position.
 Here are some of the PD:
 The Tier 1 maintenance of the on-site ADCS systems and subsystems, performing preventive and corrective maintenance and monitoring the on-site and remote locations. 
 Operations and maintenance of communications/computer systems and networks.
 Installs communications/computer systems in accordance with the respective installation spec.
 Troubleshooting and support of communications systems/networks.
 Working knowledge of Cisco system support/maintenance, VMware ESXi system support/maintenance, Active Directory, Windows Server 2019, HBSS, ACAS, SQL, SolarWinds, and Splunk preferred.
 Terminate ADCS circuits activated at the node point-of-presence (POP).
 I have my Net+ and Sec+ but not much experience other than doing some A+ stuff at a small PC shop in highshcool
 Any tips for the interview would be greatly appreciated!

 Every so often I'll notice two user accounts in our domain with VERY similar names, usually one character is different (e.g. Jon Smith/John Smith/John Smyth). You can tell they're the same person because their Office, Job Title, Department, even their unique employee number is the same.
 How on earth do I go about finding them without just poring through a list of 3500+ users? Is there an Excel function I can use?

Our compliance team mentioned that a requirement they've been issued by one of our auditors is to provide print verification, so sensitive print jobs don't just get left at the printer for anyone to pick up (finance reports, etc). We've considered both PIN verification at the printer's display panel, or badge scanning.
 Those of you who have set this up, what method are you using and what were the hardware requirements. Are you using a print server, and if so, what software are you running and is it on-prem or cloud based? If you're using badge scanning, what model of scanner are you using? Any information you could provide on your setup would be helpful, I'm just trying to get a lay of the land before I make any big decisions on server hardware or software contracts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have problem with EAP-TLS on Cisco ISE. Access to our WiFi is based on machine certificates. Computers with Windows OS use Anyconnect supplicant and it works good. But problem is with MacOSX. Anyconnect supplicant is not supporting this system so we need to use built-in supplicant. We try as below:
  
Machine certificate on MacOSX, but by default, iOS and macOS supplicants use the certificate identity common name for the EAP Response Identity it sends to the RADIUS server during 802.1X negotiation. So we get host name as a username - ISE can't find this username and rejecting connection.
 User certificate on MacOSX, but we get error: "EAP-TLS failed SSL/TLS handshake because of an unsupported certificate in the client certificate chain". Enhanced-Key-Usage is "client authentication" because I found that "all purpose" can be blocked.
  
Do you have any idea?

 New R750 and did a normal LifeCycle Controller install of Server 2022 on the bare metal RAID1 BOSS and it's showing a D drive named "OS" that is 2GB FAT in Disk Manager and an E drive labelled "OEMDRV".
 Looks like OEMDRV will disappear by itself but does anyone know what the OS partition and drive letter is all about please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow Sysadmins,
 I would like to take a moment to address all the hardworking Admins and System Engineers who may have faced moments of intense stress while working on critical infrastructure. I want to extend my apologies for potentially wasting your time, but I felt it was important to reach out and share my recent experience.
 Recently, I was working on our ESXi cluster and FC Fabric to add another storage system.
 I had to reload the FC zone, and despite knowing that the other switch should carry the load, the system briefly halted, causing me great concern. My heart raced as I feared the worst, but fortunately, the failover worked as expected.
 I understand that moments like these can be incredibly stressful and can take a toll on one's mental and emotional well-being. I empathize with anyone who has experienced similar situations and want you to know that you are not alone. Let's continue to support each other and work together to ensure that our critical systems remain stable and secure.
 Thank you for all the hard work that you do, and I wish you all the best.

 I used to work in a ~120 heads high tech/cloud computing/manufacturing/ex Start Up (still behaving like one) company in an 1,5 head internal IT department (Doing everything but working on our actual products). Me being the 1 fully busy head.
 Got a support call from a senior cloud engineer [second year in cloud, plus maybe 5 in analytics experience ontop] (Working on the actual product). User needed help setting up new desk, new dock, monitors and all that.
 "Hey, could you please help me? My screens are all kinda messed up. The right one shows the same as the left one..." I right click, open screen settings, change to extended and arrange the screens. "Wow, that was easy. Thanks for showing me yada yada .."
 How dafuq can such a person manage to complete a bachelor's degree in IT?! 
 Imagine them standing in front of the committee of IT Professors, trying to defend their thesis and going: "Hmm, the beamer throws my Power Point notes on the wall, it's not supposed to do that. Could you please call IT support?"
 And the Prof.: "Sure no problemo, let's call them and wait a fucking eternity until they come in and fix this damn beamer. Back in the old days we used overhead Projectors were it was impossible to paste the notes on the wall, because who would be so stupid to print them on the same piece of foil as the presentation. The good old times, am I right?"
 I myself am only working ~6 years in IT (3 years apprenticeship[Ausbildung in Germany], 3 years hands on). But I notice with a lot of new graduate IT colleagues comming from university, their basic skills are just non existent.
 A friend of mine seriously tried to buy network HUBs in his company, because he learned in university that those can transmit data way faster because of the lack of overhead. He got really upset that you can no longer buy those. o_O

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, let me apologize if this is supposed to be something basic to ask but I can't figure out where I can find the right settings. 
 We have started deployment of HP thin clients in our environment and now getting started testing out HP Device Manager. Initially, I installed HP Device Manager on my PC and discovered the thin clients on the network. Now I have installed the HP Device Manager on the server and was also able to discover the same thin client devices from the new server and able to push settings to the thin clients without issue.
 ​
 I am wondering if there is a settings somewhere that once an HP thin client has been discovered and configured, it will only access connections from a sort of "approved HP Device Manager server" and allow it settings to be change when some sort of authentication is done.
 ​
 In terms of security, there is firewall between server subnet and think client subnet that can block unwanted traffic but the issue lies that, in the current state, device on the same broadcast network as the thin client are able to discover the think client.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions and solutions.

 I have 2 job opportunity´s who have offered basically the same salary package. Both work places are 30 minutes away and one has 30 somewhat employees and the other 10.
 One workplace wants me to manage their private cloud which hosts applications and is used across the world. However they only use open source (proxmox, proxmox backup, local emailservers (cant remember the name), nothing in Azure, no m365, only old generation hardware) and windows services (ad, iis, rdp sessions, ...) for clustering and redundancy.
 The other workplace also wants me to manage their datacenter, but mostly go on projects to customers to replace firewalls, servers, storage, migrate AD etc... and uses industry standards (azure, m365, hpe, vmware, hyperv,...) however they are a small company and are less visible in the community. They also have an older standards of the workplace (fixed hours, no remote work) 
 Ive recently been studying and certificating in azure and vmware, and it seems a waste should i choose company 1. Im sure i can get the datacenter migraties to azure and vmware in the future but then ill be working with non industry standards (in my region at least) for at least a couple years. It will be challenging and ill definetly have freedom, but will not gain experience in hardware or cloud technology.
 Company 2 seems a better fit regarding my study and experience, but I fear being invisible in the community.
 Based on this, what option would you go for? I currently work somewhere with a 1 to 2 hour drive so they are tempting offers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys
 I have a Lenovo Think System T250 standalone server with Windows Server 2019 that has suddenly become slow. I highly suspect that it is the operating system volume drives (RAID 1, 2 drives) that are causing the issue as performance monitor is detecting high I/O and all else appears fine. There are C and D volumes, each with 2 drives in RAID 1. I plan on replacing the drives volume C with ones with same capacity and higher read/write speeds.
 ​
 What would be the best way to go about changing these drives?
  
Shutting down server, replacing 1 of the drives and starting backup, let it rebuild then do same with second drive.
  
2.Taking image backup of Volume C, shutting down, taking both drives out and replacing with new ones and recover from the image backup with bootable flash drive. Would this cause issue with volume D?
 Or any other suggestions would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am currently developing a multiplayer video game that will be using UDP P2P and I wish to use hole/nat punching to solve the issue with users not having to configure their router ports and/or network settings.
 I've managed to set up a system with a middle hand server that introduces users to each other (I believe it is called a STUN server?). Each user connects to this and a user (client) can request to be matched with another user (host). If a suitable host is found, the host is notified of the client and vice versa, they then start punching each other. This setup seems to work as intended, for most cases at least...
 The problem I am facing is in the case that the hosting user is on a non-public ip adress. The "handshake" via hole punching does not seem to get confirmed and the connection fails.
 Is there some kind of way to solve this issue? A relay server is not really part of the plan as it includes additional latency and costs.
 ​
 Edit: or could this issue not be related to the IP being private and instead be a router issue?

 I end up in systemd networking, netplan, etc/network/interfaces, configuring interfaces manually. Would there be a way I could have a docker container to consolidate this and point applications to a local subnet 127.0.100.1 or 127.0.200.1 and it would have within the container NAT database for mangling those to send over tunnel before the open internet.
 Would I be able to accomplish something similar to this in docker when I would give each application machines a /29 or /28 for multiple addresses it needs to reference and translate?

 the ISR1111 is the default gateway for the production network as x.x.x.1/29 on G0/0/1
 The WAN is connected via G0/0/0
 there is a firewall between the production network at x.x.x.2/29
 The ISR1111 happens to also have 8 switch ports off to the side at G0/1/x
 I have a test firewall plugged into the ISR at G0/1/0 with x.x.x.3/29 & GW: x.x.x.1
 I've seen mention of creating a vlan & SVI and ip add x.x.x.4/29, then assigning G0/1/0 to access that vlan
 But would that get traffic routing from a public IP? or would this method only work if the VLAN was a private address and NAT was enabled?
 Are we just missing an ip route from x.x.x.4 to x.x.x.2?
 Unfortunately my layer 3/routing knowledge is lackluster and I feel I'm beating my head against a wall on this one.
 There's a support ticket in with the ISP to config their equipment, but I'm trying to understand what would be needed in this scenario and, I don't have access to an ISR image to lab it.
 EDIT: I should add, I haven't found a router image in my lab that has a layer 2 only add-in card

 Where I'm confused is, I thought DKIM was a protection for spoofing.

 We are struggling to decide the best course of action for 900+ users. I believe we will not be using FIDO2 at this time so our only options are Enroll on Behalf Of for every single user and manually map the cert to their ADuser or send the Yubikeys out and have the users use Self Enrollment. Also we would like these to autorenew every 1-2 years (still deciding on timeframe) but I haven't come across a way for the cert to renew and get updated on the Yubikey itself, only a way for the user themselves to renew and put on the Yubikey.
 Trying to get ideas from people that currently use Yubikey and determine the best route forward.

 Currently the campus has a pair of HA Palo Alto’s. They lead down to two cores which are Nexus 7706s. The two cores feed roughly 40 building totaling to 118 closets.
 The cores are in VDCs. One VDC on each core is for the buildings described above (call it the staff vdc). This VDC has L3 connectivity to the other VDC for the data center. 
 A majority of L3 default gateways live at the distribution layer for the staff vdc and most L3 gateways for DC vlans live in the data center core.
 The team is being tasked with segmenting traffic.
 Would you all migrate L3 gateways to the PANs to zone them or would you VRF and leave the L3s where they are? The vrfs could match zone names going forward What’s the industry standard for this ? Is there another option i’m totally missing?
 Thoughts and opinions appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting ready to place the bid on my second networking job that I will be doing in an RV park.
 The park has about 70 available slots for RVs/campers. Each location has an outdoor weather protected power outlet that I could use for a POE. 
 Several of the RV locations also have existing coax and conduit all ran to one central location that I can utilize as a hub for a switch and place access points in several locations.
 However I also noticed that some of the coax was ran to the point of service for our ISP near a pole and would not be able to be utilized as I believe the drop belongs to them ( we work for the most of thel isps).
 I'm looking for a recommendation on some ubiquity equipment that could be both hardwired and wirelessly bridged for setting up one large or several small mesh networks.
 I'll also take any advice anyone else has here on formats of asking questions for my post or any job tips.
 I'm sure I could wear my way through it on my own but I would love to hear from somebody who's done more than one.
 Most of the networking experience I do have has been just simply running CAT5 and commercial buildings and setting up a simple switch, point to point radios and serval years trouble shooting internet, phone lines and simple wifi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone reading had any experience with using either netbox or nautobot as a source of truth to feed into an automation orchestration system like Ansible specifically for standing up EVPN VXLAN symmetric IRB fabric data centers? There are a lot of unique data point relationships that the data models don't handle out of the box. There are some free plugins, but nothing substantial without doing some significant customization it seems. For example, with a pool of VLANs which fabric VRF are each of the VLANs present in? Or which vlan is used for the IBGP peering within a fabric VRF? Which loopback is the SNAT interface for that VRF? These relationships can be made in static VAR files, but we're trying not to do that and use a dynamic source for inventory and variables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I posted here recently about issues we are having where AD users are getting locked out by the Exchange Server. Things have evolved a little and I am certain the lockouts are coming from Exchange, but I have looked through every Exchange/IIS log I can find and I am unable to find corresponding attempts to access these users' mailboxes. 
 I finally enlisted Microsoft Support after reaching my wits end with this issue and dropped the $500 on a ticket. After a day and a half of intermittently working with them to investigate the issue, they came to the conclusion that...the Exchange server was the source of the lockouts...
 They admitted that I knew that when I submitted the ticket, so they told me they were going to refund the cost of the ticket, but we need to reach out to premier support for a RCA (root cause analysis) as they had reached their limitations in assisting us (they didn't even get as far along as I did in my own investigating...). 
 So I reached out to premier support. Where I'm told you need a premier support contract to get support from them. That contract, I am told, starts at $53,000. $53,000 is what it would cost us to get support from Microsoft, on a Microsoft product, that we already pay heavily for for the "privilege" of using...
 Does this align with anybody else's experience? Are there any other options for us that don't involve spending $53,000? This just seems absolutely insane to me how useless they are in supporting their products!

Company is providing the devices because this person is important enough that we need them to be reachable and have access to company data. Because these are manager types we haven't really put any restrictions on the phones, the MDM/DEP at this point is just so we can remote wipe or recover PIN after someone is let go. We push one or two LoB apps but they can install whatever apps they want. A few have a separate personal phone but most use the company phone as their only phone, which means all sorts of random apps installed. It's interesting to me to see what kinds of apps people have so I look occasionally. Turns out 27 of them have TikTok. 
 So, to block or not to block. That is the question....
 We're in manufacturing and don't really have any particularly special IP if that makes a difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to see if anyone has ever seen similar issues before. A few weeks ago, we started noticing random switchports on the network in various locations in many different L2 domains learning hundreds of mac address on access ports. My initial thought was obviously some time of switching loop. Fast forward a few days, we start seeing the same behavior on multiple (50-100) ports throughout the network. The only commonality between these ports are that they all have a USB-C style docking station attached to them with a laptop. Port-security is helping stop the mac-addresses from overloading, but I'm curious if anyone has ever ran into something like this? We have tried updating the drivers on the docking station with no avail. Some ports are learning almost a mac-address/second. The mac-addresses seem to be totally random as well. When looking up the OUI, many come back with nothing. Any help would be appreciated.

So we currently have a guy who holds numerous hats in our IT department (sys admin, network admin, security admin and more) my thing is he is trying to gate keep a lot of roles and does not want anyone else (new sys admin, and service desk guys) to have access to certain things like AD, servers, network monitoring tools etc. He’s been here longer than our manager so I believe he makes alot of his own decisions based off his ease of use and comfort which imo should not be the case especially if he is implementing security processes. I feel there would be a lack of true security if it is mainly just benefiting him rather than the company. With that being said I believe we should hire a IT security guy to audit/ work with us but work on a different team. I thought this would be a standard thing but it seems like it’s not am I wrong for thinking this way? Should there not be a IT security guy.

 I currently work IT at a small / local bank with main building and a single remote branch in the same town. We connect to our primary financial vendor internal networks via an MPLS router at the main building (there's also a secondary VPN router for fail-over and we're routing certain traffic to a virtual IP but MPLS is the primary route) - just referring to it as the "FI gateway". Then, there are static routes set up in our firewall which route traffic for certain IP's and networks used by bank apps through that FI gateway.
 For the remote branch building, it is connected to the main branch via site-to-site VPN tunnel and the bank apps used there have their traffic routed back to the …]]></summary>

I'm asking because I'm just curious that's all. We have a 9800wlc which is just buggy as hell and has been a nightmare so far as we've had issues with phones not been able to connect to the Cisco aironet aps and just general wifi issues.
 It's not like we will replace the wlc as we just replaced our old 5508 with this 9800 but yeah just thinking of a scenario where if we would replace it with Aruba stuff then how would it mesh with the Cisco stuff.
 And I asked about Aruba because I know that Aruba aps and wlcs are better than their Cisco equivalents.
 Thank you.

I know people hate seeing we are like family here in a listing. Also, I know government IT doesn't fit the fast paced environment cliche but those jobs seem hard to come by. How about competitive salary? Imagine a listing where it says we offer a non competitive salary?

They aren't very tech savvy so If i ask "What's not working or loading?" the response is always something along the lines of everything. They can't tell me if it's a windows issue or an issue with the browser or website they are trying to use, but granted in some cases I do come to a users machine that take forever to even click the windows start bar or launch an application. I was looking at task manager on one the other day and the CPU and RAM were clocked out from either two tabs of chrome or applications that shouldn't be running. 
 I know this is a common thing when it comes to IT work, but I just wanted to get some advice on what I could do to at least make them think the computer is speeding up or actually help that one employee who is actually having the issues. I'm quite new to IT work especially being the only Tech so I guess an Admin. Any advice or tools that I could utizilize would be greatly appreaciated. 
 I already run ccleaner and Malwarebytes and then uninstall any programs that shouldn't be there, even though we have endpoint running on all our pc's for viruses but it doesn't cause issues unless an update or scan is being performed. 
 Thanks for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, does the notes I've made below (along with the one question too) sound about right when describing active vs passive authentication? Let's assume the firewall I mentioned to is a Firepower device too (not that it would matter anyway)
 Active authentication actively prompts the user to sign in before they try and access a website and then after that it will go through the access policy to see if that user account matches any rules for that username for them to be able to access a particular website. You can specify what managed device (computer/vm) you want the user to see this authentication prompt on when they try and access the internet. When it says authentication method is HTTP basic, what does that mean? Does it mean that the device (firewall) will open a port 80 connection with the domain controller to check to see if the users entreded creds are correct and then authenticate the user? 
 Passive authentication won't prompt the user when they're on a device and will instead check ISE (which is acting as the user agent) to tell ISE to go and check AD for the ip to user and group mappings for the account that is presented to ISE and then retrieves that info from the DC's and builds the connection logs out also uses that information to then go through the access policies and check to see if any rules are hit too 
 These 2 authentication methods only work with 80/443 traffic

 I feel like the whole intune interface is like those phones for kids, there’s buttons and options but none do anything because Microsoft knows best.
 Get intune they said…it’ll be fun they said.
 Update: While most comments point to a missconfiguration, which I truly believed as well for a while, I'm still scratching my head as to why this happened in the past couple of days.
 Even so, I can understand that we missed something, but that begs the question, why would this be buried in some obscure settings.
 We have one policy in "Update rings for Windows 10 and later" with an Update Ring Settings "Upgrade Windows 10 devices to Latest Windows 11 release" clearly set to "No" and clearly correctly applying to all corporate devices. This has worked great since Windows 11 released 1 year ago almost, yet today, out of the F*IN blue, without anyone editing anything have I mentioned that?
 Note to self, do not post anything without fully accepting blame, in writing, even if flared as rant.

 Hey, I just wanted to thank everyone for their amazing advice on my last post. Your expertise and kind words helped me take action and improve my situation. Some of you even reached out to me in private to help me out with writing a CV, Configuring the network, fixing the VMware issues and so on, so i feel like i owe you guys an update. 
 I compiled all the evidence I had of rude and stressful interactions with users and wrote out my account of the situation from memory. Then, I printed everything out and went to speak with my workplace leadership. I was acutally shaking so much you could hear the paper move LMAO, but I explained in detail how a certain boss treated me, including how he asked me to break the law to get something he wanted (I had email evidence), and how much it stressed me out when he would be angry that i didn't follow through. I also explained how this workload was too much for one person to carry, and the person I spoke with took me seriously, and I was put on sick leave with pay until I can see a doctor. They're launching an investigation into that boss starting from the very top, and addressing the rotten workplace culture in a discrete manner.
 I have a doctor's appointment on Monday, and I'll most likely get a mental health sick note to take some time off. As for the job interview I mentioned, it didn't work out because I didn't have some Office 365 Certs :D but at least I have time now to look for something better! Also, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW ULTRA CORPORATE THAT PLACE WAS, It almot felt like a cult where everyone was one "giant happy family"! 
 Once again, thank you all for your support and advice. I truly appreciate it and feel like I've played my cards right to improve my situation.

 everything worked perfectly fine and I can see all the data in the new installation, however, noticed that the main search function (all the way top)no longer works for the items that got migrated to the new system, I can manually go to the site/devices and see those. but not using the search option.
 but if I add new items to the netbox, only for those items, the search functionality works as expected.
 For example, suppose I had 10.100.1.1 in the old db, and I added 10.100.1.2 to netbox. 
 When I search with 10.100. in the top search bar, it will now show only 10.100.1.2 which was added newly, not the migrated data.
 Did anyone know how to fix this?
 how to reproduce the issue?
  
Deploy netbox following the official doc in new env.
 dump the database on the old netbox machine.
 migrate the database following the article.
 And search for the items in the migrated db.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, change in management has led to a change in ideology for naming endpoint computers.
 I prefer to just use the device serial number (usually a Dell TAG so 7 characters). new boss wants [unit]-[initial][surname] (e.g. COY-KSmith) type host names. FWIW we had 3 Kevin Smiths at one point. 
 I prefer the abstracted and unique option, mostly for simplicity as the name is printed on the device by the manufacturer. He prefers the generated name so it's easy to guess what a user's computer is called. 
 We are using SCCM so I feel it's easy enough to get to the host via the username, plus I see no benefit with adding a manual tier to this process that will need maintenance if a laptop is reassigned, or replaced. 
 I'm interested to know what does the community think about this? not so much a what do you do questions, we all have our systems that we just do because we've always done it this way, but if you think about it as a green field exercise, what seems reasonable? My issue is I can see his point, and there are some merits to it, but not enough IMO.

 ​
 We have 2016 AD DS environment.

 - 2012R2 AD CS machine
 ​
 We have been doing some hardening work on AD CS machine. We had a company do a vulnerability assessment on our network and they found an issue on one of our servers.
 ​
 My question is : Has anyone had any problems after changing this hardening?
 thanks,

 Right now, we don't have any strategy for testing the updates. I just approve them in a regular basis. (I have automatic approval for Defender definitions and Edge updates.)
 Although I know that's NOT the best option, I don't really know how can I manage the updates.
 I think I'd need a test group of clients for receiving the updates first. Then, after a period of time, I'd approve these updates to all production clients.
 By clients, I mean servers and desktops/laptops.
 I'd like to know from you, what would be the best options/practices to manage WSUS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a series of comments (that I can’t find with Search) discussing whether RAID alone can be considered HA. Some said Yes by confining the scope of the analysis to the drives.
 Others pointed out that a single RAID controller or power supply failure would defeat the HA nature of the RAID drives.
 Wikipedia states:
 There are three principles of systems design in reliability engineering which can help achieve high availability.
 Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding or building redundancy into the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system. Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure. Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover. Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure – but the maintenance activity must. ....
 It strikes me that there is an important distinction between having some redundant components and having no single point of failure.
 I can see that RAID alone has good capacity to improve availability, but I wouldn’t say RAID is HA. What’s your view?
 Edit: good replaces limited

 But first of first, why? What's the deal with Microsoft delaying this key security upgrade? Why are they pushing it back so far? 
 But I guess the delay might be to give organizations enough time to switch over to using number match for Microsoft Authenticator with push notifications. This is a big deal because it adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to confirm their sign-in attempts with an additional secured factor. Plus, the delay will give organizations a chance to properly test and set up their MFA policies, so they won't cause any issues!

 Hello all, Im a little bit confused looking around at the switches there seem to be so many choices!
 I am working on a project at work, i've asked our IT to give me a hand but they are incredibly busy right now so unlikely to have a response from them for a couple of days.
 Ideally i would like to make my purchases today so I could have them from next week.
 I'm trying to run a project that will take a 10GB ethernet cable from a server PC.
 This will need to go to a switch that can output to 20 other connected devices.
 These connected devices dont need to be 10gb, so 1gb is fine.
 I keep on coming across devices that have a 10gb fiber connection. and I see you can get adaptors for these ports but most of them are saying adaptor for "insert switch manufacture", is this a marketing gimmick or is there something that stops them from working with other switch manufacturers?
 ​
 Would some be able to recomend a switch that would work for this?
 ​
 I will need to connect up to 40 devices to this Server but is has a 4 port 10gb switch output so if it makes more economical sense I am happy to get smaller switches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Just wondering if I am missing something. Looking at options to add a GPU to improve performance on our Remote Desktop Session Hosts. Currently all RDSH Servers are VMs Virtualized using Hyper-V as the Hypervisor.
 By the looks of it I need a Enterprise NVidia GPU that is compatible with the Server (Dell PowerEdge R640 for example can support an NVIDIA T4 GPU).
 However reading online, Microsoft have removed vGPU / RemoteFX Support from Windows Server 2016 Build 1084. So this is a no go.
 I think I need the following:
 > An Enterprise Driver License from NVidia
 > A physical GPU installed in a Server, for example the NVIDIA T4
 > A Hypervisor that supports vGPU
 Looking on the NVidia Website, it looks like this is only supported using the following Hypervisors:
 > VMWare vSphere
 > Citrix Hypervisor 8.4
 Both of the above Hypervisors are incredibly expensive in terms of licensing. If I use what I currently have (Hyper-V - Server 2019) this would not allow vGPU or Remote FX, but would only allow physical mapping, so 1 x Physical GPU directly mapped using DDA to the Guest VM RDSH.
 Am I missing something here, how are other enterprises adding Shared vGPUs to their Virtualised RDSH VMs to improve performance? Or is this exactly why VMWare / Citrix are still in business?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I am not a system administrator. I am a developer who handles a few web applications hosted on a DMZ server (or network?). Since they are my web applications, it is my job to ensure the servers stay updated and our wildcard certificates are installed.
 I didn’t really know what to do or how to do it so I kind of just guessed. I had the certificate file and the PFX file (assuming this was the key.) I double-clicked the PFX, put in the password, and it installed. I bound it in IIS with the correct Site and it looked like it worked! Hooray, lol.
 But when I looked into it further I noticed it installed the certificate under the Personal folder. I also noticed there were plenty of other certificate stores/folders in the CertMgr. 
 So my question is, what do these other folders entail? Are they simply just for organization or does each folder hold a different set of policies/security so it truly does matter where the certificate is installed to? 
 I tried Google and it led me to another post in this sub, but it only confused me more lol. Any help would be appreciated or if you can point me in the right direction that would be great!

 So I've been working as a Linux administrator so far (around 2 years) and was offered a position called "IT Application Administrator"
 The IT team member emphasised the word "Application". The role will involve setting up applications on Linux servers e.g. setting up a Web server, configurations, installing the application, some security and testing stuff etc. "Plan-build-run". 
 Ansible will be used for automation. Maybe some shell scripting. I will obviously be using the command line a lot.
 The part that I won't be doing is actually creating the VM/setting up the server and I probably won't be monitoring the infrastructure. 
 Even then, this seems like a Linux role to me? I asked him and he seemed hesitant to call it that.

 I'm currently stuck with the following problem:
 Environment:
 - RDS-Farm (Gateways, Connection Broker, Session Hosts - all W2019 Servers)
 - the RDP-Connection is triggered via the RDP-File downloaded from RDWeb-Page
 ​
 Problem:
 - I start RDP-File in my W11 client, enter the credentials (MFA is also triggered) and the logon works 
 - I start RDP-File #2 (different Username) and the Username from the first connection is the default value. I change to "user different account", enter the second credentials but the MFA is still triggered with the account of the first session.
 ​
 Ho do i get W11 to ALWAYS use the provided username/password? It seems, that there's some kind of cache or something that.
 ​
 I hope the explanation is understandable :-)
 ​
 any tipps would be appreciated. 
 ​
 thx and cheers from austria

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently left a Glassdoor review for a company I interviewed with, but didn't end up getting the job. I wanted to alert other candidates about the red flags I found during the hiring process. However, the company somehow managed to trace the review back to me, and I have no idea how they did it.
 To be honest, I'm not even scared or intimidated that they found out it was me behind the review. I've been job searching since I got laid off, and I don't care about burning bridges at this point. Companies already burn bridges with their bad treatment and terrible hiring processes, treating employees and job candidates as disposable assets.
 The hiring manager even sent me an email to schedule a call with him to clarify some of the points I made in my review and to see if there's a job opportunity for me. But I've been burned by corporate so many times that I have serious trust issues with companies. At this point in my life, I don't believe anything that comes from them, especially if they start dangling carrots in front of me.
 I admit, I'm curious to know how they traced the review back to me, but I'm not willing to risk my privacy to find out. I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Glassdoor reviews being traced back to them. What are your thoughts on this situation? Should I take the call from the hiring manager, or is it not worth my time?
 I'm open to any honest feedback and opinions. Thanks for reading.

 I am trying to understand the differences between the below 2 port configuration. The client conencted to these ports are working fine. Whats the effect of having 'switchport mode access' in the second config?
 What's the best practice while creating interfaces? Do i need to use 'switchport mode access' for all ports where clients will be connected ex. vlan 20?
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/2
 switchport access vlan 20
 spanning-tree portfast
 --------------------------
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/6
 switchport access vlan 20
 switchport mode access
 spanning-tree portfast

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Evening Everyone,
 I wanted to get the insight of some other people within the system administration field. What I'm looking to better understand is at what point does administration become engineering. Based on my experience the line is thin and dependent on the organization that you work for. The way I've reasoned this out in my head in the past is that administration is mainly monitoring/maintaining while engineering tends to be more focused on the planning/creation/building of infrastructure.
 It appears that a lot of employers tend to blur these lines. Though it could just be skewed perspective based on my experience. I'd like to have some idea of where this line is so that I can better educate and prepare myself when negotiating with my current employer and/or other potential employers.

 Now that the older devices are EOL, we can't get support (security updates, etc) any more so we need to recycle them.
 Any recommendations for how to do this? I see lots of things on the Cisco site about trade ins with purchase but nothing for just recycling.
 If there are any community minded businesses, the group is open to accepting donations of recent model "gently used" (within manufacturer's service life) equipment for the group's student run facility on the Eastern plains of Colorado.

 This week I discovered a "solution" created by a helpful guy that was mostly doing the desired job but he reached our to me for help. This guy made this elaborate python "thing" to do some stuff on excel. I was both impressed and horrified. The "helpful guy" was rather sad that I solved the requirements in three hours with VBA and significantly less lines of code.
 That got me thinking, how do others determine what solution set is best for a given requirement. My team has broad skills. For example I do powershell, VBA, HTML, CSS, Javascript and if I'm really pushed to it, .net. Others are equally diverse but we have a REST guy that consumes APPIs like candy. Got another in Microsoft power platform and on.
 So when we get a request, usually I can look at it and push it to the best solution based on my experience.
 How do others handle that?

 Anyways,
 I've gotta provide an Encryption Domain space for our end of the IPSEC connection. Would this be the address space attached to our 'outside' port 192.168.0.0/28 or the 'inside' port 192.168.2.0/28?
 I've been able to ascertain that the domain would be the address space meant to traverse the tunnel but I haven't found an answer as to which address space I should provide.

When the boxes come back up on the "new hardware", they're running weaker processors with slower memory. (Can't help but notice the price hasn't gone down to reflect this loss of power...) I've destroyed my personal systems and migrated to cheaper shared instances because "whatever", but at work, the new power differences between a few of my Docker Swarm worker nodes is creating imbalance where there was none before.
 Call my a cynic, but is this Akamai's influence bleeding in already? Seems pretty coincidental the big company comes in and suddenly my services are getting their corners cut off in a way that doesn't require them to lower vCPU or memory counts on their plans. Is this happening to anyone else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To not re-type everything. Let's just link these two threads here: Will this upgrade ruin my job?, When do you say it's out of my hands?,
 Last week we had a meeting to discuss the slowness issue of our app. Yes it has gotten considerably worse over the past six months. The three teams involved were county networking team, facility IT, contractor team, App Dev team. It took a meeting that also included all management inside the facility to complain about the app slowness and to get someone inside our facility to fix it. My facility managers arranged everything with the county network team, but I supplied IP addresses and the names of the users who were always complaining about slowness. I also showed the county network IT guys how users get on a fresh PC and how slow the app is. They agreed that there was a problem and worked their magic in the background.
 24 hours later users are experiencing a much better and faster virtual environment. They are thanking me left and right for fixing the issue, but all I did was complain to management every day for the past six months. Is this how it feels to be successful?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working with IOL Cisco devices in a virtual lab and have a collapsed core design. I have 2 core/distribution switches. On core 1 I have configured SVI for each VLAN. I want a second core switch (Core 2) to be able to take/distribute load while acting like a backup switch if Core1 goes down. Each access switch should have a redundant link to both Core1 and Core2. What configuration/technology should I look into to help me accomplish the redundant core switch?
 One option I have looked at include HSRP but that seems to be only for routers and not for SVI interfaces. I have also looked at VSS but I lack the hardware to test this feature.

If you take one of those radios and hit the transmit button next to one of our polycom phones while talking on the phone, it will immediately disconnect the phone call. Has anyone seen this before and/or have any ideas on how to prevent this from happening? We've told them to not use their radios near the phones but in an emergency situation where they're talking to 911 they need to be able to use both at the same time without having to walk away from the phone to use the radio.

 Hoping someone can answer this question for me pretty easily. There are two options for getting a virtual ASA in AWS marketplace. One is listed as BOL and the other is PAYG. My question is if you subscribe to the PAYG model, does that INCLUDE the cicso ASA license in the price or would that have to be a separate purchase like the BOL model? Here is the subscription in question:
 AWS Marketplace: Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Virtual - PAYG with 30-Day Free Trial (amazon.com)
 Spoke with AWS support and the basically said talk to cisco so here I am hoping someone can give me a straight answer on it. Can't seem to get anything concrete and cant talk with cisco support without having a subscription. Any help would be appreciated!

 I see them as solid for SMB infrastructure, but not really enterprise/datacenter ready. 
 We are currently running on proper enterprise gear like Cisco, PaloAlto, Fortinet, etc. 
 What, if any, would be a reason to stick with our known products that perform as expected to something like Cato?

Even this simplest cheapest printer now requires an internet connection otherwise it will stop printing. As the toner runs low it try to connect to its supply services to prompt you to buy new tone at exorbitant prices.
 I keep telling users DO NOT buy HP printers but they are cheap because they make their money on consumables. They are now more trouble than they are worth. I've been installing printers from A4 to A0 LED and laser printers for 25 years and have come to the point that these printers are a waste of time and effort. Users end up paying more for support on these printers than the printers cost and is false economy.

Note that this is an org with 12 staff, and no IT department. The single server is an Intel NUC, located in a wall mounted rack in the store room.
 I just got the report back, we failed on the following counts: 1. No penetration test done in the past 12 months. 2. Not enforcing 6 week password rotation (for local non admin accounts on their laptops) 3. No raised floors in the server room 4. No biometric security control for the server room 5. No aircon in the server room 6. Not encrypting off site backups 7. Running both windows 10 and windows 11 on the same network
 I now need to write a rebuttal to the auditors for this travesty of an audit.

 Note, i love the organization, and they are not to bland

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We have DBAs dumping Oracle RMAN backups to an NFS target. We need to replicate those backup files to a 2nd site. The storage devices at each site are different, so we need something that can do host-based replication.
 The RMAN backups are fulls each night, and looking for something smart enough to not send a full backup to the second site each time. I was looking at rsynch and it has a block level synch option, would that possibly work? 
 My main concerns are if the full RMAN dumps would trigger rsynch to send a full each time this won't work, but if it's smart enough to only send changed blocks each night this should be workable. The initial full will be the worst in terms of host impact and time, we will seed it locally if possible.
 Are there better tools for this type of host based copy approach? DBAs do not want a formal agent-based backup app, I understand there are better approaches. Dealing with what we have on hand right now and seeking feedback around rsynch or other 3rd party tools.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 Having a strange issue. All of the sudden, iPhone users can't get internet through my AP's, although they can connect to them, while Android users, and all of the Windows laptops are fine. I have a mix of Cisco 1702's, 1602's, and 1261's. Have reloaded AP's, changed patch cords, rebooted switches, cleared DHCP, but nothing works. They can associate just fine, they just get no internet and the phone shows IP addresses "0.0.0.x" (i.e. 0.0.0.120, 0.0.0.55, etc...). Checked GPO, nothing applied that would be preventing Apple devices.
 At this point I have to imagine it's a setting on the devices themselves, but wondering if anyone has ran into anything similar?

 I was hoping some you more seasoned SA's could help me out. We recently were notified that our Information System Security Officers (ISSO) need to have access to the windows logs on a very small network, which consists of, 6 desktops, and 3 servers. Now, I have log forwarding setup to have the logs sent to our File Server. What would be the best way to get the ISSOs access to the logs on that server without giving them admin accounts?

 I'm trying to work on something using the API for Tanium. I see in their doc: Reference: API Gateway examples (tanium.com) that they share an example: "Perform an action operation (mutation.actionPerform)"
 I'm just wondering if anyone has translated this into a curl or powershell script?
 ​
 In the past, I've only worked with the query API, so something similar to:
 $h = blahblah
 { endpoints(filter: {op: CONTAINS, path: "name", value: "' + $h + '"}) { edges { node { id name domainName ipAddress lastLoggedInUser model manufacturer } } } }'
 ​
 I'm also wanting to target the endpoints: [ID!] field instead of platform (In the example). I'm not sure however, to piece together the chain: Get the ID, Pass the ID and Add Tag: XXX.
 ​
 If you have done, or similar examples, let me know please.

 With that said, I’m tasked with replacing our on premise PBX and have evaluated several service providers for this purpose.
 Current contenders include 8x8, RingCentral, GoTo, and Ultatel.
 I’ve been able to find the information I need to make an informed decision on each of those with the exception of Ultatel.
 Does anyone have experience with them? How did it go/ how is it going? Their pricing is very aggressive and solution appears to include all the features we need (our requirements for a phone system are pretty simple compared to most).
 Thanks in advance

 The problem is that the provider assigns me a private IP and I set behind their small pool of public IPs hence no capability of reaching my NCR to watch the cameras.
 The only idea I've had so far is to bring up an L2TP to a third location which has a public IP and bounce my monitoring through there, but looks expensive and complicated.

 I have tried the 0365 reports script, but it only gets random meetings and nothing useful, even if I give it dates.
 My plan would be to:
  
Create alll meetings under a user
 Get all meetings for that user (they are available on Teams admin, power automate desktop might be a possibility to download them?)
 use a slightly modified script that we have to populate out attendance sheets.
  
Essentially, all it need to do is to automate getting the meeting attendance from team admin (I noticed that downloading the attendance register from teams itself sometimes fails, so I want something durable and the reports on Teams admin are simple and to the point) 
 Also, all the meetings are team meetings, so that is another limitation.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings my fellow networkers,
 I've discovered NeDi recently and I tried to set it up in our enterprise environment. I deployed it on a fresh VM with the latest Debian release (v11.6).
 I installed NeDi via the bash(version 2.2.22) I found on the website which works perfectly but I've been stuck on the RADIUS authentication. Problem is: There is not so much documentation about it and the community forum has its registration for new users currently disabled.
 I found this snippet of code in the nedi.conf file:
 # Authentication for GUI users can be set to: # local, sso, pam, radius, ldap or none # Append -pass to specify a password and optional CLI port for device access in Devices-Write (The GUI-username is used, if the User field is left empty) # Add 2nd argument with ldap or radius to assign groups to users which don't exist within NeDi (disabled if empty, minimal access with "usr,") # Be aware that ldap or radius may have problems with passwords containing language specific special characters #guiauth ldap usr,net,dsk,mon,oth, ;guiauth local # Override the Login and Logout URLs (e.g. for your SSO setup) # The defaults will be used if commented # Login URL Logout URL ;authurls User-Profile.php index.php # Set Radiusserver(s) parameters, if selected above # host port secret timeout retries ;radserver localhost 1812 testing123 2 1 
 It looks pretty straight forward but when I setup the "guiauth" variable to "radius" and configure the "host" and "secret" variable and try to connect to the GUI with one of my test users, I get an error 500 from the server saying that it can't handle the request.
 I've looked into my RADIUS server's logs (Cisco ISE) and I don't even see the request hitting the server.
 Am I missing something ? Also, does anyone know how to hash the secret so it doesn't appear in full text in the nedi.conf file ?
 Cheers to anyone that can help me!

I recently moved to Miami and got picked up by a very top shelf corporate company. It's one of the most sought out due to their benefits and I've heard other techs had to apply 17 times to get their jobs so I assumed I would be surrounded by the top of the top. Instead, it's been 4 months and I can confirm I'm surrounded by some of the laziest inept workers I have ever seen. No one wants to work, tickets are constantly needing to be reopened, users always complaining. Some techs even get written up several times a month but have still been with the company for 4 years because "they never fire".
 This is my first venture into Corporate IT for a large company of around 20,000 employees but I already feel like 80% of the IT department are milking checks. Is this the same across the majority of big companies like this? Should I bother staying with them if i spend more time patching up others mistakes rather than learning something new? I will admit that there are definetly career oppurtunies as most people working in IT support here are so bad my manager has considered making me a IT Tech Tier III Lead but my past jobs would have pinned me as Tier 1.5-2 in skill (fake it till you make it lol)

 The tool is installed per-user, and it sets up a couple of file associations and global hotkeys. In principle I could do all of that programmatically within the application, and simply distribute it as a standalone exe. Would an MSI/App-V/MSIX container be preferable to that?

They started having downtime on Friday, December 2nd at 2 AM and by 6 AM on Saturday had revealed that they experienced a security incident. So I immediately switched off onto a CPanel account that I have just to get my email back up and running (it was just one email address). I finally got access to the restore of my PST file. So what I have is the following at this point: 
  
An 86 GB PST file with email from 2018 to December 2nd, 2022.
 Emails form December 3rd through today that I use WHM/Cpanel to host. It's Maildir format if that helps. I use Thunderbird to check it.
  
What I'd like to wind up with is getting onto Office 365 and import the PST file. That should be straightforward. However, how can I take the email from December 3rd until now and get that into Office 365? Perhaps I could setup a separate Outlook account with IMAP that pulls from my CPanel mail account and then just drag the emails from IMAP into my new Office 365 account?
 Or does anyone else have a suggestion on how I could accomplish this?
 Thanks,
 John

We have created a new baseline using the template for Server 2022 and was wondering if that can be used in a GPO to apply to the OU containing servers of various versions? The documentation states it can be used for Server 2022 and lower versions but do I need to apply a new GPO using the template specific to each OS and if so, how is that accomplished?

 Been a reader of this group for a long time and first time posting. Just looking for others that are in a similar situation as I am and how the F&*k you do it.
 A little about my situation: I’m a one-man IT shop. We have three main offices and a few satellite offices all connected through Meraki VPN tunnels. We have just over 400 employees/contractors.
 On-Site I have two Dell SAN’s, one for production and one for on-site backup. Seven ESXi hosts and ~33 Cisco switches. Cisco CUCM VoIP system and ~90 VM’s. A Synology for off-site backup.
 In the two other offices I have Dell R series servers, one for back up and one for production.
 Now down to the “meat and potatoes”. I do it all from on-boarding to off-boarding to keeping all the hosts, VM’s, switches and other hardware updated. I babysit employees/contractors everyday with the stupid things you read on here every day. I work 60-80 hours a week. In 2022 I worked every holiday there was. I used 7 hours of PTO time the whole year. I’m 59 years old and I’m tired. The kind of tired you can’t sleep off. (what is sleep?)
 Management refuses to let me hire someone experienced to help. (they let me hire a 17 y/o intern about a year ago) but he didn’t last.
 I make a little over $100K with a $13K bonus in 2022. There’s a ton more but that’s the gist of it.
 Opinions? Comments? Am I just plain stupid for putting up with this crap?

 I have recently been deploying some new Juniper route reflectors in order to replace some aging Cisco ones in our network. Our route reflector clients are a mixture of various Cisco and Juniper routers which provide both L2 and L3 VPN services.
 When migrating some of the Cisco clients I have come across an issue where the Juniper route reflectors were not reflecting VPLS autodiscover prefixes to the Cisco clients. On further investigation we found that the route reflectors were not advertising the VPLS AD prefixes as the Cisco devices were never sending a RT-constraint NLRI for configured VFIs using BGP autodisover but LDP signalling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've reached a point of frustration on this one because I'm so close I can taste it, but I just can't quite get the last piece, and it's pissing me off.
 Using MECM to upgrade from older versions of Windows 10 to newer ones and we've got machines with Symantec Encryption Desktop (SED) on them.
 The task sequence does the following:
  
Stages SED files needed for whole disk encryption admin account to do its job.
 Copies files from above to admin account's profile
 Enables SED bypass. (pgpwde --add-bypass --disk 0 --count 6 --aa)
 Copies SED reflect drivers to needed folder for use during upgrade
 Create variable OSDSetupAdditionalUpgradeOptions to include the above reflect drivers
 Upgrade to newer version of Windows 10
 Restart computer
 Re-register the SED password filter
 Disable SED bypass (pgpwde --remove-bypass --aa)
 Reboot
 Decrypt SED encrypted drive (pgpwde --decrypt --disk 0 --aa --all)
 Uninstall SED
 The sequence goes on, but the above is the pertinent bits.
  
The issue I'm having is that the "pgpwde --remove-bypass -aa" command is failing after the upgrade.
 The error I'm getting is -11977 Improper Initialization, which I can only find one reference when Googling, which is: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=f100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427&CommunityKey=8deae12f-88a6-4d88-9186-231c4ca171d7&tab=digestviewer#bmf100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427
 Which references Linux.
 The removal of the bypass only fails before a user logs in. Once a user has logged onto the machine, and back off again, then the bypass can be removed.
 So, my thought process is that, perhaps, SED isn't sully started when Windows starts, resulting in a weird state where the commands won't run until SED finishes starting, but I'm not sure SED's underlying mechanics enough to remediate this.
 It's also an older version of SED, like 10.4 or something.

 Our solution was to install Office 2019 with Project 2019 and then the project files from the network shares open normally in 2~5 seconds.
 Did you expierence something similar with MS Project and network shares? What was your solution?

 They'd like to have an overview what is available, pre-book for visiting clients and obviously for people who are in the office.
 It'd be great if some of you could share your experience in tackling this problem.
 My original approach would be to go with a shared outlook calendar for each parking spot, but maybe there are kickass SaaS tools or even open-source solutions for this problem?
 Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I blocked most if not all file sharing websites such as Onedrive, Google Drive and and so on to avoid receiving ransomwares (we used to receive random "hey, here's the file you requested" spoofing mails with a malicious link on onedrive mainly) so people have to ask me before they can access any link, unless it's a trusted source such as the client's own sharepoint. 
 The obvious problem is that I have to weekly authorize some websites because our clients use them some times. Everytime, I connect to our fortigate and change the web filtering exceptions.
 My question is : what is your approach regarding this, and is there a more streamlined way to do this ? Do you think it makes sense to block all sharing websites (we have our own hosted solution for sharing things, but some clients use their own and sometimes we simply cannot ask to reupload something they just sent us) ?
 I'm running on Fortigate and I don't know any internal tool that can do that, but maybe I'm wrong ? 
 I wish there was some sort of Outlook addin with fortinet where I can select a link and authorize it for a short period without having to connect to the FW directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our organization is currently using a local Active Directory (AD) to manage user identities and resources, but we're interested in exploring a hybrid Azure AD solution. We want to take advantage of the benefits of cloud-based identity management while still maintaining our on-premises infrastructure. However, we're new to Azure AD and aren't sure where to start. 
 What are some best practices or tips for upgrading a local AD to a hybrid Azure AD environment? And what challenges should we be prepared for during the transition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being on site, an half hour ago, I've remotely updated the Windows OS of my jumpbox that is upstair in my server room. 
 Restarted the machine and it disappear from the network.
 No ping answer, no nslook resolution, no remote wake up answer. Times goes on... Nothing...
 My mind instantly start to think to corrupted Active Directory, corrupted DNS, DHCP problems, duplicated hostname or SID or ip with consequent network disruption ...
 ... things that are not really happening in my network since 20 years...
 I run to the server room and saw the PC looks turned on. So I turned on the monitor just to see a veeam recovery menu showing on the monitor. Then I noticed an usb key plugged in.
 I've plugged that key a couple of days before for burning a Linux ISO on it and I have completely forgotten it because I was called for another task.
 So, removing the usb and restarting the system solved all the problems.
 ​
 The fact is that everytime something happens I start thinking to the worst nightmare. And I think that's not really healthy for me. Or for troubleshooting things.
 ​
 I think also that this mindset is a consequence of this work. If you experienced something like that in the past you know what I'm talking about. You cannot forget.
 ​
 But I think this is totally unealthy and an insane mindset.
 ​
 Perhaps it is part of a impostor syndrome cause you know, this world is so big, for a One Man Show that must know everything (in no time).
 ​
 In any case, just to say, is it just me or also you have this insane way of thinking?

which clients supports DoT and which not (the ones you know like Windows, cisco devices, linux servers)
 For now both Standart DNS and DoT should be available, because disabling standart DNS may cause some clients fail to query?
 when client supports DoT, it acts like 1) check if DoT/DoH supported use them otherwise use standart UDP DNS? or how clients knows which protocol to use for communication

 ​
 In the next 2 weeks I have my final exam and I thought about building a Hyper-V-Cluster (2 Servers) with one SAN as the storage. Now the storage makes some problems and I was thinking I just take another server and build up a iSCSI-Storage-Target with the 2 Hyper-V Servers as Initiators, sadly this also won't work because that isn't the purpose of iSCSI... (just one iSCSI-Initiator possible)
 ​
 Is there like a workaround? I was thinking about building 2 iSCSI LUN's and synchronise those somehow, is this possible?

 I'm interested in knowing your overall satisfaction with Fortinet SD-WAN. What are the things you like about it? Are there any areas that could be improved?
 Looking back on your past experiences, is there anything you would do differently if given the chance?
 In addition, I'm curious to know the architecture you have implemented (FGCP/FGSP) on both Branch and Hub sites, as well as whether you have implemented Internet Breakout and how security was handled ?
 I look forward to your insights, which I'm sure will be invaluable not just to me, but also to others in the networking community. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone had any luck trying to use Clearpass for returning DPSKs to a Ruckus controller?
 It's one of those things that would be relatively easy on a more open platform, but looks impossible on a locked-down appliance like Clearpass.
 Clearpass certainly supports the MAC auth that the Ruckus uses in External DPSK mode. And it has no problem in returning Ruckus VSA 142 that should contain a modified version of each PSK. The problem is in storing the PSKs.
 As per the Ruckus docoumentation for the DPSK format, Clearpass would have to be able to use one of the SHA1 key derivation functions and then store a byte array based on a combination of the SSID and the PSK. Let's assume the PSK is admin-assigned, not generated for each client by Clearpass. The natural place to store a DPSK would be a custom dictionary attribute in the Endpoints repository, however, these do not support byte arrays, nor do they provide any access to basic functions. In this case the required function is definitely available to the underlying system as Clearpass uses it for hashing admin user passwords. In any case since the DPSK format is zero-padded a string field cannot be used instead.
 Anyway, I figured it worth asking if anyone had found a solution.

 Was hoping someone may know this. I am busy writing some scripts in Python, one in particular is to SNMP into a switch and basically gather ARP tables as I need to Mac Address and IP Address to run NMAP scans. 
 I did a SNMP walk of a switch just to see the information it has. I came across fields that I want to extract which is easy. So my question is:
 1) I cannot seem to find how to corrolate the port number to the mac address/IP address of the device. I was hoping someone may know? I tried doing Ctrl + F on ifIndex, IP, Mac Address and VLAN but couldn't find the corrolation.
 2) Which OID should I use if I run this across chassis based switches aswell? Which will be most reliable to use? - ipNetToMediaIfIndex, ipNetToMediaPhysAddress, ipNetToMediaNetAddress or ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress?
 SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: DUMMY-SWITCH-NAME
 IF-MIB::ifName.1001 = STRING: 1/1/1

 You may look above and say "Well who uses Alcatel Lucent", I say "Dont worry, I ask myself the same question every day".
 Also mac address above is random, so dont worry! I aim to run this across core switches or who knows, I could even run this across the odd 400 switches we have depending. 
 Hope it makes sense. Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently setup a new network and firewall configuration and one of the major changes we made was to restrict outgoing traffic to specific ports. Tonight I noticed a number of firewall entries that I have not noticed before and I was wondering if the basic logging would give any indication as to what might be happening here. The firewall itself is a cisco asa 5506, I will be looking at ways to capture the traffic in these conditions, but thought I would ask here as well. 
 The server in question does have an incoming ACL on port 443, it also has an outgoing ACL on port 443. 
 The log entry is this; 
 Feb 21 22:59:06 GMT/BST: %ASA-session-3-106100: access-list RS-DMZ_access_in denied tcp RS-DMZ/192.168.51.11(443) -> outside/x.x.x.x(57492) hit-cnt 1 first hit [0xdc286a6b, 0x00000000]
 ​
 The interesting thing to me is that is originating from port 443 and going to a random port externally. 
 Could this be some kind of http keepalive or poll? 
 We have had no reports from the operations team as to things not working, so I can only guess the impact of the block is nothing worth worrying about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to migrate an ASA-5506X from FMC to FDM for device management. After reading documentation and cisco community articles, this process seems easy and requires no downtime, reboot, or configuration loss.
 Documentation shows that the following lines need to be entered on the box :
 **entered after device has been removed from FMC**
 # configure manager delete
 # configure manager local
 This process seems very straightforward; however, this firewall is remote to me, so I wanted to see if anyone has had the same experience running the same migration before I migrate this device myself.Thanks again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in education (high school), and I am planning to pitch a somewhat more stern approach to certain IT practices to senior management soon; in particular, I would like everyone to start using a password manager that is freely provided on every school device, to eliminate things like constant password forgetting for our various services, passwords written on post-its stuck on monitors, etc.
 I am wondering what kinds of sanctions, if any, your companies apply to 'offenders', especially serial ones, who do not follow company policy even after training has been given.
 For example, if employees have agreed as part of an AUP to use the password manager to store their passwords, but you still catch post-its lying around or they still come to you with "I forgot my password", and when you challenge it you get "oh no I am not using that password manager thing"... are there any kinds of sanctions? Disciplinary mentions on their file? Formal warnings? A stern talking to by someone senior?
 I'd just like to see what's out there, to pitch the right ideas to my senior team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiring managers are biased to choose people closer to their own age, whether it be older OR younger. Are these unique experiences I've had, or is it true for everyone?
 I am definitely on the younger side of this sysadmin thing, in my mid 20s. I do not have as much experience as some of you folks but am definitely qualified for the roles I've been interviewed for and while I'm not the best interviewee in the world, I feel I'm decent enough.
 I'm just starting my third tech/sysadmin role. I've probably had 6 or 7 interviews that have gotten to or near the final stage in this field between all of these roles. For every role I have ended up getting, my direct manager has been quite young for someone in their position, somewhere in their 20s for all of them. These aren't even interviews that I feel I've done particularly well in. In fact, I feel some of them were quite bad, worse than ones I have failed.
 However, I notice the opposite with deciders who are a generation or two older than me. Many of them more than double my age. In these interviews, I have come out feeling like I nailed every question and left no room for questioning, but still find out they have chosen the other candidate or did not choose me for hire. From my personal experiences it just seems so blatant and honestly the largest factor in the interview process. Has anyone else experienced this as an interviewee or interviewer, or have I just had some unlucky experiences?

 But the situation I'm up against is we have a trans woman who doesn't want to see her dead name anymore. I'm trying to accomplish this for her, but I'm up against a few factors that are making it a little irritating to deal with.
 So for example, cached exchange mode. Even after telling it to download the offline address book again, the name doesn't properly update. And Exchange and Teams admin centers, new name shows up when referencing the online GAL, but client-side the old name and new name often show up at the same time depending on which viewport you're opening.
 Am I gonna have to nuke offline OABs and force cache resets?
 And this does seem like a lot of unnecessary effort, but it is a very important and personal issue to her and I'd like to accommodate her wishes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use Chrome Enterprise across the board as our default browser and I've been pretty happy with it and with the GPO controls you can apply to it so far. But I recently read that Chrome is enabling their "memory saver" feature by default. 
 Memory saver discards the content of your background tabs after a "certain amount of time" then reloads the tab when you switch back. This has some potential to cause problems in our environment where people use tabs to go back and forth between sites for data lookup/entry and have text entered but not saved.
 There are ways to manually disable it from the UI, but I have yet to find a GPO rule that will turn it off. I downloaded the newest ADMX templates and skimmed them, but didn't see it listed. 
 Does anyone know a good way to disable this across the board without relying on user interaction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to find the answer to Nexus VPC peer-gateway without HSRP behavior for some time on the internet now to no avail. 
 VPC peer-gateway installs the other switch's mac in the mac table as GATEWAY so there wont be any unnecessary forwarding on the Peer-Link but in all documents it is paired with FHRP. What happens if I set the same IP address (Gateway for downstream server/router) under the SVI on both switches and enable Peer-Gateway without configuring FHRP? Just a duplicate IP address and Peer-Gateway.
 ​
 This is a long story, I'm not a fan of this since you can run HSRP on a private IP range and set a single IP from a public range as gateway for clients under the HSRP virtual IP but for some unknown reason my boss is pushing for the first option and I'm not sure what's going to break under such circumstances.
 ​
 Any input is appreciated I'm hoping to convince the boss to go for the sane method but need some better understanding first and demonstrate what negative effects it can have. Maybe it's going to work flawlessly and I just don't know about it but he is not giving me any reference to back up this solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I'm in the process of setting up the Firewall as the place where routing happens so I can do inter-VLAN inspection. See previous post. I have a Palo alto 450 connected to a Cisco 9200.
 Historically our core has been connected to a firewall via a Layer 3 connection with an IP address. 172.16.0.1(firewall) > 172.16.0.2 (Core). There are static routes on both devices that list those IPs as the next hops. 
 I'm trying to get the VLAN information and routing up to the firewall, and in order to do that I need to make a trunk connection rather than an access connection. But trunk connections don't have layer 3 IP addresses, so if I convert my access connection to trunk, I'll lose my IP addresses. But then my static route won't know where to go. 
 I'm sorry, I feel like I'm missing something very obvious here. How do I do inter-vlan routing on a firewall and still have the core switch know how to get traffic from the access switches up to the firewall?

 Hello everyone, a few months back i was promoted to IT Manager (i started as HelpDesk L1 and then as an IT Analyst; also i work in a hotel).
 The thing is that i really feel like i don't belong yet to this position, since i don't know much about Networking (I know how to configure Switches, Firewalls, Routers, AP but just the basics), Azure or AD (i don't know if it's relevant but i love to use Microsoft Power Automate).
 So any advice or tip you can give me it would be great!
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: Thank you again all of you for your responses, i'm thinking that is not what i really want, i think i would like to be like a Sys Admin or Sys Manager)

 We have switches that have uncovered empty SFP slots (I know, bad, bad, inherited environment) that have been running for several years. I now need to install an SFP module into one of said switches but I am unsure of the safest way to ensure the port is clean. The problem is the switch cannot be turned off, way too important unfortunately. My worry is possible shorts while disturbing any dust during cleaning.
 Initial thought is to use canned air in the slot. Are there any dangers that could arise from using canned air in the slot? Please let me know what you recommend.

 P.S. We are looking into dust caps for the ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like this is rolling out to their servers currently, full changelog here:
 https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u3k-release-notes.html#esxi-7-0u3k-21313628-standard-resolved
 Direct links for anyone who needs them can be found here:
 https://esxi-patches.v-front.de/ESXi-7.0.0.html
 Obviously this only fixes ESXi 7, 8.0 isn't affected and 6.7 is now out of support so if you are still on that you will need to disable secure boot as the only workaround.

I've taken CCNA level courses, and have a decent understanding of basic network theory. Now, I work in higher-ed and I've been here 3 years in a role that focuses more on server deployment and maintenance, vSphere management, and application deployment, NOT in networking. 
 The first week I started (January 2020) I noticed how lackluster and unpredictable the Wi-Fi was on my phone. We have 4 SSIDs, a hidden one, a guest one, a staff one, and a student one. Guest is open, and the hidden SSID is for MDM deployed devices (WPA2-PSK). Staff/Student is 802.1x with user login. They all land on the same VLAN...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in a small-mid business as the IT technician and we outsource some of the upgrades which we have done. One of which is coming up due no longer being able to get support or licences for the Watchguard M200.
 We are having to look at upgrading possibly part of this setup or all of it as part of a refresh due to this and preventative in case of failure of the hardware since its over 6 years old. (before my time). We have no choice but to upgrade the Watchguard m200 since the licensing which we just renewed Jan 2023 (paid for one year) but only can get it till end of June this year.
 We have been quoted by the company which we outsource some of this the Meraki kit from cisco. 
 The MX105 to replace the router/firewall which is currently a Watchguard M200.
 MS120-48FP in place of the two HPE switches and 
 MR44 to replace the ubiquity wifi access points.
 ​
 However from the research I have done, it feels quite overkill. We have about 40-50 employees in the office and 100 others working on phones remotely (which don't need to really connect to the office network). Only users which need to VPN access to the office network is about 10-20 users.
 ​
 I'm Torn between the two options (open to other options), 
  
Replace only the Watchguard M200 with the latest equivalent and upgrade the controller for the AP's to a more reliable one. 
 Follow the recommendation but possibly with a MX75 instead of a MX105.
  
One thing that does confuse me is whether some of the security features are tied to licences (advanced security, enterprise or SD-WAN) or to the devices. Features such as content filtering and web search filtering and intrusion protection. 
 What they quoted us came to about £27,000 for kit and licences for 3 years. I'm quite new to this could use some advice

 They also have a few POE devices (Unifi AP and cameras) and could benefit from a POE switch.
 Thanks in advance.

 Edit: You’re guys are awesome. Thank you so much for all the awesome suggestions. He likes the 48 Unifi POE with the 24 port as a backup. Will be configuring a VLAN for Guest Wi-Fi and one for the security cameras.

 It works after removing site ip from iplisten list and adding it back. Not sure why it stops after a restart. any specific services need to be running ? I checked for iis admin service and .net tcp listener service are in running state. 
 When this issue happen I look for site ip given in IIS manager under site bindings of that url that is not working and I run below commands
 Netsh http delete iplisten ip address 
 And 
 Netsh http add iplisten ip address 
 In 2 or 3 minutes site will be up. But not sure what is causing it not to work after restart. 
 Above steps need to be done repeatedly whenever there is a server restart and we are getting many tickets especially due to this issue.
 Kindly let me know if any links or sources to correct this issue. I am newbie to managing servers and still in learning phase. Appreciate any inputs on this

My understanding, then, is that basically the only way to open a 1Password encrypted vault is to be on a device that has already been authorized and have your user password. 
 So what's to stop an attacker from using a keylogger to get your user password, and then gaining remote control of your device and just logging into it? Is this just a "secure your workstation better, dummy" kinds of situations?

 I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?
 I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was "what are we fixing today". And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. 
 Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking "what is going to break today", and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.
 I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office. I dont think that they will let me go because they do love what i have done, but the anxiety side of me worries that if they dont see me actively doing something, they will think im not doing anything, and given nothing is breaking to fix, im no longer needed.

 I am developing a product for multiple clients, and that product is going to be running on the cloud as a SaaS. The product focuses on analysing the client's private security cameras, so the idea is that the client simply puts the IP of the camera and my product starts picking up the feed. In these situations most of clients have their cameras in a private network and so just by having the IP won't do any good. What would the simplest way for the client to allow my product to have access to that private network so it can access the camera feed ?

 I've got a problem with my dc here. I'm in the process of migrating a ton of VMs to another esxi host that is configured identically to the one it was on before.
 One of these VMs is a domain controller for my little experiments here. All machines get their IP config from a dhcp like this: host { hardware ethernet aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa; fixed-address dc.test }
 this works fine but now after migration I can't reach anything with the DC and vice versa. I see the DC asking for ip-configs on the dhcp-server and it does configure itself with the info obtained, but it stays unreachable. 
 tried this windows tool to troubleshoot it lol, it say the problem is that the gateway is unreachable (no shit sherlock) so as I think everything is configured correctly and should just work like with all the linux VMs i moved, i thought I'd ask here.
 Any ideas whats wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey hey, Does anyone have experience with using external 4G/5G antennas with their routers? I have a use case where a mobile router needs to be placed in a basement, approx. 10-15m away from a place with sufficient mobile signal. Is there an antenna with such cable length that would work? 
 Router/antenna recommendations appreciated.
 I was also thinking about getting a rigid poe-powered 4G router (btw, 5G is not a must) and placing it where the signal is available. The place is a ventilation pipe, so withstanding weather of any season is necessary. Then, I'd only have a PoE switch and an AP in the aforementioned basement.
 I'm in Europe, btw.
 Asking for a friend.

 Looking for advice on delegating device management within an MDM world.
 Context:

We have a spin-off company (Company B) that has its own local IT team and managed about 300 devices. Company B get some services from us, such as the O365 licenses (so they user our @companyname.com email address), they previously got AV from us (see notes below) and they do their own wipe and load using their own SCCM instances that is no way connected to ours's.

 Been hitting me hard lately and putting myself down I guess but boss told me earlier that I can expect a 2k pay rise in the next coming months which all other directors happily and easily agreed to which kind of put it into perspective that I’m probably not doing that bad at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously, our staff users have had a home drive "U:" on one of our file servers. We're currently in the process of migrating these over to OneDrive for Business, but for some staff we're finding that after we've migrated them, they are sometimes not seeing all their other network drives in File Explorer on Windows 10.
 We currently map network drives using logon scripts - Group Policy Preferences would not be practical as different users need different combinations of network drives - these scripts are batch files with commands like net use v: \\SERVERNAME\SHARENAME$ /PERSISTENT:NO.
 For the vast majority of users these are working fine but for some reason, intermittently the network drives don't show up in File Explorer. We tried re-running the logon script but that said the drives were already mapped. We went to try mapping the drives using the Map Network Drive wizard in File Explorer, and we found that the wizard could actually see the network drives. This led us to discover that restarting File Explorer made the drives visible.
 We tried setting the EnableLinkedConnections registry entry (e.g. as per this ServerFault post) but this did not help.
 We tried enabling NETLOGON debug logging on computers where the incidents were reported, but the NETLOGON debug log didn't show any obvious causes.
 Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue and how we can resolve it? Other than having our users restart File Explorer every time their drives go missing?

 Solo IT officer for a medium sized org here. I need some advice on how to handle guest users in our organisation's AzureAD/InTune environment.
 I'm quite concerned about the security implications of how it is setup currently.
 Without getting into too much detail our organisation has clients that walk in off the street and use our computer lab to work on relatively confidential documents.
 Before my time our we had setup several generic user accounts for non employees to use e.g. guestuser1, guestuser2, etc.. for the guest users which is obviously is going to leave behind traces of the files and logins stored within the user profile from the previous session which is not ideal. So I need to come up with a better solution.
 Relying on staff to send new user requests for each new guest and having me to create them and assign them office licenses is just going to be way too cumbersome.
 I need something that will allow guests to login to specific PCs with just access to the web and ms office with minimal intervention from IT.
 Wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat and what they have tried.

 Python scripting (for system administration) - I have no experience (apart from scripting in general (PS))
 Terraform - I have no experience (apart from IaC in general, while using Bicep)
 Linux - yeah, no experience here too...
 Docker/K8 - still nope
  
Which one would you choose as the first step? How deep would you go? Would you go all in into Linux, for example, or just learn the basics and go on to the next one?

 My company has finally made the decision to migrate to Office 365/Exchange Online after YEARS of pushing them to undertake the project. We are currently just finishing up some of the prep work on our Exchange such as moving everything over to AD sync, migrating resource rooms etc before we start doing User Mailboxes.
 One of the questions is what's the best licensing model? We are looking at getting rid of our Anti-Virus and going with Microsoft Defender which comes standard with M365 E3 and M365 E5. My manager has decided to pitch the idea of going with a mixture of Business Standard and Premium with adding on Exchange Online Plan 2 (For some employees), InTune and Microsoft Defender license ON TOP of the business standard and premium.
 Are there any benefits that the M365 E3/E5 provide over the Business Standard and Premium if we add those extra licenses on top or would it just be smarter to go with the M365 E3 and E5?
 The manager has pitched massive cost savings but doesn't really make sense to go with Business Standard/Premium with the add on licenses opposed to just forking out the extra money for M365 E3 and E5?

 We want to use that server as backup storage now, but I'm not sure about the old disks. 
 My gut feeling is to replace them, even if it will cost some money, but I bet they're going to fail soon and I don't want to buy old rusty rotating disks again and replace them one by one.
 Maybe someone has some experience here and / or advice?

 I'm just wondering if this is normal in the day and age of 2023? Personally, I never forget my passwords and I'm quite baffled that, at least the teachers (20+ years old) forget their passwords this often.
 The younger kids may be excused in this case, but grown up people not being able to handle their passwords just strikes me as odd.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even your backups should have backups!
 Long story short - My UnRaid VM directory yeeted itself out of existence, took my backups on a hot date and just said F it.
 I went to make some changes on a VM (directly upgrading to Windows 2019 std) and had to reboot in order to accept the changes. The VM went missing - hmm that's odd - No problem! I'll just recover it from an older backup. I have a schedule of 30 days to hold backups, and they're usually overwritten when they reach 15 backups, older ones are deleted afterward.
 Those were deleted too.
 No logs.
 No errors.
 No error logs.
 No system logs.
 No alerts telling me about the missing logs.
 Nothing.
 Just an empty folder from my ~/domains/ - and no VM's in sight. I rebuilt the VM from scratch, and I'm on my merry way now. Not sure what happened - the Vendor is hopefully researching into it as it's some abnormal behavior

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 4 IT jobs I've had (Im a very technical IT middle manager), 3/4 Heads/Directors/CIOs of IT have had absolutely no technical ability whatsoever, they dont even know what Azure or Active Directory is. This applies to both the dev/sysadmin sides of IT.
 I've only had 1 IT head who was technical and had great soft skills, he we an amazing boss, we could discuss technical details at length, and he knew how to carry himself and represent us in C level meetings, he was amazing. 
 Why is it that only IT has this issue? Our CFO knows all about the ins and outs of budgets/cashflow and is very knowledge in his field. Our Head of HR knows all about policies etc. Our C level exec of law is VERY knowledge in law.
 Its not just past jobs either, you wouldnt hire a head of medical surgery that had no idea how to perform any surgery. You wouldnt hire head chef who couldnt cook. Imagine hiring a head of Marketing or Sales who had little to no idea about marketing or sales.
 I'm not saying you need to be hyper technical about IT to be a CIO, but you at least have to be good at it in some capacity in ADDITION to have good soft, management and leadership skills (just like any other C level position). I'm not advocating hiring a technical person who has crap soft skills btw. 
 Is it just that finding someone who is technical and has the above skills is to hard to find in IT? So they just hire non technical people to run IT departments because thats all their is in the talent pool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been checking out the DPVS project as of recently and some of the layer 4 features seem like they could do quite well for implementing a stateful firewall I could control from a database I can interface with. I have a few machines that each have IPs on my subnet for each application I'm running and a distribution layer switch. 
 I want to use Bird for announcing my ASN and advertising my unicast subnet (potentially AnyTun package might be used for applications to have lower latency to Europe in the future) and if possible manage to implement /arouteserver for peering with cloud providers which I access frequently to lower IP transit costs. 
 Since I have no upstream to filter traffic I would be verifying on my own and forwarding to my switch the traffic and letting it manage IPs to destinations to leverage its switching capacity for when my machines will intermingle with each others' applications instead of using up the capacity on my Linux entry and BGP machine. 
 I apologize for my limited networking knowledge when it comes to design and architecture, but I have the feeling that a software based router would be the best in this scenario, if you guys have any advice for DPDK based open source projects I could leverage or implementing a firewall that could handle reasonable PPS with efficiency on a 2x40Gb/s NIC and 7950x consumer high IPC processor I would be grateful and massively appreciative.

 Its been just over a month and I think I need to pull the plug. The last month has had me at the brink of burn out with basically doing both of our jobs and trying to train them as well. I can see things are not sinking in and can out right see them not paying attention during training sessions.
 I feel it would be easier going back to solo and looking for a replacement, but does this all seem too soon, or I'm asking/expecting too much? 
 Expectations were I could assign them switch configuration tasks and they could handle them no problem, as long as proper documentation was provided. It was provided and they seem utterly lost, and I've ended up essentially doing the work.

 AND, the last section is "Upstreams", so is that referring to the ISPs that my ISP is the customer of? 
 e.g the upstream ISPs advertise their routing tables for my ISP so my ISP can route through them. (my ISP obviously has to pay to them right?)

 Our main office currently has a pair of 6807XL's in VSS, someday we'll need to replace them. Seems Cisco bumped the EOL by a few years due to supply chain issues, but the topic of lifecycle came up recently. The long story short is: We're not sure we need a chassis platform for this office, but Cisco obviously wants to upsell us and immediately flipped shit when we brought up the idea of running our "data center" off a stack of 9300X's. 
 I use the term "data center" sparingly since there is no Nexus, fabric, routing protocols, VXLAN, etc. happening. We've got less than a hundred 1G copper and about a dozen 10G fiber ports lit at the moment, a chunk of the copper is MGMT interfaces. …]]></summary>

 I have this cenario:
 vWLC --> core sw --> dist sw --> acess sw --> 12xAP's 1852 --> SSID <-- AP's2852 WGB <-- siemens PLC <-- moving car.
 the siemens PLC is a passive client with a fixed ip, because we use a virtual WLC i can't activate the passive client option, so there is no arp resquest reaching the PLC, so from time to time the arp cache in the switches gets cleaned and lost connectivity. As a workaround, I created a simple pyhton script that goes into WGB and pings the PLC to generate some traffic, but I need a more professional solution. Do you guys have any suggestion to this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These things are driving me nuts. I inherited a shit show. No professional site survey before AP deployment. Have multiple zones, that my predecessor installed where apparently one new AP can do the coverage of two old APs. Laptops and mobile work stations do fine with roaming and connectivity. Using Ascom i63 phones with Ruckus R730s, SmartZone as the controller. Phones are on 5Ghz band. Phones register with the pbx. User complaints are poor roaming and "ghost calls" where the phones will ring to a bridged extension but I assume packets arrive late due to high latency (they rarely go over 50ms on the AP) and the phone rings but caller not on the other end.
 Followed the interrop report from Ruckus/Ascom to set up the WLAN. The client settings and WLAN are exactly like the interop report. Doing wireshark traces does not reveal the problem. Did several Ascom log traces and when I caught the problem, notify Ascom and apparenly we do not have some super duper special docking station which allows me to view the log file. Absolutely livid about that. Getting no real help from Ascom other than they want more Omnipeek traces. 
 I have been concentrating on one zone at a time. I got them to work better in two zones just by moving the APs further away from each other or deleting one or two. I do my own Netspot surveys and do not find coverage to be the issue. I am thinking more that co channel interference is the big issue here however neither company can point out exactly what the issue is. Does anyone have experience with this? It's the no professional site survey isn't it?

 I am seeking ways to enhance the overall security of our SSL VPN by limiting access to only corporate laptops. We have Sophos UTM9 Firewall.
 I am considering the option of utilizing SSL VPN with a Certificate. However, I am uncertain about how to configure it. Currently, we have RADIUS authentication with AD and Duo 2FA.
 Moreover, I am concerned about the possibility of the certificate being exported by end-users, which would enable them to import it into other devices and undermine our efforts to limit access to corporate laptops. 
 Would it be necessary to implement NPS to achieve this? If yes, how can I configure it?
 I am open to considering other quick solutions. 
 Any help or insights on how to accomplish this would be greatly appreciated.

 You know, I used to be up on the Windows server releases. Used to, because I can't remember the last time I deployed an app on Windows. Everything is RHEL now. We even deploy MS SQL Server on Linux these days.
 Has anyone gone all Mac or all Linux on the desktop?

 I work at a small (<15 employees) controls engineering firm. I was originally hired to design SCADA HMI screens and the database backends that collected data. As such as I was really familiar with python (jython 2.5./2.7) which is the scripting language of our SCADA software of choice and SQL. These two topics I am very comfortable with and would rate myself as above-average or better at.
 As time has gone on I have been exposed to certain network concepts just for deployment of our SCADA systems - IP addressing, firewalls, subnets, and working with Active Directories but just as a means of getting a user source for our SCADA projects, however it was all very surface level, and I only ever learned "just enough" to get things working.

 So I am looking to set up a network for an industrial application. I will do my best to explain the intended architecture, but fee offer suggestions on this point as well. Starting off, there will be a layer 3 switch capable of inter-VLAN routing. I plan to assign a specific VLAN ID and IP Address to each port. Connected to each port will be a machine consisting of 3-4 lightly managed switches (addresses in the same subnet as the VLAN with the VLANs IP Address as the gateway). Connected to the lightly managed switches will be 40-60 Ethernet/IP devices, including a PLC and, on some machines, a PC.…]]></summary>

 After nearly 20 years of doing this, and recently starting a new role at a new company, I made a rookie mistake by misreading/interpreting a report, and thus making a change that essentially affected nearly 3,000 users in a negative way. I'm probably beating myself up more than I think my superiors are, or will. Regardless, I feel like crap about it, feel like a failure, and need to get out of my own head to move forward.
 This is going to be a long week.
 Edit: Wow, this blew up more than I expected it to. No possible way I can respond to everyone, so I just wanted to say... Thanks! As per usual, you guys are awesome! Good news is since I no longer work in a toxic work environment, I bounced back way quicker than I ever expected to. Was back on track (physically, emotionally, and mentally) pretty much by lunchtime. Issue was resolved and just trucking forward on the next item!

 With that being said, I wanted to ask anyone who has experience with using Microsoft 365 accounts to sign into Windows, does it work well? It seems like it would give the same benefits that a roaming profile would, but I don't have enough experience with it to start rolling it out confidently. Any issues that you ran into when using the Microsoft 365 account over a domain account? Any benefits that stood out after the fact? Any advice would be appreciated!

I have my concerns - if someone hacks a personal email account that puts the internal recipients at risk of receiving a malicious email, and I've expressed these concerns. They still want me to find a way. 
 If I do move forward with it - is there a overall setting that will allow personal emails to come through? Or do I need to mark each sender as safe, as they come in. Maybe the second approach is safest. What available options do I have?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello altogether,
 I'd like to tell you something about task on going and I am stuck therefore I am searching for new creative ideas in this topic.
 --
 Background story: We currently use Office 2016 for Blue collar workers where they use shared-devices in order to edit documents, review or save them. Basically what a white collar does just with a M365 E3 License. However Microsoft has announced that Office 2016 and below is ending support for M365 Connectivity services - that's where the problem begins.
 Cause: Microsoft announced that Office 2016 will be dismissed with supporting connections to M365-Services like SharePoint and OneDrive. (See: Office versions and connectivity to Microsoft 365 services - Deploy Office | Microsoft Learn )
 Issue: Solution would be easy to convert everybody to M365 licenses but with almost 7500 BCs it will be way too expensive and cannot justified against management to have such an rise of expenses for licensing.
 Idea: Then I though, hey let's enable Viewer Mode for M365 products such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They can view but cannot edit them. If they need to edit documents they can use Word Online and we are going to assign them M365 F3. 
 But there is the next issue which comes with it:
 They cannot access any network shared files where all the local files are located today. Then they need to manually open OneDrive for Business and Word Online everytime and upload the files which they wanna use, save, download and upload it to the network sahre. This won't work since conflict risk is pretty high at that amount of users.
 This is not a great solution and I am out of ideas since Microsoft does not provide any further information. Before I create a ticket at Microsoft I'd like to ask the community whether you have any ideas and if you may experience the same issue in your company?
 Thanks in advance!

Our change management team have apparently renamed themselves "CMaaS" - Change Management as a Service. They have a very nice wiki and a lot of written processes, but none of these team members are scalable virtual machine clusters, as far as I'm aware. Seems sooo weird (at best) to appropriate a defined, if buzzwordy, naming convention. We have a number of weird "aaS" named services which are in now way fitting that model, but now we can apply it to actual people? Way to devalue a concept, right?

 The problem is, we can only buy software on account, but systracer is not available with this payment option.
 I am aware of Regshot (advanced), but it can only track registry changes, not filesystem changes. Also compare multiple steps is not really possible.
 ​
 I would be thankful for any recommendations for alternatives (either for file system changes or registry changes, but in best case something that can do both)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had no idea where to ask this so apologies in advance if I'm in the wrong place and if I get the terminology wrong (I almost definitely will)
 Long story short: I have been stalked by someone for years and no matter how many times I make sure my accounts are secured with two factor etc, they always seem to know the most specific information about me. Where I bought dresses I wear in Facebook photos, where I've booked a dinner reservation etc. In addition to this, I keep being subscribed to newsletters I don't remember signing up to. A lot of these required confirmation and the confirmation emails are nowhere to be seen in my inbox 
 Other than a public profile picture, all of my socials are incredibly secure and have been for some time due to the ongoing nature of this behaviour. 
 I thought maybe my emails were being forwarded but I've found no evidence of this (I use gmail and have multiple accounts). Tonight I was having another look around my gmail settings and I saw that my IMAP is turned on. I dont understand IMAP or POP but my understanding is, IMAP allows my gmail to be synced with a different mailbox and all changes (including deletions) are synced. 
 I'm of the belief this is how my stalker is doing it, but as this is an ongoing investigation with the police (there is a court order in place). I want to get any sort of IP information before I just switch it off. 
 Is there a way to do this? Am I understanding all of this correctly? Do any of you have any other ideas? It's been going on for so long and most police I talk to are tech illiterate haha.
 Apologies for the long post and thank you in advance

It worked as advertised, however the new photos are not automatically displayed in Sharepoint.

 Is there any way to do this from the admin side, without requiring every single user to view his own profile? I know MS says there isn't but maybe someone came up with a creative solution.

The following types of customized settings will be overwritten when you install an Exchange CU: 
 Any customized Exchange or Internet Information Server (IIS) settings that you made in Exchange XML application configuration files on the Exchange server. For example, web.config files or the EdgeTransport.exe.config file. 
 Customizations to the operating system's TLS/Cipher settings. 
 Be sure save this information so you can easily re-apply the settings after the install. After you install the Exchange CU, you need to re-configure these settings.
  
Does anyone have or know of a script that can check for and back up all of the possible customizations that could be overwritten by an Exchange CU? Ideally only backing them up if they are changed from the default.

 One person just gets ahead and writes about the existing problem to my facebook messenger... Like what the heck? Why would you do that? If you have some mobile internet then why not write to our HelpDesk? Or at least e-mail or the messenger we use in work? Why would you write to a messenger I never use for work and is only personal? I mean I will probably just block that person over there. Or at least ignore.
 I'm sorry for this rant but I really don't get some people. Why do they want to bother us so much?
 Do you guys have similar experiences? How do you deal with it?

Then a new tech gets reassigned and same issue. I've seen some posts online requesting help from Microsoft, and same someone always comes asking for logs, and then nothing is ever heard again.
 Is this a common experience with them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know we all hate those little yellow Post-It notes with passwords, but…
 So this week my childhood best friend’s brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. He was barely fifty. The family had no idea where to start. They didn’t know if he had a will and, if so, who might be the executor. They didn’t know his financial relationships. They didn’t know his insurance policies. They didn’t know who his lawyer was. He was somewhat secretive, and they were stumped.
 What they did have was a stack of four laptops, ranging from his current laptop to plan older one circa 2004. They brought them to me to see if I could “hack” into them and glean anything that might point them in the right direction. I promised I would do what I could.
 I started with the only one that had a power adapter. I was lucky enough that the default account, “user”, had no password and had admin rights. I logged in, reset the password for his account, and started hunting. I found a few work-related documents and some photos of his kids and not much else.
 Next, I gathered all the old laptop chargers I had around and tried to fit the laptops. No luck. Where is my universal charger? ugh. Anyway, I opened one of the laptops and what comes fluttering out? A single Post-It Note. I though, “Please let this be a password”. We all know that is the main use of these damn yellow sticky papers, right? Well it wasn’t, but it was just as good. It was a list of names and phone numbers. Lawyer. Banker. Investment advisor. Insurance agent. Mortgage broker. The works.
 Anyway, thank God for little yellow notes, but I still need to get into the laptops. Anyone have any recommendations for boot sticks that might permit resetting SAM accounts, mounting file systems, etc? I used to use Trinity Rescue Kit, but that was half a career ago. I am also hoping nothing is encrypted; wish me luck.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Quick question, hopefully someone can assist, this is the first time I have properly configured STP rather than set the defaults and run, and I am not 100% sure if I should even have it enabled over the MC-LAG links for the Juniper Top of Rack or leaf switch stack.
 The link below is an example of the network layout I am configuring.
 https://imgur.com/a/B5bAy5J
 Should I disable RSTP and VSTP on the Juniper, on the MC-LAG interface to the core switch? Currently it is set up with RSTP, the MC-LAG interfaces are set to point to point and other interfaces are edge, the ICL between the stack has RSTP disabled, and it's set block BPDU on edge.
 The Cisco portion of the network has Rapid-PVST+, the core is the root bridge, the others are default, access ports are portfast, etc. basic Cisco set up really.
 I am not sure if I should disable all STP on the MC-LAG interfaces to the core and management switch, the MC-LAG stack is an aggregate switch stack, should it just pass through the BPDU packets? I believe this is what the Juniper documentation is getting at but it's a little wishy washy on that. This would basically leave Cisco to run STP on its network, and just leave the rack alone. Or do I pass through the packets and enable Rapid-PVST+ on the management switch, on the other side of the Juniper MC-LAG?
 Or should I also be setting up the Juniper MC-LAG stack to be handling the incoming BPDU packets from the Cisco? I would have to add PVST to it as well for interoperability, I am just not sure how this may affect the RSTP running locally, which was recommended to be enabled by Junipers docs.
 Any help would be much appreciated.

 But I can't simply re-use the original SAS cables: connectors are different and card are in different PCI slot (so length is not the same).
 Here are some pictures:
 Pictures 1 and 2: SAS sockets on the backplane:

 I’m in my early 30’s and 6 months ago became the lone IT guy in a medium sized business (~200 devices). I currently work with an MSP who has dropped the ball quite a few times and has long lead times. I personally feel they can’t adequately support the user base in a timely fashion. 
 Currently, I’m not unhappy with the job, but I find myself a bit bored after I got myself up to speed on the infrastructure and the security improvements that needed to be made. My job also shifts rapidly from providing level 1-3 tech support along with sys admin tasks. I find myself wanting co-workers to bounce ideas off of, but I don’t have that outlet here. I’m getting the itch to move onto something else, but I’m not sure where I want to land and how to get there. I like the sysadmin side of things and implementing sensible security policies. 
 Has anyone been in a similar position before? Where did you wind up?

Yes, i do the tech support, and I also have to document everything that happened during the call.

There is basically no ticketing system implemented, and it is really maddening when you come to think of it. What's your take on this? I'm 4 months in, and I'm already kinda burned out.

 About 4 years ago, after a security incident my company decided that AWS was the future and on-prem data center was the way of the dinosaur.
 It's that typical horror story where I have to assume something similar to the CEOs friend touted AWS while on the golf course and then issued the decree that we were going to the cloud. 3 years ago they said we'd be fully in AWS in 3 years. Migrations ground to a halt last year when a mid tier clients AWS environment blew by their annual costs to run in the DC in just 3 months at a fraction of the performance.
 Since the beginning they've been systematically promoting people who have a positive outlook on AWS and telling those who do not that they are not culturally fitting well with the company and driving the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about to embark on switchport-based network access control for a wired network.
 I have about 80 VLANs. I need NAC for about only 10 of them because they're more sensitive than the other 70.
 My environment:
 -Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices -Meraki switches (MS390) -Wired network (we aren't looking to do NAC for WiFi) -We want only device-based authentication so everyone on an authorized device can use it on that VLAN; have no use for user-based auth -Budget for this is almost $0 -We currently have an on-prem AD environment but it's gradually going away in favor of Azure AD
 If you were to do port-based NAC for devices on a few VLANs today, which solution would you use? I am currently shying away from Microsoft NPS because we are dismantling ADCS and our overall on-prem infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m part of a team at our org looking for ways to reign in our data governance policies because currently we keep and back up everything and have zero policy on what’s kept or for how long. 
 We’re also looking at a way that we can force sensitive documents to stay within a repository to prevent peaks to the outside world. For example, a financial doc that sits on our financial share shouldn’t be able to be copied off. However, our documents are so scattershot we have no idea what users have already squirreled away on their machines.
 We’re developing policy for these things now, but I’d love suggestions on tools / techniques used to enforce it. 
 Any input is very much appreciated
 Edit:
 We use Microsoft and Apple workstations, Windows and Linux servers, Google Workspaces and Office 365, On prem AD that syncs to Azure AD (so a hybrid AD environment)
 Our file servers are on prem. We have a lot of data in Google Drive and higher up’s are wanting to open up O365 for users to put docs in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apart from ansible or similar scripting tools, is there a standard way to manage ssh keys for your server? The context is when a team member leaves, I’ve no clue of their access. There’s no documentation that keeps track of it. So I need to ssh to each server and remove their key if found. First problem is keep the access documented which is already in process but apart from that is there’s anything which will help like SSO, where the identity is linked to AD and once their account is made inactive they shouldn’t be able to authenticate.
 I thought of writing a script which talks to AD server and allow/deny login using SSHCMD or something and keep it in every server but in event of AD failure it’d be impossible to login to any server. But it seems like a hack than a standard procedure.

 I know that ping TTL is unique to some devices but this is not something that always works as many vendors share the same TTL value. Are there ports usually open on a router that aren't on a PC? I suppose you could use host name too?

If my skills in an area are particularly strong I will tell them, and if they are a bit weak in other areas I'll tell them too (but of course I'll tell them that's an area I'm actively working on).
 I've stuck to honesty because I don't want to get a job that I can't do. The problem is that I then don't get much success from my interviews. 
 I have been involved in interviews and seen that a lot of candidates just lie and say they can do anything they get asked about and then come unstuck when it comes to the technical interview.
 ​
 So my question is - am I wrong for being honest? How much does everyone else embellish (or just plain lie)?

 - A user logs into wifi with their credentials (802.1x)
 - Each user is assigned a fixed subnet (a /28 in the 10 space, and a /64 in the v6 space) for their devices
 - The users would retain this block of addresses for the duration of their engagement with the organization. (Some of these users would have additional rules as well to coincide with regulatory requirements, or other reasons, these would most likely take place at the router and firewall levels) 
 I was investigating the possibility of using radius to assign a different vlan to each individual with the contained subnets, however this gets unruly assigning a different private vlan to several hundred different users. I'm wondering if there is a better solution out there someone could point me in the right direction. I'm working with Aruba hardware. 
 If someone can point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it. I'm recently reentering the network design world and discovering I'm forgetting more than I remember about this topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 Looking to learn a "cookie cutter" sort of speak network setup for small business.
 Yes... I do realize every business is different but the best way for me to learn is to have a goal and work towards meeting that requirement.
 Theoretical scope would be a small business such as a coffee shop, auto mechanic, dental office, insurance office, etc. Consisting of 10 ppl or less with computers, printers, mobile devices, 2-3 IP cameras, a file server or two, with occasional guests.
 Internet line would probably range from 200mb-1gb down and 50mb-200mb up
 My thoughts on equipment that would cover this range would be:
 ISP Modem > Router > Firewall > Switches > APs
 ISP Modem > Netgate 2100 > Unifi Switch Lite 8 POE > Unifi U6 Lite(s)
 Ive used Ubiquiti gear before so I think the POE switch and AP's would be a good fit. 
 Netgate 2100 is the router firewall VPN appliance I think I'm settling in to learn.
 Would this setup be a realistic real world configuration for a small business? 
 Ideally, I'd like to learn this and implement this into friends and family's businesses as a side hustle then expand to regular customers to grow even more.
 Thanks for your help and time!

I have a really good understanding of network fundamentals but have been out of practice now for 2 years since I got a new job more on the incident management side of things for a video game company. 
 I am looking for some resources to help me acquire the JNCIA-Junos certificate so I can make the jump to our networking department who uses mostly Juniper devices. When I was studying for my CCNA I got lucky and found a community college near me that offered a 1 year crash course to prep you for the CCNA. This included hands on labs and a ton of reading. I managed to get my CCNA after 2 tries and really enjoyed the networking job I had except for the fact that they where paying me 40k a year in Los Angeles which basically meant I was poor. 
 What I am looking for is some resources to study for the JNCIA this can include:
 Websites
 Youtube training videos
 Online paid courses
 Text books
 Anything really to help get comfortable with the Juniper command line 
 I am willing to pay for courses so anyting helps please. If anyone here has passed there JNCIA lets have a conversation. There are some oppertunities at my job for Networking but they are all for Juniper devices which I am not familiar with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm out of touch. It's been a few years (~10) since I built a new monitoring system and I'm looking for suggestions. Back in the day I had a nice Nagios setup with groundwork open source. I exposed the cgi-bin via a reverse proxy that required client certificates. Installed aNag app on my Android device and had a widget on my phone home screen. Net result was that if I (as an example) dropped a disk from my md-raid, my phone would get an active alert within 5 minutes.
 Now in 2023 I am looking to start fresh and ask for suggestions on a completely new monitoring system that meets that requirement. What will alert me within 5-10 minutes of a failed disk, to my Android phone? Active monitoring only, not something that pushes an email or something, since if that system failed, it could fail quiet. 
 All clients to be monitored are Linux and I'm only interested in free and open source tools. Right now I'm leaning towards checkmk/omd.

 SQL Service starts but remote connections over SSMS would throw this error.
 Cannot connect to SERVERNAME.
 The Target principal name is incorrect. Cannot generate SSPI conext (Microsoft SQL Server).
 I googled the error and it came down to a SPN issue. Basically the the gMSA account was unable to register SPN. I tried to register manually but AD said there was duplicate entry already.
 To finish the move to the new cluster I ended up creating an old school service account and set SQL to use it then remote connections to SSMS began working. 
 Any ideas why this gMSA didn't work. The 2 servers are in an AD group that I used when I generated the gMSA account. Any ideas, did I miss something?

 Two possible strategies for booting hosts from their assigned LUN:
  
Identical host HBA configs --they all get the same target WWPNs and target LUN ID. The pairing of each host to its designated LUN is done on the array side (i.e. each LUN is presented to only one host via export with the common LUN ID. For this project I'm using LUN zero everywhere).
 Present the basket of boot LUNs to the entire cluster of hosts; each LUN is "exported" with a unique LUN ID. Pair each host with its designated LUN by setting the appropriate target LUN ID on the host HBAs.
  
The first method strikes me as cleaner and safer. It's one less touch-point to worry about as hosts will have i…]]></summary>

 The scenario I was looking at is a restaurant that can only get one internet provider in the complex due to contracts. Main goal is to be sure POS and Alarm system still has connectivity then a few computers have basic low speeds 5mb+- to get by till the main internet line is resolved.
 Has anyone tried this or had some other cellular internet provider as fail over?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all-
 I handle networking for pro-av AVoIP applications including SDVoE and smpte 2110. These devices essentially all rely on multicasting, IGMP, and are in the realm of 10Gb to 25Gb per device/host. One issue that i've seen frequently in some courses panels in regards to switch stacking, is that by stacking switches you can quickly run into severe multicast flooding. Arista deals with this through what they call "Multi-cast Orchestration" on their own switches, and Netgear acknowledges it's an issue and says "Care should be taken" when stacking switches- however I haven't heard anyone mention how to actually prevent or stop that multicast flooding on a network without something like Arista's proprietary product. Is there a common approach to handling this I'm not aware of or some 3rd party product which can handle this? What is the "care" you would even take to prevent that form of multicast flooding? 
 The reason for the stacked switches is to achieve 100% redundancy, allow easier expandability, etc.

Each frequency has its own wavelength that it transmits off, the higher the frequency goes up, the more "aggressive" the wavelength, allowing for faster speeds again in combination with QAM etc... the lower end wireless frequencies (2.4ghz) have a "wider" wavelength, allowing for radio waves to travel further, at greatly reduced speeds and more i…]]></summary>

Black screen trying to RDP in to server
 
Services are down, and not able to open applications on servers
 
Server Manager error message at login. "This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action..."
 
Taskmgr.exe error message "No such interface supported."
 
 Which means most of business is down.
 The root cause seems to be related to file permissions changes in the GPO
 https://i.imgur.com/XQlHIEw.png
 https://i.imgur.com/Jx9ZJLI.png
 Manually restoring the permissions has been tried, but it was unsuccessful. Reverting the GPOs does not solve the issue as it does not revert the changes.
 It was supposed to go to test first. Unluckily it was applied to server OU. We'll of course take care of the administrator who did it, this is quite an unfortunate event. Is full restore the only way to go, or is it possible to fix it? Any ideas fellow sysadmins?
 Edit: The servers are not receiving updates to GPOs anymore. Any changes you do/remove/add a GPO will not be updated to any servers.
 Update from the morning of 19.02.2023: Shit guys we're deep in it, the restores are failing for some reason. Complete rebuild has been initiated while we are trying to find workarounds and get Microsoft escalation.
  
Some servers you cannot reach at all, while others you can actually get access to through management tools or run wmic.
 Domain Controllers not affected, GPO was applied to servers OU

 I was tasked with connecting my org's SSO solution to our Google domain so we could use 2FA. I thought I had set it up wrong because when I logged out and back in, there was no redirect to the SSO page; it just took my Google password as always. I did some digging and apparently the reason is that I'm a Super Admin for our domain and Google doesn't allow Super Admin accounts to use SSO (unless you're signing in from within a network mask...which I don't understand). I then tested it with multiple end user accounts, and the SSO redirect worked correctly.
 I'm confused. Wouldn't the Super Admin accounts have the biggest need for protection? These are the accounts with the highest privileges. I must be missing something here, right?
 Edit: I understand now. In my head I was thinking SSO implied 2FA, which it doesn't. You wouldn't want an admin account to be using SSO without 2FA but Google can't really enforce that without ruling out SSO altogether. I'll change the post flair. Thanks y'all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently scoping out firewall vendors for a potential replacement. Top 3 are Palo Alto, Fortinet, and Checkpoint. We have had Fortinet’s technical demo and have heard their claim that they are “best” due to a mix of value, ease of use and performance (Paralell Processing). Palo is scheduled this week to discuss why they are the best.
 our IT security team is pushing Checkpoint hard. Their basis is it’s the most secure and point to 2 things. Testing showing that they block way more attacks than all the others and a claim that there are no CVEs in the last 8 years. The first item I’m disregarding because it’s a checkpoint sponsored test comparing Physical Hardware to VMs. 
 However the second claim has me intrigued. I looked and there are really no publicly available CVEs listed for Checkpoint. With a system based so heavily on Linux and so many technical changes in the last 10 years, is it really feasible to have 0 CVEs? In my mind that is the IT version of “My shit don’t stink”. And if so, why is that platform so much more secure?
 Edit: Thanks to those who provided links. It sounds like I was right to call BS on the second claim. Much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 we are currently looking into switching to MFA through Azure AD with our Endpoint VPN solution. Everything fine so far except one part of the organization who use the VPN solution, but are not synchronized to our main Azure AD. They use their own Azure tenant.
 Synching them to ours as well (and license them) is not an option.
 I read about cross tenant access. But I don't get how I should be able to select a group from the other tenant in my Conditional Access policy for the App that controls the VPN solution.
 Do I have to look into B2B direct connect and somehow synchronize these users into our tenant? I would not want that. I tried adding a group through B2B direct connect that is allowed to access my tenant, hoping I could then select that group in CA - but it seems that's not how it works.
 Any hints appreciated - thanks!

I've gone over the configs dozens of times and everything looks perfectly fine; however, the links just will not come up.
 As an afterthought, I swapped out one of the (passive)QSFP-H40G-CU3M cables with a (active)QSFP-H40G-AOC3M cable and the link comes right up. We have 8 of the passives, as that is what Cisco sent with the BOM. Is there a config I'm missing somewhere to allow the passive cables to work? Or could it be that maybe the QSFP Microcontroller on the Nexus switches can't use the passive cables?
 The switches can see the transceivers, they just don't initialize the port.

 Greetings!
 Im a small ISP with just a lil over a gig of traffic in some isolated island somewhere in Asia. I have a contract with our local government units and department of education on improving their internet connection. I have observed that most of my network's traffic consists of google. About 40% to 50% google and another 40-50% facebook. Ive recently got my network its own ASN and public ipv4 ipv6. 
 Right now I have sent a request to google about it. Im just curious to know since on their website, it doesnt show any other requirements aside from having to have asn and ipv4 in RIR directory. 
 Does google require certain TRAFFIC to be able to qualify for GGC?
 THANKS!

 On Wednesday a vmware horizon VDI server that was stood up last week was compromised because the technicians responsible didn't install the log4j patched version of the server. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved.
 On Thursday a client's email was suspended due to breaching the terms of service of the incumbent email provider who they were still paying for service that is well below the tier of RackSpace because sales would not insist that a modern email service be used. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved. 
 I inherited the job of migrating an imap email server to m365 with an expected completion date of Friday whilst being the escalation point for 10 L1 technicians. This went as expected. 
 Last night I went home and had a panic attack. Theoretically if I cared enough about the client migration I would be working on all weekend but I don't because we were able to get the old email vendor to re-establish the account until we can migrate, I'm spending time on Indeed, Monster & Dice trying to find a life boat out of this hellhole.
 The point of this post is to never, ever, trust an MSP with your environment past the point of giving them a runbook or utilizing them for L1 helpdesk. Never give them administrator credentials. 
 If you ever think about being coerced into working for an MSP stick your hand in a rat trap, remember the pain, and realize that MSP is the hotel California of the IT profession. 
 Once you have that stink on you it's hard to get it off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone!! 
 Looking for some advice on how best I can continue my learning as well as whether I made a good choice: 
 I work as an IT Net Admin for an ISP. I have decided to take a job working for a federal contractor due to the pay increase and benefits for my family. 
 The job that I ended up taking is pretty much help desk stuff at a healthcare facility. 
 The trouble I think about is whether I made a choice that puts me back a few steps or if I've made a good choice. 
 Background:
 My current job as a net admin is pretty wtf imo. It was all good at first with my previous boss. Like I stayed within the confines of my JD but he left and now instead of being the net admin to all 3 separate departments, I'm stuck messing around trying to help 1. 
 Firstly, my boss doesn't know anything about Wi-Fi, networking and network devices. He does know voice stuff I guess? (supposedly. He basically relies on support to give him all the answers and then says it like he knew all along). 
 Secondly, I am technically supposed to resolve networking issues for the IT department as a whole, clients and most installs as well as build networks for projects but I'm too busy trying to run around and be the manager my boss isn't for 1 group that I wasn't even supposed to pay this much attention to. 
 Thirdly, I am honestly running around trying to be a dude in construction and find ways to get an install done for clients without having the company spend on contractors to do that work professionally. It's the weirdest thing ever. 
 Lastly, My JD explicitly stated I'm only supposed to be resolving network issues and build our large projects and when I bring this up I get the "I know. Thank you. You're really doing amazing." 
 There's more to the story but I'm really trying to not rattle on.

 Client has Windows 11 HP Notebooks, USB-C docks and Kyocera MFPs. KX Universal Printer Driver (v.8.3.0815).
 / Scenario A Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print, then click Print <Prints fine>
 / Scenario B Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print View Printer Properties (No changes) OK Click Print <Word hangs, doesn’t Print> [Killing Printer process makes Word resume]
 / Scenario C No Dock attached Open Microsoft Word Print View Printer Properties (No changes) OK Click Print <Prints fine>
 This can only be reproduced:
  
When the Dock is attached (whether using LAN or WiFi).
 When the Printer Properties are viewed (to change colour, tray, etc).
  
If we disconnect the Dock, use LAN, all works fine.
 We have uninstalled AV, Office Add-ins, updated drivers, Windows update etc. 
 It does work with other printers and print drivers, but the client needs the Universal Printer Driver.
 I’ve ran Procmon and can see ‘Print Isolation Host’ doing it’s thing, touching Kyocera DLLs, and have captures from successful and failed prints. Nothing jumps out.
 The fact the dock is a factor makes me think there’s some kind of conflict or memory issue. 
 Any suggestions welcomed!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m learning about event driven architecture and investigating which message broker appears to be the best fit for me.
 I was looking into Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ and found that the former has a supplementary system named Apache Connect, which essentially allows to use a bunch of third-party connectors as event sources or event sinks.
 E.g. with Kafka, if I wanted to make an event “NewUserCreated” when a new row is inserted into Postgres database’s users table, I can just use a Postgres connector and configure it as event source (haven’t tried yet actually but I understand so). With Confluent, I can configure all of this with a visual GUI.
 But with RabbitMQ, would I need to be making custom connector scripts? E.g postgres database allows webhook trigger, so I make a cloud (edge) function that connects to RabbitMQ and sends the event.
 Or is there something analogous to Apache Connect but designed for AMQP message brokers like RabbitMQ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping someone else will have come across this. Generally speaking we purchase all devices through Apple Business account so it will already be in the Apple Business Manager but every now and then there’s a need for us (or a client) to purchase directly and the. Add to ABM manually. 
 What’s winding me up is how inconsistent this experience is.
 Normally it’s as simple as switch the device on, get to the WiFi part of setup and then if fire up Apple Configurator on another iPhone that’s signed into ABM, it detects this and the new device is added to the ABM. You then need to immediately change the MDM to InTune on ABM and force an InTune to ABM sync before you allow it factory reset. It’s then hit and miss on whether or not the device will get stuck at the “obtaining configuration from org” screen. So it’s already a bit flaky even for orgs where this is about as simple as it can be (single profile for that enrollment method) but “tends” to work. 
 That’s annoying but I can live with it. What’s annoying me more is that on some new devices fresh out of the box (and old that are factory reset) they refuse to pair up at the WiFi screen, nothing happens at all. Trying to find information on troubleshooting that aspect seems impossible. Very few people using the iOS Apple Configurator App it seems. 
 Posting here in the hopes that someone else has come across the issues above and has any advice on troubleshooting either of them?

I'm thinking of leaving but I shudder when I think of the potentially toxic environments that I may get into even though the pay may improve. My country is extremely notorious for having toxic corporate environments, weak labor laws, zero percent worker protection, political infiltration, and managers that are clueless & wicked, etc such that you actually find people quitting their good-paying jobs because of toxic environments -that is what I'm contemplating getting into. My current workplace doesn't stress me, the people are civil and the processes are professional and standardized. I consider myself blessed to be formally employed in a country with a 90% unemployment rate but my salary just barely scratches the surface as compared to equally qualified and experienced counterparts in other companies.

 Is it possible to somehow re-use a selfencrypting drive secured with a tool called Wave?
 Diskpart and Mac Disk Utility could not. Both report it to be some weird smaller capacity partitions than the disk actually is. These were old corporate notebook disks.
 Any ideas? Thank you

 We have Windows 10 (going to Windows 11 shortly) Hybrid Azure AD joined devices with LAPS setup. We are working towards getting our devices into Intune but aren’t there yet. 
 Remote devices have BitLocker with a Pin setup, and we had a theft of a laptop recently and luckily the device was BitLockered with decent pin, we reset user password and revoked 365 sessions for good measure – end of IT’s involvement. Everyone in our org has MFA enforced, we have configured recommended Conditional Access policies and we generally follow best practice where we can.
 But it got me thinking, if that laptop had not had a BitLocker Pin (TPM ONLY) or the Pin was weak (or user had written it down on a post-it note in the laptop bag…….) what would the thief been able to access? They wouldn’t have been able to caddy the drive due to TPM but could they have booted off a USB utility tool (Hiren or whatever it is now) and reset the Administrator password and then logged in as local admin and had access to the local user profiles and data?
 If so, is there anyway to mitigate this? I also note that deploying devices via Intune/AutoPilot, there is no out of the box/automated way of setting a unique TPM pin which wages a debate about if pin is even necessary.

 From what I've read, L3 is the way to go, bringing the L3 down all the way to TOR or even the server. Everything is routed, small L2 domains.
 As an example, the K8s networking plugin is Calico. This is a pure L3. Given a cluster-wide IP pool of 10.20.0.0/16, it carves out a smaller subnet (like a /26 by default) and assigns it to each node.

I ordered and received a server to replace this stand-alone hyper-v host. I worked with our vendor to order the new server spec'd like our current server. I don't know where the breakdown happened (I know I screwed up), but the new server did not come with the 2 10GB (SPF+) ports. To make matters worse, there are no available slots in install a card. Before I tell my boss we spent $25K on a server that we can't use, I'd like some feedback. This server's sole use is hosting these 2 Veeam servers. The network ports I have are 1GB. How screwed am I?

 I am looking for some career advice and was thinking this would be a good place to ask.
 I’m currently a network admin, and I focus heavily on config/management of Firewalls and anything behind them for our many customers (MSP).I switched from the Voice side in the same company to the data side about 6 months ago.
 I’ve asked for raises etc, and have not been able to get past $50,000 (In Indiana, with company for 2 years)
 I enjoy and am good at SIP, and was sent a job offer as a Voice Engineer for a large provider expanding into the US, for alittle over 70% more pay.
 To me, that’s life changing money.
 However, even though i feel underpaid, i think the amount of security knowledge i gain week after week is really valuable, and i always hear people talk about trying to break into security, and it seems like i have luckily been able to do so. 
 This new role sparks my interest very much bc i do enjoy voice, but I’m worried about leaving the security space and possibly making it harder to return after my VoIP arc 
 Thanks in advance for any advice!
 Tl;Dr 
 Currently feel underpaid in network security 
 I like voice and got an offer for 70% more as a voice engineer for a large company 
 Worried about it being hard to get back into security after i do VoIP for a couple years

 Edit: It would need to run Windows Server for AD and GPOs. The CPU was selected for the potential of a VM or two.

 HDD: 1TB 7.2K RPM SATA Entry 3.5in x2 in RAID1 for the OS
 OS: Windows Server 2022 Standard
 I would upgrade the OEM RAM with a 2x16gb kit of Crucial Memory since Dell’s memory prices are crazy

Bad patch cable. When I replaced the patch cable, couldtrax said it was online and couldn't communicate. No matter how many times I disconnected the ports to shut the device off from the server closet it wouldn't work. Had to get a 20 foot ladder and unmount and reseat the cable there. Magically it started working.
 ​
 THE BIG QUESTION
 When I have something that happens with a cable with one of these access points, do I need to go directly to the access point and reseat it?
 ​
 Notes: Monitoring it before, it was in and out with connectivity, and I think this was primarily because of the patch cable.
 I didn't test the wire run from the server closet to the AP. Did a constant ping with no issues, and thus far, it's been consistent with the other 2 AP's.

 (wire goes from access point to patch panel, from patch panel to PoE port on on injector, then injector port goes to switch).

The Atoms almost always fail and require a power cycle or a complete factory reset before the update can succeed. The AP250s exhibit the same behavior, but not as often. Sometimes I do have to deactivate PoE on their backhaul ports to get them to eventually behave.
 Every AP is backhauled btw, no mesh. 
 To troubleshoot, I've consoled into a couple while this process happens, but the logs I see give no clear indication of why updates could have failed besides some vague messages about losing connectivity to the cloud.. but they're rebooting and won't have connectivity to anything. The cloud console gives no information whatsoever after a failure. In the device list, the ones that eventually fail get stuck at 12% on the progress bar... for HOURS.
 These are all legacy Aerohive devices by the way. We had these before AH was acquired by Extreme. Are we running into some kind of planned deprecation situation? The thing that bothers me is even when we were running Aerohive's Mangler, this stuff still happened, but not as bad and way less frequent.
 Is extreme/aerohive's cloud management just this bad? Or is there something wrong with how these are deployed/operating? These things are workhorses. And after tuning the hell out of the system due to a high-density/high-interference environment, users have been happy. I'm actually very impressed with the flexibility and features these things provide. But upgrading them takes half a day or more... and it clenches my butt every time.
 Thanks for reading, and thanks for any insight anyone may provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit. I am asking because I saw a few UKG posts here before in searches. 
 My multi state grocery store company has used Kronos for a long time now. My new store manager started using UKG to create weekly schedules. So our schedules went from two pages to around eight a week. I am supposed to be able to us UKG Dimensions and see my Kronos punches and schedule. Well I put in the url that my company says to put in the UKG site and app. I can see my Kronos punches fine. But it randomly shows the schedule. Never the current schedule or upcoming, but it will show what it was two weeks ago sometimes. 
 What I am wondering is... Is there a box/setting the manager has to have selected while making the UKG schedule to have it show up on the UKG Dimensions website/app? I can find no UKG help board that does not require a sort of membership to even ask them. So I thought I would try here.

 So it was very simple task. User was not receiving an email from certain email address(it is a distribution list address) in their outlook. So I wanted to forward the email coming to that email address to user's email address. 
 To do this we have to change the mailbox in OWA to the distribution list address and set forwarding settings to user's email. But some reason my brain lagged and I forwarded user's email to that address. The user called me next day saying that there are no emails /receiving email in their outlook client/OWA. I immediately knew what I did and disabled the forwarding setting and they were able to receive emails again. But emails during forwarding setting was enabled was not in their mailbox. I checked with our l2 team and they said it impossible to do anything in this case. I also did not check keep a copy during forwarding. 
 So not only I did not do my job, I created a task for user where they have to request the sender to send the emails again which is a very troublesome task depending on how many emails they received during that time. I requested user to check if the emails could be sent again yesterday. Or they have to contact the distribution list owner and send their emails back. Now I am waiting for user response and depending on their response I might lose my job. I had a panic attack and still thinking about it. How I could do such a simple mistake. I am doing help desk for 1year and never felt like this. I am not sure If we can share this here. I just wanted to share it to someone.

 We would like something that can update via wifi to show if the room is in use or not but which does not require constant recharging like the usual scheduler iPads and tablets do.
 Even the union electrical and AV guys who helped us configure the space did not have a great cost effective solution. So I wanted to see if one of you had found a good workaround for this already so we don't have to reinvent the wheel for no good reason.

 I am somewhat the sole operator of a virtual production LED studio. I've been tasked with a lot of tech that I do understand and some I don't mostly related to server networking & ability to send data wirelessly. 
 We will start with the wireless data:
 I have a tracking system called Mosys. It is run on an intel nuc (rehoused with custom software). It feeds data back to one of our network switches via ethernet- which we then send to the server that processes the data. Since this is mounted on a camera, there are a lot of benefits of wireless transmission. While it is a pc (running a flavor of linux) I wanted to know my options for running wireless signal from this pc to our ethernet switch. The pc has usb ports which already support mouse/usb.

If anything, it seems like the issue has gotten worse. The only fix that helps temporarily for most systems is to push a in place upgrade task sequence via SCCM. This seems to correct whatever component store/SXS corruption initially, but the problem is it seems like for many systems, the problem resurfaces in a month or two. We've since had two Premier tickets with Microsoft without any identification of a root cause. We have looked for various underlying trends such as build process, PC model, installed features/software, antivirus, etc but have been unable to pin it down. We're still using WSU, but we don't believe the issue is on the update server side. It just seems that at some point these machines get corrupted and no amount of SFC or DISM will fix them. In place repair will fix them but only temporarily. Anybody else deal with similar issues? It's frustrating to deal with in an environment where 100% patch compliance is expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been setting up networking (internet and cameras) for a small hotel and restaurant in the Caribbean for the past 3 years. They started off small (just 1 building) but they keep growing. They own about a whole acre of land where they keep building small "bungalows" and container rooms. Now they decided to buy the property across the street and covert it to another 5 rooms for the hotel. They want internet and IP cameras across the street. The "street" is unpaved, and the other property is 84 feet from the office where I keep the modem and router. I'm leaning toward using Cat 6 or fiber to span this distance. My business partner wants to use a Ubiquity air max bridge. I haven't set one of these up, so I don't know how reliable or complicated they are. Theres no vegetation in the line of sight, but it rains a lot. Currently I use a Huwei LTE modem/router with 3 Unifi AP's. I think I am going to add a load balancing router so I can use two ISPs for more consistency and speed. 
 The owner said we could bury a conduit if we want. Also I could hypothetically use the utility poles to span cable (is that a good idea)? I want something thats going to work 99% of the time. I don't live down there so if theres a problem, I have to call and walk someone (usually with very little IT experience) through how to reset a device or trouble shoot. I need reliability.
 I do want to future proof this. If you bury conduit, how deep do you normally go and what diameter do you use? Would you use fiber, Cat 6 cable or a wireless bridge? I really appreciate any help you can offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s your top advice to someone starting a new sysadmin role?
 What should my 30/60/90 day objectives be?
 How should I “manage“ my manager eg. if there’s no structured 90 day on-boarding process, how do I create one? My experience at past roles has been varied, usually am told to read documentation, check the backlog & review the ticketing system to get familiar with common issues. I feel like there’s a better way to set myself up for success.
 I have the natural instinct to want to “fix everything“ and jump right in to the backlog to look productive. Is this a good idea or should I spend a few days/weeks understanding the environment? I want to be helpful but I don’t want to come off as a know-it-all who says everything needs to be changed. Also, I’m aware that some organizations want the end solutions but don’t want the pain of change, so it‘s never a simple process. I feel that starting with documentation may be a better start and mapping out how the IT infrastructure is designed, but not sure what’s next before getting in the weeds.
 I want to make a good impression and ramp up quickly. But I don’t want to set an expectation that I will work late because I need work/life balance to be physically & mentally healthy. Is it a bad look to go home on time when you’ve just started a new role.
  
Thank you for the advice!

 However, when I am on my deathbed, and I am about to die, my purpose will be for nothing. For me to survive, that life is gone. And the rich just got richer. nothing else will have benefited from what I have done, and this life seems complete wasted.
 How do you live a purposeful life after contributing to not much. What do you do outside of work that gives fulfillment. Especially that our existence is of nature, and we sit behind computer screens all day.

 Please bear with me as my ineptitude may show. For history, most of my professional career has been in enduser support. Recently a colleague of mine left and encouraged me to apply for his old position as a network specialist.
 I took the time to relearn what i could and played in a simulated environment and did i ever learn the hard way how different real hardware vs simulation can be. Anyhow, to the question. During the interview we had to complete a skills test that was set up in a collapsed core configuration:
 Cisco catalyst 9500 as the core/distribution switch and a Cisco Catalyst 9300 as the access. One of the Objectives was to set up an etherchannel link between the distribution and access layer switches and using port channel 1 as the container. The directions were vague so I assumed they'd leave it up to the interviewee to choose PAgP or LACP so i opted to set each side to channel group mode on. When I tried to apply the configuration both the 9500 and 9300 spit out "command rejected" I forget the exact verbage. In the end, I ended setting the distribution switch to channel group mode active and the access switch to passive and the etherchannel relationship formed. My I'm just scratching my head as to why mode on was rejected.
 EDIT: fixed some grammar and verbage

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will try to make this explanation short. My company uses an old Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) that uses Java as part of its components. It is truly solely IE dependent for other reasons as well. I have established that over the last 4 years since I began here. I, of course sounded the alarm years ago to management repeatably that IE had an expiration date. They began the lengthy project of upgrading to a cloud version roughly a year ago. This project also is folding in two other ERP programs into this upgrade so you can imagine the huge amount of work going into this. We are projected to go live with this in May.
 I missed the announcement from Microsoft that they would be putting an arrow through the heart of Internet Explorer on Valentines day and I am just discovering users that have had it updated. Basically if you try to use IE it automatically redirects to Edge. The previous settings in Edge under settings>default browser" allowed you to disable the redirect. That is all gone now. I have tried uninstalling all the MS updates on their computers from Feb 14 to date. But none of them seem to give back the capability to use IE. It seems to be the version of Edge 110.0.1587.46 had the options available so that you could stop it from redirecting. Now under version 110.0.1587.89 they are gone. I am trying to find a way to roll this back and possibly stop a major work stoppage for my company. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Ya'll,
 I'm deploying DOT1X EAP-TLS port authentication with a fallback guest VLAN on Cisco Catalyst C3850 switches used for access to offices and shared workspaces. I've followed the Cisco guides and have the proof of concept system working.... mostly. I am running into an issue with DHCP after assignment to the guest VLAN. When authentication fails or times out the port is assigned to the guest VLAN. However the Windows DHCP service times out and self assigns an AIPA address before the DOT1X authentication failure/timeout occurs. The Windows machine will then sit on the Guest VLAN without an IP address for approximately 5 minutes before the Windows DHCP service reattempts a DHCP request and is successful.
 The reason I'm asking this here, is that I would like to adjust my switch configs to account for this since theoretically devices getting assigned to the guest VLAN won't be under my control to adjust Windows DHCP settings.
 Is there a best practice or recommended DOT1X auth timeout?
 The proof of concept is using this setup on the ports:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/X
 switchport mode access
 device-tracking attach-policy dot1x
 authentication event fail action authorize vlan 5
 authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 5
 authentication open
 authentication port-control auto
 authentication timer reauthenticate 180
 authentication violation replace
 dot1x pae authenticator
 dot1x timeout start-period 5
 dot1x timeout held-period 1
 dot1x timeout auth-period 18

 Based on responses and testing, this is the fix that has worked 100% of the time so far for us. Logging out of the effected user and logging back in as a different user and running this script renames the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy folder and when you log back in as the user it recreates the folder and seems to fix the issue.

 Today we've made changes to our VPN, so we need to rename the Service name in our fixvpn script, and therefore need to update the fixvpn.ps1 file.
 However, the only way I can get Group Policy to actually roll out the updated file is to set the Action to "Replace". This isn't ideal as it means that every time a computer runs gpupdate/logs in, it will download that file, and the "Apply once, do not reapply" setting doesn't seem to work with "Replace". I also have no idea how long a computer can go for without being booted up/signed in, so it's less of an 'enable and forget' thing.
 I even tried resaving the file under a different name temporarily, deleting the old file, and uploading the new file with the correct name, in case it was leaning on some kind of file ID or creation date, but still, the script remains unupdated.
 Am I really supposed to run this under "Replace" and have files copied over from SYSVOL every 90 mins?

 We have no real way to prove this as we are in Canada, but ever since the Earthquakes, some of our workers in India have been complaining about latency. Its not all the ISPs that seems to be affected, but the timing is almost spot on.
 Just wondering if you are seeing something similar? 
 In most cases we are seeing a 100ms to 150ms increase from the normal.

Mails are neither sent nor recieved. First user reported it on Monday, it was solved with 2 reboots, other user was solved with creating a new profile after the Outlook repair kicked in. But we also have two users where the local Office programs straight up do not work anymore. Word, Excel display the Yellow Warn symbol top right next to the profile pic. Also displaying the "Account Problem log in again" and when you click on it, the MS login/MFA windows appears with "Please wait" and closes. Sign-In protocols in Azure for the affected users are all successful. Even tried the Outlook repair thingy, which created a new profile, but after that we were not able to add the users account to Outlook. It just fails. For Excel and Word, when you try to open a File from SharePoint in the Desktop App, you get an access-denied error, when you say open it Excel/Word online no problem. According to MS support try to close all Office programs, delete all saved Windows Login Credentials regarding Office and OneDrive. But the affected users only have OneDrive creds stored, as I have both, so maybe this is a step torwards a solution.The Web "Variants" work without a problem for the affected ones, so it's a viable workaround atm.
 Infos: O365, Exchange Online, Hybrid Azure AD
 Maybe someone has the solution or some hint.Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just curious as I'm trying to, slowly, learn to use Wireshark properly. Some years ago I stayed in a big chain hotel in London next to the British Library. Bored in my room I did a network scan of the free WIFI they provided. To my horror I could see everyone else's device, even an old server I think they may not have been using anymore that appear to monitor temperatures. I reported this while there and they promptly locked everything down (essentially just turning on WIFI isolation).
 This time I'm on a cruise ship and not brought my Alfa card with me. Not done an nmap scan as I know about the legality of that. But thought running WIFI shark while I'm connected to check my on ship account shouldn't hurt. But noticed loads of MDNS entries at all the other guests devices. All their device names. Surely this shouldn't be visible if they had WIFI isolation on?
 Isn't this a slight security issue or am I making something of nothing because I'm just not understanding the Wireshark trace?

 My org is about to implement a new to us ticketing system (ServiceNow). As part of that, we proposed rebuilding our monitoring environment from scratch in order to remove as much of our decade of customization as possible, as it has built-in integration with ServiceNow.
 We are currently using Solarwinds SAM and NPM to monitor our environment - Windows, RHEL, AIX, vCenter & ESX, Nutanix AHV, and Cisco/F5/CheckPoint/PaloAlto networking equipment (along with a few random other manufacturer devices we're monitoring via SNMP); including some items on AWS and Azure.

 I've got a test environment with two Cisco 3560CGs connected together with a link agg. Each port is a 1gb port.
 ​
 Each switch has a port with the same vlan on it. At the end of each vlan is a PC with a 1gbNIC.
 ​
 When doing an iperf test between the PCs, my network monitoring software is suggesting that it is only saturating 1 link out of the two with about a gig of traffic.
 ​
 I was under the impression it would balance the load across the two? Or would this only happen if I was able to generate more than a gigworth of traffic?
 ​
 Thaks for the help!

 Any thoughts on reasons why I may want to install an agent to specifically backup AD?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm junior system administrator in small company and I've been given a task to redesign network topology since current one is quite awful. We just bought 2 Huawei 10Gb switches and 5 new servers with 4 10Gb NICs each. I'm not sure how I should set up the network core.
 I was thinking of stacking switches in master/slave configuration, then use LAG to connect my servers to the core. 4 servers' NICs bond into 1 logical NIC, and split 2/4 cables to one switch and the remaining 2/4 to the other. As I understand it, this should give me high redundancy (one whole switch can die and connection will still be ok) and high throughput (some traffic will come to main, some to secondary; total speed should be around 35-40Gb).
 ​
 Is this setup viable, am I going the right way, will it be manageable in the future?

 I assumed connection issues but this has been with a mix of on-site and remote workers so seems less likely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone.
 So today was the first time in my professional life that I outright snapped.
 I got an email this morning regarding an external audit, and that the auditor requested access to specific documents within our organization, you know, standard stuff.
 In my ignorance, I thought that the user would simply share a OneDrive folder/make a team/create a Sharepoint site.... or at least call me for help... but oh no...
 I got an email stating "I solved the issue, and we now have a Dropbox account with all the sensitive info publicly available, have a nice day"
 I never thought I got get this angry with a user, but here we are...
 I promptly called said user, deleted the documents, deleted Dropbox (considered deleting the user from existence), create a OneDrive folder with said documents and shared it with only the auditors.
 While this was going on, the user kept saying that it was my fault that the user was forced to use Dropbox, that the user could not bother to ask me for simple stuff like this and that the user did not receive any formal IT training in all the years the user had been alive, which also was my fault.
 You can guess how my reaction to this barrage of BS went... 
 I hope you all had a better morning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just read this article: https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/2017/03/virtual-machine-vcpu-and-vnuma-rightsizing-rules-of-thumb.html
 The examples at the end make it clear how I should rightsize my VMs to align with the physical host. The problem is, we have clusters with ESXi hosts with different # Cores and different # Sockets. For example, in one cluster we have a host with 6 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620), 8 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz) and 12 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz). 
 The cluster is EVC enabled with at Intel® "Sandy Bridge" Generation. These CPUs typically have 1-4 Cores. (4-6 Extreme, 2-8 Xeon).
 I'm a bit confused how I align my vCPUs in this example. I would assume I align with the host with the least amount of cores, so 6. Btw, we are running ESXi 7.0.3.
 Example 1: VM with 4 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 1 socket with 4 cores 
 Example 2: VM with 8 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 2 sockets with 4 cores 
 Example 3: VM with 16 vCPUs
 => VM configuration: 4 socket with 4 cores 
 Am I getting this right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 after 9 years in IT, I had my big upsi moment.
 I was setting up a new WSUS in an environment. It was planned to rollout monthly updates in 4 rings. Test, Auto update 1, Auto update 2, manual update. So far so good. Created the gpo and put the servers in the group.
 Well, yesterday it happened... The downloaded 02.2023 Update was downloaded the day after patchday. So far so good. Only the servers within the Test group installed it. BUT then yesterday, every server just went to the WSUS, installed the updates and rebooted automatically. Even the ones that are in the manual group.
 ​
 The thing that confuses me the most is
  
I put in a time, when the servers should NOT restart --> get's ignored
 The updates were planned to be installed at the end of this week + next week
 No matter if I put the "Configure automatic update" GPO to option 4 (auto download, install and reboot to schedule) or to option 3 (auto download notify for install), they'll always immediately download and install them.
  
I have no clue what's wrong and tried to re-create this behavior in my LAB. So far I don't run into the same issue...
 ​
 Will have a review later today. Guess I better prepare to get a new job...

Atm, we have antiquated group polices setup on about 100 workstations (used by medical staff) that the county IT people refuses to fix and frequently interrupts work. I have a big meeting with every manager involved and some changes could happen due to finger pointing between us contractors and county officials. 
 Essentially my wishlist would be to have county setup a separate domain controller with no original scripts running, so I can implement what I see fit. 
 I believe all I would need access to is a server connected to countydomain2 correct? 
 I should have no issue swapping user profiles from one domain to the other. I also believe that they will still be able to access their original county controlled emails via outlook correct? 
 Am I going about this completely wrong or is there something I'm missing?

 currently in our production we have a special vlan for cnc machines and a special vlan for clients in the production. Most of the machines are using SMBv1 (you cant change that, because most of them are too old) and I want to implement a SMBv1 Proxy for this.
 The clients access the machines directly over SMBv1 to their network shares to integrate or remove the production files on the machine.
 Unfortunately I dont have the real time to get in the topic so I'm searching for a company which could do that and also maintain this solution (most important part). 
 Any idea of companies which do that kind of "production" things?

Used to be able to remove a few things, run a couple rounds of windows updates and throw on the domain and it was fine. Seems like for the last couple years we always have to reimage the laptop. If we don’t we have issues with the CPU maxing out at 100% on weird built in system processes. Anyone else see that and/or have a solution for It. It’s also weird that we don’t have to do it on the desktops we get from them.
 For reference we’re a relatively small shop and don’t have put out a ton of laptops all the time. I’d say 2-3 a month. If we didn’t have to do a full reimage, we typically install office 365, sophos AV, ninja RMM client, forticlient VPN, run a round or two of windows updates then add the computer to the domain. I also run Dell command update and remove optimizer.
 Just looking for any suggestions other than reimage them every time. I’ve built MDT servers in the past so I know that’s an option, but don’t think i do enough computers to justify the time investment yet.

 But.. I’ve got this client with an assortment of printers. All 5+ years old, some are Xerox Phaser, some HP LJs, they all suck. One phaser says MPC error randomly until you reboot it. One LJ has black streaks (client buys knockoff toner because apparently the legit stuff is too expensive), another LJ prints rainbow like all the cartridges leaked. One HP LJ ghosts images / print. My recommendation is to replace them, or go with MFPs that are proper and under a support contract, but the client just expects me to magically fix all these. 
 Is this a legitimate frustration, or is this something an experienced IT admin should be able to do, and do I just suck?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 I have always been confused with the retention policies in M365. So hopefully someone here can clarify this for me. 
 If you enable retention policy to retain all data indefinitely in M365 via Microsoft 365 Data Lifecycle Management so it applies globally to all M365 apps (exchange, onedrive, sharepoint etc.). What happens if you disable a user account and remove the license?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users One Drive?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users emails? I know its not going to create inactive mailbox but can you still search the emails from/to this users via eDiscovery?
 - What happens after 30 days, 60 days or 90 days when the standard Microsoft retention period (outside M365 Data Lifecycle Management) expires? Will the data get deleted or will the retention policy kick in and all data will still be available via eDiscovery?
 The key here is, I dont care about restoring user data, it is more for compliance/legal purposes so as long as their data is searchable and can be found within e-discovery, I am happy.
 I keep getting conflicting messages from few M365 consultants. Some saying you need to delete the account when the license is still intact otherwise retention policy wont kick in. Others are saying it should apply the retention policy setup globally regardless. I dont want to find it the hard way so im just gathering some information here and there while waiting an official answer from M$.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are the facts of the situation:
  
We are an MSP with a central office that has a backup appliance.
 
Our customers' servers send data backups to this appliance daily. 
 
Our office and all customers have static IP public IPv4 addresses.
 
Data comes in on TCP 35116 and 35117 which is port forwarded to our backup appliance (see below before you gasp :)
 
 Here is what we do to secure this
  
The office firewall drops all inbound traffic on 35116 and 35117 (actually all ports) unless it is coming from a customer IP address. We maintain an alias in our firewall for customer IP addresses
 
Backup files are encrypted with a 2048bit key as they are generated at the customer site. They cannot be read without this key
 
The connection itself is TLS from the customer server to the backup appliance
 
The backup client at the customer sites must have a seperate 2048bit key in order to connect and have Read/Write access to the backup appliance
 
The backup appliance is off domain and uses a separate set of credentials from anything else
 
  
Here is the debate.
 A coworker is pretty insistent that we should be running these connections over a VPN of some sort. Either OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec maybe. I have countered that since the backups themselves are encrypted AND are being sent over TLS, this is not necessary and would harm performance.
 What do you think? Is adding a site-to-site VPN (with appropriate firewall rules and controls) to this setup worthwhile?
