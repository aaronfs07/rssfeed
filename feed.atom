 Got a pretty basic question, I was offered to work on a small security gig as a freelancer, this would be extra work on top of my regular day job (IT Manager for a medium sized business).
 For some extra context, the project involves rolling out endpoint security to about 30 devices, this includes researching potential software, configuring it, testing, installation, knowledge transfer and handover to their onsite service desk guy. They do not have any MDM solutions, and said they don’t want one for now, so it’s a little bit extra manual work.
 The hours and expectations are something that works well for me, but they asked how much I want to charge per hour, and I have no idea what to tell them. For context this is a remote contract for a Berlin based company. Any advise how much I should ask for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a bit shocked by how many companies fail these email security protocols. Particularly, what types of companies fail.
 Mostly banks and merchant processors that also send .htm files as attachments through email that require a password login. So those emails would normally be blocked.
 My whitelist has grown ridiculously long now because I can't block business-critical vendors. I've had missed invoices and bills before, and some aspects of the business had to go offline because we all missed the late notices.
 Is there anything to do here? Even looking for pass results for SPF,DKIM,DMARC have blocked other businesses we work with. What other things can I filter for? There's so much junk and garbage coming our way via email.
 And here's the kicker, when I started with this company, some of the corporate people had their email logged into around the world. They fell for phishing attempts and we didn't have 2FA. The majority of what gets blocked are spoofed phishing attempts. But no one notices because, well, they get blocked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m looking for a bit of advice, current scenario is we have accreditation that requires vulnerability patches above a CVSS 7 to be deployed within 14 days.
 On the Server side this is performed in phases, 
 Test patches to critical production servers in a test lab. - 2 to 4 days depending on whether any application servers also need patching.
 Deployment to production - In office hours patching of backoffice servers - 1 day if all goes well
 Deployment to critical - 1 day out of hours
 This process is currently manual and takes a full week for 1 tech every month, I’m getting push back from my management on why we patch so often taking up internal resource, a comment from my non IT manager was they had never worked anywhere that patched as diligently as we do.
 Despite the procedure being fully documented I’ve struggled to outsource it.
 Estate is about 25 servers, 4 physical, all windows and hyper-V, and some nix virtual appliances. There’s a lot of business change and the estate is in constant flux, so we have to change and refine the patching procedure on a monthly basis. 
 I’d say about 60-70% of the time is actually spent initiating the patch tasks the rest is waiting, and in that we do get to spin other plates.
 Does anybody have any thoughts on how to approach this? I’m happy to hear about modern tooling that can automate the process without introducing a management burden for the automation itself, or just better ways to gain buy in for the current procedure.
 We are moving a lot of owned infra to saas so this burden will be reduced over the next couple of years anyway.
 Thank you 🙏🏻

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This one caught me a bit by surprise... I work for a small company of less than 30 employees and recently found out that the owner has been talking to a M&A broker as well as getting a professional valuation of the company. The owner has been slowly winding himself down for retirement and been passing many of his tasks down to others. 
 I've been the sole IT person for many years now and have been in IT for nearly 20 years at this point. I've been through many M&A's in my time and all of them have turned out sour (maybe not right away, but within a year or two) so needless to say, I'm a bit on edge. I live in a rural area with very few IT jobs. The IT jobs here are often sole IT positions or small MSP's wearing multiple hats. I am a "jack of all trades, but master of none". This being a rural area, the average income is around $32,000 a year and most IT positions pay around $17-$21 an hour... I'm currently at $26 an hour, the most I've made in my life. 
 I know this is a decision only I can make, but would you ride out this position and see what happens, or start looking elsewhere? I would take a pay cut going elsewhere obviously and it's very slim pickings around here. The 1st time I was laid off, it took me nearly 2 years to find something else and the 2nd time I was laid off, I ended up relocating to a major city in a different state and had 3 interviews in a single day, but ended up moving back for various reasons after landing a work from home position. 
 The job market where I live is terrible and a lot of my coworkers over the years ended up relocating after losing positions. The area I live sucks... wages do not match the cost of living and the town is in a "big city prices, but small town wages" stage.

I installed Papercut Mobility Free Server on a remote user's computer, enabled the cloud feature, and shared/enabled the printer. I then obtained the share link, went to our Server 2008 R2, installed the mobility software, and when I click "add printer," a command prompt briefly appears and disappears without any action. I've tried clicking it multiple times, uninstalling/reinstalling, logging in as admin, adjusting firewalls and ports, but still, the command prompt vanishes when I click the button. Oddly, the user had no trouble with a different printer before, but now, removing the old mobility printer and adding the new one leads to installation failure. Wouldn't it be simpler if they provided an IP address for connection? Any suggestions to make this work

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello new single guy IT department here,
 I just started a new job where I'm the only IT guy and I'm having to learn a lot on the job. One thing I'm struggling to find good info on is how to push software updates from the server to client machines without UAC. I know it's possible and common practice but it isn't set up on the current domain and I never made a group policy before. Let me start from the beginning. 
 Just today I was informed about a big software update for one of our core applications will be taking place on Tuesday and is required to go live that day. I have received the email to log in to download the upload to push to the client machines (I don't have an account created yet to get the application that's how new I am but I am assuming it's an MSI file which I heard is required to push updates).
 Problem is this update can't be put into place any earlier than Tuesday but also goes live on the same day so I wouldn't be able to add it manually to each machine throughout the day on Monday or on Tuesday before everyone comes in. I was hoping to be able to have the update be pushed to all the machines Tuesday morning before everyone comes in and be ready for them to go. 
 I'm just very nervous I'm going to ruin something and mess everything up badly or not be able to push and cause a massive delay to the start of the day. Any guidance on how to create a GP to push the update then install on Tuesday morning? I'm doing research but on a pretty big time crunch as it is already late into Friday. Thanks.

I did some digging into why and both of those (maybe they're the same company?) use Trend Micro's cloud-based anti-spam as their MX records point to a trendmicro.com domain. Checked our outbound records and our O365 is handing off to Trend Micro just fine. The rejection emails list 550 5.7.1 errors and trendmicro servers/IPs as listed in Spamhaus. Sure enough I spot-check them and yup, their servers are on the block list. Test from a gmail account and it bounces too so I know it's not on our end. Looks like the issue is between Trend Micro and Spamhaus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading these things are a POS (to each their own) however I was able to acquire a NOS 8132F switch on the original firmware v5.1.0.1. I've since updated it to the latest which is v6.5.4.20. Last FW update was in 2022 which makes this still relevant.
 I have the PC8100 10GBASE-T Module (RJ-45) installed and I can't seem to get this module to route any traffic.
  
Port 1 - Laptop for testing
 Port 4 - Internet/LAN/etc
  
The laptop gets an IP address via the DCHP server upstream on port 4 however nothing is pingable. Can't ping the upstream gateway, other computers/devices on the upstream network, DNS addresses, or domains.
 Maybe my interpretation of what this module does is wrong? I'm under the impression that the module adds (4) 10gbe RJ-45 ports to this fibre switch and can be used in conjunction with the 24 fibre ports.
 The 4 ports on the module appear blue and not gray in the GUI as I've removed them from being stacking ports.
 Different issue but may be related:
 I did a full reset of the switch by deleting the "startup-config" along with the "running-config". I've tried the EZ setup and it won't "see" the upstream DHCP server (when setting the out-of-band IP). I had to set that manually via the console.
 Grab a laptop and plug the upstream ethernet into it and everything works. Laptop receives an IP and you can ping fqdn's and ip addresses without an issue.
 Any ideas?

People in the department got burnt out and moved on (I don't blame them). Now we are left with no leadership in the department with any technical background and severely understaffed. 
 Overall the organization and the acting department head have been supportive and understanding (although lots of them were partly at fault for putting the department in this situation, imo). We are quickly trying to hire more staff. Leadership and the acting department head have mentioned the same thing several times, in interviews or meetings, that bothers me:
 "We want to create a customer service driven IT department" the acting department head has added details occasionally saying "so what if you visit a location and only expected to be there for an hour but ended up staying for 4 helping out staff" 
 To me this is a big red flag. How is the team suppose to prioritize tickets if we are encouraging staff to flag us down when they see us? How does my team make it to a previously scheduled appointment?
 I'm not even a tech so it doesn't even affect me directly but in my opinion, this is creating a company culture that an IT department would dred. I have a meeting with the acting department head soon and want to bring up some concerns with moving in this direction. 
 Let me know your thoughts. Am I overthinking this? If not, what are some concerns I can bring to the table with the acting department head to try to get them to understand what a terrible plan this is. 
 Thank you!

 My HR Department recently posted an opening for a sysadmin.
 So far, we've been flooded with applicants relatively fresh from various military branches, and most of them have secret or higher clearance listed on their resumes. 
 We're not a large company, and we haven't specified needing a clearance level (we don't).
 I would think they would be more focused on jobs that require a clearance- am I missing something?
 Edit: thanks for the feedback! Part of the confusion I guess is that two years ago we had a posting for the same position and didn't have any former military apply. For all knew there had been some upheaval in that space I wasn't aware of.

The downside of this is that it tries to recompile the MOF/MFL files containing "Uninstall" and "Remove" which strips them out of the WMI Database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At my wits end with this bizarre issue.
 We've got a fleet of around 70 Lenovo X1 Carbons, gen 8,9 and have rolled out a batch of 10s, around 15 of gen 10s. Every single one of the 10th gens is running into a VPN disconnection issue, our VPN client (Pulse Secure) logs an error message about NC Route Conflict Detected, Disconnecting.
 There is no logging of what modifies a route map in Windows, but I've made some power shell scripts to do route print when the network goes down (Pulse Secure disables local gateway via route metrics), or literally every second and save the output to a file if it's different from the previous second.
 When this issue happens, the bizarre thing is that a network destination of 104.244.42.0 255.255.255.0 owned by twitter, shows up in the route table, if the user does not interfere, a minute or so later that will be removed from the route table and then the VPN reconnects. I have no idea if this is a symptom of the issue or part of the culprit... but when I use an event viewer consolidator tool like nirsoft and set timestamps, the first event being logged is always the VPN client showing 'nc route conflict detected', sometimes the event prior to it was a couple of seconds earlier, no scheduled task or service history or anything like that.
 I've done a Fresh Start to get rid of any new bloatware and uninstalled everything I could. Everything is up to date. My next step is going to be a fersh win10 image from media creation tool on a local account without Intune/Autopilot to rule out anything org specific, but you can go back months in the event viewer on the gen 8 and 9 X1 Carbons and the "NC Route Conflict Detected" error has never appeared once on dozens of them. With the 10th gens you are lucky to go an hour before it happens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Man i feel so dumb, just spent 3 hours and another coworker spent a while on setting up a printer for a new client that stopped working. No error messages on logs, as far as the computer and printer know, it printed but nothing comes out. No error messages. It does make noise but nothing. Scanning and copying work normal. 
 Tried all the usual, new drivers, even firmware. The printer would act like it would want to print but nothing came out, set up a new computer and tried the same thing, even setting up via its IP and no dice. Tried our work laptop and same thing. Called Lexmark and they were helpful but after an hour they had to escalate it. Currently still waiting for them to call back. 
 Then an old timer walks in and asks what the problem is, we tell him the printer may be bad and waiting on Lexmark escalation then he says he’s able to print. I ask if he doesnt mind trying it and sure enough it fucken printed. Asked him if could take a look at the computer and the fucken thing has a setting for secure printing. We check the box within the driver , add the code and thats it. 
 Im familiar with secure printing but usually, they log it, they beep or gives and error. This one did nothing and they didnt know anything about a code since it was prebuilt in by their previous IT. 
 Hopefully this helps the next guy.

 I can browse to the IP and get a login prompt. The first time I attempted to login at this prompt...I was successful and it allowed me to download the Secure Client. However, when I tried to login to the Secure Client (using the same credentials), I got "Login Fail". Since then, I have gotten a "Login Fail" on both the browser prompt and the Secure Client prompt. 
 I have changed my password, created new users, etc. Every time I get "Login Fail". I have assigned the VPN Group Policy and VPN Group Lock to the users/passwords I am trying.
 What the hell am I doing wrong here?
 EDIT:
 I've also since configured Radius as well. I'm getting the same "Login Fail" result. However, when I test authentication to my radius server (via the ASA CLI) I'm successful. So, it seems that it can't be my credentials. Or at least it shouldn't be. But so far I'm not seeing any more detailed info than "Login Fail".

What is the best way to go about this from people that have traveled here or go often? Can i have them take a picture of me instead of biometrics? I see there is a portal/pin option when logging into your account, not sure if that helps limit things. Any advice? Cheers!

Our HQ is in the US, but we operate in about 26 other markets throughout the world, primarily in LATAM and APAC regions. Most of our infrastructure is on-prem at our HQ, including in-house developed apps delivered via Citrix.
 We're nearing the end of our original contract, and so we have been exploring other SD-WAN options, however upper management seems really interested in once specific solution, Aryaka. I just can't see it. We're a couple of months into a PoC with Aryaka and still doesn't seem to fit our needs as well as Prisma SD-WAN has. Am I just flat out missing something? They just don't seem to be worth the cost to me.
 *edit* We have no MPLS links. All of our current ISP connections are DIA circuits. 
 *edit 2* When we first evaluated SD-WAN 5 years ago, we evaluated Velo, Viptella, Meraki, and Prisma. We attempted to evaluate SilverPeak, but they drug their feet on setting up a PoC with us, so they eliminated themselves at that time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reading these things are a POS (to each their own) however I was able to acquire a NOS 8132F switch on the original firmware v5.1.0.1. I've since updated it to the latest which is v6.5.4.20. Last FW update was in 2022 which makes this still relevant.
 I have the PC8100 10GBASE-T Module (RJ-45) installed and I can't seem to get this module to route any traffic.
  
Port 1 - Laptop for testing
 Port 4 - Internet/LAN/etc
  
The laptop gets an IP address via the DCHP server upstream on port 4 however nothing is pingable. Can't ping the upstream gateway, other computers/devices on the upstream network, DNS addresses, or domains.
 Maybe my interpretation of what this module does is wrong? I'm under the impression that the module adds (4) 10gbe RJ-45 ports to this fibre switch and can be used in conjunction with the 24 fibre ports.
 The 4 ports on the module appear blue and not gray in the GUI as I've removed them from being stacking ports.
 Different issue but may be related:
 I did a full reset of the switch by deleting the "startup-config" along with the "running-config". I've tried the EZ setup and it won't "see" the upstream DHCP server (when setting the out-of-band IP). I had to set that manually via the console.
 Grab a laptop and plug the upstream ethernet into it and everything works. Laptop receives an IP and you can ping fqdn's and ip addresses without an issue.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tried two different console servers, both OpenGear and TrippLite (Eaton) but I was not able to get any output on the console no matter what settings I configured. If this worked then I could do a multi ssh into each device through the server. But that's not going to work at this point.
 I work for an "ITAD" / asset managment company and while I'm not stictly anything in particular or even a sysadmin, most of the tasks I do still apply, such as wiping devices, removing from remote management, etc.
 Most of these are the older 802.11n WAPs but a few hundred are the later 802.11ac WAPs.
 So far I have three laptops with USB serial adapters going.
 ​
 One to verify the APs are in AP console mode, and two for actively resetting one while another reloads after the NVRAM wipe.
 All I have is myself and one other coworker who is good with enterprise networking gear.
 ​
 I'm trying to find a way to send commands to somewhere like 10 or 20 serial (RS232/RJ45) devices (the aformentioned WAPs).
 I have around 25 USB to serial adapters on hand, probably 10 that are tested and ready to go.
 I can't find anything really that will do what I am looking for, bar custom several-thousand dollar systems.
 ​
 If I can't figure out a way to do multiple I honestly might just quit and try and find a new gig. It's incredibly frustrating to do this whole process.
 ​
 The two models:
 The overwhelming majority are AIR-CAP3602l-A-K9 (802.11n)
 A few hundred AIR-AP3802L-B-K9 (802.11ac)
 ​
 Thanks and let me know if this isn't an appropriate place to post this.
 I'm on lunch right now so I likely won't be able to check until tonight. ANY help is appreciated.
 E1: Thanks everyone for the ideas ... I ordered a RS232 splitter to play with. Told my boss it would be two weeks with no breaks, and that isn't gonna happen. Not skipping my lunch anymore.
 E2: Emailed the CEO and Sales to let them know what I think :) Y'all are the best.

 I do a bunch of searching and I’ve never received any prior emails for this gift card from this vendor. Then it hits me… it’s a sales tactic.
 Yikes these folks are getting very aggressive. Attributing gift cards to folks without telling them then having it expire just so they’ll get an email from the fulfillment service then call the sales person about the “expired gift card”. Wow. 
 RingCentral, do better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been in the PC industry for over 20 years at this point. I spent a good 12 years or so in the PC repair space. As a result, I have a strong knowledge of hardware, the Windows Operating system, repairing software and so on.
 When our company started venturing into the B2B/MSP market, most of us "graduated" from the PC repair space. As a result, almost all the techs I worked with had all of the same skills as I did.
 Within the past few years, we have pretty much lost all of those employees (they all moved on to bigger and better positions).
 My question is this... Is it an unrealistic expectation that an IT tech of today would have the skills to roam through a BIOS and understand things like AHCI, UEFI, CSM, etc... Understanding when a CMOS battery has failed and the symptoms of that... or just build a modern day PC correctly (which is easier now than it's ever been). I constantly keep encounter technicians that do possess these skills.
 I was thinking that it's possible that my days in repair are giving me a much greater level of understanding vs someone who maybe never did but was in IT. I guess I just expect that if you are in this industry, you would understand this type of stuff.
 Am I just expecting too much?

 I work K12 IT, and I have a FOSS classroom monitoring program called Veyon installed in our Windows computer lab. It worked great on our old machines, but I’m getting zero response from ANY of the new machines I installed this summer. To complicate matters, I moved from a Meraki MX firewall to a FortiGate over the summer, so it could be a config issue there.
 Here’s what I checked so far:
  
FortiGate firewall policies: logs show ping traffic from Staff VLAN to Lab VLAN was “accept”ed.
 All switches in that chain* have the Lab VLAN allowed on the trunk ports
 Added Any/Any/Any rule in Windows firewall on the clients
 There’s no Wifi involved so that is not a factor.
  
*chain = Firewall to Core switch to IDF switch to access switch to Lab clients
 FACTS
  
I cannot ping from Staff VLAN to Windows clients on the Lab VLAN. 
 I cannot ping from Wifi VLAN to ChromeOS clients on the Lab VLAN.
 I can ping the computer lab B&W printer on the Lab VLAN.
 I can ping the computer lab Color printer on the Lab VLAN.
  
REQUEST
 Teach me how to fish better. What else should I check?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 at work I run a Mailman 2 environment I inherited from my precessor, and it's in large parts a blackbox for me. Now I want to set up a test server (VM) running Mailman 3 and I wonder, which DBMS might be best for this? 
 The plan is to set up a few test lists, test migration from Mailman 2 -> 3. Then, when tests are ok, scale up the VM and move all the lists to Mailman 3, so I need a DBMS that can handle all the data from the very beginning. There are approx. 700 lists, most of them are small (>100 users) but there are also some with 60k users and web archives as old as 20 years. I doubt there will be further upscaling since we run the mailing list for our... "older legacy customers" while newer/younger users populate more web2.0-ish social networks. Each list votes their own admins/mods and most of them are noobs. So if I understand the docs correctly, a web interface (Postorius + Hyperkitty, both based on Django) is a must.
 I have almost no experience with doing stuff on SQL-level, but this could change (webarchive scraping for market research etc). So I wonder, which DBMS would you suggest? Mailman 3 comes with SQLite, is it sufficient or should I choose MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL? 
 Thanks in advance!

Followed the official Microsoft Doc (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/forest-recovery-guide/ad-forest-recovery-perform-initial-recovery) step by step and restored one domain controller from each domain.
 Now one DC from each domain is up and running in the same subnet, the Microsoft doc says I need to verify replication health. It does not mention how to. Replication is broken to some domains because the KCC establishes connections to non-restored domain controllers which are not available. Keep in mind that metadata cleanup of domain controllers outside the current domain was not mentioned in the doc.
 Now the replication is broken between some domains. I tried to create a manual replication object and replicate manually, but I get the error:
 The naming context is in the process of being removed or is not replicated from the specified server.
 At this point I also cannot cleanup the non-restored domain controllers, I get the error:
 A referral was returned from the server.
 Been at this for quite a few days now, pisses me off the Microsoft doc is so trash. "Just create direct connection for faster replicate" my ass when the manual replication is not working.

 I have a network that has multiple subnets all hitting a specific dhcp server. We have dhcp relays setup on the layer 3 switches.
 ​
 However, looking at a wireshark capture on the DHCP server, I see multiple DHCP discover messages from multiple dhcp switches, even some not in the same subnet. The DHCP server will NAK the ones that aren't in the correct subnet and offer an IP in the correct subnet, but it's not working quite right.
 ​
 I guess I have two questions.
 1) Should I be seeing multiple dhcp discovers across multiple subnets?
 2) If not, what should I be looking for? I'm guessing an incorrect VLAN tag somewhere.

 Small one but it's driving me nuts. Don't have any official support for the device and in a tricky spot since it's not working, can't sign up for any.
 Currently have a a Kodak 730ex scan station that will not boot properly. It just goes to a black screen. Can see mouse moving about, nothing else. Can get it to boot into bios but device has an unknown password that Kodak support will not devulge. 
 Tried checking manuals and various Google searches but these devices seem to be neiche and not used much.
 Long shot but does anyone here have any experience with these devices and have any suggestion what to do next?
 Cheers

 Unfortunately they don't use any kind of content management tool or ticketing system, they are literally emails in a shared mailbox. I've been trying for years to get them to change that, but to no avail. Any advice is hugely appreciated, as I've become a bit lost in my research so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of course they have edge routers with BGP and core switches and so on, but I am more interested in the hypervisor networking.
 They probably have a huge amount of hosts running a hypervisor technology like KVM with VMs running on it.
 My question is how did they setup the network regarding this topic?
 Do they have a bridge running on the hypervisor that interconnects all VMs together? Wouldn't that be insecure because VM 1 could potentially sniff / spoof VM 2 network?
 Are they using the host as a kind of router (also known host-routed mode) where VMs are separately connected?
 Does every VM have its own VLAN? Probably VXLAN I guess if so, because VLANs are limited at 4094. VXLAN at 16 mil.
 Are there any whitepapers on this? The nearest thing I found was from DigitalOcean, but they do only talk about the network itself: https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/building-the-next-generation-of-digitalocean-networking
 As example, if you do a traceroute on a hetzner VPS you always see _gateway (172.31.1.1) as first hop, but the public IP of the VPS has /32 configured. How?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today was no ordinary day at the office. I'm a senior network engineer, and I was tasked with upgrading our network to support the growth in remote work that the company was experiencing. It seemed simple at first: expand the subnet, reconfigure the routing, and perhaps modify a few firewall rules. But I soon encountered a roadblock.
 The new IP range had to be meticulously planned. It was like piecing together a complex jigsaw puzzle, except each piece was an IP address, and the final picture was an efficient network.
 So, while searching for a solution, I came across a cidr notation calculator. Intrigued by its simple design, I decided to put it to the test.
 I entered our network information and started playing around with different CIDR notations. The results were instantaneous. It simplified a process that would've otherwise taken hours into mere minutes.
 With the planned new subnets and CIDR notations, I rolled up my sleeves and began the arduous implementation process. Everything seemed to be going smoothly. But networking is a world full of surprises.
 I realized that the change affected one of our legacy systems, which relied on a static IP. Panic started to set in as I scrambled to figure out a workaround.
 The solution was in the very tool I had just discovered. I realized I could use it to find a new, compatible IP range that would not conflict with the legacy system. With a few clicks and some thoughtful consideration, I managed to reconfigure the system without affecting any critical functions.
 The rest of the day was spent monitoring the network, ensuring that the changes were successfully implemented and that everything was functioning properly.
 As I shut down my computer and reflected on the day, I realized that sometimes the most complex problems have simple solutions. All it takes is the right tool and a willingness to explore unconventional paths.
 Remember, there's always room for innovation and discovery.

 Do they even make threaded PVC conduit bodies? Should I just not worry about one conduit body on the run being metal/conductive?

 I'm in the final day of a printer rollout project and we have decided to move away from scanning to folders, opting for scanning to email instead.
 I was speaking to a staff member late last night about this and he wasnt very happy with the change, I understand some people just dont like change... I got him to show me his process and what he has to do after scanning. In his defence, scan to email does involve more work for the users.
 the reason for moving away from folder scans is mainly due to moving into azure files, and wanting to save storage costs. I'm abit unsure If I should push back to my manager and see if network scanning could be possible the cost would be extremely minimal, but really unsure of the security implications. 
 Any advise?

 An Asian retail customer expanding to EU countries.
 At their original region, they have 1-2 stores in each country as the national network hubs. The hubs have DIA and MPLS to aggregate network from all other smaller stores in the same country, forming a backhaul with regional hubs (where they have their DC and cloud connectivities).
 Each local store has a broadband FTTx/ADSL or cellular Internet, connecting back to said national hub via IPSec VPN.
 (Local stores ---VPN--- Nation hubs ---MPLS or VPN over DIA--- Regional hubs)
 This eliminates the international bandwidth requirements for local stores.
 But since EU countries are more developed and in close distance, does broadband service between these countries count as domestic or international bandwidth?

I’ve got quite a few people at my job who come to me asking me to fix their phones or tablets because “x doesn’t do y anymore” or their photos aren’t showing up, or don’t know something. I’m starting to think I should implement a personal policy of not working on personal device problems like that to avoid liability and other things

 does anyone have any idea why Microsoft's HEVC (H.265) Video Extensions has so often vulnerabilities?
 I have stopped counting, but by now there must have been a double-digit number of remote code execution vulnerabilities alone.
 Btw... the latest one is CVE-2023-38170.
 What is the reason for this?
 What is so special about these extensions?
 Thanks and greetings,
 Martin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a building with many apartments. My tenants have been asking me to provide WiFi, even suggesting to pay me a monthly fee for it's access. I have been waiting for a good solution because I am afraid of the liability of them downloading illegal stuff.
 But Hotels have been doing it forever. Surely, something can be done in a "safe" way! I noticed that hotels usually require the user to log in and register. Making this person liable I guess? Also it would allow me to create accounts for tenants that are paying the WiFi and allow them to login from different devices (thus not forcing me to whitelist mac addresses). Maybe as a bonus see who are the "big users" in case someone is hogging all the WiFi bandwidth.
 What would suit my needs best? Is there already a router out there that does all of this?
 tldr : what router do hotels use to control the WiFi usage?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a lot of analytics data in half a dozen places for a couple of thousand devices. The data is collected by a combination of Statseeker, Solarwinds, a couple of in-house apps, some cloud management tools. I have been challenged to pull the data from the tools together and develop some dashboards, etc, and ways to consolidate the data without replacing the current tools. We don't want yet another tool monitoring the devices, but, we want to use all the data that has been amassed.
 PowerBI would be the preferred analytics tool, as dashboards would be specific to groups/applications/functionality, etc. "Everyone" that would be consuming the analytics already is familiar with it. 
 So far, i've been doing one off things using API pulls as dataset in PowerBI and build the stuff, it's kind of cumbersome. I would love to get all my data into a "date lake" or something of that nature. Azure has great resources for storing and using like event hubs to deal with streamed analytics. 
 Has anyone figured out a way with any of the named tools to get that data from the tool into something bigger as a consolidation point for analytics?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a lead engineer with a realtively large tech company, my role is mainly implementing new systems and mitigating security risks. My IT manager came to me the other day with an interesting question and I was a little stumped to come up with a good answer at first.
 "If you had unlimited funds to spend on security/IT improvements, what would you suggest we do?"
 To preface this, we are a relatively proactive company working to constantly advance security, there is a large board meeting coming up and the CIO posed this question to the manager. I'll give a bit of background on where we are now...
  
Full Azure AD, no On-prem 
 Devices are AD Joined using autopilot.
 Fully E5 licensed and using almost all key security features.
 Actively monitoring Defender for Endpoint for vulnerabilities and patching them rapidly.
 Using SIEM with a 24/7 monitoring team to track risks in AD, Devices and connected services.
 Mostly remote users with laptops, all via a Cloud Network Gateway firewall 
  
I understand it would be even harder not knowing more about the company and I can provide a bit more context if needed.
 One of my thoughts was to spend more on training IT and security teams up on latest certifications, since that's probably going to have the biggest flow on effect.
 What are some of the big spend improvements you would love to do but are held back due to costs?

In my last role, unless a card went bad, or an upgrade happened, almost every issue was on the physical layer.
 Do you experience outages because whatever cloud platform you are using actually has the same type of issues that most on premise shops would experience? IE: Hardware going bad, systems freezing, issues after upgrades, etc. If so, how do you handle them?
 This may be a little more on the systems side, but what are some other common cloud infrastructure issues that you come across? Do you ever have to cut a ticket to AWS or Azure to look into their systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently taken on a project to manage the network infrastructure at an assisted living facility. The transition from the prior technician was not smooth, leaving me with limited documentation on a multifaceted setup. Here's the current configuration:
 Zone 1: 2 Netgear GS752TP, 4 Netgear GS108PE, 1 TP-Link T1600G-52PS.
 Zone 2: 1 Netgear GS752TP, 1 TP-Link T1600G-52PS.
 Zone 3: 1 Netgear GS752TP.
 Zone 4: 1 TP-Link T1600G-52PS, 1 Netgear GS752TP.
 Zone 5: 1 Netgear GS752TP.
 Additional Equipment: Over 116 VoIP phones and a minimum of 16 Netgear APs, which I believe are cloud-managed.
 With 13 years in the tech industry, I've primarily worked with Ubiquiti equipment. This current setup, due to its complexity and size, presents a new challenge. The facility is on a business line, but there's an initiative to shift to a new 500/500 fiber connection. I've encountered some access issues, as the passwords I have aren't functional.
 I'm seeking insights or advice related to the equipment mentioned and best practices for managing such a setup. Your expertise would be invaluable in this endeavor. Thank you for your time and assistance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are swapping out a few older Cisco UCS servers for Poweredge and the plan is to connect them with SFP+ DAC cables to a stack of Catalyst C9200’s. This is my first time working with DAC cables and I’m very green with optics, so I bought a pair of MSA compliant DAC cables to use for this, thinking that would be the end of it. Connecting from the C9200 to the intel X710 results in the switch throwing an “invalid-gbic” error and the server not picking up any link on the cable. After cycling the interface, I updated the switch config to stop changing the interface to err-disabled when an invalid-gbic error is thrown but I keep getting interface down (notconnect). This is obviously a comptability issue in my eyes. 
 Does anyone have any resources for connecting two different vendors like this? The compatibility matrices for Cisco and Dell don’t have any matching products from what I’ve seen. Would I be better off buying Cisco compatible transceivers for the switch side and Intel compatible transceivers for the server side and connect them via fiber? (or 10GB copper ethernet?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has been a loosely enforced, unpublished "guideline" that I think needs to be upgraded for a more formal, enforceable rule based on the recent flurry of rants about ranting. 
 This thing is not yet chiseled into the stone tablets, so if we want to wordsmith it a little, now is the time. 
 Any word structure I use below that sounds like I've already decided what we're gonna do is just for my own sanity & convenience. 
 I think this might be a reasonable solution to the rant situation, and am honestly seeking input, and if possible, consensus or agreement. 
 "Rant threads must provide a useful outcome."
 "Printers suck."
 "Screw you Adobe."
 "My users are so stupid."
 "Does anyone else work with stupid managers?"
 "I had a crappy day today." 
 As they appear right there, none of those threads provide the community with a lesson to be learned or a tip or trick to be discussed. 
 All of those threads (assuming there is no meaningful content in the body of the thread) will now be subject to removal upon discovery or reporting. 
 However, versions of those same threads that provide the community with some kind of a lesson or tip or trick or benefit IN THE OP are safe from removal. 
 This applies to threads that are not asking for assistance. Threads that express frustration while describing a problem, as part of a request for assistance are also safe from removal. 
 A rant that basically ends with a "does anybody else agree?" is just a rant seeking affirmation and is subject to removal. 
 We've expressed a desire to provide at least some leeway to members of the community to use this as a bit of a water cooler to vent since so many of us are working from home full-time now and have no peers to vent to. 
 I think we can dial that back and direct those members towards the IRC or Discord channels since those are far more water cooler like environments anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a mid sized global company. Myself and my counterpart at another location handle all of the equipment returns for all of the US. We have users returning differing amounts of equipment including laptops, monitors, monitor stands, printers, docks, and cell phones. My counterpart has a very adept shipping department that customizes the boxes they send with a lot of packing material, but it requires back and forth with the user to determine how many boxes and what size to send.
 I don't have an adept shipping department. Currently, I have people go straight to UPS or fedex and use our account information to have them pack and ship it all, eliminating any back and forth with the user and doesn't force the user to pack at all. Recently I've had issues with UPS not allowing people to use our account information, but I hate the idea of chasing down users to get all the dimensions needed, then being a middle-man with the shipping department to get everything coordinated. 
 I feel like the easiest way for us is to have a concur account for users so they can just get reimbursed for shipping equipment back, but I would need to convince my boss of this. 
 How do you handle equipment returns?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My security department wants to move to security tokens. There are 2 security tokens they are looking at. One is a 25 dollar Yubico Security Key, the other is a 50 dollar Yubikey 5. The main difference for me is the 50 dollar one has a serial number and the 25 dollar one does not have an internal number to track them. I am in charge of inventory for these items. My IT director wants to deploy the 25 dollar version to OVER 1200 EMPLOYEES. When I brought up issues tracking these, he told me I could just sharpie asset numbers on them. I honestly don't even know what to say. When I brought up issues with this (like what if one rubs off and is left in a computer) he said "well what if one breaks, the nfc serial number wouldn't help us anyways" and I'm just.... flabbergasted. I need to find a way to convince them the extra 30k is worth it. I just don't think he wants to listen and I don't know what to say to him.
 Edit: To answer a few questions. 
 1) I do use an inventory tracking system. It's been in place for years, I got here a year ago and have sine integrated it into our processes for more automatic tracking. 
 2) our privacy department says we HAVE to track these. 
 3) having someone spend days writing serial numbers is not only a waste of time, its degrading.
 Edit 2:
 1) a lot of great points. I really appreciate everyone who has brought some good ideas to the table. 
 2) I was obviously a little ranty when I wrote this. Short of engraving identifying marks on these, I have tested he longevity of any solutions we have come up with. These go in and out of pockets, are touched by hand sanitizer hands, rubbing on clothes. In the week I've tested them none stay on. I am getting a HARD rule that I need to track these. 
 3)I think I am going to try to have one more discussion (or sending an email) with my director explaining my reservations. I appreciate everyone's insight.

 I got one ebgp client and I need to isolate it from my master routing table.
 So, I will use vrf but I'm not sure what type of VRF I need to use.
 It must be separate routing table with some routes imported from master routing table and to export client routes from vrf table to master routing table.
 For my opinion it can be virtual-router.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I am trying to setup a VLT between two Dell S4148F-ON switches running OS 9. I've been looking at the two links below and both seem to have slightly different setups.
 https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-za/dell-emc-os-9/s4048-on-9.14.2.5-config-pub/vlt-sample-configuration?guid=guid-f4e8722a-bb94-4949-ae33-72aa715869c8&lang=en-us
 https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000118094/how-to-set-up-virtual-link-trunking-vlt-on-dell-networking-os9-force10-switches
 A couple area where I am confused is one link is talking about configuring a LAG/LACP port running on the port of the connected device but the other link seems to indicate only for the links designated for VLT peering. The other area is adding (a fake?) MAC address (to both?) switches so that during a reboot of one, the other registers it faster?
 What I will be using this switch for is vSAN and vMotion. I will be using the same 10GB NICS but using a separate vlan and IP subnet for each service. We want to use VLT and not stacking so that we can update (if needed) the switched independently. but I am confused on the proper way to create a VLT.
 Thank you.

 So, big project. I'm the Linux admin and the team and the vendors are having issues installing an Oracle package. I'm very finicky with specifics. I require people to put the hostname in the ticket (matches with the database in ServiceNow, the hostname on the server itself, the aws/vmware location, DNS, Red Hat Satellite, etc) I also require the employee number along with the name of the user with issues so I can 'su' as them and recreate the issue.
 I've got this one VP who is very technical but lazy with documentation. He messaged me on teams and asked me to check my email. I was busy with another project so I asked him to open a ticket. He opened a generic ticket, assigned directly to me, and put "Forwarded you an email with all relevant information".
 This email was over 40 replies deep and covering not just that information, but about the whole project. Don't make me wade through pages and pages of info. PUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED IN THE TICKET! 
 Drives me nuts. Anyone ever have this type at your place?

 I've recently joined a small team and while they're generally well-organized, I've noticed a significant issue right off the bat: the use of bastions with whitelisted home IP addresses.
 At my previous job, we utilized Zscaler ZIA, which was functional but not without its flaws. However, the requirement for FedRAMP compliance was the driving factor there, which isn't relevant in my new role.
 I've had positive experiences with Zerotier and Netmaker due to their user-friendly interfaces and fast performance. However, I'm here to seek your valuable insights.
 In our current setup, we have multiple environments spread across various VPCs, many of which are interconnected.
 What are people's setups? Thanks in advance!

The question is if a user's password is expired, does the network will automatically unauthenticate? If true, does that mean the user cannot login to the computer even if an administrator provided a new password after expiry since the computer has no network access? Thank you.

 18 576.758740 172.22.26.202 192.168.190.2 TCP 70 [TCP Retransmission] 51561 → 443 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=256 SACK_PERM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone seen a tool that diagnoses connectivity and access control problems so that you could combine the tricks that nslookup, ping, telnet, curl, s_client and such do, plus some access control checks?
 Ideally it would take a DNS or IP address or URL and a port number or maybe some other syntax for login or (network API) endpoints, with some specified credential syntax and a some resource specification and tell me the result of these test, and diagnostics of the status of success or failure:
 Does it resolve from DNS?
 Does arp or ping or "nmap -sn" heuristics work (to try a few common TCP ports)?
 Can you get any response (TCP or ICMP) or is there just silence?
 Can you get traceroute info?
 Is there a firewall?
 Can you open TCP?
 Can you open an HTTP connection, or other protols?
 Is there a proxy?
 Can you negotiate TLS, if relevant?
 Can you login, or open other sessions, as relevant?
 Can you access the resource referenced?
 It could test the explicit credentials specified, it could use your HTTP (or other) cookies and your OS specific session state like Windows Kerberos tickets or cloud specific session state files. Regerdless if you succeed or not it could report how are you named after the session is open and what rights/roles/entitlements does your user identifier have. (Of course this soon becomes very application specific.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have inherited 3 x /24 networks, with plenty of devices, but no DHCP :(
 These devices are not computers. All different models and vendors. We're deploying windows dhcp, the devices need to remain on the same IPs due to some being used in poorly documented programming.
 The devices are individually configured, static. They do a combo of ping and consult a half completed spreadsheet when adding devices. (yes this is madness).
 Yes the devices are spread all over the IP ranges.
 My question is: to rollout smoothly, can we create reservations for each device in DHCP containing the current static IP and then organise for the device owners to switch to dynamic and restart the devices when they can? Is there any risk from having the reservation for device while the device is still static?
 or, what is the better way?

 When simply wanting to chat in Teams when typing the email address I get 2 results:

 - second one with "(External)" at the end which shows the user online.
 But, in the Teams group or channel I get only the "(Guest)" user.
 ​
 I have all the backend settings correct:
 - External collaboration: Guest users have the same access as members + Anyone in the organization can invite guest users including guests and non-admins + Allow invitations to be sent to any domain;
 - Teams admin center: Guest access is ON;
 - Microsoft 365 Groups Org settings: Let group owners add people outside your organization to Microsoft 365 Groups as guests + Let guest group members access group content;
 - SharePoint organization level sharing settings: Anyone;
 - SharePoint organization level default link settings: Anyone with the link
 - The Team is Private so that only invited users can be a part of it;
 - SharePoint site-level sharing settings: New and existing guests;

 Do you know what's causing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, we had an issue at work where a subset of our devices were unable to join our production SSID/Wi-Fi network. 
 While on the troubleshooting bridge, a network engineer starts poking around in the configuration for this SSID. He notices the security protocol was somehow set to WPA-3 across all of our AP’s. We change the protocol back to WPA-2, push the update to an impacted site, and our subset of devices immediately rejoin the Wi-Fi. 
 Several hours later, the engineer says he checked the logs and he seems to have been the only person in the Extreme console who made any changes since the beginning of July. Per the engineer, the logs don’t mention when or how this setting was changed. He said it was possible that this protocol change was queued up for deployment, and went out when he rotated the PSK on our guest Wi-Fi network. 
 My question: is what the engineer mentioned true? Do the logs really not show when or how this was changed? Do changes somehow get queued up without anyone noticing? Did the engineer mess up and now he’s hoping to just sweep this under the rug? (this is not the first time something like this has occurred)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I am a sysadmin that does pretty much everything (allrounder) although networking certainly isnt my favorite aspect of the job. Currently we have a mix of HP/Aruba Switches (very old ones) and a cisco wireless controller with cisco access points (not super old) that we are not that happy with, mostly because they are a pain to manage. We have a MSP helping out, but they are also struggling and we are generally not happy with their service.We have a palo alto firewall and that will be staying, its really cool.
 My manager told me for the new office space we have a decent amount of budget and can fit new equipment to my liking - however I am not sure what is best. I looked at ubiquiti and their stuff seems easy to manage which is definitely a plus.
 We dont do that much: VLANs, WiFi with Active Directory Logins and Guest WiFi are the most needed features. Should be high availability (redundant power at least) and it would be great if the switches and the APs work well with each other.
 What do you guys run networking wise? What would you do if you had a blank canvas to start with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, we have two RRAS servers, both have dual interfaces. One NIC in the DMZ and another in the internal segment. Both servers have the default gateway on the DMZ nic and a route added to the LAN Nic to point back to our internal network. The DMZ interfaces are using MS NBL and share an IP. Our static route from the outside points to this NLB IP. My questions is on the internal subnet that the clients recieve. Both RRAS servers have a static IP Pool in the same subnet. However, the route internally can either point to RRAS LAN nic on a single server. 
 Public IP-->Static NAT-->DMZ(NLB)
 RRAS-1--(LAN)-->10.4.4.10 --Client route 192.168.1.0/24 10.4.40.10
 RRAS-2--(LAN)-->10.4.4.11-- Client Route 192.168.1.0/24 10.4.40.11 
 ​
 Otherwise, we can just give each RRAS server their own client subnets and this works fine but each time the client disconnects they will get a new IP. 
 Public IP-->Static NAT-->DMZ(NLB) 
 RRAS-1--(LAN)--10.4.4.10 --Client route 192.168.1.0/24 10.4.40.10
 RRAS-2--(LAN)--10.4.4.11-- Client Route 192.168.2.0/24 10.4.40.11

 Previously it errored (saying the application was disabled) I enabled the application in Azure so users can sign in, just to stop the error.
 But now it wants all users to sign in.
 How do I turn it off completely, I don't want it, they run their own print server with printers deployed via GPO the good old fashioned way.
 TL:DR How do I completely bin off universal printing from RDS servers.

 I'm seeking assistance regarding an issue with our server, and I'm hopeful that you could provide some insight. We have encountered a problem involving a specific user who reported an inability to perform copy/paste actions between the RDP server and their local machine. Intrigued, I decided to investigate the matter personally, only to discover that indeed, the functionality is not functioning as expected.
 My quest for solutions led me to attempt terminating the RDP Clip Monitor service via the Task Manager. Regrettably, this endeavor yielded no positive results.
 It's worth noting that our company employs BitDefender as our security solution, although I currently lack access to the administrator console. Could it be plausible that BitDefender is impeding the functioning of rdclip.exe? In such a case, would it be prudent to add rdclip.exe to the exclusion list?
 I am truly hoping that your expertise and experience might shed some light on this situation. Your assistance would be immensely appreciated. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow sysadmins
 We're in the middle of migration to Sharepoint from our ancient file servers. I was aware of the SP limitations and went with this bit regarding OneDrive path lenghts (we sync the libraries to pcs):
 "The length of the OneDrive root folder (e.g. C:\users\meganb\OneDrive - Contoso) + the relative path of the file (up to 400 chars) cannot be more than 520 characters."
 Turns out I can't open any file from synced library if its path is longer than 260 characters which changes things dramatically. I am aware of Windows max path etc. but my question is did MS got their doc so wrong and forgot to mention Windows max path or I am missing something here?

 Boss has been putting me under serious pressure to remove the license agreement text from some open-source software we use because he doesn't want the client to know that it's free. Never mind that removing the license is a breach of said license.
 I've held up so far with arguments varying from "I don't know how..." to "that's illegal, and as a coder myself I won't remove attribution from someone else's code so you can make more free money from it!"
 He tries to justify it by saying "we're paying for server costs!" and "what are the chances of them finding out really?"

 - Taking on a client with no office, only remote staff. Not a problem on it's own.
 - We use our own RMM/PSA that is built in house. None of that fancy Datto, N-Able or somesuch RMM over here.
 - Remote connections currently rely on VPN to our clients. Not authorised to use anything other than VNC. Of course I don't want to just use a separate remote access program for this client either.
 - Quick assist would be the short term dirty hack
 ​
 I'm thinking the only way to not get in this situation again is to advise we switch our remote access solution to something that uses a cloud based proxy. Any other recommendations?

 First time posting here. So I may not have the correct way to publish a post
 We have implemented Wired 802.1x (certifcate based) with NPS (Win Server 2019) in our company, everything is working fine with Windows 10. 
 We are now making some test to deploy Windows 11 but the connection goes wrong and we are not able to have a success with a former working Win10 laptop which migrate on Win11. 
 We have now a pop wich require action and we cannot success any authentication.. 
 ​
 The policy is pushed by GPO. We use the same policy for Win10 and Win 11. 
 We have tried the certificate way and user/pswd, same issue
 ​
 Have you ever experienced that ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand how NAT works in case of communication between one, local host and a server with specific public IP address. The host is sending a request, it pushes the packet with destination IP address set to the value of servers IP address to the router . That LAN router "remember" that our host (identified by private IP address) is sending request to the server. So it is able to forward the response from a server to the proper host. (By the way, how does it distinguish responses from the server when multiple hosts from one LAN send requests at the same time?)
 Now, lets say we have two hosts, based on two standard local networks on Internet, which are not related with eachother. Is it possible to these hosts to communicate with each other, with NAT, but without any kind of servers between, providing the services to communicate? In that situation, we dont need to send any kind of request between them.

A while ago the whole IT infrastructure team was fired and only I remained. No one was handling inventory and purchase requests, and after a while I'm out of laptops and general equipment like cables and what not and I am getting flack for things not working properly when I don't have equipment and I don't have a direct onsite superior that handles this, head of IT is ERP strictly and doesn't handle anything other then the ERP, they hired an IT director located on the other side of the globe that has no idea what's going on on-site. I'm standing my ground and insisting that these things are not under my responsibility and I am not supposed to be a replacement to a company employee. I got blamed for an employee getting injured because he tried climbing on a ladder to activate a conference pc instead of waiting for me to get there and set it up. I said I set it all up and needed no more then 5 minutes and I was there around 10 minutes before the meeting ,but they decided to do it anyways and then they rode on that to blame me for low meeting quality. The reality is the conferencing equipment is faulty and I had it all setup to work as best as it could, but because I don't even have a fucking printer cable I can't connect the microphone to the PC so audio quality sucks regardless of when I got there and they are insisting I'm the one not doing his job properly.

 What I want
 10.0/16 - admin (this has like one network ID, one or two hosts and broadcast, so this might only need to be /30)
 10.10.10/24 - main
 10.10.20/24 - guest
 10.10.99/24 -iot
 10.20.10/24 - rental1
 10.20.20/24 - rental2
 Am I just far off what’s normal here? Am I causing network lags by using two octants in vlans for separation?
 Should I for some reason try to limit the host-bits as much as possible for performance?
 My thinking is that the firewall rules will be simplified by not allowing 10.20 and 10.10 to speak to each other. I will also separate the other networks to not allow communication, however I am debating if I should allow 10.10 to speak to 10.99.
 Thanks in advance!

I receive a message “Please ensure that the port through which the device is managed has the proper settings and is a member if the new management interface”. I can understand that it means that I need to have a proper ip address for the pc so that I wont disconnect. But I don’t understand what does that mean. Because my ip address is 10.10.10.1 and my vlans ip address is 10.10.10.254 . But as soon as I say yes to that above bold message my switch disconnects. I hope I was clear.

Our VP recently received some complaints that our i-Series server is taking forever to run database queries (2 min+) and telnet sessions are lagging. They are convinced it's a network issue as pings from user desktops and other servers to this i-Series server are getting occasional 4-15ms response times. I am being told these ping results are unacceptable and must consistently be 1ms or less as it's a local server and it was always <1ms before it was moved to a vlan from a flat network. The server in question is running on a 4x1gb lacp agg and there are no port errors to be found. The uplink on the switch is 10gb and operating nominally. Am I crazy for thinking these expectations are ridiculous? Out of all my testing I can't find any reasonable evidence to suggest this is a network issue.

After doing a packet trace I could see that the window size was requested to increase a few times before it died.
 I tried setting the sysctl settings net.core.wmem_max and net.core.rmem_max from 212k to 12M. This did resolve the issue. Now I'm left wondering if I should just modify this on all of our servers, look at reducing the window size Netscaler sends, or if something is wrong with the calico k8s internal networking.
 I'm curious if anyone has ran into a similar issue and how they solved it. Ideally I'd like to tune the environment for the fastest transfers, but not at the risk of causing new issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, apologies if this isn't the right forum.
 Background: 
 For the past few years I've been teaching technology at a small private school. Our computer lab is a steaming hot mess that I've pretty much ignored as we have a 1:1 chromebook program. The lab has a bunch of half-functional ancient PC's, many of which I never had the admin password to. We also have a bunch of ancient ipads that were a PITA (set up with like 10 different itunes accounts, & near zero documentation). 
 Current Technology:
  
We have Cisco/Meraki networking service which I am not involved in managing.
 
Internet provided by Comcast
 I personally use Google Admin to manage google accounts & chromebooks. My experience here is basically setting up accounts/resetting passwords, and adding certain chrome plugins/apps.
 
100+ issued chromebooks.
  
We are supposedly on tap to receive a dozen+ brand new HP desktop computers (and a number of new ipads) for the lab and I would like to avoid the sh*t show that was the previous computer network that just used single, local, "student" accounts along with a (poorly documented) admin account.
 I've done a bit of research and I'm wondering if a combination of the Meraki Systems Manager and Google Credential Provider for Windows could provide for an adequate solution without having to set up an Active Directory server (which I have no experience with). 
 Having students use their Chromebook login to access the desktops would be IDEAL. So I was very excited to learn about GCP for Windows. And the Meraki Systems Manager seems to offer a very robust set of features. 
 ​
 TLDR: Here are my ultimate questions
 1) Am I on the right track with wanting to go the route of Meraki Systems Manger + Google Credential Provider for Windows? 
 2) What kind of configurations/settings should I make sure to enable for PC's in a school computer lab?

When I look at Lab Management, there are 2 labs with the same name, and one has disk space usage equivalent to the original lab, but I can't get to it. No matter which lab I click to open, it always takes me to the new one with no config. THe UUID of the labs are different, but i'm worried I'm going to lose all my configs in the original lab. Anyone know of a solution to get my original lab back?

Windows Server is not preinstalled so I assume I'll need to get an ISO and install it myself. No problem except from where do I actually get the ISO? 
 HPE support told me to go to the Microsoft eval center where you can get an evaluation of Windows Server 2022. You can get an eval key. Can I use my actual license key with the eval ISO? I seem to remember you can't do this. Instead you need to install and activate the eval key, and then use some command line voodoo to convert the edition and insert your actual product key.
 Is this really the standard practice way to get Windows installed on a brand new server? (I bought the Windows license when I ordered the servers, which is why they came with the Microsoft product key sticker)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm helping a local charity setup a Wi-Fi network in a community hall, as a bit of background we are re-opening the hall as it has been left unmaintained for the last 3-4 years. The charity has very limited funds and there are a few essential repairs that need to be made. Adding wifi is currently sitting in the nice to have category rather than essential, we do have existing network cables running through the building which I am hoping we can leverage.
 I've reached out to a few vendors and asked for their recommendations, but the products they are recommending are Wi-Fi 6 - Our budget won't stretch that far and I also think WiFi 6 is going to be excessive for our needs.
 Our internet traffic will be 1-2 staff PC's and a point of sale terminal, there will be a free guest Wi-Fi service but this doesn't need to be superfast to begin with. All traffic is going to be going out over the internet, with very limited traffic within the local area network.
 From a hardware perspective I think we need 4 access points and a PoE switch (So they are easier to install). I'm think of going with the TL-SG105PE switch, this provides Gigabit speed, 65W of power and its managed (The unmanaged option is only £7 cheaper). For the access points I'm debating between EAP115 and EAP225, the EAP225 is obviously faster and futureproof but its obviously a bit more expensive, I cold start with an EAP115 and then upgrade to EAP225 at a later date and reuse the EAP115 somewhere else in the building if we needed to.
 A couple of other factors, our internet on day 1 will probably only be 150Mbps but if the demands grows quickly then this will be upgraded so I'm trying to balance futureproofing with budget.
 Also I need to check what type of network cable is currently installed in the building, if its only Cat 5 then that will obviously be a limiting factor for any Gigabit hardware we have.
 I'd appreciate any comments/feedback people might have.

 Is this possible with the CUBE?

 What is important though is to allow the managers to edit the web pages in order to display deals and general information. Currently the service has a login that they login with to update the information on the main page. This needs to be fairly simple and intuitive and the manager shouldn't be able to edit other pages or change major characteristics about the site like the title or the theming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Curious to get some opinions. We have an aging physical file server that needs to be migrated. This server has about 200GB of data, 120,000 files, and 10,000 folders. Currently, everyone is set up to use a mapped drive to access their documents.
 I like the idea of creating a SharePoint document library and migrating all the shares up -no more servers or updates to manage. However, I'm concerned about the user experience with the lack of a mapped drive. Microsoft used to support mapping a drive to a document library, but they’ve moved away from that technology. I tested syncing the main share to my local OneDrive, but the overhead of syncing that large of a folder was terrible. It seems that any large folder adds significant overhead for syncing to OneDrive. I'm concerned about mass-deploying that. 
 What path would you take? Would you move forward with migrating to SharePoint or spin up a new Windows server VM and keep the current on-prem server and mapped drives?
 Roughly 100 people will need access to these files. All users have Office 365 E3 licenses.

I am not a system admin at all, I am in my second year of IT with a bachelors in IT and I am in my main learning phase. I feel really out of my element and am questioning if I know anything about IT everyday lol.
 The system I inherited is a server room with 7 servers, a mail server, dns, etc. We have 4 locations.
 My supervisors want to move to cloud and office365. We don't even have AD anywhere in this place. It isn't like this is a small business either, about 150 users day to day. (nonprofit)
 I have experience supporting these environments, but I have never built one from scratch. I am both excited and scared for the challenge! I guess my question is where do I start?
 My first step was to get every computer on the same version of windows which I have just recently completed (one of my older coworkers was using XP)
 I was going to start by building AD for the business to have some control over what we have, but since we are moving to the cloud I was questioning if we leave on prem behind? I am a proponent of more of a hybrid system, but my higher ups really want to push for a full cloud based system(Pretty sure htey just like the buzzword and don't actually know what that entails). I have read online that most people prefer a hybrid solution, but that's mostly when they are upgrading their system, not starting from scratch. I have a chance to build the system exactly how I want here I just have no idea where to start!
 I would be appreciative of any suggestions or ideas! I am going through this solo and would love the support (:
 ​
 ​
 EDIT: Thank you for everyone who gave suggestions, I am more excited than nervous now haha. I wish you all the best!

Your sales rep may have been let go yesterday and with that you'll be shuffled around to a new rep. Dell is once again doubling down on using VARs like ours to support their customer base from a sales/sourcing perspective. They will be paying the existing reps more on their commissions to drive you to buy from VARs so they can support more customers at a lower cost.
 If you are not buying from a VAR today, reach out to a trusted VAR and get that relationship going for your Dell hardware. At least have this as a back up as more and more fat is going to be trimmed at Dell we are hearing and this is just the first axe. 
 Happy to answer any questions on what I know, but here's the main industry article with more details: https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/dell-layoffs-linkedin-posts-show-job-axe-falls-hardest-on-sales

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm configuring an ASA for one of our lab environments. It's been awhile since I've touched an ASA.
 I have 11 Subinterfaces configured on one interface. Each subinterface has a vlan and subnet configured on it. All subinterfaces need to communicate with each other. They are all security-level 100 (though, I have tested lowering the security level of one and testing between...didn't work).
 I do have 'same-security-traffic permit inter-interface' configured.
 An example of the configuration is:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/7
 description Connected to SW100 GigabitEthernet0/1
 no nameif
 no security-level
 no ip address
 !
 interface GigabitEthernet1/8.10
 description Management VLAN
 vlan 10
 nameif Management
 security-level 100
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
 !
 interface GigabitEthernet1/8.20
 description Location A VLAN
 vlan 20
 nameif LocationA
 security-level 100
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 !
 I can ping the default gw of each network when I am on that network. However, I cannot communicate between them. I have also tried creating extended ACL's to allow the communication, and that is not working either. (I also attached the access groups to the interfaces).
 What am I missing here?
 EDIT:
 It's likely my traffic has been working for a while it seems.
 However, I had at least two problems regarding the tests. 
 1.) I needed to add some icmp permits
 2.) I was testing the connectivity by pinging the default gw's, which is apparently not supported from other networks. Once I had devices permanently on the other networks, I was able to ping those addresses and verify connectivity.
 Massive headache...but it's working.
 Thanks for the help all!

Starlink doesn't offer Static IPs and unless you have the business plan you don't even get a routable IP. Because of this, I don't believe we could use an IPSec because of the need for static IPs but instead the idea is to use a SSL/TLS Site-to Site VPN. 
  
Is an SSL/TLS Site-to-Site VPN the only option because of the lack of static or routable IPs?
 In AWS, would you do this via an AWS Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) or would you set up an OpenVPN Access Server? What are the pros and cons?
 
If using the VGW, what software FW (or any client SW) would you put on the client side? Like a pfSense or IPFire?

They are not ending up in spam folder they are simply getting dropped. When I check our mail server logs it’s showing accepted and delivered on our end. So I sent a few emails to our sales department which uses outlook and sure enough they never are delivered. I logged into admin.exchange.Microsoft and I see the emails are now ending up in quarantine. I checked the obvious things SFP DKIM DMARC etc and all is authenticated aligned and no issues to note. To get us by I signed up for send grid and we’re having the same issues. I opened up a ticket with Microsoft and they said they would escalate this issue. Is anyone having the same issues? I see no reason for our emails so be marked as high risk. Any recommendations ?

 ​
 Let's take a DFS-share: \domain.local\Data\Share1 that is hosted on \filer01\share and \filer02\share
 Is it sufficient to execute:
 setspn -S cifs/domain.local filer01

 setspn -S cifs/domain.local/Data filer01
 or something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: I am a sysadmin, but with no qualifications or deep interest in networking - definitely my shortcoming.
 Our company has a lot of different branches. Some are connected to our main network through MPLS, and some are connected through different types of site to site 2 site tunnels - mostly Sophos RED boxes.
 A bunch of them has RED15 boxes, which are EOL in a few weeks, so they need to be replaced, as our MSP says they first will be a security problem, and next will stop working completely.
 The MSP has recently replaced their network people, and all I hear about now is Fortinet. As a replacement, they are suggesting Fortigate site 2 site products with UTP, which I am sure are great, but it also mean doubling to tripling the branches network costs.
 When I ask for alternatives, I am told there are none, and that if we picked something else, it would be lacking a lot of important security, which pretty much leaves me with no other options, which I'm questioning, as I feel it comes down to the network technicians religion.
 I know software VPN could do the trick on each of the computers, but then there is printers at all branches with various types of pull printing, which needs to be connected to the main network as they are installed on the print server.
 Do you guys see any alternative solutions that won't require us to break the bank? How about a SD-WAN solution?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 Backstory: I've been administrating on prem Exchange for 20 years. We are being forced into M365 licensing due to costs, and our M365 tier includes Exchange. We would be foolish to double dip licensing to maintain an on prem server. 
 Exchange is hosted on VMWare. We have a 3rd party email security gateway and KB4. Veeam for backups. We are a split DNS AD environment. 
 I am working towards my certs to manage Exchange in the cloud. However, we are moving fast on this and I am not going to be ready in time. I know enough to know that I don't know enough. I need a reliable company that can architect the transition and assist with the migration. 2k users, about 2 TB of databases (we are in a regulated environment where we maintain all email for a very long time). 
 Looking for recommendations. Thank you!

 When faced with an Onboard Administrator (OA) module replacement on a C7000, you may encounter a situation where the replacement module comes with a vastly out of date firmware.
 In this example, we have an active Onboard Administrator (OA) module running firmware version 4.97, with a replacement module running firmware version 3.11.
 When plugging in the replacement module, you would be presented with a Standby Onboard Administrator in a degraded state, with messages such as:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! We've been using Bitlocker for about 3 years now after moving away from DDPE. Everything worked great up until a yearish ago. We always know the day after patch day now because it inevitably triggers our fleet of laptops to request a bitlocker recovery key. It didn't use to do this and it isn't the same people every time. We're a Dell shop, so I've contacted Dell and they sent me some support articles* that I had already found and tried on my own, but of course they didn't help. Dell was real quick to flip it around and say "Microsoft problem. We don't control Bitlocker."
 Had our MS admin put in a ticket with MS and of course they said "no one else is reporting this, must be a Dell issue." Rinse/Repeat a few times as I've been getting more and more frustrated. Sometimes it even happens not during the patch week but we always just assumed those are the stragglers who never reboot.

 Does anyone have suggestions on things to try? Are there alternatives to Bitlocker people are using? We're a State agency so all portable devices have to be encrypted. (and it's good practice anyway)

 I wrote a KQL query to check for ASR Rules being hit that are set to audited mode. Now if ido this KQL query in Advanced hunting I get no results. However i find it weird that with 610 devices there are no hits. Also i created a powershell today that should trigger a wmi event subscription but also no hit so far in Defender. How long does that take to sync? What am i doing wrong?
 Below is the code.
 DeviceEvents | where ActionType in ( 'AsrExecutableEmailContentAudited', 'AsrExecutableOfficeContentAudited', 'AsrAdobeReaderChildProcessAudited', 'AsrObfuscatedScriptAudited', 'AsrOfficeChildProcessAudited', 'AsrOfficeMacroWin32ApiCallsAudited', 'AsrOfficeProcessInjectionAudited', 'AsrPsexecWmiChildProcessAudited', 'AsrUntrustedExecutableAudited', 'AsrRansomwareAudited', 'AsrUntrustedUsbProcessAudited', 'AsrVulnerableSignedDriverAudited', 'AsrScriptExecutableDownloadAudited', 'AsrPersistenceThroughWmiAudited', 'AsrOfficeCommAppChildProcessAudited' ) | project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, AccountName, AccountDomain, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine | order by Timestamp desc 
 ​
 Powershell used on a test device under normal user no admin.
 ## Create a hit for WMI Event Subscription Create a test WMI event subscription $Query = "SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 5 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_LogicalDisk' AND TargetInstance.DeviceID = 'C:'" Register-WmiEvent -Query $Query -SourceIdentifier "TestWMIEvent" -Action { Write-Host "Test WMI event triggered" } 
 Unregister-Event -SourceIdentifier "TestWMIEvent"
 How do you guys test this?
 ​
 Small notice: If i change one of the asr rules to Blocked (we do have some rules also set to blocked) I DO get hits.

 I am currently in China doing a manual refresh of our University campus machines. As there is no back end infrastructure such as SCCM or AD (I know), we have been using USB sticks to build machines.
 Today we noticed that a lot of machines refused to boot from USB, despite the BIOS being configured to do so. It seemed like some sort of third-party bootloader was hijacking the boot process. 
 Upon inspection of a machine I noticed a strange PCIE card. Removing the card allowed a normal USB boot, and for our image to.be applied to the machine - and removed the weird bootloader.

 My question is: what is this device? Have you encountered or used one yourself? What are the security implications of this device?
 Thanks !

 I’m stumped on an issue. We’ve got a user account on the domain that should only be able to save to USB memory sticks, not able to save to their home drive or profile area (Desktop/Documents/Pictures/Videos/etc). I’ve got it sorted for their home drive but whatever I try they can still save to their profile area.
 I have tried applying Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> System Security -> File System. I’ve tried putting %UserProfile%\Desktop and just Desktop. In GPResult I can see the policy is being applied and that it’s saying Deny Full Control but I am still able to create new files in that area. We just want a message box to say error or permission denied, something so that they cannot leave it there and log off.
 Any help appreciated please. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is planning on using ServiceNow and their CMDB. Obviously filling the asset database with computer system information, their software etc. needs to be automated.
 I've audited and played with their discovery methods. Either it requires WMI or, PSSession w/ admin privileges, or custom made JEA session configuration. Obviously I was more interested in Just Enough Administration. Their rule capabilities file allows just for one custom made function which creates a script block with any lines of code you pass to it and then executes it in a separate workspace thus acting as pure privilege escalation.
 Digging deeper I've added logging of each and every payload they send into that function and they send a couple of their own PS modules, binaries, dlls, and even C# code which they compile on the fly. Apart from that they use wmic.exe to name a few.
 Do any of you have experience with ServiceNow and their Discovery solution, and does anyone think it's not a reason to be concerned? Is it a common practice to grant systemwide access to such solutions via PowerShell+JEA or should it be considered a major security concern?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys
 I hope youre doin fine? 
 I have a very strange Problem. 
 I create GPO-rules for deleting shortcuts from desktop.
 If the shortcut ist on the users desktop, the command looks like:
 - %username%\Desktop\Google Chrome.lnk
 This works !!
 ​
 But when the shortcut is on the public desktop, the command should be like this:
 - C:\Users\Public\Desktop\AnyDesk MSI.lnk
 or
 - %public%\Public Desktop\AnyDesk MSI.lnk
 ​
 But when I write "gpupdate /force" in the command line, just the GPO for the users desktop works, public doesnt.
 ​
 I have also searched the internet and also followed step for step the video tutorials. No success...
 ​
 Do you know that it can be?
 ​
 Thanks and sorry for my bad english...
 ​
 Regards
 Volkan

I have created a mapped drive that was placed on the desktop through group policy. In my infinite wisdom, I did not use item level targeting on the shortcut to select the security group that should be the only ones with access. Now, everyone has the shortcut on their desktop but only those in the security group can actually access it. I have updated the GPO shortcut to have the correct targeting. What is the best way to remove the shortcut from those who don’t have permissions in this scenario? Unfortunately, the drive is not mapped to the same letter for everyone. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

 I am currently in a position where we have to manage a site with no local IT, a severe language barrier as well as 12h of time shift.
 I am trying to find a solution where we could do troubleshooting remotely, in cases we need to access BIOS or troubleshoot an issue that occurs while booting. Basically, no access to the operating system.
 I am wondering if there is a device that would add a similar feature as a server remote viewing feature like a iDRAC on a server, that could be provided with USB-C. Ideally, a dongle with a network port that has an IP configured on it, that we could remote into and have a keyboard/mouse/monitor.
 Is there such a product that exist on the market?
 Open to other ideas.
 Thanks!

She said she had been working there for 2.5 decades, and had 2 managers telling her they don't do this. 
 Obviously there has to be a way I can get in touch with someone who can change my IP's rDNS, but IDK where to go. Is there a specific line or department that's known to be able to do this?

 I have not “terminated” fiber ever, have used a fusion splicer couple of times though. Is this a skill that all network engineers have? I’ve searched videos and it all seems somewhat basic, but requires good tools in the range of 2-3k. 
 Also, do you guys have tips and things I should know about fiber: IE - color coordination, troubleshooting, when to use specific connectors etc?? 
 Note that I do not intend to lie, rather show that I’m willing to pick this skill asap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Aware that SMF is yellow and MMF is orange / aqua (based on it's spec) and thats the primary reason for them being coloured so you can tell at a glance what you're dealing with.
 We operate a SMF only site, and with our copper estate we have different colour copper patch cables for different purposes and I started to think given we have a decent amount of fibre wouldn't it be good if we had the same colour options with our fibre (given we know it's SMF). E.g. red for spine to leaf, purple for external fibred APs etc.
 I've spoken to our fibre distribution partner who has suggested either velcro ties around bundles of cables or clips /labels which work to an extent but as with copper if you've got a big bundle of SMF, it can be very useful to identify a cable via its function.
 Draw backs as far as I can see:
  
cost of custom patch leads
 confusing the badgers out of anyone external who doesn't know about the colour schema.
 standards compliance
  
So the question! How do those of you that have masses of SMF manage fibre by function? Is coloured fibre patch leads absolutely crazy? 
 Thanks,
 NS

I'm familiar with 3rd party remote-hands like Indigo, but I have no experience with/knowledge of any types of companies that also supply outsourced helpdesk services.
 The problem is that the company I work for is a very small MSP operation with not enough staff to manage on-call work given the number of customers we have. The company is trying to hire more full time people (I myself am only there for a few months now) but we simply don't have enough for the workload. (Additional context: we're in Europe, not in the US, so the company can't just force full-time employees to do 24/7 on-call - which is great but exacerbates the coverage problem)
 If these kinds of 3rd party/contract help-desk companies exist, does anyone have any experience with dealing with them? How was it? Who should we avoid? How was access to network resources managed/controlled?

 I work in Canada and make $95kCAD salary per year in one of the most expensive cities.
 But whenever people from US talk about getting $140K+ USD with benefits for doing same or even lesser jobs, I get somewhat depressed and envious of others.
 And I can't even apply for any of those jobs in US for not having "green" card. I don't qualify for H1B1 for not having full bachelor's diploma. And I can't quit the job just to waste 4 years trying to finish up a degree in hopes of getting H1B1 sometime down the line.
 Does anyone else get Envy/depressed when people discuss their salary?

 Get a ticket in this morning from the customers "IT" team and I quote - 
 "We are unsure of your request to open ports as our team has never needed to. We cannot currently implement this as we have no one experienced enough to do it. How can we move forward"
 Fucking what? You're telling me some desk-jockey is sitting in a chair worth more than my office laptop and they.....they can't port forward? 
 Their ticket got shot down to my "Yea when I get there I'll get there pile" next to 5 other tickets from yesterday asking/refusing the most mundane things to get running. 
 How do you guys deal with people who are NOT meant to be in their positions? I feel like this is some type of god-complex issue but how is someone part of an "IT team" for a million dollar company and not understand their depth?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weird request I know. 
 I test PLC devices. I have a Dlink DGS-1210-10 switch specifically for the fact that it's fairly small, and I can configure MDI/MDIX manually through the web interface. This is a requirement for our testing, as we need to know it's our test device doing the AUTO part of MDI/MDIX or not. I also have a bunch of Stratix 5400's that'll do it, but they're huge beasts that don't fit in my backpack well. 
 The easy button is a cheap old hub with an uplink port. I get it. But I also need SNMP for some network scripting development in the future. I'm also hoping to include the MDI setting in that script.
 Do ya'll know of, or can look for, a switch with these manually-configurable options? I've spent hours trying to read webUI screenshots looking for these settings, since every company just advertises "Auto MDI, never worry about it again!" (Which is correct, but useless for me). 
 So, I need hands-on experience with a small, portable, configurable switch that has this weirdly specific option. I can buy another DGS1210, but there has to be more than one option out there. (also I hate the 120v plug for personal reasons, 5v/12v/24v preferred).

 This is a bass ackwards system that I just cannot get my brain to click with. I made a little progress, but I still don't understand how or why it works and I've been completely and totally lost with the errors that have popped up. (yes, I've googled until I was blue in the face) it's not that I don't WANT to do it, I really do, but I'm just wasting everyone's time. 
 'wasting everyone's time' - or should I just say fuck it, I said I can't do this, but it's the companies time to waste? Except I can't work like that. I need to feel like I've accomplished something and proud of my work. I've not been this lost since I was a kid and got lost trying upgrade from DOS 5 to 6.22.
 Edit: Thanks for the encouragement and tips. I feel a tiny bit less shitty about it now. I'm definitely going to check out macadmins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just discovered that our co-lo Cyxtera had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 2 months ago. The best part (in a cruel "of course this happens to IT" sort of way) is that my organization is currently in the middle of migrating its servers from company premises to their Toronto-based data center.
 We leased out racks at two separate Cyxtera locations for redundancy purposes. We decided to have both locations under Cyxtera to make it easier for us to manage our equipment but perhaps, we should have leased one location from Cyxtera and another location from another provider.
 I'm not too sure how to proceed and wanted to see what others' opinions are. Do we stay and just assume another data center company will scoop up Cyxtera and business as usual for us? Or should we diversify and seek out another Toronto-based company? Of course, the latter is attractive, but it's going to cost the business more (time, money, etc). I don't want to create unnecessary work for my team if this bankruptcy is going to have minimal impact. My hope is that another company scoops up Cyxtera; maybe they will change the portal for end-users, with little change here or there but nothing dramatic such as shutting down facilities, forcing us to scramble to find a new co-lo.
 For some context, we run the majority of our applications on-premise (mail, DB, in-house developed back-end apps, etc). Cloud would be too expensive for us. 
 Like I said, looking for other pragmatic opinions. Maybe even some recommendation for co-location providers in the Toronto area (we're based in Mississauga)?
 EDIT: I may have not been clear. My business is a customer of Cyxtera. I do not work for Cyxtera.

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

 I'm not convinced this is the correct community, but I'll give it a try. (Please guide me if not).
 I'm doing IT for a small nonprofit organization. The organization supports families that have medical circumstances. The goal of this organization is to guide the family with accurate referrals and recommendations without any side interests.
 The "client" seeking information is usually anonymous. Up to this point the information is gathered and stored in a large spreadsheet shared with the team. The information is split up into multiple sheets which have multiple tables for services contact info on each plus additional information.
 This isn't idle for data entry or for search and retrieval, as well as being too fragile for mistakes.
 I'm looking to move them to a robust system that is fit for this kind of entry and retrieval. I was looking into a CRM like Salesforce, this isn't a common use case for it, I'm wondering if this can work. Or is there a better solution?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working on this strange issue for a client for a while now and wanted to share with everyone since I beleve it will be resolved "soon". The client is trying to access godaddy.com from an Azure remote desktop server and was getting a 403 when accessing the site with this message: 
 Access Denied
 You don't have permission to access "http://www.godaddy.com/" on this server.
 Reference #18.d86bdc17.1687370848.137d991 
 I'll spare you the troubleshooting steps as I have been back and forth with Azure's support team and GoDaddy's chat support. While troublehsooting, I found this thread on GoDaddy's communicty page that was relivitly new reporting the same behavior i was seeing: 
 https://community.godaddy.com/s/question/0D58W0000ApjDChSQM/access-denied 
 I brought this to GoDaddy and Azure support's attention and found that the root cause is more than likely a large block of Microsoft's Azure IPs being blocked by an Akamai (Godaddy's Host) WAF. Azure support states they have a ticket open internally and will work directly with GoDaddy/Aakamai to resolve this issue. 
 This is the work around proposed by Azure's support if anyone is interested:
  
Leverage BYOIP(Custom IP address prefix (BYOIP) - Azure Virtual Network | Microsoft Learn) à Still needs testing ---- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/custom-ip-address-prefix
 Route Internet Traffic to On-Premise and leverage On-Premise ISP.
  
I'll update this post once resolved. Hope this helps.

 Long story short, I'm auditing a small/medium size business' domain for shortcomings with best practices/patching. This domain has their DC, File Server, and Exchange server (all WS2016/Ex16) and all of them have SMB 1 enabled.
 I don't want to break anything so I'm taking a slow approach to the removal. I first plan to run 
 Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB1Protocol $false 
 And probably let that stay off for a week or so for the "scream test".
 But I'm curious as to what Windows Admin Center is doing with their built-in SMB 1 Removal, and Audit SMB 1 connections. The (?) box states:
 **View and take action to remove the insecure SMB 1 protocol 
 But no where in the documentation can I find where this information gets collected and stored to "view". 
 Another option that I have no idea how it works or what it's doing is:
 Audit SMB 1 connections 
 There is nothing (so far) logged in Event Viewer on the WAC host
 Microsoft-ServerManagementExperience 
 This is a screenshot from the WAC webui showing the File Shares (SMB server) settings where this option is kept:
 Windows Admin Center - Settings - File shares (SMB server) Screenshot
 Does anyone here have any experience with using this feature/setting? If so, could you help shine some light on how it works and what it is/isn't doing for SMBv1 Servers/Clients. TIA.

 if i set as a trunk and a phone is not plugged in, but a PC is plugged straight in instead. should the data vlan be set to native??

I restored the Ipad but now its under activation lock. I talked with Apple support, basically I was told they need receipts and the EIN of the device. The Ipad is 2+ years old, I really dont want to trash it because we cant get the lock off it. Any ideas what I can do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning,
 Looking for a little input here on a weird situation I'm experiencing across a few different computers/DCs/Domains/Users
 PCs are all Windows 10 Pro on 22h2
 DCs are a mix but nothing older than 2016. Fully updated. (I know its not current.)
 My GPOs are the same across the board:Enforce Password History: 2 passwords rememberedMax Password Age: 180 DaysMin Password Age: 1 dayMin Length: 6 CharactersComplexity Requirements: EnabledI also have it reference a "banned password list" so they cant use general words.
 When an AD users password expires and they go to log into their PC they are prompted to change like normal. Enter current password, new password and confirmation of new password.
 They click the change password button and after a few seconds it comes back with "Unable to change password"
 They ARE meeting complexity requirements (I went as far as using the domain administrator password as a test. Among other passwords.)
 If we cancel the password change screen, select "Other User" and type in their username and password there they are prompted to change the password. Same screen. Current password, new password and confirmation of new password.
 However, this screen works.
 Now normally this work around would be fine unless you report to a boss like mine who sees this as an issue.
 Has anyone experienced a situation similar to this? I confirmed none of the DCs have KB50115(I forget the last two digits i apologize. Its been a morning.)
 Thanks Everyone :)
 ​
 EDIT: I have also attempted to reboot the machines to kill the active "session" on the local PC and the issue is still present.

 Literally every 2nd action I try do on the UI throws an error like "Oops, that failed", "That's like totally invalid", "Not serializable, bruv." -- Elaborate a bit? "Noooooo."
 This is the second tenant Ive tried to set up. I've abandoned the previous one after failing to rename the domain name of sharepoint with zero clue on how to move forward. (Google, Bing chat, ChatGPT had no clue either) -- lol I couldn't even delete this tenant, because even that has failed on multiple points.
 Now for the new organization MFA is just not working. The authenticator just scans it then nothing, not even an error message.

 2023-07-31 11:51:07, Error MOUPG CSetupManager::Execute(304): Result = 0x800705222023-07-31 11:51:07, Error MOUPG CSetupHost::Execute(463): Result = 0x80070522
 I've taken a number of troubleshooting steps, including trying the upgrade on multiple servers, removing them from the domain, utilizing local admin privileges, disabling UAC, and even temporarily uninstalling antivirus software. Unfortunately, all these efforts have led to the same persistent error.
 Has anyone in the community encountered a similar issue before or perhaps has insights into resolving this error? Your assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

 I'm reaching out for some guidance on a Microsoft 365 and Mimecast configuration challenge that I'm currently tackling as a new member of my company. My boss has entrusted me with the task of setting up internal signatures for all of our users, and while I've got the hang of external signatures, our CEO is keen on having the same functionality for internal communications.
 Now, here's where I could use your expertise: How can we go about achieving seamless internal signatures with Mimecast, mirroring the effectiveness of our external signatures? As far as I know, our external signatures are managed through Mimecast rather than Microsoft 365. Could we potentially explore the option of utilizing an additional third-party tool to streamline internal signatures?
 Your insights and recommendations would be immensely appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So....We recently changed our supplier for Single mode 30km 100mb SFP, and when my client received it, they noticed the TX power is now -4.4 dBm, but the ones they purchased before is -11dbm which is within the range on our datasheet -15~-8dBm. Our team overlooked the difference in Tx power, and I need to to damage control with my client.
 1.Could any experts on SFP give me the correct the formula to calculate the link budget for these 2 SFP modules? I want to check if the calculations could pass if I say we used Single mode 60km 100mb SFP.
 Our supplier told me Link Budget= Min Tx power - sensitivity 
 What I found online was Link Budget= Tx avg power- total loss+receiver sensitivity
  
Also is it Link Budget divide by 0.4 to get the maximum distance?
  
Wave Length 1310nm, Single mode 30km 100mb SFP
  
  Average Output Power Sensitivity Extinction Ratio PA-PD PA-PD 
  
 SFP1 -5~0 dBm -32 dBm 10  0.5 
  SFP2 -15~-8dBm -32 dBm 8.2 1.0  
 
 I wanted to post pictures of specs but couldn't.
  
What are the concerns for having a higher Tx power on the SFP? Signal Quality? Power Budget？Compatibility？Is there a way to turn this around as an upgrade?
  
I'm a rookie network product salesman and help would be greatly appreciated. Japanese clients are super sensitive to change without notice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone
 I was having a discussion with my colleague today about the AC Power Delay for a server.
 In a scenario where a company loses power and the UPS powers off the devices, I think that adding a 2-3 minute delay on the Power On would be good in case the electricty goes away again and again. Maybe it's rare, but I think it's better safe than sorry and we only lose 2 minutes. On the other hand my colleague was thinking about the fact that we work remotely and adding delay time may lead to thoughts like "it's broken/it won't power on" etc. and more downtime for the customer.
 What are your thoughts? I couldn't find best practices about this and I was wondering if everyone just keeps it at 0 and risk it to avoid losing time
 ​
 Thanks!

 I'm looking for some advice on selecting ODFs for a networking project inside a building. There are a wide variety of ODFs available, with different coupler types, pigtail types, slot counts, and densities.
 I have two questions about choosing ODFs and fiber optic cables.
 ​
  
If I choose a 1U ODF with 48 slots, I can only use 48 links if I choose SC couplers, but I can use 96 links if I choose LC couplers. In real life, most people here in my country choose SC couplers, which makes me wonder why. Is there a benefit to using SC couplers that I'm not aware of?
 We have two 72-core fiber optic cables, for a total of 144 cores. Should we use a single cable with 72 cores, or is it better to use two cables, one with 48 cores and one with 24 cores? I got one recommendation from cable supplier that we should go with two cables
 I need some input from experts here as designing L1 is very important and a bad design could make our lives hell.
  
Thanks in advance for your help!

 I had my current job for almost 3 years. Solo IT-Admin, one-man-army kind of employment.
 When i started the job, the IT was a complete disaster. We are talking passwords in spreadsheets, non-functional wifi, and so on.
 I´ve worked hard, and now everything works, almost everything is automated and i find myself spending the day scrolling Reddit, watching Youtube and so on.
 I think i have automated myself out of a job, and its time to move on to the next IT disaster.
 The company is at a point now, where the daily support can be managed by an external MSP, and i have slowly started to document everything in detail so they can take over when i leave.
 Have any of you guys been in the same boat before? How did you handle it?

 We have an Exchange Hybrid environment with a server 2016 VM used for Recipient management only (no SMTP relaying etc). We are currently looking at installing the updated Exchange management tools and shutting down the final Exchange server.
 The question I have is would it be a bad idea to install the management tools on a DC? Ordinarily, I would never consider installing anything other than AD roles on a DC but am thinking because the purpose of the tools is to administer AD attributes, this might be ok?
 The only requirement I can find is domain-joined Windows machine

 It doesn't actually do anything, it's not searching or finding any updates, We use SCCM for patching, so wondering if that is overwriting some settings.
 ​
 Policies enabled:
 Configure Automatic Updates (3 - Auto download and notify for install)
 Allow signed updates from an intranet Microsoft update service location
 Automatic Updates detection frequency (every hour)
 ​
 I can see on the Windows Update settings page it now says *We'll automatically download and install updates, except on metered connections (where charges may apply). In that case, we'll automatically download only those updates required to keep Windows running smoohtly.
 ​
 If I click the 'Check for updates' button, it finds and downloads/installs any updates completely fine.
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas?

 The way this was working initially was we had a NAS that hosted the file. Everyone would access the Nas and no file would be sorted on any of the pc’s. Recently we opened a branch in another country and so after talking to some network engineer from there he told us to get the MX68 for both sides of the network and to set up a site to site vpn to allow access for the other branch to the NAS and therefore allowing them to use the file as if they were in office.
 The struggle I’m having is the file will open here but not in the other branch. The latency of the vpn is +100ms. The internet speeds are a little affected and the ipsec policy apparently dosnt exist for this setup so we can’t see any computers on the other network. 
 I think that the vpn is set up incorrectly but I’m not sure because I thought hiring a professional would not bring me this problem. 
 Is this really a limitation of hardware or incompetent network engineer

 I have absolutely no idea how this has happened and Spamhaus aren't really too quick to wanting to remove it. I looked in the email headers and it seems the addresses that the emails come from (365 ones) for example 52.100.164.231 are on blacklists as well. Is this what is causing it?
 These customers are using HornetSecurity for email filtering, have they gone and messed something up? If i look up the domain in MXToolBox this is the list reasoning Reason for listing - No IP queries, see https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/Spamhaus%20DBL#279 but it isn't exactly forthcoming with information. Any help with this would be appreciated greatly as I have tried everything I can think of.

I'm not in a rush so I wanted to have both for a while until I am ready to migrate FSMO and then decommission the old DC.
 The AD environment still is heavily peppered with remnants of its origin in a 2003 SBS environment back when they had Exchange on-prem so there are GPOs and SG and all sorts of fun I'd never seen before. I thought I'd clean up some stuff in ADUC as it is not needed and the ADUC structure has OUs with no tiered structure and I'm moving everything around during this migration. I wish it were easy to just start over with a new clean Domain but it would be too much work as there's no RMM solution on the endpoints...
 TL;DR: I was cleaning up folders in ADUC and I deleted the "Managed Service Accounts" container... No backups, no snapshots... :( There was nothing in the folder which is why I deleted it before even thinking about it... How do I get it back? I found some guides and docs online that suggest the process is to use ADSI Edit to change some env variable in the domain then run AD prep from the OS install disk... I don't have the 2012 R2 ISO, only the 2022 install ISO. Is this the right method and/or does anyone have first-hand experience with this... or just other suggestions for the mess as I've described it.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I started a job at x-company and I was given a ticket about requesting some devices back from a few employees. Well, several months went by and a lot of requests were sent to get these devices back. One of them actually quit a few weeks ago and never turned in her laptop. I made every effort to get it back from her, including involving her supervisor - then also that person's supervisor. No results ever came of it. My supervisor and even the CIO know that this person took off from the company with one of our laptops with zero communication about whether they were going to return it. Now, my supervisor, the CIO and the main IT guy at our location is telling me I need to call her on her personal cell phone to ask for it back. My thing is, she wasn't giving the damn thing back when she worked here, she isn't going to give it back now. I also feel like this should be an HR issue at this point - not a person who is basically just help desk. What do I do? How do I tell the CIO and IT director I am not doing this because it's not my problem at this point?
 TLDR; ex employee still has a company laptop and everyone wants me to call and harass them for it back.
 edit : I'm going to have a chat with legal and HR tomorrow, thanks everyone for your helpful answers!

 As far as I can tell we have all our teams settings to allow us to message people in other companies via teams. My mode and the global mode is set to Teams only.
 When I search for someone that is not in our company by email I don't get the Search externally option. When someone I worked with searched they did; looking at our accounts in teams admin center they look like they have the same settings.
 
 I have 
 uninstalled/reinstalled team
 Cleared teams cache
 Tested on a different system with my account (not working)
 Tested new account (which works) on my system and another system
 Removed E3 license/Added it back
 
 So far none of this works my account is old before we moved to O365
 We also used to use Skype for business.
 Maybe a weird leftover setting in my attributes? Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/networking,
 I've read through the documents regarding the design of cables to be used inside the building, and I understand that it's best to use multi-mode fiber optic cable. If we need to connect to a building miles away, we need to use single-mode fiber optic cable.
 I understand the part about using multi-mode fiber optic cable inside the building, and I also understand the part about using single-mode fiber optic cable if we run it outside the building and connect to a faraway building.
 The part that confuses me is the part about interconnecting from the outside building to the inside building using the ODF or termination box. If I'm not mistaken, it's not possible to connect a single-mode fiber optic cable to a multi-mode fiber optic cable, because the core of a single-mode cable is 9 microns and the core of a multi-mode OM2 cable is 50 microns.
 Right now, I'm not sure what to do, because I have two suppliers: one from a telecommunications company and one from a cable company.
 - The telecommunications guy suggested that we use single-mode cable inside the building and multi-mode cable inside the data center. I agreed with him, because if we need to connect sites over a long distance, we'll need to use single-mode cable from the outside to the inside.
 - The cable guy suggested using multi-mode cable throughout the building, but he didn't give me a clear explanation of how we would connect the outside to the inside.
 So, what is the right design? Thanks for any input.
 ​
 ​
 Solution: Single mode is the right decision.

 However...I know if you tag the management VLAN as well, you can still get to the IP of the switch without a problem. 
 Is there any performance or security purpose behind untagging your network device management IP? Is it less safe to leave it tagged even though the management IP would still be accessible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have installed a cloud router switch, which is the first Mikrotik device/router I am configuring and on top of that, I am not a network engineer with my only experience coming from homelabbing. Basically, I had the smart idea of colocating some of my equipment in a datacenter which is what I am using the CRS for. My colo provider provided me with a /27 set of ips. In the quick config, I gave the router a IP address which works (I am able to ping and access it, and I am using wireguard). I have a hypervisor that I will be creating VMs in. The hypervisor allows me to enter a pool of IPs to use so it could automatically assign a static IP from that pool to a server (also I need to give the hypervisor an IP as well). I am basically stumped on how to assign (or rather make available) a pool of IPs to the hypervisor that is connected directly to the router. The router seems to have picked up the IP I defined just fine. I tried doing a DHCP server using the pool of static IPs on an older config and when installing ubuntu server on one of my servers, it seemed to have pulled an IP and get internet as it asked to update the installer but I since have cleared that config as I ran into issues, and that I don’t think I want to do DHCP but I want the server to be able to use the addresses for manual assignment. Any ideas on how to accomplish this? Would it be just a question of making sure the configuration on the device side is right?Also all of my LAN ports are on a bridge (aside from the WAN port).
 Any help would be appreciated, thanks!.

If I have a family, we're going to struggle. (Look at Canadian real estate prices, particularly in Vancouver. A partner making the same as me wouldn't even be enough combined income for a one-bedroom condo.)
 Big picture life plan: I'd like the option of getting a TN-1 visa and going to the States, but my lack of diploma/degree in a related field means I wouldn't meet the educational requirements—plus lack of education makes me less marketable to US employers. So I'm looking at getting a diploma or maybe even degree online (TRU most likely). It would need to be online/flexible as I need to keep my day job. I couldn't afford to exist on student loans alone in today's Canadian rental market.
 Question: should I just completely forget about learning anything from Udemy courses (some of which I really like the look of), or could that realistically fill gaps that a formal education wouldn't?

 Since John started as one of my father's first few employees (before we had computers), our headcount has grown, we are spread across a few facilities, user needs have changed, and there's more technology than ever. To keep things short, John has not kept up with the times and best practices; he has only recently upgraded his work machine to Windows 10, can barely join a VoIP-based meeting, and is unaware of most solutions that could help make his job easier.

 What's interesting to me is that for one of the workstations we have, OneDrive absolutely did not behave as expected. The end user's machine was encrypted, fine, we'll do a OneDrive reset to the previous day. Or roll back the versions on the important files. When I started doing that, I noticed something terrifying: every version was encrypted. The original version might have been three years old, I restore it, encryption. I check the restore option, just gonna reset the whole thing. Before I do, I start looking at the files in the restore. The encryption was present throughout, weeks before the event occurred. 
 Okay, maybe it's been on this PC for a while, patient zero, etc. So I go check our third party backups for 0365. Clean as a whistle. No sign of any encryption at all on the same files for the same date that the OneDrive reset is showing as bad. 
 Called in a few outside resources to look at it, and they flipped. Have some pending reach out to some resources to better understand, mostly just making this post since I know a lot of people use OneDrive, don't trust Microsoft's verbiage of only the latest version can be affected by ransomware, appears to be patently false as of now (which I feel we all kind of expected but still).

I am over in a rural area, with little exposure to new equipment, practices, and people/education. I sometimes am a sysadmin, sometimes a server admin, sometimes cloud admin, but everytime I am the guy getting calls for "support". 
 More recently I was wooed by a company to come and learn BAS controls and so off I went. Now I am doing admin work, desktop support work, controls design/engineering/install/support. Still have customers calling me for gates, door control and IP cameras.
 Maybe at one point I could keep up, but talk about master of none. 
 I guess I am here asking a few questions; I feel so burned out trying to keep up with the tech changes in each of these fields. What the hell do I do here?
 Part of me is wanting to give up all tech, but my fear of being irrelevant and not making money is everything. 
 I gave up being 100% independent to work for a company, and that company is mainly controls. Controls is okay, being a subcontractor of other subcontractors sort of sucks though, it's like we are just always pushed around, schedule wise, etc. 
 Anyway, there anything any of you could offer up? Let er rip. Roast me even.

Staff Network - 802.1x with Radius via username and password
 Managed Student Device Network (Chromebooks, Promethean boards, iPads, etc) - WPA2 PSK
 Public - Isolated network with guest sponsor required to logon.
 Windows 2016 NPS server.
  
What I'm trying to do is move the managed student device network off of any sort of PSK. I'm having a hilariously hard time trying to find solid documentation on how to do any sort of certificate based authentication for those devices.
 From what my pea sized brain understands so far, I need to have a CA server (which I have) to generate a certificate with, push the certificate out to our devices via our MDM, etc. I'm just unclear on how to connect all of that together. I want to ensure that only devices that have our cert on them are able to connect to the managed student device network.
 Thanks so much for your help. If I can expound upon anything to make it more clear please let me know!

Configuring a maximum suppression threshold of 50,000 and a suppress threshold of 6000 is what's currently advised. The prior recommendation (ripe-378) was to disable (or not enable) route dampening at all because it potentially cause more harm than good. 
 Is route dampening enabled in your organization. If so, what values have you settled on?

 The other employees (they are sysadmins too) really became jealous suddenly and so my boss said the first and best thing to do is to fire me.
 I don’t understand anything anymore and it wouldn’t be a problem but my wife is pregnant (9th month) and the baby can be on his way at any moment.
 So I have to look for a new job because we really need the money as fast as possible. 
 I don’t know what to do now :-( any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Reading tailscale's documentation about how they allow peer to peer connection through UDP hole punching, there is something I don't understand : tailscale uses wireguard, so the server to which we want to connect needs to listen on a certain port. Let's say the client wants to connect to the server, but the server is behind a NAT, with no port forwarding. Then, tailscale uses STUN servers, and with the ip + port information, can do UDP hole punching to let the client connect to the server behind the firewall. However, this peer to peer connection only works on this particular random port, and doesn't connect the client to the listening wireguard port ? One solution would be that they use iptables which redirects the higher ports to the wireguard ports, but I don't think that it's the case because it seems really impractical...
 How do they manage to do this ? Is there something I don't understand ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Quick question regarding IGMP queriers as I can't find a good answer online;
 My understanding is that all multicast traffic is forwarded to the querier, so let's say we have one switch (A) with a load of sources and receivers and another switch (B) which is the querier which has its own set of sources and receivers, these two switches are connected. Even if the receivers on switch A are only wanting to receive the sources on the same switch, all the sources are still gonna be sending a copy of their traffic to Switch B, the querier, correct?
 If that's the case, won't that mean the link between switch A and switch B is gonna be completely congested and dropping packets?
 Or do the sources on switch A just send reports to the querier on switch B so it's not forwarding the full multicast traffic to the querier unless there's a receiver on switch B that sends a join?
 ​
 Many thanks

 I think the hardware I should be looking at is from Peplink or Cradlepoint - but I'm looking for someone to walk me to the actual answer than doing this a la carte.
 I need to be able to push data uploads towards .5TB to 1TB inside 24 hour period (regularly) while mobile. 
 This situation is where getting 500GB there in under 12 hours is a significant advantage over Fedex. 
 I figure that an upload speed (of 300-500Mb/s would be ideal)- and I guess I will need a combination of different carriers to get (ideally) near maximum US coverage. 
 Knowing that LTE is often spotty (and towards 10Mb or less.) Maybe having someone drive to a (close) 5G connective spot would make sense.

 Considering that the people I’m working with are just acting as a shopping cart between me and the manufacturer I truly don’t know why they think I owe them something. Over the past 10 years I’ve gotten such truly bad advice from them I have no idea why they think I owe them anything or what value they think they bring to the table.
 I needed a firewall, I got a quote, said wow, that’s BS! Made two more phone calls and found that CDW wanted 30% more from me than others did. On their best day they don’t bring 30% more value to the table. I also don’t let companies bid against each other, I get the best price and I go for it, I have no need to beat someone down further; I want companies to make money I just don’t want to be raped.
 So a few months later they found out that I didn’t buy the firewall from them, and just like any scammer they get REALLY mad when their mark gets away. So they retaliate the best way they can which is not to renew my subscriptions on time; not an issue, the subscriptions have also been removed from their company now too.
 I know it’s not the company instead it’s the shitty employee but that company promotes that type of behaviour.
 I truly have no idea what actual benefit CDW and the likes being to the table. I get more benefit out of Amazon just not making me speak to someone to place a freaking order.

 Any thoughts or ideas on how to best document what he has done so that both Thomas and I could leave and a new guy could come in and pick up what we left?
 The things I have done is make spreadsheets of servers, databases, hostnames, domains, and their renewal times, but what I have struggled more with is things such as our finance process, and how he has designed the whole process from the ground up to be tied with old software. Some of this is really easy high level documentation (servers and databases) other parts are really detailed and minute and I'm not sure how to handle this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying to figure out how two data centers (mostly in different geographical areas) can be connected. These will have various machines which should be able to connect to each other at Layer 3. Let's say DC1 has subnet1 and DC2 has subnet2, machines from these subnets should be able to talk to each other. 
 After spending some time I got to know about MPLS, and a couple of more things like ACI, VPLS, etc., out of which VXLAN EVPN made sense and that's what I want to use. But reading more about it, I got confused further. I have read these:
  
https://yves-louis.com/DCI/?p=1588
 https://nuagenetworks.github.io/2017/09/17/MultiDC-Networking.html
  
Few articles say I need some connectivity at L3 to be able to do VXLAN EVPN. 
  
What are the options to implement this? 
 Do I need any special connectivity between two DCs? Or the communication can happen via public Internet?
 Is there any specific hardware I need to work as BGW or a machine with Open vSwitch will do? 
 If eBGP is required, then I also need to get ASN I guess? Will this be same for two DCs?
  
I'm new (noob to be honest) to DC networking so I might have wrong assumptions, also any pointers to articles, white papers, or any help is appreciated.

 Longer Version: I started a new role a while ago, it's an environment where the previous chap had left long before I could get anything like a handover, there's no documentation, 10+ Windows images (A mix of LTSB and LTSC), SCCM / Config Manager and a plethora of apps, tweaks, scripts and all kinds of stuff going on that I've spent a while working out alongside the core patching stuff. 
 On the image side I came in with limited experience and they were aware of this from the first interview and promised training, it never came and looks unlikely to do so.

 We have a developer that wrote a side utility to our main application.
 He schedules this utility as a scheduled job on servers to run various tasks as necessary.
 The problem is, this utility without fail, will run the servers out of heap memory, eventually requiring a reboot of the machine.
 I have explained to him why I think it's doing this. I may be wrong about it, not sure as he's refused to even try it.
 This kind of behaviour is par for the course with him. Very little common sense, and always creating problems then dumping them on other people for them to deal with.
 Originally these jobs were scheduled on a production server, and for obvious reasons, this developer does not have direct access to production servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Morning,
 I am trying to find a way to work within my given parameters (read: budget) with the technology I already have. I apologize if this is all over the place. Thank you in advance!
 I have:
 Three Synology RS820+ NAS with 17.5 TB each (12, 12, 4, 4 in SHR format, 1 drive fault tolerance) that are at separate locations.
 All locations have 100 Mbps connections.
 We have 1 host with 5 Hyper-V VMs at one site, 1 host with 3 Hyper-V VMs at another site.
 (Side note: When I first got here, they were doing bare metal full backups of servers and trying to transfer them off site. Far too large but that is still in place. Need a better solution)
 I started using Veeam Community Edition to replicate 4 of the 5 VMs from one host to the other, file server being the one not replicating.
 Also using Veeam to backup the file server twice a day to one of the NAS devices (320 GB). We would like to have that data replicated to the other two NAS devices. This is part of the issue, I can't seem to come up with a strategy that doesn't involve trying to transfer 2+ TB daily (bare metals) over a 100 Mbps connect (~1.8 days).
 The question: Do I just continue to replicate these VMs and keep the data separate? Trying to accommodate a quick recovery without transferring too much data. By the time 2 TB transfers over 100 Mbps, it's 2 days old when it gets there. Doing that AND the 320 GB just clogs the pipes.
 TL;DR; How do I get 8 Hyper-V machines and 320 GB of daily file backups from two sites backed up most efficiently without moving huge bare metal backups over 100 Mbps pipes to all three locations. Yes, I know my title is a senior. Small company, titles are titles.

It looks to be on the client side as it is only happening on one user's computer in Outlook 2016. The emails are showing up in OWA, which lead me to believe it was possible a rule to was set up incorrectly.
 After checking the rules on the user's computer, I didn't find anything out of the normal. Since the user doesn't own the mailbox, checking safe senders or blocked senders isn't an option.
 I've tried repairing Outlook as well as removing and re-adding the shared mailbox but haven't had any luck. For now the user can use OWA as a workaround, which isn't ideal but it is what it is at the moment.
 Any assistance would be welcome.

Server is now back online and cluster appears to be behaving correctly again, but the Validate Cluster is throwing errors (exact details i dont have to hand right now)
 When running all validation tests, it fails (red) on 'validate cluster network configuration' step, with the rebuilt node as the issue. Other tests are good & warning states (as expected - stuff like VM's are off/no auto start)
 run JUST 'validate cluster network configuration' test on it's own... it passes; green! clearly no config issue. go back to running a full test and it'll fail.
 thoughts?

Today I logged in to the account and was going to sign up for a license again to do some more experimenting. I noticed that under Settings > Partner Relationships it shows SYNNEX365 as a reseller. They had a few roles assigned, I don’t recall what they where I just deleted them immediately. When I started the account I bought the license through Microsoft directly, I never even knew what SYNNEX365 was until I saw it in this account and googled it. 
 Any idea how they would of showed up in my account as a reseller? Is this just some marketing agreement with Microsoft? Any idea how to get rid of them from my account? I deleted the tiles they had but can’t seem to get rid of them entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says I need to find a way to disable Windows Updates on a Windows 10 Pro PC and for some reason the PC of a customer still ran updates causing some chaos when it did.
 Online I only find how to pause them for 7 days or avoid them during business hours.
 We already asked some people an online and so far all I've got was the following
  
Stop and set service "Windows Update Medic Service" to disabled
 Stop and set service "Windows Update" to disabled
 Block Windows 11 Updates with 2 Registry Keys 
 Path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate
 Key 1: TargetReleaseVersion - Type: dword - Value: 00000001
 Key 2: TargetReleaseVersionInfo - Type: String - Value: 22H2
 
 Open the GPO Editor 
 Go to Computer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ Windows Updates
 Edit the Policy "Configure Automatic Updates"
 Set to "Enabled" and "2 - Notify for download and auto install"
 
  
The PC is used in an industrial setting and only needs an internet connection to let the technicians connect via Teamviewer QS if there are issues. Other than that it's running as a VM and the user is connected via RDP from a PC that is easy to replace if it breaks. This makes it easier for the customer to create backups of the VM when needed.
 To be honest I'm surprised the customer called during the afternoon and not during the morning as the VM rebooted during the weekend because of an Update and of course nobody checked / noticed until one of their industrial panels was blocking everything.
 Does anyone have any other idea on how to prevent windows updates? The customer refuses to use a WSUS and to be honest I am not very experienced with them either.
 Update:
 Each time someone clicks on the button Check for Updates, it's re-enabling the Windows Update Service. Is this supposed to happen? Shouldn't it stay disabled?

 I am looking for a solution to use for RDP for long distances.
 The distance is US-EMEA btw, so the latency is around 200-250ms.
 We have tested VPN with Microsofts RDP, which is fine but everything on the browser lags too much.
 And we were thinking of maybe something like guacamole or something similar maybe better?
 The absolute must haves are to be able to authenticate with Azure AD (Entra ID) .
 We did not went to the option of Citrix or Horizon because they require a substantial amount of setup and our use case is to server a couple of hundred users for specific apps.
 Any suggestions are welcome

 So I am working on moving over a Cisco 5500 series Lan Controller for a client to a 9105axi EWC. The wireless worked when they were using the 5500 but after the tier 3 tech built out the EWC it no longer works. It detects the APs but when you tag the traffic there is no longer any connectivity and a Wireshark capture shows that it cannot see the gateway.
 All routing is done through a layer 3 switch with SVI's. The trunks are allowing all vlans and the AP's switchports are in access mode due to using split mac architecture. I'm not sure if its how the WLANs are setup but I feel like it should just be working because all that changed was the type of WLC.
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

physically destroy the drives (probably by a 3rd party with certificate since we do not have a lot of spare time to bother destroying it ourselves) 2.wipe them ourselves and donate/sell to our staff (but i am afraid of the work and "support" people might expect on the old machines).
 Only wipe them according to NIST SP 800-88 assurance certificate and get a certificate. This will be performed by an institution that will later donate the hardware to kids and schools.
  
I feel like going for option 1, since it gives me the least headache personally. However, i feel a little wastefull, there are probably a lot of people that will make comments ("i would have bought that"/"not good for the environment") when they discover everything was disposed of.. 
 We are not nessecarily a top secret data company, but of course there is some intellectual property and personal data on those drives.
 What do you personally do for your company, is wiping enough? Do you ever get comments about getting them destroyed, how do you deal with it.

 The problem that I am encountering is that both the side have the same private network IP range (that need to communicate). The first thought I had was if I could add physical interfaces to the VPN router and the server ( creating a new network) however that is not possible as i'm using Digital Ocean and it currently does not support having multiple interfaces.
 ​
 eg : https://ibb.co/w6Wn2TP
 Is there way I can do a virtual interface and then NAT ? Any advice!

 I've got an issue where anytime a user tries to connect to shared drive we get the system cannot connect to a domain controller to service the authentication... etc etc... error
 If I log in as a different account on there then I am able to connect to the drive
 This issue is localised to just a few users
 These machines are hybrid joined so already just in a workgroup, most articles I've found online suggested putting into workgroup, rebooting then rejoining to domain but our machines aren't joined to a domain.
 Already tried flushing dns, stop starting etc etc.
 Any ideas?

 I want to venture into the field of networks/infrastructure, but I'm not quite sure about the roles or the knowledge I need to land a job. I have two years of experience as a frontend developer, and I did a little bit in backend and process automations. Lately, I've become interested in transitioning to networking or something related to infrastructure. I have several questions that I'd like to clarify:
 1) I understand that having the Cisco CCNA certification is a good idea for working in networks. Can you recommend any books or materials I can use for support? What topics do you consider the most important ones for me to know?
 2) I've seen a couple of job offers that require at least Ssr or Senior-level experience. Is there a path to enter as a trainee or at a more entry-level position?
 3) Is there a lot of programming involved in these types of jobs, or is it primarily about diagnosing, installing, and resolving communication problems?
 4) If you have any experience in this area, I'd appreciate it if you could share a bit about your experience and the position you hold.
 5) At the same time, I'd like to know if you're aware of other similar positions. For my part, I know the following (Networking Administrator, Sysadmin, Networking Technician, DevOps).
 6) When a job offer mentions "knowledge of Linux," what specific aspects of Linux are they referring to?
 7) What other skills do you find important to mention?

 I'm trying to populate my Google Workspace directory with new badge numbers for both external entry (primary number in papercut) and internal doors (secondary number in papercut). I have the sync working as expected, but the cards aren't scanning in correctly when done at the MFP. I tried the hex2dec option, but while that looked better, it isn't matching the numbers.
 ​
 True, vanilla RFID scans:
 Internal: 2446487570 External: 0000982075
 Papercut Logged Numbers (dual frequency cards, so I'm not super sure which is which)
 1270D291 and 20000EFC3B
 Papercut logged numbers after hex2dec:
 137439935547 and 309383825
 ​
 I don't see a way to reprogram at the MFP, but I have tried to switch the "ID Card Read Type" setting to all of the options, which still results in having the same reads. I admit that I have no idea what the other read settings do, and I wasn't able to find them in any manuals.
 Here is a link to a screenshot of that config page.
 ​
 If anyone has any suggestions on how to go about figuring ot how these are encoded and/or how to get papercut to see the "true" scan that has been entered into Google, that would be excellent.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I work in a small environment, about 200 users, and we need to improve our security. Part of the job is to deploy LAPS to every endpoint. I read that LAPS stores the local passwords to Active Directory, what does it mean? What if AD fails for whatever reason and we need to access local admin accounts?
 Do you have any experience and/or suggestions for that?
 Thank you in advance.

 We recently implemented stricter CA policies and wondering if this was the cause of the impact but it’s still a wild guess
 User got a bit locker recovery screen, following that the device booted up and was blocked for being a non compliant device. I exempted the user and they was able to sign into office apps but now it’s registered a new device as Azure AD Azure Registered, its left the existing Hybrid Azure machine there but that’s not what’s being seen upon login.
 Anyone have any ideas or seen something similar? How can we get his device back to the correct state of being a Hybrid machine / compliant device.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an SCCM admin and decided to pass arguments to msi files by using transforms. Unfortunately the Adobe Acrobat installer (setup.exe, which calls a msi file internally) always uses a locally cached MST file. I can overcome this by deleting the corresponding key under "HKLM\Software\Classes\Installer\Products\{GUID}" but of course this is not a suitable solution.
 I assume I read the whole TRANSFORMS documentation of MS but I can't find a way to tell the installer not to use a cached mst but the one in the installer directory instead.
 Changing the product code *could* be a solution, but I fear breaking other functionalities then. 
 Embedding the mst in the msi is also a possibility, but this would by my last resort.
 Any chance one of you have also faced this issue before and found a solution?

 Has anyone switched from Okta to Azure AD recently, or vice-versa? Why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem after changing the speed of Host ESXi 6.5.X interface MGT
 Hi there, how are you doing, I hope it's going well.
 We have a situation where a change was made forcing the speed of the MGT interface, the management vnic, from the Web-Gui, html vware client, standalone esxi, we tried to force from 100MB to 1Gb to be in tune with the switch, but it did not work and lost access to the Host, at least it is a LAB host, non-productive environments. Despite forcing on the switch the speed from the switch, of the interface, that connects to the ESXI, the ESXI does not lift the network.
 Now the option we are considering is directly to the DC, with a laptop to connect from Ethernet to Ethernet, the ESXi card after the change was left in 1GB, and well most of the laptops today are 1GB.
 1.- So we are thinking of doing that, a direct connection and make the adjustment via the HTML interface.
 2.- Another one is to connect a keyboard and a screen and make the change from the yellow interface directly to the Esxi Host in DCUI, can you change from there?
 This server, this one from Lab, development. When it was installed, the interface, via esxi html web interface, does not give auto negotiation as an option, so I think this should only be configured via Esxi-shell, and set the interface to auto. Because from the web, it was only 10/100 and 1000, but not auto, From 100, I passed it to 1000 and then everything went to hell hehehe. The switch, its interface is in auto and the strange thing is that it only negotiated the connection at 100MBits, I feel that the network card of the server supports 1GB. That's why we changed it in the ESXi html to 1Gb and everything fell apart. 
 Thanks for the good vibes, the time and the collaboration.
 What other options, suggestions, advice, comments could you tell me.
 Thanks
 I remain attentive

I also have had a pair of aftershockz that were really cool because I could still hear my bridge call over server fans. I'm shopping for a new pair because one of my galaxy buds fell out of my ear into the "magic triangle", so propbably not another pair of those. They fell out all the time and needed constant readjusting. 
 I'm thinking of getting the newer aftershockz that are an "earbud with an over the ear hook". Maybe the ones with a boom mic. But I figure I'd ask some others in the field what they prefer. Maybe try something new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a network that is 100% Unifi gear. 10 switches, 80 APs, UNVR with about 30 cameras, and a USG-PRO-4. We want to replace the USG with a Check Point firewall. The problem is we have attempted this twice, and both times the network went haywire. We set us DHCP on windows servers, and set the relays on the VLAN interfaces on the Check Point, but clients could not get IPs. Clients with static IPs couldn’t really communicate on the network. Lots of dropped packets. Any connection we had would cut out after a couple minutes.
 We tried rebooting every switch and AP, forgetting the USG from the Unifi controller, set the Unifi networks to being VLANs on and using a third party router, and even split all the VLANs up as access ports connected between the switch and firewall. Also tried only having one switch powered on and connected to the firewall, but still had issues.
 I have worked with check point a lot, and have always had success connecting them to Aruba, Cisco, and Juniper switches. We want to replace the switches with next years budget, but for now this is what we have to work with. They only two things I can think of to try next are putting in a third party switch between the Check Point and Unifi switch, or wiping out the Unifi configurations and factory resetting everything thinking there might be a bad config somewhere.

Bouncing from project to project on a day to day basis and trying to keep your head straight has been hard recently but yesterday was actually very peaceful. 
 Yesterday, a shipment of RAM and SSDs came across my desk and I was tasked with installing the RAM and SSDs on a bunch of laptops. It was kind of peaceful in comeparison to the normal running around and trying to finish tasks in different projects all at once. Each laptop booted successfully, all the RAM was registered, and Windows didn't throw a fit when updating it. It was honestly refreshing to get some wins like this. 
 Mind you, I like the noisy and fast environment but sometimes working on something so simple like a laptop component upgrade is nice. Something where little can go wrong. 
 What are some of the tasks or jobs you like doing because they're simple and peaceful in comparison to the normal work?

I know AWS offers many services across databases, networking, storage, and more. Is there a specific service I should be focusing on? Do I need to know all services? For ex, database management services? Its a non-network related function, wouldn't this service be manged by DB admin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So.. recently have been tasked with designing a system setup for CCTV monitoring and other physical security applications.
 The kicker here is that our business that has approx 200+ locations have 7 or 8 different CCTV systems implemented (NUUO, Hik Vision, Dahua, UNV, Uniview and a couple of others).
 They (management) would like these all centralised on one physical machine they can access in person and stream live footage and playback/recordings as needed. 
 These old systems eat a chunk of RAM as standalones, let alone all running simultaneously.
 My rough plan is a dedicated link running into something like a rack mounted server and then having the permitted users authorised to RDP from a dedicated NUC or tiny PC to the server itself running the CCTV systems and other software. We do run a pretty decent security setup, Azure AD, 2FA and the rest of the nine yards.
 Am I way off base here? Any methods you would recommend to estimate the CPU and RAM requirements?

 Client has one account, lets call it ["shared.calendars@durp.com](mailto:"shared.calendars@durp.com)". This account holds all the org-wide shared calendars for all the depts, (Finance, IT, HR, etc...), and permissions are managed by the IT dept. So if accounting gets a new person, IT gets a ticket to add them to all the needed calendars.
 Not sure what drove them to configure things this way, but I can see both positive and negatives, with the biggest negative being that their small 3 person dept now sits squarely in charge of...calendars?
 I need some other folks perspective on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First question
 I understand that route based VPNs don't need them because of a routing table entry if destination = X use tunnel interface Y to send out pakets to destination, so there is a predefined route from source to destination.
 But why does policy based VPN need Proxy ID's and how are they exactly used? Would be nice if someone could explain it in a paket flow kind of way.
 ​
 Side question
 I've seen on some websites that you can configure Proxy ID's for route based VPN. What's the reason for that? Is it because of compability reasons like if the firewall or router on the other side can only use policy based VPN? This suggest that one side can use route based VPN and the other one policy based VPN and create a functioning tunnel.

 We have a windows terminal server thats causing no ends of issues over the last couple of weeks. The last 3 weekends have led us to rebooting it on a Saturday because it seems to be getting itself in a mess. Nothing I can see in the event viewer that stands out and looking after and maintaining servers has only started to become a main role for me. Is there anything that can be run like sfc /scannow on a windows server and is it worth investing the time to find the issue and fix the server over building a new VM and then making it live. Maybe investigating the issues at a later date.
 Is there any software that can really help us understand when servers are suffering issues and have an understanding of what is happening. I find event viewer to be exceptionally difficult to siphon through to find actual issues.
 I’ve enabled more logging in the last few weeks but this doesn’t seem to be helping me find the issue.
 We are a fairly large company with the ability to spin up VMs fairly quickly, and the TSV would have our main application on it then office on top for users to use. The TSV application links back to the application server where all the SQL is done.
 Edit 1: We have a farm and broker setup ready but supposedly there are issues with roaming profiles on these servers. I’ve had no interaction with this. 
 Also the server is the oldest of 4 we use and is given mainly to our manufacturing computers to access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently assessing my companies Git hosting method and what would be best for us. Right now we primarily use a local Git Tea server w/ Jenkins, but it currently has no dedicated resource to maintain it, and lacks a lot of features. We wouldn't be able to improve on this easily in the foreseeable future.
 I'd like to propose moving to GitHub Enterprise cloud with managed users, as it would be great for our IT ops team and would make a lot of our security easier (SAML, 2FA and can even choose data residency locale). I can probably sell it on cost, features etc. However, one of our teams writes SW for use on hardware in datacentres, and would push back against a cloud-hosted solution most likely due to issues with security compliance: essentially "we don't want our code on someone else's server". I understand this concern, but I find it poorly justified with our current solution.
 What I am looking for are potential EU & US policies, laws, standards etc. that I should be aware of that may apply to our scenario when it comes how we host our code. Would GitHub Enterprise cloud be more or less compliant? And how could I address potential concerns our SW team may have?

Then there are the the Ethernet cables, I have a box of them that I should just purge as well. I have a drawer full of Ethernet cables brand new so I don't know why I hold onto this box of old cables.... Our office got new carpets and so everyone had to clean up their space.

I’m fine using it as tear off, but I can’t figure out how to get the labels to be aligned so as to tear off at the cutter position instead of the typical tear off position (as if there was not a cutter attached). 
 Is there a setting to allow the printer to still be usable by tearing off without replacing the cutter? 
 If I can get the label to advance enough to tear at the perforations between the labels, how do I get it to then backfeed before printing so the label can be printed correctly using the full label?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dealing with a really odd issue I'm hoping someone has experience with...
 ​
 Currently running a Windows 2019 server as a VM within ESXI.
 ESXI is connected via 2 ethernet cables to a synology box which is acting as an iSCSI host.
 one ethernet cable goes directly from the ESXI server to the synology box (2.5gig 10.0.0.0/24 VLAN 1)
 second ethernet cables goes from the ESXI server to a switch (connected to the rest of my network) and the synology box is also connected directly to the same switch (1gig 192.168.0.0/24 VLAN 0)
 I have SMB3 Multichannel setup on the synology box which the Windows server uses for file storage (aswell as using the synology box for iSCSI).
 ​
 The multichannel generally works well - when I pull a file from the synology box I can see both the 1gig and 2.5gig are fully utilised.
 ​
 However once every (exactly) 10 minutes the multichannel fails, then a few seconds later comes back.
 ​
 I've determined it's happening due to this:
 https://imgur.com/SZROEJj
 ​
 Once every 10 minutes the windows server attempts to add the 192.168.0.253 -> 10.0.0.1 multipath.
 When it does this is disables the two paths:
 192.168.0.253 -> 192.168.0.251
 10.0.0.3 -> 10.0.0.1
 which drastically drops the speed for a couple seconds, then the 192.168.0.253 -> 10.0.0.1 channel fails, and then it resumes the good channels and everything goes back to normal.
 ​
 You can see the errors happening every 10 minutes exactly in event viewer:
 https://imgur.com/a/bZvKLfe
 ​
 The problem is I never set these channels, they are dynamically created.
 The 10.0.0.0/24 network is literally 1 cable going straight from the ESXI server into the back of the synology box on a seperate dedicated VLAN.
 ​
 I'm not sure how windows could "automatically detect" a route from 192.168.0.253 -> 10.0.0.1 when one of the cables is completely isolated?
 ​
 Not sure if this is an issue with the virtual switch in ESXI or something?
 ​
 Thanks for the help.

 I am not that good in networking, hence why I am asking here. 
 from where I come from almost every restaurant/bar have free wifi with captive portal, and I figured they (the company) were just getting the router and give it to the restaurant be done with it, 
 anyway I was thinking if I want to do something similar how would I implement such a thing but without the need of giving away router, 
 after my research and lots of googling, I understand in theory that I will somehow get the IP address of anyone who enters consider it untagged show captive portal (using redirect whether it is DNS or HTTP) then tag the ip once user click continue or whatever, then tag it and they enjoy the session. 
 so my question is not sure how to do the part of the somehow, I understand that I need to have DHCP server on cloud. and instead of giving away router I configure the already installed router to point to my DHCP server. 
 also was wondering how would I do such a thing on a big scale, say 100 restaurants/bars.

I'm a sys admin at a manufacturing company, and as is often the case, wears many hats, including the in house programmer. I built an Employee Management application for the company that proved to be well adopted and successful. I kept getting comments that I should sell it and that other companies can benefit from that etc. I discussed this with the CEO, and he mentioned that he would have no problem signing whatever document is required to allow me to have full ownership of the app considering it was built mostly on company time. I never really considered this before, nor have any experience with monetization, but it would be nice to start my own thing and have something part time for some extra cash.
 Does any of you have any experience in where to start, where to go from here? I know I have to do the following, just not sure of the order: create a registered company, copyright the software, look into a business model (client hosted, cloud hosted, subscription based vs one time fee, etc.), create a front facing website for the company, advertise the software (how?, where?), figure out support, training... geez writing all this down is overwhelming, is this something worth pursuing?

 Upfront - I am a basic bitch when it comes to anything and everything sysadmin when it comes to things, so please grant me some grace as I ask you internet gods for some help.
 ​
 Current Setup (much of which I inherited)... I think I have them all listed.
 Domain: Hosted on Network Solutions
 Name Server: Wix
 Mail: Google
 ​
 On Monday, one of my employees noticed that he was able to send email but not receive it. We tried several tests, including me sending him emails from our domain as well as external emails to his email, no dice. Fast forward the story - turned out to be a company-wide issue where we were all able to send out from our email but not receive anything. Fast fast forward, it looks like our domain expired over the weekend. I immediately panicked and renewed the domain, and everything was restored within 24 hours.
 ​
 Now here is the rub... the emails that we sent to test, never came through. Is there any back-end settings or anything I can do to force emails that were sent last Friday to this past Monday to be delivered to its rightful place? Is there a holding area? I have no idea where to begin and would love some advice. I am worried we may have lost some emails from clients that came in during the "down" time and want to see what can be done.

 Thanks All!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an in-house mini-SCADA application running on a Windows Server 2016 Standard OS. It has a number of links to peripheral devices (controllers, Ethernet-to-serial gateways). Those links are primarily Modbus TCP or Modbus RTU-over-TCP.
 We have seen sporadic TCP connection dropouts every couple of weeks, i.e. connections to all external devices will be dropped and SCADA application will automatically reconnect. However, every time a number of alarms are raised in our SCADA application and logged in relevant log files.
 Initially I thought there is no pattern behind it, but I reviewed logs from the past couple of months and I can definitely see a patter, looks like the problem occurs every ~1193 hours...
 Extract from my SCADA logs:
 2022/11/18 11:12:13 - Windows boot time
 (might have been one occurrence in February, but SCADA logs have been overwritten so cannot check)
 2023/04/16 15:18:12 - connections in SCADA dropped, 2387.09h since boot, so roughly 2 x 1193h
 2023/06/05 08:22:59 - connections in SCADA dropped, 1193h since last occurrence
 2023/07/25 01:27:47 - connections in SCADA dropped, 1193h since last occurrence 
 I checked Windows Event log around that time but I could not find anything of interest in the main Application/System/Administrative logs.
 The only reference to 1193h that I could find on the internet is related to ancient Windows OS (https://ftp.zx.net.nz/pub/archive/ftp.microsoft.com/MISC/KB/en-us/136/935.HTM), so cannot imagine this still applies to Server 2016.
 So the questions is: has anyone ever come across a similar problem, i.e. a recurring network-related problem in Windows Server that occurs roughly every ~1193 hours?
 I may be just going insane, but if there is a pattern, there must be a cause!

These screens are connected to an HP mini PC because employees need to login to the webui that displays the information with their badge. This is done with h a USB badge scanner that is connected to the PC. The page that we are displaying needs to be refreshed so a set interval. We keep getting told from the app vendor that “the refresh will be included in the next release”. Four releases later we are spending too much time monthly remoting into these PCs and starting a Edge extension to refresh the page. Looking at VuePilot to better manage these displays. Currently have 30ish displays, increasing monthly. What’s your thoughts? Different ideas?

 Curious how zfs will handle the filesystems and quotas, etc.
 Please no rants on me mixing two techs or anything of the sorts, not looking to argue over opinions. I'm asking a simple question if anyone has done it, and how zfs and snapshots, and filesystems react to this.
 Short of doing it, and destroying the secondary pool to see what it does, which I might still do, I have no way of seeing how it reacts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I recently purchased a BX1200MI UPS from APC https://www.apc.com/shop/nl/en/products/APC-Back-UPS-1200VA-Tower-230V-6x-IEC-C13-outlets-AVR/P-BX1200MI
 However, when opening the box, to power the BX1200MI, I was expecting to receive a standard kettle lead with a 13A 3 Pin UK Plug like you would normally get for a desktop computer. However, instead I appear to have received an IEC C14 to C13 Power Lead https://imgur.com/TiFv6tB
 In the manual it states:
  
Please use incidental power cord in the package. 
  
However, I don't have a way of being able to get power from the wall using the C14 connector. So can I replace the cable with a standard kettle lead that has a 13A 3 Pin UK Plug or would that be a problem?
 Thanks for taking the time to read this

 I did an attempt before by changing DNS infos to signal ownership for my current hosting client but the email stopped working and i had to set default mode and undo the migration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a lawyer and genuinely make an effort to fix my own problems and only ask serious questions when needing help. I fully understand that endless questions from someone who can barely switch a monitor on without assistance and should know better by now are infuriating, but at least half of the people who work in my firm are technically competent; yet IT seem to hate us all (not openly, but you can sense the contempt). 
 I’ve also caused bad blood with IT at work by pointing out security issues as well as problems with home built systems running slowly or glitchy. These problems are then fixed and clearly life is better for everyone, but IT clearly hate me for having raised them, and often won’t do anything until senior management have been roped in.
 There seems to be a holier than thou attitude and a feeling of ‘we’re really what makes this place run and you’re all idiots’ but at the end of the day, my emails, Word docs and MS teams calls are what pay their wages and what keeps the firm afloat. I also suspect that if computers were outlawed overnight, us lawyers would work out how to return to books, paper and typewriters very quickly.
 It seems to be purely an IT thing - I’ve never experienced this sort of attitude (to the same extent) from people who work in admin, accounts or any other function that is ancillary to the main business. My clients ask me tedious, repetitive questions, are occasionally rude and are often asking me to do hard, boring, often unnecessary (if they’d taken my earlier advice) mind numbing stuff I don’t really want to do, but I’m polite and obliging and never look down on any of them.
 FWIW, I’ve noticed this nearly everywhere I work and not just my current workplace. Although there is a very sizeable minority who aren’t, the majority of IT people seem to be like this including the friends I have outside of work who work in IT.

 We’re looking at a better setup with either 40 sites or multiple sites per location for different departments. 
 What is the best way to handle this? Ideally something that makes it easy to give access to new employees but would that require a group for each department in each location?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://pynet.twb-tech.com/free-python-course.html
 For those of you who are interested.
 Great course.
 Not affiliated in any way, direct all questions to the site.
 
 FAQ from same page.
 ​
 What is the format of the course?
 This course is a ten week email-course. Each week you will receive a lesson that contains a set of videos, some additional content, and some exercises. I will post solutions to the exercises online. The course is largely self-paced except for the weekly email cadence.
 ​
 Is there a lab environment?
 No, since this is a free course, there is no lab environment. For all of the lessons you should be able to accomplish the lessons without having any access to network devices.
 ​
 What are the prerequisites for the course?
 This course is intended for network engineers that have some basic familiarity with programming (for example, Perl, shell scripting, other language) and who would like to learn Python. The course covers Python fundamentals, but using examples and exercises that are more relevant to network engineers.
 ​
 Why Python?
 Python facilitates writing clean, readable code and is natively present on Linux and MacOS. Python has gained widespread support in the networking community both from engineers and from vendors. Python has a large, active community and, consequently, numerous resources are available to you (libraries, documentation, books, tutorials, etc.).
 ​
 What if I am unsatisfied with the course after I sign-up?
 The course is free so unsubscribe from the email-list if you aren't happy with the lessons or our other content.

 Is there a hidden web site somewhere (I've tried searching the usual routes), or a helpful Network Guru with Edge-Core experience somewhere (maybe here!), who can provide some insight into this Switch and help us get it working? The Edge-Core Web Site doesn't have anything other than the Datasheet and User Manual.

Just rejects my creds no matter what account I use.That brought me to the Security log where I have thousands of Event ID 5061 Audit Failures. They happen by the second. There are no active users. It's some process that is generating these events. The Security ID is always Network Service and the Account is always the SFB computer name. Computername$. Return code is always 0x80090016. I don't know if the Control Panel issue and this is related. I am lost and Googling just leads me in circles. I need a starting point to work from. I don't know if it's certificate related or what. Any advice would be appreciated. Just as an FYI, if I go into IIS and select the cscp directory, then select Browse 443, Control Panel opens up and passes my creds just fine. I also notice that if I try to login as a Skype user using a test workstation, Skype prompts for credentials which it shouldn't do, and won't accept the test users password. Clearly some kind of authentication issue. All certs for the 6 servers in this test environment, two DC's, two Exchange, and two SFB, have been issued by a local CA installed on the DC. I will say a few weeks ago I updated the CA to issue SHA256 certs. Other servers are not having an issue. DC's and Exchange running 2016. SFB 2015 running 2012 R2.

 Within this org though I have multiple subgroups all of which need scans done by this SC.
 User A and B belong in group X
 User C and D belong in group Y.
 Now before I had 3 Orgs:
 Main org that scanned everything and reported up
 Org X which allows users A and B to run their own scans
 Org Y which allowed user C and D to do the same.
 Users A and B should not be able to see or scan the assets of Org Y, or read the results. They should be isolated. And no one other then myself has permission to login and view the scan results of Main Org.
 However i'm being told that the higher ups now see scans coming in as "Main Org, Org Y and Org X" and can't map Y or X to anything and are getting confused.
 So it's working now as I would want it to, but because higher ups have a convoluted way of pulling the scans up to them (Don't get me started) they are telling me I can't have it setup this way
 Is there any way to possible setup assets so only certain users can see them or scan them? The roles allow a binary "Yes/No" to creating scans but I can't see anywhere that you can set up permissions on the assets themselves or within the roles

 I'm well aware of the reasons for fax's prevalence in the industry, and personally I would just continue eating the monthly cost of cloud faxing because it is secure, just works, and we don't have to twist our clients or employees arms to get them to change their workflow.

I am also close to getting a job offer doing systems administration for a very large company for a manager I don't know. Assuming pay and benefits are similar. Which would you choose?
 background, I have 16+ years in network/systems engineering. But I feel like I am hitting the pay cap for my skillset. Moving to the InfoSec position would be a lateral move for me, but allow me to develop a more specialized skill set. This will allow for even higher paying jobs in the future. I know pay isn't everything, but I figure if I spend a year or so trying out InfoSec, and I hate it, then I can get another job as a sysadmin. I also believe that it would be difficult for me to find an InfoSec position later that pays this well without direct experience.
 I am leaning towards taking the InfoSec position. What would you do? Is there something glaringly obvious that I missing as to why I shouldn't?

However I created a topology topology to practice ways of avoiding letting the edge router become a transit AS. One of the ways is to use the no-export community value. I was wondering is there any reason to use next-hop-self in this scenario? 
 Also, is there any reason to use send-community on the iBGP neighbor statements since no external routes should traverse them anyway? Thanks

 However... It wont let me select the correct account, it says it doesn't exist. 
 But can see other services running using the exact same account!
 Even if I do a 'Browse' it's not there (all objects/locations are ticked).
 I can even run a powershell command to list all service accounts and see the NTService\MSSQL$<name> account I need. I can also go to permissions on any folder and grant that account permissions.
 It's simply just not visible to add as a 'Log On' account for the server.

 Anybody here can give suggest about this? If i'm not alone, we can plan upgrade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have seen scenarios before where individuals have acquired an ASN and IP that they use for personal consumption. The though recently came back into my head when I recently saw a reddit comment regarding an individual who owned an IPv4 /24 and used a VPN to a VPS that supported BGP to advertise the block without needed an expensive DIA connection.
 I have seen several Local Internet Registry's (LIR) in the RIPE region that seem to offer ASN's with IPv6 PA addresses for fairly cheap but they seem to attach there BGP or VPS services for anybody outside of the RIPE region. I'm in the US so this unfortunately raises the costs and complicates the billing. I would love to have an IPv4 block but I would be happy with an IPv6 block and an ASN to experiment with. My plan would be to essentially tunnel all traffic from my LAN to an opensense or pfsense VPS and then peer to the VPS provider. Maybe complicate thing with VPS in different sites and using it to host public faced services.
 So now that my long winded explanation is out of the way, has anybody done something similar to this? How did you acquire your ASN and IP block(s) and what reputable services are out there to register with? From what I can tell ARIN is not too friendly with this idea and RIPE seems to be the easier region to acquire resources from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sooooo, I got a customer who’s managing about 200 servers with WSUS. For years they had one person who’s only purpose it was to update all those servers one by one. Some water down the river, I took this over and wanted to implement 2 new GPO’s. One which is automatically downloading but not installing Server updates, the other one which is downloading and installing updated on Sunday at around 2am. So basically it doesn’t sound like a big deal. Now it comes… All serves starting from server 2012R2 till 2022 are completely ignoring the GPO. I have no clue why. Set up the “configure auto updates” policy. Once this didn’t work, I tried my luck with “scheduled maintenance” and some kinda hacky things that I found on the internet. Still, no luck… Servers are rebooting at any day of the week at any time of the day. Figured that maybe another policy is conflicting with mine, but no. Created a test server and put it top level of the domain. Not a single policy other than the default domain policy (which is empty) and my WSUS policy is applied to the server. The behavior is still the same. Once updates get detected, they get installed about an hour later and schedule a reboot for another hour later…
 Guess I’ll turn off the WSUS synchronization or at the the availability for all servers till next Sunday night or till I found a solution…

 As I understand it, I can only activate upto two VM's if I use hyper-V, not ESXi. So what is the deal with both MAK and KMS keys working from one purchase of ws2022 license?

Thing is we don't have a telco group anymore so we'll probably end up hiring contractors to get to the bottom of this. My question is, would it be easier and cheaper to switch out the existing POTs connection with something else (voip, cellular) OR just get these lines going again? Needless to say all this would also have to meet safety standards.

Currently, we just add the devices' MAC into Active Directory and the NPS policy is a accept/deny then assign VLAN when accepted. Is it possible to have a catch all VLAN with NPS? For example, if the devices' MAC has an account in AD assign that device to the respective VLAN, but if a device joins and isn't in AD, then assign it to a catch all/isolated VLAN? This is more for as were provisioning devices since it's easier to find the right MAC from our DHCP server than the different settings on the device. I've tried a handful of different things and have had no luck. We have Unifi AP's and Switches and NPS running on Windows 2019.

 1) When i configure router 1 with :
  
ip nat inside source static 172.168.0.1 12.12.12.2
  
Why does router 1 loses all ability to ping other routers and hosts outside of his own LAN ? Is it because it will forward the ping reply to 172.168.0.1, hence not receiving it technically, so it can send packets just fine but won't be answered to ?
 2) Why can host 192.168.1.1 (the host on the top left) connect to the website hosted on 172.168.0.1 ?
 I have configured BOX INTERNET with :
  
ip nat inside source list NAT_VLAN1 interface f1/0 overload (having configured the NAT_VLAN1 access-list beforehand)
  
From what i understand, it means that the HTTP request will replace the IP of the sender by BOX INTERNET's f1/0's ip address (10.10.10.1). I haven't done any port forwarding in the other direction though, so how can 172.168.0.1 send an HTTP response to 192.168.1.1, when from what i gather the response should be addressed to 10.10.10.1 ?
 I would greatly appreciate some explanations !

 I am maintaining an NPS Server and I'm a little confused and just wondered if someone could offer some clarity and point me to the right direction.
 I have an NPS Server and we have calendared that the cert is expiring.
 On the server itself, in NPS Management, I go into each of my network policies, constraints and PEAP and look at the certificate. It says it expires in 2024.
 I go into certificate store, local machine, personal and there is a certificate named the same expiring in 5 days time.
 ​
 I guess this might be obvious to some but I don't understand what is different here and how it's different. I also don't know if I need to do anything or not, since I'm seeing what I think is the same cert - twice - I don't want to change anything that breaks my clients...

My system admins don't seem to care enough just to push out a command telling all the computers to 'report in' that info, so I'm trying to build a way to automate it on the end user's computers that I'm building fixing myself.

 One server is our adds server, the other is our file share server.
 I have installed Veeam backup and replication on our ws2022 file server.
 Would the Veeam backup server be better living on the file server, or the adds server?
 Anyhow, Veeam needs to connect to our vCenter which is only connected to our OOB network. I do not want to expose our file server to our OOB network. 
 How do I do this right? I only have two WS2022 licenses, an esxi8 host server with vCenter that resides on an OOB network that can't see the internet.
 Can I put vCenter on our "backlan" that's just meant for servers and no users, so that Veeam can talk to it there?

What would be the best way for me to create a step by step tutorial with screenshots and everything? I've managed to do it for ManageEngine and Intune, but have no access to sccm deployment.
 What would be the best approach to get this thing done?

 A software that we use, uses the net use command to change passwords and unlock windows ad accounts with a stored account. 
 ​
 Now I wanted to use this function with a least privilege approach, and use a normal domain user with delgated rights to change passwords and read and write lockout times. Unfortunately as far as i can see, you need an elevated commandline to use the net user active:yes command. So i can't unlock the account, but the password change works without a problem. Is there anyway to get around that, without making the Password change account an Administrator?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

 we want to automate the process of enrolling user certifcates. Im testing with a small group right now and superseded the old certifcate template, with a new one where autorenroll is enabled.
 The process itself works fine, all users got the new certificate. But after like 1-2 days some users already got the message again to update the certificate which i really dont understand. Its valid for 7 days, and renewal period is 3 days. So from my understanding popups for autoenroll should only start after 4 days.
 Im really going crazy with that, i checked all logs and the template but i have no idea why these popups are coming up after like 1-2 days. Does anyone maybye has an idea why this does not work out? The productive certificate will be valid for 365 days, but i really dont want to roll that out, as long as i dont understand the renewal period.

 ​
 I use Citrix for my work connection with remote desktop. On my Windows laptop everything works fine, but on my MacBook Citrix always loses the connection when either the screensaver starts or when I close the laptop. I already deactivated energy saving and stuff. As soon as I use the touchpad and the screen goes from black to "normal" (or when I open the laptop again) it says this:
 "Citrix Workspace tries to reconnect for 5 minutes ...."
 ​
 Its strange that it doesnt seem to be a problem with the Mac bc on Windows I dont have this problem and also, why would Citrix disconnect when the laptop is closed but in the same time tries to reconnect? But like I said, the Apple board says it has nothing to do with my MacBook, so I try my luck here.
 ​
 Hope anyone can help me.

 The following error shows up when I try to sign in with Teams on Android:
 Message: AADSTS50020: User account 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' from identity provider 'https://sts.windows.net/11583268-b950-43d0-87ad-50b5dbf95aaa/' does not exist in tenant 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy' and cannot access the application '29d9ed98-a469-4536-ade2-f981bc1d605e'(Microsoft Authentication Broker) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account.
 "Does not exist in tenant" ist just complete BS because I can log in with the account into office.com, the M365 Admin Center and Teams works just fine on my PC. Also online through Chrome/Edge. They also correctly ask for MFA.
 Steps tried so far:
  
Deleted data and cache on phone for the phone app
 Uninstalled and re-installed the phone app
 Removed the work account under accounts and added it again on the phone
 Revoked my MFA in AAD and re-added it again to try and refresh the account
  
What am I missing? Has anyone had this before?

 I have read a few posts here to try and educate myself about Windows Server and what I should be doing. 
 I have some 46 years in IT but unfortunately I know next to nothing about the best way to set up servers for a SaaS type environment. Hoping I can get some feedback / guidance please. 
 My objective is to set up a Dedicated server initially in the best and cheapest way, with the view as hopfully things grow, I can then get additional hardware as required. 
 Currently I have a Dedicated server with OVH as follows ; 
 Windows 2016 Server Standard, MSSQL 2017, 32GB, 2x2TB Drives, Plesk, Intel E3-1260 V6 
 My couple of user facing sites are Wordpress but the actual technology for the businesses are written in ASP using MSSQL. This all runs on the current server config mentioned. No Virtual Machines. 
 My questions are along these lines ; 
 a) should I set up a VM to run MSSQL (and or other things) or is it fine to just run everything as is off the one server environment.
 b) currently running the Intel E3-1260 V6 but I can move to Intel Xeon E-2136 as a special offer, for an extra $6 pm. Should I ? Is it worth the effort to migrate ?
 c) I am in Australia and the server is located in Canada. Lag is pretty bad. I can move to a server in India which is a new offering. Singapore might be another option. Does anyone have any feelings / suggestions as to whether it would be advantageous to move to OVH India as opposed to Canada as far as lag would be concerned ?
 That's all I can think of for now. 
 Thanks in advance for any feedback / suggestions. 
 Cheers

 So... I am an 1st level IT-supporter on a daily basis and work mostly in RDP to our Management (and other) servers, at the same time that our Service Desk and file location is a Cloud solution. We are also using TeamViewer as our remote support tool. Cloud solutions are just becoming more and more relevant for everything.
 The Windows computer is therefore an overkill of a work tool as it costs a lot of money and requires a lot of maintenance + that you also get a work phone as well.
 I have the idea of only using a Samsung Galaxy S23 (or maybe S23 Ultra) as my primary work tool with DeX, which gives me the ability to work with a desktop, just like on a Windows. Then download Microsoft Remote Desktop App, PingTools Network Utilities and other relevant Apps that make my working day productive, smarter and funnier.
 Do you have any experience of working only with a Samsung Galaxy S23 phone (and maybe as an IT-supporter or Sys-admin)? What are your advantages and disadvantages? Which apps would you recommend using? Maybe something else?
 Thanks. Looking forward to hearing your experiences, opinions and recommendations.

 Does anyone know if deleting a user with device enrollment manager permissions takes off all the devices that user enrolled from Intune? It's the only reason I can think as to why multiple devices may have gone from Intune overnight.

 I found out company B's security is none existent. Think of a best practice and are likey not even close to following it. Originally I was given the go ahead to fix things. I started making changes to correct the issues. Today I was brought into a meeting with the HIPAA privacy officer for company A and senioer managment in both companies A and B. I was told to stop all remdiation in company B. 
 Reason is managmnet says company B currently cannot handle the changes being made. They feel its overwleming the users. I told them my objections to this coruse of action but was ignored. I was told by the HIPAA privacy officer that patient care is #1 priority and that security changes could not interfer with operations. 
 Frankly I am thinknig of just quiting tomorrow and finding another job. I have sent a email outlining what was said in the meeting and my objections. I feel dumbfounded. Am I wrong here? Dose HIPAA not matter if it would cause possible issues with Patient care? I dont understand honestly It feels very shady. 
 All I can say is I am super depressed after today, I feel like everything I have worked for is crumbling.

 I would like to restrict source IPs that could query for the A record for this certain service of mine. Everyone else would get returned either a NXDOMAIN, a 0.0.0.0 or anything else different than the IP of the service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you think there is a place in IT for people that cannot problem solve? I fully believe in developing people and giving people chances to learn and grow but over the past few years I've noticed study decline in the ability of new hires to problem solve. It has me wondering if this is an issue with the quality of the training, an issue with the quality of the skill set and its match to entry level help desk, or maybe even the covid learning regression that everybody has been talking about.
 I can easily spot someone lacking critical thinking skills when they work smoothly within set protocols, but get totally stuck and need help from a supervisor or colleague when faced with something unexpected. It's like they prefer routine and can't handle new stuff – they seem kind of aloof from independent thinking. 
 Thoughts anyone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m CTO. Another C-suite tripped an alarm by using a VPN that goes to a cloud virtual desktop / domain. He uses a password to access some cloud (AWS or AZURE) and from there launches RDP to some VM.
 I shut it down at the end of the day to give myself reasons that this isn’t OK.
  
a terrible MSP with a bad track record set this up for him, I’d sooner daily drive Windows ME than use these clowns
 
the guy is massively dunning krugered, good at excel means you know IT and infosec
 
I suspect they runs generic AV on other domain 
 
The other company surely has monitoring and network access to us when he opens that tunnel
 
I am being told he isn’t accessing anything but RDP, but at the very least it’s also radius or Kerberos I assume
 
My first thought is he doesn’t understand our network is his network when using a VPN and vs.
 
I’m concerned about malware on his side, but he should be concerned from both sides
 
I need alternatives. What the “right” way to do this would be.
 
I know right-right is to make him use a second laptop and the guest wifi. But, that probably won’t fly, at least he’ll fight it
 
 Anything else I should be concerned about? Any way to harden this? I’d also take things to embarrass him with, anything to further corrective behavior.
 Thoughts?

 Quick preface: ive been in telecom for about 4 years and have a good bit of experience in fiber, Copper, Access Controls, Cameras, Radios, you name it and ive probably touched it or been around it on a job.
 I have a pretty decent understanding of networking theory and Im studying for Network+ at the moment. Its all coming to me pretty easy because of my telecom background and having a background in computers/tech.
 My question to you networking professionals out there would be what would be a good way to get my foot in the door to this industry? would it be through certs? talking to recruiters? A little of all? Any advice/stories would help me in my journey to switch up career paths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So long story short, one of two HP 5412Zzl switches died, functioning as a core switch. 
 core switch 1 failed, and core switch 2 was "salvaged" to recover it.
 during disaster recovery modules were moved from core switch 2 into core switch 1 and reconfigured to accommodate. 
 another 5412zl failed elsewhere on site, and was completely converted to new switches, thus is no longer needed. 
 the issue was discovered to be bad RAM module, (PC-3200U CL3, ancient). but I happen to be a pack rat, and had like 20 dimms at home.
 modules have been recovered from the 5412zl that's no longer needed, and core switch 2 is now operational. modules are reloaded into core switch 2, and we are attempting to reconfigure ports and running into difficulty.
 even basic commands like shut/no shut, give "invalid input: shut".
 "sh int brief" shows all the ports on the modules, "sh modules" shows all the modules. 
 I've tried rebooting the switch.
 reseating the module 
 changing control planes 
 changing RAM.
 all switches were running the same boot ROM, and OS version
 currently I'm thinking "sh modules" and then "no module x" for every one of them then, then reboot.
 anybody familiar with this issue? I'm hoping to resolve this issue without destroying the existing config (which I have backed up anyways)

I have different VLANS across the office that I want to be able to PXE boot into that server from other addresses. This is new territory for me and I have been playing with DHCP relays(Unifis versions of DHCP Helpers) to no avail. I am running DNSmasq on the fog server but I am not really sure if that has something to do with this. I really want any client to be able to ping as well as access this machine sitting at 192.168.0.100 as well as 192.168.0.5 but I cannot seem to get my firewall rules in Unifi to allow this either at least the pinging part. But overall the DHCP PXE boot stuff is most important, works perfectly as long as my client is on the native VLAN but I dont want my whole org on that subnet. Thanks everyone I know this is probably super basic stuff for real admins.

 This my first time trying to design networking for multiple sites. I'm looking for best practices for the following:
 Addressing for multiple sites. Should you subnet each site and each site VLAN or should you have a big pool that spans sites for things like wifi, phones, workstations, guests?
 Currently DHCP is independent at each site with a local failover. At small remote sites where a local failover is not possible or there is no local DHCP at all (single or no server) what is best practice for DHCP? Failover with another site or multiple sites if no local DHCP?
 Appreciate your help.

 Adobe Support just seems to be siloed into an insane bureaucracy of multiple tiers and product support instances that can only do one thing well. If your support request than falls outside that one thing you get ping ponged over to another team that has no context of your issue. so you end up explaining your issue over and over and over again with no end result.

 I got headhunted on LinkedIn. Posting looked interesting. For context: I have 17 years experience in Infrastructure, with the last 9 years running a company's complete IT setup from stem to stern. Vendor Management, Support, Infrastructure refresh, Azure migration...if you do it in IT in a smaller company, I've done it.
 Returning to this headhunter. Pay is about a 20% increase to do LESS work than I do now. A little more high level but WELLLL within my wheelhouse.
 I got rejected after doing a personality test. Can I tell you how absolutely frustrating that is?
 I never even got to talk to the hiring manager. I got weeded out by the professional equivalent of "What Harry Potter House would you be in?"
 The kicker? They reposted the job 2 days ago on LinkedIn.

 I'm going through the BGP Communities lesson on NetworkLessons.com, and it has a scenario we in which a customer router is connected to an ISP, and that ISP is connected to two other ISPs, one in Europe and one elsewhere. It has a community value option to prepend its AS four times routes leading to the European ISP for customers that choose to use a certain community value. But given that different customers may have different customized requirements besides AS prepending (or even different expectations for prepending, like 3 prepends instead of 4), how does the ISP overcome the limitation of one route map per neighbor (per direction)? Thank you.

 We got internet coming into a small managed switch, and that switch is then providing uplink to our WAN port on our Firewall. But then.. our Main Switch #2 is getting internet connectivity on from that SAME small switch too.
 So 2 sources of internet connectivity. The Firewall isn't indicating any loops or anything like that, but I am being told that this might be the reason why internet is malfunctioning at our office. This is meraki equipment.
 A. Main internet connects too -> small switch #1B. Small switch #1 connects to our Firewall's WAN port.C. small switch #1 connects to our Main Switch #2 - where computers get internet from.D. Firewall is connecting too -> Main switch #2.
 So 2 connections doing the same thing. Any thoughts? Thank you!! 
 The only thing this small switch #1 is doing, is providing uplink/network connectivity to the Firewall, and our switch, it does nothing else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing a lab, I have 2 sites one main, one satellite, both connect to an ISP. I intend for the satellite to be entire RFC 1918 and be routed directly back to the main site to go through a firewall before going back to ISP for internet.
 Now... I have ZERO experience working with an ISP, I have been DoD my whole life and the rules are different so bear with me on my self-made constraints.
 I don't want the satellite to be globally routable, I want it to be composed entirely of private IPs. (I don't know if this is how it works in the real world to be honest, do companies purchase public IP space for every satellite site?)
 So how would an ISP handle this? I am tempted to put the satellite entirely on a VRF and use MPBGP vpnv4 to route back to the main site, but I feel like there is a way to keep the satellite on the global routing table and then just be on a vrf at the main site till it reaches the FW.
 Am i making sense? How would the configs look on the PE/CE side of the satellite site? I am drawing a blank.
 Also, if this isn't how a situation like this is normally done as well, please let me know. I'm trying to lab practical examples, but not very creative.
 Bonus question: I also have not gotten to the ASA portion, but if anyone knows and wants to confirm my thought, I was going to sub interface the satellite site from the router to ASA and on the ASA side create a semi trusted zone. But I haven't worked with the ASA enough to know if it supports sub interfaces and if 1 physical port can exist in two zones or if ill need a 2nd connection.

 Thanks!

 I know I can do it with SNMP MIBs against the power supply for at least the network gear they are proposing to install but they were asking about outlet-level metering (outlet control would be nice but is secondary to cost). 
 OK. I'm game. My Google-fu results have me cross-eyed again so I'm coming back to the hive mind.
 My current wiring is L5-30 input with 20-24 5-20 outputs. Re-wiring isn't an option.

 Anyway, we have a Kerio Control NG310 connected between our FiOS and internal office network. I needed to set up a IPsec VPN connection to some remote sites via T-Mobile's cellular Private APN network, but they require BGP for routing, which the Kerio does not do.
 Could I connect, for instance, a Ubiquity ER-X EdgeRouter X, to one of the LAN ports on our Kerio and configure it to make the VPN BGP connection to T-Mobile's network?
 I am up for most ideas (to make this BGP VPN tunnel work) short of replacing the Kerio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team and I moved into an office about a year ago that had label on the door that said "Video Game Room", the previous tenants must have used it for that purpose. We found that many people would knock simply out of curiosity, or ask about it. Instead we put a label that said "IT Department" along with a short, detailed message about how we no longer accept in-person requests, and to please submit a ticket (along with a QR code which directs to a form submission). However people will see "IT Department" and simply knock anyway, glossing over the message and QR code. I asked a few people and they said they basically didn't see it. Selective vision I guess.
 Anyway, I'd like to replace our label with something that will almost guarantee nobody knocks unless they know that we actually occupy this office. Most people are remote and only attend the office on occasion, so the people who know we're in here are few and far between.
 I was thinking "Electrical" would probably work fine.
 What would you put?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi at all,
 I need your advice how to properly copy my pictures from one to another backup drive on Windows 11.
 I manage all my pictures with Lightroom and have those pictures on my internal SSD.
 Once done with editing, I move them with Lightroom to an external HDD as first backup.
 I now want to create a second backup on an external SSD by copying the HDD 1 by 1 to it.
 In the past I used Hetzner Storage Box with rSync but as i don't want to store my backup in the cloud anymore I ask myself if rSync is still the right tool to copy from HDD to SSD or if maybe robocopy is a better choice.
 Is there anything I have to pay attention to when copying from HDD to SDD - any special commands?
 Thanks in advance for sharing your experience and help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 For some time now, we have been toying with moving files from our onprem infra to Teams environment. Some background first, we have 10ish locations around the world, each location has between 20 and 60 people. Each location has local infra with servers for failover dhcp, dns, printing etc. Our DC's have been moved to aws few years back. DC's run dhcp and dns, AD, nap etc. No issues since we moved them. Each location also has 2 Synology units, one hosting all files and folder shares and second for backup. File and folder shares range between 500GB and 1.5TB organized mostly by dept. Over the last few years we migrated some "easier" departments from onprem to Teams/OneDrive. Once migrated users would simply go to Teams, their Team name, files and click on Sync and this would give users familiar access to files rather than accessing files through Teams interface. Apart from some occasional issues (mostly caused by Microsoft) we haven't had any real issues with this solution.
 We are running hybrid AD/AAD. Auto pilot deployments, MFA and conditional access have been implemented. Only domain joined equipment can access O365 environment.
 Now we are thinking of taking a plunge and simply migrating all sites and all departments. There are some debates over this as advantages are mostly for IT with few exceptions for end user, such as files are available anywhere, no need for VPN. 
 There is also some chatter that storing files in Teams gives you better protection against crypto viruses but not sure how much and if true.
 We have also not considered any backup yet. Management is saying that 90 days is good enough because anything older than 90 days is useless anyway. 
 Has anyone done something similar, pros and cons, ideas, real life best practices appart from Microsoft is suggesting.
 Also, we are small IT team, 2 ppl, one in NA and one in EU. Yes we do it all.

 I am currently looking into this and I see how to do it using OnPrem servers for Domain joined as well as InTune/Azure for AzureAD joined computers, but we have a mixture of both.
 Will I need to manage both types of computers seperately or can I do them all in AzureAD/InTune? We are in a Hybrid environment where our OnPrem AD syncs with AzureAD.
 Looking for tutorials and finding them for each type but nothing explaining if you're in a hybrid environment.
 Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in my current organization for over 15 years, starting from the help desk at Tier 1 and have moved up through the ranks over the years to eventually be where I am now, the network admin. I really enjoy what I do and from the IT side at least, the work is far more meaningful and significant. The role is of course much different though, I rarely directly interact with the staff and most of what I do, at least if it's done correctly, is completely transparent to anyone. The network is really just a utility at this point, no one ever notices it unless there's a problem. 
 Doing some housekeeping on my (very) old files, I came across all of my work from back in the help desk days. It reminded me how things were much different back then, I interacted with pretty much all of the staff in the building regularly. The work I did, even though it was mundane nonsense like maintaining labs and carts, was completely visible. Since the help desk is the first point of contact for anything, I also worked directly with our tech time much closer than I do today. Unlike today, work back then was appreciated, even if it was something very basic because it directly helped someone. Many of the work relationships I built and the reputation I built came directly from the work I did back then. 
 Maybe I'm just feeling overly nostalgic, but even though the work I do today is much more rewarding on the IT side and the pay is obviously much better, it kind of feels like everything else is worse and it leaves me missing those days and interactions. Am I just crazy or does anyone else who made this same journey feel the same?

Email worm sent from a known contact about collaborating on a document. Document hosted in the sender's company sharepoint. 
 
User opens document and it has a URL to an evilginx hosted MFA token stealer. MFA sign in token stolen
 
M365 defender for endpoint, Advanced Threat Protection, Intune office macros disabled policies etc let everything pass
 
Hacker script uses token to sign in with "MFA requirement satisfied by claim in the token"
 
The same worm sent to all contacts (The only difference this time is the worm used a generic free onedrive link to share the new booby trapped document instead of the company sharepoint as anon sharing is disabled in tenant sharepoint). 
 
Worm propagates 
 
 ​
 MFA is useless to this unfortunately. I am researching why conditional access for "only compliant devices" did not work here. Maybe needs the new Token protection condition.

 good luck!

 So they have been out on an isolated network. I am upgrading what I can but it takes time, mainly in the form of explaining to scientists yes I can upgrade this computer, yes it will still work. 
 I would like a program to manage patches, firmware, Remote Desktop session and most importantly wake on Lan (if possible). They love to turn these machines off at night and then I can’t push stuff to them overnight. Being able to manage everything from one console would be cool too. 
 Normally we use SCCM for our domain joined computers. However trying to explain this to our SCCM folks is…tiresome. The one I tested with they just Reimaged and upgraded to our win10 image. Luckily it was a test and I picked a sacrificial machine we could spare. So not dealing with those morons again. 
 I am pretty sure their are alternatives I can use but pardon I am used to big enterprise domain joined sccm managed machines and not used to doing things this way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, longtime lurker here. I have two questions, that I will preface with some background:
 I work for a small company as the only "IT Guy". I recently was encouraged to deploy an on-prem server both in-house, and for one of our clients. I muddled my way through, and learned a lot, but I should have been better prepared. In light of that realization, I started looking into MS Certs. I don't see any Certs listed for on-prem environments. Lots of Cert for Azure, and a few for Hybrid, but not for on-prem only, that I could find.
 So the questions:
 Are there still Cert tracks for on-prem environments?
 Does it matter?
 Should I just follow the Azure Cert tracks? 
 For some additional background: I used Windows XP extensively, in my early teen years. I then switched to Mac for ~1 year, then switched to Linux. I have been primarily using Linux (Arch, FTW) for over a decade, up until this most recent job role, (about 2 years in my current role) when I gradually transitioned to using Windows again. I've been diving into Powershell very heavily (Windows finally has a usable CLI??) I also purchased "Deploying and Managing Active Directory with Windows PowerShell: Tools for cloud-based and hybrid environments" and read most of it, and continue to use it heavily as a reference book. In reading that, I found that the author recommended "Windows Server 2008 Administrator's Companion", so I also purchased that. I have read a number of chapters, but mostly use that as a reference book.

 As the person responsible for these and often tasked with error analysis and troubleshooting, managing these different logs has become increasingly challenging. Today, while consolidating 7 logs based on timestamps, I reached my breaking point, prompting me to look for solutions.
 That's when I stumbled upon the concept of Log Aggregation, which seems to be the exact solution I need. However, there's an overwhelming flood of different service providers, all claiming to be the ultimate solution.
 Based on my research so far, I've been particularly intrigued by the combination of Grafana and Loki. But before committing, I'd love to hear about your best practices for this issue.
 TL;DR: Help needed with Log Management for multiple servers and applications. Log aggregation seems like the solution, considering Grafana and Loki. Seeking best practices and advice from the Reddit community. Your support is highly appreciated!

 Does anyone know whether IGMP snooping + a querier will reduce a multicast packets TTL?
 My understanding was that if the packet stays within the same VLAN then the TTL shouldn't be reduced but we're seeing packets with a TTL of 1 being dropped on the input interface whilst packets with higher TTL are forwarded to the receiver.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far the relationship with this customer has always been alright, at least no major complaints except of some things out of our control (Office 364 uptime lol).Last week though we had an issue with one of their users who wasn't happy with solution A and wanted to attempt potential solution B. After warning them that solution A is much better suited and more likely to work as expected they refused because of convenience and we went forward with solution B, resulting in about 3 hrs of work that they had to pay for and still no functioning solution for their problem because - as expected - solution B did not work as expected (also because we had no expert for it in out Team, which they were also told about beforehand).
 So now with every one of their new requests it's like walking on eggshells because they will most certainly go off and ask if it's gonna work 100% guaranteed, because if not they start saying how we don't meet their expectations for a good IT service provider as we need to be able to offer 100% guaranteed working solutions. Meanwhile they are calling like twice a day because of weird issues and full blown incompetence to operate a computer.
 At this point I'm not even arguing with them anymore, this and all of their open tickets went straight to my boss to deal with. It feels like someone from craigslist trying to bargain by shitting all over your product (while still depending on it).

 I can confirm that simply opening the list and the error populates, refreshing a few times fixes it. 
 Also PowerBI doesn't gather the data from those files in the lists that can't be accessed. Only after a few minutes of retries they show up.

 Have you encountered this? Can it be fixed?

I have 2 ppl working in my team under me tgat help me manage it since we have a lot of work and I am paid 1800€ Net/month (that is with all benefits except yearly bonus which was around 2400€ net). My supervisor is very happy with me and commented that they were looking for 1.5 years for someone for this role and that I was worth it. When I complained about 5.07% yearly raise (just official inflation last year was over 13%) he told me that is max he can do for me since I just joined the company 1 year ago and those limits are set by local office. Am I underpaid? If so, I hear a lot of ppl saying that they work for Americans as outside contractors, how much can I expect with 2 years expirience in Azure, 4 in Enterprise Management tools (Intune/ System Center) and 6 in global support (O365, AD and other standard support cases)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a 400-user org running a couple of 2012R2 servers which will reach the end of life in October. We dont have any files on the servers but use it more for Federation services, AD, user auth, GPOs, print services, RDP, etc. Exchange is also hybrid but can be moved to cloud. 
 Currently evaluating if we should upgrade the servers to newer v2022 or migrate the remaining services to the cloud.
 Servers are a safe bet since its familiar and no change management is required and for this reason I want to stay in the same hybrid setup with upgrading the servers. 
 However, senior mgmt wants to investigate cloud migration options as well properly.
 I've put together both options regarding the cost but can't seem to provide more details on the risks involved with migrating to the cloud.
 If we move to the cloud, we'll have to deploy Intune to replace GPOs, move print services to AWS/Azure, etc.
 For me, it's more about a mental block for making that change because i know there will be nuanced changes that might become a pain, (or maybe not)
 Anyone who's been in a similar situation situation? what documentation would you provide for the risks associated with both options? and how to frame the recommendation for the management?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im lucky to be able to rebuild our entire network / server room as my company is moving in a new modern office building soon. I have a lot of Linux Sysadmin, but only basic / intermediate networking knowledge which I want to improve with this project.
 I am planning on going with:
  
two 42 unit racks for all the servers and network hardware
 PFSense Firewall Cluster (2x Netgate 1541 Appliance, for FW, IDS, DHCP, DNS),
 10GB symmetrical WAN Uplink with a 500/50 backup link)
 2x 48P POE+ Switches for the clients
 4x 24P 10GB Switches for the Servers
 One or Two UPS per Rack, still researching options here.
  
Does this sound reasonable?
 We have about 40-50 servers ( ~ 15 bare metal, the rest vm's / containers on two proxmox-nodes, windows, Debian, a few Centos) and about 50 clients. We are 31 employees and are growing up to 40 in the next 2 years.
 What I am unsure about is on how I would go on on planning the segmentation of the new network, whats best practice for a network of this size? Hook up everything physically together, use one big subnet and then use VLAN's to segment it? Any Links for good Guides, How-tos, real world examples?
 Im planning on separate Segments for
 - Clients
 - Guests
 - VOIP
 - Windows-Servers
 - Linux Servers
 - Infrastructure (Switches, FW, UPS, etc.)
 Does it make sense to run the basic network services like DHCP and DNS on the PFSense Cluster? Of course there will also be DNS Services from our Active-Directory running for the windows-part. Im asking because my predecessor had setup separate BIND-Servers running right now for DNS on the non-windows area, which looks like over complicating things to me?
 I am also thinking about hiring a network-consultant to work trough the design and setup phase with m e, but am not sure its really needed.
 I appreciate any input!

 I'm not a native English speaker, if you find mistakes in spelling and grammar, just write them down for me, so that I can continue to better myself.
 Our company is a small one, with less than 50 employees, currently no physical location, so everyone is working from their own home. Only Azure online services for the time being, we don't have an onprem system at all. Every User has his own device, and at the beginning, some were enrolled via a script to the MDE to be able to control the devices from afar. it didn't seem to work as far as they needed. I advised them to use Intune for it, but to use it via intune we needed better licenses. 
 So we got the licenses and I started enrolling all the machines which were not enrolled till now. Which are like 90% of them. 
 Now to my question:
 How can I offboard a device from MDE, to give the device user full control over it without a complete reinstall? 
 The Users are all around the world, so it is not feasible for them to send the devices back to us, for us to reinstall the device it correctly.

 Thank you for your help

 I've been told that it is a horrible to use iptables (nftables) & fail2ban or even pfsense as a router&firewall in production and I should buy a hardware one instead. I understand from performance and resource usage stand point why it is much better, but I would like to get into details: why virtual router&firewall is that bad? 
 Maybe it's so low performance that I should not even take in consideration, maybe it's really unreliable, maybe it's easy to bypass, maybe it's really hard to configure, maybe it's really easy to make mistake
 I would just like to know more details instead of blindly fixating on hardware (even though I understand it's probably right).

 I've seen in the Defender 365 Admin portal that Microsoft automatically detects these simulation emails and puts them under "Phishing simulations".
 Now, I want to make some sort of Exhange rule that 'rewards' the user after they've succesfully reported a simulation email from us. This could either be a notification that pops up, or an email.
 The whole point of making this is to let users see that they've succesfully reported a simulation email, + minimizing labor to manually reply to these simulation emails in the 365 Defender portal.
 Can someone guide me in the right direction to make such a rule?
 I've already looked at numerous of Exchange rules, but I don't see an option anywhere to detect if a user has reported an email. On the other hand, detecting a phishing simulation of ours is quite easy since there's always an unique value in the email header that we can detect.
 I was thinking about something like this:
 User reports email > system checks if certain header value matches that of our phishing simulations > send notification/email to user who reported the email.

 Or in otherwords, its how the BCC actually works. The SMTP client sends an email to each BCC address, and in the DATA block it just doesnt put their email address in any of the headers.
 The more you know
 P.S. I didnt know what flag to use, so I used the question solved. As I solved my own unasked question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client who is setting up an app server which will be communicating with an onsite database and making API calls to an external service. The API calls to be secured with a certificate.
 In this scenario, their internal domain does not match the domain they own externally. As an example, they own bestsysadmin.com, but their internal domain is internal.sysadmin.com . 
 We have a wildcard cert for *.bestsysadmin.com. 
 Is there a way for be to secure the app server appserver.internal.sysadmin.com using this wildcard cert? I am told that the certificate either needs to match the internal.sysadmin.com domain for this, or the server needs to be on bestsysadmin.com domain for this to work. 
 I thought, perhaps we would be able to use a self-signed certificate and give it to the external vendor who run the API but apparently thats not going to be possible.
 Another suggestion was to add bestsysadmin.com as a UPN on the domain, which I've done but I am unsure how the server would then be presented as appserver.bestsysadmin.com.
 Hopefully this makes sense as I feel like I'm a little out of my depth at the moment with this.

 Why is there no document that actually tells you what the hell this is, and what setting could make it appear etc. As fun as it is going through customer environments, not even thats useful anymore because as of right now I can't see anything that would explain why this is popping up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking at the documentation, Cisco supports complex regex statements such as positive lookahead. However, I can't think of a situation where positive lookahead could not be handled by less confusing syntax that achieves the same thing. 
 For example, if I wanted to set a community value for routes that contain AS 100 followed by AS 200, I could configure:
 route-map LOOKAHEAD permit 10 match as-path 1 set community 65000:100 additive ! ip as-path access-list 1 permit 100(?=_200)
 Or
 route-map DIRECT-MATCH permit 10 match as-path 2 set community 65000:100 additive ! ip as-path access-list 2 permit 100_200
 Has anyone found a good use case for positive (or negative, for that matter) lookahead?

 Not even addressing how cloud-based applications could be wrangled with such a mindset, am I misunderstanding this "USA-only" mindset?

 Mido is a very lightweight open source project that automates Windows ISO downloads to make deploying new Windows systems easier. It supports everything from consumer Windows 11/10, Windows Enterprise, and Windows Server. It's written in POSIX sh so it can run on any Unix system or Windows through WSL or Cygwin!
 It works differently from how almost all other Windows ISO downloader projects work in that it interacts with Microsoft's downloading API (reverse engineered) to always get the newest release of Windows as soon as it's officially released!
 Full disclosure: I'm the creator or this tool. It's fully open source and I'm not in any way profiting from it. Just want to post it here in case someone finds it useful. Thanks for your time!

 In our dev area we are testing autologging in with a group policy pushed registry edit that emulates what Autologon.exe does. 
 The issue is that out of our 3 dev machines, two require a manual login (i.e. I type the password in) after the password is updated on Group policy before any subsequent restarts while one device will auto login no matter how many times I change the password on the registry edit. 
 I'm using the edits provided by Microsoft: 
  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon: 
 AutoAdminLogon: This key is set to 1 to enable automatic logon
 DefaultUserName: This key is set to the username of the account that will be logged in automatically.
 DefaultPassword: This key is set to the password of the account that will be logged in automatically.
 DefaultDomainName: This key is set to the domain of the account that will be logged in automatically.
 
 
 All 3 machines are running the exact same group policy, located in the same OU on AD. 
 Any thoughts?

 The company I work for has VLANs setup like the picture above.
 Port 2 is the uplink.
 Ports 4 & 32 connect to APs.
 (the APs have a guest network that uses a different subnet)
 (there's also a hidden network that uses the same subnet as the LAN)
 (the router is the DHCP server for LAN and both APs, supposedly)
 But those ports still have a PVID of 1 as show below.
 https://imgur.com/a/qT5K91v
 What I'm having trouble understand is.... are these VLAN assignments even necessary if the ports are still on PVID 1?
 I tested the setup on a spare switch and I can ping devices connected to those ports from any other port.

There is some construction work taking place at that location so the 2 devices need to move temporarily to another location but still get the overnight updates.

 Both sites have watchguards and currently different subnets for the devices on site.

How can I connect these two sites together and plug the 2 devices into the network of the temporary site (different subnet) but retain the current static IPs. Branch to Branch VPN comes to mind, not completely sure how to configure it. It may be possible for me to change the static IPs on the server end if I can configure the network to see the other subnet?

Is it valid for the client to send a CONNECT request to the proxy even though the proxy won't be able to establish a TLS tunnel to the target since the target does not support it? If it is valid to issue a CONNECT request in this case then how should the proxy handle it?

 From what I am getting, hosting has to do with lent storage, and from a registrar you can either rent a custom email or website domain, or even both (including the TLD?).
 ​
 And can I register a customized domain from somewhere and use it in Outlook, for example? 
 Thanks.

 We just went through a huge upgrade (or downgrade in the case of Prime!) for DNAC, ISE, and CUCM. We are looking to get our appliance backups in order, but are noticing that the requirements for backing these things up are vastly different from one another. I'd hate to request 3 different backup solutions for 3 different products from our sysadmin team, but I will if I have to.
 My question to those who have all 3, what are you folks doing to backup these pieces of your environment?
 TIA

 We used the Azure calculator to predict costs and after the first month have concerns about pricing. It's not totally over the top of what we predicted but definitely want to try to reduce the cost. 
 We do have reserve instances bought for our VMs. The biggest concern is the VM windows licensing cost. 
 Wondering if anyone has tips on reducing the price of the windows licensing. Doesn't look like we can buy a "reservation" for windows licensing like we can for compute reservations. 
 Would it be worth it to buy windows licensing with software assurance and use Azure Hybrid benefits. Or would that end up costing more then using the Pay-as-you-go licensing costs? 
 Any tips or recommendations are appreciated.

 Today I had a meeting to have some functionality wired up. I didn't see said functionality on my end but the person wiring it up said it was resolved
 So I ask, "I see you can do it on your end, but on ours we don't have that option. Can you double check we have the permissions please?"
 And this other guy in the meeting says to me, "The point of this meeting is to ensure we have those permissions, /u/IWasAroundIWasaround."
 Which to me is a stupid response. It's stupid because I clearly understand the goal and reason for the meeting. Otherwise, I wouldn't have brought up the fact the goal hadn't been ahcieved.
 It's like you have two people - Bill and Ted. Bill works for Ted.
 Bill goes to Ted and says, "Hi, Bill. When is X due?" and Bill looks him in the eye and says, "You know X has to be done by the deadline, right?
 Of course Ted knows that. That is the very reason he asked when the deadline was.
 And they walk away thinking they're smart and you're dumb. 🤫🙄

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm facing a decision regarding our organization's multi-site internet setup and could really use some insights. Currently, we have three separate sites, each with its own fiber internet connection and an elan for inter-site traffic.
 I'm considering the possibility of consolidating our setup so that the second and third sites access the internet through the first site's connection. This would mean relying on the elan to connect the sites and having one central firewall. 
 There seem to be various pros and cons to this approach. On the positive side, we'd benefit from increased bandwidth at the larger site and potentially simplify our internet management. On the flip side, there's the concern of a single point of failure and the potential for one site to consume too much bandwidth.
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter. Any opinions, advice, or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

 We've embraced micro-segmentation with our laptops and desktops so they're out of scope. That still leaves me with a number of printers, badge readers, cameras, IoT devices, etc. that I need to make sure is authorized (~500 devices).
 I have hands on experience with Forescout, but am not a fan of the Java and Windows requirement to manage the environment amongst other frustrations. The other industry colleagues I've spoken with tells me that ISE is overly complicated for my requirements. So, I'm leaning towards giving FortiNAC and Clearpass a shot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[apologies -- couldn't cross-post this from webdev where I originally posted it]
 I have a nginx web server set up to use QUIC. I've confirmed that it's able to respond to quic requests through curl and packcaps.
 when I attempt to connect to it through Chrome (or any other quic-capable browser), the browser never attempts to send a UDP packet to connect; packet capturing indicates that the browser has no problem talking to other servers (e.g. youtube) using http3/quic. with (linux) chrome, I've tried forcing with --origin-to-force-quic-on=<host>:<port> .. no luck, still uses TCP.
 It seems that the browsers will only attempt to connect via QUIC if they first connect via TCP and get an alt-srv header; this doesn't make sense to me since the whole purpose of QUIC is to reduce the initial number of RTTs.

What I've done is consolidate smaller contracts I've done at mom and pop stores and put them into my own consulting company. I don't really want to list every 3 month contract I've ever done. I put the end date as 2022 or 2023 for this company but I've used it as an experience booster for about ten years. It's essentially a geek squad for my friends and family but companies seem really nervous about this? 
 If I remove the consulting stuff, I'll have about six years of IT experience and 10 years of customer service experience before that.

 I have a web application that I'm trying to get it to utilize a https link with a modern browser. I've got the certificate bound that isn't expired, utilized IISCrypto running PCI 4.0 template, and have DNS configured. I can browse to it in http(with DNS name) but HTTPS doesn't cooperate. The website works in IE but I cannot connect with Edge, Chome, or Firefox and I get a connection reset when I do so. The Console log is saying crbug/1173575, non-js module files deprecated which leads me to believe it's a setting somewhere. 
 The vendor is saying it's our side with something network related but I can't find anything that would stop it from working in modern browsers. 
 Wondering if anyone has run into this before or a director they can point me? 
 Thank you

 Documentation says "Your IP routes must be globally unique (“public IPs”) rather than RFC 1918 address ranges. In other words, your IP routes have to be outside of theses ranges: RFC1918" One of the engineers our Sales rep pointed us to, confirmed this.
 It sounds like we need something on our MPLS edge to NAT our internal networks to publicly routable IP's over a private circuit, to do BGP with Twilio. I hate dealing with NAT when using SIP.

It's tiring and preventing us getting on with normal bau work!
 Oh and the best part, we have a legal requirement to answer every request for audit / information under UK freedom of information law, we simply cannot say no.
 It's driving me crazy! A case of a law that is just abused and is a huge waste of money for public finance. We are getting to the point of possibly employing someone to just answer these supplier question permanently.

 When activating Windows 10 Enterprise, it’s an add-on on top of an activated copy of Windows 10 Pro. This Pro activation is normally detected from the BIOS. 
 After you install the local Hyper-V role and build a local VM using the Windows 10 Enterprise ISO downloaded from the VLSC, how does this automatic license activation work on the virtual machine? Does it pick up anything from the host machine? If you manually activate Windows with a MAK key in the Hyper-V guest machine, isn’t that gong to trigger use of another license instead of using the free licensing you are entitled to for one local VM?

 I paid the higher price and the domain name still wasn't added to my account after purchasing.
 The registrar told me that, since it is a premium domain, it can take a week to transfer over from another registrar.
 A few days pass and then they tell me they refunded me because the seller no longer owns the domain. I asked for a better explanation.
 Then they sent me this:
 "Aftermarket premium domain" means that this domain is already owned by an individual and that person is selling it via our platform. They decide their own prices for the sale as the owner. We are simply facilitating this transaction and ensure the safety of payment. In this case the owner of the listing was able to deliver the domain to you, that is why we issued a full refund for the transaction.
 I'm assuming "was able" is a typo for "wasn't able" but is this all normal registrar behavior? I feel like I just got scammed out of a domain name.

 Just to be clear i do not HAVE to use linux but i'd like to familiarize myself more with it by just using it as a daily operating system.
 However, since i work as an IT employee in a mainly 99% windows environment i struggle to see whatever i could actually do in linux, all the tools i use to work in active directory, dns, dhcp etc ... are all windows based and i'm not sure if there are equivalent programs even in linux that do not require only command line stuff.
 and installing a windows vm is just a bit ... pointless then.
 So i was curious are there others like me who use linux but also maintain a pure windows environment in their corporation.
 What tools do you use for what tasks ?
 i mainly use powershell and the mmc.exe console that uses snap ins for active directory/dhcp/dns/group policy ...

 I had a question as I am not sure what to do next to fix my network issues.
 I am using a windows PC with a TP link wifi card. It has been great in the past and is a good wifi card. I don’t believe it is the issue.
 I have recently been getting my wifi just drop out mid game, then sometimes come back but really poorly (around the 300 mark in cs go ping) but then sometimes be stable at around 20 ping in cs go. This process kinda repeats itself and I wouldn’t be able to get through a game without my network dying at least 2 or 3 times a game.
 I also tried to look at it before and my computer was able to find the network at full strength, however when I tried to connect it was ‘secured’ (then bellow) ‘Can’t connect to this network’. 
 I have checked and IPV4 and 6 are both set to automatically detect/set themselves up.
 I have dealt with a fair few network issues before, but they are always far more complicated to me than other issues so I am wondering if anyone would be able to give me some ideas on how to best fix this.
 Thanks heaps! Kind Regards, Me :)

 When they open the ADUC snap-in and right, click it and run as administrator with their credentials, they are able to get in and search AD, but they are unable to reset a user‘s password. It tells them that higher elevation is needed. Here’s where it gets strange: They can right click ADUC and run as administrator from their account on my laptop and reset a users password with no issues. So by that, I think I’ve pinpointed it down to something on the client. Permissions or something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm trying to figure out a solution for shared folders across depts. One drive has a great Shared Library option but I cannot find out what happens to members access once the creator of the Shared library leaves the company. I have read that there is a notification to all members that access will be removed within x amount of days and for them to remove any files they need.
 I'd prefer if it didn't force members to set up another shared library and inform everyone of the new location. Is there a workaround for this. Does making a few of the members owners in the permissions allow the files to remain?
 I've no one leaving anytime soon to test this myself thankfully so any insights would be great.

Thus, I've got to upgrade the VPN server to UDP/TCP protocols. Also, there was a recommendation from Infosec that we use 2FA for each user. My initial choice was OpenVPN, but I found out that it only supports two concurrent connections on the free tier.
 I need a VPN server that has the following features:
 - free (no cost) for 20+ users
 - supports both TCP and UDP
 - supports 2FA
 - easy to setup :)))
 Do you have any recommendations? If someone had a similar use case it would help a lot to be directed to the right vpn server.

 The one i have currently has been with us around 6 years, and it's about time to retire it, some tips are rusting a little, and most are a little bent/chewed up. It was one of the cheapest on amazon at the time, so genuinely surprised it lasted this long.
 Any recommendations for a kit that will stand the test of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a question related to remote administration of a system. Here's an overview of the situation: I set up an SSH server (OpenSSH) on my Windows PC with key and passphrase authentication enabled for security. I wanted to use SFTP from a remote location, but I didn't want to keep my PC running all the time. So, I used a CMD command to put the computer to sleep remotely, and I also set up a scheduled task to wake it up in the morning.
 I have a site-to-site VPN, and I can see that it's turned on by checking the connected devices in the router (inside the active devices on the LAN). However, I'm facing an issue where I cannot access the SSH session. I'm getting an error code 1005, indicating that the host is unreachable. I suspect that the service was not started, although it's set to automatically start. When I was at home for testing, I successfully put the PC to sleep using the power button from the Windows menu and verified that it worked.
 Now, the PC is running, and I have no control over it. Is this the situation I'm in? Are there any suggestions on what I could try?

Some proper MDM is long overdue. I've been searching reddit quite a bit and the conclusion seems to be that there is no MDM product that does both platforms well, so my idea was to use Azure AD as our directory service, Intune as MDM for our Windows laptops and add on a third party Mac-focused MDM like Mosyle or something similar. Anybody here have experience with a similar setup? I don't have much experience setting up these kinds of things so any advice is welcome.
 Also, I think we need MS 365 Business Premium for every user to make use of Azure AD and Intune, but we use our own CRM product for e-mail currently and most people do not need Office applications so quite a few features of the Business Premium are redundant. Personally I would prefer using Exchange Online over our own product but I'm not sure I could get management on board and migrating the mailboxes would be a bitch. Are there are alternative licensing options to make use of Azure AD + Intune without all the Exchange and Office features? Thanks.

 I have a few questions about Remote Desktop Gateway deployment, and I was hoping someone could help me. I've tested a few things already, and most things seem to work, but not everything. I've inherited a setup where there were RDS cals bought, but never used. I'm trying to set up everything correctly, so there's no problem in the future.
  
Our users need to access their desktop computers that stay in the office. Is it okay to only run the Gateway, and let the users connect through that? My understanding is that I need the connection broker and the session host only if people will be connecting to a special RDS host.
 How does license assignment work in case of only using the Gateway? Do I even need the CAL's? Because I've tried a few connections, and even though the CAL's are installed, they aren't being assigned to users, despite multiple different connections.
 Is it possible to use something like DUO for MFA over RD Gateway, but not require people to use it when in the office, in front of their computers?
 Is there any cheap (preferably free?) way of monitoring and reporting on the sessions? Aside from writing a script that watches WMI like a hawk for RD Gateway connections.

 If moving from targeted to 'targeted for select users' there are certain features that are organisation features and therefore will get rolled back to standard for everyone.
 Targeted release features will get rolled back (possibly 2-3 months worth of releases).
  
I was wondering if anyone has updated from 'targeted for everyone' to 'standard for everyone'.
 If so, what specific issues did you have (for both admins and users), or any things that I should be aware about that actual experience has shed light on, as I need to propose this change to management.
 Thanks in advance,

For few weeks now, my monitor doesn't go to sleep anymore when I lock my PC. Usually I would use Win + L, and monitor would go to sleep after about 1 minute.
 Now for some reason monitor never goes to sleep. I already checked all the basic things with power settings etc. but in the end I found "powercfg /requests" command that shows what is preventing my monitor from entering sleep mode:
 PS C:\> powercfg /requests 
 DISPLAY: [PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume5\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe
 SYSTEM: [PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume5\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe
 AWAYMODE: None.
 EXECUTION: [PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume5\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe Playing audio
 PERFBOOST: None.
 ACTIVELOCKSCREEN: None.
 Lets ignore msedge.exe, since it's running right now and playing music. But even if I close all programs on my PC, there will be still RegAsm.exe running in background and preventing my monitor to sleep. I also checked in task manager, and I can see RegAsm.exe running. When I ended this process, my monitor went to sleep after locking computer, but it came back on in few minutes. Once again RegAsm.exe was running.
 Anyone experienced same problem like me? Any suggestions how to check what's actually using this process and how to get rid of it for good?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 I had a question I wanted to know if anyone had the answer to regarding the New Outlook Desktop. 
 We upgrade our client’s Outlook Desktop client to the new version of Outlook, which looks more like the web version. The reason was that they use Google Gsuite for emailing, and for some reason, their Gmail account wasn’t connecting properly with Outlook desktop. However, they have multiple email accounts and are used to be able to drag emails from folders in one account to a folder in another account. However, with New Outlook Desktop, they can’t do that.
 So my question would anyone know how to do that, or if anyone knows how to fix Outlook Desktop to connect to a Google Guite Gmail account? (Every time we connect it, it says can’t connect to the server and doesn’t sync. But the New Outlook Desktop syncs perfectly.)
 Thank You!!

 We are you usual company. We use AD, File Servers
 Access is controlled by groups. Usual thing every company uses. We have been copying users as is standard and then they complain that they shouldn't have access to something. 
 One of the managers what's a list of each group his staff are a member of to make sure people don't have access they shouldn't. They want it in excel and want us to make sure its up to date. We don't have the time to do it each month and its just another step when creating users. 
 Has anyone done something similar. Ideally don't want to reinvent the wheel if someone has something already used. Ideally I just want it to email him the members of this 50 security groups every month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We have a Juniper SSG in production for a location with a routed /26 WAN range from a single ISP. The plan is to change this box since it's old.
 I am having issues mirroring the configuration from the SSG to the new Fortigate box.
 The current setup has one interface for the WAN traffic (lets say 1.2.10.2/26 in zone A), then a second interface with a VLAN400 in zone B (lets say 1.2.10.3/26) using the same WAN IP range as the primary WAN
 When I try to add these two interfaces in a Fortigate, it says there is a conflict and I cannot use the same IP range twice.
 I have read some about VDoms but never used it. Can this be a good solution to the case?
 Thanks

 How long should it be? I always worry about losing my spot at a potential company because some HR person (or AI, or program...) doesn't know that Experience with devices / concepts X Y and Z are the same as A B and C.
 In that regard, my resume ends up spelling out EVERY little detail I do at a job, and has a long list of buzzwords I have experience with.

 When assistant goes to schedule meetings on his behalf and checks his 365 work calendar in Outlook...he's free, but on his personal calendar he's booked. They are not aware and sometimes forget to check his personal and then run into scheduling conflicts.
 He's shared his personal out to his assistants but it's an extra step.
 I suggested he exports Mac Calendar (personal) and imports it into Outlook and then continues only using Outlook. Another solution is that he keeps both separate and just blocks off time in his work email when he's not available due to personal events.
 Is there a way to dynamically sync 2 separate calendars? His assistants just need to know when he's busy but I also like the idea of keeping personal and work stuff separated.
 What's the best solution?

So if there are two controllers, each controller should have a LUN that is no more than 85% the total usable virtual pool space. 
 For those who deploy and maintain internal storage arrays that utilize vSphere components like ESXi and vCenter, is it better to have lots of “little” LUNs for each VM’s hard disk, or is it better to go with my approach? I’m sure there are situations where having a dedicated LUN/datastore is advantageous for VMs such as production MSSQL servers or something.

The furthest the 3650 can reach is 1.2.3.1 on the 4451, but it cannot ping 1.2.3.2 on the 9504. However, the 9504 can ping 2.4.8.2 on the 3650. Because of the sensitivity of this network, I will not be able to post the running configuration, but I will answer any further detail needed. I would appreciate it if someone pointed me in the right direction. Thanks!

However, we are forced to change these PRI's to a SIP - IP backbone from our carrier. Outgoing faxes seem to be fine but when we receive outbound faxes, some do succeeded but alot of them fail as well or have cut off pages. 
 I have worked both with Cisco / Xmedius support and they stated that it was the carrier that was having the issues. Our configurations are very simple.
 ​
 We are looking into other solutions and one that was mentioned is to have a dedicated internet sip circuit to service our faxes. I am very new to this and I was wondering if anyone has had issues like this when switching from PRI to SIP and if having a dedicated circuit actually fixed the issue.

 We have a little over 300 staff members. 
 Our pay scale will now be dependent on job title/experience. 
 I report to the VP of Technology, and he's asking me to find a job title. I currently dont have anyone working beneath me, but I will be hiring soon. 
 Currently, these are my duties: - Inventory management/acquisition - helpdesk - license management - azure architect - all things azure/o365 management - IT project planner - IT integration with new acquisitions - IT security - All IT onboarding/offboarding - Sage server oversite (we have a contractor that does the work) - Define IT hardware standards for the entire org - Domain management (cloudflare/godaddy) - Entire face of IT for all company announcements, etc. 
 Thoughts?
 Edit: Thanks for the awesome feedback! As exciting as it would be to have a big manager title, I'm going to go with Senior Systems Administrator with 10 years' experience. This will allow me to get "promotion" pay raises instead of "salary" pay raises in the future. I'll go for a manager title next year after I have a team, then IT Director after I have a manager under me and we hit our revenue target. Im still open to hearing your suggestions though, thanks again!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was talking with some of my coworkers today and I’m curious what people think. Is it better to keep going into Network Engineer route, with CCNP, or even CCIE, network automation, etc etc. or to start diversifying to a more “Network Admin” role to grab some Linux, Cloud or general SysAdmin stuff? Things are becoming more and more GUI and automated, do we all see a need to start changing the focus?

 Looking back I know I may have seemed foolish for not jumping at the opportunity right away. A lot of my apprehension came because I will be the only one working in this position within my company so I'm not going to have anyone to learn from. And to be honest, it really wasn't a field that I had a lot of knowledge of and wasn't something I ever really looked into while in school.

 I was working half sick and not focused enough and instead of deleting the exchange index file. I deleted the EDB file... is there any way that I can recover it ? I know I made a huge mistake... never happend to me before atleast not something this huge.... Could use some help to see if I can recover it.
 I still have the exchange log files.
 Additional info Update: I have a backup but the latest backup is from last night.
 Update: Currently restoring to last night... Had some issues with the backup portal. Normally an external party does the restores etc.... and its in a different language.. than what I speak... Trying to do a eseutil after that.
 Update 2:
 Restored the database of last night. Performed an Eseutil /r succesfully. Now checking some mailboxes from the db I deleted to see the timestamps of the latest emails.
 Update 3:
 I checked several mailboxes. Timestamps were shown from today so the eseutil recovery was succesfull.
 TLDR: Wasnt paying attention deleted the Mailbox Database. Focused to much on using recovery software to get the database file back instead of using a backup of the night before and rebuilding the database with eseutil with the Exchange logs.
 Got it solved. Thanks for the help guys.

Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2023-35078 as a zero day from at least April 2023 through July 2023 to gather information from several Norwegian organizations, as well as to gain access to and compromise a Norwegian government agency’s network.
Ivanti released a patch for CVE-2023-35078 on July 23, 2023. Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability CVE-2023-35081 and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023. NCSC-NO observed possible vulnerabili…]]></summary>

 I am looking for a program or application where I can save step-by-step tutorials for myself or others, for example, how to configure a particular application/how to do something on Windows.
 I've looked at Docfx, MkDocs, BookStack and the like, but none of them fit me from the looks of them. I tried Notion, but it's too opaque and clumsy in operation for me. I care about freely inserting screenshots, commands and all that to make the documentation as non-IT-user-friendly as possible (emojis?).
 The documentation will be local, while a pretty cool addition would be the ability to "print" in .pdf
 What do you use and do you use it at all?

 So I have recently began helping a relative with some computer issues he has been having at his business, I am in no way a systems admin, but I have discovered a lot of sinister doings by the old system admin and I would very much appreciate any advice on what to do, and how to replace him!
 For background, this is a medium sized logistics/sales provider in a developing country. The software and systems they use seem to be extremely outdated to say the least and it appears that there is no one person who can explain to me the intricacies of the network infrastructure. NTL, its a roughly 20 computer network. There is no IT department but instead the company has relied on contracting projects to a few different personnel; as you can imagine the owner is quite old fashioned.

 Anyone have tips or tricks for fs logix RDS profiles? Randomly we get that message and it takes 10+ minutes to login and after logging in the servers are basically unusable. Have reviewed and adjusted all GPOs, removed servers from GPOs to test. Reviewed all logs. Turned off AV to test. Basically scoured every article I can find and none of the fixes appear to be the issue.
 I thought it may be storage related but we completely isolated our San to a single switch and it just started again.
 Works fine when logging in with local admin. 
 Anyone have suggestions? Thanks!

Our first try at using W11 machine (HP laptops) and connecting to our secure wifi SSID has not gone well. We are on a MS AD domain, also slowly migrating to Azure AD. Our back bone network is Cisco Meraki.
 W11 does not connect to our secure SSID. We get these messages that states: "Continue Connecting? If you expected XXX-Secure in this location, go ahead and connect.

 Do we need a different cert on our radius servers for Win11? I cannot find anything on MS sights about this.

 I got an email two and a half hours before my day starts. They needed a query ran on the production database server for a customer.
 I get on, look at it, and run it. There was one option they were setting to off, but the server they tested on was a different version. So that one setting was skipped over and I let them know. They were just giving it a default from what I could tell. So I told them to let me know if that would be an issue.
 I go sit down to eat my breakfast and boom, Teams message. 
 "There was no error on the dev server when running the query."
 And I'm blinking my eyes thinking, "OK. Fantastistic? It worked on a different server with what probably has a different version of sql and some other setup than prod. What do you want me to do?" I shouldn't need to say that out loud, but I do - as nicely as possible.
 Then they ask,
 "Can we get new data?"
 I was just asked to run a query. 
 So I ask, "What do you mean by "new data"?'
 And they say,
 "You're know, new data."
 And I'm thinking - do they not know what they're asking for and hoping I'll know?
 So I ask,
 "When you say "new data" what data are you referring to and where is this data located?"
 They finally say, "A backup of X and Y database.
 And I put my hand to my forhead and get them the backups...
 And as of right now, my day begins.
 I would have never gotten away with giving as little info as the group below me when I was working that level at my last job. They would have seen it as very unprofessional.amd inconsiderate.

I work remotely for a startup now which seems to be growing steadily making 100k. A recruiter reached out to me about a position for a company that was in a space I was interested in learning. I have been working in my career 3 years, 4 next January. I've had 1 job 1 year and my current job 2 years.
 Here are the facts for the position:
 DevSecOps position
 Can work Remote
 3 month contract 180k-250k prorated, which would equal out to $45,000-$62,500
 They say they are strongly looking to extend, but I'm not taking this into account much outside of they don't plan to shut down after 3 months
 I know I have to pay my own healthcare, and I believe taxes are paid differently (quarterly?) 
 I would also like to buy a house in 2 years, I am about 29k away from a down payment. Will look for standard 40hr, stable jobs after reaching this goal

I've checked the computers for malware and anything strange, but everything looks pretty ordinary. I haven't found much information online other than supposedly Avast does this, but we don't use Avast. Even worse.. we use AVG (not my call). I haven't seen anything about AVG doing this. 
 Any ideas? I'm considering setting up an SSH honeypot to gather some more information on what's happening.

My coworkers are unaware of their product's use on campus. 
 The email contained a "one time use" download for the upgraded installer and instructions and they suggest installing it against our Canvas installation buy entering a site id. At first I thought it was our security folks and their phishing/scam email tests, but it appears to be from Pearson. I am posting basically because if it is a play to get their foot into the door, it is not appreciated. This is the first time I've had an email from a vendor which blindly sent software to install against an existing application, has anyone else seen this?
 I'm torn between responding, breaking my rule of referring sales to other internal people, and ignoring, but their tactic has created a situation where I am feeling unsure. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Small office (10 people) with a mix of laptop and desktops, all fully-updated Win10Pro. The printer is a Lexmark XM7155 copier, about 7-8 years old. It has a static IP on the network.
 Computers are configured with it as a network printer and it works great - until it doesn't. Occasionally (couple times a month), someone will lose the ability to print. They try to print a document, the printer makes the usual noises (fans coming on as it wakes from sleep, etc), but nothing comes out. The computer thinks it sent the document, so there's nothing left in the queue. 
 The only fix I've found is to remove the printer device from their computer and re-add it as a network printer. Only takes a moment, but it's a pain since usually they printed a bunch of stuff before noticing that nothing came out and now they have to figure out what they tried to print. 
 Given that remove/readd on the computer fixes it, I think it's a driver/windows issue rather than the printer itself. However, it only happens to 2 users. All the rest of the office has never had this happen. It's possible that it's just because they're heavier printer users, but not sure. 
 Any ideas of where to bang my head on next? I've tried installing the full Lexmark printer driver, but that takes FOREVER and doesn't help. Now I just add it as a network printer from the Windows add device process, put in the IP address, and let Windows use a basic printer driver. It's quicker and doesn't seem to matter. 
 update: hm, I'm not sure if I've tried just restarting the spooler service. Next time they have a failure I'll try that.

 At first glance, VRRP appeared to be the total solution - hardware + ISP/WAN redundancy. However, I learned that I was wrong in that assumption after a bit more reading. VRRP is only intended for router failure, not downstream route failure.
 What is the best option here? Ideally, we want gateway failover AND WAN failover.
 I have to look into this further, obviously, but my first assumption is that each device in a VRRP group could be configured to use either ISP. If gateway1 fails, gateway2 takes over and/or if either device loses its connection on one of its WAN ports, it uses the other. Is this the correct thinking?

 If we run them in 8 core is that licensed as 8 cores or is it 12? I can't find any guidance on this.
 All of the other 8 core CPUs are either trash (bronze) or wildly overpriced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have been thinking about the configuration of patching our servers with WSUS in a new enviroment as we've configured WSUS to use SQL server for the DB.
 Our WSUS server is using a SQL server database for the susdb instance. the SQL server is a separate server.
 WSUS is applying updates to all of our servers automatically on a Saturday, this includes the SQL server where the susdb is running. I am wondering what will happen with WSUS when the SQL server is rebooting after the monthly updates are installed while WSUS services are still running? Is WSUS able to run without a DB connection for the time that the SQL server is offline or will it get into error state and potentially ruin the update cycle (reports)?
 Been searching the web on this topic but have not found what I am looking for, hopefully some of you can help me out.
 Thanks!

 I'm interested to know how you are informing your new users of their initial password. Currently new users are automatically created using a powershell script which pulls data from our HR system. This contains the users mobile phone number, so we send them a TXT telling them to collect a password scratch card from IT, with a specific number so we know which card to give them. They also have to show some photo ID.
 The problem is that our site spans multiple cities, so not everyone is local to our department, and some staff work remotely, so can't come in. In these cases, we are sending the password over email to their line manager, who can verify over the phone......not ideal.
 any clever ways to do this?

Of course an application running on nearly 4000 servers that's sharing infrastructure with 1500 other applications, connects to 3rd party SAAS stuff, with some of the code nearly 20 years old, originally written to run on AIX and HP3000s, ported multiple times, and gets nearly 1000 updates a month is no where near 99.9999%. But our lawyers are crafty and write the contracts with an incredibly narrow scope for what defines 6 9's. Our IT metrics for SLA only look at a very narrow part of the system so we can say it's the Internet or 3pp if (when) a customer complains we missed SLA. We've got elaborate monitoring setup to provide evidence to customers when they push the issue to show them it's not the system. Of course real SLA at the edge would be closer to 99.99%
 I really get tired of having to do that and just wish they'd let us start building a replacement. But the pay is good and as long we need to keep adding Band-Aids I have a job.
 Btw we are a financial company where if you use any banking services in the North America, EU, Middle East, or Australia it's almost guaranteed some of your money passes through our systems. Crap now I'm getting pissed thinking how much of our world's finances is running on shaky decades old software. And I don't even want to start thinking about my time working at a large hospital network.
 You gotta wonder how the Internet actually still works and hasn't imploded on itself. We need an international sysadmins holiday (and only if it comes with a paid day off).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of ISPs filter port 25 for obvious reasons. How is this implemented on such a large scale? Most enterprise firewall appliances would melt under the load of even a medium-sized ISP and it doesn't seem practical to implement this at the core (for performance reasons). 
 Do they do it on lower tier and/or edge routers? Doing it on edge routers would obviously complicate the rule set, as they probably want exclusions for their own mail servers, leading to more performance degradation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm solo sysadmin at a 90 user company. We don't have any on-premise infrastructure, and it feels like a lot of the popular security solutions are still focussed on legacy. All our users are remote. Mix of Linux and Windows.
 In terms of tools, we have:
  
Antivirus - Cybereason EDR
 SIEM - Wazuh
 PAM - Admin By Request
 Password management - Keeper Security
 Vulnerability scanning - Tenable.io
 Patching - Endpoint Central
 IAM - JumpCloud
 Backup of our SaaS platforms, where possible.
  
Other than tools, I have:
  
asset register
 information security policies, incident response plan
 GDPR / cyber security training annually
 device encryption for all endpoints
 VPN for all endpoints (to a VPN provider, rather than to infrastructure. This is used only to mitigate risks of public / home wifi, and to provide static IP for some IP locked SaaS platforms).
 removable media blocked
 no local admin for any user
 IT risk register
 MFA is a requirement of any SaaS we use
  
I feel like I'm covering the basics, but is there anything obvious I'm missing?
 Also, I worry that I'm maybe using too many products, and there might be some consolidation that should be done. Can anyone suggest any of the tools that might be merged?
 Perhaps phishing training is something that is needed? 
 Without meaning to sound a dick, it seems like there's a lot of FUD in the cybersecurity world, with some rather shady sales tactics that make me feel inadequate for taking a risk based approach - I even had one vendor ask some rather rude "how will you sleep at night if you don't buy MDR from us?" questions.
 So, I'm interested for opinions from people who actually run systems similar to mine.

 So my question is, from your experience, how often does this really happen? So what's like the typical business profile of customers that would want to do this? Like perhaps two financial institutions doing high-frequency trading (HFT)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 Having a pretty strange networking issue in work. We have a Unifi set up in the office consisting of a core switch (USW-Pro-48), and four distribution switches (USW-Pro-48 x3, USW-48-G2). All four distribution switches are using the core switch as an uplink. Recently, only one of the distribution switches has been indicating a broadcast storm (All in use port lights are flashing in unison). I have RSTP enabled on all switches, using the core switch as the root bridge. I tried checking the RSTP port statuses on all of the switches to see if one port was set to "blocked", but no luck. However, the single distribution switch is still indicating a storm. 
 I read that taking a Wireshark capture of the network will help locate the source of the of the storm but that seems to be as in depth as most of the tutorials tend to go. Does anybody know if there is any way to locate the source using a Wireshark capture? Appreciate any help!

 Recalling an email through outlook with exchange appears to have changed recently, previously you'd recall an email and then get an email telling you whether it succeeded or not, what time and date and who to and the subject.
 Now when recalling an email you receive an email with a link to "View Message Recall Report".
 This works fine when sending from your own mailbox, but we use distribution lists as "Role addresses" so for example ["departmentA@email.com](mailto:"department@email.com)" for department A that everyone in that department can send from and receive. A colleague of mine recently recalled an email and then was unable to access the message recall report. I also tested this, and also tested with a shared mailbox as well since we have a few shared mailboxes, and was unable to view the message recall report it just states the following:
 An error occurred while processing your request
 An error has occurred while trying to access this message recall report. Possible reasons include the following:
 The recall was requested by someone else and you don't have permissions to view their report.
 The report can't be accessed since it has been expired.
 A technical glitch occurred. Please try again later.
 Does anyone know how to get around this or how else to recall an email so my users can tell whether an email was successfully recalled or not?
 Thank you, and please ask if anymore information is needed.

 We are looking in to introducing an application between our backend application and the load balancer for granular rate limiting.
 We want to perform rate limiting based on request params (in the POST body) before the requests reach the backend servers. 
 Nginx/Openresty is one we have worked with before but was wondering if you guys have other recommendations.
 Google search gives Traefik as a solution as well. But would like to know if anyone had better (or worse) experiences with other solutions.
 It will be hosted on AWS ECS, so a docker ready solution is preferable and also with a dashboard for adjusting the limits.
 Thank you.

 I really don't see it as a "problem", but everyone else does. :D
 So I would like to get rid of this.

 The fiber modem sets the IP lease at 24 hours and we can’t change it. We also can’t change any subnets or do supernetting. Mostly everyone connects thru TP link access points.
 We have 1 Cat6 cable that is about 200 ft long connected to a small unmanaged TPLink switch and there are 4 Cat6 cables connected to that switch, each also about +200ft long connected to TPLink switches. Wired TPLink access points connect to all the switches.
 Slow network issue...Would replacing the long Cat6 cables with fiber help with the slow network issues?
 IP address issue… What decently priced modem/router/switch would allow us to do vlans and possibly have fiber ports if needed?

I have everything finished and it works great when I am connected to the device admin portal using a browser. But as soon as I close the browser, the captive portal is no longer live. All traffic that connects is no longer is routed to the captive portal but instead is just connected to the network.
 I'm really new to this but can the sg-1100 host the captive portal, or do I need another piece of hardware to run it? I thought sg-1100 would download the html file that I uploaded to pfsense and would use that to keep the portal running.
 Thanks for any advice!

 Long story short: company I work at has an old 25 year old phone system
 Legacy relic of a previous IT team.
 It is so out of service that even the vendors cant help, I traced the originating company through four company buy outs, they have a record of us purchasing the system but nothing else. 
 Basically we have no support and will be moving to teams telephony, - but typically the phone system has now fallen over, a week before teams telephony go live ....
 Ive power cycled the main unit, checked all our switches, etc i do t see anything causing it here 
 It's also worth noting it was fine on Friday, come in Monday morning its down, but I'm the only one with access to the server room and rack keys
 I contacted our ISP, as its doesnt appear to be anything on our end, but that's more or less all I can do. 
 Contacting our ISP, they said any issue was on our end.. 
 but we have no documentation, no access to any kind of management system (not that that would help much with all the handsets dead)
 And of course even people who know full well my position, what I've tried, etc and that ive done what i can, are still messaging me saying: is it fixed yet?? 
 I'm not a magician, I guess my question is how do I respond to people saying is it sorted yet, in a way that they understand I cannot fix it, without being rude, or sounding incompetent.. I'm just trying to push the new phone system install forward at the moment..

 I have a BIND9 DNS server listening to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
  
When I perform a dig @IPv6-address A my.domain.com -> DNS Response obtained but no A record.
 
When I perform a dig @IPv6-address AAAA my.domain.com -> DNS AAAA Record obtained.
 
When I perform a dig @IPv4-address A my.domain.com -> DNS Record obtained.
 
When I perform a dig @IPv4-address AAAA my.domain.com -> DNS AAAA Record obtained.
 
 I am not sure why or where BIND is filtering these records. I haven't specified any such filters. Infact, the only record that works is AAAA when queried over the IPv6 address of the server.

 I'm seriously contemplating switching career. I'm ok atm financially so I can take a pay cut and still be ok. Has anyone been able to jump to a different career coming from system admin role and probably never looked back?

 Somewhat long winded, but I don't think it breaks rule 2 (I'm not advertising, I'm asking), but if mods disagree, please do the needful and remove.
 DM's are fine in response if you don't want to break rule 2 - I have no problem with messages rather than comment replies.
 Our company is based in Australia, but we have numerous staff and office in North America (US and Canada) that we purchase Laptops/PC's, servers0 and other hardware - networking, accessories and stuff - for and have shipped to homes and offices.
 We've been using CDW in both the US and Canada, and while our initial work with them (based on recommendations people here made) were OK - recent interactions and service have, quite frankly, sucked. We've had five different "account managers" in the US in the last 4 weeks (and probably 6 or 7 in the last 18 months), and we've decided to take our business elsewhere.
 I'm reaching out to the greater Reddit hive mind to see if anyone has recommendations for general vendors - I don't care if I have to use a different one in the US and Canada - who would be able to reliably provide product like this.
 We're mainly a HP shop for PC type gear- so experience with HP/HPE kit would be good - and Juniper for network kit, so likewise, Juniper experience would be great.
 We're not looking for something geographic specific - we ship to locations all over the US and Canada (yay for remote work!), but we do need vendors in both countries owing it being so fricking expensive to buy in the US and ship to Canada (or vica-versa).
 Anyone willing to share their "go to" vendor of choice for up north?
 thanks
 Edit : Have several suggestions I have passed on and will reach out to. Thanks heaps to everyone who replied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, ran into this problem: 
 I am putting together a lab work, configuring the interface on a virtual router which is directly connected to a virutal laptop. I assign an address with a /30 mask, then test the connectivity. There is no connectivity. I start checking what the problem is and find the following:
 From the virtual router the address that should be assigned to the laptop is reachable, then I check ARP and see:
 RTR-A#sh arp int e0/2 Protocol Address Age (min) Hardware Addr Type Interface Internet 172.16.99.1 - aabb.cc00.1020 ARPA Ethernet0/2 Internet 172.16.99.2 - aabb.cc00.1020 ARPA Ethernet0/2
 How can two addresses from the same subnet be assigned on the same interface?
 And the interface is configured like this:
 RTR-A#sh run int e0/2 Building configuration...
 Current configuration : 144 bytes ! interface Ethernet0/2 description AdminPC ip address 172.16.99.1 255.255.255.255.252 ip nat inside ip virtual-reassembly in duplex auto end
 Clearing the ARP table on the interface doesn't help, turning it off/on doesn't help either. Tried different images (IOL and VIOS) and everywhere the same problem. I can't understand why this happens. I tried restoring the default network adapter settings in the hypervisor and that didn't help either. In the end I completely uninstalled EVE, then VMWare Workstation, cleaned the system of all possible hypervisor related files. Then I reinstalled everything, uploaded the images (different ones) and got the same problem. Please help me. 
 What can this be due to? And how to fix it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone. I have a Cisco Firepower in our enterprise. I’m trying to create a VPN. However, when I try to test the configuration, the GUI returns:
 “Cannot connect to realm. Messages returned: (For identity policies) The connection test has failed. (For RA VPN authentication) ERROR: Authentication Server not responding.”
 I ran a Test-NetConnection on the LDAPS Port 636 on my laptop which returned successfully. I installed our domain’s CA certificate on the firewall. 
 When I entered the CLI, I couldn’t ping the domain controller but I’m wondering if that’s due to some ACLs going on.
 Any suggestions? Thanks, guys.
 Edit: Correct DNS server is in the firewall as well as a static route. We have a site-to-site VPN that has an ACL tied to it that allows traffic. Connecting to this DC is through the tunnel and to the other site.
 Edit: ACLs essentially allow all traffic outbound. Blocks everything else.

 The reason I mentioned chuckling is I was laid off on 2017 and got to play musical chairs with my career over the past 4 years before finally landing in another stable job and every place has a senior leader who came back from a convention or call and all of the sudden SRE was the hot topic while everyone went on about their day doing what they always do.
 For me I'm just hoping for an extra 20% or so pay raise for this fancy new title. (I can laugh at that too)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All,
 Currently working for a small ISP/Data company and decided to take on a small side project. Looking for a solution (Free or Paid) that can do the following,
  
Provide info on ports, whether they are open/closed. If they can provide more information beyond open/closed then that is a plus. SIP ports, H323, RTP, Inspections, etc.
 
Analyze VOIP traffic 
 
Test and monitor network connections. 
 
 Main purpose of this tool is to make it easier for us to determine if the customer's network is ready for VOIP deployment and to assist with troubleshooting (for example, one way audio, packet loss, jitter, etc). 
 Our plan is to either deploy a small NUC device onto the customer site or install a program (that is potentially controlled by a satellite master program). 
 Windows or Linux, doesn't matter.
 Any ideas? So far I've looked at LibreNMS, Voipmonitor, Homer, PRTG, or a combination of some of the ones I've mentioned.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I will try to make a long story short
 Joined a company, no other IT member on board, little to no documentation on the companies infrastructure, 2 seperate buildings connected with a ~50meters single duplex fiber cable
 After some weeks of learning the network, the fibre connection between the buildings goes dark The (super old HP) uplink switch with the fibre transceiver died. Swapped both switches on both ends out but the old transceiver weren't useable in my new switches
 Throwing in new 850nm 10GBase-SR SFP+ transceivers that I have plenty in stock since that's what we use everywhere else, but still no connection Called an electrician, comes in and checks the fiber. He shows me an OTDR protocol which states: OM3 G50/125, distance test 200meters, 1300nm successfull
 I asked the electrician if he can also check for 850nm but he said his OTDR module can only do 1300nm on multimode fiber
 I checked the old transceivers and they are original HP 1310nm SFP+
 Is it possible that 850nm on an OM3 isn't working while 1300nm is working? I run this setup everywhere else with the exception that everything else connected this way is directly patched, like server to switch or switch to switch without walled cables
 Any ideas whats going on here? I'm willing to buy new 1310nm transceivers for me current switches but I want to understand what the issue is here
 Edit: after the HP switch died, I used 2 Arubas with genuine Aruba 850nm transceivers
 since they didn't work I tried 2 different switch models from FS.com, but those would also not get a link with included 850nm transceivers
 all transceivers would show up on the switches as working but disconnected, direclty connecting them with a OM3 patchcable worked so the issue has to be the walled OM3 cable between the buildings

 My point is to put a focus at cybersecurity standpoint of what would be the pros and cons of each architectural scenario, considering that main objective is to secure the company from cybersecurity threats as ransomwares, data exfiltrations, DDOS, etc...all attacks which can have impacts on confidentiality, availability and integrity. 
 Furthermore, I want to check what are the key differences between security at edge for velocloud devices in comparison with fortinet/palo alto firewalls as I understood in SD-WAN edges we can have firewall rules configurations, IPS/IDS ...
 My point is not to get theoretical information but more in the field experience, and how in terms of design we can get the best from each type of SD-WAN architectures and solutions.
 Thanks very much and if there are any additional information you require do not hesitate so that this post is interesting for everyone working on same topics !

 Now the problem is that if i do an snmp v3 query to the switch, the switch responds. I don't have snmp v3 configured and i don't want the switch to respond to v3 requests becuase it is a security hole. 
 So, How can i block it? I would prefer to block it in the control-plane and not configure an acl on the input interfaces

 Im back again with real world BGP questions in real world application. 
 So Ive recently connected to an internet exchange, I`ve learned prepending, local pref and weight on manipulating the paths. Right now, Im connected in the IX, connected with the its route servers but droping all learned routes and only allowing BILATERAL PEERS prefixes to my network. I went this way because I dont really need other routes besides those handpicked organizations such as FACEBOOK, TWITCH etc, just the usual useful cdns in ISP environment. This IX recently connected GOOGLE and it takes a lot of time requesting for BILATERAL PEERING with google, so meanwhile, I would only like to create a filter from route servers to only accept prefixes from specific AS. 
 So my only question is, is COMMUNITIES the only way to achieve this? or is there something Im missing that will make my life easier with what I wanna accomplish?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With regards to hardwired (Cat 5/6) Ethernet connections, with IPv4 it was possible keep track of which device had which IPv4 address because DHCP(v4) was basically mandatory for any useful IPv4 connectivity.
 With IPv6, we now have SLAAC where when the link-layer connection goes active, the device can assign itself an address with some link-layer packets without having to necessarily contact central infrastructure.
 Do vendors have any mechanisms to (centrally?) record which MAC address has which IPv6 address? Especially with privacy addresses that expire/rotate regularly? Or, if this tracking is desired/needed, is it strictly necessary to go with DHCPv6 and not allow SLAAC (except for link-local fe80)?
 (With Wifi there is 802.1X, and that's technically possible for wired Ethernet, I'm just wondering if there is anything more 'simple' or light weight with regards to 'just' plugging in.)

I've seen that RADIUS authenticates via TELNET in this case and I use SSH for ADMIN user when RADIUS fails, right? Or can I do both via SSH? Radius via SSH and when radius is down, activate the admin user. 
 EDIT: I'VE GOT THE SOLUTION -
 I will leave my documentation for anyone wants it :D from the SWITCH SIDE
 config
 aaa authentication login RadLogin local radius
 aaa authentication enable RadEnable enable radius
 radius-server host IP-RADIUS-SERVER
 key passwordSetOnRadiusServer
 radius-server source-ip IP-SWITCH
 exit
 line ssh
 login authentication RadLogin
 enable authentication RadEnable
 so, thats all. When you want to login with radius you just : domain\user
 when you want to log in with admin: admin

 currently right now we enforce a 15 minute lock on all health stations by default and a 30 minute lock on some special stations like shared operatory PCs because of the high number of complaints of doctors getting locked out in the middle of a procedure (completely understandable). The argument was made (and won) that all operatory stations are behind locked doors and that there "should" be no danger of exposing PII or PHI except to other healthcare staff.
 to streamline this more we are about to transition these into MEM/Intune policies with some device filters to separate that 15 minute PCs and 30 minute PCs.
 I'm just curious overall how complex people get with screen lock policies like this or if it really should just be this simple.

I've pointed a domain and firewall at the IP address I'm using. But I'm getting some errors, I'm thinking its nginx configuration but I'm really not sure what to search and where to start trouble shooting it.
 I put in sudo gunciron website.wsgi and it says listening at http://192.168.1.249:80 (8904), booting worker with pid: 8905.
 That IP is routed correctly through the firewall at the DNS.
 But when I check the systemctl status nginx its not binding and says "Failed to start a high performance web server and a reverse proxy server."
 All I've been able to find online says it means the port is in use and to shut them down and then restart but had no effect.
 Anyone able to give me some idea of what to research/look up, or know of an extremely beginner level nginx tutorial? This is my first foray into anything server related and I've done no configuration of nginx. My boss usually does our networking but he's too busy at the moment and has dropped it on me to figure out.

From time to time, I work on projects that will require deep concentration, but still, most of what I do is shallow work that appears to just be data-picking and skimming. It's like the world of social media "Click me!" "no click me!" "click me next!" Sure - there is a dopamine rush being activated, but it more definitely causes brain-rot over time.
 I want to sharpen, not weaken my mind. I want my brain to be strong in another 5 or 10 years in IT. I dont want to be watered down and scatterbrained like my co-workers ... Most of these "Senior" meetings are people scatter-brained shouting back and fourth talking in circles. Unfortunately, I realize it is a systemic characteristic within our world (not just IT), and how we continue to operate as a whole.
 How does one retain a clean, organized sense of mental processes in a continuously fragmenting world of spam?
 Any books or recommendations will help. Thanks.

 My company recently paided for a leased line (fibre) to be installed as the standard broadband is a terrible 30mb up 10mb down. The vendor has sent a Cisco 1100 4P Router which we assumed would connect to an Unifi AP AC PRO and broadcast a staff and guest SSIDs to the site. Its only a small office with <10 staff and visitors at max so the fibre was purely to improve speeds.
 Now the issue - They configure the device and turned off DHCP on the router so there is only 1 port active that needs a static IP. The AP AC PRO can be configured with the static IP but won't issue IPs from DHCP. They have disabled the ports and DHCP for "security purposes".... I have asked for more info about why they can't enable it.
 Looks like I need to setup another Router with static info to connect to this Router but has anyone else had a Vendor do this? Also what Routers have you used for small businesses that would fit this scenario?

 I don't want to go into all the details, I know about DFS, I know I can use secondary UNC names, but I need both server to respond to their original names... but redirect the share.
 I know this is a long shot as I have been doing a lot of investigating over this... but I figure it's worth a shot someone might know how to accomplish this.
 Let's say I have Server1, it host applications and a file share. The file share is being moved to Server2. The problem I am facing is the application on Server 1 is accessed using the server name (so that server name cannot change and needs to remain). The file share is mapped via GPO, but there are numerous links/pinned folders to that share done via the UNC path (due to the way some of their applications function and end users being end users).
 Is there anyway that I can have \\Server1\File Share "redirect" to \\Server2\File Share? (like with symbolic links or something). Keep in mind, DFS won't help, adding a secondary UNC name to Server2 can't happen (because Server 1 needs to be accessed for an application).
 I am going to be rolling this out as DFS moving forward, but that won't help me in this instance.
 As I said, I did Google, Search Reddit, Spiceworks, etc... It sounds like I am doomed, but you never know :)

 We create the user accounts with a password and use this to sign in initially. We then setup WHfB using a PIN and our own mobile number, then change the authentication number to the new users phone number. We don’t provide the password to the users - part of our post enrolment tasks is to ensure all apps are logged in correctly. 
 This works very well for us and whilst improvements can and should be made so we don’t have to do this setup, management are not looking to change this anytime soon. 
 What falls down is when an existing user needs a replacement device and we need to log in on a new laptop. We have to reset the password which causes disruption to the end user as they are prompted for their new password on their current laptop and phone, which we then have to tell them - what we were actively avoiding in the first place. 
 From what I’ve read, a temporary access pass only works for enrolment and isn’t a solution for the end users existing laptop and phone in this situation. 
 Is there any solution to this where the end user doesn’t know and isn’t required to enter in a password? IT knowing the passwords for users isn’t a concern. 
 (I’m aware this is not close to best practice in any means, but management are unfortunately only looking for a solution to minimise the end user disruption at this point)

 I work for a company that uses Azure, we spend rougly £1.5m (British Pounds) in Azure annually. 
 We currently transact via a CSP model with an MSP, but we're considering moving to an EA with Microsoft. However, i'm wondering, what are the benefits, if any? 
 Primarily, i'm aware a CSP to CSP move is simple as it's essentially a billing transfer. But what about CSP to EA, i'm aware there is a migration but how difficult is this to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I was wondering if any of you have experienced the following:
 If a user in AD -> (Synced to AAD using AADconnect) -> has logged into a computer, then the user is later deleted. Then a while in the future the user starts at the company again with the same information on the AD account the computer(s) the user logged into pre-deletion starts acting up when the user logs in. This includes a long "Please wait while we're setting up the device", and when that ends the user is met with a flashing taskbar and constant explorer.exe crashes.
 I can reproduce this by creating a user in AD -> waiting for sync from connect -> logging into a computer -> Deleting the user from AD and the perma delete from AAD(To avoid waiting times) -> Recreating the user -> Logging into the computer again -> Results in the problem above. I am unable to see anything of meaningful in event viewer, but that could just be that im looking in the wrong places.
 This does not happen if the user is directly created in AAD.
 The issues usually goes away if the user profile on the device is deleted, but not all the time. A fresh start will guarantee the issue to go away since everything on the device gets removed, hence user profile is fully gone.
 However, as we use a fair bit of shared device a user may end up logging into 10s of devices, which can be quite the cleanup job to get the user fully working again on all the computers he/she might use. 
 Any suggestions to solve this without going through deleting the user profiles pr. device? :)

 We use Fortigates to do this for MPLS customers wanting breakout and it works great but the limitation is that each MPLS customer has their own VDOM. This works well but in the case where you had 1000's of individual customers it becomes impractical and expensive to give each home user their own VDOM. 
 You could put it all under one VDOM of course but then you lose the ability for each customer to manage their own filtering. 
 Can anyone think of an ISP which offers this type of solution and if so do you know what manufacturers they use for this solution?

 Any suggestions on ticketing systems? I have tons of experience with Zendesk, but aware of the cost there. 
 Basically just looking for a ticket system that can: 
 - Create tickets + tag 
 - Route tickets to groups 
 - Only allow agents to see tickets within X Group or only tickets assigned to the agent.

But the sideband packets (same src, dst IPs - different UDP dest port) gets dropped on the switchport the encoder is connected to.
 We've checked the switch logs, they don't show the level of detail to see packets getting dropped.
 We can port mirror the encoder port and see that the packets are definitely arriving at the encoder port & port mirror the decoder port and see that the packets are definitely not arriving at the decoder port.
 We've checked the encoder port interface to see the rate at which dropped packets increments and it is consistent with how often the sideband packets are being sent.
 so all and all it's pretty conclusive that our switch is dropping specific packets and we have no clue why... any suggestions??
 It's a Fortinet Switch btw - the connections work fine on other brands of switches.

 I've been troubleshooting for quite some time now, but I've hit a roadblock. I hope someone can provide additional ideas to help me resolve this issue.
 Here's the situation:
 In our IT department, we've moved approximately 140 VMs from one VM cluster to a new one as part of a hardware replacement.
 For some unknown reason, the C: drive of several random VMs has completely filled up after the move. Upon inspecting the C: drives, it seems that the "C:\Windows\WinSXS\Temp\InFlight" directory has suddenly consumed all available space on some VMs, taking up more than 80GB.
 Here's what I've tried so far:
 - Running the Disk Cleanup tool (cleanmgr.exe) and selecting all available options in the GUI.
 - Executing all possible WinSXS cleanup commands, such as "schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\StartComponentCleanup"", "Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup", "Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase", and "Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded".
 - Restarting the system multiple times.
 Despite these attempts, I've been unable to reduce the size or get rid of these files. I'm at a loss as to why they were created, especially at such a size, and why only some random VMs were affected.
 I would truly appreciate any additional insights or suggestions on what I could try to resolve this issue. Please note that extending the C: drive is not an option.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Just wondered if anyone had any specifics you could point to from MS regarding issues when licensing 365 across borders. MS provide "multi-geo" which is related to cross-continent stuff, but i'm not sure whether they care or can do anything about us in the UK selling licenses into a tenant to be used in France or Germany for example? This all stems from one of our customers wanting to consolidate companies across (first) the European region and possibly later globally, and I'd like to know of any pitfalls? (or does MS not care because everything is linked to the dollar?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of you who are programmatically pulling data from your network devices, how are you doing it so that you get structured data back?
 I'm currently in a mixed vendor environment where everyone manually SSHs to all of our network devices and I'd like to build out tools for us to do that programmatically. Some of the devices are newer arista devices, others are much older cisco devices like 3700s. 
 I understand that I can use tools like nornir and netmiko to connect to devices, but even using Netmiko's TextFSM feature, I don't always get structured data back. (For example, using netmiko to connect to an arista device and running the command "show version" will return structured data, but running the command "show interface et5" will not return structured data. I really want to be able to pull out values like CRC errors or light levels and other smaller things.
 I've looked into NETCONF, but it looks like a nightmare of a learning curve. I understand that I need to figure out what yang model I need based off of what OS I'm running and it's not entirely clear what model I need to use if I want to get a specific value or the output of everything that I'd normally see by running a command manually in the CLI. 
 To add to this, all API capable devices running in our network have their APIs turned off and I understand I'd want to use HTTPS, but I don't know what would be involved in setting this up for every device across our network. I've read that it's not recommended to run HTTP for APIs in a prod environment for security, and that self-signed certs from the device also aren't recommended, but I'm not sure how I'd get external certs for our internal devices. The management plane is in its own internal VRF though, so maybe it's not needed?
 Just feeling a little overwhelmed about how to approach this problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I hope you are doing great.
 Nowadays, which are the best and most recommended external storage options to have a complete backup of personal cloud (Google Drive or OneDrive) considering frequency to upload data can be each 2 weeks or monthly. The main goal is to not going under risk to loose personal data from the cloud provider, since I was a victim of this in the past by Google when they removed several photo albums (and their contents), I opened a support request asking for reason and to recover and in the end I lost everything they removed suddenly without a reason and explanation to me as a customer who pay annual subscription. So, after that irrecoverable damage, I will migrate all cloud data (mainly from Drive and Photos) to MS OneDrive (I have M365 Personal subscription). I'm IT Pro by 25 years, however, I don't buy any external storage a long time ago, so I'm not updated to the newest tech available and don't know the major advantages and disadvantages comparing HDD with SSD for instance to achieve this goal. Based on some articles which I read, for backup it seems HDD is better and recommended than SSD because the HDD lifetime is greater and more secure, but I have doubts. I don't care about the transfer speed because the data transfer frequency will be low. It's crucial to have a mirror of the data in case of any problems in cloud provider (MS in this case) and to not run in risk to loose my data again. I was thinking in buy 2.5" size (portable models) with between 1 and 5TB of space and manufactures as Seagate and Western Digital.
 What are your recommendations, tips and advices to do the the best buying taking into considerations the factors and goal above?
 Thanks in advance! 
 Kind regards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey yall,
 I have a very challenging task ahead that's been hard nut to crack for few months now. We are running Google Workspace with JumpCloud. JC was added-on due to the absolutely abysmal feature set in Google Workspace even though we run on their most expensive plan.
 One of our goals in terms of security is to allow access to Google Mail, Drive, Slack and few other SSO apps only from corporate devices - computers and mobile devices.
 We tried achieving this with Google's Context Aware access but the results were inconsistent as the user's had to keep re-syncing the plugin from Chrome to keep their devices compliant.
 We also trialed the Conditional Access feature-set from JumpCloud but it failed because they don't cover mobile devices so by default all mobiles are forbidden even if enrolled in JC's MDM.
 We have a dispersed user population and most work from home so its a real struggle to organise this via Proxy/Mandatory VPN etc. in my opinion.
 What would be your angle to tackle this if it was your project? Maybe I am too narrowly focused and missing something obvious as solution or approach...
 Thanks in advance!

Then when I get there a user throws my planning out the window because "I have been getting these weird virus messages since Thursday can you look?".
 What do you mean SINCE THURSDAY? Like we haven't both been in the office that day and Friday. I immediately wonder why we didn't get a central notification, but thank fuck after investigating it was only a browser notification from a website (she accepted and kept getting) and she didn't actually fuck anything up.
 Even in 2023 people are just oblivious to security, no matter how many phishing tests we do, how many posters we have with our 10 golden safety rules etc. Cybersafety is just not on their minds at all.

 First, sorry for my english, I will try to be as clear as possible.
 Where I work, Security installed several intercoms. Some of them are outside next to a barrier.
 Intercoms installed outside are connected with a RJ-45 cable which is going in the closest network bay avalaible. This wasn't a choice. Nobody adsked. they just did. I remember one of my network courses saying everything outside or between buildings should be connectd with optical fiber.
 Several months ago, we were hit by a lighting. We lost 3 intercoms which were outside. 
 In a barrier, we have 2 intercoms connected with POE modules and everything comes inside on a switch. We changed the modules. We changed the intercoms. 
 They randomly loose network. I can't ping them but for whatever reason, they can come back online later. I dediced to monitor them and I clearly a lot of disconnections. 
 ​
 the only we didn't change, is the RJ-45 cable. I'm really wondering if it could be damaged somehow. Could it be possible the lighting damaged it ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I'm trying to introduce high availability for a couple servers via BGP using BIRD on an rpm based linux distro.
 I followed the guide here from vultr and I have successfully got BGP working and pinging the BGP shared IP works with failover flawlessly. But I'm running into an issue as the server still initiates connections from the instance IP, not the shared, BGP IP. 
 EX:
 server-1 - x.x.x.x
 server-2 - y.y.y.y
 Shared IP - z.z.z.z
 I ping z.z.z.z and it replies on server-1 as z.z.z.z successfully. But when server-1 pings me, it uses x.x.x.x instead of z.z.z.z.
 I tried to route it via `ip route` but I think the issue is that BIRD is inherently communicating with the other instance over the eth0 IP of x.x.x.x.
 Any thoughts/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks

So, what are best practices with: - setup of single user… I wouldn’t want his account to be the admin and it says you can have non-email or apps user accounts but first glance I don’t see how. - setup of the laptop… In Win11 should I setup a local admin and then down his account it be limited/ restricted? I see it can be added as a device in M365 but can’t find any detail what that does… Is there even a domain to join?… any experience with this? - any other advice for micro tenants like this?

 The terminals need a wifi signal, which they could probably get from a phone hotspot (there is LTE out there) but the terminals might be 100 ft away from eachother so I don’t think we should rely on that, especially when 2000 people and phones are in the area for the event.
 We do have a barn with power nearby so I was going to bring one of my Ubiquiti access points, but I need a LTE receiver to feed the AP.
 Anyone have any suggestions for good receivers? I’m aware it will need a SIM card, it doesnt need to transmit wifi at all since the AP will do that. Or if I’m totally off base here let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I wanted to post about an interesting issue I found and how I was able to resolve it (and why it happened). I’m dealing with a site that is getting constant complaints about zoom not being stable. And I’ve tossed everything I could at this site, cape sensors, on-site engineers, thousandeyes monitoring etc. it wasn’t until I got endpoint details that showed me ‘packet loss’ to zoom. First thing I did was have an engineer run ping commands to zoom. This returned back (DUP!) for every other response. My first check was to Google why..nothing could really answer this for me. So I got packet captures at the firewall and the endpoint. I could see one packet leave the machine. But the firewall saw two packs. This means I need to check the WLC. I look and see the primary and secondary controllers were playing their correct roles. But looking at the interface statics I could see the secondary controller was matching packets as the primary. I shut off the ports to the secondary and the DUP! Went away. When I turned back on the secondary controller they started back up. In all of my years I’ve never seen this. Long story short. The firewall team turned off icmp on that network. Secondary controller could hit primary and vise versa, but the secondary could not hit the gateway and turned itself on. But didn’t tell anyone that it did that. So in case you hit this issue and are googling, I hope this solves your problem.

I managed to do it with IOS devices but android it seems quite buggy. The network setup assistant hasn't been updated in years and needs work around to get it working.
 I take it people do not use this system to distribute certificates to clients but they will use ISE to authenticate clients?
 What do people use? Are they using MDM now which is why it's not getting updated? It's pretty terrible and feels well out of date. This is using ISE 3.1. I've tried up to 3.3 and same but system quite buggy.
 Help to understand what industry standard is for distributing and authenticating certificate access on byod would be much appreciated!

 I asked the previous company’s support and they said to ignore the docker container coming up, because it was no longer going to happen, without further explanation.
 My question is: what can I do to lock the server, and make sure no one else is able to access it? What tools can I use to check if there are any doors open? What can I do to properly check if they left anything running on the server?

 I posted this on r/sysadmin as well, but thought this might be a better fit.
 I have freeradius3 installed and working as expected after following this guide: https://www.nasirhafeez.com/freeradius-with-google-g-suite-workspace-secure-ldap-for-wpa2-enterprise-wifi/
 The issue I am running into is that it doesn't work with Chromebooks, at least I've not been able to get it to. All other clients seem to work fine, but apparently chromebooks don't work with the Phase2 GTC method.
 I'm super new to freeradius. I tried to edit the configuration to use TTLS-PAP, but that doesn't seem to work.
 After doing some more digging, I found the ldap_google module in mods-available and the google-ldap-auth in sites-avialable. I tried a clean install of freeradius, and used those files the best I could understand.
 There are several things I don't really get, and I've found almost no mention of these files while googling.
 1. Does this ldap_google completely replace the ldap module?
 2. Do I have to enable the normal ldap module as well (I wouldn't think so)?
 3. Do I need to replace all of the mentions of ldap with ldap_google in the default virtual server?
 4. I have no idea why this isn't authenticating...
 I'm including the log and the configs below. Sorry for the pastebin links. I exceeded the character limit otherwise.

However if a user is already connected and the connected site goes down, the connection doesn't automatically attempt one of the failover targets. It attempts to reconnect to the original site until you say 'disconnect', then the next manual "Connect' will find a good host. I'm trying to determine if there is a way to make this process more seamless. I've tried a little tweaking of the Anyconnect profile settings, but I'm getting the impression these are really geared towards ASA functionality. Just wondering if anyone has experience in a similar setup and getting seamless client VPN failover. I'd also take suggestions on a solution that nixes the Meraki client VPN service altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an IT engineer with just over 10 years experience. I keep myself "open to work" to recruiters on LinkedIn permanently, and I've seen more and more lucrative job adverts come my way. Fully remote, outside IR35, £600+ day rates with job specs that are pretty much my current job description. 
 I earn enough money at the moment to max out my ISA each year and have plenty left over to live. But I can't resist the "What If?" temptation. I have a 3 month notice period currently, so if I were to take the plunge, I'd have to hand my notice in first and then search for contracts after, as no client is willing to wait 3 months for me to become available.
 Equally, having said that, I tend to get bored with jobs after about 9 months anyway. Once there's no proactive problems to fix and my day becomes more about BAU, I get itchy feet. Also, my current job has awful benefits and a 24/7 on call policy which is very detrimental to my health and relationship.
 The thought of leaving my very secure, very well paying (70k GBP) job, with nothing else lined up, absolutely petrifies me. My imposter syndrome is telling me that I'd never find work, and then never find a similar paying job once I have to come crawling back to perm with my tail between my legs. Setting up a limited company, hiring an accountant, etc. Spending thousands and putting all that effort in...
 I have enough savings to last a year or so with no income, but is it worth the risk? Would appreciate other opinions, thanks!

If I have traffic set to load balance, we run into issues with certain websites breaking. Usually these are banking websites or others that require login. I have to create rules to always route all traffic for those website domains over one ISP gateway. Is there a way I can load balance ISPs without breaking certain sites? One of our ISPs is very reliable but speed isn’t great. The other is very fast but has a high outage rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any of you out there with your machines AAD Joined + Intune enrolled and the actual user accounts hybrid identity from on-prem?
 Currently we utilize AADDS, I think the orgs initial goal was to use it to hook up to a couple legacy vendor apps, however, the business requirements have gotten so complex that we are extremely limited with AADDS. Would it make sense to have two IaaS DCs in Azure, this is just so the identities would be hybrid, nothing would change authentication wise as we would use PHS, and our physical devices still remain AAD joined. 
 A few benefits here: 
 We can leverage AAD Kerberos with Azure Files and benefit there by finally having the option to utilize ACL permissions on an AAD joined machine. No line of sight to DC required 
 Windows 365 HAADJ Is seamless, PRT token, Hybrid joined and enrolled prelogon. AAD join is also an option. 
 The ability to use FsLogix securely via Kerberos tickets, no access keys. 
 Ability to Hybrid Join virtual machines and auto enroll them in intune, previously with AADDS, a lot of the VMs weren’t supported for Intune enrollment with AVD. 
 Our Vendor had us make 1,000 groups in AADDS and they had to be in specific OUs, so we couldn’t create them from Azure and sync them back to the Root of AADDS, therefore there is no way to sync these groups back to Azure without hybrid AD and not just the AADDS offering. 
 I don’t really see a point of using AADDS when onprem ADDS is far capable of more and we don’t really lose anything. Plus there is zero impact to the users accounts as they are hard/soft matched with PHS.

 First, yes i know, i am an idiot, i am not very familiar with RAID technologies, that's not an excuse, so i am still an idiot.
 Late Last night, i was looking for software to manage and monitor my disks mounted in RAID1 (2 SSD for system C:) and RAID5 (3 HDD for Data D:) on my HP Z640 computer.
 Previously i had configured my RAID volums via the F3 menu in BIOS (Intel RSTe) and wanted to find an easier way to see RAID health in windows. I found this: Intel VROC and (shame on me) i installed it on my windows server 2022...
 Now, after the restart, windows does not want to launch anymore and shows me the repair page and it seems that i no longer see the volume in RAID5 as if it no longer existed while in the F3 menu i can clearly see my 2 volumes ready. 
 I confess that i don't understand much about it. Anyone know if this is definitetly dead and i have to reinstall everything Or if i can find my volumes as before? I've readed some documentation but i find nothing and this is difficult because english is not my mother language. 
 Thank you very much for reading me and thank you very much to those who can enlighten me on the subject.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 so this year we are focusing on upgrading every and any outdated operating system, and we reached the point that it was time to update our hyperv cluster.
 Our cluster is composed by 3 servers + 1 iscsi target + 1 replication server.
 We have 3 networks there: managent + iscsi + heartbeat, where only heartbeat is assigned for cluster communication.
 We started by migrating one server, creating a new cluster on the new node, adding the volume targets to the updated node and everything worked fine. When adding the second migrated node, the node is correctly added and we can see correct voting, but a problem starts where HyperV services become unresponsive and we start to see cluster events where CSV volumes fail and DCM handling volume unmap reports appear.
 We tested and every node can connect to the CSVs on their own. Our feeling is that it might be network related, but we are using the same network connections as before as well.
 As anyone seen this before?

 Im looking to build a cloud gaming service using vmware or vsphere Or building my own server
 Im looking to host 5000 or fewer accounts for games and games like (gta 5) and (forza horizon 4), like 2 or 3 games at most i have more than 10 shops (net cafe) And i have headaches from the pc repair store because of the bad 👎 service and high fees and long time of repairing because of the different locations of my shop's Other problems such as The overheating and the electricity bill of the computers & the AC 
 Long story short, my computers are old enough, and they need to be replaced its like 4 years old 80% of my gpu is GTX 3060 It's more than enough for my customers' needs So me and my managers decide to replace all of it's like a 200k cost that's not USD dollar's, it's more than that 
 So can i do this idea with VMware or vSphere with monthly payments plan or do my own server And use the new computer without Gpu 
 Best regards 
 Mohammad
 Thanks for your help 👍
 And im looking forward to your reply and sorry for my bad English

 during a Wireless Site Survey I've tools that analyze the frequency, channels, interference.
 A customer called me because during the day the devices remained connected to the network but did not reach the applications. Site survey shows me that in the same area there were in the same ssid some cisco AP and some ubnt AP. In a completely random way I found an AP with right SSID but in the switch there was a misconfigured vlan, when a client connect in that AP the servers aren't reachable.
 Is there a tool that test the connection IP of every AP ?

It’s a collaboration tool, and it has its purposes for files, but not to take an entire file server and dump it in the wrong tool. Just my 2 cents. There’s better stuff like Azure Files or if you wanted, old school file server on-prem, or even a third party enterprise tool! Not a collab tool.

 Should I feel comfortable dropping Sophos when our licenses expire in March and switching everyone to Windows Defender for Business? It would be easier to justify the upgrade to BP if I do not extend the Sophos agreement.

 Sharepoint is an option, but is not designed to replace a file share, and is a PITA with 10+ TB 
 Blob Storage is great, and cheap if you archive or do it right, but our org doesn’t want users in there, and rather something more user friendly. 
 Azure Files is an option, but is not secure unless you at least have AADDS, ADDS or ADDS with AAD Kerberos and AAD devices. In our case, none of these apply, we want to retain our accounts as Cloud only, as well as the devices. 
 Azure files in this scenario requires an access key, which isn’t meant for production, and you can’t apply permissions via SMB/NTFS, so it isn’t really a secure method unless it’s test data, etc. 
 What tools do you guys use? NetApp, or Something third party? Those of you who are 100% cloud only, of course

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've put a lot of work into reducing our vulnerabilities but one area where we're hurting is Microsoft SQL and Apache/Tomcat vulnerabilities. The reason it's this way because what happens is an outside vendor comes in and installs their software which usually has SQL and Apache/Tomcat and then it's hands off. The team knows nothing about maintaining those applications so it's more of a leave them alone type of thing. To be honest it seems most of the team could care less about vulnerabilities as a whole and the only time anyone does care is management when an audit comes around. I feel the attitude is "they're internal to our network. If someone exploits those that means their inside and we have bigger problems."
 Is Apache/Tomcat as bad as our team makes out to keep current? Is it just an upgrade over the top that's easy/peasy? As for SQL it's usually nothing more than a service pack goes end-of-life or more so the version goes end-of-life. As I said the attitude is leave it alone because we don't know if upgrading it from SQL 17 TO 19 will break anything. 
 Anyway, I'm getting tired of staring at those usually high level vulnerabilities with nothing being done about them. I want to ask my management if we can just mark them as accepted risks if we're never going to do anything so I can get them out of my face. Any input would be appreciated about these applications. Thanks.

My questions are:
  
Do you use one system for both ticketing and project management or separate systems? What do you use and how well does it work?

 I am starting to dig into free resources to learn more of routing, where protocols specifically fall into the OSI model and inspecting wireshark logs. I am currently learning packet tracer to help lab some of it out.

 One of their old file servers to be decommissioned is accessed by their machines to pull files. We built a new server 2022 machine, enabled 8dot3names and SMB1 for these particular CNC machines and then migrated file shares. 
 We have confirmed that pulling a file list via CMD shows file and folder names in 8dot3. We can reach it from other devices on the network, ping, etc. We cannot get these CNC machines to see or access folders. Any other ideas for troubleshooting?

 I have recently started pursuing my CompTIA A+ Certification. I am learning about network designs and cables. I wanted to know if patch panels are always necessary for a network design. My work for example I believe has patch panels in the communication room. The cables from the wall ethernet ports connect to the patch panel and then the panel is connected to the main ethernet switch. 
 I just wanted to know if there is a reason why the wall jack cables aren't just connected to the ethernet switch and bypass the patch panel altogether.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, I hope this post doesn't get deleted for lack of details but I'm looking for something from scratch. 
 I've read a lot of documents and seen a lot of videos of OSPF Design, BGP Design, how to configure things on the layer 2 network. 
 Layer 2 best practices like ensuring there is sync between STP root with HSRP etc etc. 
 Understood traffic engineering using BGP (Border Gateway Politics) and so on and on.. 
 But all I've seen and read is about how to configure, design and best practices of a technology/protocol. 
 What I'm looking for basically is, let's say if I were to design a network for 50000 employees both Enterprise and Datacenter, where would I start? I know how vague this question is and there are tons of factors involved instead of just setting up random tech but what would be a good place to start? Where can I read/learn more about this? 
 I've read articles and read CCDE material (of course not all of it, but again it's more based on how to design ospf multi area etc etc (just an example)).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago when I was at the helpdesk, I had near constant conflicts with a server admin. It began when the admin found out I was gay, and our work relationship went downhill quickly after that. Over the years, neither of us trusted the others work. It escalated to the point the admin directly made accusations of "hacking" one of the privileged accounts to log into a server, only hours later to find out it was another admin on his team who used that account. These types of accusations (directly and indirectly) continued over the years until he left the organization a few years ago. 
 ​
 Just to address these accusations, none of them stuck to the wall, and only one case did a manager even question whether the accusation was accurate. I have a 100% clean record.
 ​
 Since that time, a complete staff turnover and expansion of the server team brought in new people, and I have moved into a desktop admin position. Unfortunately, I have heard of some of these previous accusations from the new staff, which I am realizing now, has damaged my credibility. One of the managers who left our organization believes the harm of the accusations from the previous admin has poisoned the work relationship with the new staff and it'd be best to leave.
 ​
 I do believe the best option is to leave. I would prefer to stay. Are there any suggestions on how to recover from a damaged reputation? In hindsight, I should have addressed this immediate with management, but I took the approach of trying not to escalate the situation. Letting it linger this long clearly was a mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure this has been asked before, but it's interesting to get all the weird and wonderful answers. Mine's below.
 Industrial client with control room. All machines are dumb desktops running Windows 10 LTSC with RDP shortcuts to virtual control screens, so you can easily switch out hardware.
 One control system was running Windows XP (welcome to industrial life) and every 10 minutes the RDP session would drop. No explanation or warning, would just vanish. This didn't happen on the desktops RDPing to more modern OSs. Tried to comb through event logs for a week, with no indication as to what was happening.
 Eventually resorted to running a WireShark capture on both the client and control system, and captured some funny ARP requests the moment the sessions dropped.
 It turned out that a switch had an SVI onto the network the PCs and control system sat on, but whilst this was supposed to be a /23 network, the switch's VLAN interface was configured as a /24. That meant every time the PC sent out an ARP request for the control system, the switch would "helpfully" try and act as an ARP forwarder, as the address was the "other side" of the /23, which the switch knew wasn't on its network. Got rid of the SVI and bam, problem stopped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, I am colocating 2 servers plus a router/switch with Colocation America. They have already sent us IP configuration information and this is the first time I am doing colocation and aside from that, my network experience comes from homelabbing as I do not do this professionally. Couple questions are: Do I need a router, or will a managed switch do? They are providing us one uplink and my thought is to tag a couple (or all) the ports with the VLAN ID that the IP addresses are on and connect my servers and their IPMIs to it, also tagging the vlan id and filling out the network config they gave us from there (IP address, gateway, netmask, etc.). I saw a comment somewhere on reddit regarding colo prep and someone recommended to "lab" this before going out the datacenter and I am trying to figure out what that entails - do I just mock a router that is configured with the VLAN ID and make the local IPs be the actual IPs, config the switch and servers and make sure they could talk to each other?
 ​
 Also another question is, if I need a router, how will will I make the connection to the uplink? I am looking at Miktrotik and I assume it would be easy as defining addresses to an interface (uplink)? For routing, what would you use? I am looking at both Mikrotik and pfSense. Cisco seems a little more complicated for me and VyOS is something I was also exploring.

 Listening to the analysis and reading the latest Trump indictment, it's clear that the IT guy at Mar-a-lago has being a federal witness.
 It appears he did this because he was instructed by his superiors to delete security footage.
 He did the right thing.
 This should be an informative moment. IF you ever find yourself working for an organization and the people involved are under criminal indictment, and you're asked to delete, move, etc anything.. don't.
 He likely spared himself from being a co-defendant with the property manager of Mar-a-lago.
 You can have any opinion about if you think Trump will end up going to jail, etc.. but make no mistake, the people involved in Mar-a-lago likely will. They don't have his name recognition and their council is being entirely paid for by Trump.. That's another lesson.. Council listens to who pays them.. if you're not paying.. your not the client.
 Moral of the story.. Follow the law and your own moral compass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some way to troubleshoot one Windows client machine that is timing out connections to internal resources inside the VPN. 
 I work with a small company using a mix of Mac and Windows over a Meraki Client L2TP VPN to remote into their office network to connect to a file share hosted on a Synology NAS via SMB2/3. I have one machine that keeps timing out connecting to the file share. This machine wasn’t setup or configured any differently than the others. 
 I’ve checked all the common issues that are shared by all clients - network speeds, Synology SMB settings, MTUs, etc, and I’ve been unable to replicate the issue on another machine. 
 I’ve also tested other variables on the client machine - different remote IPs/connections, different logins, as well as different transfer protocols - FTP, https, WebDAV. I’ve tried mounting the file share as a mapped drive and as a network connection. 
 No matter what, when this machine is connected to the VPN, it can connect to the share and navigate the directories fine, but as soon as I try to transfer any file, it times out and if I’m using SMB it will freeze Windows Explorer. 
 2 other notes: - when connected to the VPN and I try to load a local IP in a web browser, say, the Synology admin portal, it also times out - the WebDAV connection has the same issues over https even when not connected to the VPN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 Lets imagine that I have fully licensed (all cores) physical server with Windows Server 2022 Datacenter license. Hypervisor is Vmware. Guys, do you know any official way how can I activate VMs with, for example, Windows Server 2022 Standard or Windows Server 2019 Standard os installed and without paying any additional money to Microsoft? Licensing info is saying that I have the right to run any number of VMs on such host without purchasing any additional licenses and that I have downgrade and downedition rights, but where to get the keys to activate my VMs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some way to troubleshoot one Windows client machine that is timing out connections to internal resources inside the VPN. 
 I work with a small company using a mix of Mac and Windows over a Meraki Client L2TP VPN to remote into their office network to connect to a file share hosted on a Synology NAS via SMB2/3. I have one machine that keeps timing out connecting to the file share. This machine wasn’t setup or configured any differently than the others. 
 I’ve checked all the common issues that are shared by all clients - network speeds, Synology SMB settings, MTUs, etc, and I’ve been unable to replicate the issue on another machine. 
 I’ve also tested other variables on the client machine - different remote IPs/connections, different logins, as well as different transfer protocols - FTP, https, WebDAV. I’ve tried mounting the file share as a mapped drive and as a network connection. 
 No matter what, when this machine is connected to the VPN, it can connect to the share and navigate the directories fine, but as soon as I try to transfer any file, it times out and if I’m using SMB it will freeze Windows Explorer. 
 2 other notes: - when connected to the VPN and I try to load a local IP in a web browser, say, the Synology admin portal, it also times out - the WebDAV connection has the same issues over https even when not connected to the VPN. 
 What could this possibly be, and how do I test for it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I inherited when I started my new role about 6 months ago was several Windows Failover clusters running on vSphere. 
 In all my years of supporting VMware (close to more than fifteen to be exact) WSFA were a terrible thing to have due to complexity. 
 These clusters are running SQL server with the idea of HA for availability during things like patching or if a host went down. 
 My opinion though is that there is a better way to have HA without MSFA cluster services on VMware and I just wanted some feedback and opinions.
 SQL always on is an option but I am sure we would need to move to SQL enterprise licensing to leverage that. VMware HA services are another option but again, the business seems to think that always available is the absolute only solution regardless of patching. 
 At any rate, I genuinely appreciate the sub's feedback and any experience on this!

 I’m open to other uses for the server, for instance routing all internet traffic through it for security & stability. 
 We’re 50% remote based with a small team of five. I’d like something that can be built on over time. Most of the office uses M1/M2 powered Macs.
 Initially looking at around £1,500. I’m not scared of used parts. 
 I’ve no experience with local servers / NAS builds, but have lot’s of experience building computers.
 Where should I start? All advice very welcome.

 Just have a couple questions about moving a couple devices to a new subnet. Bit of context I am very new to networking but am trying my best to learn. 
 My workplace has a lab environment that consists of two Avaya routeswitches connected to an Aruba switch stack and an Aruba wireless controller stack. I need to move all these devices to a new subnet.
 I have connected all these devices to an Opengear terminal and can connect to the console of all the devices. So far I have moved the management IP of all the devices to the new subnet. All the devices can ping the management IP of the other devices. I can see there are many other vlan interfaces that are still in the old subnet. Am I correct to assume that I need to assign all these vlan interfaces an IP in the new subnet? Is there anything else I would need to consider?
 Thanks in advance for any advice

But like a rabbit stuck in the head lights there is so much. nothing that I have found that is what I am looking for. Does anyone know of any books, Training or websites. that is specifically only looking at networking in the azure and aws cloud. Training that bridges the gap between traditional networking and the cloud and explains it in a manner that can be grasped by a network engineer.
 I've looked at the training on offer and not only is it vast but I can't see a starting point or anything that is relevant. Also nothing that goes through the web front end and shows the elements.
 I admit maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way so really just reaching out for a life line. If anyone can steer me in the right direction I would be greatful.

 I need a way to remotely connect to many Windows 10 devices (based in factories) and pull the modified date of a particular file they store locally in the same place (it's an xml file). I'm hoping to see if there is a script I can run on a server that points to a list of IP addresses of these PCs or their DNS name and grabs the last modified date and then puts all this into a simple csv that I can import into a DB or show in Grafana, but a CVS is just fine. The hard part for me is scripting.
 Do you think this is possible? I have been give a local account these PCs all have too. I'm not sure if I should be Googling PS or Python for this either.
 I think with PS I can use the Get-ChildItem 'D:\temp\test.log' command for this as I tested on my home PC and it works or Invoke-Command {Get-ChildItem "D:\temp\test.log"} -ComputerName DESKTOP-1234. I'm just researching on how I can build a script that points to a source list in a .txt with the remote IPs and include the username and password and push to CSV.
 Has anyone done anything like this before and think it's possible?
 I was thinking of putting Telegraf of a Prometheus plugin on each PC, but I'm not allowed to, these would have push this data to InfluxDB or Prometheus. I have to use a server to pull this info.
 Any advise or examples would really be nice if someone has 2 mins to spare and get me on the right path.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I just want to ask about this network issue that I've been troubleshooting for the past few days.
 I'm currently tasked to do a new segment for our upcoming room transfer. I already set up a new VLAN interface for a new segment in our Fortigate 310B. I just added the new VLAN interface on the port where there are existing VLAN interfaces already.
 Here is a summary of what I've done now:
 Fortigate 310B:
 -Done setting up the VLAN interface (w/ VLAN ID, IP/Netmask). This will be my gateway (192.168.172.1) for my new segment
 -Done setting up the necessary routes (going to internet, active directory, file servers, and other necessary networks) and policies also
 Cisco Switch:
 -Done adding the new VLAN ID on the trunk port (this trunk port is dedicated to the FW port where I setup a new VLAN interface together with the existing VLAN interfaces)
 -Done setting up the access port (new VLAN ID) for my new segment which my VM (192.168.172.2)
 VM:
 -Done setting up the necessary IP configurations (IP: 192.168.172.2 NM: /27 GW: 192.168.172.1)
 -Turned off the firewall also just to make sure
 Now here lies the problem:
 -I can't seem to ping my own gateway (192.168.172.1) from my VM (192.168.172.2) within the same network but I can ping other networks (8.8.8.8, other subnets, etc.)
 -Active directory server, file servers, and other subnets can ping the gateway (192.168.172.1) and yet it can't ping my VM (192.168.172.2) or other hosts of that network
 -The ping option in my VLAN interface is already enabled btw
 -When I tried to traceroute my gateway (192.168.172.1), it routes thru my ISP gateway
 -I tried using an existing VLAN on the access port and it can ping/traceroute it's gateway
 I'm not really sure what I'm missing here so hopefully you can help me with this

Right now all inbound calls to our dispatch center that come from AT&T wireless or any voip providers are staticky. Outbound calls are fine. Calls from Verizon wireless are fine. Calls from other Frontier Centranet lines are fine. You might think this is an issue with Viper except we have a second non-police location that has a interactive voice response system that is also having issues and it too uses frontier Centranet lines. Frontier came out earlier today and decided the issue wasn't theirs and closed a couple of tickets and said they would return on Monday to continue investgating. The problem is our police dispatch center cannot wait until Monday -we need to get a dispatch now and I've had no luck getting anybody to come out. Anyone else ever run into this issue? What did you do to resolve it?

 We want to migrate away from AADDS Joined VDI to AAD Joined VDI for many reasons, including the fact Intune enrollment is not supported with Multi-Session VDI while you are joined to AADDS.
 AAD Join works perfect, however, there is a limitation where you cannot use FsLogix or Azure file share without an access key. This basically prevents us from being able to continue using VHDX mounting from FsLogix, since MS doesn't support AAD Auth to Shares.
 I spun up a DC on-prem and Sync'd a couple test users by performing a hard/soft match against existing AAD Accounts, with PHS as the primary Auth method, I'm able to bind my FQDN, on-prem GUID and Service principal back to the Azure File share on the storage account and I'm also now pull a kerberos ticket from my onprem KDC, which is amazing, this also means I can use FsLogix with AAD Join, as long as my AAD Joined machines have a kerberosTicketRetrieval CSP Set via registry.
 I'm also noticing, since I've configured AAD Connect to use PHS vs PTA, my accounts AND my passwords are syncing back to AADDS, so it's essentially a 3 way sync:
 AD > AAD > AADDS
 Has anyone ever done anything like this before? I'm sure it is uncommon to see my situation/scenario.

 Not looking to go 25G but 10G would be a good bump up

 We got a small remote office that's sub-leasing space in an office building. It's supposed to be a "business incubator". One of the "perks" of renting in this office space is they've had gigabit internet connection for a long time for the whole building. (2gigabit split between the two-dozen tenants)
 This building is an OLD "historic" building. But the interior is completely new. When they rebuilt the interior, each office suite has a storage closet, in each storage closet there is a patch panel for the network drops in the suite, and there is one port that hooks directly into the buildings internet connection. 
 The buildings internet connection ISP was setup pretty good, it's pretty straight forward. If you rent an office suit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, you read that right.
 An executive at my company just made this request, they want every email address/domain an employee sends an email to, be whitelisted. This was prompted because a few "partners" had responses to their marketing messages go to their junk folder.
 Whats frustrating is the same executive requested to have "All Marketing Emails Treated as Spam" just a few months prior because they wanted to clean up their inbox.
 The last email I received from this executive was blasted out to the company requesting that I notify them when the changes have been made for everyone.
 I get Outlook has this feature, but its terrible, never whitelist domains. Especially in the financial industry. 
 I sent an email to our CCO explaining how bad this could be but its falling on deaf ears. Apparently, explaining the security risks of automatically whitelisting domains and how insecure email is, broke the camels back. 
 Honestly, I'm not sure what to do. I've been an IT Director for years, I don't know anything else. This company has put me through hell and back and I've only been with them 2 years. 
 You know that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you're stressed beyond belief. When the realization hits and you know there is nothing you can do to save your job, life, family. When you're one paycheck away from having nothing and someone with power decides they want to use you as a doormat. That's were I'm at.
 Sorry for the rant, I don't have anyone I can talk too. We're a 100+ employee firm and I am the only "IT Guy"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have officeconnect switches with no central management & Extreme APs. 
 I hate being forced to pay a yearly subscription to use our equipment (looking at you XIQ.) 
 We were looking at Aruba Instant On but we would need to split locations up in to mulitple sites and it just sounds like it wouldn't be easy to manage. 
 We have about 15 campuses, 90 buildings - 23 MDFs and ~60 APs spread throughout. Mostly web traffic. On average our APs serve ~5 clients, occasionally they might see 40-50 clients. 
 Should we be looking more closely at Ubiquiti or moving up to the next tier of equipment? 
 Our needs/wants:
  
SFP ports 
 SFP+ for 10Gb would be nice but likely not needed (we don't move a lot of data)
 
 PoE+
 Centralized Management
 layer 3 lite or 
 Decent Warranty
 Preferably no or very low annual costs
 Inexpesnive smaller switches would be nice (4 or 8 port)
  
We do have fortigates - I'm wondering if we should start looking at that line of products with FortiManager. I've heard bad things about Fortiswitches and fortimanager though. 
 Should we stick with Extreme and explore their switch option? My gripe with them is we have to pay ~$12k a year for license/support for APs. We could replace all our APs with Aruba ION for what we pay in one year.

 It feels so amazing, mates! To be seen! 
 It's like a poetic justice thing, too, since I was "Tier 1/ Technical Specialist " at an MSP, worked hard and became an asset to try to get promoted to T2, they brought in an external candidate, gave them the title Systems Administrator. I didn't want/expect to become a Systems admin there, but I was just kind of blind sided, especially since im such am asset and one of the "good ones". And then, they kept carrot dangling us with these B.S titles. More work/clients, more responsibility, less techs, more ENTITLEMENT (please be courteous back! Say hello back, boss.) , and at the same pay and title? Nah. As soon as their bi monthly spiel about how they want to "pave a path for promotion " and "have been working on it" (for 8+ months now...) was done, I got the call. I was tickled. The universe is funny :)
 So if y'all have any tips or what I should prepare for, please share!!! Im setting aside a crap ton of time this weekend to prepare.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on a corporate windows laptop. When I connect to the Windows remote server (AWS EC2) by SSH with Putty, a terminal is opened but it's frozen and I can't use it. The last printed message is "Authenticating with public key "...." from agent".
 When I right click on the terminal window and press on "duplicate session", another frozen window opens. Basically I can't do anything.
 The SSH tunnel is correctly established and can be used by other applications (e.g. RemoteDesktop). In this way everything works and I can work on remote server.
 Problem: I'm now trying to do the same with a LINUX server. The same happens with Putty - a locked terminal is opened. In this case, RemoteDesktop doesn't work, as it only works for Windows.
 Questions:- How can I solve this problem? I can imagine there are softwares like RemoteDesktop that allows you to connect to a Linux server? Or there are some settings in Putty that avoid the opened window to be frozen? (or maybe is some corporate policy?)
 - How can I open another terminal and connect to the server with the CLI using the existing SSH tunnel?

Throughout my career I've had great culture in my remote workplace - My team always said good morning, communicated throughout the day to overcome roadblocks, sent memes, and let folks know when they logged out for the evening. It truly felt like being part of a unit who tried to accomplish a common goal. But at this new job, there's no casual chatter whatsoever - I just clock in on the time system, do my work, and only message people if absolutely necessary. Is this normal? I imagine some folks will see this as ideal but it's quite a culture shock to me and it's been difficult to get my bearings without a "buddy" to answer questions.
 I haven't even met the guys on my team so I scheduled 1:1s with everyone under my boss's umbrella just to make my face known, and most of them mentioned that it was unusual and no one had done that before.
 Should I just let go of the culture I'm comfortable with and learn to appreciate the solitude? Any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings
 I'm reverse-engineering a working but neglected network with just enough networking knowledge to get myself in trouble.
 We have about 15 VLANS defined on the switch, only a few of them are actively in use.
 There are two entries on our core switch (Cisco Catalyst 4500e) in the running config that I'm trying to figure out.
 access-list 100 deny ip any 10.1.30.0 0.0.0.255
 access-list 100 permit ip any any
 The thing that's throwing me off is that 10.1.30.0/24 is our main production VLAN and there's a ton of that traffic running through this switch.
 I'm clearly interpreting the rule incorrectly because it seems to read, "block all IP traffic from 10.1.30.0/24" but clearly that traffic is flowing through just fine.
 The second rule seems to be a catch-all, "LET IT ALL THROUGH!" rule... is that typical? Best practice?
 As I said, everything works as expected, but the network is due for an overhaul so I'm trying to get things documented "as-is" and these two entries are throwing me off a bit.
 Thanks!

 We have a private line to one of our sister companies to exchange data, this line has recently changed and therefore, so has the IP
 We currently route via static routes on both our host servers and our guest VMs direct to the router interface IP
 This time however, we’re going via a firewall which handles the routing - there is a slight issue however, our DG has a route applied for the current config but some jackass lost the password (I’ve very recently taken over).
 So currently I’m routing DHCP and servers directly to the firewall which then handles the routing, great - this works fine and we can now see our sister company and reach their network
 However, there is an issue coming back, they can not see us - they reach the router and then the packet drops, I was not aware of anything that would need to be setup ourside to route their traffic internally? It doesn’t look like this is currently setup (I’m not a network engineer).
 If we can reach them, why wouldn’t they be able to reach us? I currently have a firewall configured to route traffic to them, and our guest VMs also are setup to route to them, the hosts currently are not but I don’t see how this would cause an issue? Could it be something to do with the route applied on the DG? But again, we can get to them OK?
 Would appreciate any advice on where to start looking…
 Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company was acquired recently, and the new CEO that has taken over has been changing a lot of processes and personnel. 
 One of the first things he requested when he took over as CEO was a "Windows 7 laptop". At first I thought I misread it, but nope. I asked for clarification because I assumed it had to have been a mistake. To my horror, it was not. He specifically stated that he's been using windows 7 since its inception and that it's the last enterprise worthy OS release from Microsoft, and that he believes windows 10 is more about advertising and selling user data than being an enterprise/business oriented OS offering. 
 He claims he came from the security sector and that they were able to accommodate him at his last job with a Windows 7 machine, and that that place "was like fort Knox", and that with a good anti virus and zero trust/least privilege there should be no concern using it over windows 10. 
 At first I didn't know what to think.. I began downloading windows 7 updates in WSUS to accommodate the request. Then I thought about it more, and I think it's a lose lose for me. If I don't accommodate, I'm ruffling the feathers of the new CEO and could be replaced as a result. If I do, and it causes some sort of security breach, my job is on the line. I started to wonder if this odd request was for the sole purpose of having a reason to get rid of me? How would you handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm fairly new in the enterprise routing switching and cloud area as I just moved up from mostly loadbalancing, monitoring and ISE and we recently lost one of our last remaining primary route/switch guys. But I'm working on connecting a recent circuit we acquired for Azure express route through an ISP thats using Megaport to peer up with our Azure tenant.
 There's still some foggy design once I get the actual circuit portion connected in but I'm thinking of pathing it in to a couple of ASRs in our DC as the BGP peering between our Primary DC and the Azure Expressroute circuit.
 I've got a design picture from the ISP showing a single switch (we have this in our DC right now) connecting to one of our cisco switches using a Q-in-Q trunk, then after that it's basically up to us for the routing and potentially firewall side of things.
 My question to them was trying to ask if I need to be aware of their C-tags on our end, or if I just setup a single q-in-q trunk to our switch and tag our own vlans and somehow work with that after the fact.
 They only replied to me with info on the 2 CTags (308, 307), one for primary and one for secondary as Expressroute seems to setup a couple BGP sessions as built in redundancy, so I'm a bit confused on how to differentiate, or setup the layer 2 config, for the primary and secondary use case on our end with only the 1 physical connection from the ISP.
 Has anyone ever worked on such a setup before with express route like this? I know I'm a bit in over my head but nobody else here has any more answers than I do as most of us are quite green on the team.

Today out of nowhere the latency on that voice SSID has gone through the roof, average of 800ms+ while the clients on the other SSID's are experiencing normal latency. Happening on both controllers. Have looked at switch ports, no errors, bandwidth usage is typical, system numbers for the controllers are all normal and one would think if there were any problems with the controllers or network it would affect all the SSID's.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Problem 1 - So the environment has about ~1000 computers. We had maybe half of the computers have uptime over 7 days, and a third over 14 days. 
 Problem 1 fix - I created a task a couple of years ago in PDQ, but have moved to Ninja, to create pop-ups using the msg.exe stating your computer's uptime is more than X days! Please reboot.
 Problem 2 - Now we only have about 30-50 computers that have over 18 days uptime. 
 Opinion - I think the best course of action would be to force shut down the computer after 4 days (4 days for the reason of the weekend, month end, payroll, etc...) and have a pop-up counter every now and then showing it's going to happen. I was going to run a shutdown /s /t 345600, but I'm unsure how to make a pop-up with the date or time of the force reboot. It does do a pop up when executed and when there are I think 5 or 2 minutes left. I could make a different pop-up at noon, for people at 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, and 22 days, with a comment of the reboot will happen in X days at noon (X hours) and possibly -a the previous shutdown command. 
 Why? - We have seen a large reduction in tickets from these pop-ups, and fewer complaints about stuff being slow. However the 80/20 rule of 20% of your users will create 80% of the problems, and of course, those 20% refuse to reboot their computers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I was wondering what SMTP service people are using as I am scouting for alternatives. 
 We are currently using Sendgrid SaaS through Azure and relay mails through a hosted SMTP server to Sendgrid. This is mostly because most of the printers we use do not support passwords longer than 64 characters so the sendgrid API key wont work. We use IP whitelisting instead of authentication ( not the best solution i know)
  
 However, we are growing and more services are using the Sendgrid tenant. Some systems that use this have supporters that would like access to check the mail logs for these services, however, since all the domains are in the same service, and there is no way of restricting ther access to certain domains ( as far as i know) it is starting to become a pain in the ass.
 Thought about setting up a seperate SendGrid for these services, but then DKIM and DMARC will be acting up.
  
 What is everyone else using and what can you recommend?
 Basically looking for something that supports basic auth or ip whitelisting for printers, or relay from SMTP and where we can delegate access based on domain and/or service.

 Is there an approach to learig etwork automation 'on the go' as I go about my daily work and I do it in between slow times?
 My idea so far is that I install ansible on my windows work laptop and just try running a few commands on our lab equipment. And from there as I get more confident maybe go on to more elaborate stuff.

 Does anyone know if there is much in the way of support for this from device vendors? Cos I assume it will have to be supported at both the device and server end for it to work.
 I can't find any mention of support for it on one of my biggest hitter device types, so I'm not very hopeful :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I come from a simple time where you get a ticket , you solve it and the customer is happy.
 10 years ago we had a team of 20 db/vmware/linux/windows admins that did only that and life was good.
 Customers and work load kept increasing, yet due to automatization we managed to solve everything.
 Now that team is 10 persons strong and the gain of automatization is dwindling. So we ask for extra hires. -> denied no budget.
 Yet in these same 10 years the following "positions" have been created.
 Project manager ( in the past the sysadmin did this) Service delivery manager Service level manger Service assitance manager Escalation manager Customer account manager Customer succes manager ....
 I'm not saying these functions are useless but this cuts into our profit and our budget for new hires. Also these positions add to the workload of the sysadmin because they can't do nothing on there own.
 So now it's Get a ticket Realise you cannot solve this quicly and need more time to investigate ( 10 years ago you just had time) Write a report to service level manger why you need more time. Inform escalation Write escalation report ...
 It almost looks like I need to write reports explaining why we cannot solve something instead of just solving it.
 And you know the worst part. The customer themselves also have these BS positions and they are happy with all those reports.
 It almost looks like a symbiosis of our positions keeping the customer positions alive and vice versa.

 I have many fileserver with deduplication activated and I'm considering to activate Azure File Sync and implement cache servers to reduce local footprint. As i understand, Azure File Sync is compatible with data deduplication, but it doesn't process files in /system volume information https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/storage/file-sync/file-sync-planning.md
 So, if i want to implement cache servers, they will have to be minimum the size of the actual "/system volume information"; is this correct?
 What are the benefit if i can move to Azure File Sync only the stub files?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seen a few posts on here about being dropped in at the deep end so thought I'd share my experience of this.
 My first role in IT support, I was part of a 2 person IT department for a small college, just me and the IT Manager. My Manager was very knowledgeable and taught me a lot about the general day to day of doing support.
 After about 9 months, the Manager went on sick leave, which was fine at first as there had been times where I was on my own for the day to cover annual leave/weekends etc. After a week of him being on sick leave and completely out of communication I was starting to get concerned as even though I was handling my day to day tasks, I was starting to get more questions that I had no idea about, and would usually pass up to the Manager. I had to very quickly learn how to manage all of the IT requirements for the college, updating business critical software, dealing with suppliers, deciding on purchases, managing the IT budget etc. 
 The Manager never came back from his sick leave, I only saw him 1 more time about a year later when he came in to collect some stuff. I ended up being a 1 person IT department for 9 years and was very comfortable doing that role. The only reason I left is because the college merged with another larger college and I would have had to become a smaller role in a 6 person IT department, which felt like a step backwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I took an opportunity to get some basically free server hosting at a friends work place since they’ve got a bunch of unused public IPs. I’ve already bought the hardware, being two servers, and I want some advise on what I’ve chosen to do and if anyone has a different way that might be better for management specifically.
 So first things first, I got a 1u R620 that I plan to install pfsense onto and have it route 3 different incoming wans into 3 different places. One will be a private network with full firewall and all, another will be a similar one but will specifically run a few servers that are ported out through the firewall. And the last one is going to hold my email server (I’ve got rdns and ip configs in place)
 Both of the “public” networks will be routed to a single server, R720 running proxmox(because I like it) and will be internally routed to the vms it needs to go on. My next no open ports network, is going to be my management network I guess, specifically so I can configure the pfsense when needed without exposing the webui of it to any other server. I’m thinking a little Dell optiplex running Ubuntu server and something j can connect to it with. I plan to have some sort of vpn set up so I can vpn in and talk to that management network.
 I know this sounds not the best and messy, hence why I’m here. It’s the best I could come up with in a few nights. Some guidance would be nice to see what other people recommend for this. I’m looking for advise on more of the networking side and how to more efficiently implement this setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m very curious about how/if network automation is done at your company.
 I’m a year out of school, and I first learned about the network automation trend then. I then did a deep dive on the common Python libraries (Netmiko/Nornir/Napalm) and Ansible.
 I now work at a big bank and realize writing one-off scripts to do configuration management/config checking doesn’t cut it, because while running a script at the CLI works, it’s not consumable for a wider audience.
 My opinion is that building web applications that serve a network automation purpose is the ideal way to do it, but the time investment to learn web development is really big.
 So my questions are what are the use cases of network automation, what is the size of your company, and do scripts serve your needs or have you needed to build web applications that are shareable/usable by a wider audience.
 I have my Devnet associate and I am fairly adept at scripting, but when I see people like John Capobianco and Devnet Dan combining web development with network automation, I feel like I can’t even say I’m in the network automation space.
 Sure, I can commit my time to learning a bit of web development, but with so many vendor and open source tools dedicated to network automation, I don’t want to commit to something that may not have a big payoff.

 So we have our DB (AWS Aurora) and app (AWS) in private subnets. DB is only accessed through the app or our Redash.
 Recently, during a security meeting, it came up that how we detect data leaks or breaches.
 Currently, the only way we can detect a security risk is by Cloudtrail logs, which logs who accessed the DB credentials (from Secrets Manager). There are only 2 DB users: app user and redash user (read only). 
 How do you guys secure and monitor DB breaches or leaks? Any tools?
 Thank you.

However, the return traffic is being blocked by our ASA Firewall with the error message "Deny tcp reverse path check." The reason behind this is the pre-existing VTI tunnel and static route for this customer's public IP range.
 To segregate this traffic, what would the best approach? Adding a more specific route for the Internet traffic for this customer ?

 Title is pretty much the question. Assuming the device is still in warranty is anyone moving to a 4 year cycle from 3?
 It just doesn't seem like the upgrade every 3 years actually provides much benefit. CPU improvements really seem to be quite small, and everyone already has 16GB of Memory. Feels like there is better things I could be doing with the budget that frees up.

 I'm planning on setting up a toolkit to bring with me to help avoid making unnecessary trips to pick up tools and odds and ends when troubleshooting and servicing devices.
 I'm thinking I'll need the following; - Macbook Air, provisioned by my workplace - iPhone, provisioned by my workplace - USB-C Hub - HDMI and DisplayPort cables - Medicat and Ventoy USB sticks - Mini Leatherman - Screwdriver set - Keyboard and Mouse
 I'm wondering if other folks here have experience working in a similar situation; and have any advice on other things I should keep for support purposes. Likewise any tips and advice for working on a large campus that you regularly cross.

All of my team is busy with our lives on the weekend, nor do i expect them to work on the weekend, especially on something out of our scope. I am probably going to have to end up biting the bullet and do it myself. I want to charge enough where they think twice about really having to need IT on site just to log into Zoom, but not so much as to seem vindictive. What would that rate be in your area?

 So the scenario is 40% percent of our boxes (4 appliances) are or will be eol soon. Unfortunately that includes the master. In order to not have to change the dhcp/ntp/dns settings on a slew of devices, we'll have to re-ip the candidate box. I've documented all the boxes involved: where they're connected, vlans, IP addresses. That's how far I've gone. The new boxes are already in prod by the way. Let's just say the guy who was the admin for this has left abruptly, mid-deployment
 The part I'm not too familiar with is the backend. What will I need; configs, dns, etc that will make this transition as smooth as possible?

We are waiting on the manufacturer to upgrade the system but they are taking a while to develop software to work on anything else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for an MSP and one of our clients is facing an obnoxious issue. If I run a continuous ping from any device on the LAN to anything on the WAN, at random points throughout the day, it will just time out. The Time outs may happen once every so often or may be as dramatic as cutting in and out like crazy for several minutes Users are noticing the outages and having trouble loading web apps for work. The only thing that is consistent is that all the devices on the LAN are facing the issue. The Gateway is a SonicWall, and no devices ever have trouble pinging it. The issues occur pinging the outside world. I am confident that it is an ISP issue with ether a faulty connection outside the facility or hardware issue however I want to rule out anything I can on my LAN to make sure nothing is eating the bandwidth of the connection or something else I am not thinking of.
 TLDR: Want to make sure I have all my bases covered on network outages for MSP client.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[City: Vancouver Canada.
 I was looking at jobs on LinkedIn recently, and saw IT Analyst positions requiring at least 5 years of experience. What were they paying? $55-70k CAD. This is $40k-55k USD BEFORE tax. Tax in Canada is very high.
 Rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in this city is about 2000 CAD. If you were making a wage like this, you'd barely have any savings after expenses.
 It used to be that working IT gave you a comfortable wage - for companies to openly advertise these kind of wages is absolutely brutal. They must be doing this because so many candidates would reject them purely on this. Which brings me to the next point: people that knowingly apply for these roles are desperate and being taken advantage of. I would say don't get taken advantage of but when you are desperate....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working with a healthcare-related entity in need of a cloud-based VPN solution. The main purpose is to provide secure access to a web-based SaaS application. Specifically, we require a VPN that offers static IP addresses for all users to comply with the SaaS provider's IP whitelist requirements.
 Moreover, we need the VPN client to support split-tunneling to allow local network devices and resources to be accessed when necessary. It would be ideal if split-tunneling could be achieved using FQDNs rather than just IPs.
 Our total user count will be around 50, and as a cloud-based company, we do not have any on-premises equipment. Our users are distributed, working from either their homes or shared office spaces.
 So far I've looked at:
  
Cloudflare: It looks like a promising option, especially with the freemium plan that suits our user count. I would love to hear your opinions on this.
 ZScaler: I'm in the process of scheduling a call with their sales representative to get more information.
 Netmaker: This option is based on WireGuard and seems promising, but I'm keen to know if any of you have experience using it.
  Palo Alto Prisma Access: While it fits our needs, the minimum requirement of 200 user licenses might be cost-prohibitive for us.
 Palo Alto VM-series firewall in Azure: Unfortunately, I don't have a frame of reference on Azure costs, so any insights would be helpful.
 NordVPN: Not a suitable option as it does not support split-tunneling, as confirmed by their representative.
  Perimeter81: I'm not familiar with this company, but it was referred to me by NordVPN.
  
Are there any other good VPN providers out there?

 Our Cisco router has:
 router bgp XXXXX
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 redistribute connected
 neighbor E.F.G.H remote-as YYYY
 neighbor E.F.G.H route-map localonly out
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
 ip address A.B.C.1 255.255.255.0 
 Our Palo Alto firewall WAN interface to public internet is configured with IP/CIDR as A.B.C.2/24 and it has a default route via A.B.C.1.
 We now want to set up an AWS Direct Connection using A.B.C.254/31 (.254 on our firewall and .255 on the AWS router). We are using the private ASN 64512.
 Instructions from Amazon have us configuring an interface on the firewall (actually a subinterface with VLAN tagging) using the A.B.C.254/31 address before setting up BGP.
 However, the firewall does not allow this since the new interface has an overlapping subnet with the WAN interface.
 What's the best thing to do here?
 1. I am thinking we would change the netmask on the Cisco router to 255.255.255.128 and change the firewall WAN link to /25. Yes?
 2. But then we're only advertising addresses .1-128 to the Internet, and .254-.255 to AWS. What would be the best way to tell the firewall and router to keep using .129-253 for our public WAN link?

Recently we've been forced to move some users to Windows 11 Pro and since day one they have been having trouble connecting to the Remote Desktop Services server or standard remote desktop sessions. They'll randomly throw a message saying: 
 "Because of an error in data encryption, this session will end. Please try connecting to the remote computer again."
 The Windows 11 PC and the Server 2012 R2 servers have been fully patched and all Windows updates installed. 
 The most recently attempt was to start the Link-Layer Topology Discovery Mapper service which was set to manual, but that did not help.
 Any suggestions?

 With that said, we have a team that has built a Grafana dashboard for some metrics and telemetry data for non-network gear within our footprint. I was thinking of getting assistance from him to help build one for the network. I just don't know what's supported, so for those that have done this already, what information do you have on there?
 I figure device uptime, maybe bandwidth statistics for our core, some interface statistics. Anything else that would be helpful and relevant? I understand it could differ from network to network, but just trying to get a feel overall of what you all use for your dashboard.
 Any info would be appreciated. Thank you.

 I can download the .tar and extract it, but that's about as far as I can get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So long story short we had a "pentest" by our cyber insurance company which seems like they just did a basic port scan. 
 ​
 They are highly concerned to the point where they may not give us coverage because of this:
 ​
 They found port 443 open on our Cisco router for our VPN. They can go to the external IP and it resolves to a cisco page (X.X.X.X/+CSCOE+/logon.html). If you have credentials for that portal, you can download the Cisco Anyconnect client. I went to an external network and tried it. I couldn't find any other functionality to that page other than the client download. 
 ​
 All of this stuff was set up long before my time at the company, but is this not standard? From my understanding the router portal is a feature that was put there on purpose. 
 ​
 They are really insisting that we shut down access to port 443. I am really insisting that closing that port would render our VPN services non-existent. 
 Are they being idiots? Am I being an idiot? Are we all being idiots? VPNs and routers are NOT my strong suit so I'm worried I'm missing something obvious. 
 Should I stand my ground that this guy who did the port scan doesn't understand VPNs?

Despite several reports to proofpoint with permalinks to the offending emails and a description of the problem they are still coming and I had to block that domain, but it will only stop them until they change to another domain. I am also filtering for the phrase "Please Protect your account" the subjects so far have been userfirstname.userlastname, Please Protect your account, with the same thing showing up as the first line in the email
 I have saved the .eml files for several dozen of these emails and sent them to Amazon EC2 abuse and they have been extremely unhelpful. You would think they would want to stop these assholes as it is making them look bad for allowing it to happen. I am to the point of just blocking all emails coming from any amazon aws or ec2 site.
 If I block .png attachments it will probably mess up email signatures that use png files.
 It is getting annoying, as these emails sail right through Microsoft's defender phishing detection and through proofpoint since they are using a png file to try to trick people into falling for the phish.

 Posting here as I was encouraged by you all last time. 
 The foster care charity I am a volunteer at (I work with/support Foster Dads) has asked if I would be able to help try to find laptops again for foster kids going back to school. My company marketing department helped me make a flyer and post on LinkedIn to try to collect any decommissioned machines from anyone. I kept it pretty brief for LinkedIn sake, but if anyone does have some laptops, they'd be happy to donate to get repurposed for foster Kids in the Denver area, I would gladly take them and send you a tax write off letter for your trouble. 
 Linkedin Post: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090341579864903680/
 FAQ (for IT people): 
  
Yes, we are happy to take laptops without hard drives. 
 We cannot take desktops as foster kids move around a lot and this makes it hard for them to transport, but I can connect you with a charity that does if you'd like.

I will be honest and say that I have never been able to truly become "great" at managing or making optimizations to any of these platforms as I am pulled in so many directions daily beyond what I have listed that I want to pull my hair out sometimes.

However, I'm trying to find some way to view just a list of all articles created by a specific user. I haven't been able to find anything searching Google, so I thought I'd ask here.
 My first thought was to just check the user's entry in the portal, but no luck. Then I tried to create a report to pull it. Creation DATE is a searchable option, but not created BY.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am a network admin, but I am lost when it comes to undertstanding certificates. I get what they are. They verify the website you are connecting to is legit and all that. Can't tell you much more about how they work, but I have that.
 We are currently setting up a captive portal for our new wireless using aruba clearpass. We are having issues getting it working and from my understanding it has something to do the cert. We can reach the captive portal and register, but after that, we get a blank page.
 What does a certificate have to do with this, considering its an inside hosted page we are reaching? Why will it not work without a certificate? And on top of that, why does it have to be a a legit purchases cert, and not a self signed or self generated one?

 I'd like to carve off a hunk for work only, isolated/sandboxed, AzureAD joined, with tighter controls, hardened, etc. 
 90% of what I do is live in a browser for work, with some remote access (RDP, win32 based remote control app, PuTTY, that's about it) and obviously Office 365 (Outlook, OneDrive, Teams)
 My first thought was Windows 11 Sandbox, but persistence would be an issue, although I could probably spin up an image that's preloaded; I'm not sure if that's supported.
 There is obviously Hyper-V, but I'm not sure how well it would perform for webcam pass-thru, general video performance, etc.
 Figured I'd ask before reinventing the wheel...

More specifically it performs a DNS (Domain Name System) query for a SRV (Service) record. It will then make a connection to the domain controller. If this is all successful, the domain profile is set..
  
It says it will make a connection to “the” domain controller. What if that specific domain controller is offline, inaccessible, rebooting etc. at that exact moment? It will assign the network as a Public and set the windows Firewall to the Public Network profile.
 How often will it retry again and will it keep trying the same DC host from its local DNS cache or will it do a new query getting the same DC over and over from the SRV lookup or should it get different DC entry from the SRV record with each new query?

 Many start-ups and large companies hold sales of their products and give discounts. I searched the internet and found a few such offers, which might be useful to someone:
 Linux Foundation offers 50% on bootcamps, training courses and certifications. 
 Getscreen.me remote desktop give 25% discount on first subscription. 
 PrinterLogic is giving away free t-shirts for sysadmins.
 Cafepress presents gifts for sysadmins (you can finally buy a new mug!:-))
 Lot of funny sysadmin stickers on Redbubble
 That's all I've been able to find on the internet so far. It's strange, in previous years there were many more such offers (please comment if you know of any other discounts or freebies.

The script runs all the way to the end but when I try to put my test user on hold I get the error: "Creating the hold named newhold. Please wait...WARNING: An unexpected error has occurred and a Watson dump is being generated: The value is set to emptyParameter name: locationWARNING: Task module "ReportExceptionModule.ReportException" fails with exception "Access to the path 'C:\ExchangeSetupLogs\ExchangeSetupWatson.log' is denied.".

 Can someone else test this to see if the script is faulty or if it just something on my end? Its very odd that its throwing empty value codes at me as it prompts you for input along the way and they have all been satisfied. The sanity check would really help.

 AFAIK - FIDO2 keys are not an option along with OATH hardware tokens - Microsoft doesn't support that for guest accounts. 
 Maybe software tokens? What do you think?

 The only method of ensuring this looks to be to force Edge sign-in. This would be acceptable if edge didn't crash as soon as you enable the account filter GPO to only allow logins to *@contoso.com.

 for some time now i have a problem with our NetDrives for users connected via VPN. The users get the following error message:
 "Microsoft Windows Network: The local device name is already in use. This connection has not been restored."
 The mapped drives are shares on a Windows Server 2022 and are connected to the clients via GPO. The users connect to our company network with the Watchguard SSL Client. The drives work without any problems for everyone inside our company network, but not when connected via VPN. When i try to connect to the Server manually it works just fine. At the moment i gave the users a script, which removes all NetDrives and connects them again. The wierd thing is it works sometimes for some users, what makes me think its some kind of DNS error. I would appreciate every tip i can get, thanks.

 We have an infrastructure of around 800 switches.
 For better control, I recently set up a netdisco server. Everything works fine except one point. Ours routers (Nexus nx-os series 9k) do not generate the lldp cards with ours switches (procurve, aoscx, h3c).
 We asked for help on the netdisco forum, had good answers activated the cdp at their request but nothing worked.
 Yet when we do a "show lldp neighbors" on the router directly, everything looks good.
 Has anyone already encountered the problem?
 Thanks in advance
 PS: sorry for my english,

 Connecting out to a 3rd party provider via an nginx proxy, they very kindly changed the IP address behind their URL without telling us. Nginx never updated the resolution and we had to reload config on the proxy servers to force an update.
 Easy fix in the end but a nightmare to get there. Documentation will be updated.

 With that, looking to buy a laserjet that does color, duplex, wired (don't want to deal with wifi dying eventually or losing its mind) and or usb. Photocopy would be ideal. Don't need scanning...
 Use is for home business for recipes, labels and home school photocopying. Ideally a limit of $500 or less. I don't mind buying older printers on ebay or the like if they are solid models.

Now I'm in a new spot that uses Box for cloud file storage (which is GREAT as a sharepoint replacment but garbage as a OneDrive replacement). 
 Has anyone successfully used Box AND OneDrive? I'm thinking of using Box for cloud file storage and collab but silently turning on OneDrive with KFM solely to automatically back up documents/desktop/pictures. We are an E3 shop, so we have OneDrive already, the sync client has just been disabled via dism during task sequence (don't ask). So essentially OneDrive is there, but only in the cloud. 
 Unfortunately, I don't have the option to move the org OFF of Box. I'm trying to simplify refreshing PCs where now the techs are "manually backing up user data from a C drive" to a temporary file share, then manually copying it back down on the new PC (like it's 1999 LOL) 
 Anyone have any experience with both?

After an entire year of unemployment due to being laid off from my previous job because of downsizing, I finally received a job offer from a new company. Initially, it felt like a glimmer of hope amidst the struggles, nightmares, and exhausting ordeal of the recruiting process.
 However, my excitement turned to severe disappointment when I realized I had fallen victim to a bait-and-switch situation. Throughout the hiring process, the recruiter assured me that the job was fully remote, which was crucial for me. But at the final stages of the interview, they dropped the bombshell that it's an onsite job, and I could only negotiate remote work after three months.
 I feel utterly lied to and betrayed, especially after enduring countless rejections and navigating the recruiting hell. It's frustrating to finally receive an offer, only to discover that it's not what was promised.
 This deceit has left me feeling so angry that it triggered a migraine, and it's taken all my strength to write this post seeking your advice and assistance. I don't know what to do next. I'm desperate for some guidance as I navigate this challenging decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dipping my toes into some EXOS networking in GNS3, in preparation for some new Extreme Networks kit arriving for my organisation. My VAR is doing the driving on implementation but I'm trying to familiarise/learn myself hence the (probably easy) question.
 In my lab, this is my current setup. The two core switches are MLAG'd together w/ VRRP for core redundancy, that's fine and works great.
 For the edge/access setup, I have two /30 interconnecting VLANs with OSPF interface enabled as P2P. On our current network, this is how we do it with RIP. I then have two default routes, one pointing to the core's SVI on each link for redundancy. It works, but it's slow(ish) to rebuild OSPF routes when one of the links go down.
 An option I had in mind was potentially setting up a VRRP in a /29 for the SVI's and then MLAG'ing the ports on the core, with a static route on the edge to the VRRP address - but it feels like I'm reinventing the wheel somewhat and overcomplicating.
 If you were setting up a new edge/access in your network, how would you do the redundancy which offers the best speed and convergence time?
 Any help/guidance would be much appreciated, thanks. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 We are running a 50 employee company and want a VPN solution for travel, allowing for better security on public and hotel wifis.
  
Computers: all Win10 22H2, soon starting W11 upgrade
 On-prem: A office network only, that is barely used (employees are rarly working from office)
 No datacenter or servers
 Microsoft 365 with email, sharepoint, onedrive and the usual
 Some other cloud services too, such as invoicing and time tracking
  
Is configuring a point-to-site VPN i Azure might be overkill and more expensive than necessary?
 If possible, I'd like to avoid purchasing 50 [insert (shady) VENDORNAME] VPN solution licences and deploying those manually.
 Right now, we are instructing our employees to use 4/5G mobile data, and not connect to those public and hotel Wifi networks. This works fine in Europe, but for travels outside the EU, the economics breaks the solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've noticed this strange issue a few times over the last couple months. When my users send an email with an attachment internally, Message Trace shows that it grows by roughly 5%, I assume due to encoding and headers. However, when sending outside the org, the growth is more like 50%.
 I've had users send emails to external orgs with an attachment that's ~28MB in size. But by the time it leaves Exchange servers, Message Trace shows that it's sitting at ~38MB. This is above the default size limit of 35, so the messages are then rejected by recipients (and the icing on the cake, the sender doesn't get a bounce back).
 Has anyone else suffered this issue and found solutions or information as to what's going on?

He went into work and an hour later was told and locked out of the offices etc. Now, my friend was the sole point of contact for MFA for all the company's clients admin accounts in various portals/admin centres,, be it via authenticator app or mobile number and we were discussing what happens now if he is contacted regarding access to clients. 
 He's saying if contacted he will pass on the info at a charge ad he doesn't work for free. I think he will have to just pass them on or face a legal challenge or withholdal of redundancy pay or potentially Microsoft will unlock the accounts based on the company closing. 
 Anyone had this scenario play out?

One PC is DP only and the other just has mini HDMI connectors. This company has a drawer full of video adapter cables and I still didn't have what I needed. I kinda miss when everything was just VGA and you didn't have to go hunting for adapters every time you want to plug a PC into a monitor. I'm sure there are advantages to all these new connectors, but simplicity ain't one of them.

 My boss is thinking to move all of our equipment to a Data Center due to costs. In this case we would need to purchase a new STX as our data center gateway. After digging around, I've started to wonder who does organisations connect their campus l2 network with the Data Center one.
 I am familiarised with MPLS VPLS, VPN-2-VPN or even VXLAN. We are not thinking of using MPLS as it would include ISP costs, so in this case what is the best way to connect our users, iot devices, cameras and smart devices which they are on their own vlan on campus to the servers on the data center? I am trying to avoid l3 connectivity between both, although the underlay network is l3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was hired last year to be the principal engineer over a local on prem env along with cloud engineer duties. The on prem really is a simple env and doesn't take much time but internal Infra does fall under it. They needed a dedicated person to "run point". 
 We have an MSP they've used for years and they are really good most of the time. Their head engineer passed away. He was who I worked with most.
 My boss and the CTO want to roll out Intune since we're 365 and our licenses are right. 
 I'm in the very early stages of building policies and testing them. They want the initial policies simple and aimed at mobile devices. So IOS and Android.
 I created an Android policy, tested it on my phone, and made notes.
 I went to create a Conditional Access Policy and didn't have the rights. So I reached out to ask for them. 
 The engineer called me and made me second guess myself. He wanted to knkw why I needed a conditional access policy and not just a device policy.
 And I still don't understand the question or logic behind it. Because if I create Device Policies but not Conditional Access Policy - there would be nothing in place to force people to enroll their devices. The device policies would be pointless.
 Maybe he didn't understand I was testing. But I said the word testing multiple times.
 Am I nuts? I need a Conditional access Polocy or it's all moot, correct?
 If I want to not allow users to be able to use say 365 apps on their phone unless their device is enrolled and compliant - I need a conditional access policy forcing them to enroll their device.
 I think I'm just fried for the day and need to take off early and reset. Because this seems like a no brainer to me.

I was able to learn a lot within that year, but after he left the company, I felt like I started to stagnate. The management was also god-awful, and wanted to get out ASAP. 
 I left the company earlier this year and got a job as desktop support that pays me almost double what I was making at the old place. I feel I'm making much more than what is typical for this kind of position, especially considering I'm doing far less than I was at my previous job. 
 I'm happy about getting a livable wage, but it feels like I'm hurting myself more in the long run by taking the de facto "demotion". Nothing I've done in the past month or so of being here is something I couldn't teach my mom how to do in a few hours. 
 Any thoughts regarding this? 
 TL;DR: I'm making more money, but feel like I'm wasting time not increasing the value of my resume.

I'm not necessarily talking about just for one system, because that can be put in the systems documentation. I'm referring to like, bigger issues related to ALL HP printers with a certain firmware / model, or maybe a new Windows bug like AppReadiness slowing logins. It doesn't affect everyone but maybe it should be noted somewhere in case someone runs into this issue or maybe it should be posted because it needs someone to keep an eye on it, like in the case of a 'laravel.log' growing to be way to big, which might require someone to manually move that file(s) elsewhere.
 Just wondering. We don't have a place for 'just so you're aware' and I don't know what to do with some info that might be useful to some other techs. Think like a bulletin board with notes or papers on it with information

As much as I despise the app (as compared to other wikis), I like the idea of one company-wide IT central point of knowledge. We're a large Enterprise IT shop and there are lots of teams I need to interact with, each with their own procedures and methods of engagement. With each one having their own Confluence space, I now go to one place to search for documentation.
 But no one seems to understand the concept of a wiki. In a wiki you LINK TO OTHER PAGES. So, when you're trying to document the process you go to to build a new Azure VM, you should link to the Azure provisioning team, and not create your own documentation. Cause whatever you have might be out of date very quickly.
 So, now I go to Confluence and search "provision Azure SLES VM" and I get 20 different pages that come up, some defining of procedure that went out of date 2 YEARS AGO.
 I went through my teams Wiki and removed any documentation that didn't involve something my team does, and replaced it with links to documentation from the team that does that work. And everyone got mad at me.
 I give up.

 The switch has a few VLANS and those VLANS have SVIs acting as default gateways for clients in those VLANS. There is also a routed port on the Cisco switch that is connected directly to another layer 3 switch. 
 For reference the routed port on the Cisco switch is 10.17.6.252. The IP of the port it’s connecting to on the other layer 3 switch is 10.17.6.253. The Cisco switch can ping .253. 
 All the clients off of the VLAN SVIs are able to ping the routed port on the Cisco .252 but are unable to reach .253. I am needing clients in the VLANS to be able to reach .253. 
 I have set up static routes…
 ip route 10.17.6.253 255.255.255.255 Gi1/0/9 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.17.6.253
 Gi1/0/9 is the routed port on the Cisco that’s directly connected to the .253 port on the other layer 3 switch. 
 Is there something simple I am missing? I am not understanding why .253 is reachable from the switch itself, but not from any clients connected to the switch. Did I mess up my routes or is there something else? 
 Thanks for any help you can offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Today is the second time this happens to me and I am not really sure why.
 We had a remote device connected to our core network that went down due an electrical issue. When that issue was solved, we could see the interfaces became up but there was still no IP connectivity between the remote router and core router, no ping between them and, consequently, no BGP session. 
 I tried resetting the BGP, doing shut/no shut to port at core end but the issue was remaining. 
 We have CDP disable due internal policies, but I enabled it to see if the devices were seeing each other at L2 and, suddenly, connectivity was recovered and BGP session became up. 
 I guess when I enabled CDP, traffic was generated through the interface and remote MAC learnt (I did not check MAC address table prior enabling CDP), but I don't really know why it needed to generate traffic to learn it.
 The other thing I could see during the issue was BGP state toggling between Active and Idle. 
 This is the second time something similar happens to me, the other time was during a migration from an old core router to a newer one, when connected to the new core there was no IP connectivity until CDP was enable.
 Does anyone have an idea of what could be the reason I needed to enable CDP to provide IP connectivity between the devices? 
 Thanks in advance for reading.

 This setup stays for around 3 days. The strange thing is that sometimes, not really regularly, the switches tend to either don’t get link from the previous one, or loose the link to the next one. My quick solution is to restart the switches which always works. But it’s annoying because sometimes it’s more of them so my daily morning routine often is to go to all of them and restart them. 
 My question now is, what can cause this? I know 6 switches in a row is a nono but there is no way around. It sadly has to be like this. Can it be the switches caching too much data or what could it be? 
 Thanks for the help if someone can help and have a nice day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’ve run into a problem and I’ll try to be brief.
 The company I work for has a HA firewall setup and has two ISP with a main ISP (router A) and a secondary ISP (router B)
 I was doing a fail over test yesterday and it did not fail over properly to router B. There was no internet. So I started troubleshooting.
 I plugged a laptop up the the secondary firewall and still nothing. I plug the laptop into router B directly and it was working with no issue, mind you DHCP is on. I ran tracert to see if I am getting out and I am. 
 I look on ip chicken to grab my ip and this is where I’m confused. While still plugged into router B, My public ip is the same as the gateway address my ISP has given me.
 At this point I try to put the information from my ISP as static, when I do that it seems like it works for a bit then it just stops working. I swap to DHCP and it start working again.
 I’ve contacted my ISP and they were no help telling me everything I already knew. Such as what my ip, gateway address and subnet is.
 Supposedly per the ISP our ip is 54.82.137.233 and our gateway is 54.82.137.234 (obviously this is not ours but it follows the same template, they are both public) and our subnet is 255.255.255.252
 I’ve contacted our fire wall team and once again has confirmed our gate way is 54.82.137.234 but it’s also the public. Last resort I was going to get them to rebuild the interface but I’m still so confused on why the public is also the gateway.
 I need help understanding this. I’ve looked everywhere yet no answers. Mind you we have done failover test before with no issues.
 If there is stuff I need to clarify, let me now but any help is appreciated.

 The tenant I'm working on belongs to a very small Nonprofit organization that benefits from some free Business Premium accounts. Remaining users can have Business Standard licensing.
 Let's assume that I have a mixed environment, where a few users are on Business Premium and others are on Business Standard.
 Security Defaults is enabled at the moment which is useful for many reasons, main one being automatically enforced MFA.
 Now, would I be able to disable Security Defaults and use Conditional Access for everyone? (I mean without any extra cost)
 My objectives:
  
Allow users to still have MFA (either enforced automatically or enabled manually for each user, which I don't mind doing because it's only a few users).
 Be able to send email with one specific account, using a third party web tool that supports SMTP authentication (it's possible according to this article).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends,
 Sorry for the lame title - I am not sure how to best summarize this. We have a 10g connection to Equinix fabric using a fabric "Port". Riding across that fabric are multiple "Connections" that are lower bandwidth. Since my layer-2 connection is 10g there is nothing to hold back transmission other than the policer for the fabric Connection. Is there anything I should do to policy the outbound traffic before putting it on the Equinix fabric to protect my data? I am sending syslogs across this path, and there is no current option for making those logs use a reliable protocol. Is there anything I can do to prevent or minimize the policer drops from losing those log packets? If TCP it would drop and kick off the whole TCP retry process. Bit since UDP there's just no way. 
 Right now I'm just watching the bandwidth with a 60-second graph and we're not going over 50% of our allocated bandwidth. I'm worried about the unexpected bursts due to some security event and then losing that fidelity. Is there anything I can do to help? Or is just more bandwidth the only answer outside of switching to a log relay with (more) reliable TCP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I applied for an apprenticeship for a small IT company two and a half years ago as a Junior System Administrator. Since this was my first real experience in the IT industry (I did an internship as a Help Desk Technician for another company for a year), I was pretty excited at first, but after a year and a half, I noticed that I spent most of my time troubleshooting common user problems (e.g. resetting domain and/or e-mail passwords, setting up PCs, etc.); there were also times when I did actual System Administrator work (e.g. setting up a firewall, setting up and checking on backup activities, etc.), but those times were extremely rare (even now). I've also noticed a lot of internal problems which were brought up but never fixed can be listed as follows:
 - All of us are forced to use personal phones for work; after bringing such a thing up both my boss and management explicitly told me that if I don't like it, I can always buy a new phone that I can use for work at my own expense.
 - At the same time, both my boss and management adore splurging money on parties and other such things.
 - As soon as work is lightly inconvenient everyone expects me to deal with it.
 - They also expect me to both clean other people's messes AND do my job at the same time.
 - All of the things I've learned so far I've learned on my own (except for a few things).
 - Whenever I try to complain about those problems with my boss or management I'm met with empty promises.
 Should I keep going? Or should I just try to land a new job somewhere else? Right now I'm trying to learn Red Hat Enterprise Linux and I'll probably try to set up a home lab so I can start learning how to manage an IT infrastructure since I'm not learning anything new at my current workplace...

 We have a decent amount of laptops that every patch cycle take hours of work to get our Helpdesk to track down and make sure they are getting updates. Sometimes they will be months behind making it even more of an issues. 
 What I do not want, is a laptop to be away for a while miss a critical update cycle and then join our network. Right now, we make sure devices are removed from the domain after a certain amount of days. I believe its 90 days. 
 But with the way security patches are going, some of these updates are seeming to be more critical and coming faster and waiting 3 months seems like too long. 
 How do you guys handle User accountability to making sure these get proper updates in reasonable time frame? 
 I am starting to consider locking them off the network to force them to call but not sure what a reasonable time for this lockout would be.

 Preferably being able to use one DNS server so everyone could access all the internal services in the main office without additional settings regardless of location. 
 Right now we are using ubiquity solution and it sucks, quite often users can't connect directly, but it could be "fixed" by restarting VPN service. 
 Main office is around 50people and one internet connection around 250Mbps, and branches are around 10-20 people with at most the same internet speed. And branches often use access to the file server in the main office to transfer large amounts of data, so at least 50Mbps is required. 
 Right now I'm looking at cisco 900 and cisco 1000 series, but I would be very glad to get any suggestions from someone more experienced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys
 I've been given a project that was someone else work. the guy left but started half way.
 The design that he came up with was that each switch would have its own layer 2 network. switch 1 vlan 110 (172.21.111.0/24), switch 2 vlan 112 (172.21.112.0/24) and so on.
 This can get a bit tedious to manage but my manager said in bigger networks this is the way we do things. 
 All SVI's will terminate to the core switch and then hit the transit network out the ASA.
 One of my colleagues has suggested just spanning a /23 subnet across all switches as this will be simpler to configure and manage. 
 I think that i need a mixure of both. Group switches in group of 4, one vlan for each group of 4 switches. Group 1, vlan 110 (172.21.111.0/24) group 2 (172.21.112.0/24). SVI's will still terminate to the core and then using the transit VLAN bounce out to the internet.
 What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't ask me why I am doing this haha but I am trying to setup a lab for a production environment.
 I have an older 2 Port Cisco 1800 router, inside interface 192.168.2.1, outside interface 172.16.1.100. The Outside interface is connected to a Hotspot with an ethernet port configured for IP passthrough. The hotspot is connected to my outside interface of the cisco router, the hotspot IP address is 172.16.1.1 which is my cisco routers gateway. I also have a switch connected to the ciscos inside interface which that switch interface is 192.168.2.2. From the cisco router I CAN ping internet addresses through the hotspot. This is because the source is the 172.x network. When I source the ping from the inside interface, 192.x network I get no replies. From my switch I can ping the outside interface of the router, 172.x but obviously not the Hotspot gateway of 172.16.1.1. I was thinking I needed to setup NAT on my router so I setup an access list to permit all traffic, setup nat inside source to the outside interface and configured the 2 ethernet ports from inside/outside natting. Not luck.
 I"m sure this sounds confusing but any help would be appreciated. It's probably something simple I am missing. I just can't ping from the 192.x network to the 172.x gateway on the hotspot. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question how you would implement the following:
 We are part of a large corporation and communication to the internet goes first through our own firewall that does segmentation (FortiGate 201F) only and then through the big coperation firewall.
 This is at least for our internal clients.
 Dual, we still have a DSL internet connection+router with no special firewall.
 This connection provides internet for visitors or special purposes like EC-card readers, which would not work properly through the big cooperation firewall.
 These two networks are separated by vlans.
 Normal Clients:
 Client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> Own firewall for segmentation (FortiGate 201F) -> Coperate firewall -> Internet.
 Would it now make more sense to configure a Vlan directly connected to the DSL router (which then also handles DHCP) and distribute it to the other switches:
 Zero Trust Client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> DSL Router -> Internet
 ... or connect the DSL router to our own segmentation firewall FortiGate 201F, which then provide the DHCP service and forwards it to the DSL router as next hop?
 Zero Trust client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> own firewall for segmentation (FortiGate 201F) -> DSL Router -> Internet
 The thing is, this DSL internet is not only for visitors but also for our own EC-card readers, so I would like to segment them extra, either on the dsl router or the firewall.
 And I don't know, if a simple home router will keep up with +200 leases at the same time and so on.

 Switch: Tplink TL-SG3428X (1g/10g) or TPlink TL-SG3428X-M2 (2.5g/10g)
 looking into getting this switch it mentions uplink of 10g for the sfp ports but little confused on what the speeds are for downlink between the 4 10gb sfp ports?
 Does this mean its going to be capped at 2.5gb since thats what the main ports are capped at? or is it 10gb both ways for all sfp ports and capped at 2.5g down on the main eth ports?
 If someone could confirm or provide clarity that would be awesome as im interested in picking one up depending on what that answer is.
 Thanks.

 I guess my real question is can I edit the config file to see this "1902 or higher" version of office that I need?

 I have, in one hand, a repository of several thousand word and pdf documents that are already named and filed in appropriate subfolders, in a semi-consistent format, in windows explorer/onedrive.
 In the other hand, I have about 800 uncategorized files (also word and pdf) that need to be named and filed within this repository.
 I would love to find a tool that would provide any sort of assistance here. Ideally it would look at the existing files' names and contents, and figure out how to automatically name and file the unfiled documents.
 Does anything like this exist? (I would be willing to pay for this tool if needed)

 I believe I know how to get the S switch into the proper mode. For the QSFP port, "interface breakout 1/1/25 map 10g-4x" should put it into the proper mode.
 But... what do I need to do on the N1500 switch? I'm assuming you have to configure the four 10Gb interfaces in some manner, you can't just plug all four cables in with no additional configuration and have it actually work, right? Do these four 10Gb interfaces need to go into a port group? Or is there other configuration needed to get this link to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a C# program that executes some commands that generates a pdf and print it to a printer. The printer is hosted in a print server, so the way I accessed the printer is through my app config. (\\Print Server Name\Printer Name)
 <add key="printServerPrinter" value="\\APPS-UATSVR\NPIFBCC54 (HP LaserJet MFP M430)"/>
 This program works when I run it on visual studio or even when I release it and run it via its .exe file. It has to run during work hours so I added it to Task Scheduler to start it to check something every minute and print when it found something. 
 The problem is if the program is started by the Task Scheduler It couldn't find the printer, it generates a pdf but can't send it to print on the printer since it couldnt find/open it. This is the error logged on a .txt file.
 2023-07-26 06:32:43:751191 Function:Main - Message:The printer named "\\APPS-UATSVR\NPIFBCC54 (HP LaserJet MFP M430)" could not be opened. Error code: 0
 If I start it normally there are no problems, as I have said earlier. I searched around the net but couldn't find an answer and i can't seem to debug this problem. I've tried many ways, changed the printer name, changed the port, change the backslash to forward slash but it still wont work.
 What seems to be the problem? Thank you very much in advance!

 My usually way is have the underlay and overlay in the default VRF the using VRFs for all other stuff.
 But i wanted even more seperation and wanted to try it :-)

 So initially I was trying to set this policy to uninstall an application but it looks like all I did was remove the msi from the GPO? All I did was follow a youtube guide. This is an outlook addin/plugin that is made available to download from the network (not forced).
 I went to add the msi back to fix what I initially messed up but how do I find and select the file location when shared drives are not visible. Yes it is mapped and I am connected to the domain. Is there a special syntax to point to the file? 
 It's current location is: S:\folder1\folder2\folder3\filename.msi
 So then my last question is how do I set this to uninstall from user's devices, the easiest method?

 Last week, around the 19th, someone moved more data than usual to our SharePoint server and caused us to go over 100% storage capacity. Management wants to know who and what files/folders caused the issue.
 I'm more interested in some helpful info on how those of you with more experience in this would or do handle such tasks. I don't expect management to sign off on purchasing license(s) for 365 analytics so that is a no-go.
 I did do a Compliance Audit and searched for "File Upload" events on the date range and then used Excel and Pivot Tables to create a graph and identify the user that contributed the most "File Uploads" on that date.
 We are looking for an increase of 100-200 GB above the normal trend in the span of 1-2 days. Yes, I had a one-hour presentation months ago that I spent many nights working on late into the night to make them aware they would hit their SharePoint limit, provided costs and cost projections for staying in the cloud and buying more or getting a NAS and they decided that at 90% full they should be fine because I essentially refused to give them a date when they would reach 100% capacity...

I see csfalconservice.exe in their a lot but I think that's just triggered by TiWorker.exe trying to run or clean an install I can't quite tell when I've checked resource monitor I can see it calling packages in c\windows\servicing\packages some of these years old packages for RollupFix etc. I can literally pin point the time it will do this every hour. Monthly updates are working fine on the servers, just patched this week but I feel like it's still trying to either install or clean old packages and then crowdstrike goes crazy checking what the server is up to and these disk reads fly high. Anyone experienced anything similar? Is disk clean up an option?

Is there any way to do something like auto-run on a thumb drive to avoid this mind-numbing typing?

The Android they come with is pretty average, so I'm hoping to repurpose some older windows laptops to sit behind the TVs as an option for teachers to sign into their domain account and access their OneDrive/Office etc.
 The part I'm needing some help with is some ideas about how to make this work. Each TV (laptop) could have 15+ users and storage would fast become an issue. Additionally, teachers can be in 10+ classrooms which makes it annoying to sign into OneDrive /Teams/Office initially on each room.
 Ideally I'd like to have them run as a thin client and remote into a server so storage isn't an issue, OneDrive/Office is logged in etc. I don't have any experience with this though.
 Thoughts on this situation?

 Setting up a new tenant, and I've been told to restrict all teams groups invites internal and external, but allow instant messaging between certain domains.
 I've restricted all the inbound/outbound access and added the specific domains into the Teams admin centre however I am now hitting an issue.
 We will call the tenant I'm working on Tenant A and the external tenant Tenant B.
 Tenant A users cannot be invited to Tenant B nor invite anyone in Tenant B to Teams groups - great.
 Tenant A users can still send/receive Teams meetings to/from Tenant B users - great.
 Tenant A can initiate instant message conversations with Tenant B users - great
 Now we hit the issue, Tenant B users cannot initiate conversations with Tenant A. This is not a Tenant B issue as this tenant is very open. 
 ​
 Any ideas? I looked into the Tenant Restrictions Preview in Entra ID/AzureAD, but allowing Tenant B in there opens up the ability to invite to groups again, which we don't want.

 so I'm sitting at work, and you know how ones workplace evolves over time. So by this time I'm sitting in front of three screens plus open notebook (17 inch). For various reasons I've got one workstation connected to two screens while my notebook gets one extra screen. Additionaly I've got a 65' UHD screen in here as well, for monitoring and the occasional meeting. Some other stuff with screen outputs on my desk as well, not connected permanently but only if needed.
 So as you can guess, things get messy quickly. I was thinking about getting something like this: https://www.purelink.de/en/switcher-matrices/hdmi/3431/4x4-4k-18gbps-hdmi-matrix-with-scaler-and-audio-matrix to switch between the screens because it leaves me with way more flexibility than any standard kvm switch I found, as those either don't come as a matrix switcher or don't do multi screen setups well. Then I might combine that with some kind of USB Switch.
 My question to you guys is, has anyone run something like this? Any recommendations for multi screen, multi PC setups? Happy to hear any thoughts on my setup, also very interested in how everyone else has their desk setup!

Signing out and back in solves this but I would love to understand the process behind this phenomenon. I tried googling but I guess my keywords could be zoned in.
 I would really appreciate any and all input on this as it's driving the user crazy and thus, us as well.

 I'm using SCVMM to migrate the VMs from our current hypervisors (Hyper-V) to our new Windows Failover Cluster.I have a SAN with 2 volumes configured on it, one is 18TB and the other is 9TB.I've migrated successfully over a dozen of our smaller servers (no more than 200GB) without a problem. Not it's time to move a couple of our large file servers. 
 One of the File Services is about 852GB in size so should happily fit on either of the Cluster Shared Volumes (18TB or 9TB).When I try to migrate the VM to the Cluster it doesn't appear to see the free space on the cluster shared volumes and reports that there is not enough disk space (it looks like it's only looking at the free space on the C: drive).
 Screenshot of Migrate VM Wizard
 How do I get SCVMM to see the 18TB and 9TB worth of space available so I can successfully migrate our file servers to our shiny Windows Failover Cluster that has 27TB of space but wont see it?!
 Thanks.

 Does anyone know if you're able to disable Print Notification through GPO somehow?
 https://imgur.com/a/DSzOi2M
 The way my printers are setup through GPO and item level targeting, this notification popups throughout the day. its only Richo and Lanier copiers, the HP printers are fine. 
 When the Rioch and Lanier printers are added they install a tool called either Lanier Driver Utility or Ricoh Driver Utility. No idea why, I've tried all different print drivers to stop this but I cant seem to. 
 TIA

 There is some advantages of doing this, for example you can use cloudflare public dns as your name server which makes one less thing to maintain your lab environment etc. This domain is also brand and identity neutral.
 It served me well for many years, hope it does the same for the next owner.

 When I say I'm a newbie, that's what I mean. I have zero programming knowledge and I barely know HTML. 
 I'm not looking to learn everything about python in a single book or in a week, I'd rather read something that has a build approach and doesn't try to introduce everything by the time I get to chapter 3. That's how I feel most of the 'youtube' style video playlists I've watch are like...they start with the basics and by the fourth or fifth video they have already thrown in 10 different concepts and I'm still trying to digest what I watches in the first few videos.
 These are the two books I've heard a lot of good things about, but I would like to hear from this sub and hopefully someone who has been in my shoes in terms of 'no programming knowledge' here they are:

I imagine this should be much cheaper for installers to use? My initial concern is repairability - if the cable gets cut or some pairs go bad, is there any saving it like with a typical x strand OS2?
 Is there a generally widely accepted opinion regarding these for runs between closets? I plan on talking to our usual wiring guy when I see him next, but just wanted some opinions from here first.

 We have an Intranet that is ran through an MPLS circuit. I also have an internal network that’s local to our branch location.
 If I have the users remote from the branch, they’re going to come into our WAN-side interface. VPN network will be separate and will be serviced via DHCP on a Cisco switch. Assuming I route between the two networks (VPN network and LAN network) on the firewall, will there need be a NAT Exemption somewhere to make sure my LAN-side traffic doesn’t get NAT’d when trying to communicate with VPN clients?
 Also, is there a preference over SSLVPN versus IPSec? I understand they operate on different levels of the OSI model. Since it’ll be through AnyConnect, I assume we’d need to use IPsec. 
 Thank you, everyone.

 got the task of implementing a small OSPF (Palo/Cisco) in my company and this task arrived with the previous work of consultant and some implementation of a coleague on our cisco side. This previous work consists chunks of cisco configurations for OSPF and I'm trying to understand why he suggests in the configuration to create interface VLANS (SVIs) for OSPF between routers, he used passive default and then enabled OSPF directly on these interfaces (SVIs). My coleague apparently copied these configuration literaly to the actual router. The thing is that we already have /29 networks to route between routers so it looks like that we should be using those to form adjacencies. I'm not sure if he did that be cause he didn't have complete information of our topology (that's possible) or is it something I'm missing that should be done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a bright spark at my company ordered the wrong fibre optic couplers. We are trying to convert our profibus to fibre, but here's the kicker. The converter is for MM and the clients fibre run is SM fibre. How this passed the FAT I'll never know, but here we are. 
 There's a few constraints with this, namely the ATEX areas this equipment is in. We used Bartec as they had a full rated assembly for our needs, and was fully certified. Until we noticed the converters were the wrong type. 
 Time is of the essence, and as we need to try and solve this before we demobilise, I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas. Due to the ATEX area, ideally the fix will not be an active one (I.E. The fix cannot require power inputs) as this would likely invalidate the IECex rating, and we're back to square one. 
 The fibre is under 1k in length with a few splices (I'll need to Otdr for exact losses). 
 Would these work?

 Looking for some advice as a basic user of stabket (service desk user with no admin rights). 
 I use stablenet daily for my job to check on switches that may have gone down, but would like to know if there is any way as a basic user to dig deeper and see things such as the port a user device is connected to (laptop etc) as the end user's often dont know and any other things that are useful to know as a user with limited knowledge on the system. 
 From what I've read it seems I would need admin access for most ways to identify the ports or be able to download further software requiring admin access. 
 I also use meraki if this has any way of identifying the ports for end devices too.

They don't want to pay to do it properly then do it up to their expectations. Use their systems to teach yourself. Stand up virtual environments and figure out how to do it correctly. Then just move on. You aren't critical. They will lay you off and never even think about you a second time. You are just a person that their Auditors tell them have to exist for insurance
 I just got off the phone with my buddy who's been at the same company for 6 years. He's been the sys admin the entire time and the company has no intention of doing a hardware refresh. He was telling me all this hacky shit he has to do in order to make their systems work. I told him to stop he's just shifting the liability from the managers to himself and he's not paid to have that liability
 Also stop putting in heroic efforts in general. If you're doing 100 hours of work weekly then management has no idea they are understaffed. Let things fail do what you can do in 40 and go home. Don't have to be a Superman

 I work for a very small business, and as such we ALL answer the main line when it rings.
 I asked the guy why my cel phone showed my company as the caller id calling me, and he responded with "the operator transferred me over to you".
 I AM THE EFFING OPERATOR today.
 So I replied "bullshit! Are you seriously trying to do business with us by starting off with a lie?" just silence and then 20 seconds later ... click.
 And right now, I'm more mad at myself for not thinking to milk more info from this guy and whatever scam they're trying to pull 🤬🤬🤬
 It's too early in the morning here to deal with their crap.... the first time they did this to me was around 5 am, sometime last week, so naturally I answered it thinking my boss had a super early meeting and needed help with something 🤬

 We use a basic M365 license for our email and have always gotten the occasional phishing attempt. Fortunately, everyone here is good about spotting those so we have not had any issues in the past.
 In recent days, not only am I noticing an increase in these spam messages, but some are being directly sent (or spoofed) from employee emails confirmed in Exchange message trace, and one that just came through included the subject of another legitimate email in the garbage text in the title.
 This is obviously concerning to me but I don't really know where to go for support. Does anyone have any tips or recommended resources for giving ourselves a basic security audit and making sure all of our SPF/DKIM/DMARC stuff is in order? I've been having people change their passwords as well just in case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been dealing an issue where the network performance for users has been extremely poor (1-1.5 Mbps) download speed on 1G ISP uplink.
 Here is the traffic flow underly and overly. 
 Underlay:--- 
 User-----(wireless)------>AP----->L2switch----->WLC----L2switch----->L3 Gw/PANW FW ------->SD-wAN--------->Interent. 
 Overlay:--- 
 User -------(ipsec)--------->L3 Gw/PANW ------->SD-wAN--------->Interent.
 The user overlay does connect PAN-OS firewall via GP client . PAN_OS firewall has VPN gateway configured. I am testing same file download without VPN (GP disable)- The download speed is ~400Mbps which is good but the moment I turn on the VPN (GP on) the speed reduced to hardly ~1-1.5Mbps.
 -To eliminate GP (VPN) issue, I tried the same thing on Wired infra, in both scenarios, with VPN off speed is close to ~400Mbps however with VPN on the speed is ~250Mbps which is good as well considering the overhead of ipsec encryption/deception.
 I am also in hard situation where i am unable to narrow down the issue, if i say wireless is problem then without VPN speed is good, so wireless is fine at the same time if I do VPN testing on Wired infra, VPN gives me expected throughput so I am going into loops where could the problem relies.
 So far I have seen it is combination of Wireless + VPN.
 I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue or would have any suggestions. 
 -When the AP is connected to the local network it contacts the controller as expected, picks up the desired config and broadcasts the SSIDs. The issue is that any client connect to the SSID(s) experience awful bandwidth speeds (e.g. 1-1.5Mbps d/l).
 I have verified end to end MTU on interface it is 1500 and for VPN traffic I have setup mss is 1372.
 Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

 I am about to build a new network and was thinking about building in some redundancy into it. It is a small business network of about 30 devices. 
 I wanted to ask the community if it’s common practice to have multiple firewalls and switches on site just incase one goes down. This is a network for a supermarket and credit card transactions are important source of revenue. I know this may be a dumb question but I want to try to do this the best and most cost efficient way as possible. Thanks for your input ahead of time.

 We are experiencing strange behavior with one of your guests clients. We use a 5520 as foreign controller and a 5508 as guest anchor. The guest uses a vpn in our guest Wi-Fi and he complains over his user experience( e.g. bad video calls) In the DNA Center I see a lot of L3 inter wlan roaming messages alongside deletes and switches from 2,4 to 5 GHz
 So my question is why there are inter wlan roaming messages. I though L3 inter wlan roaming is when a client moves between two aps which are associated to different WLCs? But in my case every ap is associated to the foreign controller. The guest anchor just terminates the guest traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 My MPS company after its revenue wasnt going so well and we dint had any new clients or projects decided to do some mass lay offs.
 They baptized them "temporary lay offs" where its supposed that we are still in the company but we arent paid till a new client or projects comes but it feels more like a lame way to get us laid off without paying back holidays or any compensation package. They ask us to return our equipment like laptop etc and also the ID office card which it doesnt make sense if its supposed to be a temporary lay off. Not to mention that they have closed our email accounts etc.
 So my question is how to handle this? Is there a way that we can still push back for compensation packages or something?
 I guess since they wont pay us anymore the only leverage that we have is not return the equipment and make a scene asking either for a proper lay off with compensation package and paid the untaken holidays or well a real temporary lay off where we keep the equipment till a new client comes?

 We are having issues with Ciena switches and SFPs where the port simply stops working, yet starts working again when we remove and reseat the SFP. Is there a command buried somewhere in SAOS that would allow us to reset or power down the just the one SFP?
 I believe Juniper has a method: "set cmqfx xcvr remove ..." and "set cmqfx xcvr insert ...".

 I'm probably going to be too vague in this question, but I'm not sure how to word it. Please ask clarifying questions that may help me :)
 Currently we have a number of VLANs on an HP Procurve switch (router) and it does most of our routing, with a firewall at the edge. There's no sort of Access control -- all the vlans can talk to the other vlans. All the routes for these VLANs are learned routes.
 What the company wants now is to have all traffic run through the firewall so we can more granularly control who accesses what on what port (a nightmare to me, but it is what it is)
 Is there any scenario where I can really test this, or am I looking at a rip and replace of my routing config all in one go? Can I set some sort of routing where I specify a source and next hop? Any way to specify my gateway as the firewall and have it "bypass" the routing on the switch (poorly worded question)?
 ​

 When trying to authenticate to any Microsoft Service, the "Log into your Account" Window just crashes without any error or warning. Since we are forced to use per User-Licenses in our organisation, more and more people loose access to the M365-Dekstop Suite. Other Services that require Microsoft authentication like Teams, Edge Login etc. are unusable as well (besides using the Webbrowser equivalents). 
 This issue seems to be userbased, as I do have instances where it works on the same machine with a different user. It can only be solved by deleting the user profile and creating a fresh one.
 With the help of the "Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant" im able to reproduce this by choosing the "Office & Office Apps" -> "I am unable to sign-in to activate or use Office apps." function.
 Sysinternals "TCPview" tool shows, that all network connections needed for authentication are successfully created.
 Procmon does show a lot of actions during the capture, but I wasn't able to gather any useful information from it yet.
 Any ideas on how to further troubleshoot this?
 Im happy for any input.

 Seeking quick sanity check. We have an ActionPack subscription and typically offers internal use licensing for all the latest apps. We have a need for SQL 2022 and it's not in the ActionPack? Anyone know if this is accurate?
 I see several other 2022 versions of software, Win11, etc. so all the latest apps and OS's seem to be in there minus SQL 2022... they do have SQL 2019 but need 2022. Just seems odd SQL 2022 would not be in there...
 ​
 Thank you for any feedback

The last guy left absolutely NO documentation of how anything was setup. We have a small closet with a large switch, what looks like a POE injector, a Comcast business router, and maybe a UPS, still not to sure. Is there any tools or programs I could use to discover the devices and setup of the network? There is also physical ethernet cables that seem to go random places no one knows about. Its also strange there are also 3 different wifi networks, have no idea what each one is for.

We'll be ditching Burconix soon as it isn't very good and is only useful for 1st Line issues. 
 However, Burconix comes with its own password change dialog box that is mainly used by teachers to reset student passwords when they've forgotten them and it's pretty useful as we're a big school (2k students) and having teachers raise a ticket for every password reset would clog up our ticket queue and potentially slow down lessons.
 I don't want to start giving teachers access to AD for obvious reasons so if anyone is able to give me an idea of how create dialogue box of my own or point me towards site/forum that has explanation that would be great.
 Thanks in advance.

 I made an oopsie setting up a domain on MS365, a while back and have only gone around to fix it
 When setting up the domain I accidentally put in a capital letter in the domain.
 This wasn't too much of an issue as I then just changed Set-MsolUserPrincipalName to the lowercase version through PS in AD and also changed the SMTP value to all lowercase so when emails are sent out, they are in lowercase.
 It is only in Outlook their mailbox name has firstname.lastname@Mycompany.com
 However, management would like the capital letter to be removed.
 I did explain that when emails are sent out the capital is removed and in the global address book the emails are in lowercase.
 Searching through AD, MS365 Admin and Exchange admin, the only thing that still has the capitals is the domain name in MS365 Admin and User ID in the "Edit Contact Information" section in exchange admin. I assume the User ID in exchange is what's naming the mailbox names in outlook.
 I have since removed the domain and readded the domain in with no capitals, but the users still have the capitals on their mailbox name in outlook and User ID in exchange online.
 Is there any way to change this field in AD users?

 I'm building a Windows Server 2022 with a Linux VM in HyperV. The motherboard of this workstation has 2 NICs, and my idea is to use one card for Linux VM and the other for Windows.
 I have this workstation in a shared work environment, and I don't have access to the network configuration. The sysadmin of the building gave me 2 IP static addresses that differ just for one final number. They share the subnet mask, gateway and DNS.
 In HyperV the Virtual Switch is set as External

 The problem is: if I keep the Windows NIC disabled, the Linux VM will have internet connectivity, but if I activate Windows NIC, the Linux VM will lose internet connectivity.Do you know how can I fix this problem?

 Since Covid, I was highly motivated to change careers to IT and Eventually Cyber-Security. I got 3 certs from CompTIA, Net+. Sec+ and CySA+.
 I thought, that CySA+ would open doors for me by means of landing me an entry level CS job, a mid-level IT job, or at the very least doubling my call back percentage. It has not.
 The next thing that I assumed was holding me back is my lack of degree in IT. I do have a bachelors in another field, Still I signed up for tuiton reimbursement and am working on an AS in IT. In doing so, I then completed A+ and Linux+. However, with family and work obligations, I wont be able to complete my associates for another 2 years, at least. 
 I thought that with my current certifications, and now enrollment in a program, that my resume would stand out. I have sent over 50, and have heard nothing back. 
 One problem is that I can =not go below a certain floor. I live in a very, very expensive market. For reference, fast food employees make 13 an hour here. I bring this up because true entry level IT positions here only pay 17, therefore I cannot accept a true entry level position, unless I continue to work at my current job, which has great benefits but a firm < 6 figure ceiling.

User e-mailed me to say he needed to WFH and access his office PC. We've got a shared RDGW which is used by different clients, but this client aren't on it yet as they are mostly office based. I've recently labbed setting up a RDGW at home, so was quite pleased to get this. 
 I set up CAPs & RAPs and AD Security Groups to point at them, added the PC and the user to the correct AD groups and then added him to the remote desktop users local group on his PC (I know I should do this via GP really, but wanted to get it sorted). Tested with an admin account and it worked. Sent the user a shortcut and it doesn't work.
 Spent several hours going crazy, checking and double checking what I'd set up. Relaxed the CAPs and RAPs to test. Compared it to other clients. Wondering what really obvious thing I've missed. At this point he's given me his AD password, so I test without the gateway from my PC using VPN. It works, but it's not a solution for him as he doesn't have the VPN. Out of desperation I entered his username in pre windows 2000 format and it connected straight away.
 What an earth was going on?

 Then all of a sudden, days later, we see a successful attempt again (blocked for other reasons), but successful with first password and then mfa. They still seem to have a token.
 The user did this on their home personal machine - I am wondering if the TA still has access to that laptop and they grabbed a new token when access was restored for the user last week? I can't see any way they still have a valid token.....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, just in the stages of planning new network and during our engagement with various vendors we looked at Aruba and it was mentioned that many users with controller setup now deploy large subnets for wireless clients and it is all ok as long as you control BUM traffic. I believe I saw the Aruba reference design say /16s are fine. I understand this is possible as with a controller you can control the BUM traffic as it ingresses.
 This has me wondering, is there any reason this isn't possible on wired network where you have the ability to apply centralised policy at a switch port level on ingress traffic? I know with Aruba it is technically possible to emulate the wireless setup with wired traffic by tunnelling wired traffic to controllers although we couldn't find any examples of customers doing this. Is it not possible on a traditional wired network where you have a NAC and centralised policy that can be applied at port level to discard BUM traffic there? Or is there something else preventing a move towards larger subnet sizing on wired?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Apologies if this seems ultra basic, but I am looking at testing some features on a router I have - Specifically DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) - What I would like to do is the following:
 Device A - Iperf Server
 Router with DPI running
 Device B - Iperf Client
 What I would like to do is effectively smash the link between Device A and B with as much traffic as I can to test the performance of the router with and without DPI running and compare the two. 
 As stated, the devices will be connected to the appliance locally and within the same subnet - There is an argument of course to testing the forwarding performance and the routing performance, but I'd like to cover the basics first, as far as I can tell, the difference would be simply changing the subnet for 1 device.
 Ideally, once I've set this up, I would like to have it automated such that it runs in the early morning (1-2am) and, something that would be really awesome, compile the results and send it as an attachment to an email.
 Is what I'm hoping to do feasible? Has anyone achieved this?

I'm interested if others have experience of or opinions about connecting a subset of servers directly to the underlay, for a kind of hybrid IP + EVPN-VXLAN fabric.
 The use case is where there are a mix of servers which require pure L3, L2VPN and L3VPN connectivity which are connected to a single leaf/spine network. There could be different design options to cater for that, ranging from co-locating those servers on the same leafs, splitting them onto separate leafs with common spines, or splitting them into separate pods.
 The benefit would be having one network fabric servicing all flavours of server, the possibility for incremental upgrades (e.g "upgrading/downgrading" a port from L3 -> VXLAN without having to re-cable it to a new network). 
 Are there downsides to this hybrid approach? Maybe scalability considerations as TCAM has to be optimised for both EVPN-VXLAN and "normal" IP routing? Convergence issues due to bloat in the underlay routing table?

 I recently joined a company and responsible for migrating our EAP-CHAINING with AnyConnect NAM module to TEAP without NAM Module. (with Windows GPO)
 Already I am using Group Policy to automatically enroll both computer and user certificates.
 My question is : I have followed 802.1x User&Comp Certificate creating like below. Am I Correct ?
 USER CERT :
 Start by duplicating the existing default “User” certificate inside of the “Certificate Templates” management console. 
 Request Handling Tab: 
 Optional – Uncheck “Allow private key to be exported” (best practice)
 Security Tab: 
 Required – Select “Domain User” group and check the “Autoenroll” box
 - Subject Name Tab: 
 Optional – Select “Subject name format” of “Common Name” for easier readability. This field won’t be used to obtain the username, we’ll use the UPN from the SAN (which is a default setting on the template).
 COMPUTER CERT:
 Security Tab: 
 Required – Select “Domain Computer” group and check the “Autoenroll” box

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I'm planning a switch from a current setup of Fortigate SSL VPN + Azure NPS extension for MFA to Azure SSO via SAML. Done the testing, all good, but I have 2 issues. First, I have to somehow "sell" this switch to the client (as in why this is better than the current setup) and what I'm thinking is 1. benefits of conditional access, 2. logs in only one place and 3. availability, if the radius server somehow goes offline it's bye bye ssl vpn for the users right now. Are there any other advantages that I could mention? 
 Secondly, I have to find a way to do this as "silent" as I can so the users are not...bothered. I know I could do a step by step tutorial and let them modify the existing connection profile but this is not an option. Manually doing it myself remotely is also not an option, there are almost 400 users. What I tought about so far was Intune, but this would work only if I push the full Forticlient app, so it would be a reinstall/upgrade, it needs reboot and so on. Also, I thought about just pushing the configuration via gpo, but I have no idea if the Forticlient connection settings are stored in the registry, or in some file. Any better ideas here?
 Thank you! :)

 CVE-2023-20593
 TomsHardware:
  
Tavis Ormandy, a researcher with Google Information Security, posted today about a new vulnerability he independently found in AMD's Zen 2processors. The 'Zenbleed' vulnerability spans the entire Zen 2 product stack, including AMD's EPYC data center (EPYC 7002) processors and the Ryzen 3000/4000/5000 CPUs, allowing the theft of protected information from the CPU, such as encryption keys and user logins. The attack does not require physical access to the computer or server and can even be executed via javascript on a webpage.
 AMD has patches ready for its EPYC 7002 'Rome' processors now, but it will not patch its consumer Zen 2 Ryzen 3000, 4000, and some 5000-series chips until November and December of this year. 
  
AMD:
  
Any performance impact will vary depending on workload and system configuration. AMD is not aware of any known exploit of the described vulnerability outside the research environment.

 The offer presented is more than my current position by about 12,000 annually. The other positions however are offering much more money than this one.
 Should I accept the offer and quit if I receive another one I want more? Or should I not accept this offer and see what happens with some of the other positions?
 I'm leaning more towards accepting the offer and quitting if I receive a higher paying offer. But I'm looking for advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, not my area of expertise, so thanks for any help.
 I implement web-based automation systems, basically server software that runs on a Windows based computer, and users access the interface via a webpage. They're typically setup on a customer's network and they handle all the remote access, but I frequently start systems before their network is in place and having remote access is a great time saver.
 I have been using Cradlepoint with their Netcloud Perimeter VPN which was perfect. Now that they've deprecated that option, I'm losing my simple to use system. So, I figured I'd setup a port forward like I've done before with systems that use something like spectrum business class ISP. Now after some research into why it didn't work, I'm finding that the cell service I have isn't using publicly routed IPs.
 I've tried the IOT Advanced subscription option from Cradlepoint, but it's painfully slow and not at all easy to use. Do I have any options to get some sort of inexpensive VPN option similar to what was included with the Cradlepoint Netcloud subscription? Thanks again for any help, or suggestions on a better place to ask this question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a lighting technician in the event industry who is also tasked with deploying and maintaining our network while we’re on events, and I’ve been looking for the best method to route traffic between VLAN’s while still keeping the large majority of traffic fully seperate. For example, if I have a device (2.41.10.10,255.255.0.0) on VLAN 41 (2.41.0.1) that allowed me to monitor it by accessing a web browser, and I wanted to be able to access that web browser from a device (2.11.1.x) on VLAN 11 (2.11.0.1)? How does this change if one device is on VLAN 11 (2.11.0.1) on switch A and the device hosting the web browser is in VLAN 41 (2.41.0.2) on switch B, with a trunk between the two? Both switches are running Cisco OS. I’ve tried messing with static routes a bit, but have had little luck and I’m struggling to understand the routing required, but I’m sure it’ll click with a bit of help. TIA! Definitely have a slew of other questions about routing and best practices, but we’ll get there step by step!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of Friday, July 21, 2023 11:05:56 AM, Dell was notified about a outage with a 4-hour mission critical support contract. Dell has repeatedly failed to communicate and has dropped the ball on providing their end of a support plan purchased with a server not even a month old.
 We are not even getting replies from dell. It has been over 72 hours now... We have called, emailed, and are now replacing this brand new server because we have zero confidence this will be resolved timely.
 Anyone have any suggestions? 
 Update: 7-24-23 -8pm cst
 Dell made us aware late Monday (today) that the part is not available in any warehouse in the US. We had to call and email everyone at Dell to get them to tell us this. 
 We were told they would get back to us with alternative options, different better card, whole new server, something... "soon." We have not heard back yet today. Tomorrow may be more promising and redeeming of them.
 It is a Perc raid card running an array of SSDs that they cant source. As a brand new server of the latest generation, I can only assume its because its so "new" they dont have extras on hand... the worse scenario, is that the cards are failing so fast, they dont have any to fill our warranty request :O

How in the world can Microsoft let a threat actor get their hands on MSA keys to "forge tokens and access OWA and Outlook on line" Are you fucking kidding me? And what's worse, we're just supposed to brush it off like it's no big deal? It's been almost two weeks, and there are still no new updates to the KB on this issue.
 To top it off, there's this wiz blog claiming they could have gained full access to Azure and O365! I'm beyond frustrated that Microsoft hasn't made any public statement about this; You can't make one public statement saying that they didn't have access? If you open sourced any of this, we would be able to tell ourselves.... But because understanding the Azure AD token cycle is just a piece of cake for everyone on this planet, except for me and the rest of the fucking IT people in the world who don't have 6 months to go thru Azure token training, I have to sit here and fucking guess.
 I mean, who needs straightforward explanations when you can have a delightful puzzle-solving experience trying to figure out their convoluted jargon and mind-bending concepts.
 Good luck trying to google Storm-0558, You will get 800 AI news stories on it. This one is painful.

 I'm currently noticing many output drops on CE router MPLS interface, and my client has this policing in place.
 Btw, the setup is SDWAN device -> CE Router -> MPLS.

 When someone, usually non-IT, is pushing for some wireless gizmo, I take the stance of 'always wired, unless there is absolutely no other choice' Because obviously, difficult to troubleshoot/isolate, cable is so much more reliable, see history, etc
 Exceptions are: remote users, internal workers whose work takes them all over the campus. I have pushed back hard against cameras, fixed-in-place Internet of Thingies, intercoms
 When I make an exception, I usually try to build in a statement/policy that includes 'no calls during non-business hours' if it goes down.
 I work in an isolated environment and don't keep up with IT trends much, so I like to sanity check once in awhile, am I being unreasonable? Are you all excepting of wireless hen there is a wired option? It seems like lots of times the implementer just wants it because it is more 'cool'.
 It is just really tiresome because these implementers and vendors are like "Well MOST of our customers like wireless..." I am getting old, and tired of fighting..

 There were a couple of asshats, but only like two. Anyway, I couldn’t really sleep last night and I spoke to my boss this morning. 
 First thing he said was that he thought it was going to be worse, lol. He also said that when I’m gone for a week, he forgets to check Mimecast or when I’m not in on Fridays, and that it’s not completely my fault as he never even warned me about the 48 hour thing when he showed me the system. Anyway, I think part of it was probs trying to make me feel better but I took full accountability for it, as I said that I would. He said it isn’t a massive issue, and we just talked about how I was going to sort it going forward.
 I spoke to the SS, and she was like “Righttttt…” but basically said that she’s not going to feather and tar me and thanked me when I said that I had sorted it going forward. I did apologise as I am responsible for Mimecast.
 Anyway, I still have a job and the held queue is clear.
 Thank you all for commenting. At this stage, I’m not comfortable with allowing users to release their own emails as I don’t trust that they won’t end up being stupid about it, but I will look at potentially revising the current process in place.
 I still feel a bit icky about it all, but at the end of the day, I didn’t know about it before as it hadn’t been raised. The sales supervisor said that at least now we know and it’s good that we know, which I agreed with, as it means that we can stop this going forward.
 One day, when I’m older than 22, and maybe when I’m a manager myself, I will remember this and tell my juniors about it, lol.
 This is by far my biggest fuckup in 3 years, but I think I’m going to be okay… fingers crossed!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll get users who will say we need to fix X.
 In the past Id run into, "Okay, please try again." And they'll say, "I already have." And I say, "Right, please test now..."
 So I have developed saying something like the following but a bit nicer to save time and set a baseline all in one.
  
Fixed at 13:45. Any attempt before 13:45 will have not worked. If you haven't tested after 13:45, please do so."
  
This gives me a baseline and always sets a timestamp of when it was fixed.
 Another thing -
 We're all adults. I shouldn't have to tell you, "Okay. It's Friday morning. If you dont get this to me by a reasonable time to look at, that customer may have to wait all weekend for a fix." That's on you to work the logistics out. Even if I feel bad for customer. If I get in the middle, I'm stuck in the middle. And I don't have time to do two jobs.
 There is this woman over support who doesn't do the base work. Friday I asked her how to replicate. She says we'll have to replicate the customer env in the testing env." And time stood still and I stared at my screen thinking, "Why didn't you do that before escalating to me? You mean you haven't tried to replicate the issue?"
 So I push back and tell her to let me know know when she has copied their setup to our testing env. She waited until Saturday to do it. Then first thing Monday morning asks, "Were you able to determine the issue with .." 
 I've been online an hour, Susan. It's Monday. You didn't give me what I needed until Saturday.
 I need tea.

 For media-data transport we have a network of multiple Netgear M4300 Switches. It has no access to the internet and I don’t care about security for my use case too much. Is it possible to access all the vlans from one single administration pc without having a separate connection to each one? Can you point me in a direction what I have to search for? I think it’s related to routing, but this search always ends with information about integrating internet gateways.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm troubleshooting a point to point link connecting two data centers. It's 10gig, but deployed by a provider who packetizes, so it does not behave like a traditional 10gig wave / private line which just repeats light. This means you can usually get up to several gigabits on a single TCP stream, but need more streams to fully utilize the circuit. There's about 50ms of latency between locations due to geography. 
 The issue we're having is TCP performance is mostly horrible, but sometimes goes back to near normal. Using iperf, if I test between two nodes on the same layer two vlan that's bridged across this link, sometimes I'll see possibly close to 2 gbps, as low as 100 Mbit/sec, but typically averaging out in the sub-600 Mbit/sec range. Watching the linux tcp counters, I can see numerous retransmits, timeouts, backoffs, etc. So, clearly the circuit is dropping packets. 
 If I switch to UDP and vary the send rate, 1Gbps or lower gets me 0.068% packet loss, 2Gbps 0.3%, 2.5Gbps 0.89%, 3 Gbps and we're into the 1.1%+ range with spikes as high as 6%. 
 The end to end setup had been working fine for half a year and then on a specific day began this behavior.
 Has anyone ever seen a transceiver issue cause behavior like this? My experience has been those will have light issues and/or affect all traffic types. Light is strong in both directions. They also tend to go from working to failing, not something in between. In contrast, I've routinely seen this kind of issue affect circuits when there is an overloaded node in the path, an incorrectly configured QoS or rate limit config somewhere, etc. The transit provider assures me none of that is in place nor any overloaded or failing links in the path.

 I spoke with one and their structure is that they hire experts to provide consulting on an as-needed basis.

Here is the text of the last reach out. The other one was a company called CapVision. I think this is a scheme to get in touch with the people making purchase decisions so I can get even more fucking sales calls. Anyone know if these are legit?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know in factory work they have a six-sigma or 5S standard initiatives that are used to help improve different processes and help them run better and cut waste. I am wondering if there is any kind of service or partnership known in IT that helps go through a company's support model and help with workflow, budgets, staffing, and basic day to day operations to find areas where we can improve.
 Our current IT department I feel is not utilized well, everyone wears multiple hats, everyone is on live phones, many processes don't have good documentation, or ticketing system and asset tracking is a mess, and I feel like we are spending way too much on services and tools we don't need. I am wondering about finding and suggesting an outside consulting company to our leadership that can take an unbiased look at how we are operating and our workflow and suggest how we can restructure to improve.
 It is very stressful at my job a lot of times because we don't have good structure in place, I feel every day I am just showing up and opening a mixed bag of whatever is a priority for that day and never having time to schedule or work on projects, aside from small pockets of time here and there to spend 30 minutes or so on something randomly during a week. It's a mess. But as much as I try to improve and document and organize what I am working on randomly over time, the department as a whole is pretty scrambled. If we had an expert consultant come on site and give some recommendations, I think it would be a good way to put us on track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I manage a large network with many sites.
 A rough estimate would be about 40-50 switches (most of them 48 port witb 4x fiber ports) in total - maybe more.
 And at the moment some of them are ancient HP/Aruba switches, some are a bit younger.
 All without SDN, for each port I have to go to this horrible interface of the respective switch.
 In addition, there are physically separate LAN and VoIP (so no Vlans).
 I want to kick all of this out.
 Which manufacturer would you recommend me?
 I already know ubiquiti with OnPremise Controller, that I found actually quite good, but no idea whether the manufacturer is suitable for such an enterprise network. 
 As a criterion:
 SDN - preferably with low running costs! Rather OnPrem controller than cloud.
 Fast configuration, understandable QoS settings for the future Vlan separation between Lan and VoIP.
 The hardware should not be as expensive as gold, yet offer a certain degree of durability. (Like not be eol after 2 years)
 Any suggestions?

 Now before I begin I am definitely not a network engineer and won't be implementing this I am just trying to make sure I am grasping the concept right so I would appreciate any tips and or guidance on this.. sorry if it is painfully wrong :) 
 https://imgur.com/a/6ZtiPZ1
 This is a quick diagram I did to hopefully show things better, the network is a true HA setup and will be air gapped. Each rack will contain 2 switches as the workstations have dual nics, like I mentioned there is not much info in regards to the configuration as I am just trying to make sure I am understanding the concept correctly before a network engineer starts designing further.
 ​
 Any guidance would be very helpful :) thanks.

 I'm currently working on setting up a network with redundant ISP links and MikroTik devices for a business set-up, and I could use some expert advice to optimize the configuration. Here's the setup I have in place:
 ISP Redundancy Links: Two ISP links connected to a D-Link switch DGS 1210. Redundancy is vital for uninterrupted connectivity.
 Captive Portal: A MikroTik rb 3011 router configured with a captive portal to manage user authentication and access control.
 Distribution over Fiber SFP: A MikroTik CRS106 1c 5s used for distributing the network over fiber using SFP modules.
 L3 PoE Switch: A Layer 3 PoE switch TL-SG 2210P, which enables efficient power delivery to connected devices.
 Access Point: The network extends to an EAP245 Access Point, providing wireless connectivity.
 If you have experience working with similar setups or expertise with MikroTik devices, your insights and suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I'm open to any ideas that can help me optimize this network setup and make it as efficient as possible.
 Thank you in advance for your valuable assistance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting on a new account, just looking to get everyones thoughts on this. Tried to post ITCareer subreddit, isn't as active over there.
 Currently Senior IT Systems Manager in a company based in England with 4 regional offices and 20+ branches. Team of 5 including myself.
 1 IT Director
 2 Sys Admin
 1 Trainee Sys Admin
 I currently deal with everything IT related; ERP, CRM, Department Software(HR etc), Network, Infrastructure, Procurement, Asset Management, Support, Setting up Branch's, Mobile/Tablets, 365, SQL/Databases, backup, HyperV, Storage and Programming/Design/Development.
 Basically every IT role you can imagine into one, that is the way IT has always been here.
 I have been here for around 6 years, the 2 Sys Admins 15+ years each and the IT Director 25+ Years. I have been given the opportunity in the next 24 months to takeover the roll of IT Director/Manager with also a chance to have ownership in the company.
 The 2 Sys Admins are very much stuck in their ways reluctant to new tech, struggle to keep up with demand, and very laid back. I am very much holding the IT function together as even the Director has little to no interest as he is retiring.
 I have brought up at our annual reviews the lack of interest and enthusiasm from the Sys Admins I get told they are "getting on" so will struggle and I just need to accept that they will try what they can to make sure they are keeping with the times but that's down to the individuals. I feel like they are just letting them ride it out, and hopefully they will retire in the next 5 years or so.
 These Sys Admins are on £3-4k less than me per year.
 Do I hold out and take the opportunity while still having to do all the tasks/functions above or just start looking for a new position over the next few months?

 Got a string of malicious emails sent to staff from what looks like no sender address. But it's actually "<>". Which I understand is a legit address according to RFC.
 Why does exchange allow just anyone to use this address? And two how can I stop them without breaking exchange server responses as that address is supposed to be a server response?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I think this will be a question for the Wireless guys. Do any of you know of an Android/Apple App that will monitor the Wireless Latency and Packet Loss (1sec interval preferred) of your network? Something that will allow me to ICMP Latency and Packet Loss monitor an IP address wired into the LAN to measure the WLAN Latency/Packet Loss at a site. Ideally this app will also log the AP MAC/SSID/Name that the client is connected to and you will be able to go hey I see our clients are getting a lot of packet loss near Access Point 1 for example. The dream state will allow me to upload a map of the site to the app and then do BLE/Wifi locationing to know exactly where clients are having packet loss issues on the WLAN (I know this is a dream state that probably doesn't exist yet).
 If none of you know of anything paid/free then I guess I will have to build something myself which I really don't want to have to do... I know an Ekahau has Latency/Packet Loss monitoring, but I am after an app we can put on clients and monitor all the time.

 Studying their configuration menu they seem to spit out MQTT with frames but they lack of documentation if they add all the payload of what they receive.

 There is a .net framework uninstall tool in a GitHub repo linked from MS, but when I run it, it doesn’t see any versions it can remove.
 In server admin, I can remove 3.5 and 4.5, but there are a ton of other versions listed.
 Anyway, does anyone have any advice for cleaning up old versions of .net framework? At this point I’d even try getting rid of ALL versions and reinstalling the ones I need.
 Or, does anyone know how to uninstall a single version? If I can figure that out I can script the removal of them all.

 I have tried updating chrome, I've tried using a different browser, I've reset router and PC, I've cleared cookied and cache... It doesn't make any difference. 
 I would understand if google workspace didn't work for all my accounts, but why is it malfunctioning with only one of them?

We're retiring our office over the next few months and we have a chunk (about 12TB) of data on a NAS in our rack here that we need to migrate to our Google Drive shares. We have plenty of storage capacity available in Drive and a solid 500Mbit uplink that's totally unused so no concerns around transfer times or capacity.
 ​
 So far the best option I've found to handle the transfer is this:https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/9222862
 The requirements are quite daunting - we don't really have much hardware in this office (it's primarily used for video content production) outside of the NAS, and Workspace Migrate requires 3 relatively beefy Windows Servers. 
 Obviously there's the option of just uploading in chunks each day until we hit the upload quota for the accounts we're using - but ideally I'd like to use something a bit more elegant. Does anyone know of any services, scripts, open-source projects etc. that might be helpful here? I've already reached out to a few that I've found (CloudFuze and a couple of others) but would appreicate if anyone has any other suggestions!

 I am looking for some suggestions on how do we better provision servers in our environment. I'll try to explain it as detailed as possible. 
 For example, every admin in our environment creates a server differently in the sense that they dont see the correct settings etc, dont disable weak security encryption etc, its all build in a mess. I don't want to just create a document, but maybe use a tool which has maybe a VM template and can automate all of this. Will something like SCVMM do the job? Or is there something else? 
 SCVMM came to mind because then it also comes with Orchestrator, which we can build to automate the user provisioning etc but again, this is just because i don't know other options.
 The more automation the better, of course not everything can be done in that way. Also we use Azure as well as hyper-v and Vmware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I have a strange case at a company where they use a Mitel MiVoice Business (Release level: 8.0 SP3 PR2) and each time User A (Alexa) calls User B (Bruno) it shows the right name. But in the Missed, Outgoing and Received Calls lists it always shows the name of a former user C (Chris).
 The way we put the extension in place was we removed the old extension entry to set it up from scratch. Factory formated the phone (Mitel 5312) and now it still shows in those histories with the wrong name.
 There even is the same issue with just a contact of a phone directory entry. We give some people a company mobile phone and one of those phones changed hands to a new person (Jane Goodall). So when that person calls it always displays the name of the former user (Sandra Bullock). The only place I know where to look for is under "Users and Devices" > "Telephone Directory Management" > "Telephone Directory".
 There is no more entry even remotely having the former user's name and it somehow still stays in the system. Does anyone have an idea on this?
 Edit:
 No personal entries were created on any of the affected phones

 How to you detect the availability of a new version of a (installed) software?
 I want to know the lastest version to review them and then update our servers/computers 
 I would prefer not using a new application
 We are using Intune to update but it doesn't seems to check the availability of new version on editor website
 Is there any website which centralize the new version of each software? something similar to https://cve.mitre.org/ but for all new software version and not only security patch? 
 It would be better if I can import/link to intune to get the list of installed software but I could work without it
 ​
 Thanks in advance !

We have several protected computers VM and physical machines and everything works great. I have been tasked to setup a new server with windows server 2019 standard and add the server to the DPM. Whenever i try to install the protection agent through the DPM Administrator console this error comes up. 
 Error 402: When trying to retrieve information from the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service on testSERVER.example.local, access was denied. 
 I'm using Domain Admin credentials btw.The second thing i tried was installing the agent manually via cmd as administrator. This was a success and it also added some firewall exceptions. Having installed the agent manually i tried attaching it but i had the same exact error 402. 
 Now i tried installing the agent manually on a windows 10 pro machine and as soon as i installed the agent manually the computer popped up on the management section no problem. I'm thinking there may be some compatibility problem with the version of DPM. If anyone can help me it will be much appreciated as I’m at a loss.

 every night I use DelProf2 to delete the local user profiles (the roaming profile is still on the DC) from my terminal server farm, as they are distributed through a load balancer.
 When I do this, it always gives the following error: Could not delete key <SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Search\UninstalledStoreApps. I wonder if this can cause probleme later or this is the best solution.
 Does anyone know a better solution to delete the profiles than using delprof2?
 Thanks a lot

 Our deployments are fully unattended, but when it comes to setting up the laptop with the dock and monitors, the monitor order is wrong every so often, and the primary monitor needs to be set.
 Is it possible to do this without logging into Windows? Is there a smart shortcut from the login screen that I'm unaware of? I know of Windows + P to set it to extend the monitors instead of duplicating.
 I could log in with my own account or administrator account to do so, but then I have to wait for the login, have my user profile created on the users laptop, and then finally it also would show it as the default user on the laptop, when the employee wants to log in for the first time.
 How do you deal with it?

I'm looking to see if there are any tools out there that might take a single TCP flow between two hosts and split it up into several flows over an ECMP WAN and then recombine at the other end (induced latency is OK for this requirement.) I have many 1Gb/s paths between two points but I have some elephant flows that are stuck on a single path for a long time. I'm struggling with my google-fu figuring out what to search for, I'd guess its going to be pretty niche if it exists at all. I'm looking to to treat traffic after it leaves the source as the source is an appliance I can't modify. I can't replace the 1Gb/s paths with faster paths unfortunately.

 I currently have FolderRedirect in use.
 I have enabled in the GPO that the start menu and some other folders should also be stored there.I would like to undo this for some folders now that it is stored in the "normal" profile.
 Is there any way I can get the contents of the folders back into the user profile? As far as I know, these folders are then empty in the profile, or in the old state.
 Does anyone have an idea what I can do? Or is there only the solution to copy the files and contents manually or with a script?
 Thanks
 EDIT: I'm not sure, that i had enabled the option "redirect the folder back", before i enabled FolderRedirect.
 Is there any way I can see what settings FolderRedirect used to create the folders?

 But the 1% remaining Im tasked with doing the rest. ~400 computers. First I need to find out what PC is currently using what license(generic or digital) then update all the generic ones. Our remote software has this information but doesn't have the ability to export the product key in the csv

 This does not work for us in any EXO v3 module (v3.0.0 - v3.2.0). If we instead use a v2 module (2.0.5), it still works. The experience is that after you press <Enter> in v3, nothing happens other than the cursor drops to a new line. The only way to terminate the cmdlet is to close the PowerShell session. In v2, you receive the "are you sure" prompt.
 Anyone else experiencing this issue? If not, I'll be suspicious of our conditional access policy for REST clients, but no other cmdlet is affected that we know of.

 Managing our service operationally has become a little hectic and we've been slapped on the wrist a few times for missing SLAs recently. Our director end of last week gave us hints about how the current process of 1 on-call engineer having to manage all 80 production deployments is getting a little crazy and that our MTTR (minimum time to response) is way too high... 
 Eventually... he proposed we start automating some stuff such as root cause analysis/canary analysis/early anomaly detection - especially with the new AI buzz, and as a lead engineer asked me to look into it.
 Anyone have experience dealing with this kinda situation? I wonder if there's a way the MTTR can be reduced using processes. Maybe better training with the remaining members of my team? or even like using PagerDuty better? Or any service that helps solve this?
 I'm pretty frustrated atm cuz i already have enough sht to do. I don't think this is gonna solve anything. If we end up working on this I'm going to quit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick backstory, I came on board a company that had their previous IT person pass away unexpectedly. This person was the bearer of all secrets basically, so nothing seems to be "typical" and I have had the joy of problem solving all of this the past few months, reverse engineering the pieces of you will. 
 Last week we had an issue with our Juniper SRX340 Firewall at one of the buildings. The power light is green, yet the "STAT" light is solid amber. I am trying to get into the device to troubleshoot. But i am blocked getting to it from the server (obviously) and connecting to the management port does not seem to do anything. The guide on Junipers website shows "figures" for ports our SRX340 does not have. 
 Can someone please tell me how to connect to the SRX340 to check what the error is? My thought is the device isn't fully booting, and that's why I'm unable to manage/access any "normal" way. But thought I would ask in case I'm missing something, regarding how to manage/access the device to check why the "STAT" light is amber! 
 P.S. I let it boot for about 45 minutes and it would randomly (at no obvious intervals, as I was timing the power up) the fan would kick on into high speed, and the "STAT" light would turn green for about 5 seconds, and then back to Amber. Also, if I can find a backup of the device, how would I restore it?

 Have had someone request to change their last name in our organization, this is not the first time someone has requested this and usually we just go into active directory and change their display name, last name and then their display name in exchange. This then doesn't change their email address or their username when logging into the computer. How can i do this properly going forward so it changes everything and emails continue being sent to them even when their email address is changed?
 Thanks heaps!

 I already knew how to program, rebuild computers from other parts, and do some basic networking, but when I read this book as a high school kid, that's when I figured out I wanted to go into network administration. Five years later, I was managing the core services for a 1500-endpoint network in Silicon Valley. I haven't personally experienced the excitement of being at the center of an international data theft incident like Mr. Stoll was, but I've had my share of exciting situations nonetheless. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I am running an Ethernet over GRE tunnel in a test environment and have a couple questions:
 This lab setup has four VyOS routers with MTU set at 1538.
 SRC -> R1 (source of GRE tunnel) -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 (destination of EoGRE tunnel) -> DST
 SRC is physically plugged into R1.
 DST is physically plugged into R4.
 Intermediate links are ethernet or AirFiber AF5XHD (MTU = jumbo frames)
 Reading the config file on the airfibers shows:
 ame.net.jumbo=enabled
 netconf.4.mtu=1538
 netconf.3.mtu=1538
 netconf.2.mtu=1538
 netconf.1.mtu=1538
 I can ping and run traffic normally between SRC and DST.
 However, when I run a traceroute, I still show intermediate hops, which doesn’t make sense, since the GRE tunnel starts at R1 and ends at R4, and should act as a transparent wire, correct?
 When this happened with MTU 1500, I changed all intermediate links to 1538 and routers to 1538 MTU, and rebooted everything. Do I need to change MTU to something even higher? Are the MTU settings what are causing these intermediate hops to show up?
 traceroute to 172.18.2.54 (172.18.2.54), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets
 1 * * *
 2 * * *
 3 172.18.2.54 (172.18.2.54) 12.438 ms 9.779 ms 9.727 ms

 Our label maker recently broke and before I go ahead and replace it with what we’ve got, I’d be curious what you have used and liked.
 We’ve had a Dymo Rhino 4200 for the last decade+. I would not call us a heavy use case. We use it to label various hardware in our racks - routers, firewalls, switches. Along with cables - flags for fiber, wrap around for power and Ethernet.
 The device we have gets the job done, but there are times for those larger projects it would be nice to have the ability to feed in some data when we have to create 50+ labels rather than type them all manually into the Dymo.
 What have you used and been pleased with?

I’m looking for some advice for securing some sort of sys admin role in that specific job market, as well as any other direction in becoming an admin in general.
 I have a year and a half of experience working on a tier one help desk for a large company, which became tedious and somewhat boring when each interesting ticket I came across had to be escalated to other teams. I then moved to the current MSP to gain some real hands on experience, which I most definitely have, wearing multiple hats every day since we’re such a tiny team. In the additional year and a half here, I believe I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals working with firewalls, servers, O365, Azure etc daily. 
 I have no certifications currently but, working through CCNA and Azure 104 to not only get them under my belt, but to start filling in all the little knowledge holes I may have from jumping in to the deep in and learning to swim as I went along.
 Anyway, I’m mostly looking to hear from folks that work or have worked in the city, especially any quirks related to landing a job, living and working there, or maybe any mistakes you made along your way. I’m just a 3 year old IT baby, but I’m convinced it’s possible to make it happen for myself.

Whether they are fancy/smart enough to publish their own "Azure App" or they want you to register one in your AAD tenant.
 There are at least 2 ways to access/send emails via:
  
GraphAPI - via Mail.[Some action] application permissions
 Office 365 Exchange Online API - IMAP/SMTP/POP.AccessAsApp (doc here)
  
What freaks me out is giving "Admin consent" to these apps. Does this mean they get to use these permissions on ALL of our users? Its the kind of thing that does not let me sleep at night.
 From RTFMin a bit I've come to the conclusion - please confirm or correct me:
  
if application permission is via GraphAPI - yes, the Mail.* permissions are given to the app on ALL mailboxes in the org. You HAVE to use ApplicationAccessPolicy to limit the app's access (doc here).
 1. if application permission is via 1. Office 365 Exchange Online API - no, there needs to be an explicit Exchange Service Principal and that be assigned mailbox permissions (as implied in the doc here). Tested with the test tool mentioned in this blog (used temporary secret)
  
If I got that correct, now my questions is - are there other APIs that mail? How - as an admin - am I supposed to know and VERIFY the level of permissions granting admin consent will provide this app? Am I missing something in my Azure App/SP understanding and it supposed to be obvious?
 If you there is a better place for such a question than please also do point me there (I see a lot of technical questions downvoted here stating that there are better and more specific subs).

 I have recently resigned and serving my notice period. Due to this I don't get a lot of work or any work for that matter.
 So recently, I have been working on a research paper and downloaded it from my Linkedin account. I worked on it and then when I was sending it back (on Linkedin) a Forcepoint DLP popup came up saying "Confidential Data detected" There was a user override option stating "This is my personal data, and doesn't contain "Company's" confidential information." I selected that, and sent the same.
 Now I am worried that I will be in trouble. Just to be sure, there is no confidential information in the paper, all the information is publically available and is referenced properly. I work in a legal role, so we regularly get such research papers for different laws. 
 What will happen when I have selected the user override option? 
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When putting the whole organisation in scope for Cyber Essentials, then it's my understanding that all cloud services used by the organisation will be in scope.
 Has anyone managed to put the whole organisation in scope when it uses some systems and services which have limited administrative capabilities, such as lacking MFA, SSO, ability to support multiple accounts, etc. From the mock submission we've did for Cyber Essentials, a major non conformity was raised for using systems not supporting MFA. 
 In this regard Cyber Essentials appears more stringent than ISO 27001. There later indicates controls should be appropriate to the level of risk. Therefore MFA may not be a necessity if other controls can be used to mitigate risks. For Cyber Essentials, MFA as a control seems non negotiable, i.e. mandatory.
 For context, here are some examples of systems I'm thinking about: - Finance systems used to manage employee company pensions - Finance systems used to manage corporate investments - Healthcare systems used to manage private healthcare benefits - Cycle to work schemes used to offer employee benefits
 Some of these systems are big household names, used by many many companies. They are sometimes difficult to transition away from meaning they'll be in use for the foreseeable.
 In summary, I'm trying to understand if the use of such systems will cause us any issues when working towards Cyber Essentials.
 Any help and advice would be appreciated 😁

We know it's not per 24 hours because if we delete the migration batch and restart it, it continues another 2 GB. We tried slowing the migration down to 1 account at a time but it still hangs but does not technically fail. It just keeps saying "Syncing..." but the account size isn't getting larger after the initial 2 GB (per batch delete and recreate retry). All accounts under 2 GB synced fine. We've opened a ticket with Rackspace, no response as of yet.
 Does anybody have any ideas? Thank you.

I've been in IT for six years, but my qualifications for my position included a year of previous experience supporting a VDI and raising my hand first when the prior virtualization SME left for greener pastures. I always feel like an imposter who will eventually be discovered as a fraud who bluffed their way into the position. None of this relates to my question, just trying to explain my frame of mind.
 On Friday, I was approached by one of the leads in hushed tones. He said one of the next-level supervisors was departing, and rather than try to fill their spot, their supervisory responsibilities were being split. I was asked if I would like to take a few of those (time-sheet sign-off, minor HR things) for a pay bump. Said to think about it and we'd have a bigger talk next week.
 I know the big stuff: get it in writing on my contract spelling out my responsibilities, but what else should I keep in mind? How can taking on supervisor roles affect IT work? Does anyone regret it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, throwaway for privacy.
 I'm 21, based out of the US.
 Ever since I was a boy I loved systems and always knew this was my path, but now I'm not sure where should I focus myself.
 I did Java & Python programming in high school and realised coding isn't really for me, at least not as the main part of my job(I adore batch scripting and powershell though).
 At 16, I started learning about computer hardware via Youtube and became a remote PC consultant, I became quite good at it, consulted for over 100 different systems and built some of them personally, even offering repair services to close friends. I realised this job can't be for the long term because of the pay and left it at that.
 At 18, I worked for a telecommunication company and acquired coax & fiber knowledge alongside basic networking.
 At 19 I became a network administrator and did a bootcamp(although I did more basic helpdesk duties and network technician duties).
 Now I'm 21 and I'm leading that network administrators team(which infact does helpdesk and technician duties), I deal with onboarding/offboarding people from my company and configuring Cisco devices, IT documentation, some virtualization with VMware as well with some other physical network stuff.
 I have a homelab which has a hybrid Active directory environment mixed with azure. 
 I hold comptia a+, Microsoft az-900, az-104 and I'm close to comptia network+.
 The problem:
 From a lot of people, I hear system administration is dying, it's either moving to the cloud or getting automated so demand is decreasing.
 What can my options be? I feel that in this field it's so hard to find a path, as it expands so much
 Become a Sys admin? Focus on cloud administration? DevOps? Microsoft specialist(if that's even a thing)? Should I just quit and do a Bsc in network engineering?
 I would really appreciate if you have any insights for me.
 Thanks for reading.

 I've had a domain with Google domains for a few years now which I've held but not used it just so the name of the domain isn't taken by someone else. 
 However now with the squarespace buyout of google domains, I'm looking to move the domain to cloudfare. One of the things I liked about google domain was the cheap annual cost (£10), especially for something I'm not fully using. Checking cloudfare, I'm being quoted $20 a month for the pro package which is more than I've spend total over the past 2 years with google domains! 
 The options I think I have currently:
  
Take the cloudflare basic package and pay $0 annually. If I decide to finally use the domain to build a website I'm not sure if it will be able to handle traffic?
 
Seek an alternative domain registrar - Not sure who else can offer the same features and cost as I currently get with Google domains?
 
 Any help is appreciated!

 Corporate Laptops and Workstations

 All the systems have been appropriately segmented using VLANs on wired networks.
 I have a few questions that I hope you can help me with:
 1- Considering the diversity of systems, how do I determine the optimal number of SSIDs needed for effective segmentation without causing unnecessary complexity?
 2- What are the recommended authentication methods for each SSID to ensure data security and convenient access for the respective user groups?
 3- In the context of enterprise wireless practice, should we have separate SSIDs for each band (5GHz and 2.4GHz), or is there a more efficient way to manage wireless bands for our specific setup?
 Your expertise and insights will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

 I apologize in advance if this isn’t the right place for this post. I'm currently working as a Tier-2 helpdesk technician for a call center, which primarily comprises a remote workforce. Recently, we have been transitioning some of our users from traditional workstations to Azure CloudPC.
 Prior to this migration, our employees were using Cisco AnyConnect as their VPN solution. However, we were encountering persistent issues with call drops, primarily due to the users' connections. With the Azure CloudPC, we've seen a significant reduction in the number of dropped calls.
 Despite this improvement, we're now experiencing a new problem: there's been a noticeable audio delay reported by the users who've been migrated.
 While searching for solutions, I came across this, which introduces a concept of multimedia redirection: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/multimedia-redirection-intro
 I'm wondering if anyone here has encountered similar issues or can provide insights into whether this multimedia redirection could serve as an effective remedy to our audio delay problem. We use Five9 contact center software. Any advice or experience you could share would be greatly appreciated. I’m just sick of all these tickets coming in. 
 Thank you in advance.

 Now they are requisting global admin previlage for everything to a full time worker and want me to explain the whole infastracture for him.
 This company is known for fuc*ing up people and not paying them, and i have no official legal contract with them.
 I hate to do this kind of acts and never did it before, but i am thinking to only hand everything after they pay me at least 8 months of the prior work.
 What would you do if you was on my place?
 Also, sorry if this is the wrong sub for this kind of articles, i am not fimilar with reddit in general.

 We have a mix of Power Users, Developers and Data Engineers that will end up using VDI. 
 Power users and Data engineers are more compute intensive, such as SSMS, Power BI, TreeSize, etc. 
 Developers tend to use things more like DOT net sdk, vscode, visual studio code, nodejs, some SSMS, etc. 
 I’m looking at 4 CPU, 16 gig ram, but unsure if that’s overkill. 2 CPU & 8 gig ram might ideally suit developers more. Thoughts? 
 Machines will all be optimized, locked down, GPOd and enhanced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please correct me if I'm wrong:
 My assumption is that a network firewall can filter traffic between different subnets, so you cannot put a firewall to filter traffic in same broadcast domain, right?
 I'm saying this becase this article seems to imply that a firewall can filter traffic in the same subnet:
 If your network doesn’t have a guest wifi network and your Iot devices are on the same subnet as all other devices, you could (but it may be cumbersome) assign a static IP to MAC address assignment for the IoT devices so they get a block of IP addresses an assign firewall rules to that block so that it can’t talk to the rest of the network that is on the same broadcast domain (really? I assumed a firewall doesn’t filter within the same subnet), but again, even so, those devices would have access to the mgmt. interface, so you should set up a very strong username and pw.

 Any insight much appreciated.

 I have a customer that purchased a refurb Dell R440 and I went ahead and used a Dell ISO from another clients Digital Locker to install Server 2022 Standard as that is the environment my customer will be using, but yet hasnt obtained licensing yet for.
 When I boot into Server 2022, the OS works but it isn't activated. Is it possible to install or activate the trial from a non activated standard installation?
 I know this sounds backwards (as it is), but I need a functioning server using the 180 day trial otherwise I keep getting D/C'd with networking and stuff while prepping for their migration project. The reason why I used a Dell Digital Locker ISO is to ensure that the drivers and everything during deployment would be included in the install.
 I'm also familiar with actually changing product keys and activating/upgrading using the following documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/upgrade-conversion-options#converting-between-retail-volume-licensed-and-oem-licenses but there is no option to change from a running un-activated Server license to a trial listed.
 Any help would be appreciated. I'd like to avoid having to re-install everything again.
 Thanks in advance.

 I’ve been in IT for 21 years. Desktop mainly, with dips in and out of infrastructure, but always user-facing.
 I got pressured young, like so many of us, to find a ‘proper’ job and after one false start (doing something completely unrelated), it felt like all the ‘adults’ around me cranked up the intensity on said properness, and I had to get work fast. So I took a job selling records and movies and hardware at a big name chain store (which I loved) while searching for a way into IT. Why?…]]></summary>

 I currently have FolderRedirect in use.
 I have enabled in the GPO that the start menu and some other folders should also be stored there.I would like to undo this for some folders now that it is stored in the "normal" profile.
 Is there any way I can get the contents of the folders back into the user profile? As far as I know, these folders are then empty in the profile, or in the old state.
 Does anyone have an idea what I can do? Or is there only the solution to copy the files and contents manually or with a script?
 Thanks
 ​
 EDIT: I'm not sure, that i had enabled the option "redirect the folder back", before i enabled FolderRedirect.
 Is there any way I can see what settings FolderRedirect used to create the folders?

 We currently manage our own terrestrial infrastructure globally and purchase our own capacity across these links for our global clients.
 Like all businesses, there is a push to drive down cost, get better visibility, and be more agile in getting sharp pricing. 
 Current annual spend is 6-10M USD. 
 Currently our network is driven by MPLS and with a wider adoption of SDWAN, has anyone transitioned over to a full SDWAN core?
 There are two motives, one is to reduce cost on the terrestrial. Is it now time to look at other global carriers to offload some of our circuits, or is this likely to have a negative effect on cost when we manage it ourselves. 
 The second, can we achieve better outcomes utilising our own SDWAN core, incorporating internet solutions as backup paths with global ports in different POPs etc. Utilsing a SDWAN core could potentially remove the requirement for a MPLS equipment and utilize SDWAN software (and likely cheaper hardware) for the routing engines, maybe cheaper than utilising a Juniper/Cisco core?
 Has anyone gone down a change in mindset on service delivery?

 My current title is Systems Engineer at a small MSP. I got a title bump and a raise a couple of weeks ago. We’re a team of 4 and come Monday we will be a team of 3. This essentially puts me in a senior mentor position. I know one of my team members can handle their own self under pressure while my other colleague lacks the experience / depth of knowledge to own a sufficiently technical case without supervision. 
 We manage everything from firewalls, backups, clusters down to networked and USB printers for most of our clients. At this point my boss expects me to step away from the technical and assume an operational role which would be nearly impossible with the current situation. I have closely worked with these folks and we all know each others’ strengths and weaknesses.
 It all just feels like stepping into someone else’s shoes that are 2 sizes too large.

 I am managing a fairly sized network with two datacenters. Currently we are using stretched VLANs which we would be glad to move away from to something more modern and robust. A third greenfield datacenter is being built and it seems logical to implement a spine-leaf fabric with VXLAN EVPN. We are a Cisco shop which is something I have little influence over. But after doing the research on datacenter technology I believe Cisco is not bad only maybe overpriced.
 I have limited experience with VXLAN technologies and multicast but have been studying the technology for a while. I would be very happy if someone could help me validate things as there are few examples in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First post (Please be gentle)
 I'm setting up the on-prem infrastructure for my family's small business (start-up). Currently, there are 10 laptops and approximately 10 users.
 We have Microsoft 365 Business Basic licenses (1 TB storage per user).
 Major requirements for the AD:
  
Locking down application installs (UAC admin only)
 No unnecessary downloads(Torrents, any media etc)
 Forcing logoff during nonactive hours/ forcing Windows updates
 Roaming profiles with predefined software installations
 Remotely accessing laptops for troubleshooting any issues
 File server (For sharing files within the network or outside)
 Daily backups
  
Please suggest anything I missed, it is my first time setting up a server. 
 Note: We are not hosting any applications or using Azure AD in our company. I did not find any use case or need more reading of it's documentation. 
 Questions
  
Which version of Windows Server? 2016 or 2019? Standard or Essentials?
 Should I go for a file server along with the DC or Onedrive is enough?
 Is a server on the premises necessary or Azure AD can do my work?
  
Please guide.

 I am working on a new DWDM project to upgrade our optical line system to a newer version that support SSON.
 Currently we are on the design phase , and we faced a problem during simulating 400G circuits (Higher than 60Gbaud) on one of our long spans , as the modeling tool is reporting very bad OSNR.
 In order to improve the results ; one of the parameters that we changed was the SD (Spectral Density) , and we noticed that the OSNR of the circuit was greatly enhanced once we decreased the Spectral Density.
 Was wondering if anyone can explain the relation between the spectral density and OSNR , also if we changed the spectral density setting on the optical gears , shouldnt that affect the existing signals , as we are changing how the whole spectrum with its frequencies is alocated ?
 Thanks.

 Any idea why I would see such high packet loss between 2 switches and a UDM Pro?
 UDMPro is 192.168.1.1, ping results are from a hardwired macbook to the UDM pro pinging a USW-24 -PoE switch (192.168.1.4) and a USW-24-Poe-PRO (192.168.1.3)
 Both switches are connected independently wired to different ports on the UDM Pro.
 Changed cables out, still seeing loss.
 Problem just started happening this morning and I updated everything to the latest version of firmware (what!)
 I searched /var/log/messages on the pro but didn't see anything untoward either.
 SSH into the UDM pro shows cpu temp and load are nominal. Unifi support tickets are rubbish, probably should switch this crap out.

 We are planning to move from our current MPLD WAN (from service provider A) to SDWAN (Palo & service B) with a one more service provider. So we will be running two providers links at the same time...
 So my questions: Currently, our public domain names pointing to public IPs provided by Provider A, how can we get Public DNS to point to the new IPs at the same time?, For example, mail.company.domain.net or adfsproxy.companydomain.net pointing to two public IPs Is this possible? Any issues I should consider?

 Only assured part time despite often doing months of full time work, no wage increases, no permanent full time, no benefits whatsoever. Total toxic workplace .
 I am not sad to see that gone. 
 I had a hunch that something like this may happen, as the new director we got is totally IT illiterate and I'm still wondering how the hell he got the job as he was new to the company. I figured because I couldn't perform the miracles he wanted of me yesterday that he would try and get me removed .
 ​
 Instead it seems to come down from the ownership that they are going in a different direction and plan to outsource me (likely cheaper). 
 I have been trying to find another job, but the job market in my area is cutthroat and a lot of the jobs I have applied for either need more experience, they never return my calls or the posting is cancelled as they don't have the budget for it.
 ​
 Its annoying to go back on EI for the time being, but not much choice.
 ​
 Not sure what the point of this post is, I think maybe just a bit of venting .
 I do take some small comfort that things are going to suck for the other employees shortly, as they are rolling out a new system this week that had the other IT staff running around trying to fix the broken mess so they don't have me to fill the holes of other issues and the ticketing system. 
 There will be complaints streaming in soon and I don't think my remaining senior IT staff will stick around long, as he hired me to help him out and now he has to do what I do on top of his job.

 The first bears a date of January 2004 and (62.5/125) on the jacket. OM1. Yuck.
 The second bears a date of May 2010 and (MM50 PRETIUM 150) on the jacket which Google/Corning says is OM2. Also yuck. But not as yuck.
 The distance marker indicates that the run is 580 feet from conduit mouth to conduit mouth. There's another 30-40 feet coiled up near the termination box on either end.
 And that's not all. The newly selected network closet for each building, where the run will actually enter the switches, will require another 50-100ft on either end.
 So, switch to switch, we're looking at a maximum distance of 860ft / 262meters. It MIGHT be a bit less than that, but not much less.
  
So what's the play here? Can we get 10GBIT/s out of this or are we going to be LACP'ing some 1gig connections to try and get close?
 I don't think 10GBASE-LRM + Mode conditioning patch cable gets us there either; most have said the max distance is 220m. 
 What would you do if you were in my situation?
 We can't pull new Single-Mode fiber for a bunch of stupid reasons, but the main one is that the conduit between the buildings hits an outside junction box. That junction box is... underneath a concrete parking lot now. Yeah. They poured Concrete over it. We've tried pulling on some of the MMF to see if we could use it as a pullcord, but no luck.

The reporting needs to be able to aggregate usage and not just show a monthly report with hourly averages. It needs to be able to capture daily averages in minutes for example during peak usage times. The basic reporting tools built in monitoring tools tend not to be able to do this. I have seen a few products that will aggregate the data because keeping all the data and running a OnDemand report just takes too long over extended periods. It can be a monitoring and reporting tool or just a easy to use reporting tool we can feed API data to for example. Thanks in advance.

 He gets confused a lot. Admits he feels confused/incoherent sometimes. Takes a lot of days off. Tells us he's in and out of the doctor's offices multiple times a week. Expresses his interest in just sitting back and taking it easy now to let us take over.
 Unfortunately I've also found tons of issues across the system, including the fact that our product we sell to customers is just not very good. Customers are unhappy, and I want to work at a place I am proud of. Our MS licensing is a mess and management doesn't seem interested in hearing my concerns on it. Really... just problems I don't want to deal with since I've learned I'd rather just write SQL than be an IT generalist for a small outdated business.
 So, when an opening came up through someone I know to go back to doing that, I took it, and gave my notice today. It will almost certainly be better for me. I just feel really bad for leaving this guy who has bigger problems than work to be dealing with, and sounded like he was putting a lot of faith in me sticking around.

 For some reason I'm having some issues with a local BGP session being stuck in active using pathvector (bird 2.0) and pfsense (FRR)
 The IP of the bird router is provided by the frr router's LAN, it's pingable on both sides. 
 Frrs neighbor config is pretty standard, nothing differing from any other established connections there. I'm a little bit confused because it's literally a local connection so no need for multihop! Trying to announce another ASN through a 2nd router basically and upstream it with our main one. 
 Any pointers to look into? We have a handful of peers, I've been doing bgp for a while and am pretty stumped. I'm not seeing anything in the logs, and I'm also just not sure why it's stuck considering the ips are pingable on both sides. No firewall or port filtering, I've made sure to set static routes on the bird router, ASNs are correct, router IDs are not conflicting, etc. It's a local connection, there is no reason that I can tell that it'd get stuck.
 Any help would be kind, thank you!

 ​
 So I've been considering the military, specifically the Air Force. Would this look good to a potential employer after my service term? I know military experience looks good in general, especially in networking and security. Serving would also open up funding for further education, which seems to be more and more important.If anyone has experience starting out in the military, I would love to hear it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys
 So I'm being challenged on why we are insisting on having the ability to remote wipe corporate emails on personal moblies, specifically Outlook via the Outlook Device Policy.
 The argument is that you can just disable the account and the person cannot get into the mailbox anymore.
 I have argued that what if you don't want to disable the account, you just want to remove the emails.
 I'd appreciate your thoughts as this is being argued by a very senior member of the organisation.
 Also Outlook Device Policy states it should wipe on bad logons. Our policy in Exchange Online states 8 bad attempts, but I can do 20 or more and it doesn't wipe, so I'm note sure what's happening there...

 If your boss comes to you Friday afternoon because another department (let's say marketing) have a really important client thing on the Monday that will require 2 days of work to get something installed, written up or fixed. Something they've known about for 3-6 months but have only approached IT at the last minute because "the previous guy would do it " or it's just expected...
 How many of you would tell them to piss off? Genuine question.
 Edit : WOW! Some great responded guys and gals. My biggest issue has always been that IT departments around the world have been too easy to push over & not willing enough to fight their own corners over unpaid short notice overtime & insisting on new kit
 From these responses it looks like this is changing for the better!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Team, 
 Currently working on a SDWAN environment and I need you input about MSTeams.
 We just switched a site to SDWAN using simply an MPLS transport connection. However, we recently received a report on the quality of the MSTeam. In light of this, I'm curious as to what would be the ideal practice for guaranteeing the MSTeam's priority (e.g. QOS, Symmetrical flow etc) and what steps would be necessary for troubleshooting what I need to examine (e.g. Routing, Latency, utilization)?
 I'm still gathering more information regarding the problem, but one thing I checked is the latency of the MSapplication which is only 100ms, and there is no jitter from the Analytics. No congestion as well. Since DIA is not an option right now, MPLS is our only choice.
 Thank you,
 ​

We'd like to set up load balancing and failover of the VPN connections by enabling VPN connections on 1 other office. I setup 2 dns records with our provider using their lb/failover option, which just requires specifying the desired DNS name, and the multiple IP addresses to use for lb/failover. It is working great, but I'm seeing a possible snag with SSL certs on the Meraki appliance. Is there any problem with creating 2 SSL certs, 1 for each office, which specify different host IP addresses, but the same DNS name? If a custom SSL cert is not used, AnyConnect gives a security pop-up message every time a user connects because it wants the Meraki Dynamic DNS name to be used for connection. Tried creating a cert with GoDaddy and it keeps giving me errors, and neither vendor seems to know what the issue is.

I'm looking at Zoom and RingCentral, and am hoping to get some feedback on either of these companies with respect to their phone system products.
 Background: We currently use Zoom for our videoconferencing needs, as well as our online classroom education. We've been pretty happy with them, and I'm leaning that direction because training would be minimal. Ring has a slick presentation, and it looks like they'd be about 30% cheaper.
 What has been your experience with either of these platforms, and how well did you like the service provided by the company involved when there were technical or administrative (read: billing) issues?
 Thanks!

Barracuda is currently failing entirely to block them, and each email is pretty distinct - however they all contain at least one line I was able to use to set up quarantining. I was attempting to set up quarantining for anything with an emoji in the subject, but barracuda's implementation of regex appears to be broken and they can't even figure it out. This has persisted for more than 24 hours and the volume is very, very high so I thought it was weird I couldn't find anyone else talking about this. 
 If you folks check your filters, do you see these getting caught? Or is anyone else seeing a flood of this exact email campaign slipping through?
 We also had some other unusual test-like emails slip through, and it makes me feel like we're in the midst of something highly targetted, but it's also.... very lazy. So on the one hand I am wondering if this is a bizarre targetted campaign that's just really sloppy, and on the other I'm wondering if this is just what AI spam is going to look like going forward, if it looks like trash to humans but was carefully trained to sneak around whatever email security the target is using.
 Replying to the emails sends an auto reply that sends you through a few URLs, but nothing seemed to be working or trying to do anything. https://imgur.com/a/Q825KHI

 I had to unzip ~500 1-4GB .7z files. Performing this task through the 7-Zip File Manager creates a batch job, running one at a time sequentially. Unzipping is CPU-limited, so it's going to take hours and hours to run. Running in a normal batch takes up 12% (1 of 8 cores, 100/8), there is plenty of power leftover.
 Powershell 7.3 introduces the -Parallel parameter for ForEach-Object, pretty useful and can massively speed things up. After some experimenting, I made some code that may be helpful to others.
 Note that this is for .7z files, installing the 7Zip4Powershell Module adds the command "Expand-7Zip". If you are using regular .zip files, use "Expand-Archive" and it's associated parameters.

If you don't want a folder created for each ZIP, and would prefer they be unzipped into the source directory, just use "$_". #For the ThrottleLimit parameter, set the number to the # of your CPU cores minus 1, otherwise it bogs down the machine.

 In a purely Link state routing protocol world, if a computer wants to send packets to a computer on another autonomous system, how would one routing table knows which router is closest to the other autonomous system?
 also, are ISPs just an enormous network operator with a gigantic routing table for all of their own routers? And when they say that autonomous systems communicate between each other to find the shortest path, do they keep a table of "cross system" paths or do they just communicate every time they need to know what's going on in another autonomous space? I hope I'm being clear.

 All right, I've had it with the shut down shenanigans! I instruct the users to restart their machines (most often these are laptop users) once they start having weird issues as that resolves a lot of those. I'm just tired of explaining to users (who want to be helpful by the way) that "Shutting it down and turning it on" is not the same as "Restarting". So I have situations where they would say they restarted as asked but uptime tells a different story. With that out of the way, what is the best way to make "Shut down" actually shut the machine down instead of hibernating it or whatever it's doing. Do I run "powercfg.exe /hibernate off" when building the machine? But then I'm not sure if Microsoft would turn it back on with one of their updates. Or would it be better through some group policy? or something else? I just want it permanently gone. What is your experience with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to create a list for new/junior engineers looking to grow. Any one else wish to add to my list, please feel free. What I am laying down are the rules taught to me by my mentor. An engineer who started with Cisco in 1989 and literally designed and oversaw Caterpillar/BMW/Mercedes etc etc etc global networks before he retired.
 Rule #1 Be hungry to learn. Every interaction, even after 30+ years of networking, is an opportunity to learn and grow. Being humble and hungry also makes you more desirable to work with!
 Rule #2 Lab. Even if you think you have the right answer, you are probably wrong if you haven't labbed! If you are learning something new, lab it up. Take packet captures to see if you get the expected packets. Learn to read said packets while in the lab. Never forget to lab.
 Rule #3 RFCs, RFCs, RFCs. Taking the time to look up an RFC is generally faster than contacting a consultant or vendor for a detailed answer. It is likely, they are going to read said RFC before replying back to you.
 Rule #4 Follow the packets. Our job revolves around moving packets from A-B or from C to D-K. Understand where a packet comes in from and why then where it is going to move to next and why. Do this node by node. Whether this is super basic VLAN only or the crazy complex Multicast over EVPN, following the path of the packet is a concept which will never die!
 Rule #5 When following the network path, draw out the topology. You may have 50 devices in your whole network but the packet for source to destination may only cross 4 devices. Understanding this will always greatly simply things and prevent a 4-day marathon of troubleshooting an issue. In most cases, shortens those sessions to just a few hours or less.
 Rule #6 See rule #1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I help maintain dnsReaper which is a subdomain takeover tool. It's free, available on GitHub and docker and looks for domains vulnerable to domain takeovers.
 Today we've added 2 new integrations!
 Project discovery have a massive database of subdomains called CHAOS and you can now query and test domains in dnsReaper.
 We've also added SecurityTrails, which also has a huge public subdomain list.
 This means that you can just point dnsReaper at a bug bounty domain and let it run. There will be false positives for sure, but we have 61 signatures so hopefully there will be some nice easy findings too.
 Our blog post on the new features is here:
 https://punksecurity.co.uk/blog/dnsreaper_pd/
 Our GitHub is over here:
 https://github.com/punk-security/dnsReaper
 It's a free tool that we built just to highlight this issue and educate. Please give it a star and share it, we'd appreciate it.

 I'm looking to build 2 servers to act as Active Directory domain controllers.
 A) I don't see many on-motherboard hardware RAID options for NVME SSDs. I see some expansion cards but wouldn't that mean they're sharing the same PCIe lane hurting throughput?
 B) Is there any way around buying 2 windows server licenses since one is only going to be a backup to the other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Our company has a mix of Windows and Linux & AIX machines. We patch all the Windows machines every month using PDQ, WSUS, and SCCM. However, we don't patch the Linux/AIX machines at all. I'm not a strong Linux person but I'm looking for information on how people manage the non-Windows based computers.
 Are there programs that can inventory and automate the process by sending patches to the machines that need them? Can I just send a command to every machine and they will install what they need? Can I specify only Security patches vs all patches? What options are there that I should look into?
 I'd prefer free tools but would consider paid ones if they are worth the cost. Our company is currently looking at BigFix because it can apparently patch every OS out there, but I've read a lot of things about how crazy expensive and complicated it is so if there's a better way to go, let me know.
 Thanks.

 I want to be able to primarily manage baseline configurations for Windows and Linux. For instance, check if certain services are running and if not start them. Centrally manage folder permissions and change them if they change. 
 Secondarily, patching. Ivanti is currently used for Windows patching and Ansible for Linux patching. Looking to maybe streamline that if possible.
 Any suggestions would be great. The product doesnt have to be FOSS, but certainly can be if its the right tool.

 Question for you folks, so let's say i have a site connected to my MPLS cloud with two or more circuits. What's the best way - best practice - to provide redundancy for the TE tunnels? 
 I have a team with quite sensitive application that requires minimal failover time. So trying to find best solution.
 I was thinking about creating separate tunnel interfaces with different explicit-path. But this solution seems to be hard to maintain. I'm probably missing something - help please.

 R2 & R3 have same AS 
 
After i established my bgp. All Routes from R2 & R3 are visible at R1 except the routes from R4 vice versa.

 Done the same with the actual remover tool from them as well, which prompted for the tamper protect pass, entered that , then failed to uninstall. Cool so i drag and drop it to the recycle bin, empty it and reboot. Cool looks gone
 Attempt to reinstall, installer and it states that installation failed, as "your system has the sophos endpoint product installed"
 So i cant uninstall, i cant reinstall. Anyone seen this

 ​
 I am reaching out in this sub as when I search for thin client issues or questions, this sub seems to appear the most on google.
 ​
 I am working on deploying an Hp T540 thin client as a kiosk to limit functionality to a specific site. We use windows configuration designer to provision a kiosk package for all versions of windows. 
 ​
 My colleague and I are running into an issue where when we run the kiosk package on the thin client and log into the account declared in the xml file (.\user), we can't log in. We enter the password, it says welcome, spins and then says signing out. We never get to the desktop. When we remove the kiosk package from the device, logged in as the local admin account, we are able to log back into .\user.
 ​
 I connected with HP and they were stumped on it, and my colleague says he checked through the registry and couldn't find anything.
 ​
 Do you all have any ideas of what could be the issue?

 I started at my current role with basically no knowledge, which I thought was made pretty clear during interviewing ect that i've built my own computer and feel confident enough with hardware related issues, but software/AD/troubleshooting is all new to me
 Anyway, I'm 8 months into my helpdesk role, have had basically no training a real sink or swim environment, while they haven't said anything bad about me, I just feel like I'm not doing good enough, 90% of the tickets I get I can't do or spend an hour googling how to do it. 
 Worst part is, people get paid less than me and know how to do 10x what I know, confuses me alot.
 I barley understand AD, I can barley setup local-admin accounts without getting confused or needing to confirm I'm doing it right, it's also an MSP so every clients setup is different, I don't understand basic networking like DCHP, DNS ect and I've tried to study, I've home labbed and I can set things up and fix things when following guides without a problem, the issue arises when I don't have a guide to follow. 
 Can anyone recommend some good study material for DNS, DHCP to understand them so I can get my head around it in different environments, sick of feeling stupid every single day.

 so they decided it be a good idea to have an autologin to generic account, with a move to 365 users are logging to teams and clicking the ''ok'' to sign into all apps as its more prominent in the menu.
 this then means upon login out of teams, that its now connected on the school or account so its logged in everywhere.
 I'm explaining this to them and asking for it to be removed and fix the root cause issue I mentioned earlier... (i've already asked about windows guest mode)
 ​
 ​
 they have come back and said below, can you let me know if this actually exists or are they out to lunch?
 ''
 if this is the case then most likely they have the single-use version of 365 rather than the shared switch which stops the saving of creds 
 log a call for any that you find and we can switch them over ''

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I am having a strange problem. DFS-R is replication files and folders and fully "in-sync". If I change, add, remove a file, everyting is working.
 ​
 But: If I rename a folder, the change is _sometimes_ replicated and _sometimes_ not or it takes a very long time, until the change is replicated.
 Get-DfsrBacklog does not show any pending changes for folder-renames.
 Changes of files INSIDE the non-rename-replicated-folder are changed fine.
 ​
 Did you ever see that behaviour and do you have any idea on how to fix this?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of information technology, data centers and their equipment play a pivotal role in supporting critical operations. At the heart of every data center lies the 19" server rack – a silent workhorse that has evolved significantly over the years. In this article, we take a journey through time to explore the history and technological advancements that have shaped 19" server racks into the indispensable components they are today.
 The Genesis of 19" Server Racks
 Back in the day, data centers looked nothing like the sleek facilities we see today. Those massive mainframes occupied entire rooms, leaving little space for anything else. Can you imagine that? As the need for better organization and efficient data management arose, the ingenious concept of server racks was born in the 1970s. But wait, there's more! The 19" width standard came into play, bringing order to the chaotic world of data centers and allowing different equipment to coexist peacefully in standardized enclosures.

 We are looking into MS Defender and JAMF Wandera Radar since we already have both licensed anyway.

Ideally we’d like to use Defender tho as we already have alerting, reporting and processes established around it.

 Wireless isn't my strong point (certainly not the layer 1 stuff - channels, frequencies, power etc). So I'm wondering how the pros would diagnose low level wireless issues? Specifically i'm talking about poor performance - dropouts, high latency, dropped packets etc) on a wireless network in an industrial environment.
 Are there specific hardware and software tools one would use to look at channel utilisations and that sort of thing?
 Any help is much appreciated.

Not really looking at jobs yet, just mainly brushing up on old subjects and equipment configs that i haven't done in awhile and a thought struck me. Now that we live in a post covid world, what is the outlook for Network engineers to be fully remote? At the beginning of 2021 i worked as a temp IT support tech for a few months for a local resort whose network support was located in a different state. Yes, the engineers would visit every now and again but mostly they would remote in whenever there was a problem or a need to. This resorts company had properties nation wide but their network support team was based in FL. I'm curious as to how common this type of arrangement is. Thanks for reading, look forward to all your comments.

All devices on the /24 have their own firewall, and are considered to be "on the public internet". I would like to use OSPF to distribute routes between these routers so that, for example, a laptop with a private IP behind Router 1 could print to a printer that has a private IP behind Router 2. 
 Am I correct in assuming that it would be a bad idea to use the interfaces associated with the public /24 for distributing routes via OSPF, because that would effectively be routing packets from internal devices over an un-trusted network? Or is this a non-issue and I am over-complicating it? I am currently planning on creating a new interface on each router with a new broadcast domain, purely for distributing routes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been super frustrated with my company and team lately. It's made me stressed, and quick to anger or annoyance. What's most frustrating is that I don't have any idea on how to fix the problem.
 I'm working on a large project, and management is trying to make all the technical decisions and keep teams in the dark with long term plans. I am generally leading the effort to implement the project.
 My coworkers cannot seem to stop shooting themselves in the foot. They also have an incredibly annoying habit of simply disagreeing with some inconsequential topic in what feels like an attempt to have some relevance in a conversation. They offer no substantive recommendations or contribution to the conversation - just that they disagree.
 I've made my concerns known to management about the proje…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I always thought traffic in a site to site VPN connection flowed through a tunnel on the same interface as the VPN... but the tunnel is built on 1 interface to agree on the phase 1 & 2 cryptography and to encrypt and decrypt the traffic with the keys. The 2nd interface is where the actual traffic flows back and forth between the private networks. So the traffic still goes through the internet normally on it's own interface, it's just encrypted and decrypted by the VPN interface as it comes and goes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey reddit. I'm looking for pointers setting up XV series wifi before I start please.
 I'll read the docs and tutorials, but I'd like to have an idea of what I'll be doing before I get started on them as to set my focus.
 My intended setup is pretty basic and for a small site:
  
Am looking at 4 or more XV series access points, will add more if needed.
 
Two SSIDs: one for the internal network VLAN and one for 'visitor wifi' VLAN.
 
WPA2 PSK Passphrase authentication.
 
SSID for internal network VLAN to be restricted by device / MAC address.
 
 Have registered with cnMaestro so I can start having a play before the access points arrive and it looks fairly intuitive.
 Any pointers and/or a brief rundown of what to expect would be appreciated, thank you.

 From the article:
 'Two years ago, ransomware crooks breached hardware-maker Gigabyte and dumped more than 112 gigabytes of data that included information from some of its most important supply-chain partners, including Intel and AMD. Now researchers are warning that the leaked information revealed what could amount to critical zero-day vulnerabilities that could imperil huge swaths of the computing world.
 The vulnerabilities reside inside firmware that Duluth, Georgia-based AMI makes for BMCs (baseboard management controllers). These tiny computers soldered into the motherboard of servers allow cloud centers, and sometimes their customers, to s…]]></summary>
