          "description": "Hi Reddit,\n I’m stumped on an issue. We’ve got a user account on the domain that should only be able to save to USB memory sticks, not able to save to their home drive or profile area (Desktop/Documents/Pictures/Videos/etc). I’ve got it sorted for their home drive but whatever I try they can still save to their profile area.\n I have tried applying Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> System Security -> File System. I’ve tried putting %UserProfile%\\Desktop and just Desktop. In GPResult I can see the policy is being applied and that it’s saying Deny Full Control but I am still able to create new files in that area. We just want a message box to say error or permission denied, something so that they cannot leave it there and log off.\n Any help appreciated please. Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/-TheComputerGuy-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Obviously filling the asset database with computer system information, their software etc. needs to be automated.\n I've audited and played with their discovery methods. Either it requires WMI or, PSSession w/ admin privileges, or custom made JEA session configuration. Obviously I was more interested in Just Enough Administration. Their rule capabilities file allows just for one custom made function which creates a script block with any lines of code you pass to it and then executes it in a separate workspace thus acting as pure privilege escalation.\n Digging deeper I've added logging of each and every payload they send into that function and they send a couple of their own PS modules, binaries, dlls, and even C# code which they compile on the fly. Apart from that they use wmic.exe to name a few.\n Do any of you have experience with ServiceNow and their Discovery solution, and does anyone think it's not a reason to be concerned? Is it a common practice to grant systemwide access to such solutions via PowerShell+JEA or should it be considered a major security concern?\n    submitted by    /u/ovdeathiam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I just discovered that our co-lo Cyxtera had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 2 months ago. The best part (in a cruel \"of course this happens to IT\" sort of way) is that my organization is currently in the middle of migrating its servers from company premises to their Toronto-based data center.\n We leased out racks at two separate Cyxtera locations for redundancy purposes. We decided to have both locations under Cyxtera to make it easier for us to manage our equipment but perhaps, we should have leased one location from Cyxtera and another location from another provider.\n I'm not too sure how to proceed and wanted to see what others' opinions are. Do we stay and just assume another data center company will scoop up Cyxtera and business as usual for us? Or should we diversify and seek out another Toronto-based company? Of course, the latter is attractive, but it's going to cost the business more (time, money, etc). I don't want to create unnecessary work for my team if this bankruptcy is going to have minimal impact. My hope is that another company scoops up Cyxtera; maybe they will change the portal for end-users, with little change here or there but nothing dramatic such as shutting down facilities, forcing us to scramble to find a new co-lo.\n For some context, we run the majority of our applications on-premise (mail, DB, in-house developed back-end apps, etc). Cloud would be too expensive for us. \n Like I said, looking for other pragmatic opinions. Maybe even some recommendation for co-location providers in the Toronto area (we're based in Mississauga)?\n EDIT: I may have not been clear. My business is a customer of Cyxtera. I do not work for Cyxtera.\n    submitted by    /u/canadian_stig  \n [link]   [comments]",

Enter current password, new password and confirmation of new password.\n They click the change password button and after a few seconds it comes back with \"Unable to change password\"\n They ARE meeting complexity requirements (I went as far as using the domain administrator password as a test.

My boss has entrusted me with the task of setting up internal signatures for all of our users, and while I've got the hang of external signatures, our CEO is keen on having the same functionality for internal communications.\n Now, here's where I could use your expertise: How can we go about achieving seamless internal signatures with Mimecast, mirroring the effectiveness of our external signatures? As far as I know, our external signatures are managed through Mimecast rather than Microsoft 365. Could we potentially explore the option of utilizing an additional third-party tool to streamline internal signatures?\n Your insights and recommendations would be immensely appreciated!

Maybe it's rare, but I think it's better safe than sorry and we only lose 2 minutes. On the other hand my colleague was thinking about the fact that we work remotely and adding delay time may lead to thoughts like \"it's broken/it won't power on\" etc. and more downtime for the customer.\n What are your thoughts? I couldn't find best practices about this and I was wondering if everyone just keeps it at 0 and risk it to avoid losing time\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/pcr_rpi  \n [link]   [comments]",

The file is active and so it constantly updating and being shared around the network. \n The way this was working initially was we had a NAS that hosted the file. Everyone would access the Nas and no file would be sorted on any of the pc’s. Recently we opened a branch in another country and so after talking to some network engineer from there he told us to get the MX68 for both sides of the network and to set up a site to site vpn to allow access for the other branch to the NAS and therefore allowing them to use the file as if they were in office.\n The struggle I’m having is the file will open here but not in the other branch. The latency of the vpn is +100ms. The internet speeds are a little affected and the ipsec policy apparently dosnt exist for this setup so we can’t see any computers on the other network. \n I think that the vpn is set up incorrectly but I’m not sure because I thought hiring a professional would not bring me this problem. \n Is this really a limitation of hardware or incompetent network engineer\n    submitted by    /u/inzz33  \n [link]   [comments]",

The new DC is already added to the environment, DNS and everything is setup and working. I'm not in a rush so I wanted to have both for a while until I am ready to migrate FSMO and then decommission the old DC.\n The AD environment still is heavily peppered with remnants of its origin in a 2003 SBS environment back when they had Exchange on-prem so there are GPOs and SG and all sorts of fun I'd never seen before. I thought I'd clean up some stuff in ADUC as it is not needed and the ADUC structure has OUs with no tiered structure and I'm moving everything around during this migration. I wish it were easy to just start over with a new clean Domain but it would be too much work as there's no RMM solution on the endpoints...\n TL;DR: I was cleaning up folders in ADUC and I deleted the \"Managed Service Accounts\" container... No backups, no snapshots... :( There was nothing in the folder which is why I deleted it before even thinking about it... How do I get it back?

If I have a family, we're going to struggle. (Look at Canadian real estate prices, particularly in Vancouver. A partner making the same as me wouldn't even be enough combined income for a one-bedroom condo.)\n Big picture life plan: I'd like the option of getting a TN-1 visa and going to the States, but my lack of diploma/degree in a related field means I wouldn't meet the educational requirements—plus lack of education makes me less marketable to US employers. So I'm looking at getting a diploma or maybe even degree online (TRU most likely). It would need to be online/flexible as I need to keep my day job. I couldn't afford to exist on student loans alone in today's Canadian rental market.\n Question: should I just completely forget about learning anything from Udemy courses (some of which I really like the look of), or could that realistically fill gaps that a formal education wouldn't?\n    submitted by    /u/BrightSign_nerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

The end user's machine was encrypted, fine, we'll do a OneDrive reset to the previous day. Or roll back the versions on the important files. When I started doing that, I noticed something terrifying: every version was encrypted. The original version might have been three years old, I restore it, encryption. I check the restore option, just gonna reset the whole thing. Before I do, I start looking at the files in the restore. The encryption was present throughout, weeks before the event occurred. \n Okay, maybe it's been on this PC for a while, patient zero, etc. So I go check our third party backups for 0365. Clean as a whistle. No sign of any encryption at all on the same files for the same date that the OneDrive reset is showing as bad. \n Called in a few outside resources to look at it, and they flipped. Have some pending reach out to some resources to better understand, mostly just making this post since I know a lot of people use OneDrive, don't trust Microsoft's verbiage of only the latest version can be affected by ransomware, appears to be patently false as of now (which I feel we all kind of expected but still).\n    submitted by    /u/Haloid1177  \n [link]   [comments]",

Far too large but that is still in place. Need a better solution)\n I started using Veeam Community Edition to replicate 4 of the 5 VMs from one host to the other, file server being the one not replicating.\n Also using Veeam to backup the file server twice a day to one of the NAS devices (320 GB). We would like to have that data replicated to the other two NAS devices. This is part of the issue, I can't seem to come up with a strategy that doesn't involve trying to transfer 2+ TB daily (bare metals) over a 100 Mbps connect (~1.8 days).\n The question: Do I just continue to replicate these VMs and keep the data separate? Trying to accommodate a quick recovery without transferring too much data. By the time 2 TB transfers over 100 Mbps, it's 2 days old when it gets there. Doing that AND the 320 GB just clogs the pipes.\n TL;DR; How do I get 8 Hyper-V machines and 320 GB of daily file backups from two sites backed up most efficiently without moving huge bare metal backups over 100 Mbps pipes to all three locations.

Despite forcing on the switch the speed from the switch, of the interface, that connects to the ESXI, the ESXI does not lift the network.\n Now the option we are considering is directly to the DC, with a laptop to connect from Ethernet to Ethernet, the ESXi card after the change was left in 1GB, and well most of the laptops today are 1GB.\n 1.- So we are thinking of doing that, a direct connection and make the adjustment via the HTML interface.\n 2.- Another one is to connect a keyboard and a screen and make the change from the yellow interface directly to the Esxi Host in DCUI, can you change from there?\n This server, this one from Lab, development. When it was installed, the interface, via esxi html web interface, does not give auto negotiation as an option, so I think this should only be configured via Esxi-shell, and set the interface to auto. Because from the web, it was only 10/100 and 1000, but not auto, From 100, I passed it to 1000 and then everything went to hell hehehe. The switch, its interface is in auto and the strange thing is that it only negotiated the connection at 100MBits, I feel that the network card of the server supports 1GB. That's why we changed it in the ESXi html to 1Gb and everything fell apart. \n Thanks for the good vibes, the time and the collaboration.\n What other options, suggestions, advice, comments could you tell me.\n Thanks\n I remain attentive\n Best regards\n    submitted by    /u/C3-PIO0ps  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there anything that can be run like sfc /scannow on a windows server and is it worth investing the time to find the issue and fix the server over building a new VM and then making it live. Maybe investigating the issues at a later date.\n Is there any software that can really help us understand when servers are suffering issues and have an understanding of what is happening. I find event viewer to be exceptionally difficult to siphon through to find actual issues.\n I’ve enabled more logging in the last few weeks but this doesn’t seem to be helping me find the issue.\n We are a fairly large company with the ability to spin up VMs fairly quickly, and the TSV would have our main application on it then office on top for users to use. The TSV application links back to the application server where all the SQL is done.\n Edit 1: We have a farm and broker setup ready but supposedly there are issues with roaming profiles on these servers.

Then there are the the Ethernet cables, I have a box of them that I should just purge as well. I have a drawer full of Ethernet cables brand new so I don't know why I hold onto this box of old cables.... Our office got new carpets and so everyone had to clean up their space.

I fully understand that endless questions from someone who can barely switch a monitor on without assistance and should know better by now are infuriating, but at least half of the people who work in my firm are technically competent; yet IT seem to hate us all (not openly, but you can sense the contempt). \n I’ve also caused bad blood with IT at work by pointing out security issues as well as problems with home built systems running slowly or glitchy. These problems are then fixed and clearly life is better for everyone, but IT clearly hate me for having raised them, and often won’t do anything until senior management have been roped in.\n There seems to be a holier than thou attitude and a feeling of ‘we’re really what makes this place run and you’re all idiots’ but at the end of the day, my emails, Word docs and MS teams calls are what pay their wages and what keeps the firm afloat. I also suspect that if computers were outlawed overnight, us lawyers would work out how to return to books, paper and typewriters very quickly.\n It seems to be purely an IT thing - I’ve never experienced this sort of attitude (to the same extent) from people who work in admin, accounts or any other function that is ancillary to the main business. My clients ask me tedious, repetitive questions, are occasionally rude and are often asking me to do hard, boring, often unnecessary (if they’d taken my earlier advice) mind numbing stuff I don’t really want to do, but I’m polite and obliging and never look down on any of them.\n FWIW, I’ve noticed this nearly everywhere I work and not just my current workplace.

Each week you will receive a lesson that contains a set of videos, some additional content, and some exercises. I will post solutions to the exercises online. The course is largely self-paced except for the weekly email cadence.\n ​\n Is there a lab environment?\n No, since this is a free course, there is no lab environment. For all of the lessons you should be able to accomplish the lessons without having any access to network devices.\n ​\n What are the prerequisites for the course?\n This course is intended for network engineers that have some basic familiarity with programming (for example, Perl, shell scripting, other language) and who would like to learn Python. The course covers Python fundamentals, but using examples and exercises that are more relevant to network engineers.\n ​\n Why Python?\n Python facilitates writing clean, readable code and is natively present on Linux and MacOS. Python has gained widespread support in the networking community both from engineers and from vendors. Python has a large, active community and, consequently, numerous resources are available to you (libraries, documentation, books, tutorials, etc.).\n ​\n What if I am unsatisfied with the course after I sign-up?\n The course is free so unsubscribe from the email-list if you aren't happy with the lessons or our other content.\n ​\n edit: formatting.\n    submitted by    /u/geebzor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sooooo, I got a customer who’s managing about 200 servers with WSUS. For years they had one person who’s only purpose it was to update all those servers one by one. Some water down the river, I took this over and wanted to implement 2 new GPO’s. One which is automatically downloading but not installing Server updates, the other one which is downloading and installing updated on Sunday at around 2am. So basically it doesn’t sound like a big deal. Now it comes… All serves starting from server 2012R2 till 2022 are completely ignoring the GPO. I have no clue why. Set up the “configure auto updates” policy. Once this didn’t work, I tried my luck with “scheduled maintenance” and some kinda hacky things that I found on the internet. Still, no luck… Servers are rebooting at any day of the week at any time of the day. Figured that maybe another policy is conflicting with mine, but no. Created a test server and put it top level of the domain. Not a single policy other than the default domain policy (which is empty) and my WSUS policy is applied to the server. The behavior is still the same. Once updates get detected, they get installed about an hour later and schedule a reboot for another hour later…\n Guess I’ll turn off the WSUS synchronization or at the the availability for all servers till next Sunday night or till I found a solution…\n    submitted by    /u/LordWolke  \n [link]   [comments]",

Im testing with a small group right now and superseded the old certifcate template, with a new one where autorenroll is enabled.\n The process itself works fine, all users got the new certificate. But after like 1-2 days some users already got the message again to update the certificate which i really dont understand. Its valid for 7 days, and renewal period is 3 days. So from my understanding popups for autoenroll should only start after 4 days.\n Im really going crazy with that, i checked all logs and the template but i have no idea why these popups are coming up after like 1-2 days. Does anyone maybye has an idea why this does not work out? The productive certificate will be valid for 365 days, but i really dont want to roll that out, as long as i dont understand the renewal period.\n    submitted by    /u/col0r93  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hoping I can get some feedback / guidance please. \n My objective is to set up a Dedicated server initially in the best and cheapest way, with the view as hopfully things grow, I can then get additional hardware as required. \n Currently I have a Dedicated server with OVH as follows ; \n Windows 2016 Server Standard, MSSQL 2017, 32GB, 2x2TB Drives, Plesk, Intel E3-1260 V6 \n My couple of user facing sites are Wordpress but the actual technology for the businesses are written in ASP using MSSQL. This all runs on the current server config mentioned. No Virtual Machines. \n My questions are along these lines ; \n a) should I set up a VM to run MSSQL (and or other things) or is it fine to just run everything as is off the one server environment.\n b) currently running the Intel E3-1260 V6 but I can move to Intel Xeon E-2136 as a special offer, for an extra $6 pm. Should I ? Is it worth the effort to migrate ?\n c) I am in Australia and the server is located in Canada. Lag is pretty bad. I can move to a server in India which is a new offering. Singapore might be another option. Does anyone have any feelings / suggestions as to whether it would be advantageous to move to OVH India as opposed to Canada as far as lag would be concerned ?\n That's all I can think of for now. \n Thanks in advance for any feedback / suggestions. \n Cheers\n ​\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Krammig  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am an 1st level IT-supporter on a daily basis and work mostly in RDP to our Management (and other) servers, at the same time that our Service Desk and file location is a Cloud solution. We are also using TeamViewer as our remote support tool. Cloud solutions are just becoming more and more relevant for everything.\n The Windows computer is therefore an overkill of a work tool as it costs a lot of money and requires a lot of maintenance + that you also get a work phone as well.\n I have the idea of only using a Samsung Galaxy S23 (or maybe S23 Ultra) as my primary work tool with DeX, which gives me the ability to work with a desktop, just like on a Windows. Then download Microsoft Remote Desktop App, PingTools Network Utilities and other relevant Apps that make my working day productive, smarter and funnier.\n Do you have any experience of working only with a Samsung Galaxy S23 phone (and maybe as an IT-supporter or Sys-admin)?

Each location also has 2 Synology units, one hosting all files and folder shares and second for backup. File and folder shares range between 500GB and 1.5TB organized mostly by dept. Over the last few years we migrated some \"easier\" departments from onprem to Teams/OneDrive. Once migrated users would simply go to Teams, their Team name, files and click on Sync and this would give users familiar access to files rather than accessing files through Teams interface. Apart from some occasional issues (mostly caused by Microsoft) we haven't had any real issues with this solution.\n We are running hybrid AD/AAD. Auto pilot deployments, MFA and conditional access have been implemented. Only domain joined equipment can access O365 environment.\n Now we are thinking of taking a plunge and simply migrating all sites and all departments. There are some debates over this as advantages are mostly for IT with few exceptions for end user, such as files are available anywhere, no need for VPN. \n There is also some chatter that storing files in Teams gives you better protection against crypto viruses but not sure how much and if true.\n We have also not considered any backup yet. Management is saying that 90 days is good enough because anything older than 90 days is useless anyway. \n Has anyone done something similar, pros and cons, ideas, real life best practices appart from Microsoft is suggesting.\n Also, we are small IT team, 2 ppl, one in NA and one in EU. Yes we do it all.\n    submitted by    /u/Cincar10900  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been in my current organization for over 15 years, starting from the help desk at Tier 1 and have moved up through the ranks over the years to eventually be where I am now, the network admin. I really enjoy what I do and from the IT side at least, the work is far more meaningful and significant. The role is of course much different though, I rarely directly interact with the staff and most of what I do, at least if it's done correctly, is completely transparent to anyone. The network is really just a utility at this point, no one ever notices it unless there's a problem. \n Doing some housekeeping on my (very) old files, I came across all of my work from back in the help desk days. It reminded me how things were much different back then, I interacted with pretty much all of the staff in the building regularly. The work I did, even though it was mundane nonsense like maintaining labs and carts, was completely visible. Since the help desk is the first point of contact for anything, I also worked directly with our tech time much closer than I do today. Unlike today, work back then was appreciated, even if it was something very basic because it directly helped someone. Many of the work relationships I built and the reputation I built came directly from the work I did back then. \n Maybe I'm just feeling overly nostalgic, but even though the work I do today is much more rewarding on the IT side and the pay is obviously much better, it kind of feels like everything else is worse and it leaves me missing those days and interactions. Am I just crazy or does anyone else who made this same journey feel the same?\n    submitted by    /u/vtvincent  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently was encouraged to deploy an on-prem server both in-house, and for one of our clients. I muddled my way through, and learned a lot, but I should have been better prepared. In light of that realization, I started looking into MS Certs. I don't see any Certs listed for on-prem environments. Lots of Cert for Azure, and a few for Hybrid, but not for on-prem only, that I could find.\n So the questions:\n Are there still Cert tracks for on-prem environments?\n Does it matter?\n Should I just follow the Azure Cert tracks? \n For some additional background: I used Windows XP extensively, in my early teen years. I then switched to Mac for ~1 year, then switched to Linux. I have been primarily using Linux (Arch, FTW) for over a decade, up until this most recent job role, (about 2 years in my current role) when I gradually transitioned to using Windows again. I've been diving into Powershell very heavily (Windows finally has a usable CLI??) I also purchased \"Deploying and Managing Active Directory with Windows PowerShell: Tools for cloud-based and hybrid environments\" and read most of it, and continue to use it heavily as a reference book.

Currently, we have three separate sites, each with its own fiber internet connection and an elan for inter-site traffic.\n I'm considering the possibility of consolidating our setup so that the second and third sites access the internet through the first site's connection. This would mean relying on the elan to connect the sites and having one central firewall. \n There seem to be various pros and cons to this approach. On the positive side, we'd benefit from increased bandwidth at the larger site and potentially simplify our internet management. On the flip side, there's the concern of a single point of failure and the potential for one site to consume too much bandwidth.\n I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter.

It tells them that higher elevation is needed.

I'm trying to set up everything correctly, so there's no problem in the future.\n  \nOur users need to access their desktop computers that stay in the office. Is it okay to only run the Gateway, and let the users connect through that? My understanding is that I need the connection broker and the session host only if people will be connecting to a special RDS host.\n How does license assignment work in case of only using the Gateway? Do I even need the CAL's? Because I've tried a few connections, and even though the CAL's are installed, they aren't being assigned to users, despite multiple different connections.\n Is it possible to use something like DUO for MFA over RD Gateway, but not require people to use it when in the office, in front of their computers?\n Is there any cheap (preferably free?) way of monitoring and reporting on the sessions?

For few weeks now, my monitor doesn't go to sleep anymore when I lock my PC. Usually I would use Win + L, and monitor would go to sleep after about 1 minute.\n Now for some reason monitor never goes to sleep. I already checked all the basic things with power settings etc. but in the end I found \"powercfg /requests\" command that shows what is preventing my monitor from entering sleep mode:\n PS C:\\> powercfg /requests \n DISPLAY: [PROCESS] \\Device\\HarddiskVolume5\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\RegAsm.exe\n SYSTEM: [PROCESS] \\Device\\HarddiskVolume5\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\RegAsm.exe\n AWAYMODE: None.\n EXECUTION: [PROCESS] \\Device\\HarddiskVolume5\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe Playing audio\n PERFBOOST: None.\n ACTIVELOCKSCREEN: None.\n Lets ignore msedge.exe, since it's running right now and playing music. But even if I close all programs on my PC, there will be still RegAsm.exe running in background and preventing my monitor to sleep. I also checked in task manager, and I can see RegAsm.exe running. When I ended this process, my monitor went to sleep after locking computer, but it came back on in few minutes. Once again RegAsm.exe was running.\n Anyone experienced same problem like me? Any suggestions how to check what's actually using this process and how to get rid of it for good?\n    submitted by    /u/Simon771  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Guys,\n I had a question I wanted to know if anyone had the answer to regarding the New Outlook Desktop. \n We upgrade our client’s Outlook Desktop client to the new version of Outlook, which looks more like the web version. The reason was that they use Google Gsuite for emailing, and for some reason, their Gmail account wasn’t connecting properly with Outlook desktop. However, they have multiple email accounts and are used to be able to drag emails from folders in one account to a folder in another account. However, with New Outlook Desktop, they can’t do that.\n So my question would anyone know how to do that, or if anyone knows how to fix Outlook Desktop to connect to a Google Guite Gmail account? (Every time we connect it, it says can’t connect to the server and doesn’t sync. But the New Outlook Desktop syncs perfectly.)\n Thank You!! \n    submitted by    /u/SecureCPU  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has a static IP on the network.\n Computers are configured with it as a network printer and it works great - until it doesn't. Occasionally (couple times a month), someone will lose the ability to print. They try to print a document, the printer makes the usual noises (fans coming on as it wakes from sleep, etc), but nothing comes out. The computer thinks it sent the document, so there's nothing left in the queue. \n The only fix I've found is to remove the printer device from their computer and re-add it as a network printer. Only takes a moment, but it's a pain since usually they printed a bunch of stuff before noticing that nothing came out and now they have to figure out what they tried to print. \n Given that remove/readd on the computer fixes it, I think it's a driver/windows issue rather than the printer itself. However, it only happens to 2 users. All the rest of the office has never had this happen. It's possible that it's just because they're heavier printer users, but not sure. \n Any ideas of where to bang my head on next? I've tried installing the full Lexmark printer driver, but that takes FOREVER and doesn't help. Now I just add it as a network printer from the Windows add device process, put in the IP address, and let Windows use a basic printer driver. It's quicker and doesn't seem to matter. \n update: hm, I'm not sure if I've tried just restarting the spooler service.

But our lawyers are crafty and write the contracts with an incredibly narrow scope for what defines 6 9's. Our IT metrics for SLA only look at a very narrow part of the system so we can say it's the Internet or 3pp if (when) a customer complains we missed SLA. We've got elaborate monitoring setup to provide evidence to customers when they push the issue to show them it's not the system. Of course real SLA at the edge would be closer to 99.99%\n I really get tired of having to do that and just wish they'd let us start building a replacement.

A colleague of mine recently recalled an email and then was unable to access the message recall report.

The argument was made (and won) that all operatory stations are behind locked doors and that there \"should\" be no danger of exposing PII or PHI except to other healthcare staff.\n to streamline this more we are about to transition these into MEM/Intune policies with some device filters to separate that 15 minute PCs and 30 minute PCs.\n I'm just curious overall how complex people get with screen lock policies like this or if it really should just be this simple.\n    submitted by    /u/stray_demon_723  \n [link]   [comments]",

The file share is being moved to Server2. The problem I am facing is the application on Server 1 is accessed using the server name (so that server name cannot change and needs to remain). The file share is mapped via GPO, but there are numerous links/pinned folders to that share done via the UNC path (due to the way some of their applications function and end users being end users).\n Is there anyway that I can have \\\\Server1\\File Share \"redirect\" to \\\\Server2\\File Share? (like with symbolic links or something). Keep in mind, DFS won't help, adding a secondary UNC name to Server2 can't happen (because Server 1 needs to be accessed for an application).\n I am going to be rolling this out as DFS moving forward, but that won't help me in this instance.\n As I said, I did Google, Search Reddit, Spiceworks, etc...

We then setup WHfB using a PIN and our own mobile number, then change the authentication number to the new users phone number. We don’t provide the password to the users - part of our post enrolment tasks is to ensure all apps are logged in correctly. \n This works very well for us and whilst improvements can and should be made so we don’t have to do this setup, management are not looking to change this anytime soon. \n What falls down is when an existing user needs a replacement device and we need to log in on a new laptop. We have to reset the password which causes disruption to the end user as they are prompted for their new password on their current laptop and phone, which we then have to tell them - what we were actively avoiding in the first place. \n From what I’ve read, a temporary access pass only works for enrolment and isn’t a solution for the end users existing laptop and phone in this situation. \n Is there any solution to this where the end user doesn’t know and isn’t required to enter in a password? IT knowing the passwords for users isn’t a concern. \n (I’m aware this is not close to best practice in any means, but management are unfortunately only looking for a solution to minimise the end user disruption at this point)\n    submitted by    /u/bsmpsn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am unable to see anything of meaningful in event viewer, but that could just be that im looking in the wrong places.\n This does not happen if the user is directly created in AAD.\n The issues usually goes away if the user profile on the device is deleted, but not all the time. A fresh start will guarantee the issue to go away since everything on the device gets removed, hence user profile is fully gone.\n However, as we use a fair bit of shared device a user may end up logging into 10s of devices, which can be quite the cleanup job to get the user fully working again on all the computers he/she might use. \n Any suggestions to solve this without going through deleting the user profiles pr. device? :)\n    submitted by    /u/Hamberget  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope someone can provide additional ideas to help me resolve this issue.\n Here's the situation:\n In our IT department, we've moved approximately 140 VMs from one VM cluster to a new one as part of a hardware replacement.\n For some unknown reason, the C: drive of several random VMs has completely filled up after the move. Upon inspecting the C: drives, it seems that the \"C:\\Windows\\WinSXS\\Temp\\InFlight\" directory has suddenly consumed all available space on some VMs, taking up more than 80GB.\n Here's what I've tried so far:\n - Running the Disk Cleanup tool (cleanmgr.exe) and selecting all available options in the GUI.\n - Executing all possible WinSXS cleanup commands, such as \"schtasks.exe /Run /TN \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Servicing\\StartComponentCleanup\"\", \"Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup\", \"Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase\", and \"Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded\".\n - Restarting the system multiple times.\n Despite these attempts, I've been unable to reduce the size or get rid of these files. I'm at a loss as to why they were created, especially at such a size, and why only some random VMs were affected.\n I would truly appreciate any additional insights or suggestions on what I could try to resolve this issue.

          "description": "Hi all. I hope you are doing great.\n Nowadays, which are the best and most recommended external storage options to have a complete backup of personal cloud (Google Drive or OneDrive) considering frequency to upload data can be each 2 weeks or monthly. The main goal is to not going under risk to loose personal data from the cloud provider, since I was a victim of this in the past by Google when they removed several photo albums (and their contents), I opened a support request asking for reason and to recover and in the end I lost everything they removed suddenly without a reason and explanation to me as a customer who pay annual subscription. So, after that irrecoverable damage, I will migrate all cloud data (mainly from Drive and Photos) to MS OneDrive (I have M365 Personal subscription). I'm IT Pro by 25 years, however, I don't buy any external storage a long time ago, so I'm not updated to the newest tech available and don't know the major advantages and disadvantages comparing HDD with SSD for instance to achieve this goal. Based on some articles which I read, for backup it seems HDD is better and recommended than SSD because the HDD lifetime is greater and more secure, but I have doubts. I don't care about the transfer speed because the data transfer frequency will be low. It's crucial to have a mirror of the data in case of any problems in cloud provider (MS in this case) and to not run in risk to loose my data again. I was thinking in buy 2.5\" size (portable models) with between 1 and 5TB of space and manufactures as Seagate and Western Digital.\n What are your recommendations, tips and advices to do the the best buying taking into considerations the factors and goal above?\n Thanks in advance! \n Kind regards.\n    submitted by    /u/marcosgdias  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fully remote, outside IR35, £600+ day rates with job specs that are pretty much my current job description. \n I earn enough money at the moment to max out my ISA each year and have plenty left over to live. But I can't resist the \"What If?\" temptation. I have a 3 month notice period currently, so if I were to take the plunge, I'd have to hand my notice in first and then search for contracts after, as no client is willing to wait 3 months for me to become available.\n Equally, having said that, I tend to get bored with jobs after about 9 months anyway. Once there's no proactive problems to fix and my day becomes more about BAU, I get itchy feet. Also, my current job has awful benefits and a 24/7 on call policy which is very detrimental to my health and relationship.\n The thought of leaving my very secure, very well paying (70k GBP) job, with nothing else lined up, absolutely petrifies me. My imposter syndrome is telling me that I'd never find work, and then never find a similar paying job once I have to come crawling back to perm with my tail between my legs. Setting up a limited company, hiring an accountant, etc. Spending thousands and putting all that effort in...\n I have enough savings to last a year or so with no income, but is it worth the risk?

Would it make sense to have two IaaS DCs in Azure, this is just so the identities would be hybrid, nothing would change authentication wise as we would use PHS, and our physical devices still remain AAD joined. \n A few benefits here: \n We can leverage AAD Kerberos with Azure Files and benefit there by finally having the option to utilize ACL permissions on an AAD joined machine. No line of sight to DC required \n Windows 365 HAADJ Is seamless, PRT token, Hybrid joined and enrolled prelogon. AAD join is also an option. \n The ability to use FsLogix securely via Kerberos tickets, no access keys. \n Ability to Hybrid Join virtual machines and auto enroll them in intune, previously with AADDS, a lot of the VMs weren’t supported for Intune enrollment with AVD. \n Our Vendor had us make 1,000 groups in AADDS and they had to be in specific OUs, so we couldn’t create them from Azure and sync them back to the Root of AADDS, therefore there is no way to sync these groups back to Azure without hybrid AD and not just the AADDS offering. \n I don’t really see a point of using AADDS when onprem ADDS is far capable of more and we don’t really lose anything.

I found this: Intel VROC and (shame on me) i installed it on my windows server 2022...\n Now, after the restart, windows does not want to launch anymore and shows me the repair page and it seems that i no longer see the volume in RAID5 as if it no longer existed while in the F3 menu i can clearly see my 2 volumes ready. \n I confess that i don't understand much about it. Anyone know if this is definitetly dead and i have to reinstall everything Or if i can find my volumes as before? I've readed some documentation but i find nothing and this is difficult because english is not my mother language. \n Thank you very much for reading me and thank you very much to those who can enlighten me on the subject.\n    submitted by    /u/Gouje22  \n [link]   [comments]",

When adding the second migrated node, the node is correctly added and we can see correct voting, but a problem starts where HyperV services become unresponsive and we start to see cluster events where CSV volumes fail and DCM handling volume unmap reports appear.\n We tested and every node can connect to the CSVs on their own. Our feeling is that it might be network related, but we are using the same network connections as before as well.\n As anyone seen this before?\n Best Regards\n    submitted by    /u/rawrtherapyatwork  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We've put a lot of work into reducing our vulnerabilities but one area where we're hurting is Microsoft SQL and Apache/Tomcat vulnerabilities. The reason it's this way because what happens is an outside vendor comes in and installs their software which usually has SQL and Apache/Tomcat and then it's hands off. The team knows nothing about maintaining those applications so it's more of a leave them alone type of thing. To be honest it seems most of the team could care less about vulnerabilities as a whole and the only time anyone does care is management when an audit comes around. I feel the attitude is \"they're internal to our network. If someone exploits those that means their inside and we have bigger problems.\"\n Is Apache/Tomcat as bad as our team makes out to keep current? Is it just an upgrade over the top that's easy/peasy? As for SQL it's usually nothing more than a service pack goes end-of-life or more so the version goes end-of-life. As I said the attitude is leave it alone because we don't know if upgrading it from SQL 17 TO 19 will break anything. \n Anyway, I'm getting tired of staring at those usually high level vulnerabilities with nothing being done about them. I want to ask my management if we can just mark them as accepted risks if we're never going to do anything so I can get them out of my face. Any input would be appreciated about these applications.

          "description": "Years ago when I was at the helpdesk, I had near constant conflicts with a server admin. It began when the admin found out I was gay, and our work relationship went downhill quickly after that. Over the years, neither of us trusted the others work. It escalated to the point the admin directly made accusations of \"hacking\" one of the privileged accounts to log into a server, only hours later to find out it was another admin on his team who used that account. These types of accusations (directly and indirectly) continued over the years until he left the organization a few years ago. \n ​\n Just to address these accusations, none of them stuck to the wall, and only one case did a manager even question whether the accusation was accurate. I have a 100% clean record.\n ​\n Since that time, a complete staff turnover and expansion of the server team brought in new people, and I have moved into a desktop admin position. Unfortunately, I have heard of some of these previous accusations from the new staff, which I am realizing now, has damaged my credibility. One of the managers who left our organization believes the harm of the accusations from the previous admin has poisoned the work relationship with the new staff and it'd be best to leave.\n ​\n I do believe the best option is to leave. I would prefer to stay. Are there any suggestions on how to recover from a damaged reputation? In hindsight, I should have addressed this immediate with management, but I took the approach of trying not to escalate the situation. Letting it linger this long clearly was a mistake.\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ChompChompBandit  \n [link]   [comments]",

All machines are dumb desktops running Windows 10 LTSC with RDP shortcuts to virtual control screens, so you can easily switch out hardware.\n One control system was running Windows XP (welcome to industrial life) and every 10 minutes the RDP session would drop. No explanation or warning, would just vanish. This didn't happen on the desktops RDPing to more modern OSs. Tried to comb through event logs for a week, with no indication as to what was happening.\n Eventually resorted to running a WireShark capture on both the client and control system, and captured some funny ARP requests the moment the sessions dropped.\n It turned out that a switch had an SVI onto the network the PCs and control system sat on, but whilst this was supposed to be a /23 network, the switch's VLAN interface was configured as a /24. That meant every time the PC sent out an ARP request for the control system, the switch would \"helpfully\" try and act as an ARP forwarder, as the address was the \"other side\" of the /23, which the switch knew wasn't on its network.

          "description": "Hi. I know this post isn't traditional sysadmin stuff. Our police dispatch center uses Intrado Viper with 7-digit Frontier Centranet lines. Right now all inbound calls to our dispatch center that come from AT&T wireless or any voip providers are staticky. Outbound calls are fine. Calls from Verizon wireless are fine. Calls from other Frontier Centranet lines are fine. You might think this is an issue with Viper except we have a second non-police location that has a interactive voice response system that is also having issues and it too uses frontier Centranet lines. Frontier came out earlier today and decided the issue wasn't theirs and closed a couple of tickets and said they would return on Monday to continue investgating. The problem is our police dispatch center cannot wait until Monday -we need to get a dispatch now and I've had no luck getting anybody to come out. Anyone else ever run into this issue?

He specifically stated that he's been using windows 7 since its inception and that it's the last enterprise worthy OS release from Microsoft, and that he believes windows 10 is more about advertising and selling user data than being an enterprise/business oriented OS offering. \n He claims he came from the security sector and that they were able to accommodate him at his last job with a Windows 7 machine, and that that place \"was like fort Knox\", and that with a good anti virus and zero trust/least privilege there should be no concern using it over windows 10. \n At first I didn't know what to think.. I began downloading windows 7 updates in WSUS to accommodate the request. Then I thought about it more, and I think it's a lose lose for me. If I don't accommodate, I'm ruffling the feathers of the new CEO and could be replaced as a result. If I do, and it causes some sort of security breach, my job is on the line.

We had maybe half of the computers have uptime over 7 days, and a third over 14 days. \n Problem 1 fix - I created a task a couple of years ago in PDQ, but have moved to Ninja, to create pop-ups using the msg.exe stating your computer's uptime is more than X days! Please reboot.\n Problem 2 - Now we only have about 30-50 computers that have over 18 days uptime. \n Opinion - I think the best course of action would be to force shut down the computer after 4 days (4 days for the reason of the weekend, month end, payroll, etc...) and have a pop-up counter every now and then showing it's going to happen. I was going to run a shutdown /s /t 345600, but I'm unsure how to make a pop-up with the date or time of the force reboot. It does do a pop up when executed and when there are I think 5 or 2 minutes left. I could make a different pop-up at noon, for people at 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, and 22 days, with a comment of the reboot will happen in X days at noon (X hours) and possibly -a the previous shutdown command. \n Why? - We have seen a large reduction in tickets from these pop-ups, and fewer complaints about stuff being slow.

          "description": "Hi,\n So I was wondering what SMTP service people are using as I am scouting for alternatives. \n We are currently using Sendgrid SaaS through Azure and relay mails through a hosted SMTP server to Sendgrid. This is mostly because most of the printers we use do not support passwords longer than 64 characters so the sendgrid API key wont work. We use IP whitelisting instead of authentication ( not the best solution i know)\n  \n However, we are growing and more services are using the Sendgrid tenant. Some systems that use this have supporters that would like access to check the mail logs for these services, however, since all the domains are in the same service, and there is no way of restricting ther access to certain domains ( as far as i know) it is starting to become a pain in the ass.\n Thought about setting up a seperate SendGrid for these services, but then DKIM and DMARC will be acting up.\n  \n What is everyone else using and what can you recommend?\n Basically looking for something that supports basic auth or ip whitelisting for printers, or relay from SMTP and where we can delegate access based on domain and/or service.\n    submitted by    /u/gahd95  \n [link]   [comments]",

My Manager was very knowledgeable and taught me a lot about the general day to day of doing support.\n After about 9 months, the Manager went on sick leave, which was fine at first as there had been times where I was on my own for the day to cover annual leave/weekends etc. After a week of him being on sick leave and completely out of communication I was starting to get concerned as even though I was handling my day to day tasks, I was starting to get more questions that I had no idea about, and would usually pass up to the Manager. I had to very quickly learn how to manage all of the IT requirements for the college, updating business critical software, dealing with suppliers, deciding on purchases, managing the IT budget etc. \n The Manager never came back from his sick leave, I only saw him 1 more time about a year later when he came in to collect some stuff. I ended up being a 1 person IT department for 9 years and was very comfortable doing that role. The only reason I left is because the college merged with another larger college and I would have had to become a smaller role in a 6 person IT department, which felt like a step backwards.\n    submitted by    /u/pfrary  \n [link]   [comments]",

They can go to the external IP and it resolves to a cisco page (X.X.X.X/+CSCOE+/logon.html). If you have credentials for that portal, you can download the Cisco Anyconnect client. I went to an external network and tried it.

I kept it pretty brief for LinkedIn sake, but if anyone does have some laptops, they'd be happy to donate to get repurposed for foster Kids in the Denver area, I would gladly take them and send you a tax write off letter for your trouble. \n Linkedin Post: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090341579864903680/\n FAQ (for IT people): \n  \nYes, we are happy to take laptops without hard drives. \n We cannot take desktops as foster kids move around a lot and this makes it hard for them to transport, but I can connect you with a charity that does if you'd like.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Just-one-more-Dad  \n [link]   [comments]",

The users get the following error message:\n \"Microsoft Windows Network: The local device name is already in use. This connection has not been restored.\"\n The mapped drives are shares on a Windows Server 2022 and are connected to the clients via GPO. The users connect to our company network with the Watchguard SSL Client. The drives work without any problems for everyone inside our company network, but not when connected via VPN. When i try to connect to the Server manually it works just fine. At the moment i gave the users a script, which removes all NetDrives and connects them again. The wierd thing is it works sometimes for some users, what makes me think its some kind of DNS error. I would appreciate every tip i can get, thanks. \n    submitted by    /u/AlexKGB_R  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was hired last year to be the principal engineer over a local on prem env along with cloud engineer duties. The on prem really is a simple env and doesn't take much time but internal Infra does fall under it. They needed a dedicated person to \"run point\". \n We have an MSP they've used for years and they are really good most of the time. Their head engineer passed away. He was who I worked with most.\n My boss and the CTO want to roll out Intune since we're 365 and our licenses are right. \n I'm in the very early stages of building policies and testing them. They want the initial policies simple and aimed at mobile devices. So IOS and Android.\n I created an Android policy, tested it on my phone, and made notes.\n I went to create a Conditional Access Policy and didn't have the rights. So I reached out to ask for them. \n The engineer called me and made me second guess myself. He wanted to knkw why I needed a conditional access policy and not just a device policy.\n And I still don't understand the question or logic behind it. Because if I create Device Policies but not Conditional Access Policy - there would be nothing in place to force people to enroll their devices. The device policies would be pointless.\n Maybe he didn't understand I was testing. But I said the word testing multiple times.\n Am I nuts? I need a Conditional access Polocy or it's all moot, correct?\n If I want to not allow users to be able to use say 365 apps on their phone unless their device is enrolled and compliant - I need a conditional access policy forcing them to enroll their device.\n I think I'm just fried for the day and need to take off early and reset. Because this seems like a no brainer to me.\n    submitted by    /u/IWasAroundIWasAround  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was able to learn a lot within that year, but after he left the company, I felt like I started to stagnate. The management was also god-awful, and wanted to get out ASAP. \n I left the company earlier this year and got a job as desktop support that pays me almost double what I was making at the old place. I feel I'm making much more than what is typical for this kind of position, especially considering I'm doing far less than I was at my previous job. \n I'm happy about getting a livable wage, but it feels like I'm hurting myself more in the long run by taking the de facto \"demotion\". Nothing I've done in the past month or so of being here is something I couldn't teach my mom how to do in a few hours. \n Any thoughts regarding this? \n TL;DR: I'm making more money, but feel like I'm wasting time not increasing the value of my resume. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/gutenshmeis  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm referring to like, bigger issues related to ALL HP printers with a certain firmware / model, or maybe a new Windows bug like AppReadiness slowing logins. It doesn't affect everyone but maybe it should be noted somewhere in case someone runs into this issue or maybe it should be posted because it needs someone to keep an eye on it, like in the case of a 'laravel.log' growing to be way to big, which might require someone to manually move that file(s) elsewhere.\n Just wondering.

As much as I despise the app (as compared to other wikis), I like the idea of one company-wide IT central point of knowledge. We're a large Enterprise IT shop and there are lots of teams I need to interact with, each with their own procedures and methods of engagement. With each one having their own Confluence space, I now go to one place to search for documentation.\n But no one seems to understand the concept of a wiki. In a wiki you LINK TO OTHER PAGES. So, when you're trying to document the process you go to to build a new Azure VM, you should link to the Azure provisioning team, and not create your own documentation. Cause whatever you have might be out of date very quickly.\n So, now I go to Confluence and search \"provision Azure SLES VM\" and I get 20 different pages that come up, some defining of procedure that went out of date 2 YEARS AGO.\n I went through my teams Wiki and removed any documentation that didn't involve something my team does, and replaced it with links to documentation from the team that does that work.

Since this was my first real experience in the IT industry (I did an internship as a Help Desk Technician for another company for a year), I was pretty excited at first, but after a year and a half, I noticed that I spent most of my time troubleshooting common user problems (e.g. resetting domain and/or e-mail passwords, setting up PCs, etc.); there were also times when I did actual System Administrator work (e.g. setting up a firewall, setting up and checking on backup activities, etc.), but those times were extremely rare (even now). I've also noticed a lot of internal problems which were brought up but never fixed can be listed as follows:\n - All of us are forced to use personal phones for work; after bringing such a thing up both my boss and management explicitly told me that if I don't like it, I can always buy a new phone that I can use for work at my own expense.\n - At the same time, both my boss and management adore splurging money on parties and other such things.\n - As soon as work is lightly inconvenient everyone expects me to deal with it.\n - They also expect me to both clean other people's messes AND do my job at the same time.\n - All of the things I've learned so far I've learned on my own (except for a few things).\n - Whenever I try to complain about those problems with my boss or management I'm met with empty promises.\n Should I keep going?

(\\\\Print Server Name\\Printer Name)\n <add key=\"printServerPrinter\" value=\"\\\\APPS-UATSVR\\NPIFBCC54 (HP LaserJet MFP M430)\"/>\n This program works when I run it on visual studio or even when I release it and run it via its .exe file. It has to run during work hours so I added it to Task Scheduler to start it to check something every minute and print when it found something. \n The problem is if the program is started by the Task Scheduler It couldn't find the printer, it generates a pdf but can't send it to print on the printer since it couldnt find/open it. This is the error logged on a .txt file.\n 2023-07-26 06:32:43:751191 Function:Main - Message:The printer named \"\\\\APPS-UATSVR\\NPIFBCC54 (HP LaserJet MFP M430)\" could not be opened. Error code: 0\n If I start it normally there are no problems, as I have said earlier. I searched around the net but couldn't find an answer and i can't seem to debug this problem. I've tried many ways, changed the printer name, changed the port, change the backslash to forward slash but it still wont work.\n What seems to be the problem?

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n so I'm sitting at work, and you know how ones workplace evolves over time. So by this time I'm sitting in front of three screens plus open notebook (17 inch). For various reasons I've got one workstation connected to two screens while my notebook gets one extra screen. Additionaly I've got a 65' UHD screen in here as well, for monitoring and the occasional meeting. Some other stuff with screen outputs on my desk as well, not connected permanently but only if needed.\n So as you can guess, things get messy quickly. I was thinking about getting something like this: https://www.purelink.de/en/switcher-matrices/hdmi/3431/4x4-4k-18gbps-hdmi-matrix-with-scaler-and-audio-matrix to switch between the screens because it leaves me with way more flexibility than any standard kvm switch I found, as those either don't come as a matrix switcher or don't do multi screen setups well. Then I might combine that with some kind of USB Switch.\n My question to you guys is, has anyone run something like this? Any recommendations for multi screen, multi PC setups? Happy to hear any thoughts on my setup, also very interested in how everyone else has their desk setup!\n    submitted by    /u/allnamesaretaken6  \n [link]   [comments]",

They ask us to return our equipment like laptop etc and also the ID office card which it doesnt make sense if its supposed to be a temporary lay off. Not to mention that they have closed our email accounts etc.\n So my question is how to handle this? Is there a way that we can still push back for compensation packages or something?\n I guess since they wont pay us anymore the only leverage that we have is not return the equipment and make a scene asking either for a proper lay off with compensation package and paid the untaken holidays or well a real temporary lay off where we keep the equipment till a new client comes?\n    submitted by    /u/Felix1178  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've recently labbed setting up a RDGW at home, so was quite pleased to get this. \n I set up CAPs & RAPs and AD Security Groups to point at them, added the PC and the user to the correct AD groups and then added him to the remote desktop users local group on his PC (I know I should do this via GP really, but wanted to get it sorted). Tested with an admin account and it worked. Sent the user a shortcut and it doesn't work.\n Spent several hours going crazy, checking and double checking what I'd set up. Relaxed the CAPs and RAPs to test. Compared it to other clients. Wondering what really obvious thing I've missed. At this point he's given me his AD password, so I test without the gateway from my PC using VPN. It works, but it's not a solution for him as he doesn't have the VPN.

Done the testing, all good, but I have 2 issues. First, I have to somehow \"sell\" this switch to the client (as in why this is better than the current setup) and what I'm thinking is 1. benefits of conditional access, 2. logs in only one place and 3. availability, if the radius server somehow goes offline it's bye bye ssl vpn for the users right now. Are there any other advantages that I could mention? \n Secondly, I have to find a way to do this as \"silent\" as I can so the users are not...bothered. I know I could do a step by step tutorial and let them modify the existing connection profile but this is not an option. Manually doing it myself remotely is also not an option, there are almost 400 users. What I tought about so far was Intune, but this would work only if I push the full Forticlient app, so it would be a reinstall/upgrade, it needs reboot and so on. Also, I thought about just pushing the configuration via gpo, but I have no idea if the Forticlient connection settings are stored in the registry, or in some file. Any better ideas here?\n Thank you! :)\n    submitted by    /u/SalamanderAccurate18  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyway, I couldn’t really sleep last night and I spoke to my boss this morning. \n First thing he said was that he thought it was going to be worse, lol. He also said that when I’m gone for a week, he forgets to check Mimecast or when I’m not in on Fridays, and that it’s not completely my fault as he never even warned me about the 48 hour thing when he showed me the system. Anyway, I think part of it was probs trying to make me feel better but I took full accountability for it, as I said that I would. He said it isn’t a massive issue, and we just talked about how I was going to sort it going forward.\n I spoke to the SS, and she was like “Righttttt…” but basically said that she’s not going to feather and tar me and thanked me when I said that I had sorted it going forward. I did apologise as I am responsible for Mimecast.\n Anyway, I still have a job and the held queue is clear.\n Thank you all for commenting. At this stage, I’m not comfortable with allowing users to release their own emails as I don’t trust that they won’t end up being stupid about it, but I will look at potentially revising the current process in place.\n I still feel a bit icky about it all, but at the end of the day, I didn’t know about it before as it hadn’t been raised. The sales supervisor said that at least now we know and it’s good that we know, which I agreed with, as it means that we can stop this going forward.\n One day, when I’m older than 22, and maybe when I’m a manager myself, I will remember this and tell my juniors about it, lol.\n This is by far my biggest fuckup in 3 years, but I think I’m going to be okay… fingers crossed!\n    submitted by    /u/KickAssAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Team of 5 including myself.\n 1 IT Director\n 2 Sys Admin\n 1 Trainee Sys Admin\n I currently deal with everything IT related; ERP, CRM, Department Software(HR etc), Network, Infrastructure, Procurement, Asset Management, Support, Setting up Branch's, Mobile/Tablets, 365, SQL/Databases, backup, HyperV, Storage and Programming/Design/Development.\n Basically every IT role you can imagine into one, that is the way IT has always been here.\n I have been here for around 6 years, the 2 Sys Admins 15+ years each and the IT Director 25+ Years. I have been given the opportunity in the next 24 months to takeover the roll of IT Director/Manager with also a chance to have ownership in the company.\n The 2 Sys Admins are very much stuck in their ways reluctant to new tech, struggle to keep up with demand, and very laid back. I am very much holding the IT function together as even the Director has little to no interest as he is retiring.\n I have brought up at our annual reviews the lack of interest and enthusiasm from the Sys Admins I get told they are \"getting on\" so will struggle and I just need to accept that they will try what they can to make sure they are keeping with the times but that's down to the individuals. I feel like they are just letting them ride it out, and hopefully they will retire in the next 5 years or so.\n These Sys Admins are on £3-4k less than me per year.\n Do I hold out and take the opportunity while still having to do all the tasks/functions above or just start looking for a new position over the next few months?\n    submitted by    /u/i-do-IT-all  \n [link]   [comments]",

But in the Missed, Outgoing and Received Calls lists it always shows the name of a former user C (Chris).\n The way we put the extension in place was we removed the old extension entry to set it up from scratch. Factory formated the phone (Mitel 5312) and now it still shows in those histories with the wrong name.\n There even is the same issue with just a contact of a phone directory entry. We give some people a company mobile phone and one of those phones changed hands to a new person (Jane Goodall). So when that person calls it always displays the name of the former user (Sandra Bullock).

We have several protected computers VM and physical machines and everything works great. I have been tasked to setup a new server with windows server 2019 standard and add the server to the DPM. Whenever i try to install the protection agent through the DPM Administrator console this error comes up. \n Error 402: When trying to retrieve information from the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service on testSERVER.example.local, access was denied. \n I'm using Domain Admin credentials btw.The second thing i tried was installing the agent manually via cmd as administrator. This was a success and it also added some firewall exceptions. Having installed the agent manually i tried attaching it but i had the same exact error 402. \n Now i tried installing the agent manually on a windows 10 pro machine and as soon as i installed the agent manually the computer popped up on the management section no problem. I'm thinking there may be some compatibility problem with the version of DPM.

I then moved to the current MSP to gain some real hands on experience, which I most definitely have, wearing multiple hats every day since we’re such a tiny team. In the additional year and a half here, I believe I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals working with firewalls, servers, O365, Azure etc daily. \n I have no certifications currently but, working through CCNA and Azure 104 to not only get them under my belt, but to start filling in all the little knowledge holes I may have from jumping in to the deep in and learning to swim as I went along.\n Anyway, I’m mostly looking to hear from folks that work or have worked in the city, especially any quirks related to landing a job, living and working there, or maybe any mistakes you made along your way.

Its the kind of thing that does not let me sleep at night.\n From RTFMin a bit I've come to the conclusion - please confirm or correct me:\n  \nif application permission is via GraphAPI - yes, the Mail.* permissions are given to the app on ALL mailboxes in the org. You HAVE to use ApplicationAccessPolicy to limit the app's access (doc here).\n 1. if application permission is via 1. Office 365 Exchange Online API - no, there needs to be an explicit Exchange Service Principal and that be assigned mailbox permissions (as implied in the doc here). Tested with the test tool mentioned in this blog (used temporary secret)\n  \nIf I got that correct, now my questions is - are there other APIs that mail? How - as an admin - am I supposed to know and VERIFY the level of permissions granting admin consent will provide this app?

There later indicates controls should be appropriate to the level of risk. Therefore MFA may not be a necessity if other controls can be used to mitigate risks. For Cyber Essentials, MFA as a control seems non negotiable, i.e. mandatory.\n For context, here are some examples of systems I'm thinking about: - Finance systems used to manage employee company pensions - Finance systems used to manage corporate investments - Healthcare systems used to manage private healthcare benefits - Cycle to work schemes used to offer employee benefits\n Some of these systems are big household names, used by many many companies. They are sometimes difficult to transition away from meaning they'll be in use for the foreseeable.\n In summary, I'm trying to understand if the use of such systems will cause us any issues when working towards Cyber Essentials.\n Any help and advice would be appreciated 😁\n    submitted by    /u/FallActual8868  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should I just quit and do a Bsc in network engineering?\n I would really appreciate if you have any insights for me.\n Thanks for reading.\n    submitted by    /u/FutureSysAdmin_  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the things I liked about google domain was the cheap annual cost (£10), especially for something I'm not fully using. Checking cloudfare, I'm being quoted $20 a month for the pro package which is more than I've spend total over the past 2 years with google domains! \n The options I think I have currently:\n  \nTake the cloudflare basic package and pay $0 annually. If I decide to finally use the domain to build a website I'm not sure if it will be able to handle traffic?\n \nSeek an alternative domain registrar - Not sure who else can offer the same features and cost as I currently get with Google domains?\n \n Any help is appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Jetblast787  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently working as a Tier-2 helpdesk technician for a call center, which primarily comprises a remote workforce. Recently, we have been transitioning some of our users from traditional workstations to Azure CloudPC.\n Prior to this migration, our employees were using Cisco AnyConnect as their VPN solution. However, we were encountering persistent issues with call drops, primarily due to the users' connections. With the Azure CloudPC, we've seen a significant reduction in the number of dropped calls.\n Despite this improvement, we're now experiencing a new problem: there's been a noticeable audio delay reported by the users who've been migrated.\n While searching for solutions, I came across this, which introduces a concept of multimedia redirection: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/multimedia-redirection-intro\n I'm wondering if anyone here has encountered similar issues or can provide insights into whether this multimedia redirection could serve as an effective remedy to our audio delay problem. We use Five9 contact center software. Any advice or experience you could share would be greatly appreciated. I’m just sick of all these tickets coming in. \n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/escobartracy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got a title bump and a raise a couple of weeks ago. We’re a team of 4 and come Monday we will be a team of 3. This essentially puts me in a senior mentor position. I know one of my team members can handle their own self under pressure while my other colleague lacks the experience / depth of knowledge to own a sufficiently technical case without supervision. \n We manage everything from firewalls, backups, clusters down to networked and USB printers for most of our clients. At this point my boss expects me to step away from the technical and assume an operational role which would be nearly impossible with the current situation. I have closely worked with these folks and we all know each others’ strengths and weaknesses.\n It all just feels like stepping into someone else’s shoes that are 2 sizes too large.\n    submitted by    /u/tdiz009  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only IT employee for the past 15 years was a guy 60+ and promoted to \"Manager\" to onboard me and one other, less technical, new hire.\n He gets confused a lot. Admits he feels confused/incoherent sometimes. Takes a lot of days off. Tells us he's in and out of the doctor's offices multiple times a week. Expresses his interest in just sitting back and taking it easy now to let us take over.\n Unfortunately I've also found tons of issues across the system, including the fact that our product we sell to customers is just not very good. Customers are unhappy, and I want to work at a place I am proud of. Our MS licensing is a mess and management doesn't seem interested in hearing my concerns on it. Really... just problems I don't want to deal with since I've learned I'd rather just write SQL than be an IT generalist for a small outdated business.\n So, when an opening came up through someone I know to go back to doing that, I took it, and gave my notice today. It will almost certainly be better for me.

          "description": "Hey there, just providing some Google-Fu code for anyone who may stumble across this or be interested.\n I had to unzip ~500 1-4GB .7z files. Performing this task through the 7-Zip File Manager creates a batch job, running one at a time sequentially. Unzipping is CPU-limited, so it's going to take hours and hours to run. Running in a normal batch takes up 12% (1 of 8 cores, 100/8), there is plenty of power leftover.\n Powershell 7.3 introduces the -Parallel parameter for ForEach-Object, pretty useful and can massively speed things up. After some experimenting, I made some code that may be helpful to others.\n Note that this is for .7z files, installing the 7Zip4Powershell Module adds the command \"Expand-7Zip\". If you are using regular .zip files, use \"Expand-Archive\" and it's associated parameters.\n #Install 7Zip4Powershell Module [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force Set-PSRepository -Name 'PSGallery' -SourceLocation \"https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2\" -InstallationPolicy Trusted Install-Module -Name 7Zip4PowerShell -Force #Install Powershell 7.3 or higher winget search Microsoft.Powershell Y winget install –id Microsoft.Powershell –source winget Y #Exit Powershell, open Powershell 7 from Start Menu $PSVersionTable Should have a PSVersion of at least 7.3.X #Execute Parallel Unzipping Import-Module 7Zip4PowerShell $Dir=\"C:\\SourceDir\" cd $Dir $Zips=Get-ChildItem \"$Dir\\*.7z\" $Zips | ForEach-Object -Parallel {Expand-7Zip -ArchiveFileName $_ -TargetPath ($_).BaseName} -ThrottleLimit 7 #For the TargetPath parameter, \"($_).BaseName\" creates a directory based on the name of each 7z file, minus the extension.

I instruct the users to restart their machines (most often these are laptop users) once they start having weird issues as that resolves a lot of those. I'm just tired of explaining to users (who want to be helpful by the way) that \"Shutting it down and turning it on\" is not the same as \"Restarting\". So I have situations where they would say they restarted as asked but uptime tells a different story. With that out of the way, what is the best way to make \"Shut down\" actually shut the machine down instead of hibernating it or whatever it's doing. Do I run \"powercfg.exe /hibernate off\" when building the machine? But then I'm not sure if Microsoft would turn it back on with one of their updates. Or would it be better through some group policy? or something else? I just want it permanently gone. What is your experience with it? \n    submitted by    /u/Phratros  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the heart of every data center lies the 19\" server rack – a silent workhorse that has evolved significantly over the years. In this article, we take a journey through time to explore the history and technological advancements that have shaped 19\" server racks into the indispensable components they are today.\n The Genesis of 19\" Server Racks\n Back in the day, data centers looked nothing like the sleek facilities we see today. Those massive mainframes occupied entire rooms, leaving little space for anything else. Can you imagine that? As the need for better organization and efficient data management arose, the ingenious concept of server racks was born in the 1970s. But wait, there's more! The 19\" width standard came into play, bringing order to the chaotic world of data centers and allowing different equipment to coexist peacefully in standardized enclosures.\n    submitted by    /u/Timik_Enclosure  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For instance, my boss wants to move towards containerization. It's one of the biggest buzzwords nowadays, but I feel like no one in my department has a full understanding of it, just the core concepts. Therefore, when they containerize something, they basically just create a docker container of it on some random VM, and that's it.\n That being said, when I do something, I like to do it right. Best practice. Learning about containerization is one thing, but getting familiar with setting up an entire infrastructure dedicated to containerization is what I'm aiming towards. What are the tools available to us, both open source and paid? Can I just set up a Portainer machine and run all of our containers there? We've looked into OpenShift but it's insanely expensive. What's a better alternative?\n When I start down these rabbit holes, I do so with a fiery motivation. But eventually I get overwhelmed with not knowing what I don't know, and getting lost with the billion options, albeit none that are comprehensive.\n That's just one example of many in the infinitely complex world of IT.

So of course we've already terminated the user and they're no longer in AD. If I try to create a new user with the same username of course the SID doesn't match so it can't authenticate to the database to do any owner operations or assign a new db_owner. Of course because we let the vendor manage their stuff in our network they didn't add my team as db_owner I can't do anything in the DB and they've lost the default DB creds which they never provided to us in the first place.\n If anybody has any ideas how I can get past this problem without having to rebuild the database for an existing production solution I would be eternally grateful.\n And if you work for a vendor: I'm not mad at you but push back against crap practices like this. If you manage a solution for your clients, in their network or yours, it's your responsibility to maintain appropriate access to data and resources. That means making sure you don't delete the only account which has access to those resources. Same goes for everyone, of course.\n [Edit] ok, not all vendors suck.

I've been researching two main overlays for this task - Netmaker and Tailscale - but I'm having difficulty deciding between them.\n Our setup involves hosting some products in GCP and running internal services on Dell servers. We have a mix of workstations with different operating systems, and our network is segregated into VLANs.\n Both Netmaker and Tailscale offer different advantages and disadvantages. Tailscale, being a userspace WireGuard, might have slower speeds, while Netmaker could require more deployment and maintenance effort. However, the choice between the two may also depend a bit on how far we want to take the zero trust approach. For instance, should communication between two servers internally go through this solution? Is having to manage the ACL settings in a JSON file a good or bad thing (infra as code)? \n If any of you have encountered a similar dilemma or have experience with either Netmaker or Tailscale, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.

They are accessing inappropriate content 'family filtering' provided by cloudflare (1.1.1.3, 1.0.0.3) doesn't block (such as Maxim, SportsIllustrated). This way I can see what they are accessing, as to block them. Currently, I can't block what I don't know about.\n We are using a Windows Domain, and Windows DNS with forwarding to cloudflare 1.1.1.3.\n Preferably I'd like something that uses native Windows logging features, but if that's not available, a FOSS solution would be 2nd choice.

I supervise a few help desk/techs even have to pickup some tickets and do some onsite visits usually. My manager has strictly forbidden me from teaching anyone how to do anything outside their current roles, meaning it’s just me for the company office. Manager does not have a background in IT so they can’t help with much.\n As the company grows I’m losing more of my free time which is irritating me as I want my two days off a week to spend time with my kids and relax. It’s also forcing my spouse to have to shorten hours that she can work which means we actually have less money than we did last year. Before anyone says get a babysitter, I’m not paying someone to watch my kids, I don’t believe I should have to.\n I make 50k a year doing my job and they won’t consider giving me a raise until fourth quarter 2024. I feel like this would just get worse if I moved on with a larger organization based on reading horror stories here and by talking to others in the field.\n I’m currently expected to work 50+ hours a week at this point and since I’m salary no OT for me. CEO firmly believes salary = availability is 24/7. I’ve tried ignoring emails and texts while off but I learned quickly it is not tolerated and treated with write ups. I’ve been told as well to just cash out PTO since I’m the only one that can do a lot of things. My manager says “You being absent for a period of time would be problematic”.\n I’m starting to feel like IT is for people who don’t have families or a life. I’ve invested a lot of time, money, education into this field but Im kinda considering getting out while I’m still young and can.\n    submitted by    /u/BigFuckinShoes  \n [link]   [comments]",

His second choice was the Xiaomi 12 - even though I mentioned several times that it's a bad option if you are looking for a \"safe\" option - he bought it and returned it to me after 12 hours. He does not like it because there are a lot of \"Accepting things for Data Privacy\" pop-ups. Also, Apple is unfortunately not an accepted option at all. So, we are looking for an Android phone.

          "description": "Hi everyone. \n I'm working for a small company with nine employees, which doesn't have that many requirements concerning hosting - a super-plain, no-frills, static site with medium traffic. For some reason, the hosting provider (a small local company) we've been using so far sent a notification that they're raising the price starting next month without any rational explanation. \n My employer isn't happy about that and asked me to look into another hosting service. He's one kind of miser that would rather hang himself than pay an extra $40 a month without a reasonable justification (I get panic attacks when I remember the circles of hell I went through to get a raise a few months back).\n For the last few days, I've been looking into all these Hosting Services Compared, trying to find something that would suit my boss's financial requirements and, at the same time, would provide quality service. While researching, it hit me that I could open my own company and make some extra cash each month. \n I know a couple of similar companies (with some I worked in the past) that work with the same hosting, and I imagine they also aren't happy with the price increase. I don't think that it would be hard convincing them to switch to my service. \n I talked with a fellow friend who works in a hosting company today. But instead of sharing any advice, he tried talking me out of this, saying that it'll be a pain in the ass and not worth even trying because it'll be hard to compete with the giants that have a ton of employees.\n I'd really appreciate it if someone here who runs or has owned a small hosting business could share their experience. I'm particularly interested in the potential income, pitfalls, and problems that may await me if I decide to go on with the idea. \n Thanks in advance for your help. \n    submitted by    /u/acutelycrab27  \n [link]   [comments]",

I suspect said predecessors once activated inheritance on those 2 policies, as they get all those permissions from the top level. \n So on the one hand I'd really like to resolve this inconsistency and on the other hand ask about if the top level should really have THAT much in its permissions (gpo_permission_X.jpg). \n As it is the default domain policy I backed off just resetting the permissions to prevent breaking something that actually works as it doesn't seem to produce any problems currently. \n    submitted by    /u/TheFurianAT  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or should I be setting up distribution lists in Azure AD? Anything I should be concerned about in this change?\n    submitted by    /u/PsyduckAF  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is part of an Azure AD (soon to be called Entra) project.\n Does anyone have any experience with how the migration works with Dropbox or Google Drive? Since it's just really updating the existing profile, all the downloaded files for those apps would still be there. I understand that passwords do not migrate due to new user credentials in the new profile (makes sense) and will have to be re-entered. So, once that is done is Dropbox (for example) smart enough to realize allt he files are there instead of resyncing?\n ​\n On another note, how do apps like Adobe with cloud licensing migrate? OR do they have to be re-registered?\n ​\n Curious on any experience anyone has.

          "description": "Hi all. Due to life changes, I decided to leave a job at a nonprofit that I’ve greatly enjoyed both the job and the purpose of the organization. I’ve been there many years and was the sole IT person for about 100 people. \n We hired the only person who applied and he seemed underqualified but it could work. I planned my exit to work with him for a couple weeks and bring him up to speed. Something seemed off with him and I just realized today that it seems like he’s just going to use this gig to pad his resume. By itself wouldn’t be a huge concern but he’s planning some massive projects that will cost thousands of dollars that could otherwise be spent on the actual purpose of the org. Meanwhile he’s not considering some specific projects I’ve suggested that had been pushed back due to Covid and other restraints but certain outdated equipment is becoming a liability… just not a sexy project. \n One project is upgrading the network to 10g when we barely make a dent in our 200mbps internet bandwidth. He’s done no research with staff or historical network usage to justify any of these projects. Unfortunately, no one else in the org understands IT and I’m not sure anyone will question these frivolous upgrades. \n I’m debating whether or not I should bring this up with my former boss but I don’t want to get into a pissing match. I truly value the organization and the people there and it’s frustrating to see things going this route. \n My thought would be to bring up my concerns and coach on what questions to ask. Basically why do we need this upgrade? What problem does it solve? And what data to look for as a justification. \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Dougisnthere  \n [link]   [comments]",

The intake register connects to the fan, in the attic, and then the fan exhausts to the intake of the AC system for the property. Our local HVAC technician told me that it was a bad idea to have hot air running to the property intake when the system was not engaged, (actively cooling). I assumed he was right, but I could use a second opinion. \n That being the case, I think I need an AC unit devoted to this room.

Long story short, the place i work for needs me to install a program called VeriAdmin from a company called bioscrypt, that manages fingerprints stores in a fingerprint scanner from the same comapny. The only issue is that Bioscrypt doesnt exist anymore, and after calling the company that absorbed them, i was told that they dont have that software anymore. Checking online, and there are no downloads of this software either (i did find one called secureadmin by the same company but its not the same software sadly)\n Anyways, we have one windows 10 computer where that software is installed and works on, but its due to be retired next week. i've tried to transfer over all the files, including the .dll's and the registry keys from the working computer to a new one, but in the process of being transferred over to a flash drive, it immediatly loses some data, since the exe loses its icon and any information about it in properties. Despite this i try to run it on the new computer and it simply wont run either in compat mode, as administrator etc. \n I ran procmonitor on the computer where it works and on the newer one to see what could be missing, and apparently, right after trying to QueryNameInfo a DLL thats stored in system32, it fails on the new computer, because on the new computer right after it starts a registry key named \"windows error reporting\", while on the old one it just continues with opening the HKCU registry key. \n I checked the DLL and theyre the exact same, with the same permissions, and everything else the same. Im not sure that this is the exact issue with the software, maybe something happens after it runs that DLL that doesnt show up on procmonitor, but if anyone could help me figure this out i would be very grateful. here is a screenshot of the procmonitor logs and i show where it fails (the new pc is on the left, the old one on the right): https://imgur.com/a/pVhHaQC\n again if anyone can help i would greatly appreciate it! thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/SamPlantFan  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, they're all 'keep the lights on' jobs - and I'd like to educate and inspire the masses to do more.\n I'd really like to start taking ideas to the business on how to innovate, whether it's with Graph API, Flow, Power Automate, Teams or 3rd Party Addons.

          "description": "Hello,\n Our company is considering migrating our email and IT tools to Microsoft 365. Currently, we use our own servers for email, but we would like to transfer the domain to Microsoft. Additionally, for certain users, we are purchasing Microsoft 365 Apps for Business licenses, including Office apps, etc. We currently have 35 such users, but during the migration, we will need around 50 users immediately, and within a year, the number may exceed 100 as we expand into international markets (we already have open companies in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Poland, etc.).\n As the company is present in multiple markets, the plan is to have all admin.microsoft processes executed in the main company, while in foreign countries, there will be the option to only add/remove users with licenses.\n For optimal operation, we would require a plan similar to what Microsoft 365 Business Standard offers at €11.70 per license/month. I'm wondering if you have any other suggestions for optimizing the company's operations with this number of users?\n Additional questions:\n What is the management principle for \"aliases\" on Microsoft servers? Are aliases free?\n In the case of a business relationship, do they provide training for administrators, and do they offer technical support in case of any issues?\n Thank you for your assistance and looking forward to your responses.\n    submitted by    /u/42woba  \n [link]   [comments]",

We used a NAS in the past, but it was slow over the VPN and just wasn't the right solution.\n The problem I've got now is as users add into their shared folders, it saves a copy on my PC, which means I need to upgrade my storage. I'd rather not do that and need to look at an alternative way of doing things with OneDrive.\n One option I looked at was the plugin for our QNAP NAS called Hybrid Backup Sync.

Even when a temporary table is very small and can be processed exclusively in memory, PostgreSQL creates one or more files for each such table. And this happens even at each TRUNCATE of a temporary table. \n However, PostgreSQL allows you to create all temporary tables in a separate tablespace, which allows you to move all the files to a separate disk. As a result we have : \n  \nA separate disk that has exactly one folder that holds 500K files at all times.\n Of these 500K files, 99% of the files are either empty or less than 16K in size.\n There is constant active creation and deletion of new files.\n Reliability is completely unimportant. At any time you can delete the entire contents of the disk and re-create an empty folder.\n  \nAt the moment we use ext4 file system.

The existing servers were installed by their previous IT vendor and i'm looking for some recommendations on how to go about this upgrade.\n Their current setup:\n  \nDomain Controller - Windows Server 2016 (planning to replace after the file server)\n Used for very basic AD functions and DNS. Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.\n File Server - Dell Optiplex, Windows 10, 8gb ram, single 4tb hard drive (NO raid /facepalm)\n  \nI am looking to replace both machines, starting with the file server. The budget is about $3,000 for each machine. Their are a design firm and use Revvit / Autocad, thus cloud solutions are not viable, they store the projects on the file server and access them in office, beyond that its a very simple setup.\n This is what i'm looking at for the file server:\n Dell PowerEdge R250 / T150 Tower\n  \nWindows Server Essential 2022\n Intel Xeon E-2334\n 16GB / 32GB RAM\n 2x 4TB enterprise SSD - Raid 1 for data\n 512GB SSD for OS\n 10GB network card\n  \nDoes this look ok?

We current have multiple DFS servers in different geographical offices that replicate using DFS-R and then we use a software called PeerLock to handle file locking within the replication groups. This has been pretty solid but our initiatives are to move to cloud-based services. Whether it's SharePoint, Azure File Services, Egnyte or something else, that's yet to be determined.\n Some other info - 100% Windows clients, having mobile app access would be a plus, but not a requirement. Whether mapped drive or sync client is fine, we will need our users to rework files since we have an Excel linking problem, sheets linking to sheets, to sheets, to sheets, back to original sheet, and more sheets. Total storage need would be 15 TB initially. We also have folder overrun so we would definitely run into length issues in a SharePoint.\n I'm wondering what folks have turned to as their next version of file services in distributed offices that is as cloud-first as possible and what issues, caveats, or reviews you have.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/koecerion  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works when i attach the vhdx via diskpart - i tested it with a skrink from 30GB to 10GB. But when i loged in with that user the VHDX size is still 30GB.\n I copied the vhdx to the right place and also deleted the proxy and cache folder for this user.\n ​\n I also know the solution with frx.exe, but this isn't the best solution for me because of the broken permissions.\n ​\n Does anyone has an idea how i can shrink the vhdx with hyperv so that fslogix show the correct size?\n ​\n This would help me a lot\n Thanks\n ​\n NoInstruction\n    submitted by    /u/No_Instruction_3784  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m particularly interested in a web-accessible system where I can visualize server states (resources, alerts, services, containers, etc.), access them via the web interface using SSH, and add new servers either directly or by installing an agent on the server.\n Moreover, considering security is paramount in our field, I’d highly value any tools that offer two-factor authentication (2FA).\n I’ve explored solutions like Cockpit Project, Webmin/Virtualmin, Rancher,.. but none have all features. While these tools offer several of the features I mentioned, I’d love to hear what you all are using and if there’s something out there that might better align with my needs.\n Could you kindly share your recommendations, experiences, or even potential custom solutions you might have developed?

          "description": "I've only been managing the network in our organization for a few years now, but a phrase I'm very quickly getting tired of is \"it's the network/Wi-Fi.\" Whenever I hear a vendor, colleague, or end user utter this, the odds are about 8/10 that it's never the case. I can appreciate how end users or even technicians without a good bit of knowledge in this area might reach that conclusion, but what baffles me is when knowledgable IT people come to this conclusion with absolutely no evidence or reason.\n A case in point would be a vendor I recently dealt with, they're very knowledgable in their area and probably have more years IT experience than I've been alive, but then it pivoted to that dreaded phrase. Through the course of troubleshooting, it became clear they had no idea how DHCP worked. Again, I understand how people can have specialized areas of knowledge, but how the fuck can you spend 3 decades supporting networked devices and have no idea how they receive IP addresses!?\n Even beyond that, so many trash apps immediately throw errors like \"There's a problem with your Wi-Fi\" when in reality, they are experiencing an outage. Sure, that might sound better to the end user, but it's completely wrong and sending them in the direction of troubleshooting something that's working perfectly fine. Are the devs really that lazy and incompetent that they can't try to ping some common external resources to determine that the network is functional? Or shit, at the very least add the word \"might\" in front of that rather than convey with absolute certainty that your shit app expertly diagnosed that your Wi-Fi is indeed broken.\n    submitted by    /u/vtvincent  \n [link]   [comments]",

But really, doesn't almost EVERYTHING involve technology now?\n So we've been having a lot of conversations about how and who should take on some of this stuff. I'm doing what I consider traditional IT stuff for them. Business wide systems. Laptops, servers, 365 and similar cloud services, basic support, etc. and I find myself saying this a lot... That isn't \"IT.\" Things like data analysis, or application development, or trainings, or web design.\n And it occurred to me this really depends on how you define IT. I've worked at places where IT is one giant department that handles everything even tangentially related to technology. They are usually bureaucratic behemoths that everyone hates to deal with, but to each their own. And I've worked at places that decentralize this more. The communications department might handle websites, the analytics staff would handle data work, app development department builds apps, and an internal IT department does what I basically do.\n Curious how ya'll personally think about this and what your experience at different jobs has been. Is your IT department the kitchen sink department? Or are there specialized departments that handle different things, and if so, what is the department called that consists of admins and business wide support?\n    submitted by    /u/Covert_Tyro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could verify that, when I rename the ini file and execute the exe, the login window is empty.\n Anyone has an idea why and how to fix this?\n The program was made by a local software engineer, it doesnt need to be installed, but the exe needs Gupta Team Developer installed on the client, its a framework like .NET (I was told).\n Thanks!\n ​\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/sup3rdonkey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Make Google Workspace email\n 2. Assign it a permission level\n 3. Have it able to SSO to everything in the toolset via Keycloak and Caddy depending on permission level without needing to invite manually\n This should all be accessible via private VPN and for that I'm eyeballing Netmaker because wireguard go brrrr. \n As far as I can tell I can use a mix of Workspace, LDAP, Keycloak, and Caddy to achieve a setup like this that allows provisioning permissions easily and SSO and that's what I'm sitting on right now. \n Anyone got advice? Better practice or setup?

And to use a translated version of a Dutch saying: I can't see the forest through all the trees. (There are too much of them to lose overview).\n The one we choose mustn't break the bank to much, but other than that we are allowed to suggest any ticketing system we feel would suit our needs. However, from what I can tell, most of them offer the same services with the same quality and for comparable prices. So my question to you all is: Which ticketing system do you use and why should or shouldn't we go for that one? One requirement though, it must use/support AzureAD SSO.\n I'd love to go for a big one like Service-Now or Jira, but I think those options will be shot down due to pricing. For reference, we are ±200 employee commercial company with 5 people in IT (not all 5 do support, but they will get an operator account).\n Can't wait to read what you all are using.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/ohohrobinho  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here’s my issue, my coworker implemented brother’s with web scan in a different office but the issue is that after 10-15 users, each user needs to kick the other off to use it. I don’t think that’s scalable unless you plan on buying multiple MFPs for departments. In the past I was using PinPoint Scan with Kyoceras which I really liked.\n The way I see it is I either implement the solution already in place, or make the call to be different with hopefully the other offices following suit.\n Now, I’m no printer guru so I would love to hear what you all use for printing/scanning to the cloud (OneDrive preferred). I’ve spent a few days doing research on just Brother but I’m not finding much besides the web scan feature.\n Thank you!!\n    submitted by    /u/yoyogigibaba  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to sync a perforce project with a team in NZ and I'm based in the UK and no matter what connection I try I'm getting a hard sync limit of 2mbps up and down. I've tried two different PC's and two completely seperate internet connections with different providers.\n The port 1666 is forwarded. All firewall rules are set to allow P4V to access. I'm not recieving any network or connection errors, it's just insanely slow. Our sys admin gave me an IP for the US server and this has the same issue, hard limit of 2mbps. I've tried VPNs.\n My p4 info readout is instantaneous implying theres no issue with connecting to the server. Someone has tried using my account in NZ and it was fine so not an account issue.\n Unfortunately Perforce support still haven't replied after a week and our network admin based in NZ isn't too familiar with it but can't see what the issue could be on his side of things. So reaching out to alternative means. Will happily ping someone a tip if they help me fix this as it's really pushing my progress back on the project.\n Cheers!\n Edit: Running Windows 11. Workplace Ethernet connection and two different mobile hotspots have been tried. All yeild a hard sync cap of 2mbps. Zero issues with pulling file lists or connecting to the project in perforce. It's purely file transfer that is experiencing the latency. No Kaspersky\n    submitted by    /u/boxofrabbits  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried to find online what this means but no luck - any ideas? Is it the hours that the robot has been in use, or the hours the library has been doing backups (e.g. reading/writing to tape). It does have a power on counter, so it won't be related to that.\n Also has anyone got experience with these libraries - anything to look out for? Well be using it with 2x LTO6 SAS drives.

Seems to make total sense, and we don't have complex management requirements, and we're already licensed for it.\n Our current environment is pretty simple and 'traditional' - machines joined to a domain, a couple simple GPOs, and some third party patching and inventory apps. All Win10, but looking to move to Win11 later this year and next:\n I have a bunch of questions that I'm having a bit of a hard time nailing down and getting conflicting answers:\n  \nIf we enroll a PC, it looks like it still stays on the domain... At that point I guess we just... disable GPOs (and move them into InTune)? I presume InTune should become the single source of truth for management/policies? \n User Profiles - If we enroll a device and they're still joined to the domain - I presume they keep the existing user profile?\n A user gets a new PC (Win10 or 11) - Should it even be joined to the domain at that point? Is there any value add anymore?\n Virtually all of our apps are web apps - except for a traditional file share (Z: drive) - I know a non-domain machine can still connect to a file share (they would need to manually put in their creds)... Anything to be aware of here? (We want to get rid of this file share, most of our stuff is in sharepoint, but we still have a legacy LOB app requiring it for now - looking to get away from that next year).\n Servers - Can stay on the domain (and probably need to), but what are you all doing for management of servers (eg. patching)? I know Azure has autopatch and a few things, but that seems very... limited in behavior.\n  \nAnything else we should be aware of? Seems simple from a certain standpoint, but also completely different than what we've been used to doing for 25 years.\n    submitted by    /u/sysadmin99  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n We have a customer running a product called Autodesk Vault on an AWS instance (Windows Server 2019). Recently they have been experiencing really poor performance on the software and we've been trying to get to the bottom of it. \n The software is file storage / BLOB vault with clients connecting to it via a IIS web application layer. The customer has about 3 users on the system so it's not a huge deployment and the vault database is about 150gb (140gb of BLOB and 10gb of database spread across ~ 15 MDF) \n  \nThe instance is idling most of the time on CPU ( <10% usage)\n It's using less than 40% available memory. I've checked SQL server and it's using about 1/4 of the available 1.4gb shared memory pool\n Network speed tests are very good (as you would expect from AWS)\n Disk activity doesn't appear very high but...\n  \nHaving checked everything with the developers, the problems seemed to be stemming from the database. We've upgraded the storage from \"gp2\" tier to gp3 and doubled the IOPS and throughput from 900 IOPS / ~250MB/s to 5000 IOPS / 500MB/s.\n Having done all this its running a bit better but not dramatically better. It's not clear though if it is the storage which is the bottleneck or if something else is going on.\n The server currently runs MS SQL Express 2019 but we're nowhere near hitting the memory pool limit and it doesn't appear like its getting thrashed. I just wondered though if there are any other limits/issues which could be causing this version of SQL Server to be causing problems? \n Does anyone know if upgrading to MS SQL Server Standard 2019 offers any performance benefits over Express for general SQL work loads?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Soup_Roll  \n [link]   [comments]",

The nodes ended up in an unusable state everytime because \"the batch agent extension provisioning has failed on compute node\". I also didnt see the vms being allocated inside any of my subnets, so then I explicitly created it in one of my snets. I did see them allocated in that subnet, but the 'unusable' result was the same. I have no private endpoint for the vms, and the policy of my organization does not allow opening the RDP port publicly, so I cant use RDP to test anything in the vnet. But before configuring the batch to be created in the subnet, I connected to the vm and it seemed like nslookup did find the DNS of the storage account for the batch. However, the resource files are not being downloaded to the VMs from the storage account. The NSGs are already configured and the ports should be fine.

          "description": "Can I just say that I hate Printers with a passion? Especially HP ones? Hewlett Packard really needs to do some quality control on all of their products. I recently had to unbox and install an HP Printer/Scanner in a controlled environment for work without an internet connection and you would think I was disarming a bomb. I unboxed the Printer, added paper to the tray, closed it and plugged it in. And immediately the printer began printing NONSTOP. Eh you know 5 years in IT and nothing really surprises me like this… it’s definitely the first time I’ve seen something like this. I read the entire manual included. The first issue: the “manual” is only three pages all basically telling you to download the app on your device. Uh oh. No internet. What now? I go to the website. Problem number two…",

If you've ever had to shuffle mDNS traffic (discovery of printers, chromecast, airplay devices, ...) between VLANs, this is for you. The go to solution on the internet is installing Avahi on a linux VM somewhere and turn on \"enable-reflector\" to make it rebroadcast mDNS traffic received on one interface to other interfaces. But it's a kludge, you need a linux VM to start with and then for every VLAN you need an interface inside that VM...\n But Cisco routers & switches can do this on their own, here's a simple configuration with 3 VLANs:\n ! service-list mdns-sd PERMIT-ALL permit 10 match message-type any ! service-routing mdns-sd ! interface Vlan3 ip address 10.1.3.1 255.255.255…",

We cant login with our domain users because we always get the error \"please input your crendetials\" even after inputing them.\n So i tryed changing the cert which the server already got from the ca and ran into a even bigger problem.\n With the the \"C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\vCenter Server\\vmcad\\certificate-manager\" manager. Not a big problem i thought as i run the setup i came across another BIG problem. After selecting 1 for changing the cert the setup asks you to put into your pw for \"administrator@vsphere.local\" and yea we lost that somehow.\n Okay next step trying to reset the \"administrator@vsphere.local\" user acc. I used the \"vdcadmintool\" tool tot reset the pw. Which worked BUT when i try to log into the acc via the webinterface i always get \"wrong username or pw\" so as it now stands i cant login with my user due to the cert problem and when i try to change the cert i cant login into the local admin.\n Have any of you ever experienced such problem? Which pisses me of the most is that resetting the \"administrator@vsphere.local\" account gives me a pw but that just doesnt work.\n Oh we are using vSphere 6.7\n So googeling a few yours brought me nothing so now my hope is with you guys.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Blooddragoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

E.g. red for spine to leaf, purple for external fibred APs etc.\n I've spoken to our fibre distribution partner who has suggested either velcro ties around bundles of cables or clips /labels which work to an extent but as with copper if you've got a big bundle of SMF, it can be very useful to identify a cable via its function.\n Draw backs as far as I can see:\n  \ncost of custom patch leads\n confusing the badgers out of anyone external who doesn't know about the colour schema.\n standards compliance\n  \nSo the question! How do those of you that have masses of SMF manage fibre by function? Is coloured fibre patch leads absolutely crazy? \n Thanks,\n NS\n    submitted by    /u/NetworkSeb  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company is trying to hire more full time people (I myself am only there for a few months now) but we simply don't have enough for the workload.

I have a Dlink DGS-1210-10 switch specifically for the fact that it's fairly small, and I can configure MDI/MDIX manually through the web interface. This is a requirement for our testing, as we need to know it's our test device doing the AUTO part of MDI/MDIX or not. I also have a bunch of Stratix 5400's that'll do it, but they're huge beasts that don't fit in my backpack well. \n The easy button is a cheap old hub with an uplink port. I get it. But I also need SNMP for some network scripting development in the future. I'm also hoping to include the MDI setting in that script.\n Do ya'll know of, or can look for, a switch with these manually-configurable options? I've spent hours trying to read webUI screenshots looking for these settings, since every company just advertises \"Auto MDI, never worry about it again!\" (Which is correct, but useless for me). \n So, I need hands-on experience with a small, portable, configurable switch that has this weirdly specific option. I can buy another DGS1210, but there has to be more than one option out there.

If we need to connect to a building miles away, we need to use single-mode fiber optic cable.\n I understand the part about using multi-mode fiber optic cable inside the building, and I also understand the part about using single-mode fiber optic cable if we run it outside the building and connect to a faraway building.\n The part that confuses me is the part about interconnecting from the outside building to the inside building using the ODF or termination box. If I'm not mistaken, it's not possible to connect a single-mode fiber optic cable to a multi-mode fiber optic cable, because the core of a single-mode cable is 9 microns and the core of a multi-mode OM2 cable is 50 microns.\n Right now, I'm not sure what to do, because I have two suppliers: one from a telecommunications company and one from a cable company.\n - The telecommunications guy suggested that we use single-mode cable inside the building and multi-mode cable inside the data center. I agreed with him, because if we need to connect sites over a long distance, we'll need to use single-mode cable from the outside to the inside.\n - The cable guy suggested using multi-mode cable throughout the building, but he didn't give me a clear explanation of how we would connect the outside to the inside.\n So, what is the right design?

Basically, I had the smart idea of colocating some of my equipment in a datacenter which is what I am using the CRS for. My colo provider provided me with a /27 set of ips. In the quick config, I gave the router a IP address which works (I am able to ping and access it, and I am using wireguard). I have a hypervisor that I will be creating VMs in. The hypervisor allows me to enter a pool of IPs to use so it could automatically assign a static IP from that pool to a server (also I need to give the hypervisor an IP as well). I am basically stumped on how to assign (or rather make available) a pool of IPs to the hypervisor that is connected directly to the router. The router seems to have picked up the IP I defined just fine. I tried doing a DHCP server using the pool of static IPs on an older config and when installing ubuntu server on one of my servers, it seemed to have pulled an IP and get internet as it asked to update the installer but I since have cleared that config as I ran into issues, and that I don’t think I want to do DHCP but I want the server to be able to use the addresses for manual assignment. Any ideas on how to accomplish this? Would it be just a question of making sure the configuration on the device side is right?Also all of my LAN ports are on a bridge (aside from the WAN port).\n Any help would be appreciated, thanks!.\n Screenshot of config in quick config - https://i.imgur.com/esD8CdB.png\n ​\n Screenshot of address entry on WAN port - https://i.imgur.com/C9qZ8v0.png\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/iTzzKoLT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n Reading tailscale's documentation about how they allow peer to peer connection through UDP hole punching, there is something I don't understand : tailscale uses wireguard, so the server to which we want to connect needs to listen on a certain port. Let's say the client wants to connect to the server, but the server is behind a NAT, with no port forwarding. Then, tailscale uses STUN servers, and with the ip + port information, can do UDP hole punching to let the client connect to the server behind the firewall. However, this peer to peer connection only works on this particular random port, and doesn't connect the client to the listening wireguard port ? One solution would be that they use iptables which redirects the higher ports to the wireguard ports, but I don't think that it's the case because it seems really impractical...\n How do they manage to do this ? Is there something I don't understand ?\n    submitted by    /u/Chomosuke123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even if the receivers on switch A are only wanting to receive the sources on the same switch, all the sources are still gonna be sending a copy of their traffic to Switch B, the querier, correct?\n If that's the case, won't that mean the link between switch A and switch B is gonna be completely congested and dropping packets?\n Or do the sources on switch A just send reports to the querier on switch B so it's not forwarding the full multicast traffic to the querier unless there's a receiver on switch B that sends a join?\n ​\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/shivellebits  \n [link]   [comments]",

They only two things I can think of to try next are putting in a third party switch between the Check Point and Unifi switch, or wiping out the Unifi configurations and factory resetting everything thinking there might be a bad config somewhere. \n Anyway, if anyone has replaced a USG with something else, or have any suggestions I would love to hear them.\n    submitted by    /u/Fox_McCloud_11  \n [link]   [comments]",

The though recently came back into my head when I recently saw a reddit comment regarding an individual who owned an IPv4 /24 and used a VPN to a VPS that supported BGP to advertise the block without needed an expensive DIA connection.\n I have seen several Local Internet Registry's (LIR) in the RIPE region that seem to offer ASN's with IPv6 PA addresses for fairly cheap but they seem to attach there BGP or VPS services for anybody outside of the RIPE region. I'm in the US so this unfortunately raises the costs and complicates the billing. I would love to have an IPv4 block but I would be happy with an IPv6 block and an ASN to experiment with. My plan would be to essentially tunnel all traffic from my LAN to an opensense or pfsense VPS and then peer to the VPS provider. Maybe complicate thing with VPS in different sites and using it to host public faced services.\n So now that my long winded explanation is out of the way, has anybody done something similar to this? How did you acquire your ASN and IP block(s) and what reputable services are out there to register with?

Is it because it will forward the ping reply to 172.168.0.1, hence not receiving it technically, so it can send packets just fine but won't be answered to ?\n 2) Why can host 192.168.1.1 (the host on the top left) connect to the website hosted on 172.168.0.1 ?\n I have configured BOX INTERNET with :\n  \nip nat inside source list NAT_VLAN1 interface f1/0 overload (having configured the NAT_VLAN1 access-list beforehand)\n  \nFrom what i understand, it means that the HTTP request will replace the IP of the sender by BOX INTERNET's f1/0's ip address (10.10.10.1). I haven't done any port forwarding in the other direction though, so how can 172.168.0.1 send an HTTP response to 192.168.1.1, when from what i gather the response should be addressed to 10.10.10.1 ?\n I would greatly appreciate some explanations !\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Creepy-Ad3467  \n [link]   [comments]",

How would the configs look on the PE/CE side of the satellite site? I am drawing a blank.\n Also, if this isn't how a situation like this is normally done as well, please let me know.

The furthest the 3650 can reach is 1.2.3.1 on the 4451, but it cannot ping 1.2.3.2 on the 9504. However, the 9504 can ping 2.4.8.2 on the 3650. Because of the sensitivity of this network, I will not be able to post the running configuration, but I will answer any further detail needed. I would appreciate it if someone pointed me in the right direction. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Jonnnyjonn  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, we are forced to change these PRI's to a SIP - IP backbone from our carrier. Outgoing faxes seem to be fine but when we receive outbound faxes, some do succeeded but alot of them fail as well or have cut off pages. \n I have worked both with Cisco / Xmedius support and they stated that it was the carrier that was having the issues. Our configurations are very simple.\n ​\n We are looking into other solutions and one that was mentioned is to have a dedicated internet sip circuit to service our faxes. I am very new to this and I was wondering if anyone has had issues like this when switching from PRI to SIP and if having a dedicated circuit actually fixed the issue. \n    submitted by    /u/sikkwittitt  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, the single distribution switch is still indicating a storm. \n I read that taking a Wireshark capture of the network will help locate the source of the of the storm but that seems to be as in depth as most of the tutorials tend to go. Does anybody know if there is any way to locate the source using a Wireshark capture? Appreciate any help! \n    submitted by    /u/Gaffer122  \n [link]   [comments]",

He shows me an OTDR protocol which states: OM3 G50/125, distance test 200meters, 1300nm successfull\n I asked the electrician if he can also check for 850nm but he said his OTDR module can only do 1300nm on multimode fiber\n I checked the old transceivers and they are original HP 1310nm SFP+\n Is it possible that 850nm on an OM3 isn't working while 1300nm is working? I run this setup everywhere else with the exception that everything else connected this way is directly patched, like server to switch or switch to switch without walled cables\n Any ideas whats going on here? I'm willing to buy new 1310nm transceivers for me current switches but I want to understand what the issue is here\n Edit: after the HP switch died, I used 2 Arubas with genuine Aruba 850nm transceivers\n since they didn't work I tried 2 different switch models from FS.com, but those would also not get a link with included 850nm transceivers\n all transceivers would show up on the switches as working but disconnected, direclty connecting them with a OM3 patchcable worked so the issue has to be the walled OM3 cable between the buildings\n    submitted by    /u/gr0eb1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Everyone. Hoping for a little guidance where possible.\n My company recently paided for a leased line (fibre) to be installed as the standard broadband is a terrible 30mb up 10mb down. The vendor has sent a Cisco 1100 4P Router which we assumed would connect to an Unifi AP AC PRO and broadcast a staff and guest SSIDs to the site. Its only a small office with <10 staff and visitors at max so the fibre was purely to improve speeds.\n Now the issue - They configure the device and turned off DHCP on the router so there is only 1 port active that needs a static IP. The AP AC PRO can be configured with the static IP but won't issue IPs from DHCP. They have disabled the ports and DHCP for \"security purposes\".... I have asked for more info about why they can't enable it.\n Looks like I need to setup another Router with static info to connect to this Router but has anyone else had a Vendor do this? Also what Routers have you used for small businesses that would fit this scenario?\n    submitted by    /u/Smile-Weary  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some of the devices are newer arista devices, others are much older cisco devices like 3700s. \n I understand that I can use tools like nornir and netmiko to connect to devices, but even using Netmiko's TextFSM feature, I don't always get structured data back. (For example, using netmiko to connect to an arista device and running the command \"show version\" will return structured data, but running the command \"show interface et5\" will not return structured data. I really want to be able to pull out values like CRC errors or light levels and other smaller things.\n I've looked into NETCONF, but it looks like a nightmare of a learning curve. I understand that I need to figure out what yang model I need based off of what OS I'm running and it's not entirely clear what model I need to use if I want to get a specific value or the output of everything that I'd normally see by running a command manually in the CLI. \n To add to this, all API capable devices running in our network have their APIs turned off and I understand I'd want to use HTTPS, but I don't know what would be involved in setting this up for every device across our network. I've read that it's not recommended to run HTTP for APIs in a prod environment for security, and that self-signed certs from the device also aren't recommended, but I'm not sure how I'd get external certs for our internal devices.

I’m dealing with a site that is getting constant complaints about zoom not being stable. And I’ve tossed everything I could at this site, cape sensors, on-site engineers, thousandeyes monitoring etc. it wasn’t until I got endpoint details that showed me ‘packet loss’ to zoom. First thing I did was have an engineer run ping commands to zoom. This returned back (DUP!) for every other response. My first check was to Google why..nothing could really answer this for me. So I got packet captures at the firewall and the endpoint. I could see one packet leave the machine. But the firewall saw two packs. This means I need to check the WLC. I look and see the primary and secondary controllers were playing their correct roles. But looking at the interface statics I could see the secondary controller was matching packets as the primary. I shut off the ports to the secondary and the DUP! Went away. When I turned back on the secondary controller they started back up. In all of my years I’ve never seen this. Long story short. The firewall team turned off icmp on that network. Secondary controller could hit primary and vise versa, but the secondary could not hit the gateway and turned itself on. But didn’t tell anyone that it did that. So in case you hit this issue and are googling, I hope this solves your problem.\n    submitted by    /u/x1xspiderx1x  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I posted this on r/sysadmin as well, but thought this might be a better fit.\n I have freeradius3 installed and working as expected after following this guide: https://www.nasirhafeez.com/freeradius-with-google-g-suite-workspace-secure-ldap-for-wpa2-enterprise-wifi/\n The issue I am running into is that it doesn't work with Chromebooks, at least I've not been able to get it to. All other clients seem to work fine, but apparently chromebooks don't work with the Phase2 GTC method.\n I'm super new to freeradius. I tried to edit the configuration to use TTLS-PAP, but that doesn't seem to work.\n After doing some more digging, I found the ldap_google module in mods-available and the google-ldap-auth in sites-avialable. I tried a clean install of freeradius, and used those files the best I could understand.\n There are several things I don't really get, and I've found almost no mention of these files while googling.\n 1. Does this ldap_google completely replace the ldap module?\n 2. Do I have to enable the normal ldap module as well (I wouldn't think so)?\n 3. Do I need to replace all of the mentions of ldap with ldap_google in the default virtual server?\n 4. I have no idea why this isn't authenticating...\n I'm including the log and the configs below.

          "description": "So I followed Meraki's suggestion for load balancing and failover of client VPN connections, and it is mostly working (leveraging built-in features from our DNS provider). Connections are load balanced across 3 offices, each with a Meraki MX firewall with the Anyconnect client enabled. For failover, if one of the offices goes down, DNS will take that site out of the pool for VPN connections. However if a user is already connected and the connected site goes down, the connection doesn't automatically attempt one of the failover targets. It attempts to reconnect to the original site until you say 'disconnect', then the next manual \"Connect' will find a good host. I'm trying to determine if there is a way to make this process more seamless. I've tried a little tweaking of the Anyconnect profile settings, but I'm getting the impression these are really geared towards ASA functionality. Just wondering if anyone has experience in a similar setup and getting seamless client VPN failover. I'd also take suggestions on a solution that nixes the Meraki client VPN service altogether.\n    submitted by    /u/bmessinachicago  \n [link]   [comments]",

Couple questions are: Do I need a router, or will a managed switch do? They are providing us one uplink and my thought is to tag a couple (or all) the ports with the VLAN ID that the IP addresses are on and connect my servers and their IPMIs to it, also tagging the vlan id and filling out the network config they gave us from there (IP address, gateway, netmask, etc.). I saw a comment somewhere on reddit regarding colo prep and someone recommended to \"lab\" this before going out the datacenter and I am trying to figure out what that entails - do I just mock a router that is configured with the VLAN ID and make the local IPs be the actual IPs, config the switch and servers and make sure they could talk to each other?\n ​\n Also another question is, if I need a router, how will will I make the connection to the uplink? I am looking at Miktrotik and I assume it would be easy as defining addresses to an interface (uplink)? For routing, what would you use? I am looking at both Mikrotik and pfSense.

I’ve tried mounting the file share as a mapped drive and as a network connection. \n No matter what, when this machine is connected to the VPN, it can connect to the share and navigate the directories fine, but as soon as I try to transfer any file, it times out and if I’m using SMB it will freeze Windows Explorer. \n 2 other notes: - when connected to the VPN and I try to load a local IP in a web browser, say, the Synology admin portal, it also times out - the WebDAV connection has the same issues over https even when not connected to the VPN. \n What could this possibly be, and how do I test for it?\n    submitted by    /u/luckaeweb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Bit of context I am very new to networking but am trying my best to learn. \n My workplace has a lab environment that consists of two Avaya routeswitches connected to an Aruba switch stack and an Aruba wireless controller stack. I need to move all these devices to a new subnet.\n I have connected all these devices to an Opengear terminal and can connect to the console of all the devices. So far I have moved the management IP of all the devices to the new subnet. All the devices can ping the management IP of the other devices. I can see there are many other vlan interfaces that are still in the old subnet. Am I correct to assume that I need to assign all these vlan interfaces an IP in the new subnet?

I’ve already bought the hardware, being two servers, and I want some advise on what I’ve chosen to do and if anyone has a different way that might be better for management specifically.\n So first things first, I got a 1u R620 that I plan to install pfsense onto and have it route 3 different incoming wans into 3 different places. One will be a private network with full firewall and all, another will be a similar one but will specifically run a few servers that are ported out through the firewall. And the last one is going to hold my email server (I’ve got rdns and ip configs in place)\n Both of the “public” networks will be routed to a single server, R720 running proxmox(because I like it) and will be internally routed to the vms it needs to go on. My next no open ports network, is going to be my management network I guess, specifically so I can configure the pfsense when needed without exposing the webui of it to any other server. I’m thinking a little Dell optiplex running Ubuntu server and something j can connect to it with. I plan to have some sort of vpn set up so I can vpn in and talk to that management network.\n I know this sounds not the best and messy, hence why I’m here. It’s the best I could come up with in a few nights. Some guidance would be nice to see what other people recommend for this.

My VAR is doing the driving on implementation but I'm trying to familiarise/learn myself hence the (probably easy) question.\n In my lab, this is my current setup. The two core switches are MLAG'd together w/ VRRP for core redundancy, that's fine and works great.\n For the edge/access setup, I have two /30 interconnecting VLANs with OSPF interface enabled as P2P. On our current network, this is how we do it with RIP. I then have two default routes, one pointing to the core's SVI on each link for redundancy. It works, but it's slow(ish) to rebuild OSPF routes when one of the links go down.\n An option I had in mind was potentially setting up a VRRP in a /29 for the SVI's and then MLAG'ing the ports on the core, with a static route on the edge to the VRRP address - but it feels like I'm reinventing the wheel somewhat and overcomplicating.\n If you were setting up a new edge/access in your network, how would you do the redundancy which offers the best speed and convergence time?\n Any help/guidance would be much appreciated, thanks. :)\n    submitted by    /u/RiceeeChrispies  \n [link]   [comments]",

When that issue was solved, we could see the interfaces became up but there was still no IP connectivity between the remote router and core router, no ping between them and, consequently, no BGP session. \n I tried resetting the BGP, doing shut/no shut to port at core end but the issue was remaining. \n We have CDP disable due internal policies, but I enabled it to see if the devices were seeing each other at L2 and, suddenly, connectivity was recovered and BGP session became up. \n I guess when I enabled CDP, traffic was generated through the interface and remote MAC learnt (I did not check MAC address table prior enabling CDP), but I don't really know why it needed to generate traffic to learn it.\n The other thing I could see during the issue was BGP state toggling between Active and Idle. \n This is the second time something similar happens to me, the other time was during a migration from an old core router to a newer one, when connected to the new core there was no IP connectivity until CDP was enable.\n Does anyone have an idea of what could be the reason I needed to enable CDP to provide IP connectivity between the devices? \n Thanks in advance for reading.\n    submitted by    /u/Sad-Bit-9057  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good evening from where I am. Quick question. Work related I have to setup a chain of like 6 switches (💀) in order to share a certain network. \n This setup stays for around 3 days. The strange thing is that sometimes, not really regularly, the switches tend to either don’t get link from the previous one, or loose the link to the next one. My quick solution is to restart the switches which always works. But it’s annoying because sometimes it’s more of them so my daily morning routine often is to go to all of them and restart them. \n My question now is, what can cause this? I know 6 switches in a row is a nono but there is no way around. It sadly has to be like this. Can it be the switches caching too much data or what could it be? \n Thanks for the help if someone can help and have a nice day.\n    submitted by    /u/Cautious_Surprise367  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was no internet. So I started troubleshooting.\n I plugged a laptop up the the secondary firewall and still nothing. I plug the laptop into router B directly and it was working with no issue, mind you DHCP is on. I ran tracert to see if I am getting out and I am. \n I look on ip chicken to grab my ip and this is where I’m confused. While still plugged into router B, My public ip is the same as the gateway address my ISP has given me.\n At this point I try to put the information from my ISP as static, when I do that it seems like it works for a bit then it just stops working. I swap to DHCP and it start working again.\n I’ve contacted my ISP and they were no help telling me everything I already knew. Such as what my ip, gateway address and subnet is.\n Supposedly per the ISP our ip is 54.82.137.233 and our gateway is 54.82.137.234 (obviously this is not ours but it follows the same template, they are both public) and our subnet is 255.255.255.252\n I’ve contacted our fire wall team and once again has confirmed our gate way is 54.82.137.234 but it’s also the public. Last resort I was going to get them to rebuild the interface but I’m still so confused on why the public is also the gateway.\n I need help understanding this. I’ve looked everywhere yet no answers. Mind you we have done failover test before with no issues.\n If there is stuff I need to clarify, let me now but any help is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/EducationalHoney3094  \n [link]   [comments]",

Riding across that fabric are multiple \"Connections\" that are lower bandwidth. Since my layer-2 connection is 10g there is nothing to hold back transmission other than the policer for the fabric Connection. Is there anything I should do to policy the outbound traffic before putting it on the Equinix fabric to protect my data? I am sending syslogs across this path, and there is no current option for making those logs use a reliable protocol. Is there anything I can do to prevent or minimize the policer drops from losing those log packets? If TCP it would drop and kick off the whole TCP retry process. Bit since UDP there's just no way. \n Right now I'm just watching the bandwidth with a 60-second graph and we're not going over 50% of our allocated bandwidth. I'm worried about the unexpected bursts due to some security event and then losing that fidelity. Is there anything I can do to help? Or is just more bandwidth the only answer outside of switching to a log relay with (more) reliable TCP?\n    submitted by    /u/Rednarb  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Outside interface is connected to a Hotspot with an ethernet port configured for IP passthrough. The hotspot is connected to my outside interface of the cisco router, the hotspot IP address is 172.16.1.1 which is my cisco routers gateway. I also have a switch connected to the ciscos inside interface which that switch interface is 192.168.2.2. From the cisco router I CAN ping internet addresses through the hotspot. This is because the source is the 172.x network. When I source the ping from the inside interface, 192.x network I get no replies. From my switch I can ping the outside interface of the router, 172.x but obviously not the Hotspot gateway of 172.16.1.1.

This previous work consists chunks of cisco configurations for OSPF and I'm trying to understand why he suggests in the configuration to create interface VLANS (SVIs) for OSPF between routers, he used passive default and then enabled OSPF directly on these interfaces (SVIs). My coleague apparently copied these configuration literaly to the actual router. The thing is that we already have /29 networks to route between routers so it looks like that we should be using those to form adjacencies. I'm not sure if he did that be cause he didn't have complete information of our topology (that's possible) or is it something I'm missing that should be done. \n    submitted by    /u/Terrible_Air_Fryer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe I saw the Aruba reference design say /16s are fine. I understand this is possible as with a controller you can control the BUM traffic as it ingresses.\n This has me wondering, is there any reason this isn't possible on wired network where you have the ability to apply centralised policy at a switch port level on ingress traffic? I know with Aruba it is technically possible to emulate the wireless setup with wired traffic by tunnelling wired traffic to controllers although we couldn't find any examples of customers doing this. Is it not possible on a traditional wired network where you have a NAC and centralised policy that can be applied at port level to discard BUM traffic there?

          "description": "When building EVPN-VXLAN fabrics typically the underlay is used for reachability of loopbacks for VTEPs and BGP peerings. I'm interested if others have experience of or opinions about connecting a subset of servers directly to the underlay, for a kind of hybrid IP + EVPN-VXLAN fabric.\n The use case is where there are a mix of servers which require pure L3, L2VPN and L3VPN connectivity which are connected to a single leaf/spine network. There could be different design options to cater for that, ranging from co-locating those servers on the same leafs, splitting them onto separate leafs with common spines, or splitting them into separate pods.\n The benefit would be having one network fabric servicing all flavours of server, the possibility for incremental upgrades (e.g \"upgrading/downgrading\" a port from L3 -> VXLAN without having to re-cable it to a new network). \n Are there downsides to this hybrid approach? Maybe scalability considerations as TCAM has to be optimised for both EVPN-VXLAN and \"normal\" IP routing? Convergence issues due to bloat in the underlay routing table?\n    submitted by    /u/Notworker  \n [link]   [comments]",

They're typically setup on a customer's network and they handle all the remote access, but I frequently start systems before their network is in place and having remote access is a great time saver.\n I have been using Cradlepoint with their Netcloud Perimeter VPN which was perfect. Now that they've deprecated that option, I'm losing my simple to use system. So, I figured I'd setup a port forward like I've done before with systems that use something like spectrum business class ISP. Now after some research into why it didn't work, I'm finding that the cell service I have isn't using publicly routed IPs.\n I've tried the IOT Advanced subscription option from Cradlepoint, but it's painfully slow and not at all easy to use. Do I have any options to get some sort of inexpensive VPN option similar to what was included with the Cradlepoint Netcloud subscription?

It's 10gig, but deployed by a provider who packetizes, so it does not behave like a traditional 10gig wave / private line which just repeats light. This means you can usually get up to several gigabits on a single TCP stream, but need more streams to fully utilize the circuit. There's about 50ms of latency between locations due to geography. \n The issue we're having is TCP performance is mostly horrible, but sometimes goes back to near normal. Using iperf, if I test between two nodes on the same layer two vlan that's bridged across this link, sometimes I'll see possibly close to 2 gbps, as low as 100 Mbit/sec, but typically averaging out in the sub-600 Mbit/sec range. Watching the linux tcp counters, I can see numerous retransmits, timeouts, backoffs, etc. So, clearly the circuit is dropping packets. \n If I switch to UDP and vary the send rate, 1Gbps or lower gets me 0.068% packet loss, 2Gbps 0.3%, 2.5Gbps 0.89%, 3 Gbps and we're into the 1.1%+ range with spikes as high as 6%. \n The end to end setup had been working fine for half a year and then on a specific day began this behavior.\n Has anyone ever seen a transceiver issue cause behavior like this? My experience has been those will have light issues and/or affect all traffic types. Light is strong in both directions. They also tend to go from working to failing, not something in between. In contrast, I've routinely seen this kind of issue affect circuits when there is an overloaded node in the path, an incorrectly configured QoS or rate limit config somewhere, etc. The transit provider assures me none of that is in place nor any overloaded or failing links in the path.\n    submitted by    /u/ispcolo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Rather OnPrem controller than cloud.\n Fast configuration, understandable QoS settings for the future Vlan separation between Lan and VoIP.\n The hardware should not be as expensive as gold, yet offer a certain degree of durability.

Do any of you know of an Android/Apple App that will monitor the Wireless Latency and Packet Loss (1sec interval preferred) of your network? Something that will allow me to ICMP Latency and Packet Loss monitor an IP address wired into the LAN to measure the WLAN Latency/Packet Loss at a site. Ideally this app will also log the AP MAC/SSID/Name that the client is connected to and you will be able to go hey I see our clients are getting a lot of packet loss near Access Point 1 for example. The dream state will allow me to upload a map of the site to the app and then do BLE/Wifi locationing to know exactly where clients are having packet loss issues on the WLAN (I know this is a dream state that probably doesn't exist yet).\n If none of you know of anything paid/free then I guess I will have to build something myself which I really don't want to have to do...

The power light is green, yet the \"STAT\" light is solid amber. I am trying to get into the device to troubleshoot. But i am blocked getting to it from the server (obviously) and connecting to the management port does not seem to do anything. The guide on Junipers website shows \"figures\" for ports our SRX340 does not have. \n Can someone please tell me how to connect to the SRX340 to check what the error is? My thought is the device isn't fully booting, and that's why I'm unable to manage/access any \"normal\" way. But thought I would ask in case I'm missing something, regarding how to manage/access the device to check why the \"STAT\" light is amber! \n P.S. I let it boot for about 45 minutes and it would randomly (at no obvious intervals, as I was timing the power up) the fan would kick on into high speed, and the \"STAT\" light would turn green for about 5 seconds, and then back to Amber.

Is it now time to look at other global carriers to offload some of our circuits, or is this likely to have a negative effect on cost when we manage it ourselves. \n The second, can we achieve better outcomes utilising our own SDWAN core, incorporating internet solutions as backup paths with global ports in different POPs etc. Utilsing a SDWAN core could potentially remove the requirement for a MPLS equipment and utilize SDWAN software (and likely cheaper hardware) for the routing engines, maybe cheaper than utilising a Juniper/Cisco core?\n Has anyone gone down a change in mindset on service delivery?\n    submitted by    /u/switched081  \n [link]   [comments]",

An engineer who started with Cisco in 1989 and literally designed and oversaw Caterpillar/BMW/Mercedes etc etc etc global networks before he retired.\n Rule #1 Be hungry to learn. Every interaction, even after 30+ years of networking, is an opportunity to learn and grow. Being humble and hungry also makes you more desirable to work with!\n Rule #2 Lab. Even if you think you have the right answer, you are probably wrong if you haven't labbed! If you are learning something new, lab it up. Take packet captures to see if you get the expected packets. Learn to read said packets while in the lab. Never forget to lab.\n Rule #3 RFCs, RFCs, RFCs. Taking the time to look up an RFC is generally faster than contacting a consultant or vendor for a detailed answer. It is likely, they are going to read said RFC before replying back to you.\n Rule #4 Follow the packets. Our job revolves around moving packets from A-B or from C to D-K. Understand where a packet comes in from and why then where it is going to move to next and why. Do this node by node. Whether this is super basic VLAN only or the crazy complex Multicast over EVPN, following the path of the packet is a concept which will never die!\n Rule #5 When following the network path, draw out the topology. You may have 50 devices in your whole network but the packet for source to destination may only cross 4 devices. Understanding this will always greatly simply things and prevent a 4-day marathon of troubleshooting an issue. In most cases, shortens those sessions to just a few hours or less.\n Rule #6 See rule #1.\n    submitted by    /u/Eastern-Back-8727  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not really looking at jobs yet, just mainly brushing up on old subjects and equipment configs that i haven't done in awhile and a thought struck me. Now that we live in a post covid world, what is the outlook for Network engineers to be fully remote? At the beginning of 2021 i worked as a temp IT support tech for a few months for a local resort whose network support was located in a different state. Yes, the engineers would visit every now and again but mostly they would remote in whenever there was a problem or a need to. This resorts company had properties nation wide but their network support team was based in FL. I'm curious as to how common this type of arrangement is.

Will I have an issue peering two isis neighbors both advertising the default route through default originate or will I need to filter it between hosts somehow?\n Edit: thinking about it I would think the local static default route will take precidence in the firewall and the default-originate route would never be installed unless we were to lose internet peering on one side.

Each connection may be a trickle of syslogs, or may be bursty during a security event, but still relatively low bandwidth requirements. However, once they all land at the one VPN concentrator there is quite a flow of those syslog messages on the wire. We are trying to send those to a log analyzer/SIEM in the cloud, and we are trying to overcome some bandwidth cost constraints there. Syslog is normally fire-and-forget, so if we have any bandwidth contention, it is possible for some of those messages to get lost.\n What do you recommend to overcome this possible data loss? More bandwidth is the easy option, but even then how do you scale for an event that bursts above even that? I'm thinking some sort of relay that stores and forwards, but forwards across the lower bandwidth link with a reliable method (RELP or the like?) to remove or significantly lessen the likelihood of data loss.\n Or am I looking at this all wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/Rednarb  \n [link]   [comments]",

A solution would be to use 4G routers at both ends and use VPN tunnelling to create a link. I think I will be able to use VLC streaming to gain access to the sensor screen from the base station laptop (I have seen someone make this work). However, I am not sure on the exact configurations and settings required Networking/LAN is really something i have no idea about I'm an electrical/aerospace engineer, so this is alien to me.\n Could I for example connect the sensor to a 4g router (TP link Wireless AC750) with an RJ45 cable and have a usb 4G modem connected (prepaid/postpaid 4G). Have the same setup on the base station with the laptop and using a VPN gain connection between them? I think this is called site to site IPsec VPN correct me if I'm wrong, it's quite confusing for me I have even heard the term DMZ host and not sure which to use. Or alternatively would a ubiquity Bullet AC work this uses their AirMax Protocol (based on TDMA) WiFi whihc has great range with the right antenna.\n Also, as a side topic, if the above were correct, can I connect 2 devices (sonar, onboard pc) to the same router onboard so that they share the same network. Is it possible to use that network to get the sonar screen live and at the same time use something like tightVNC to gain access to the onboard pc remotely from the base station? if they are all on the same network/LAN it should be possible they would just have different IP addresses?\n Thanks for the replies in advance I really appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/Due_Theme_3191  \n [link]   [comments]",

These consist of two clusters, one located at each site. The BGP configuration is functioning correctly without any issues.\n However, when these routes are redistributed into OSPF (Cisco), problems arise. Everything operates as expected until we start conducting failover tests. We sequentially disconnect ISP routers 1 through 3 in an attempt to force traffic through each router along the path. When we reach router 4, everything still continues to function properly.\n The issue emerges when router 1 is reconnected. As soon as this happens, it immediately expects, via BGP, that the traffic will be routed through it. However, the OSPF routing table has not been updated at this point and is still pointing towards router 4. This creates a black hole, as the routes are expected to come from router 4 via OSPF, but from the perspective of BGP, router 1 is now online.\n The underlying problem is that router 4 never lost its link state since it still owns the routes (OSPF).\n I hope I have managed to clearly explain this complex scenario.

The wifi basically is just to bypass the expensive cellular interface and bridge the devices via cheap wifi in this scenario.\n  \nIs it necessary to consider VLANs if clients are isolated and only access the WAN/cloud?

I've got some networking changes coming down the pipe and I need to move this connection on the N3024f side to a couple of the SFP 1G ports (Gi1/0/1-24). The SFP+ DAC cables I've been using won't work (in theory, and in practice, I tried them..) between SFP and SFP+ ports.\n What's the right DAC cable (or right kind of cable)? Due to the switches being a bit on the old side (I know..) I'm getting a fair amount of conflicting information about whether it's possible at all or what DAC cables might work? It seems like some people have backwards compatibility luck connecting SFP and SFP+ ports with DAC cables (provided the SFP+ side is locked 1G speed), but its not clear how much of this is the cable or what type of cable or whether it's some kind of vendor specific thing.\n I could always just use a couple of the N2048p copper ports to the N3024f RJ combo ports and be done with it, but the N2048p side is pretty full and I'd like to not lose usable access ports in the process. Another alternative option is using optics between the switches or 1G RJ45 ports on the N2048p side to the combo ports on the 3024f side.\n But DAC cables would overall be a better setup -- less parts, etc, but its not clear it will work or the cables for it to work even exist.\n    submitted by    /u/OperationMobocracy  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is my understanding that stacked switches will flood all their multicast traffic between all stack members as they're logically one switch which is a drawback. \n However, my question is - will links between stack members automatically loadbalance traffic (so 3 x 10gig fibers becomes 30gig link) - or do you need to setup the stack and then put your stack links into a LAGG effectively meaning you have the same limitations of a LAGG when doing a stack i.e. same limit of number of switchports that can participate in the LAGG.\n If they loadbalance automatically, is the load balancing performed via a different method that would make one method more efficient at loadbalancing i.e. layer 2 or layer 3 hashing?\n I'm aware this will vary depending on the chip used in the switch but any info regardless of switch brand & model would be useful, particularly Netgear m4300 range.\n ​\n One additional bonus question whilst I'm at it - is there any difference in the efficiency of loadbalancing when comparing a static LAGG vs dynamic (LACP)? \n ​\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/shivellebits  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dark fiber is being terminated on these switches in both sites.\n The routing is simple with a /30 mask being used and no ip switchport being configured on each dark fiber port on each switch. EIGRP is being used for routing.\n We use Solarwinds to monitor these devices.\n Now the problem is we are suddenly seeing issues on this dark fiber link starting today, was working fine until yesterday (last week there was a fiber cut which caused interruptions but has been working fine until yesterday since the fix). The port keeps flapping randomly every 30 minutes or so. Will go down for a few minutes say like 3 or 10 minutes at a time and will come back up.\n We opened a ticket with Comcast (dark fiber is from Comcast) and they sent someone to check the their equipment. He came checked within 15 minutes and determined it wasn't an issue on their end then got an email from them saying that it could be an issue with sfps/bad jumpers.\n Now upon checking on solarwinds I see a bunch of receive errors today not necessarily coinciding with the flapping but I do see them. It's about 10-18k received errors (only receive) on one of the switches (haven't put the other 3850 switch into monitoring yet) and this was today. Until yesterday the received errors were just 198-200 or so.\n So could this be an sfp issue on this particular port? Could swapping out this 10Gig sfp fix the issue? Or could it be a different issue?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Intelligent-Bet4111  \n [link]   [comments]",

The device I run iperf on would then generate the traffic for the test on one NIC and receive the traffic on the other NIC.\n If that's correct, then it would logically follow that people often use servers - or any other computer with multiple NICs - to generate the traffic with their traffic generator of choice (…",

So each server must have the same version of the back-end.\n - We need to extract some data's from each server to make them anonymous and build worldwide stats, which needs to be accessible for any user.\n For the first point, I was thinking of simply open new VPS on a given country, and just deploy the last stable version of the backend, and link all of them across our DNS. But i'm not sure if it's a good practice to have only 1 DNS server for people who want's to access a server far from the DNS ? Don't really know how does it works actually.\n For the 2nd point, i was thinking about a kind of proxy server, that put itself between the country server and the client, that will collect the anonymous data and store it in a separate database, and then duplicate and sync this server in the cloud to make it available all around the world ?\n ​\n My issues concern the stack i should use to make this kind of setup. My knowledge stop to NGINX, Docker & Node.js to be quick, and that seems to involve more complicated stuff, so if you can point me to some docs and/or softwares that would works for my purpose ?\n ​\n Thanks guys\n    submitted by    /u/Chichaaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

From the captures, I already know that about 40% of the frames captured are beacons, but I want to determine how much actual airtime this corresponds to.\n I know beacons are transmitted at the slowest mandatory data rate, and I know the frame size. But I don't think the airtime calculation is as simple as the frame size divided by the data rate (with the appropriate unit conversions between bytes and Mbps, of course), because I know the bits can be packed into higher MCS indexes / QAM encodings. (Or, am I thinking about this backwards, whereas a 24 Mbps data rate is the what you get at a fixed MCS / QAM?)\n So, in summary - with access to the PHY and MAC layers from an 802.11 capture, can I calculate airtime consumed for each frame? Or is there not enough info in a frame?\n This is in an 802.11ax network, btw, and I know it can get even more tricky with OFDMA's resource unit allocations, which I don't see any evidence of in the frame dumps. \n    submitted by    /u/wifi_engineer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Multiple (tens) of branch offices.\n Solution option 1 is FortiGate on each branch office, and also on HQ. They can then connect them with tunnels and whatnot as use-cases appear. It's a desentralized solution which I do like. Nothing needing user-licensing is also just nice. Possibilites are quite grand.\n Solution option 2 is Cisco Secure Access SASE with Meraki gear. It's a centralized solution, which means all branch traffic is piped through there. I read there's some 250 Mbps limits pr connection, which scares me, and it's a lot \"younger\" solution (but does that mean it's still immature?). Licensing is ofc worse, being Cisco. It does however bring a very centralized management as it's all centralized.\n Does anybody have good (or bad) experience with this Cisco, Meraki, Umbrella mash-up? Would love to hear your 2 cents. I'm very familiar with Forti, no experience on Meraki.\n The use-case is first and foremost internet connectivity, then adding on some security (web filter etc), and then possibly adding some centralized service from HQ (interconnecting to a partner or publishing a private app or server for instance).\n    submitted by    /u/Roy-Lisbeth  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue is we have intermittent very slow connection between a client and a server. It traverses a Palo Alto and a Checkpoint firewall. My layman eyes naturally focussed on the frequent 2-3 RSTs sent in quick succession. What's more, 2 of the RSTs have the same sequence number, and that sequence number was also seen in a FIN/ACK packet just sent, as well as Acked' in another FIN ACK... ie\n ​\n 443 -> 696969 [FIN, ACK] Seq=5202 Ack=6666\n 696969 -> 443 [FIN, ACK] Seq=6666 Ack=5171\n 443 -> 696969 [ACK] Seq=5203 Ack=6667\n 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6666\n 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6667\n 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6666\n ​\n Do you think I am on to something, as in this is clear indication the firewall is messing and/or dropping packets?

          "description": "Hello,\n I have kind of a strange issue:\n I have setup a few site to site IKEv2 IPSec tunnels with a few Cisco router. \n Settings: SHA512/AES256/DH-group20 for both P1 and P2.\n The tunnel establishes just fine, and everything works as expected (HTTPS/ICMP/TCP etc). Until the timeout is reached and its prepared for a rekey.\n Now with it being an IKEv2 tunnel PFS is only enabled upon the first re-key of the tunnel. Once this rekey happens, TCP traffic seems to stop working. Ping/Traceroute all seem to work fine. \n I don't understand why PFS is adding that much overhead to the Packet. As if I set the DF bit to clear, the packets are fragmented and TCP connections work fine again. So this is leading me to some kind of MTU/MSS issue.\n I tested a ping from R1-->R2 (without fragmentation) and the most I can get through before PFS is enabled is 1280 bytes, after PFS is enabled the max I can go is 1150 (alot of overhead being added to the pack which is strange). Which is an extremely small size (in my opinion) to set the max TCP-mss to.\n Now im waiting for someone to give me a PCAP of the trouble router to find the optimal MSS/MTU size, hopefully the issue will be more present there. \n I have a few sites working just fine with just ISAKMP/GRE/IPSEC setup. \n Sorry I have been troubleshooting this for some time now. Just looking for any advice you can give.

The backup router connects the corporate network via DMVPN.\n Currently, the LAN is directly connected to both WAN routers, ensuring redundancy through HSRP and IP SLAs. However, we now want to introduce a firewall cluster between the LAN and the WAN, so that the LAN side is protected by the firewalls and the default gateways for the LAN networks reside on the firewall. To achieve this, we plan to establish a transit network between the Cisco routers and the firewall cluster.\n The customer's network are isolated from other customers using VRFs. We are currently utilizing MPBGP with iBGP for the LAN customer networks and OSPF for overlay purposes.\n Here's what we have implemented in the past so far: redundancy through OSPF with corresponding costs and a distribute list to only learn specific networks.\n I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights on how to achieve redundancy for the firewall cluster in the most straightforward manner.

I have an x2 9500-16x switch in a VSS running as the core switch- Version 16.9.5. So the IP gateways of services are configured on SVIs on this switch. Lately, I started noticing heavy packet loss on pings destined for the SVIs on the switch. Below are my observation so far;\n Packet loss to the switch when running a ping test SSH traffic to the switch is very slow There are no CRC errors on the uplink. Traffic flowing through the switch has no issues. No packet loss to switches connecting to this core switch. No issue with data plane traffic yet. Now, i have looked at the system cpp policy and even increased the cpp-police-data rate to 800pps but didn't help.

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n I am aware that this may be a controversial topic that has been discussed before, but some of the existing threads include arguments probably not of relevance any more (e.g., power consumption of first generation NICs) or do not apply in my specific scenario (e.g., no plans to change to 10Gbit/s switching). So here goes:\n We have a NAS (Synology DS1821+) which is used for central data storage via 1Gbit/s LAN to a multitude of users - there is no intent to change this. However, one of our servers needs access to a lot of data being stored on this server, which is why we thought to upgrade to 10Gbit for this single connection (going up to 25Gbit does not seem warranted since we use SATA drives in the NAS). The distance between server and NAS are just a few meters, so we would not need the benefits fiber provides in this area. Costs should be kept as low as reasonable.\n - Would you suggest copper or fiber in this context? \n - We initially planned to use Mellanox ConnectX-4 on the server, but even off-brand copper SFP+ modules are way more expensive than I thought - on the contrary, the fiber version of synology's NICs are more expensive :D\n - We could also purchase a 10Gbit NIC for the server with RJ45: Do you recommend an Intel version? I have heard that Intel is leaving the networking market (but that may have been just for switches), so I am a little worried about long-term support. There are also versions of Intel NICs from different manufacturers (HP, DELL, etc.)...are these 100% compatible in any server (running Windows Server 2022) or just in servers of that manufacturer?\n Just let me know what you think :).\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/peter_cass  \n [link]   [comments]",

I verified all of my locations all have the same settings on their gateways so I'm at a loss. anyone else experience this issue?\n ​\n i should mention this is using Cisco IRS4431 gateway, and connected to CUCM.\n    submitted by    /u/idontbelieveyouguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am after some guidance/advise on implementing OSPF for one of our customers and I'm getting a little confused with the design implementation options. To give some background, we have a customer which has 1 main site and 4 branch sites (5 sites total). Each of those sites has their own VLANs that site on their core switches, and then there is a static default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the firewall. On each firewall there is a VPN to the central site for accessing services etc. The drawback to this implementation is that there is no 'inter-site' routing at the minute and to access another site you need to go out from the central site. \n With this in mind, I'm looking to implement OSPF but just not sure on how to design this, would all 5 sites sit in area 0, or would the main site be area 0 and the other 4 sites be their own respective areas? As I say, each site has their own core switches which the VLAN interfaces reside on so there are technically 2 x L3 devices (core switches and firewalls) at each site. I plan to use IPsec VPNs for the interconnectivity and utilise VTIs on the tunnel ends. I've tried to read up on this and view example topologies and although I understand the fundamentals of OSPF, I seem to be missing the very basics of a real world deployment!\n Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/YqPKoad6eNB6  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've seen configs where this is used as an alternative to untagPVID for VoIP or an inverse of the pvid with tagPVIDOnly.\n It seems like the device on the port would be able to communicate on its PVID vlan, but only be able to receive broadcast from the other vlans. untagall should strip all the 802.1q tags, so i'm not sure what vlan it's supposed to be communicating on.

Reason for this assumption is we have noticed that if we unplug the device on the media converter and then plug in a second device, the second device will not authenticate, because the switch is still seeing the first mac. The fix for this seems to be power cycling the media converter. Shutting and no shutting the switch interface does not seem to fix it, only power cycling the media converter.\n We actually had a device that was connected and failing mab authentication, but even when the device was removed, we still saw logs populating on the switch saying the device was failing. Personally, I was thinking this could be something with DHCP snooping still holding the mac in the database, or maybe some kind of AAA thing. But I really dont see how a media converter could be holding a mac, unless im wrong. \n Does this make any sense at all?

As this is mostly covering open standards I am hoping that this is the more appropriate place to ask these questions.\n I am struggling to find answers from Google and have reached out to another network engineer who isn't sure either.\n Once I have configured a secure ISAKMP connection between devices, I am aware that the device then negotiates an appropriate IPsec policy to follow. However going through the system help and exploring available commands, I have noticed that you can define an IPsec transform set without specifying most of the IPsec framework.\n As an example, I have made an IPsec transform set with the following command.\n  \ncrypto ipsec transform-set TEST-TUNNEL esp-3des\n  \nThe only things that have been defined from the IPsec framework from this command is the protocol type (esp) and the confidentiality (3des). I have not defined integrity, authenticity or the diffie-hellman group. Yet the iOS has accepted my command regardless and has created the transform set.\n How does the system make up for half the framework being unconfigured? Does it take it from the existing ISAKMP policy? A system default policy? Just create a tunnel without any of those policies applied or would it be unsuccessful?\n In addition i've seen the command comp-lzs as an option, though iOS does not allow me to create a map exclusively with this alone. From Googling I have seen that it has something to do with compression and should not be used alongside voice or video, though are there any good resources that can explain the lzs algorithm and its application in laymans terms?\n    submitted by    /u/RegularCeg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't have the login for the Unifi gateway, the router, no cables are labeled, nothing is organized. Anyway, I think the UAPs might run to another switch before going to the switch in the network closet but no one knows where that is located or if that's even how it was done.

          "description": "I work for a FTTH ISP and we are currently using a Cisco Nexus as our Edge. We are just taking default routes from our upstreams and we have two upstream providers (one 100G and one 40G). Traffic flows out one and back in over both. It works but we are looking to take full BGP tables from both and possible a third.\n We don't really use any advanced router features, just the typical BGP, OSPF, a few static routes, and route maps. We are struggling to find a solution that offers the port speeds we use, can handle the BGP tables, and is cost effective.\n We are primarily a Cisco shop, mostly using secondhand gear. I realize our needs may push us to purchasing something new and that's fine if it is the case.\n I stumbled across the Cisco NCS line and it looks like it might be up our alley. I was mostly interested in something like the 5504 or 5508 so we could grow it as we grow. The licensing has me tripped up a little bit though. I see them secondhand but I'm not so sure I can just buy one and it would work. I guess my main question is do these things require ongoing licensing and if so can I buy one used and purchase a license for it? Or do I need to go through a reseller and purchase one new.\n I'm also open to alternative solutions. Our current Edge router is using 2 100G ports and 4 40G ports. We have quite a few 10G ports on it as well. I've been looking at Juniper's stuff and also considered looking at a whitebox solution such as Edge-Core. If we go with something else I prefer something as close to Cisco CLI as possible. Money is always an issue... we have it but I have to beg to get it. The worst part is going through all of the sales calls with each vendor just to get pricing information so I was hoping to get some solid ideas before I go through all of that.\n    submitted by    /u/168shades  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a directive from about, we're now looking at another SaaS type network monitoring solution. The solution seems to be far from mainstream (not going to mention by name, but HPE just bought them). There seems to be little information about anybody experience using it, but someone one of our VPs used to work with use it, and so it comes recommended and seems to be what we're going to be using soon. \n We are a very heavy Grafana shop. The vast majority of our application stack and business process flow monitored with Grafana. It's seemingly the Go To solution for most of our monitoring....except for infrastructure (network/servers). \n The primary driver to the proposed migration is cost. New vendor says they can save us tons, and we can eliminate Orion and PagerDuty. I'm questioning since we are so heavily using Grafana why we aren't at least considering it for infrastructure, I suggested we at least explore a small POC to see how it would work for what we need. \n Is there anyone out there using Grafana for their infrastructure monitoring? Horror or success stories?

We don't need to keep and store all the data that was transferred, just the connection/header info mentioned above.\n Does anyone know of a good (maybe open-source/free) platform that could provide similar analysis/logging as compared to NetFlow, but based only on gathering mirrored network traffic? We aren't looking for something inline, just need to be able to go back in time and see what traffic flows are associated with a particular IP/host.

So two different circuits and they handle the IP failover.\n The two CISCOs are directly connected to each other.\n I have this connected into 2 x HP 2530 Switches on a dedicated VLAN for the WAN connection.\n So CISCO1 ETH0 goes to Switch 1 port 48 and CISCO2 ETH0 goes to Switch 2 port 48\n There is a fibre connection between the two HP switches just carrying the VLAN for the WAN connections. This is done via a HP LACP trunk and STP.\n Each of the HP Switches then has a connection to two internal fibre switches on an LACP Trunk carrying just the Management VLAN only. To allow access for managing the switches etc.\n We then have a port configured on each switch to uplink to our Watchguard HA Firewalls for WAN VLAN\n Basically the issue is when the two ISP WAN connections are connected to the required HP switch port 48 our end it creates a loop and kills the network. If I leave loop protect enabled it will block the port, then unblock, then block and cause issues.\n So essentially it's blocking the link to one of the ISP routers ports that's dedicated for the WAN uplink.\n I have tried putting the WAN ports on a HP Trunk as untagged and still it kills the network ports and then connectivity.\n ​\n I'm running out of ideas currently.

          "description": "Hi!\n I have a quick question. We had a special solution made for an apartment building due to lack of ports, so we took 1 port (port 13) from our layer 3 switch, configured it with 11 vlans and then sent it to a layer 2 switch in the basement of that buildning and distributed the ports to each apartment, 11 in total. Worked fine but now that layer 2 switch died, and we have no good sized replacement for it unless we want to set up an entire layer 3 24 port switch which would be quite expensive. \n The question is, can I configure 2 (6port) + WAN + Fibre CPEs. Where the first CPE takes Vlans 330,331,332,333,334 on the first 5 ports, then connect the second CPE to port 6, carry over the last 6 vlans, and put them on the 6 ports of the second CPE, in order to chain them, given correct configuration on the CPEs ofc. \n Hopefully this was explained somewhat comprehensible. \n    submitted by    /u/Advanced_Classic5657  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all!\n I have been tasked with putting together a package for an AV company that puts on events. They want to do an ad-hoc network that will support up to 300 wireless clients at a time. The use case is simply to provide public wifi to check emails, browse, social media, etc. The AP/switching/routing portion is pretty easily accomplished. We plan on implementing client isolation, of course, and bandwidth limiting each client to about 2 Mbps. So total throughput really would only need to be 600Mbps if all devices were running full tilt.\n They want to use cellular to connect to WAN, and so my first thought was Cradlepoint. Specifically looking at this one https://cradlepoint.com/product/endpoints/w1850-series/ . The data sheet states that it can do 2 Gbps passthrough... so im assuming this is factoring in download AND upload. But for anyone that actually uses these things.... are you getting ANYWHERE near that speed? I understand that not all devices are created equal... but I have a 5g modem for traveling and it gets around 20Mbps... my cell phone gets around 2.\n This would be in the seattle metro area so coverage from all carriers is excellent in most places.

          "description": "So I have a project that requires me to run some fiber to a remote site but then I am out of SFP and can't fit more in the space I'm at, but I need to go from the remote site to an other spot to power a WiFi AP.\n The AP can only do 2.5 but hooked to a 1gbit link. I've done 105M runs and was able to do 5Gbit, 10gb was unstable, although I didn't ground the connectors for that run.. \n Curious on your thoughts, or should I try a different approach? I have 120 but very very little space at the destination (light posts with mini enclosures). \n Thanks!\n Edit: Media converter it is. It is what it is. I found some nice compact weatherproof converters that should do the trick. Power it from a small 48VDC PSU. Expensive but fits the enclosure.\n Thank you all for your help.

          "description": "Hi everyone. I work in IT at a small local school district, and a few weeks ago, our ISP upgraded us from 1Gbps to 10. Our small Meraki network consists of three schools pretty close together, one more Elementary school the next town over, and one more Elementary even further away. The network originates in the Middle School and runs to all the others before getting routed back through the middle school. I want to make sure each schools' network is getting the max amount of bandwidth. I am seeing on our main MX switch that both the nearby elementary school and the high school only have one fiber cable going to each, it just looks like one strand and the other socket next to it is empty. Should I be looking to get another fiber strand going to each? And beyond that, should I look into upgrading the fiber cables that go between all the MS225 switches in our schools? Thanks for any insight.\n    submitted by    /u/MasterMaintenance672  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I know, I know... Unifi, bleh... But still, does anyone know how Unifi's IP conflict detection works under the hood?\n ​\n The scenarios are that Unifi switches and access points are being used. In no case is a Unifi gateway being used and so some other DHCP server is being used, either firewall of a different vendor or Windows Server.\n ​\n The reason I ask is because, while the feature of IP conflict detection is certainly useful and certainly sometimes correct, it also seems to be sometimes erroneous. \n ​\n For example, sometimes there will be an alert for an IP conflict, and thorough checking is done and through manual checking there does not appear to be an actual conflict. \n ​\n In another example, sometimes it will alert that there is an IP conflict on X subnet, but not specify which IP it detected in conflict. In what scenario would a Unifi switch or AP be able to detect \"a\" conflict but not a specific IP that is in conflict? \n ​\n Anyway, I could guess what mechanisms and logic are being used for IP conflict detection, but it would be helpful to know actual fact as to what's triggering the alerts, to help identify if it is an erroneous detection or to help track down the offending device(s). In many cases the networks are far away and being managed remotely, so just going onsite and tracking things down physically is not always an option.\n ​\n I've searched online but was not able to find much of any information at all about the internal workings of this feature. If anyone knows some details about it, I'd be grateful. \n    submitted by    /u/permitipanyany  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I'm looking for a bit of high-level guidance and appreciate your time. \n We have a networking partner we've been working with to upgrade our infrastructure to Meraki appliances. We have MX68CWs (spokes) at each branch and an MX105 (hub) at our HQ with site-to-site VPN setup. \n Our networking partner is telling us that Cisco AnyConnect cannot be used with these appliances and that we must use native VPN clients built into Windows and other supported operating systems. Yet, this documentation states that all these models are supported for use with AnyConnect. Note that we also use Duo Security and SAML for MFA-protected SSO logon to AnyConnect. \n Is our networking partner correct?\n EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone for your detailed responses.

It seems all vfis and x-connects peers are up but I'm not seeing the upes exchanging their mac's or mac's in the bridge-domain of the NPEs.
